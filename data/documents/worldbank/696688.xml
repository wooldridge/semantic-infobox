&amp;#12;&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. SECTOR OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.01   The water supply and sanitation sector in Ethiopia is characterized by: i) severe&#13;
deficiency of physical infrastructure for provision of water supply and sanitation services;&#13;
and ii) inadequate managing capacity in the sector institutions to handle policy and&#13;
regulatory issues, and to plan, operate and maintain the water supply and sanitation&#13;
services. This is, in part, a result of underinvestments and inadequate financial policy in&#13;
the sector during the twenty-year civil war.&#13;
1.02  Rehabilitation and Improvement of the Sector Infrastructure: The physical&#13;
need in the water supply and sanitation sector is overwhelming. Investments in the sector&#13;
were severely depressed during the previous regime. Access to sufficient and safe water&#13;
supply is very limited; only about 17 percent of the total population has safe potable&#13;
water, and sanitation service coverage is even lower. Water supply coverage in urban&#13;
areas, where some 10 percent of the population lives, is better (about 70 - 90%), but with&#13;
significant inequalities in the larger towns, especially Addis Ababa, where over half of the&#13;
people live in areas which have serious deficiencies in basic infrastructure and little or no&#13;
access to municipal services. Even the existing schemes are suffering from low production&#13;
level and high leakage of water. Of some 200 urban water supply schemes, serving 3&#13;
million people (including the satellite schemes), 80 percent require major rehabilitation or&#13;
additional construction. Currently, only 22 schemes are newly constructed, 7 are under&#13;
construction for additional capacity and 12 are under rehabilitation (the list of main urban&#13;
water supply schemes are attached in Annex 2). Of more than 6,000 rural water supply&#13;
schemes serving 17 million people, some 30 percent are not functioning properly due to&#13;
lack of maintenance. Water quality is also poor: problems include high bacterial pollution,&#13;
high fluorine and mineral content, salinity, and the existence of guinea worm.  The&#13;
population in Ethiopia desperately needs safe water and sanitation facilities to improve&#13;
health and raise productivity. The Government of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia&#13;
(GFDRE) plans to undertake this task, first, by carrying out emergency rehabilitation;&#13;
second, by building new water supply schemes for which engineering designs have already&#13;
been completed; and finally, by undertaking engineering studies for future expansion of&#13;
water supply operations. The emergency rehabilitation of the war affected northern part&#13;
of the country is already underway with support from the Emergency Recovery and&#13;
Reconstruction Project (ERRP, Cr. 2351-ET); GFDRE would now like to start the&#13;
nationwide rehabilitation and improvement of water and sanitation facilities. A list of&#13;
projects in GFDRE water sector development plan is available in the Project File.&#13;
1.03   Capacity Building of the Sector Institutions: A basic condition for the success&#13;
of such a program is the development of adequate capacity in the water supply and&#13;
sanitation institutions. These include: the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR); the&#13;
Regional Governments and Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA); and&#13;
other related Ministries and their affiliated institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.04  Subsequent to the devolution of power to the Regional Governments in 1993,&#13;
water supply and sanitation operations, which had previously been managed by central&#13;
water agencies, are being decentralized to the Regional Governments. Details of sector&#13;
institutions and the regionalization exercises are provided in the Section B (Sector&#13;
Organizations).&#13;
1.05  The new institutional structure brought about the urgent need for human resource&#13;
development and capacity building. For some of the Regions, transfer of personnel from&#13;
the central institutions to the Regional Government has been carried out on a limited scale,&#13;
and most of the Regional Governments do not have the experience to manage water&#13;
supply and sanitation schemes.  The newly-established MOWR requires additional&#13;
qualified personnel to effectively handle regulatory issues.&#13;
1.06  Management capacity in the water supply sector institutions is inadequate to&#13;
conduct sound sector planning efficiently, operate and maintain the operations, or ensure&#13;
their financial viability.  Most of the central institutions lacked sufficient  qualified&#13;
personnel: for example, 80 percent of the employees of the Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Authority (the precursor of the Water Supply and Sewerage Agency - WSSA), were semi-&#13;
skilled or unskilled workers. Financial management of the Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Authority and AWSA was very weak: the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority never&#13;
completed a consolidated financial statement for its operations until 1993.&#13;
1.07  Sector Objectives:  The main objectives of the sector, which are stipulated in&#13;
GOE's transitional economic policy and incorporated in IDA's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy, are to improve the health and productivity of the populations and to ensure the&#13;
long-term viability of water supply and sanitation operations in line with the Government's&#13;
regionalization policies.  These objectives would be met by: (a) rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of the water supply and sanitation infrastructure and operations; and (b)&#13;
capacity building of the Regional Administrations and water supply and sanitation sector&#13;
institutions. The achievement of the sector objectives would greatly contribute to the&#13;
alleviation of poverty, the primary development objective for the country, through better&#13;
health and higher productivity of the population, capacity development, income and&#13;
employment generation, and private sector development. GFDRE intends to achieve these&#13;
objectives initially through rehabilitation of existing water supply schemes, and then&#13;
through construction of new water supply schemes.&#13;
B. SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
1.08  Prior to the Government's policy of regionalization, the Water Supply and&#13;
Sewerage Authority had responsibility for planning, implementing, operating and&#13;
maintaining water supply and urban sewerage systems throughout the country, except in&#13;
Addis Ababa which had its own independent authority, AWSA.  Water resource&#13;
assessment and planning was carried out at two institutions, the Water Resource&#13;
Development Authority (WRDA) and the Ethiopia Valleys Development Study Authority&#13;
(EVDSA). There were two Government engineering and construction institutions under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
the Ministry of Works and Urban Development (MWUD): the Ethiopian Water Works&#13;
Construction Authority (EWWCA) and the Water Well Drilling Agency (WWDA). The&#13;
Ministry of Health (MOH) provided health education and rural sanitation, and supervised&#13;
some small scale rural water supply schemes. All the sector institutions reported to the&#13;
Water Resource Commission, which coordinated and supervised all the sector issues and&#13;
institutions.&#13;
1.09  In 1992, a new policy of regionalization of the government structure was&#13;
established by issuance of the NationaVRegional Self-Governments Establishment&#13;
Proclamation No. 7/1992. This policy was to provide greater autonomy for the regional&#13;
governments. Under this policy, a new institutional structure of government emerged&#13;
("Definition of Powers and Duties of the Central and Regional Executive Organs of the&#13;
Transitional Government of Ethiopia Proclamation No. 41/1993").  At the central&#13;
government level, a new ministry in charge of overall natural resource management and&#13;
environmental management, the Ministry of Natural Resource Development and&#13;
Environmental Protection  (MNRDEP), was established.   The Water Resource&#13;
Commission was abolished and its responsibility for supervising sector institutions was&#13;
assigned to the MNRDEP. For water resource management (at the central level), WRDA&#13;
and EVDSA were merged into one organization. WSSA focused on providing technical&#13;
support for the Regional Governments. At the operational level, the Natural Resources&#13;
Development and Environmental Protection Bureaus (NRDEPB) of the Regional&#13;
Governments have taken over the managing responsibilities for water supply and&#13;
sanitation operations from the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, except in Addis&#13;
Ababa where AWSA still remains an independent organization under the Region 14&#13;
Government.&#13;
1.10  In August 1995, following establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic of&#13;
Ethiopia, GFDRE restructured all the ministries. MNRDEP was restructured to focus on&#13;
water resource management and water supply and sewerage regulations, and a new&#13;
Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) was established. Most of the NRDEPs of the&#13;
Regional Governments were restructured to the Water, Mines and Energy Bureaus.&#13;
WSSA and WRDA were dismantled and their duties and functions were absorbed into&#13;
various departments of MOWR.&#13;
1.11  Thus, the following institutions are currently involved in the sector: (a) MOWR&#13;
and its associated central sector institutions; (b) the Water, Mines and Energy Bureaus of&#13;
the Regional Governments; and (c) other ministries involved in the provision of sanitation&#13;
services.  In addition, there are several donors and more than twenty active non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in provision of small scale rural water&#13;
supply services. The mandate and functions of these institutions are given below:&#13;
1.12  Central Government Institutions: The mandate and functions of MOWR and its&#13;
associated central sector institutions are as follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
(a)   Central Government Institutions:&#13;
*     MOWR has taken over the mandate and functions of MNRDEP,&#13;
WSSA and WRDA and is now in charge of water resource&#13;
management, policy formulation and regulation of the water sector,&#13;
provision of technical assistance to the Regional Governments,&#13;
studies on regulation and protection of water, design and&#13;
construction of dams and large-scale irrigation projects, and&#13;
development of master plans for river basins. Many technical staff&#13;
from MTNRDEP, WSSA and WRDA have been incorporated into&#13;
MOWR, providing continuity in its operations and its contacts with&#13;
agencies such as the World Bank; nevertheless, being a new&#13;
Ministry, it still has to organize its internal structure, recruit&#13;
additional qualified personnel and initiate a wide range of activities.&#13;
Details are in Annex 3 and its human resources are included in the&#13;
Project File.&#13;
the National Meteorological Service Agency (NMSA) conducts&#13;
surveys and studies of climatic and atmospheric conditions&#13;
throughout the country.&#13;
(b)   Regional Governments and AWSA:&#13;
the Regional Governments have taken  over the managing&#13;
responsibility for water supply and sanitation operations.  A&#13;
description of the Regional Governments and their human resources&#13;
are presented in the Project File.&#13;
AWSA. AWSA provides water supply services and waste water&#13;
and sludge disposal services for Addis Ababa under the Region 14&#13;
Government. A detailed description of AWSA is in Annex 4 and its&#13;
human resources are presented in the Project File.&#13;
(c)   Other Ministries and Institutions:&#13;
MWUJD used to provide urban sanitation services (except sewerage&#13;
operations) through the municipalities. Its future relations with the&#13;
Regional Governments are yet to be established. MWUD also&#13;
supervises WWCE and WWDA (see below).&#13;
*     the  Water Works  Construction  Enterprise  (WWCE),  an&#13;
independent government-owned construction contractor for major&#13;
water and irrigation works, is a new enterprise formed from the&#13;
EWWCA under the "Waterworks Construction Enterprise&#13;
Establishment, Council of Ministers Regulation No. 156/1994."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
S&#13;
*     WWDA is a small autonomous government-owned contractor for&#13;
drilling water wells in urban and rural areas under the MWIJD; it is&#13;
expected to be corporatized, and eventually privatized.&#13;
*     MOH provides health education, rural sanitation and supervises&#13;
some small scale rural water supply schemes.&#13;
1.13 Other Donors and NGOs. A number of donors and NGOs are active in the water&#13;
supply and sanitation sector in Ethiopia. The African Development Bank, the European&#13;
Union, KfW (Germany) and UNDP are the major donors in the urban water supply sector.&#13;
In the rural sector, Sweden, Canada, GTZ (Germany) and UNICEF have been most&#13;
active. Finland has recently begun a four-year rural water supply program. Other donors&#13;
involved in the sector include Japan, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. Further details&#13;
on the activities of the major donors are given in Annex 5.&#13;
1.14 NGOs are also active participants in the water supply and sanitation sector in most&#13;
regions of the country and have made a substantial contribution to providing safe water&#13;
and improving sanitation. Some forty churches and humanitarian organizations work in&#13;
the sector under the overall umbrella of the Christian Relief and Development Association.&#13;
In general, the NGOs have adopted low cost technologies such as boreholes, handdug&#13;
wells, hand and motorized pumps, protected springs, ponds, micro dams and latrines;&#13;
several have also experimented with alternative technologies such as solar power,&#13;
windmills and rainwater harvesting systems. Individual NGOs tend to concentrate on&#13;
specific areas of the country (e.g. Norwegian Church Aid in SEPRA; Oxfam in SEPRA&#13;
and Afar; Hope International in SEPRA and Somali; and Water Aid in Oromia, SEPRA&#13;
and Amhara).&#13;
C. ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS&#13;
1.15 Four main issues hamper GEDRE' s achievement of its sector objectives: (i) delays&#13;
in preparation of the water resources assessment and master plan and establishing the&#13;
regulatory framework (ii) lack of capacity in the new institutional structure, (iii)&#13;
inadequate cost recovery; and (iv) insufficient donor coordination.&#13;
1.16 Delays in Preparing the Water Resources Assessment and Master Plan and&#13;
Establishing the Regulatory Framework: Ethiopia has eight major river basins: Tekeze,&#13;
Abay, Awash, Wabi-Shebele, Genale, Rift Valley, Omo-Gibe and Baro. The Tekeze, the&#13;
Abay and the Baro are tributaries of the whole Nile basin, which has Sudan, Egypt and&#13;
Eritrea as co-riparians. The Abay (the Blue Nile) is by far the dominant river basin, whose&#13;
run-off is estimated at 52 million cubic meters, or half the total volume of river run-off in&#13;
Ethiopia. Brief summary statistics are included in the Project File.&#13;
1.17 Ethiopia has not yet completed a comprehensive national water resource master&#13;
plan. Preparation of such a plan will be initiated soon, with assistance from a bilateral&#13;
donor. Preparation of water resource master plans for the major river basins has been in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
progress to varying degrees: studies or recruitment of experts have been initiated for most&#13;
of the major river basins. For Tekeze river basin, a consultant teamn has been selected and&#13;
work has been initiated. For Abay basin, a consultant team has been selected and&#13;
mobilization is under way. For Awash basin, the surface water study has already been&#13;
undertaken. For Wabi-Shebele basin, preparation of a master plan is scheduled for 1996.&#13;
For Genale basin, preliminary capacity assessment has been undertaken. For Rift Valley&#13;
basin, a preliminary survey has been prepared and a study will be initiated soon. For&#13;
Omo/Gibe basin, preparation of a master plan is under way. For Baro river basin, the&#13;
lower portion of the basin has been studied and data for the upper portion is being&#13;
collected. GFDRE intends to share information with IDA once the national water resource&#13;
master plan is completed. The establishment of a water resources management policy and&#13;
strategies would facilitate future IDA assistance for major physical investments related to&#13;
the use of water.&#13;
1.18  The regulatory mechanism to reflect the new policies addressed in the Letter of&#13;
Sector Policy and the new administrative system in the water supply and sanitation sector&#13;
have not yet been established. Currently, two proclamations have been issued: the "Water&#13;
Resources Utilization Proclamation No. 92/1994" which defines the administration of&#13;
water allocation, rights and permits; and the "Definition of Power and Duties of the&#13;
Central and Regional Executive Organs of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia&#13;
Proclamation No. 41/1993" which defines the powers and duties of, among others,&#13;
MNRDEP (the precursor of MOWR) and the NRDEPBs of the Regional Governments.&#13;
However, establishment of a regulatory framework, covering the introduction of full cost&#13;
recovery principles, efficient allocation of water resources across the regions, and the&#13;
possible future participation by the private sector and the public, is imperative. The&#13;
regulatory framework should also include standard of service, water quality and&#13;
environmental protection, market entry and exit, financial viability of utility operations,&#13;
incentives and disincentives for performance, control of monopoly and enforcement&#13;
provisions.&#13;
1.19  Lack of Capacity in the Institutional Structure: The institutional structure in&#13;
the sector has been defined, including relations between MOWR and the Regional&#13;
Governments and awaiting issuance of proclamations.   Although  the Regional&#13;
Governments have, de facto, taken over the responsibilities and the claims for revenues&#13;
from the operations and maintenance of urban and rural water supply and sanitation&#13;
schemes, critical issues remain undefined, including the roles of the sector institutions,&#13;
functions of the water supply units (ex-WSSA branches) vis-a-vis the Water, Mines and&#13;
Energy Bureaus of the Regional Governments, management of cross-regional water&#13;
resources, and relations with budgetary system of the Regional Administrations. The&#13;
Regional Governments also lack management capacity and human resources at this stage.&#13;
Many of the Regional Governments have not yet established their human resource&#13;
requirements or filled the authorized positions. Their capacity needs to be developed as&#13;
soon as possible to facilitate a smooth transition of water supply and sanitation operations&#13;
from the central authorities. GFDRE's commitment to formalization of the institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
setup has been confirmed by the Letter of Sector Policy. The letter of sector policy is&#13;
attached in Annex 1.&#13;
1.20  Inadequate Cost Recovery:   Ethiopia's water and sewerage tariffs are&#13;
considerably lower than the economic costs of the water supply and sewerage operations.&#13;
Tariffs for most of the water supply schemes have not been revised for more than 15 years&#13;
and are not sufficient to cover operation and maintenance expenses, let alone capital&#13;
investments. Of the major urban water supply schemes whose tariffs are known, over&#13;
eighty percent have water tariffs equal to or less than ETB 1.0 per cubic meter for private&#13;
connections and public water points, which is not sufficient to cover operation and&#13;
maintenance expenses. In Addis Ababa, the uniform water supply tariff of ETBO.5 per&#13;
cubic meter has been applied to all the customers without differentiation for 43 years,&#13;
which has led AWSA to become a financially weak institution. A high proportion of the&#13;
rural water supply schemes are not functioning, since cost recovery has drawn little&#13;
attention of communities and donors. The tariffs for major water supply schemes are&#13;
shown in Annex I and detailed description of tariffs and financial management of water&#13;
supply operations in the Project towns of the Regions is in paras. 3.15-3.29.&#13;
1.21   GFDRE has agreed in principle that water supply and sewerage tariffs should&#13;
reflect adequate economic cost and that the cost recovery principles should be&#13;
implemented over time. In the context of the Third Policy Framework Paper dated&#13;
October 18, 1994, GFDRE has already established guidelines for pricing and cost recovery&#13;
for water supply and sanitation operations. The Regional Governments have agreed to&#13;
implement the new water tariffs. Some tariff increases have already been effected in towns&#13;
where new schemes or augmentations have been completed according to the guidelines for&#13;
water pricing issued in January 1995. For example, Aykel in Amhara Region and Moyale&#13;
in Oromia Region now have tariffs of ETBI5.0 for private connections and public water&#13;
points.&#13;
1.22  The "Basic Principles and Guidelines for Water Tariff Study" issued by the&#13;
Government in January 1995 and approved by the Council of Ministers in May 1995,&#13;
provides principles for pricing to achieve efficient allocation of economic resources,&#13;
ensure social objectives of fairness and equity and meet financial requirements for utility&#13;
operations. The efficient allocation of economic resources will be achieved through&#13;
improvement in operational efficiency, rehabilitation of existing systems and development&#13;
of least cost solutions.  The social objectives will be achieved by elimination of&#13;
government subsidies to utility entities and introduction of cross-subsidization among&#13;
different consumption and income groups, with phasing over 8-10 years, taking into&#13;
account the ability to pay of the various groups. The financial needs of the utilities will be&#13;
met by full recovery of investment costs, debt services, depreciation and operation and&#13;
maintenance costs; and by establishment of appropriate financial targets.&#13;
1.23   Agreement has been reached on the tariff increases required to meet the financial&#13;
covenants under the ongoing IDA-financed urban projects. Revised water tariffs have&#13;
been implemented for: (i) Assela and Shashemane in Oromia Region to comply with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Section 4.02 of the Project Agreement of the Market Towns Development Project&#13;
(MTDP) (Cr. 2103-ET); and (ii) Addis Ababa by AWSA to comply with Section 4.02 of&#13;
Project Agreement of the Second Addis Ababa Urban Development Project (AAIIUDP)&#13;
(Cr. 2161-ET).  It was also agreed that tariff revisions to recover operation and&#13;
maintenance costs would be implemented for all the project towns by June 30, 1998.&#13;
1.24  GFDRE's Relations with Donors: Donor coordination in the sector has been&#13;
inadequate. Generally, assistance has focused on physical construction and maintenance&#13;
of water supply schemes in individual towns or regions and there has not been consistent&#13;
consideration of overall sector policies. ADB, CIDA, IDA and KfW have separately&#13;
financed engineering design, rehabilitation and construction of urban water supply&#13;
schemes for towns in various Regions.  ADB, EU, IDA and Italy have financed&#13;
engineering designs and expansion of Addis Ababa water supply and sewerage systems,&#13;
responding to requests for assistance from AWSA. GTZ, IDA JICA, UNDP and&#13;
UNICEF have individually provided capacity building technical assistance in operations&#13;
improvement and sector policy establishment for the sector institutions. For NGOs, there&#13;
is an active forum  in Addis Ababa organized  by an NGO, Christian Relief and&#13;
Development Association, for periodic information exchange among NGOs in the country.&#13;
To date, however, involvement of Ethiopian authorities has been limited and issues such as&#13;
standardization of equipment have remained unsolved.&#13;
1.25  To establish etYective donor coordination, GFDRE will actively coordinate&#13;
dialogue with donors and sector stakeholders and, inform them of sector policy issues and&#13;
mobilization of the necessary financial resources required for future sector investments.&#13;
There has been some initiatives taken by the donors: UNICEF has conducted research to&#13;
collect information on donor and NGO activities in the water supply and sanitation sector.&#13;
An initial donor coordination workshop will be held by GFDRE in June 199'6 with&#13;
assistance from  an IDA project team.  Follow-on consultative meetings v. ould be&#13;
organized bi-annually during project implementation to facilitate GFDRF.'s donor&#13;
coordination.&#13;
D. BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
1.26  The Country Assistance Strategy for Ethiopia was discussed by the Executive&#13;
Directors on June 16, 1995. The central objective of the Bank's program of assistance for&#13;
Ethiopia is the reduction of poverty through a combination of sustainable economic&#13;
growth and employment generation; improvements in basic social services; and special&#13;
targeted measures to improve income, self reliance and quality of life for the poorest&#13;
groups and communities. Economic growth is the essential basis of a long-term strategy&#13;
to reduce poverty through increased employment and food production. The aim of the&#13;
Bank's program is to promote this growth through: support for a policy framework that&#13;
will stimulate production, export, and private sector growth; a reliable flow of inputs for&#13;
the productive sectors; essential improvement and expansion of infrastructure;&#13;
environmental rehabilitation and conservatior and institutional capacity building essential&#13;
for sustainable economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
1.27  The Bank's water sector program is aimed at assisting GFDRE's achievement of&#13;
the sector objectives -- establishment of a sound sector policy,  rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of the sector infrastructure, and strengthening of sector institutional&#13;
capacity. IDA's operations would consist of on-going activities under the existing&#13;
portfolio and two phases of future activities. The activities under the existing portfolio&#13;
include augmentation of two water supply schemes in Oromia Region under MTDP;&#13;
expansion of a water supply and sanitation scheme in the suburbs of Addis Ababa under&#13;
AAIIUDP; and supply of emergency equipment under the water supply component of&#13;
ERRP. The first phase of future activities is to focus on resolving policy issues, building&#13;
management capacity and rehabilitating the existing water supply schemes through FY97.&#13;
This will be carried out through lending operations and other non-lending instruments.&#13;
The lending operations consist of this Project: the proposed Social Rehabilitation and&#13;
Development Fund Project which will focus, among others, on rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation; and a Health Sector Project, which will assist improvement of sanitation. The&#13;
non-lending instruments include the Policy Framework Paper, Economic and Sector Work&#13;
and the Public Expenditure Review, which will review progress on overall private sector&#13;
participation in the sector and follow-up on cost recovery principles. The second phase&#13;
would be to provide support for investments in physical expansion of the sector&#13;
infrastructure and for continued capacity building after FY97. This phase would include a&#13;
follow-on investment project for the project towns and an investment project for&#13;
augmentation of water supply system and sanitation in Addis Ababa. A summary of IDA's&#13;
strategy and relations with other donors is presented in Table I below:&#13;

1.28 The Bank's involvement in the water supply sector began in the early 1 970s with a&#13;
loan to AWSA for improvements to its water supply system (Ln. 81 8-ET). Since the early&#13;
1980s, the Bank has continued its involvement through the UNDP/WB Regional Water&#13;
and Sanitation Group water program aimed at supporting the development of urban and&#13;
rural water and sanitation systems.  Currently, the Bank provides financing for the&#13;
upgrading of the water supply schemes in two towns and parts of Addis Ababa as&#13;
components of the MTDP and the AAIIUDP. In 1992, some of the funds provided under&#13;
the MTDP were re-allocated to the ERRP to assist procurement of spare parts and&#13;
equipment for the water supply systems in the war-affected northern part of the country.&#13;
E. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.29 Lessons learned from Bank's operational experiences in the sector have been&#13;
incorporated in the design of the Project. OED's 1992 review' of the Bank's 120 water&#13;
supply and sanitation projects from 1967 to 1989 points to the need to have: (i) a&#13;
comprehensive water resource management strategy; (ii) an appropriate sector regulatory&#13;
framework; (iii) sufficient autonomy of water supply and sanitation institutions; (iv)&#13;
appropriate tariff levels and structure: (v) clear measures to reduce unaccounted-for&#13;
water; (vi) a human resource management system; (vii) better assessment of environmental&#13;
impact; (viii) better assessment of poverty alleviation; and (iv) better compliance with&#13;
covenants. The comprehensive water resource management study is under way at&#13;
GFDRE's initiative. The establishment of an appropriate sector regulatory framework&#13;
would be one of the major outputs under the Project. Autonomy of the executing&#13;
agencies would be reviewed in the context of establishing the new sector institutional&#13;
framework. Water tariffs for Addis Ababa, Shashemane and Assela have been increased in&#13;
accordance with the financial covenants of the two on-going urban projects; and tariff&#13;
increases to cover operation and maintenance costs would be implemented in all the&#13;
project towns by June 30, 1998.  The technical management study would include&#13;
identification of physical and commercial causes for the unaccounted-for water; a quick&#13;
rehabilitation program for reducing unaccounted-for water would be part of the Project&#13;
for the project towns in the Regions and part of the follow-on investment project in Addis&#13;
Ababa. For the assessment of the Project's impact on poverty alleviation, socio-economic&#13;
monitoring indicators and baseline data would be established through the baseline study&#13;
under the Project.&#13;
1.30 A review of 24 water supply and sanitation projects in the Africa Region in 1993&#13;
indicated that the improvement of performance of water utilities requires: (i) earnest&#13;
efforts to build local capacity; (ii) private sector participation; and (iii) demand driven&#13;
planning and management. Capacity building at the regional level is the primary objective&#13;
of the Project. Higher participation of the sector stakeholders in sector planning would be&#13;
reviewed and proposed by the studies under the Project and a pilot scheme to promote a&#13;

Operation Evaluation Department, The World Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
participatory approach for rural water supply development would be established with&#13;
involvement by NGOs and other donors.&#13;
1.31  In reference to AWSA's past performance, the Project Performance Audit Report&#13;
on the Bank's loan to AWSA 2 raised issues of: (i) difficulty in land acquisition; (ii) delays&#13;
in audit; (iii) inconsistent financial covenants; (iv) poor financial management; (v) high&#13;
level of unaccounted-for water; and (vi) lack of autonomy in deciding key policy issues.&#13;
The Project does not involve any land acquisition that requires resettlement. Audits under&#13;
the ongoing urban projects are now up to date. AWSA's financial management would be&#13;
strengthened by the technical assistance and training under the Project. Rehabilitation of&#13;
the distribution network would be carried out in the follow-on investment project in Addis&#13;
Ababa in order to reduce the high rate of unaccounted-for water.  AWSA's new&#13;
institutional charter provides AWSA's Board with sufficient autonomy.&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.01  Dialogue with Government of Ethiopia and its sector institutions regarding the&#13;
Bank's further support of the sector beyond the ERRP began in April 1992. These&#13;
discussions focused on capacity building and continued assistance for rehabilitation and&#13;
augmentation of existing systems in Addis Ababa and war-affected and neglected regions.&#13;
Based on these initial discussions, the idea of a Water Supply Development and&#13;
Rehabilitation Project was agreed upon and confirmed during the Project Concept Papers&#13;
discussion in October/November 1994.&#13;
2.02  The Project is consistent with GFDRE's sector objectives and the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy in that: (i) it will contribute to better access to safe water and&#13;
sanitation facilities for the population in the project towns and for the adjacent rural&#13;
populations, which will improve health and raise the productivity of the population; (ii) it&#13;
will support human resource development and capacity building for the Regional&#13;
Governments; and (iii) it will help define and establish a regulatory framework which is&#13;
conducive to the introduction of full cost recovery principles in the utility operations and&#13;
the greater involvement of various stakeholders.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.03  Project Objectives: The main objectives of the Project are to ensure the long-&#13;
term viability of water supply and sanitation operations in line with the Government's&#13;
regionalization policies and, in the long run, improve the health and productivity of the&#13;
population. These objectives would be met by providing assistance for: (i) capacity&#13;
building of the Regional Governments and water supply and sanitation agencies for&#13;
management of urban water supply and sanitation schemes and rural water supply&#13;
operations; (ii) formulation of policies to ensure long-term financial and managerial&#13;
viability of water supply operations, establishment of regulatory arrangements and sound&#13;
investment planning by the Regional Governments and water supply agencies; and (iii)&#13;
short- and medium-term physical rehabilitation, augmentation and establishment of urban&#13;
water supply and sanitation schemes in war-affected and the most deficient regions.&#13;

2.06   Criteria for Selection of Towns: The project towns were selected according to the&#13;
following five criteria:&#13;
(a)    the number of beneficiaries of water supply operations is generally more&#13;
than 10,000;&#13;
(b)    the town has strong development potential in respect to its administrative&#13;
functions, as an agricultural production and distribution and commercial&#13;
center;&#13;
(c)    the existing water supply schemes require urgent rehabilitation in regard to&#13;
the yield of sources, the production system such as pumps and generators,&#13;
and the distribution network;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
(d)   considerations of equity among regions, taking into account priorities of&#13;
the towns affected by drought and civil war; and&#13;
(e)   the lack of major assistance from other donors or NGOs.&#13;
2.07  A brief description of the Project towns and water supply schemes is available in&#13;
the Project File.&#13;
2.08  The details of the components are as follows:&#13;
A. Institutional Capacity Building (US$28.5 million)3&#13;
The objectives of this component are to improve Regional Governments'&#13;
organizational, financial and technical management of water supply and sanitation&#13;
operations; to ensure cost recovery; and to monitor sector performance, including the&#13;
socio-economic impact on the population. This component would cover various levels of&#13;
management in urban and rural water supply and sanitation operations, and is&#13;
complementary to other donor assistance for regional and central capacity building,&#13;
including the UNDP and UNICEF programs. The component comprises the following&#13;
sub-components:&#13;
(a) Water Supply Sector Capacity Building. This component consists of: (i)&#13;
studies, (ii) technical assistance; (iii) training; and (iv) provision of equipment, service rigs,&#13;
mobile workshops, vehicles and workshops.&#13;
(i)   Studies for the Regional Governments consist of: (a) an Organizational&#13;
Management Study to assess and improve the organizational structure, the&#13;
staffing and incentive system, and the management information system; (b)&#13;
a Financial Management Study to facilitate investment planning and&#13;
financial management in the Regions, including improvement of revenue&#13;
collection and billing procedures and development of a sound accounting&#13;
system; and (c) an Urban Water Technical Management Study to&#13;
improve the technical capability, design standards and operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) practices of zonal offices and water supply units of&#13;
the Regions.  These studies would be carried out for all Regional&#13;
Governments (except Addis Ababa) at the management level of water&#13;
resource departments, zonal offices and water supply units. In addition,&#13;
two studies would be carried out for the 25 project towns: a Baseline&#13;
Study to establish a basis for performance evaluation of the water supply&#13;
operations and their socio-economic impact; and an Asset Evaluafion and&#13;
Tariff Study to ensure the cost recovery of the water supply utility&#13;
3  Figures given are base costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
operations. The tariff study would be carried out in two phases: the first&#13;
phase is to identify the O&amp;M expenses of current water supply operations&#13;
so that immediate tariff adjustments can be introduced to ensure cost&#13;
recovery by June 30, 1998; the second phase is to ensure the long-run&#13;
marginal cost recovery, taking into account the results of the asset&#13;
evaluation and future investment plans to be developed under the&#13;
engineering studies under the Project. Terms of Reference (TORs) for the&#13;
studies are in the Project File; the implementation arrangements and&#13;
schedules for the studies are in the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
For AWSA, the Organizational and Management Study, the Water and&#13;
Sewerage Tariff Study and the Management Information Study, which&#13;
were carried out under the ongoing urban project, will be updated. The&#13;
update of the organizational study is aimed at establishing a solid ground&#13;
for implementing the new organizational and management structure. The&#13;
update of the management information study is to improve the efficiency of&#13;
system development during implementation of the recommendations of the&#13;
study. The update of the water and sewerage tariff study is to facilitate&#13;
implementation of the new water and sewerage tariffs in its new computer&#13;
system.&#13;
For MOWR, a Regulatory Study will be conducted to review the existing&#13;
regulations and propose a regulatory framework which is conducive to the&#13;
introduction of full cost recovery principles, efficient allocation of&#13;
economic resources, the possible corporatization of water supply&#13;
operations in the regions and participation by the private sector. The study&#13;
would be synchronized with UNICEF's assistance for MOWR to fortulate&#13;
rural water supply and sanitation policies. TORs for the study are in the&#13;
Project File.&#13;
(ii)   Technical Assistance for the Regional Governments would be provided to&#13;
facilitate implementation of the recommendations of the Organizational&#13;
Management Study, the Financial Management Study and the Urban Water&#13;
Technical Management Study. The technical assistance will comprise a&#13;
phase of orientation and work planning, a subsequent phase of design and&#13;
installation of new procedures and a final phase of supervision and&#13;
monitoring. In addition, short term technical assistance will be provided to&#13;
the water supply units of the 25 project towns for implementation of the&#13;
recommendations of the baseline study and the tariff and asset evaluation&#13;
study. TORs for the technical assistance will be prepared by the study&#13;
teams of the above studies. Implementation arrangements are included in&#13;
the Implementation Manual. Technical assistance would be provided to&#13;
AWSA to facilitate implementation of the updated organizational&#13;
management study and management information system study, including&#13;
implementation of the revised tariff structure in its new computer system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
The TORs for the AWSA technical assistance are presented in the Project&#13;
File.&#13;
(iii)   Training will be provided for personnel of the Water Resource&#13;
Departments of the Regional Governments, AWSA and MOWR. The&#13;
training would include the following aspects: (1) general management,&#13;
including top management skills, human resource, financial and information&#13;
management; (2) specific management skills, including supervision skills,&#13;
environmental  management,  maintenance   management,  material&#13;
management and customer service management; and (3) other professional&#13;
courses, including budget planning and preparation, legal matters, safety&#13;
training, maintenance of service rigs, pollution control and accounting and&#13;
auditing. For the Regions, training will be provided for grass-root working&#13;
level staff, mid-level management and top management of the bureaus,&#13;
departments, zonal offices and water supply units. A detailed description&#13;
of the component is given in the Project File.&#13;
(iv)   Equipment, Service Rigs and Mobile Workshops Vehicles will be&#13;
provided to facilitate the capacity building of the Regional Governments.&#13;
There are no private sector rig operators in the Regions, and the Regional&#13;
Bureaus themselves are responsible for carrying out maintenance of&#13;
boreholes and wells. To improve their capacity to provide preventive as&#13;
well as emergency maintenance, 13 maintenance rigs would be provided to&#13;
clean up boreholes and wells, and 13 mobile workshops to maintain&#13;
machinery and water schemes. The Regions have the capacity to maintain&#13;
the maintenance rigs; most of them have at least one qualified&#13;
mechanical/electrical engineer and mechanics and there are maintenance&#13;
facilities such as ex-WSSA regional workshops, private garages and other&#13;
construction site workshops available at the locations where these rigs&#13;
normally go through maintenance services. The Regions of Afar, Somali,&#13;
Benshangul and Gambella will, if necessary, receive additional assistance&#13;
from MOWR in operating and maintaining service rigs at the initial stage.&#13;
The training component will also include training of rig operators,&#13;
mechanics and artisans. Detailed information on the Regions' maintenance&#13;
capacity is included in the Project File. In addition, the water supply unit in&#13;
each  project town would be provided with a vehicle to facilitate&#13;
implementation and subsequent operation of the rehabilitated schemes.&#13;
Miscellaneous equipment, water meters and vehicles would be provided to&#13;
AWSA to improve its maintenance and operational capacity and help to&#13;
implement the new water and sewerage tariffs. A list of equipment, mobile&#13;
workshops, maintenance rigs and vehicles is included in Annex 6.&#13;
(b) Rural Water Supply (RWS) Pilot Scheme.   The main thrust of this&#13;
component is to explore how community involvement, particularly management of&#13;
completed schemes, can improve cost-efficiency and long term  sustainability.  The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
following achievements are expected: identification of good practices; establishment of a&#13;
framework for information exchange among communities and NGOs, development of&#13;
procedures for promotion of community managed projects, implementation of pilot&#13;
projects; and establishment of a rural water supply strategy for communities. The RWS&#13;
pilot component will be vested regionally with the respective Water Resources&#13;
Development Departments with assistance from the Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Department of MOWR. This component would comprise the following main elements:&#13;
(i)   Studies to review the current practices and institutional arrangements of&#13;
rural water supply schemes among different communities, regions and&#13;
NGOs and prepare appropriate national/regional strategies to improve&#13;
operations;&#13;
(ii)   Technical assistance and miscellaneous equipment to create a RWS&#13;
Forum for exchange and dissemination of experiences among the&#13;
Government, donors, NGOs and communities, centrally and in each region;&#13;
and&#13;
(iii) Construction of pilot schemes for testing and application of the detailed&#13;
strategies. It is envisaged that most of the pilot schemes will be constructed&#13;
voluntarily by partner members of the RWS Forum. In order to carry out&#13;
some independent testing, the project would also finance construction of&#13;
several schemes (about 6-15) in each of the regions. These would be&#13;
implemented through the regional bureaus, and will serve a training role in&#13;
the overall capacity building effort.&#13;
The community based approach, design standard and promotion strategies developed&#13;
under the pilot scheme component could be followed up by the proposed Ethiopia Social&#13;
Rehabilitation and Development Fund Project, which will have a substantial rural water&#13;
supply component (estimate at appraisal US$75 million).&#13;
A number of NGOs active in RWS development expressed willingness to work in&#13;
partnership with the pilot component and to contribute to the generation and sharing of&#13;
experiences. During the donor coordination meetings specific procedures will be worked&#13;
out for collaboration with NGOs which will allow them to retain their autonomy while still&#13;
being committed to the RWS Forum framework. Continuous consultations will be held&#13;
with UNICEF and other donors to ensure complementarity with their programs. Details&#13;
of the component are included in the Project File.&#13;
B. Feasibility and Engineering Studies (US$5.6 million)&#13;
(a) Water Schemes Feasibility Studies and Engineering Designs. This sub-&#13;
component is to provide assistance in the form of engineering designs for immediate&#13;
rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation schemes and for long-term investment&#13;
planning for future expansion of the urban schemes in the 25 towns. The environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
impact of the physical work will be assessed during the studies and engineering designs.&#13;
The component includes:&#13;
(i)    Rehabilitation studies to identify the immediate rehabilitation needs of&#13;
water supply schemes in the project towns, which would be carried out&#13;
under the component C(a); and&#13;
(ii)   Engineering  designs and  environmental assessments for future&#13;
expansion of the water supply schemes of the project towns, the physical&#13;
works for which would be carried out under the follow-on investment&#13;
project.&#13;
TORs for the above consultancy are included in the Project File.&#13;
(b) Building Works Designs. Designs would be prepared for the construction or&#13;
improvement of headquarters offices for the water supply operations in Afar, Somali,&#13;
Benshangul and Gambella Regions, which the currently have no administrative facilities,&#13;
and for the branch offices of AWSA. The physical work would be carried out under&#13;
component C(b).&#13;
C. Physical Works (US$19.7 million)&#13;
(a) Water Scheme Rehabilitation Works. Physical works will be provided for&#13;
immediate rehabilitation of the water supply schemes in all the project towns as per the&#13;
measures to be identified under sub-component B(a)(i) (Rehabilitation Studies).&#13;
(b) Building Works for Water Supply Headquarters and AWSA's Branch&#13;
Offices. Headquarters facilities would be constructed or improved for the regional water&#13;
supply headquarters in Afar, Somali, Benshangul and Gambella Regions. AWSA's branch&#13;
network will be upgraded through construction of six new branch offices and six storage&#13;
areas in order to improve its customer services.&#13;
D. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
2.09  The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$65.5 million, with a foreign&#13;
exchange component of US$29.28 mnillion, or 45 percent. Total project cost includes&#13;
physical and price contingencies and duties and taxes. Price contingencies have been&#13;
calculated on average annual price increase indices in the range of 4.50% to 2.50% for&#13;
foreign costs and 11.0% for FY95/96, 7.30% for FY96/97 and 5.20% for FY96/97 and&#13;
thereafter for local costs. Physical contingencies of 10% have been added to the base cost&#13;
of civil works and other physical works and 5% for consultancy and studies. A summary&#13;
of project costs is given in Table 4 below. Details are in the Project File.&#13;

2.10 The total project cost of US$65.5 million would be flianced as shown in Table 5&#13;
below:&#13;

The IDA credit of US$35.73 million, including a Project Preparation Facility (PPF)&#13;
advance of US$200,000, would finance 55 percent of total project costs; GFDRE would&#13;
contribute US$29.77 million equivalent including about US$9.6 million equivalent in taxes&#13;
and duties. Project funds will be transferred to the Regional Governments and AWSA as&#13;
part of the budgetary allocation. A Grant Agreement will be concluded between the&#13;
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and AWSA for the transfer of these funds. Signing of the&#13;
Grant Agreement will be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
2.11  Procurement of goods, works and services for all IDA-financed components will&#13;
be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and&#13;
IDA Credits, published January 1995. A summary of procurement arrangements is given&#13;
in Table 6. During negotiations, standard procurement processing times were agreed for&#13;
all key procurement activities. MOWR will report periodically on status of procurement&#13;
as per format agreed with IDA.&#13;

2.12 The implementing agencies (MOWR and AWSA) have demonstrated their&#13;
capability to handle procurement matters (including acquisition and distribution of goods)&#13;
under the ongoing Market Towns Development Project (Cr. 2103-ET) for the Assela and&#13;
Shashamene water supply components as well as for the ERRP component and AAIIUDP&#13;
(Cr. 2161-ET). The staff of MOWR are well experienced with the Bank's procurement&#13;
rules and have been kept up-to-date with the revision in the Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. The use of the Bank's revised Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents will be mandatory for the Bank-financed components.&#13;
2.13 Civil works and building contracts would be financed by GFDRE. IDA shall,&#13;
however, be satisfied that the selected contractors are capable of carrying out the works&#13;
and that costs are reasonable.4 Drilling works for rehabilitation and augmentation of water&#13;
supply schemes will be combined into single contracts within the regions and will be&#13;
procured on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB).&#13;
2.14  Procurement of goods (vehicles, equipment, and pipes and accessories) will,&#13;
wherever practicable, be combined into single supply contract(s) and would be procured&#13;
through ICB.5 MOWR will be responsible for the acquisition and distribution of goods to&#13;
the regional administrations and to the selected civil works contractors. AWSA will be&#13;
responsible for the acquisition of goods for the AWSA sub-components. Proper records&#13;
and accounts of materials and supplies as issued will be maintained by MOWVR and AWSA&#13;
which will be reviewed periodically by IDA and Auditor. Goods and office equipment, and&#13;
minor water supply equipment and spare parts under the Immediate Improvement works,&#13;
to cost less than the equivalent of US$20,000 each to an aggregate amnount of&#13;
US$200,000 may be procured on the basis of international shopping from at least three&#13;
suppliers from two countries. Proprietary spare parts for the rehabilitation and repair of&#13;
the existing electrical and mechanical equipment under the Immediate Improvement&#13;
component, to cost less than the equivalent of US$10,000 each to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$100,000 may be obtained from the sole authorized agent of the equipment. All&#13;
contracts with a value of US$100,000 equivalent or more will be subject to prior review&#13;
by IDA. Contracts below this amount will be subject to random post review (one in five).&#13;
2.15  Institutional and feasibility studies, engineering designs (including preparation of&#13;
bid documents and construction supervision) will be carried out by consultants to be&#13;
employed by the implementing agencies (MOWR and AWSA), whose qualifications,&#13;
experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to IDA.6 Such&#13;
consultants shall be selected in accordance with the "Guidelines for Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published in&#13;
August 1981. Consulting contracts with firms and individuals estimated to cost $100,000&#13;
4  The value of the individual civil works contracts are estimated to be between US$0.2 and 0.4 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
5   DA will finance the foreign exchange component.&#13;
6  The Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services (published by the World Bank in June&#13;
1995) shall be obligatory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
or more and $50,000 or more, respectively, will be subject to IDA's prior review including&#13;
all TOR(s), sole source contracts, etc., as indicated in the DCA. A three-month period is&#13;
allocated for the selection of consultants at project start-up in the implementation&#13;
schedule.&#13;
2.16 The General Procurement Notice will be published in the Development Business&#13;
Forum, at least 60 days prior to the issue of the bid documents.&#13;
G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
2.17 Disbursements from the IDA credit would be in accordance with normal IDA&#13;
procedures set out in the Disbursement Handbook (November 1992).  All consultancies&#13;
and advisory services and training would be financed 100% by IDA, except the&#13;
engineering designs and construction supervision for the building works which will be filly&#13;
financed by GFDRE. Civil works would be financed 100% by GFDRE, while the foreign&#13;
cost of all other components would be financed by IDA. Payments under US$200,000&#13;
equivalent would be on the basis of Statements of Expenditure.&#13;
2.18  The credit would be disbursed over four and a half years, beginning the second&#13;
quarter of FY96. The Project completion date is December 31, 1999, and closing date is&#13;
June 30, 2000. An estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 7.&#13;

2.19 To facilitate disbursements, an MOWR special account would be opened in a&#13;
commercial bank, with an authorized initial deposit of US$1 million, equal to three&#13;
months' estimated expenditures.  Until disbursements reach the equivalent of US$3.5&#13;
million, which is anticipated for the first project year, the initial deposit will be restricted to&#13;
US$500,000. MOWR would be the signatory for withdrawals from the IDA credit. In&#13;
addition, an AWSA special account would be opened with an initial deposit of&#13;
US$500,000; MOWR and AWSA would be the signatory for withdrawals.&#13;
2.20 Audit Arrangements: MOWR would establish one Project Account for all&#13;
regions. For the AWSA components, AWSA will submit its Financial Statements. The&#13;
MOWR Project Account, AWSA Financial Statements, the MOWR Special Accounts,&#13;
AWSA Special Account, the MOWR Statements of Expenditures and the AWSA&#13;
Statement of Expenditures would be audited by an independent auditor satisfactory to&#13;
IDA. The audit reports would be submitted within six months of the close of each fiscal&#13;
year. The accounting capacity of AWSA has been improving under IDA's on-going urban&#13;
projects: AWSA has cleared all audit backlogs in the past one year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

III. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION&#13;
3.01. The water supply operation units of the Water Resources Development&#13;
Departments under the Bureaus of Water Resources of the Regional Governments will be&#13;
the beneficiaries of the Project. To facilitate implementation and enhance ownership of the&#13;
regional components, a Project Manager will be appointed by each Regional Water&#13;
Resource Development Department.  Counterpart staff for the studies and technical&#13;
assistance will be explicitly appointed for the project activities. The Regional Managers&#13;
will have responsibility for day-to-day implementation; they will report to the National&#13;
Project Coordinator at MOWR through the Regional Bureau Heads of Water, Mine and&#13;
Energy who will have responsibility for supervision of quality of outputs under the&#13;
Project. The National Project Coordinator's Terms of Reference are in the Project File.&#13;
MOWR will coordinate and supervise all project activities, including signing of contracts&#13;
on behalf of the Regional Governments, except for the AWSA sub-component for which&#13;
AWSA would be the executing agency.&#13;
3.02. A Steering Committee with decision making powers has been established under the&#13;
chairmanship of the Vice-Minister of MOWR to supervise implementation of the project.&#13;
Steering Committee members include: the Chief Engineer, Senior Economist, Water&#13;
Supply and Sewerage Department Head, Contract Administration Department Head, and&#13;
Design Department Head of MOWR; and members from AWSA, Regional Bureaus and&#13;
related Ministries as necessary. The National Project Coordinator will be the secretariat of&#13;
the Committee and will report on progress of the Project and any issue which requires the&#13;
Committee's intervention.&#13;
3.03. Agreement was reached that contracts for the consultancy and advisory&#13;
assignments would be grouped into three geographical areas:&#13;
1.    Tigray and Amhara Regions;&#13;
2.    Oromia, Gambella and Benshangul Regions; and&#13;
3.    Afar, Somali, Southern Ethiopia People's, and Harar Regions&#13;
in order to ensure that the assignments will be carried out simultaneously in all regions in&#13;
the early phase of the implementation period. Such grouping would, moreover, encourage&#13;
mutually beneficial sharing of experiences between institutionally relatively stronger and&#13;
weaker regions. In the shortlisting of consultants, qualified local consulting firms would&#13;
be included, and joint ventures with international consulting firms will be encouraged, as&#13;
per the procurement guidelines. The engineering designs and construction supervision for&#13;
the building works will be entirely locally financed.&#13;
3.04  Management of Studies and Technical Assistance:  Special implementation&#13;
arrangements to manage the studies and technical assistance would be established to&#13;
ensure that they provide maximum benefits to the Regional Governments.  These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
arrangements are aimed at: enhancing ownership of the project activities by the Regional&#13;
Governments; establishing accountability in the process of skill transfer from the technical&#13;
assistance experts to the counterpart personnel; and ensuring sustainability of the&#13;
improved performance of the Regional Governments.&#13;
3.05  Ownership of the studies and technical assistance by the Regional Governments&#13;
would be enhanced by including MOWR personnel in the experts' team and by assigning&#13;
the Region's counterpart staff to the expert teams as required. The counterpart staff&#13;
includes the Project Manager, water supply engineer, economists or accountants and&#13;
extension workers. Accountability of the technical assistance experts in transferring skills&#13;
to the counterparts would be established by preparing detailed work plans for the experts&#13;
with clearly defined measurable outputs, by establishing an objective evaluation system of&#13;
technical experts' performance with feedback from top management of Regional&#13;
Governments and the National Project Coordinator, and by providing appropriate&#13;
incentives to the experts to the extent the contractual agreements permit. Sustainability of&#13;
improvement of performance would be ensured by providing the counterpart staff with&#13;
clearly defined work plans, incentive schemes and an objective performance evaluation&#13;
system; by establishing clearly defined exit mechanisms with time-bound performance&#13;
monitoring targets; and by coordinating the technical assistance with other training&#13;
activities. The appointment of counterpart staff (staff composition is specified in the&#13;
Implementation Manual). will be completed by June 1996 for the regional studies.&#13;
technical assistance and training under the water supply sector capacity building&#13;
component. Summary of the arrangements is presented in Chart 1 below.&#13;

3.06   An Implementation Manual has been prepared which sets out details of the&#13;
implementation activities and roles and responsibilities of the various entities involved in&#13;
project implementation. The contents of the Implementation Manual include a description&#13;
of the project, its objectives and cost; implementation arrangements, including&#13;
responsibilities and procedures; guidelines for procurement and disbursement; monitoring&#13;
and evaluation indicators; and the project implementation schedule and timetable of key&#13;
events. The Implementation Manual is in the Project File.&#13;
3.07   In  order to  facilitate  higher participation  of stakeholders in  the  sector, a&#13;
participatory approach would be adopted in the implementation of the pilot scheme of&#13;
rural water supply system  with the involvement of NGOs and other donors.    The&#13;
experiences and lessons learned from  this pilot scheme would be utilized for future&#13;
investments in the rural water and sanitation operations to be financed, in part, by the&#13;
proposed IDA-Financed Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
B. PROJECT MONITORING AND MID-TERM REVIEW&#13;
3.08  The Project Managers of the Regional Governments and AWSA will report&#13;
progress of project implementation to the National Project Coordinator at MOWR.&#13;
MOWR will aggregate the reports and submit them to the Project Steering Committee and&#13;
the Bank. The reporting will be made quarterly.&#13;
3.09  Progress with technical assistance will be particularly closely monitored. Detailed&#13;
work plans for consultants and Regions' counterpart staff will be developed with&#13;
measurable output. The performance of the consultants and counterparts will be evaluated&#13;
monthly by the Regions' management and reported to the National Project Coordinator&#13;
and the Project Steering Committee. The National Project Coordinator will closely&#13;
monitor quality of output, and will raise any issues to the Project Steering Committee. The&#13;
Regions will have opportunities to evaluate counterpart staff performance independently&#13;
because the expert teams will be rotated among the Regions.&#13;
3.10  Monitoring indicators to measure the impact of the Project on organizational,&#13;
technical and financial management, human resource development, community&#13;
involvement, socio-economic aspects and physical improvement of infrastructure have&#13;
been developed at both Regional level and Project town level and included in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual. For the organizational, technical and financial management&#13;
aspects, the indicators include efficiency indicators and financial ratios.  For human&#13;
resource development, various indicators related to staffing and training are included. For&#13;
community involvement, customer contact and public relations indicators have been&#13;
developed. For socio-economic impact, indicators, including infant mortality rate, burden&#13;
of disease, affordability and labor burden, have been established.  For the physical&#13;
improvement of the infrastructure, service coverage indicators, rehabilitation progress and&#13;
water quality are included. The Monitoring Indicators are attached in Annex 8 and in the&#13;
Implementation Manual. To expedite collection of baseline data, a draft letter of invitation&#13;
for carrying out the capacity building studies was submitted to IDA during negotiations.&#13;
Prior to credit effectiveness, the terms of reference for the preparation of the monitoring&#13;
indicators will be furnished to IDA. and the consultancy contracts will be awarded. By&#13;
November 30, 1996, target monitoring indicators will be agreed, based on the results of&#13;
the baseline survey, for review at mid-term and project completion.&#13;
3.11  Because of the geographic diversification of the project towns, IDA's supervision&#13;
requirements would be higher than normal engineering and technical assistance projects.&#13;
It is expected that IDA would field three supervision missions per year. An interim review&#13;
would be conducted some 18 months into the Project as a basis for determining progress&#13;
of project implementation and policy reform, and mid-course adjustments, if necessary,&#13;
according to the performance criteria to be established in the implementation manual.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached that an interim review would be undertaken&#13;
by September 30, 1997. A supervision mission plan is included in Annex 9; details are in&#13;
the Implementation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
Sector Approach&#13;
3.12  The Project has laid the basis for a sector operation approach. First, the Project,&#13;
which will be implemented in all the Regions in Ethiopia, covers broad policy issues&#13;
through the project preparation, the regulatory study and donor coordination forums.&#13;
Second, there is a strong support and ownership of the Project by the Regional&#13;
Governments, especially by the newly established remote Regions. The Regions proposed&#13;
the type of support and selected the Project towns. Third, donor coordination is a central&#13;
feature of this Project. A donor coordination forum will be held in June 1996, and bi-&#13;
annual donor conferences are planned under the chairmanship of MOWR. In addition,&#13;
there will be a rural water supply forum involving NGOs to facilitate exchange of&#13;
information and dissemination of good practices.  The policy issues, including cost&#13;
recovery and institutional structure, have been discussed with major donors and there is a&#13;
consensus on the conditionalities on these issues. Foreign technical assistance has been&#13;
kept to a minimum, considering Ethiopia's enormous demand for technology transfer.&#13;
There will be strong participation of local consultants and beneficiaries' counterpart staff,&#13;
and technical assistance will be phased out through a clearly designed exit plan.&#13;
Client Consultation&#13;
3.13  Each Region has been visited by the Project preparation team and their specific&#13;
requests for assistance have been discussed. In addition, the Prime Minister's Office has&#13;
held several seminars for the Regional Bureaus' management to discuss policy issues and&#13;
institutional structures; Bank staff participated in the seminars to discuss the issues and the&#13;
Project.&#13;
3.14  The ultimate beneficiaries of water supply and sanitation operations, the&#13;
consumers, have been consulted at public water fountains and communal sanitation&#13;
facilities during field trips to the Project towns. To ensure systematic client consultation,&#13;
the terms of reference for the various studies will include, where applicable, identification&#13;
of stakeholders and definition of a framework for their participation.&#13;
C. WATER TARIFF AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
1. THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS&#13;
3.15   Overall Financial Status of Water Supply Operations in the Regions: Due to&#13;
the low water tariffs, which have not been revised for over 15 years, most of the water&#13;
supply operations in the country do not recover the operations and maintenance&#13;
expenditures of routine operations.  Major maintenance and new  investments are&#13;
subsidized by the national and regional governments.&#13;
3.16  Financial Status of the Water Supply Operations of the Project Towns: The&#13;
financial status of the water supply schemes in the Project towns is generally characterized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
by insufficient revenue generation and inefficient cash management. The typical Project&#13;
town has an annual revenue of some US$14,000 - US$40,000, with fixed assets of&#13;
US$25,000 on an historical cost basis. Revenue has not grown over a long time of period&#13;
since the water tariffs have not been revised and no new investment to increase water sales&#13;
has been made. Revenues of most of the schemes are insufficient to cover operation costs,&#13;
such as fuel, lubricants, chemicals and wages. Maintenance and replacement costs are&#13;
barely covered even though depreciation charges are grossly understated since value of the&#13;
fixed assets is still based on historical cost. Revenue collection is generally poor: some of&#13;
them have outstanding balances of accounts receivable equivalent to two-year revenues.&#13;
As a result, there is generally a high outstanding balances of accounts payable since the&#13;
payment obligation cannot be honored due to cash shortages. Financial statements and&#13;
financial performance indicators of the water supply schemes of the Project towns are&#13;
included in the Project File (information on some of the towns is not available due to the&#13;
civil war and transfer of documents between the Regions).&#13;
3.17  Improvement Plans: Under the proposed Project, the Financial Management&#13;
Study for the Regional Governments will look into the current financial management&#13;
system of the Regional Bureaus, including a review of the current accounting system and&#13;
measures to improve revenue collection. The Tariff Study (Phase I) will help the Project&#13;
towns to restore accounting records and establish new water tariffs to cover operations&#13;
and maintenance costs (on historical fixed assets value). The Baseline Study, which will be&#13;
conducted with the Phase I Tariff Study, will include an affordability analysis and review&#13;
willingness to pay. Implementation of new water tariffs in the project towns to cover&#13;
operations and maintenance costs will be completed by June 30. 1998. The tariffs will be&#13;
required to be reviewed and updated bi-annually to cover operations and maintenance&#13;
costs. After the Asset Evaluation Study re-evaluates the replacement cost of the fixed&#13;
assets and the Engineering Design Study makes cost estimates of the future expansion&#13;
works, the Tariff Study (Phase II) will assist Regions to establish the water tariffs based&#13;
on the long-term marginal cost recovery principle.&#13;
2. ADDIS ABABA WATER AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY (AWSA)&#13;
AWSA Water Tariffs&#13;
3.18  Current AWSA  Tariffs:  AWSA's water and sanitation tariffs were under&#13;
government regulation until the new Board was established in 1993. The basic water tariff&#13;
of Birr 0.50/m3 has not been revised since 1948. The rental fee for a 1/2 inch water meter&#13;
is ETB1.00 and for a 3/4 inch meter, ETB5.00. For sewerage service, there is an initial&#13;
connection fee and an additional sewerage fee of ETB 0.40 applied for each cubic meter&#13;
of water consumed. The fees for disposal of sewage from pit latrines and septic tanks are&#13;
between Birr 25 and 30: however, due to the shortage of vacuum cars in the past, the&#13;
actual fees were raised to Birr 49.&#13;
3.19  Requirements of Tariff Increase under On-going Bank Project:   Under&#13;
AAIIUDP, AWSA is required to increase the water and sanitation tariffs in order to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
sustain its operation and maintenance activities, carry out replacement of fixed assets, and&#13;
meets its debt service obligations. The Project Agreement between IDA and AWSA&#13;
requires that AWSA, after FY91/92, generate total revenues equivalent to not less than&#13;
the sum of: (i) its total operating expenses; and (ii) the amount by which debt service&#13;
requirements exceed the provision for depreciation. AWSA did not comply with the&#13;
covenant for FY92/93 through FY94/95.&#13;
3.20 Tariff Increase: Following agreement reached between GOE and the Bank under&#13;
the Third Policy Framework Paper and the Project Concept Paper discussions in&#13;
October/November 1994, AWSA has agreed to increase water and sewerage tariffs,&#13;
starting in June 1995. The new tariffs maintain the current tariff structure, consisting of&#13;
the fixed charge (meter rent), volume charge, and sludge disposal fee, and are intended to&#13;
cover only a one year period up to FY95/96 until a modified tariff structure becomes&#13;
ready for implementation. The new tariffs are estimated to increase AWSA's total annual&#13;
revenue by over 200 percent, from ETBI17 million to ETB50 million. This is sufficient to&#13;
maintain a positive cash flow after operations and maintenance expenses and debt service,&#13;
thus, satisfying the financial covenants of the Project Agreement under the AAILUDP.&#13;
After FY95/96, the tariff structure will be modified to introduce more appropriate&#13;
customer classification to connection fees, network charges, volume charges and sludge&#13;
disposal fees. During the Project period, AWSA will continue to be required to maintain a&#13;
positive cash flow after operation and maintenance expenses and debt service are covered.&#13;
The new tariff structure, which was implemented in June 1995, is included in Annex 10&#13;
and financial projections for AWSA for the Project period are included in Annex 11.&#13;
3.21  Affordability of the New Tariffs: The new tariffs will not have an adverse effect&#13;
on the poor since the volume charge for public fountain operators will remain at ETB0.5&#13;
per M3 and the low income group is not served by individual standpipes or house&#13;
connections.  The current cost of hand carried water is estimated to be marginally&#13;
affordable to the poor. The population depending on public fountains and vendors is&#13;
estimated to constitute a significant portion of the population of Addis Ababa. This low&#13;
income group typically lives in wood and mud housing and the majority earn less than&#13;
ETB200 per month. Since the hand-carried water costs ETBO.50/M3 to ETB2.50/M3, it&#13;
is estimated to take between 2 percent to 20 percent of the household income. On the&#13;
sanitation side, these households are typically either served by a communal latrine or&#13;
utilize open ground; therefore they do not incur cash expenses.&#13;
3.22 Future Capacity Expansion and Tariff Perspective: Addis Ababa has been&#13;
facing serious water supply constraints: AWSA's current treated water production from&#13;
the existing Legadadi and Gafarsa treatment plants has been reduced to 125,000 cubic&#13;
m3/day due to safe yield considerations, while the demand for treated water is estimated&#13;
to reach over 500,000 m3/day by the year 2020. In order to meet the fast growing&#13;
demand, AWSA plans to undertake a series of capacity expansion projects for the next&#13;
twenty years. The following are AWSA's future investment plans (Table 7):&#13;

3.23   Based on the above investment plan, a tariff study has been made under AAIIUDP&#13;
which estimates that the economic long-run marginal cost of AWSA's water supply is in&#13;
the range of ETB2.8-3.4/M3 in constant 1992 terms.  In order to recover future&#13;
investment costs, future recurrent expenses, replacement of its fixed assets and debt&#13;
service, AWSA will have to gradually raise the water supply tariffs to ETB2.32 in financial&#13;
terms (constant 1992 ETB) by 2003. It was agreed under the Third Policy Framework&#13;
Paper, that cost recovery of water supply and sanitation operations of AWSA would be&#13;
achieved and this would be a condition of future Bank support for AWSA's investment&#13;
program.&#13;
3.24   AWSA Financial Management:   AWSA's financial management has been&#13;
hampered by a shortage of manpower and insufficient financial skills. Although a full time&#13;
acting financial manager has recently been appointed, there is a need to upgrade the skills&#13;
of financial staff, especially relating to the introduction of the new computer system,&#13;
incorporating the result of the Organizational and Management Study which was finalized&#13;
in June 1993.&#13;
3.25   Billing: Billing is one of the key components in AWSA's operations. It starts&#13;
from the reading of water meters at customer locations by branch personnel. Then the&#13;
water meter readings (customer water consumption data) are sent manually to the head&#13;
office to process customer bills by the mainframe computer system. The meter reading&#13;
and billing are performed every two months. The collection is made by branch office&#13;
personnel for most customers, while the head office is currently responsible for the&#13;
collection from some large account customers.&#13;
3.26   For many years, inaccurate and late billing to customers has been one of the most&#13;
critical problems of AWSA. About 20% of the water meters are not functioning, and&#13;
those customers are currently billed at a flat rate based on their previous consumption&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
levels. To alleviate this problem, AAIIUDP provides assistance for procurement of water&#13;
meters and extension of the meter repair/calibration workshop.&#13;
3.27  Besides malfunctioning water meters, it is alleged that the poorly designed&#13;
computer billing system and poor data conversion in the past have resulted in inaccurate&#13;
and late customer billing. Currently, there is no computer at branch offices and the billing&#13;
system can only be operated within the Computer Information System (CIS) at the head&#13;
office. The meter readings have to be inputted and processed at CIS. This centralized&#13;
operation has taken more time for the input data verification and yet failed to reduce the&#13;
occurrence of incorrect bills. Improvement will be made based on the recommendations&#13;
made under the Management Information System study to be updated under the Project.&#13;
3.28  Collection: For continuing customers, branch offices and the Finance Department&#13;
and CIS jointly perform their work in billing and collection in a two-month cycle. Due to&#13;
inefficient collection, AWSA has accumulated a high outstanding balance of accounts&#13;
receivable at end- FY90/91 of ETB 12 million, or over 8 months equivalent of the water&#13;
sales revenues. AWSA will reduce its accounts receivable to 120 days by end-FY95/96.&#13;
90 days by end- FY97/98. and 60 days by end- FY98/99 and thereafter.&#13;
3.29  Status of AWSA Audit: There are no outstanding audits for AWSA's Financial&#13;
Statements, Special Account and Statements of Expenditures.&#13;
&#13;

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. MAIN BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES&#13;
4.01  Benefits: The Project is expected to produce the following immediate benefits:&#13;
(a) the Regional Governments would develop improved technical, financial, planning and&#13;
administrative capacity to implement and manage urban water supply and sanitation&#13;
schemes and rural water supply operations at both water bureau and operational level; (b)&#13;
four Regional Governments would have administrative office headquarters and small-scale&#13;
service facilities to provide technical support for rural water supply operations; (c) AWSA&#13;
would develop a well-functioning financial management system, and administrative and&#13;
planning capacity as well as administrative facilities required to undertake major future&#13;
investments in water supply and sanitation schemes in Addis Ababa; (d) pre-investment&#13;
studies and consequent detailed engineering studies would be carried out for the 25 towns&#13;
in all the Regions to facilitate future sector planning of the Regional Governments; (e)&#13;
appropriate principles and management capacity for pricing and cost recovery for the&#13;
urban water supply operations would be established and implemented by MOWR and the&#13;
Regional Governments; (f) a sector regulatory framework would be established by&#13;
MOWR and the Regional Governments, which would take into account market entry and&#13;
exit, participation of the public, incentives for performance, control of monopoly and&#13;
enforcement of regulations; and (g) immediate rehabilitation of water schemes and&#13;
provision of maintenance rigs and mobile workshops will improve availability, reliability&#13;
and quality of water supply.&#13;
4.02  The development of management capacity and establishment of an appropriate&#13;
regulatory framework would contribute to the improvement of performance of both urban&#13;
and rural operations. The direct and immediate benefit of these improvement is, among&#13;
others, a reduction, in unaccounted-for water. The short-term minor rehabilitation of&#13;
water supply and sanitation systems in the project towns and establishment of&#13;
administrative headquarters would have a positive impact, primarily on urban and adjacent&#13;
peri-urban populations. A study and a pilot scheme for developing least cost rural water&#13;
supply systems would benefit the rural populations.  In respect of the physical&#13;
improvement of the sector, major rehabilitation of the urban systems in the project towns&#13;
would be carried out in a follow-on investment project, and actual investments in&#13;
rehabilitation and development of rural water supply systems would be made with&#13;
assistance of IDA's proposed Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund Project.&#13;
4.03   Although the Project is not a direct poverty intervention program,7 in the long run&#13;
it would have a particularly beneficial impact on the poor and women. A general&#13;
improvement in health arising from the provision of safe water and sanitation services,&#13;
including a reduction in intestinal morbidity and infant mortality, would contribute to&#13;
higher labor productivity of the population. Easier access to a reliable supply of safe&#13;

Summary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

water would relieve women of the burden of fetching water, allowing them to spend more&#13;
time on productive pursuits and caring for their families. In addition, the poor are likely to&#13;
be the major beneficiaries of employment to be generated through future follow-on sector&#13;
investments.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
4.04  Project Benefits: The economic benefits of the Project would include:&#13;
(a)    health benefits from the reduction in water-borne morbidity and infant&#13;
mortality,8 which would contribute to higher labor productivity of the&#13;
population;&#13;
(b)   reduction of women's and children's burden of fetching water;&#13;
(c)   consumers' surplus to be generated from an increase in water consumption;&#13;
(d)   potential increase in the efficiency of production costs and extension of the&#13;
lifetime of the water supply network due to improved managerial efficiency&#13;
and employees' productivity; and&#13;
(e)    potential reduction in unaccounted for water, both administrative and&#13;
physical, which is currently estimated to be approximately 40 percent of&#13;
total production, from improved managerial efficiency and immediate&#13;
rehabilitation of the water system.&#13;
4.05  For the economic analysis of the Project, two areas of benefits are quantified: (i)&#13;
the benefits from the incremental quantity of water supplied to the 25 Project towns,&#13;
including new water production and a reduction in unaccounted for water; and (ii) the&#13;
health benefits brought by a more reliable and accessible supply of safe water to the 25&#13;
Project towns and in other areas where maintenance service would be improved.&#13;
Approximately 550,000 people who live in 25 project towns and about 8.2 million people&#13;
who live in other areas where maintenance service would be provided are considered as&#13;
beneficiaries of the Project (this excludes additional potential beneficiaries in the adjacent&#13;
peri-urban population and Addis Ababa, in order to be on the conservative side of the&#13;
estimate). Shadow prices and exchange rates were not estimated since Ethiopia has been&#13;
undertaking a series of macroecomic reforms which have reduced distortions.&#13;
8  The second major cause of under-5 morbidity in 1990 was gastro-enteritis and colitis (this morbidity&#13;
rate was 13.4 percent according to the Ministry of Health, Comprehensive Health Service Directory,&#13;
1991), and about one quarter of all under-5 morbidity were water-borne related.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
4.06 Benefits from Incremental Quantity of Water. The incremental quantity of&#13;
water will be used by the beneficiaries to: (i) replace existing sources, e.g., water from&#13;
vendors, and (ii) increase water consumption.  Only benefits from  increased water&#13;
consumption were estimated. This gives a conservative estimation of benefits, since we&#13;
have not estimated the consumers' surplus due to replacing water from vendors because of&#13;
lack of reliable information related to vendor water prices beyond the 25 project towns.&#13;
The benefits from replacing vendor water could be substantial given that people are paying&#13;
ETB 5 to 25 per m3 of water. The following facts and assumptions are used:&#13;
(a) water consumption in the 25 project towns will increase from the current 7&#13;
liter per person per day (Ipd) to 15 lpd by the year 2000 and will be gradually&#13;
increased to the national standard of 20 lpd by the year 2003;&#13;
(b) water consumption in the other areas, where maintenance service will be&#13;
improved with the equipment acquired through the project, will increase from&#13;
the current 15 liter per person per day (Ipd) to 16 lpd by the year 1998;&#13;
(c) the average current tariffs, ranging from ETB 0.5 to ETB 2.5 in the project&#13;
towns, will be gradually increased to an average tariff of ETB 2.5 by the year&#13;
2000; 9 and&#13;
(d) Unaccounted for water in the 25 project towns will be gradually reduced from&#13;
40 percent to about 30 percent to the year 2005.&#13;
The NPV of the benefits from increased water supply is US$31.5 million. The details are&#13;
presented in Annex 12.&#13;
4.07  Health Benefits. We have included health benefits in the calculation to take into&#13;
account the expected improvements in water quality, which may not be captured by the&#13;
current willingness to pay by consumers. However, to avoid duplication, we have only&#13;
included 50 percent of the estimated health benefits. To be on the conservative side as&#13;
well, these benefits do not include the benefits of higher productivity brought about by an&#13;
improvement in the health of the population. The following assumptions and data are&#13;
used:&#13;
(a)   prevailing rates of water-borne disease which is, on average, 45/1000 in a&#13;
two-week period; average days of restricted activity (6.2 days per&#13;
incidence); and average expenditure on treatment of disease (ETB 17.5 per&#13;
capita per year);'0&#13;
(b)   a current average of US$130 per capita income and an average annual two&#13;
percent growth; and&#13;
9  The tariff of ETB 2.5/m3 is taken as a proxy to willingness to pay.&#13;
10  From the Central Statistical Office report on Rural Health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
(c)   it is assumed that the economically active population lose 80 percent of&#13;
their income when they are sick due to water-borne disease. For the&#13;
younger and older population, only 20 percent of their income per capita is&#13;
assumed to be lost when they are sick."&#13;
From these assumptions, about US$4 are estimated to be lost per capita due to water&#13;
borne/wash diseases. Only half of this amount, however, has been used to estimate the&#13;
health costs caused by water bome/wash diseases. The present value of the savings on&#13;
health costs is estimated at US$18.0 million.&#13;
4.08   Project Costs and Least Cost Solution: Project costs include both investment&#13;
and recurrent costs. To carry out the economic analysis, investment costs were calculated&#13;
for the rehabilitation of the water supply facilities of the 25 towns which total US$11.4&#13;
million (net of duties and taxes, but including physical contingencies), or 23 percent of&#13;
total investment. The capacity building components, including studies, training, technical&#13;
assistance and institutional support (equipment and buildings), have also been included in&#13;
the project costs because they will have a positive impact on the supply of water. The&#13;
capacity building and institutional support activities which are aimed at the 25 project&#13;
towns have been included in full amount, while the ones directed to regions have been&#13;
apportioned according to the number of towns to be serviced or rehabilitated under the&#13;
project relative to the total number of towns in the regions. These capacity building&#13;
components total about US$13.3 mnillion, bringing the total costs to US$ 24.7. Recurrent&#13;
costs are estimated at about US$2.9 million per year for the 25 towns and other regional&#13;
towns, increasing with the increase in output. All costs are calculated taking into account&#13;
the least cost of rehabilitation and O&amp;M, including physical contingencies. The NPV of&#13;
the project costs (both investment and O&amp;M) due to the Project is US$38.8 million.&#13;
4.09 Economic Rate of Return. The estimated economic rate of return (ERR) of the&#13;
water supply rehabilitation and capacity building components is 18.4% (See Table I in&#13;
Annex 12). The net present value of the rehabilitation works and capacity building at a 12&#13;
percent discount rate is US$10.6 million. The benefit cost ratio is 1.27.&#13;
4.10  Project Risks and Sensitivity Analysis: The major risk to this Project is that&#13;
GFDRE would delay implementing key policy issues, including establishment of an&#13;
appropriate institutional framework and implementation of tariff increases. An additional&#13;
risk is that the project management capacity of the newly created regional administrations&#13;
may not improve as fast as desired. To mitigate these risks technical assistance, training&#13;
and conditionalities will be provided. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the&#13;
effect of these risks on the expected returns of the Project. Five variables were taken into&#13;
account: (i) delays in tariff increase; (ii) lower water consumption; (iii) higher operating&#13;
This percentage is smaller for this segment of the population since their participation in income&#13;
generating activities is smaller, but has to include the burden to the adults who might have to limit&#13;
their income generating activities to take care of sick children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
costs; (iv) prolonged implementation period; and (v) smaller health benefits. If the tariffs&#13;
are increased only to ETB 1.65 by year 2000, the ERR would be reduced to 12.0 percent.&#13;
If water consumption reaches only 8.2 lpd, instead of 15 lpd by the year 2000, the ERR&#13;
will be 12.0 percent. If the investment and O&amp;M costs are 23 percent higher than the&#13;
estimated US$24.7 million and US$2.9 million per year, the ERR will be reduced to 12.0&#13;
percent. If we include only 20 percent of the health benefits, compared with the base case,&#13;
the ERR would be 12.0 percent. Two years' delay in implementation of the project&#13;
(including higher O&amp;M costs due to delay) will lower the ERR to 12.4 percent. The&#13;
summary is in Table 8 below.&#13;

2 Year Delay in Implementation&#13;

4.11  Poverty Impact and Affordability: The project will improve water supply for&#13;
about 8.7 million people in small towns with relatively high poverty. Most water&#13;
consumption in these towns is for domestic use, with very small amounts used for&#13;
commercial or institutional uses. In a survey carried out by WSSA in 198912, for a town&#13;
with similar characteristics, about 52% of the population had an annual per capita income&#13;
of US$97 or less, which means that this project, serving a similar population, will benefit a&#13;
large percentage of poor. The current tariff varies from ETB 0.5 to ETB 2.5 per cubic&#13;
meter of water in the project towns. As noted in para 3.15, tariffs have not been raised in&#13;
some of the towns for decades, therefore, this increase is included in the Government&#13;
12 WSSA and DEVECON, Five Towns Water and Sanitation Study, Phase I Report, Volume I - Gore,&#13;
1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
strategy for the sector. People interviewed expressed their willingness to pay higher tariffs&#13;
as long as water is available; many of them are already paying vendors from ETB 12.5 in&#13;
the wet season to ETB 25 in the dry season, per cubic meter of water. In two towns&#13;
where water supply schemes have been constructed, the water tariffs have been increased&#13;
to ETB 5.00. At the estimated tariff of ETB 2.5, the cost of water in 2000 would&#13;
constitute some 2 percent of an average household income, which is less than in other&#13;
African countries. If a progressive tariff structure is introduced, the burden on poor&#13;
households could be reduced. This aspect will be further analyzed under the Project.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
4.12   Since the Project would not involve any major civil works, no adverse&#13;
environmental impact is expected. The Project would, in the long run, contribute to the&#13;
improvement of the environment in the form of safe water and better sanitation for the&#13;
local populations. The Project has a "C" environmental rating. All costs are calculated&#13;
taking into account the least cost design of schemes estimated at appraisal.&#13;
4.13  Environmental Assessment: The integration of environmental concerns in the&#13;
water sector is one of the major subjects of studies and training under the Project. The&#13;
engineering studies and design component includes an environmental assessment of the&#13;
impact of the works for construction and expansion of the new water supply schemes to&#13;
be carried out under the future follow-on project. The technical assistance sub-component&#13;
for technical management of water supply operations and the training component include&#13;
mitigation of any adverse environmental impact of water supply operations and&#13;
environmentally sustainable planning methods.&#13;
4.14   Riparian Issue: Since the Project only involves minor rehabilitation of existing&#13;
systems and engineering studies, it will not have any impact on other riparians and will not&#13;
be appreciably harmed by the other riparians' possible water use. Among the 25 water&#13;
supply schemes, only two towns have water sources from an international waterway or a&#13;
tributary of an international waterway: Gambella's water source is the Baro River, which&#13;
originates in Ethiopia, and Gebreguracha's source is a tributary of the Abay River, which&#13;
also originates in Ethiopia (Lake Tana). All the other schemes' sources are boreholes,&#13;
springs or domestic lakes. For Gambella town, no rehabilitation works or engineering&#13;
study for water supply schemes will be carried out under the Project since UNICEF is&#13;
already undertaking source improvement work. For Gebreguracha, since the immediate&#13;
rehabilitation work is confined to a minor rehabilitation of the existing scheme, the&#13;
scheme's nature and scope will not be changed and there will be no impact on the river.&#13;
4.15   Land Acquisition and Resettlement:  Land acquisition is required only for&#13;
construction of water supply headquarters in Afar, Gambella, Somali and Benshangul&#13;
Regions and there is no resettlement involved. All these Regions, including their capital&#13;
towns, are very scarcely populated. The sites, which have been identified, are already&#13;
used for other administrative functions of the Regional Governments or already reserved&#13;
for construction of the office buildings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
D. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.16  Sustainability: The Project is essentially designed to ensure the sustainability of&#13;
the water supply and sanitation operations by assisting capacity building of the sector&#13;
institutions, sector investment planning and establishment of an appropriate regulatory&#13;
framework.&#13;
4.17  Mechanisms have been built in to ensure accountable transfer of skills and&#13;
sustainable improvement of institutional capacity, the technical assistance and training&#13;
components to be provided under the Project.  Sustainability of improvement of&#13;
performance would be ensured by providing the counterpart staff with clearly defined&#13;
work plans, incentive schemes and an objective performance evaluation system; by&#13;
establishing clearly defined exit mechanisms with time-bound performance monitoring&#13;
targets; and by coordinating the technical assistance with other training activities. The&#13;
design of studies and technical assistance includes those features, as described in para.&#13;
3.05.  Financial sustainability would be ensured by appropriate water tariffs to be&#13;
implemented by the Regions.&#13;
E. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
4.18 The major risk would be delays in GFDRE implementing key policy issues,&#13;
including establishment of an appropriate institutional framework and implementation of&#13;
tariff increases. This risk would be minimized by confirmation of the Government's&#13;
commitment in the Letter of Sector Policy and upfront tariff increases. The project&#13;
management capacity of some of the newly created Regional Governments may not&#13;
improve as fast as desired; this risk would be mitigated by early initiation of capacity&#13;
building activities through utilization of the Project Preparation Facility and the proposed&#13;
technical assistance and training to be provided under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 5 of 17&#13;
1.    Background of Water Supply and Sanitation Sector&#13;
1.1   The status of the water supply and sanitation sector in Ethiopia, is&#13;
rather poor. Most of the population, urban and rural alike, do not have&#13;
adequate and safe access to potable water supplies or sanitation&#13;
facilities, leaving people vulnerable to a host of water and sanitation&#13;
related infectious diseases. Women and young girls are overly burdened&#13;
within the sector, as they are the main suppliers and users of domestic&#13;
water, and therefore, remain the most susceptible to water-related&#13;
illnesses. Environmental degradation is an immediate concern, with&#13;
grave implications for the provision of water and sanitation, severely&#13;
impairing the natural conditions of the country and resulting in a&#13;
forest cover of under 4 percent in 1990. In brief, over 70% of disease&#13;
in the country are water-borne diseases.&#13;
1.2   Adequate water supply in Ethiopia is defined as 20 litres/capita/day&#13;
available within a range of 0.5 -1 km from a dwelling. Sanitation is&#13;
defined only by accessibility to a latrine without consideration of the&#13;
status of such a facility, as well as the determination of its use. The&#13;
level of heath/hygiene education and the general awareness of the&#13;
population concerning potable water and safe environmental sanitation is&#13;
extremely low. Water quality is a major problem. Reports on water&#13;
quality from various parts of the country indicate that the existing&#13;
situation is far from satisfactory.&#13;
1.3   Existing data indicate that the overall coverage of water supply is 26%,&#13;
while the national coverage for sanitation is estimated to be 7%.&#13;
Further analysis of the coverage indicates that out of the total&#13;
estimated 46.8 million rural population only 9 million or 18.8% have&#13;
access to safe drinking water through an estimated 6000 different rural&#13;
water supply schemes. The water supply coverage in urban areas, where&#13;
some 10% of the population lives, is relatively better with about 76% of&#13;
them supplied with potable water. The urban percentage includes those&#13;
with low levels of services. Major problems in the urban water supply&#13;
services include, low production levels, inadequate distribution systems&#13;
and leakage in many areas, estimated to be more than 30% of the water&#13;
passing through the distribution network.&#13;
1.4   The existing financial policy for water supply is not adequate.  Current&#13;
tariff rates are not based on cost recovery and as a result, there is&#13;
hardly any room for rehabilitation and expansion of the schemes. Actual&#13;
investment for water supply are far below requirements particularly when&#13;
one takes into consideration the overall water supply coverage in the&#13;
country.&#13;
1.5   In summary, during the last several years, a number of constraints have&#13;
greatly suppressed the possibility of achieving the targets which have&#13;
been set for the water and sanitation sector. Water supply and&#13;
sanitation issues have not been addressed in an integrated fashion. Lack&#13;
of sufficient involvement from project beneficiaries have forfeited&#13;
success and sustainability of most projects. Inappropriate technology&#13;
and experimentation on low cost options has resulted in few affordable&#13;
alternatives. An urban bias for water supply and sanitation activities&#13;
has kept rural development at an all-time low. In the past regime&#13;
government allocations to the sector have been relatively low.   Poor&#13;
co-ordination among sector partners has resulted in excessive&#13;
duplication and no synergism.&#13;
1.6   The major factor that accounted for the existence of the above mentioned&#13;
constraints is the lack of sector policy. The purpose of this document&#13;
is, therefore, to describe the sector policies that the country plans to&#13;
follow during implementation of the proposed IDA financed and other&#13;
donors projects.&#13;

2.    Sector Objectives&#13;
2.1   The overall development objective of the sector is to improve the well-&#13;
being, health and productivity of the population by increasing coverage&#13;
and ensuring the long-term viability of water supply and sanitation&#13;
operations in line with the government's regionalization policies.&#13;
These objectives will be achieved through:&#13;
-     establishing the regulatory framework for the sector;&#13;
-     formulation of integrated water supply and sanitation programmes;&#13;
-     ensuring sustainability and efficiency through rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of the water supply and sanitation infrastructure and&#13;
operations;&#13;
-     construction of new water supply and sanitation in urban and rural&#13;
areas giving due considerations to least cost options;&#13;
-     capacity building, including institutional infrastructure &amp;&#13;
manpower development of the Regional Administrations and water&#13;
supply and sanitation institutions; and involvement and&#13;
participation of the communities, particularly women; this is&#13;
assisted by the community participation and promotion offices&#13;
established under zonal water sections.&#13;
2.02 These measures are supported by the following donor assistance programs:&#13;
-     The Regulatory Framework Study to be carried out by 1996 under the&#13;
IDA financed Water Supply Development &amp; Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(WSDRP) and the UNICEF's 1994-99 Programme output, through its&#13;
Water Supply Policy Development &amp; Promotion (WSPDP), will assist&#13;
in developing policies to be used as guidelines especially for the&#13;
development of rural water supply;&#13;
-     The integrated sanitation program is now underway with the&#13;
assistance of UNICEF's WISS programme in 64 "weredas" during the&#13;
programme period. FINNIDA is also following this approach under&#13;
its Rural Water Supply &amp; Environmental Programme (1994-1998) in&#13;
the Amhara Region;&#13;
-     Currently rehabilitation of 12 towns water supply schemes is&#13;
underway with a grant obtained from the government of Germany&#13;
(KfW). The proposed IDA project also addresses this issue and&#13;
implementation will be undertaken in some of the 25 towns;&#13;
-     Construction of water supply schemes is recently completed in 5&#13;
Towns (ADS financed), and underway in other 2 Towns with IDA&#13;
credit. In other 9 Towns (7 of them to be financed by ADB) it is&#13;
expected to commence in the 2M quarter of 1996;&#13;
-     Technical assistance and training will be provided through the&#13;
implementation of the IDA's WSDRP, the UNICEF's WSPDP and other&#13;
donors' programmes.&#13;
3.    Regionalisation (Decentralisation)&#13;
3.1   The national policy, understandably urges a rapid increase in the water&#13;
supply coverage of the population. Moreover, in order to improve the&#13;
sustainability of the water supply and sanitation sector, different&#13;
measures have been taken among which decentralisation of former WSSA&#13;
functions through strengthening of regional capacities is one of them.&#13;
The water sector was reorganised, in 1992, and again reviewed and as a&#13;
result the Ministry of Water Resources was established in August 1995,&#13;
to bring it in line with the general administrative changes being made&#13;
in the country. Strategic decisions concerning this reorganisation have&#13;

already taken place. Ownership of water supply schemes and&#13;
responsibility for their operation and maintenance has been passed to&#13;
the new administrative regions. WSSD, created under the Ministry, will&#13;
be reaponsible, by and large. for giving technical assistance for the&#13;
newly established regions. The decentralisation process shall continue&#13;
with added impetus stressing optimum utilisation of available resources&#13;
and the requirements of the New Regional Governments.&#13;
4.    Linkage with other Sectors&#13;
4.1   The Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR) is the overall authority for the&#13;
sector. The other important government agencies, either directly&#13;
involved or of particular relevance to the sector, are the following:&#13;
-     Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation (MEDaC)&#13;
-     Ministry of Works and Urban Development (MoWUD)&#13;
-     Ministry of Health (MoH)&#13;
-     Ministry of Agriculture (MoA)&#13;
-     Ministry of Finance (MoF)&#13;
-     Disaster Prevention &amp; Preparedness Commission (DPPC)&#13;
-     Water Works Construction Enterprise (WWCE)&#13;
-     Water Well Drilling Enterprise (WWDE)&#13;
-     National Meteorological Services Agency (NMSA) and&#13;
-     Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AAWSA).&#13;
4.2   Coordination among the sector partners, has been weak.  However, in&#13;
order to maximise the economic and social benefits, linkages and co-&#13;
ordination among the above sector partners shall be improved, and, to&#13;
this effect the government will oroanise consultative forums for&#13;
governmental sector Partners beainnina from mid 1996. Consultation&#13;
meetings will be held at least once annually. The MoWR will be the&#13;
chairman and secretary of the Meeting and the Vice Ministers,&#13;
Commissioner and General Managers of the sector organisations will be&#13;
members of the consultation meeting.&#13;
S.    Water Resource Management&#13;
5.1   Water for agriculture and community water supplies are areas that will&#13;
merit priority attention. Equally important will be problems related to&#13;
pollution of water resources. Still other areas of critical concern&#13;
include the incidence of floods and droughts, water for hydroelectric&#13;
power generation, industry and matters related to the utilisation and&#13;
management of shared water resources.&#13;
5.2   Assessment of the water resources is an important prerequisite to&#13;
planning, development, policy formulation and the operation and&#13;
management of water resources in their multiple uses. The establishment&#13;
of integrated, reliable data Eystems, to include the functions of&#13;
gathering, storage, retrieval, analysis, dissemination and use of&#13;
meteorological, hydrometeorological, hydrological and hydrogeological&#13;
data will, therefore, be a priority consideration. To this effect, a&#13;
study assisted by the Netherlands government under its 'miliev"&#13;
programme, (80% to be financed from the "miliev" facility) will be&#13;
undertaken beginning from mid 1996.&#13;
5.3   An integrated inter disciplinary approach to the formulation of water&#13;
policies and appropriate legislative and administrative arrangements&#13;
will be important components of national water management.&#13;
Considerations will include cost-effectiveness as well as social&#13;
benefits and environmental conditions. The creation of consultative&#13;
forum, indicated under 4.2 above, will help in the formulation of&#13;
Policies and guidelines aoorooriate to the realisation of such&#13;
oblectives.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 8 of 17&#13;
5.4   Appropriate legislation will be fundamental to the optimum development&#13;
of water resources. Provisions which regulate water management will be&#13;
enforced and will be periodically reviewed and updated. To this effect,&#13;
Water Resource Utilisation Proclamation no. 92/94 is issued in 1994.&#13;
Guidelines for the establishment of Water Committees has also been&#13;
prepared by the former WSSA and is being used by the zonal water&#13;
sections.&#13;
5.5   For proper co-ordination of all water related national activities, a&#13;
centralised authority responsible for policy preparation and&#13;
implementation as well as a decentralised approach to water policy&#13;
making and implementation to suit a federal system of government are&#13;
considered and the appropriate institutional arrangement is under&#13;
implementation since 1993 (proclamation No. 41/1993).&#13;
5.6   The establishment of a water resource master Plan for each river basin&#13;
has been in progress to varying degrees. For Omo/Gibe and Baro-Akobo&#13;
river basins, preparations of master plans is underway (Completion&#13;
Target: 1996). Studies have also been initiated for most of the major&#13;
river basins. For Abay and Tekeze basins, consultants teams have been&#13;
selected and works are under progress (Completion Target: 1999). For&#13;
Wabi Shebele baain, preparation of master plan is scheduled for 1996&#13;
(Completion Target: 2000). For Awash basin, the surface water study&#13;
has already been undertaken (Completion Target: 2000). For Rift Valley&#13;
basin, a preliminary survey has been prepared and a study will be&#13;
initiated soon (Completion Target: 2000). For Genale basin, only&#13;
preliminary capacity assessment has been undertaken (Completion Target:&#13;
2000).,&#13;
6.    Technology Development&#13;
6.1   A systematic approach to applied research, aimed at exploring&#13;
alternative options and developing these for practical application, has&#13;
not been sufficiently promoted in the past. Efficient mechanisms for&#13;
the dissemination of replicable technologies are lacking and co-&#13;
coordination and registration of experimental projects as inputs to the&#13;
learning process has not been initiated.&#13;
6.2   For water supply many approaches have been tried out in practice and&#13;
many innovative technology modifications have been put to test. These&#13;
should be pursued with added vigor in the future and new programs should&#13;
be initiated and expanded. Researches are being undertaken on hand&#13;
pumps, solar power and wind mill driven pumps.&#13;
6.3   However, sanitation has not been a priority and therefore knowledge of&#13;
recent developments in technology and approaches remains limited.   The&#13;
concept of the ventilated improved pit latrines is known, but not fully&#13;
understood by technicians and extension workers. There is also a clear&#13;
need to further refine and adalt low-cost and aprocriate sanitation&#13;
technolocv for urban areas. as the use and application of conventional&#13;
water-borne sewerage will be minimal. This can be demonstrated throuch&#13;
the Dlanned "Urban Sanitation Proiect" expected to be financed by UNDP&#13;
in the near future. With local staff, studies have also been conducted&#13;
on sanitation in some of the major urban areas under the Public Works&#13;
Programme, even though it is not yet implemented due to lack of&#13;
financial resources.&#13;
6.4   The relevant policy issues to be considered will be: (i) creating a&#13;
favourable environment for the public sector to fulfill promotional and&#13;
regulatory functions [this is already created]; (ii) building local&#13;
manufacturing capacity, [the new economic reform of 1992]; (iii)&#13;
facilitating the growth of local well/bore hole drilling enterprises,&#13;
(the Water Well Drilling Enterprise is improving its efficiency and&#13;
other public and private enterprises are coming to the market); and (iv)&#13;

7.    Institutional Framework&#13;
7.1   The Ministry formulates policies, strategies and provide guidelines,&#13;
while the Regional Bureaus are implementors of same and their own plans&#13;
The existing institutional arrangement/framework for the sector includes&#13;
the following, and their main duties and responsibilities are indicated&#13;
below:&#13;
The Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR)&#13;
It has powers and duties, inter alia, to determine the condition and&#13;
methods required for the optimum allocation and utilisation of water&#13;
that flows across or lies between more than one regional self-&#13;
governments, among various uses and regions, including transboundary&#13;
water. It also initiates the preparation of master plans for the&#13;
development of valleys, including the undertaking of studies pertaining&#13;
to water tariff and collection of bulk charges for large scale water&#13;
supply schemes, dams and the like. [The powers and duties of the&#13;
Ministry still go further to the extent of controlling the impact of&#13;
natural resources on the environment and preventing water, soil and air&#13;
pollution]. it carries out its functions in the sector through the&#13;
following major/technical departments.&#13;
-     Planning and Projects Departsent&#13;
It prepares the country's water resource policy and strategy;&#13;
coordinates the relevant government offices and various&#13;
Departments of the Ministry to prepare the Federal Water Policy,&#13;
Prepares an integrated short, medium and long-term plans for the&#13;
water sector. Besides, it follows up implementation, evaluates&#13;
and prepares socio-economic studies for vital projects and conduct&#13;
studies on water tariff policy. The Department prepares and&#13;
provides to the Federal Government, Regional Governments and&#13;
investors as, required, detail of projects that were covered by&#13;
the Master Plan Studies.&#13;
-     Basins Development Studies Department&#13;
Studies and prepares the country's water basin master plans,&#13;
identify projects that could be implemented with in basins,&#13;
conduct feasibility studies and realize that the Master Plan&#13;
studies take the nation's water resources, natural resources, land&#13;
and socio-economic features into account.&#13;
-     Trans-boundary Rivers Study Department&#13;
Conduct studies on trans-boundary rivers, realize that the benefit&#13;
from such rivers are secured and in line with the international&#13;
water use principles, national integrity and advantages.&#13;
-     Design Department&#13;
Conducts survey and design of various water works that are to be&#13;
undertaken by the Federal Government; control and follow-up works&#13;
of foreign consultants. The Department monitors and finds out&#13;
remedies for any environmental impact of designed construction&#13;
works associated with prepared designs. It provides technical and&#13;
professional support for water supply ).igation works to&#13;
Regional Administrations.         ,  &gt;  &#13;

REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS&#13;
At a regional level, the Regional Water, Mines and Energy Bureaus are&#13;
responsible for the overall development, management and utilisation of&#13;
water resources:&#13;
The duties and responsibilities of the bureaus, among others, include&#13;
the following:&#13;
to ensure that central government laws, regulations and directives&#13;
issued in relation to the conservation and utilisation of water&#13;
resources are respected in the regions;&#13;
to control the implementation of the country's water resources&#13;
development policies;&#13;
to grant permits to persons engaged in water works construction&#13;
activities, such as dams and other works, in view of utilising the&#13;
water resources of the regions;&#13;
-     to supervise the balanced distribution and utilisation of the&#13;
water resources of the regions for various types of services or&#13;
uses;&#13;
-     plan, study and design rural water supply schemes;&#13;
-     supervise and inspect the activities of.wAt_r service units;&#13;

-     provide technical and maintenance services for the water service&#13;
units and the rural water points; and&#13;
-     promote community participation.&#13;
The Regional governments have the authority to decide on water and&#13;
sewerage tariffs. They also formulate their investment plans within the&#13;
budget ceiling allocated to them by the central government.&#13;
8.    Capacity Building&#13;
8.1   Given Ethiopia's potential resource base, to support overall economic&#13;
and social activity, and the radically new approach of decentralisation,&#13;
new management skills will be required, both for MoWR and the regions.&#13;
In this regard, there is a need to formulate a comprehensive management&#13;
system to increase the capacity to manage, administer, operate and&#13;
maintain the existing systems, as well as to implement new programmes&#13;
and projects. With emerging decentralisation in water supply and&#13;
sanitation activities, the creation of a strong management and planning&#13;
systems at regional levels is absolutely necessary. In brief, the&#13;
pillars for sustainability of water supply and sanitation services is&#13;
capacity building at different levels.&#13;
8.2   There is also a need to upgrade the facilities and equipment,&#13;
particularly those of the Regional bureaus. Clear operational&#13;
procedures and lines of information flow need to be established between&#13;
the central and the regional bureaus. There is also a need to set-up a&#13;
system of standardisation of equipment, management and information flow&#13;
to provide logistic support to the regions. The number of professional&#13;
staff in the different regional bureaus need to be increased and&#13;
upgraded in order for them to handle new technological applications,&#13;
methodologies, as well as to adapt transfer of skills to zonal and water&#13;
supply units. In brief, the capacity building effort will concentrate&#13;
on:&#13;
-     formulation of comprehensive management system,;&#13;
-     formulation of training Droqrammes for senior. medium and lower&#13;
level mannower geared towards programme formulation.&#13;
implementation, monitoring. overation and maintenance. etc.; and&#13;
-     strengthening the institutional capacity through providing&#13;
eauipment. logistics support, spare Parts. workshop. and water&#13;
chemicals.&#13;
8.3   In order to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the&#13;
organisational, financial and technical management of the water supply&#13;
operations in the country, a project has been identified to be financed&#13;
by the World Bank. Other than this IDA's WSDRP, in the 5th cycle&#13;
Country Programme (1995-1996), UNDP has a capacity building component&#13;
for regional as well as central institutions which is now under&#13;
implementation. The output of the programme is expected to build and&#13;
strengthen the institutional capacity as well as develop human resources&#13;
in the sector in order to facilitate the provision of water supply&#13;
servic-e.  These Programmes will helo to develop management capacity of&#13;
the recional administrations to implement Policies, guidelines.  etc.&#13;
9.    Establishment of National Standard&#13;
9.1   With the present commitment to accelerate water supply coverage and to&#13;
bring the economic and social benefits of safe drinking water and&#13;
sanitary facilities, to both the urban and rural populations, more&#13;
resources are needed. To utilise the limited resources effectively&#13;
requires, among other things, that the planning process be guided by&#13;
standards that will assist in evaluating programmes and projects so that&#13;
those selected for implementation can be rationally justified.&#13;

9.2   Theoe standards relate to the quantity and quality of water to be&#13;
supplied for various uses. In the urban areas, domestic consumption per&#13;
capita per day in related to the level of service, ranging from in-house&#13;
connections to public fountains. Taking the existing crude data, the&#13;
standard for project planning, based on population size and level of&#13;
service, are indicated below;&#13;

9.3   With regard to quantity standards, the present standard in&#13;
3S-40 l/c/d for urban contras and 15-25 l/c/d for rural&#13;
water supply schemes. However, it has to be noted that, the&#13;
design parameters for urban centres allow higher values than&#13;
the one indicated above, As far as quality standards are&#13;
concerned, the country has attempted to establish its own&#13;
standard, with the view of achieving WHO standard.&#13;
10.   Cost Recovery and Financing Strategy&#13;
10.1  Cost recovery is of paramount concern throughout the water&#13;
supply and sanitation sector. Because of the policies&#13;
pursued in the past, there has been a tendency to treat&#13;
water as a free commodity for which the people are not&#13;
expected to directly pay. However, changes are being forced&#13;
upon the government in view of the magnitude of the&#13;
investment, operation and maintenance costs of water supply&#13;
serviesm, particularly in urban areas. The lack of clear&#13;
policy toward cost recovery has greatly contributed to the&#13;
financial problema of water supply services. Experience&#13;
shows that, as long as water supply services are dependent&#13;
on central government budget allocations, they can hardly&#13;
operate efficiently. Safe and convenient water supply,&#13;
delivered to the consumer's house, is a highly valued&#13;
consumer good, and ther is no reason why the consumers&#13;
should not pay for it. The financial strateay in urban&#13;
arasa ther-fore, should be desianed to encourao-&#13;
conservation of water rerources and at the  sam  time, it&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 13 of 17&#13;
should be in a position to cover operation and maintenance&#13;
costs. Capital cost recovery should be maximised based on&#13;
the populations ability to pay: the lona term coal being the&#13;
phaging out of government subsidies. Within this framework.&#13;
tariff structure that accomplish these obiectives will be&#13;
introduced.&#13;
10.2  To this effect the government has established basic&#13;
principles and guidelines for pricing and cost recovery for&#13;
urban water supply and sanitation operation (March 1995).&#13;
According to the document the tariff will be signed on&#13;
marginal cost Pricing alproach which takes into account&#13;
economic. social and financial oblectivec of water&#13;
utilities. The tariff increase for Addis Ababa, effective&#13;
in May 1995, has been approved by AAWSA's Board. A formal&#13;
approval for the tariff increases for urban water supply in&#13;
Oromia Regional Administration, including Assela and&#13;
Shashemene towns, will be given by the Oromia Regional&#13;
Council and a notification will be issued accordingly.&#13;
Tariff increases in other towns will be made step-by-step&#13;
after some studies are conducted and approved by the&#13;
respective Regional Administrations. By 1996 Regions will&#13;
finalize a tinme frame for implementation of the tariff&#13;
increase and commence implementation thereafter in the&#13;
remaining towns. The imolementation of tariff adiustment&#13;
will be in phases and the full cost recovery (urban water&#13;
suoolv) may be reached over a oeriod of time depending on&#13;
the objective condition of each region.&#13;
10.3  With respect to rural water supply tariff, there was no&#13;
clear policy. In some areas the users pay for water while&#13;
in others it is free of charge, but actively participate in&#13;
construction and operate and maintain the schemes through&#13;
their water committees. The policy of supplying water free&#13;
of charge, however, proved that the schemes could not be&#13;
sustained. Hence, in order to address this problems and&#13;
ensure a sustainable rural water supply, a national rural&#13;
tariff study is llanned to be launched under the UNDP&#13;
financed 5th Cycle Country Proaramme (1994-99). The study&#13;
is expected to come up with tariff structure, based on&#13;
affordability, which will enable to cover at least the&#13;
operation and maintenance costs of rural water supply&#13;
schemes. The study is expected to commence in the second&#13;
quarter of 1996.&#13;
11.   Roles of the Public and Private Sectors&#13;
11.1  The role of the public sector is to prepare policy&#13;
guidelines and regulations, plans and strategies, provide&#13;
budgetary and technical assistance, monitoring and&#13;
supervision for the overall development of the sector, while&#13;
the role of the private sector is providing consultancy&#13;
services for feasibility studies and design and actively&#13;
participating in construction, drilling and supplying of&#13;
pumps, generators, pipes and fittings, etc. Specifically,&#13;
the private sector can participate in the following areas;&#13;
(a)   As consulting and counselling services:&#13;
-     conduct pre-feasibility and feasibility studies;&#13;
-     prepare designs and tender documents;&#13;
-     construction supervision; and&#13;
-     studies on institutional capacity building,&#13;
tariff, etc.&#13;

(b)   As a contractor:&#13;
-     water well drilling;&#13;
-     construct new water supply schemes; and&#13;
-     rehabilitate and maintain existing schemes.&#13;
(C)   As a provider of sanitation services&#13;
-     solid waste disposal; and&#13;
-     sewerage systems services.&#13;
11.2  The government will assess the conditions and leaal&#13;
framework for the Participation of vrivate sector in the&#13;
area of water supplv activities.  Accordingly. urivate&#13;
sector Participation in managina. overating and maintainina&#13;
water suuolv services. particularlv in urban areas. will be&#13;
considered in order to create comoetition and control&#13;
monomol . Consumers participation in controlling monopoly&#13;
will also be encouraged. In order to satisfy the fast&#13;
growing demand of the Regions, the involvement of the public&#13;
sector will continue until the private sector fully takes&#13;
over these activities.&#13;
12.   Performance Incentives and Accountability&#13;
12.1 The inadequacies in operation, maintenance and&#13;
monitoring, both in the urban and rural water services&#13;
is partly a manifestation of poor management, lack of&#13;
performance incentives and accountability. There is a&#13;
near depletion of professional manpower in the sector.&#13;
There is no incentive, whatsoever, as a result morale&#13;
and motivation of staff is low. Coupled with normal&#13;
aging of facilities, this situation has resulted in&#13;
many of the water supply systems, mostly in rural&#13;
areas, being non-operational. Hence, there is a need&#13;
to formulate incentive policies (such as bonuses,&#13;
better payment, long leave, training opportunities,&#13;
etc.) with clearly defined accountability if the water&#13;
services are going to be properly managed, operated&#13;
and maintained. Oroanizational study under the IDA's&#13;
WSDRP will look into this issue and make&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
13.   Efficiency Management&#13;
13.1 Master plan study preparations are under way in some&#13;
of the river basins aiming at optimum utilisation and&#13;
allocation of different users within a framework of&#13;
integrated development approach of water resources. A&#13;
master plan study for water supply financed by the&#13;
Dutch Government is also expected to start by mid-&#13;
1996. However, the maximum utilisation and efficient&#13;
management of these resources is very complex by&#13;
nature and will require not only a coordinated&#13;
planning among the different users, but a sound&#13;
institutional framework that will allow to formulate&#13;
policies, mechanism for coordinated planning, cost&#13;
recovery, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
13.2 In this regard, measures that will help for the&#13;
efficient manaaement will be introduced.based on the&#13;
outcome of the study. Thus,&#13;
-     legal measures for the control and balanced use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 15 of 17&#13;
of water resource will be introduced;&#13;
-     demand-spreadina technigues aimed at relieving&#13;
peak demand pressure will be introduced; and&#13;
-     leoal provisions for the protection of water&#13;
supplv sources and enforcement of rules on use&#13;
and conservation of water will be introduced by&#13;
giving relevant authorities responsibility in&#13;
water resource system planning, simulation and&#13;
optimisation.&#13;
13.3 Furthermore, throuah the institutional capacity&#13;
buildino comoonent of the World Bank Project (Water&#13;
SuOolV Development and Rehabilitation} assistance will&#13;
be provided to improve olerational efficiency of water&#13;
supolv and sewerace utilities in each region.&#13;
Trainina will be Provided to the regions' water supplv&#13;
managers to improve their manaaement efficiency.&#13;
14.   Participation of Stakeholder&#13;
14.1 The main participants in the sector are the&#13;
government, bilateral and multilateral organisations,&#13;
international financial institutions, NGOs and the&#13;
consumers (communities). The government's main role&#13;
is formulating sector policies, planning and&#13;
coordination, budget allocation and capacity building,&#13;
while the role of the donors is mainly contributing&#13;
funds for construction, rehabilitation and, to a&#13;
certain deogree, for capacity building and operation&#13;
and maintenance. The rural communities are also&#13;
participating by contributing funds, labour for&#13;
construction, but their main contribution is operating&#13;
and maintaining the schemes through their water&#13;
committees.&#13;
14.2  In the future, the government will continue its role&#13;
as promoter, facilitator and coordinator. The rural&#13;
water supplv 2ilot Proiect. one of the components of&#13;
WSDRP. will create a forum for rural water supolv&#13;
activities. The Bank's Social Rehabilitation Fund&#13;
Proiect, which is under preparation, includes&#13;
community basgd construction approach. The&#13;
oroanizational study of WSDRP will make&#13;
recommendations as to how to improve communication&#13;
with stakeholders in decision making.&#13;
15.   Enforcement of Regulations and Monitoring&#13;
15.1 To improve the water supply and sanitation sector&#13;
management, operation and maintenance, effective legal&#13;
and regulatory framework that will allow enforcement&#13;
of regulation need to be created. The existing&#13;
regulatory and monitoring framework rests within the&#13;
MoWR. The regions are also responsible for regulating&#13;
and monitoring, within their respective area, and&#13;
supposed to report to the central government.&#13;
15.2 Policies, guidelines and directives so far developed&#13;
for the enforcement of regulations include:&#13;
-     Water Resource Utilisation Proclamation&#13;
(92/1994).  This is the            Ily instituted&#13;
" s,&#13;

instrument for the development, management and&#13;
utilisation of the       water resource of the&#13;
country;&#13;
-     guidelines for the establishing of water&#13;
committees which is meant to involve communities&#13;
in all aspects of water supply activities;&#13;
-     directives issued with respect to drilling for&#13;
organisations involved in drilling, construction&#13;
and rehabilitation of boreholes and related&#13;
works;&#13;
-     Basic Principles and Guidelines for Urban Water&#13;
Tariff Study has been recently approved by the&#13;
government. The regions will be implementors of&#13;
the policy; and&#13;
-     a draft irrigation policy has been prepared, but&#13;
it has not been finalised. This policy requires&#13;
to be finalised and its implementation should&#13;
follow.&#13;
16.   Investment Planning&#13;
16.1  Meeting targets for providing communities with safe&#13;
water and the formulation of a step-by-step approach&#13;
to achieve this aim is considered a priority.&#13;
Specific and detailed plans will be adopted on water&#13;
supply services suited to specific conditions focusing&#13;
on the interests of the most disadvantaged&#13;
communities. According to the plan of action for the&#13;
period 1993-1999 programme, prepared in August 1992,&#13;
national population coverage of 35% for rural and 95%&#13;
for urban water supply and 12% and 70% rural and&#13;
urban sanitation respectively will be achieved by the&#13;
end of the decade.&#13;
16.2  To improve the existing water supply service level and&#13;
coverage, the techniques of investment planning need&#13;
to be reviewed taking into account the new structural&#13;
set-up of the country as well as the New Economic&#13;
Policy. The existing investment planning processes&#13;
are composed of four main components:&#13;
-     identification of projects and programmes;&#13;
-     project determination, selection and funding;&#13;
-     determination of financial resources; and&#13;
-     budgeting and programming.&#13;
16.3  The broad investment planning process in the sector&#13;
begins with development strategy of the country&#13;
focusing on exploration, survey, evaluation of water&#13;
resources, and analysis of water use demand. Within&#13;
the framework of the sector objectives and priorities,&#13;
funds for projects are derived from the following&#13;
sources:&#13;
-     external loans and grants;&#13;
-     government budget;&#13;
-     NGOs; and&#13;
-     community contribution.&#13;
16.4  Apart from the MoWR the investment planning involves&#13;
the following Ministries/agencies:&#13;
-     the Ministry of Economic Development and&#13;
Cooperation (MEDaC) (for a_pcasal and approval&#13;

of plan budgets);&#13;
-     the Ministry of Finance (for the indication of&#13;
overall financial resources); and&#13;
-     the Regional Bureaus prepare budgets and plan&#13;
for projects and programmes within their&#13;
respective area.&#13;
16.5 The major selection criteria for water supply&#13;
projects/programmes are the following:&#13;
-     number of beneficiaries;&#13;
-     strong development potential in respect to its&#13;
administrative functions;&#13;
production, distribution and commercial&#13;
activities,;&#13;
-     consideration of equity among regions; and&#13;
-     lack of major assistance from other donors or&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
17.   Donor Coordination&#13;
17.1  The existing coordination among the many government&#13;
agencies, bilateral, multilateral and NGO's operating&#13;
in the water supply and sanitation sector is not up to&#13;
the desired level. This is a reflection of the past&#13;
tendency to work in isolation. Their policies,&#13;
objectives and strategies need to be focused and&#13;
coordinated to the better performance of the sector.&#13;
In this regards, the MoWR, which is responsible to&#13;
register and approve donor projects and programmes,&#13;
particularly NGOs, need to take further steps to&#13;
coordinate overall activities. Such an approach will&#13;
help to standardise the large number of types and&#13;
models of imported and donated equipment. It will&#13;
also avoid duplication of inputs and encourage thrust&#13;
in support of the national programme. Hence, as a&#13;
policy development, there is a need to create a strong&#13;
mechanism of policy coordination at the Ministry&#13;
level, to work closely with all government agencies,&#13;
donors and the Regional Administrative Offices. Such&#13;
an approach will not only facilitate smooth&#13;
implementation of programmes and projects funded by&#13;
donors, but will also help for equitable distribution&#13;
of foreign assistance to the different regions.&#13;
17.2 Sector assistance coordination initiation meetina.&#13;
inviting donors and NGOs. would be oraanised by the&#13;
MoWR. in order to exchanae information on assistance&#13;
activities and to work on the modalities of future&#13;
coordination mecbanism.  The agenda for this initial&#13;
meeting will be presentation of brief reports by the&#13;
participants on their activities, participants'&#13;
interest in coordination, issues to be discussed in&#13;
the future forum, modalities of future forum (timing,&#13;
venue, financing, secretariat, budget &amp; assistance),&#13;
etc.&#13;

WATER SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT AND REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF ADDIS ABABA WATER AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY&#13;
(AWSA)&#13;
AWSA will be the executing agency for the AWSA sub-components of the&#13;
Project: technical assistance for implementation of Organizational Management Change&#13;
and Management Information System&#13;
Establishment. AWSA's origin goes back to the Water Supply Administration,&#13;
the predecessor of AWSA, which was created in 1964 under the Municipality of Addis&#13;
Ababa. AWSA took over the Water Supply Administration by Order No. 68 in 1971, as&#13;
an autonomous public authority. AWSA did not have any reporting obligation to higher&#13;
authorities of the sector, including the Water Resource Commission.&#13;
AWSA's legal environment is being modified since the Regional Administrations&#13;
were established under the Transitional Government of Ethiopia in 1993. The newly&#13;
established Region 14 Administration has replaced the Addis Ababa municipality&#13;
government. Region 14 Administtation has officially proclaimed the re-establishment of&#13;
AWSA to redefine AWSA's power and duties. AWSA's major responsibilities to be&#13;
stipulated in the forthcoming proclamation are to:&#13;
(a)   supply adequate safe water for household consumption and other domestic&#13;
uses, sanitation of Sstreets and disposal of sewage, protection against fire&#13;
and other forms of combustion, industrial and commercial uses, and public&#13;
parks and similar services;&#13;
(b)   provide waste water and sludge disposal services; and&#13;
(c)   maintain water service facilities, safeguard surface and underground water&#13;
from undue exploitation and prevent its contamination.&#13;
AWSA is now under the supervision of a new Board of Directors. The current&#13;
members of the Board of Directors include: the Chairman of Region 14 Administration&#13;
(Chairman of the Board), an official from the Prime Minister's Office, another three&#13;
officials from Region 14 Administration, two officials from Oromia Regional&#13;
Administration, the General Manager of AWSA, a vice minister from MWUD and an&#13;
official from Ministry of Finance. The decision-making by the Board of Directors is still&#13;
slow since the members of the Board have been highly involved in other activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Organization: Under the Board of Directors, the General Manager is the chief&#13;
executive of the organization. There are four main departments; Technical Services,&#13;
Operations, Finance and Administration.  It also has six service units; Planning,&#13;
Programming and Budget, Organization &amp; Methods and Manpower Development,&#13;
Computer Information Services, Internal Audit, Public Relation and Legal Services.&#13;
AWSA has its head office in downtown Addis Ababa, and five branch and one sub-&#13;
branch offices to support field operations throughout the Authority's serving area. The&#13;
sub-branch office is located in Akaki, where growing industries and population are&#13;
expected. The current organizational structure is as shown below.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
Human Resources: Although AWSA has relatively well qualified personnel,&#13;
compared to other sector institutions, there is an imbalance between the required skills&#13;
and available human resources. As of March 1994, AWSA's total number of permanent&#13;
employees was 1,371, and in addition, 108 are working on contract bases. Out of 1,371&#13;
permanent employees, four percent are above BA/B.Sc. level, some thirty percent are&#13;
above grade 12. The details of the numbers of employees by department and unit and&#13;
their educational/professional level are presented in Attachment 1.&#13;
Mainstream Service Process: AWSA's mainline business process in providing&#13;
water services to customers begins by deploying water main pipes. From there, the&#13;
process involves connecting water from main pipes to customers and performing cyclical&#13;
billing and collection, and ends by disconnecting pipes. AWSA's departments and&#13;
service units are taking part in performing the whole process. Once the construction of&#13;
main pipes is completed by the Technical Department, branch offices of the Operation&#13;
Department become primarily responsible for connecting and disconnecting water to&#13;
customers. For continuing customers, branch offices, the Finance Department and&#13;
Computer Information Services (CIS) jointly perform their work in billing and collection&#13;
in a two-month cycle. For the sewerage service, there is no billing and collection cycle&#13;
because currently no fees are required for sewerage usage. The Technical Department is&#13;
in charge of the construction and maintenance of necessary pumps, water reservoirs and&#13;
treatment plants to sustain infrastructure for the mainline customer services.&#13;
Service Capacity; The present water production is about 125,000 m3/day. The&#13;
number of water connections (including public taps) is about 130,000, of which about&#13;
900 are major customers. It is estimated that unaccounted-for-water amounts to more&#13;
than 30% of water production and about two-thirds of that is attributed to physical losses&#13;
in the system. Efforts are under way to reduce the losses with gradual rehabilitation of&#13;
the system. At present, AWSA has a small sewerage network system serving only a&#13;
limited part of the city's center. There are only about 1,300 connections to the sewerage&#13;
system because the initial sewerage connection fees are very high and the public is&#13;
unaware of the sewerage system. As a result, only about 10% of the sewerage treatment&#13;
capacity is being used. Because of the low sewerage flows, the sewers must occasionally&#13;
be flushed to avoid clogging. Instead of connecting to the sewerage system, many&#13;
residents use septic tanks or pit latrines, and AWSA is responsible for providing them&#13;
with tank emptying services.&#13;
Capacity Development Plansi In order to meet the growing demand for water in&#13;
Addis Ababa, AWSA has been implementing and preparing a number of projects. Under&#13;
the on-going Second Addis Ababa Urban Development Project, expansion of water&#13;
supply system in Akaki has been being undertaken, including construction of gravity&#13;
transmission main with a bulk meter, storage reservoir, distribution network and auxiliary&#13;
buildings. The project cost is estimated at US$4.5 million. An emergency interim project&#13;
to increase the water supply to Addis Ababa in a short term will be undertaken shortly.&#13;
The project will consist of construction of Dire Dam (US$24 million) and drilling of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
ground water in Akaki (US$27 million) and is to be financed by TGE. For the waste&#13;
water management, AWSA will soon initiate a first phase of a waste water management&#13;
project. The project will consist of increase of house connection, extension of sewers,&#13;
construction of wastewater treatment plants, civil works and procurement of tankers for&#13;
sludge collection, and sludge treatment and disposal schemes and plant. The project cost&#13;
is estimated at some US$85 million and is to be financed by EU and TGE. The Addis&#13;
Ababa Water Supply Stage IIIA Project (AWSIIIP) is being designed to significantly&#13;
expand the water supply capacity to Addis Ababa. The IIIA Project includes: i) the&#13;
construction of Gerbi dam and Sibilu dam; ii) the establishment and augmentation of&#13;
transmission lines and distribution network; and iii) the abstraction of ground water from&#13;
Akaki area. The total capital cost of the project is estimated at US$450 million.&#13;
Institutional Capacity: AWSA's overall institutional capacity, in the areas of&#13;
operational fixed assets, organizational structure, management and labor, manual&#13;
procedures, human resource development and computer information systems, has to be&#13;
improved in order to meet growing customers' demand, improve quality of services and&#13;
carry out future large-scale projects. As for underinvestment in operational fixed assets,&#13;
the malfunctioning water meters and very old water pipes , which cause an extremely&#13;
high level of unaccounted-for-water, has to be replaced. An acute shortage of operational&#13;
vehicles and computer terminals of branch offices have to be alleviated. In terms of&#13;
organizational structure, AWSA's highly centralized organizational structure has to be&#13;
restructured because the divisions performing the mainline business process do not&#13;
receive high priority and workers and middle managers are unable to respond to customer&#13;
needs and expectations in timely manner due to lack of appropriate authority. The&#13;
number of organizational layers between management at the top and workers at the&#13;
bottom has to be reduced to expedite decision-making. Certain responsibilities, which are&#13;
currently allocated to inappropriate units, should be reassigned to appropriate units.&#13;
Inadequate document management causes significant fluctuation of productivity&#13;
accompanied by personnel changes and difficulty in converting manually prepared data&#13;
into computer systems databases. AWSA has to develop better human resources&#13;
planning and management system. There is significant imbalance between the required&#13;
skills and the existing skills of the employees. Training programs are not necessarily&#13;
available for all the professional streams .  The lack of performance indicators,&#13;
transparent promotion criteria and incentive schemes is affecting morale of the work&#13;
force.&#13;
MIS Despite continuing efforts by Computer Information Service (CIS)&#13;
personnel to improve computing capacity of the mainframe computer system, AWSA's&#13;
computer systems have been extremely unpopular among user departments due to the&#13;
persistent problems in the functions of application software and the limited systems&#13;
development capacity. A for t4e functions of the application software, due to poor&#13;
communication between CIS and the end-users, the functions of application software is&#13;
unsatisfactory to the users, created distrust of computer system outputs among users. The&#13;
knowledge of functions of applicAtion software has been kept within CIS and no manuals&#13;
or training programs has been developed to make end-users understand the application&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
functions. Primary examples are delays in billing and collection and closing of AWSA's&#13;
accounts. In terms of the limited system development capacity, an appropriate system&#13;
maintenance is not possible since there is no documentation on the existing application&#13;
software for systems analysts or programmers to support their systems maintenance and&#13;
there is not enough communication between the systems analysts and software&#13;
programmers.&#13;
For personal computers LAN, AWSA's recently installed eight personal&#13;
computers have been underutilized. Some of them are occasionally used for computer&#13;
games only. There is no incentives for end-users to use them for business purposes&#13;
because of a lack of user training and very limited software support. Now CIS has&#13;
developed an ambitious plan to build a LAN among these PCs and the mainframe, along&#13;
with the introduction of a fourtht generation language to its application systems&#13;
development. Although CIS is willing to learn new technologies, it is not yet fully&#13;
confident of operating decentralized systems and employing computer network&#13;
technology, which is not yet common in Ethiopia.&#13;
AWSA Financial Performance: AWSA is financially defunct. AWSA has not&#13;
been able to cover its operations and maintenance expenses mainly due to the low water&#13;
tariff (ETBO.5 per cubic meter), which has not been revised for 43 years. AWSA's&#13;
revenues were stagnating at around ETB1 7 million between FY88/89 and FY90/91 due to&#13;
the unrevised tariffs and lack of significant capacity improvement of water supply. Its&#13;
operating expenses increased from ETB25 million in FY88/89 to ETB32 million in&#13;
FY90/91, which resulted in increasing net deficits for the three year period from ETB8.4&#13;
million in FY88/89 to ETB14.2 million in FY90/91. Its accumulated deficit amounted to&#13;
ETB45 millon at the end of FY90/91. With the devaluation of Ethiopian Birr in 1992&#13;
from ETB 2.07/US$ to ETB5.OO/US$, AWSA's operating and maintenance expenses,&#13;
such as fuel and chemicals, are expected to have increased significantly and AWSA's&#13;
financial performance should have deteriorated further.&#13;
Its capital structure is unsound: its operations and maintenance activities and&#13;
capital investments are financed by contributions from the government, grants from&#13;
donors and concessional long-term loans. AWSA has no debt service capability and has&#13;
been subsidized by the government in meeting its debts service obligations. Without&#13;
contributions and grants, AWSA incurred capital deficit of ETB28 million at the end of&#13;
FY90/91. The outstanding balance of long-term loans at end-FY90/91 was some 9 times&#13;
of the state capital. More than sixty percent of the creditors' balance at end-FY90/9 1 was&#13;
interest  charges   payable   which   AWSA   owes  to  the   government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
AWSA's cash position is also precarious.  Due to inefficient collection, it&#13;
accunulated high outstanding balance of account receivable and has not met payment&#13;
obligations. Its outstanding balance of account receivable at end-FY90/91 was ETB12&#13;
million , or over 8 months equivalent of the water sales related revenues. Its financial&#13;
charges on loans have been covered by the government on behalf of AWSA. AWSA' s&#13;
audited financial statements between FY1988/89 and FY1993/94 are available in the&#13;
project file.&#13;

ETHIOPIA&#13;
WATER SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT AND REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ACTIVITIES OF DONORS&#13;
A number of donors and NGOs are active in the water supply and sanitation sector&#13;
in Ethiopia. Below is a brief description of the activities of the major donors:&#13;
African Development Bank: ADB, through its soft-loan arm, the African&#13;
Development Fund (ADF), is a major donor to the urban water supply sector. Its&#13;
objectives are to assist in the formulation of sectoral policies, priorities and objectives, to&#13;
provide necessary funding and to attract financial resources from other sources required&#13;
for sector expansion. ADF has provided loans for eleven urban water supplies and for&#13;
sewerage in Addis Ababa, in addition to grants for studies.&#13;
Belgian Survival Fund: The Fund is providing grant finds for a major&#13;
sanitation/water supply program being implemented by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in&#13;
various parts of the country. The program is being executed by IFAD in conjunction with&#13;
UNICEF, WHO and UNDP.&#13;
Canadian International Development Agency: CIDA has provided support to&#13;
the sector since 1977, concentrating its assistance in the southern part of the country&#13;
through the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Programme. This project was initially&#13;
oriented towards construction of new rural water supply schemes; over the years the focus&#13;
has changed to capacity building, with particular emphasis on operation and maintenance.&#13;
European Union: The EU has provided grant funding through the European&#13;
Development Fund for a water supply program in the west and northwest, covering&#13;
rehabilitation, development of rural water supplies, and strengthening regional capacity&#13;
(with a major emphasis on sustainability). The EU also funded construction materials and&#13;
technical assistance for the Addis Ababa Water Supply Project, Stage ILA, which involved&#13;
the expansion of treatment plants, transmission lines, pumping stations and reservoirs. EU&#13;
plans to finance Water Improvement Project in Addis Ababa.&#13;
Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA):  In 1994, after a&#13;
delay of several years due to lack of security in the project area, FINNIDA began&#13;
implementing a four-year, US$6 million Rural Water Supply Program in Amhara Region.&#13;
Using simple technology and a participatory approach, the program focuses on spring&#13;
protection and hand dug wells, with some irrigation and sanitation, as well as community&#13;
education activities and preparation of watershed management plans.  Finland also&#13;
supports a number of Finnish church NGOs with small water projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Germany: Germany has assisted rural water supplies through GTZ, and urban&#13;
supplies through KfW, with the major focus in rural areas. Since 1979, GTZ has&#13;
supported a major training program, largely at the Arba Minch Water Technology Institute&#13;
(AMWTI). GTZ is also supporting the Central Region Rural Water Supply Programme&#13;
which concentrates on rehabilitating existing supplies and strengthening operation and&#13;
maintenance. KfW has assisted the urban water supply sector since the mid- 1970s. It is&#13;
currently preparing a project to fund rehabilitation of eight urban water supplies.&#13;
Italy: Italy has concentrated its assistance on the implementation of a rural water&#13;
supply construction program in the Central Region, together with investments in&#13;
operations and maintenance. It has also provided a major loan for the Addis Ababa Water&#13;
Supply Stage IIB.&#13;
Japan: Japan helped establish the Water Well Drilling Agency (WWDA) in the&#13;
early 1970s, with a loan from OECF. Since then, through the Japanese International&#13;
Cooperation Agency (JICA), it has provided technical assistance to WWDA, WSSA, and&#13;
AAWSA. JICA is currently undertaking a feasibility study of potential groundwater&#13;
resources in eleven towns; the study will include formulation of a groundwater&#13;
development plan and a maintenance plan for the water supply systems.&#13;
The Netherlands: The Netherlands intend to provide assistance for preparation of&#13;
a national water resource master plan; establishment of environmental database and&#13;
monitoring system; and human resource development.&#13;
Swedish International Development Authority: SIDA has provided support&#13;
to the sector since 1976, concentrating mainly on the Rural Water Supply Programme in&#13;
Eastern Region.  Through construction and rehabilitation, the Programme aims to&#13;
strengthen and develop the capacity of the Water Resource Commission to plan,&#13;
implement, maintain and operate the water supply system. SIDA has provided technical&#13;
assistance and equipment to AMWTI, as well as funding for research and development&#13;
programs, and has in addition contributed to the sector through support to NGOs.&#13;
United Nations Capital Development Fund: UNCDF has provided technical&#13;
assistance and water supply projects to the Central Region, as well as equipment to&#13;
AMWTI. It is currently preparing a project in Amhara Region which will include a&#13;
comnmnity development fund to finance sub-projects, including water supply projects.&#13;
United Nations Development Programme: UNDP has provided support to&#13;
AMWTI by funding lecturers, consultants, training and equipment. In conjunction with&#13;
the World Bank, UNDP assisted WSSA to strengthen its management capacity and&#13;
subsequent decentralization. UNDP was also involved in the execution of an Italian-&#13;
funded program which provided water supplies around Jijiga during 1986-90.&#13;
United Nations Children's Fund: UNICEF has assisted the sector since 1975&#13;
and is a key donor for rural water supply. Initially involved solely in drilling wells,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

activities expanded into developing shallow wells, spring protection, laying distribution&#13;
systems and rehabilitation of defunct schemes; since the late 1980s, simpler and lower-cost&#13;
technologies have been introduced in selected areas. The current UNICEF program&#13;
(1994-99) is a nationwide water and sanitation program to assist the Government in&#13;
fiormulting appropriate sector policies and guidelines, and their dissemination and&#13;
implementation by the regions.&#13;
World Health Organization: WHO's main assistance to the sector has been&#13;
institutional support for community water supply and sanitation programs under the MoH.&#13;

PROJECT&#13;
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS&#13;
Methodology&#13;
Cost/benefit analysis was carried out for the physical investments and for the&#13;
capacity building component which will have a direct impact on the efficiency of the water&#13;
supply operations. The economic rate of return was calculated by estimating the net&#13;
benefits from the project. All costs and benefits are expressed in constant prices (base =&#13;
December 1994) and include physical contingencies. The prices used in the analysis are&#13;
net of duties and taxes. The estimated economic rate of return (ERR) of the physical&#13;
investments of the project (including part of the capacity building, see explanation below)&#13;
is 18.4 percent (see Table 1). The net present value of this component at a 12 percent&#13;
discount rate is US$10.6 million. The benefit/cost ratio of this component is 1.27. The&#13;
following describes the assumptions and estimations made. 1&#13;
Project Beneficiaries and Demand Projection&#13;
The beneficiaries of the rehabilitation works and capacity building components will&#13;
be about 550,000 people who live in the 25 towns and about 8.2 million people who live&#13;
in other towns serviced by the Regional Governments in which rehabilitation works will be&#13;
carried out, maintenance equipment and capacity building will be provided. Demand for&#13;
water was projected taking into account an average consumption of 17 liters per capita&#13;
per day (Ipd) and an annual population growth of 3 percent.  Current average&#13;
consumption is approximately 7 lpd. Production is assumed to grow gradually, until&#13;
capacity of most systems is reached in the year 2005.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
Benefits from Increased Water Use and from Replaced Sources: The benefits&#13;
from the rehabilitation component of the project arise from the incremental quantity of&#13;
water supplied by the project. This incremental water could be used by the beneficiaries of&#13;
the project to replace previously used sources, e.g., water from vendors, and to increase&#13;
water consumption; we have not measured however, the benefits from water which&#13;
replaces water sold by vendors. But if we would add benefits from replacing vendors,&#13;
total benefits would be larger since from a survey carried out under a study undertaken&#13;
Shadow prices and exchange rates were not estimated since Ethiopia is undergoing a series of&#13;
macro-economics reforms which has reduced distortions. The exchange rate used is US$ = Birr&#13;
6.25.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

byt WSSA  and DEVECON2  and from  information provided by the Regional&#13;
Governments, consumers are paying from 5 ETB to 25 Birr per cubic meter of water. To&#13;
calculate the benefits from the increase in water consumption, we have estimated the&#13;
increase in revenues as a result of the project. This is a conservative estimate since these&#13;
revenues constitute a lower bound of the consumers' surplus. Using a tariff of ETB 2.5&#13;
and the projected consumption per capita, we have calculated the revenue streams with&#13;
and without project. This is what we call "private benefits" in Table 1. The NPV - of the&#13;
revenue streams without project is US$165.5 million and the one with project is US$196.9&#13;
million; therefore the incremental private benefit due to the project is US$31.5 million.&#13;
Health Benefits: Estimating project benefits taking into account water which&#13;
replaces previously used sources and increases consumption only captures private benefits&#13;
and does not take into account public health improvements. Most consumers' willingness&#13;
to pay for water may not include a willingness to pay for water due to health reasons since&#13;
most consumers might not filly take into account the relationship between clean water and&#13;
its effect on their health. Therefore, we have made a calculation of health benefits. The&#13;
estimate of health benefits includes savings from money spent on treatment of sickness and&#13;
lost income. To calculate the savings from money spent on treatment of water-borne&#13;
disease by age, average days of restricted activity and average spent on treatment of&#13;
disease.3 Lost income due to water-borne disease was calculated based on the number of&#13;
days of restricted activity for the economic active population, multiplied by the average&#13;
income per capita, assuming that 80 percent of their income is lost due to restricted&#13;
activity. In the case of the younger population and older population, since their&#13;
participation in income generation activities is smaller, only 20% of their per capita income&#13;
is supposed to be lost. This assumption is feasible given that adults might have to limit&#13;
their income generating activities to take care of sick children. The population of these&#13;
towns consequently lose about US$4 per capita per year due to water-borne diseases.&#13;
However, to avoid duplications and be on the conservative side, we have only included 50&#13;
percent of the estimated health benefits, namely, US$2 per capita. The present value of&#13;
the savings on health costs is estimated at US$18.0 million. This amount is calculated&#13;
finding the difference between the health costs with and without the Project. (see Table 1).&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
Project Costs and Least Cost Solution: Project costs include both investment&#13;
and recurrent costs. To carry out the economic analysis, investment costs were calculated&#13;
for the rehabilitation of the water supply facilities of the 25 towns which total US$11.4&#13;
million (net of duties and taxes, but including physical contingencies), or 23 percent of&#13;

total investment. The capacity building components, including studies, training, technical&#13;
assistance and institutional support (equipment and buildings), have also been included in&#13;
the project costs because they will have a positive impact on the supply of water. The&#13;
capacity building and institutional support activities which are aimed at the 25 project&#13;
towns have been included in flll amount, while the ones directed to regions have been&#13;
apportioned according to the number of towns under the project relative to the total&#13;
number of towns in the regions. These capacity building components total about US$13.3&#13;
million, bringing the total costs to US$ 24.7. Recurrent costs are estimated at about&#13;
US$2.9 million per year for the 25 towns and Regional Governments, increasing with the&#13;
increase in output.  All costs are calculated taldng into account the least cost of&#13;
rehabilitation and O&amp;M, including physical contingencies. The NPV of the costs (both&#13;
investment and O&amp;M) due to the Project is US$38.8 million&#13;

            Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Water Supply
            Development and Rehabilitation Project are to ensure the
            long-term viability of water supply and sanitation
            operations in line with the Government's
            regionalization policies and, in the long run, improve the
            health and productivity of the population. The objectives
            will be met by providing assistance for: 1) capacity
            building of the Regional Governments and water supply and
            agencies for management of urban water supply and sanitation
            schemes and rural water supply operations; 2) formulation of
            policies to ensure long-term financial and managerial
            viability of water supply operations, establishment of
            regulatory arrangements and sound investment planning by the
            Regional Governments and water supply agencies; and 3)
            short- and medium-term physical rehabilitation, augmentation
            and establishment of urban water supply and sanitation
            schemes in war-affected and the most deficient regions. The
            project will consist of the following components: 1)
            institutional capacity building, which includes water supply
            sector capacity building and rural water supply pilot
            scheme. This component will provide studies, technical
            assistance, training, equipment, service rigs, mobile
            workshops, vehicles and the construction of pilot schemes;
            2) feasibility and engineering which will consist of water
            and sanitation scheme feasibility, engineering designs and
            building works designs; and 3) physical works comprising
            water and sanitation scheme rehabiliation as well as
            building works.
