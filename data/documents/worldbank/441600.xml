Why Performance Contracts for&#13;
State-Owned Enterprises Haven't Worked&#13;
Marn' Sh/vid'      When privatization is not feasible or palatable, some developing country governments seek to&#13;
improve the performance of state enterprises by negotiating performance contracts with their&#13;
managers. Many of these contracts have been put in place with World Bank assistance. Research&#13;
shows that they rarely work. This Note summarizes the rationale for performance contracts and&#13;
explores the reasons why they haven't worked. It concludes that since a well-designed and -enforced&#13;
performance contract can be as politically costly as a well-designed privatization, performance&#13;
contracts are not likely to be successful in countries that lack the political will to privatize.&#13;

            Why performance contracts for state-owned
            enterprises haven't worked
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            When privatization is not feasible or
            palatable, developing country governments seeking to improve
            the performance of state enterprises are often negotiating
            performance contracts with their managers. Many of these
            contracts have been put in place with World Bank assistance.
            Research shows that they rarely work. The author summarizes
            the rationale for performance contracts and the evidence
            against them and explores the reasons why they haven't
            worked. She concludes that since a well-designed and
            carefully enforced performance contract can be as
            politically costly as a well-designed privatization,
            performance contracts are not likely to be successful in
            countries that lack the political will to privatize.
