        The Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) was initiated in the East Asia &amp; the Pacific (EAP) region in 2006 to generate and disseminate economic evidence on&#13;
        sanitation. However, in the studies to date, economic benefits of reducing the pollution of water resources have not been fully evaluated in monetary terms due to&#13;
        methodological difficulties in valuing non-market impacts, the paucity of underlying data sets, and the difficulties inherent in attributing observed impacts to poor&#13;
        sanitation.&#13;

 Currently, the cost of water treatment using surface water&#13;

 costs of using polluted surface water are higher than those                                that, over time, water suppliers will rely less on groundwa-&#13;

 A second impact of improved water quality is that fish                                     be found, such as pumping from the Saguling reservoir or&#13;

 the Citarum River is more accurate. In recent years, the&#13;
 volume of farmed fish has reduced by 5,000 metric tons                                     Environment. In future years, a reduction in untreated&#13;

 rioration of overall water quality flowing into the Saguling                               into rivers will lead to a slower rate of sedimentation in the&#13;
 reservoir (leading to lower DO levels) and overuse of fish                                 Citarum River. Less sediment means that less regular dredg-&#13;

      Based on interviews and data from the Fisheries Office.&#13;
 15&#13;
      During cooler weather spells, the change in water currents brings to the surface deoxygenated water caused by overuse of fish feed. This, in turn, leads to suffocation&#13;
      of the fish, causing mass fish kills, which are often reported in the local press.&#13;
 16&#13;
      Land subsidence is caused mainly by extracting water from deep aquifers, which are insufficiently replenished in the wet season. This phenomenon is prevalent where&#13;
      many industries, big malls, housing estates, and hotels extract excessive deep groundwater. Outside these areas, the groundwater basin still has potential to provide&#13;
      extra deep groundwater.&#13;
 17&#13;
      This is an assumption, but it is likely as the problem becomes more serious and politicized, and also, with falling groundwater levels, it becomes more expensive to&#13;
      extract.&#13;

A second major potential environmental benefit is the im-                                   Reuse. The costs of wastewater reuse are estimated in sce-&#13;

practices have improved. Hence, with significantly improved                                 reuse, recycle) prevents waste from being deposed in land-&#13;
river water quality, the price of land could increase for both                              fills, which results in averted landfill costs and savings, typi-&#13;

Currently, agricultural land in the vicinity of Bandung aver-&#13;

to account for 50% of the differential of Rp606,000 per                                         â&#128;¢ Disease rates and mortality were reduced to half the&#13;

Rp303,000 is multiplied by an estimate for the amount of                                            stead of 20 years.&#13;

     Estimated using 40 L of sediment per person per year, 10 million people in Bandung basin, of which 50% are not connected to proper sludge processing.&#13;
19&#13;
     The cost of river dredging is Rp18,880 (US$2) per cubic meter. However, the cost of dredging the Saguling reservoir will be much more because it comes from deeper&#13;
     parts; hence, the costs estimated are conservative. The cost of disposal for a distance of 1 kilometer is assumed to double the dredging cost, hence an all-inclusive cost&#13;
     of Rp37,760.&#13;
20&#13;
     Adjusted downward for the investment made by the property developer.&#13;
21&#13;
     Fifty hectares (ha) per year converted to developed land is justified as follows. Currently, the estimated land area within 100 meters of the Citarum river is 2070 ha&#13;
     (excluding tributaries), distributed as follows: water resources (135 ha), housing and Industry (730 ha), cropland (irrigated ricefield and horticulture) (825 ha), and dry&#13;
     land (380 ha). In a seven-year period, 380 ha were converted from cropland to housing and industry, or roughly 50 ha per year. There is still considerable potential in&#13;
     the future for conversion of riverside land currently used as cropland or dry land, as well as land on the banks of the tributaries.&#13;

       It is estimated that this is only a fraction of the actual water extracted by industries. Including illegal water intake by industries, this value might be&#13;
     higher by a factor of three.&#13;

 3.2 SOURCES OF WATER POLLUTION                                                        Textile industries are known for discharge of a wide variety&#13;
 The major share of organic pollutants is from domestic-                               of pollutants if no sufficient treatment is available. Among&#13;
 municipal sources, whereas for heavy metals, it is from in-                           others, these are phenols and chromium. Studies refer to&#13;
 dustrial sources. Table 3.1 shows current water use between                           chromium levels exceeding the World Health Organiza-&#13;

 of Bandung, for instance, the industrial percentage is far                            a factor of three higher than reported values, and conse-&#13;
 lower than in Cimahi City. The major part of industrial                               quently, the pollution caused by industries might be higher.&#13;
 water use, on average, is 84% by textile industries.                                  In this report, the official values are applied.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 Water quality in most locations in the upper Citarum Riv-        This study shows that there is a wide range of benefits as-&#13;
 er basin is poor, and pollution levels far exceed the maxi-      sociated with cleaning up the Citarum River. These benefits&#13;

 ing in the past 20 years and is likely to continue to do so if   ing very favorable BCRs. Benefit-cost ratios exceeding two&#13;
 no considerable effort is made to reverse it. Furthermore,       means that the benefits of implementing sanitation facilities&#13;
 there is a clear deterioration in water quality on all pa-       outweigh the total costs by more than a factor of two. Most&#13;
 rameters going from upstream areas to downstream areas.          economic benefits are gained because of improving pub-&#13;
 Domestic-municipal activities produce at least two-thirds        lic health. Resource reuse is an important component in&#13;
 of pollution, followed by industrial and agricultural-irri-      making the river cleanup economically attractive. The range&#13;
 gation activities.                                               of economic beneficiaries suggests that sufficient financing&#13;
                                                                  can be obtained for the river cleanup program. However,&#13;
 Improving the water quality in the upper Citarum River           given the large investment costs, government and external&#13;
 basin (and with that of downstream areas as well) to levels      partners play an important role in advocating for proposed&#13;
 in line with the standard values class II (BMA) is possible      interventions and providing support for upfront financing&#13;
 but requires interventions in both domestic-municipal and        needs. Involvement of private sector to facilitate resource&#13;
 industrial sectors. Focusing on one of these segments alone      recovery should be promoted.&#13;
 will most probably not result in reaching the desired quality&#13;
 improvements. Corresponding costs for domestic-munic-            Initial interventions should be based on what is achievable&#13;
 ipal and industrial wastewater interventions are approxi-        and realistic in the short and medium terms. Preparation&#13;
 mately Rp14 trillion and Rp1.6 trillion, respectively, over      of city sanitation strategies is key for making budgets avail-&#13;
 a period of 20 years. Further, an approximate investment         able for wastewater and municipal solid waste budgets. For&#13;
 of Rp0.8 trillion for municipal solid waste infrastructure is    industrial interventions, the focus should be on the bigger&#13;
 expected.                                                        industries to start with, after which the smaller industries&#13;
                                                                  should be addressed.&#13;

            Downstream impacts of water pollution in

            assessment of interventions to improve water quality

            The Economics of Sanitation Initiative
            (ESI) of the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program
            (WSP) commenced in East Asia and the Pacific region in 2006
            to generate and disseminate economic evidence on sanitation.
            A phase one study in five countries of the region, including
            Indonesia, assessed the economic costs of inadequate
            sanitation to raise the profile of sanitation nationally. A
            phase two study compared the costs with the benefits of a
            range of sanitation intervention options in five physical
            locations in Indonesia, to assist decision makers in their
            choice of sanitation technology and delivery method. Since
            the demonstrated successes of ESI in the East Asia and
            Pacific region, ESI has become a global flagship program of
            WSP. However, some economic benefits have not been fully
            evaluated in monetary terms because of methodological
            difficulties in valuing nonmarket impacts, the paucity of
            underlying data sets, and the difficulties inherent in
            attributing observed impacts to poor sanitation. Among these
            hard-to-measure benefits are the impacts of poor sanitation
            on water resources. Hence, the purpose of this study was to
            develop and pilot test a specific methodology for valuing a
            wider range of impacts related to water resource pollution
            in Indonesia.
