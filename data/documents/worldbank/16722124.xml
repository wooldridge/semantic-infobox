Global Experiences on&#13;
Expanding Water and Sanitation&#13;
Services to the Urban Poor&#13;
In 2006â&#128;&#147;07, the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) initiated research to identify barriers to&#13;
service delivery for the urban poor. The findings of the research have been presented in the&#13;
Guidance Notes on Improving Water Supply and Sanitation Services to the Urban Poor in India.&#13;
The Urban Global Practice Team of WSP decided to expand the ambit of this research to a global&#13;
context as the learnings were relevant to experiences across Africa, Latin America, and East Asia&#13;
and the Pacific. The Guidance Notes are based on an in-depth research of various initiatives from&#13;
across the world (including South Asian, African, Latin American, and East Asian and the Pacific&#13;
countries) and consultations with urban poor communities. The present volume is a documentation&#13;
of this research and supports the Guidance Notes on Services for the Urban Poor.&#13;

While the slow pace of execution can        (SNP) cell in the Corporation is grossly    implementation phase and because of&#13;
be attributed to many factors, the          understaffed. A number of positions are     a lack of any incentives for recognizing&#13;
most pertinent being the lack of            vacant, with the highest numbers of         good performance (or penalties for&#13;
institutionalization of the initiative&#13;
within the ULB, the result has been&#13;
that the programâ&#128;&#153;s fate has been&#13;
decided by whether it coincides with&#13;
the vision and ideology of the senior&#13;
municipal management or not. In large&#13;
part because a former commissioner&#13;
expressed a personal interest in the&#13;
program, the management cadre and&#13;
the frontline staff were keen to push the&#13;
program forward.&#13;
&#13;
The experience has been that&#13;
subsequent municipal commissioners&#13;
have not been able to sustain the pace&#13;
of the initiative. The other factors that&#13;
have led to the tardy progress include&#13;
the bureaucratic routine due to which&#13;
the project approval and release of&#13;
funds took very long, and delays in&#13;
mobilizing and organizing the&#13;

&amp;#12;     poor performance). For their part, ward&#13;
     office staff justify their reluctance to&#13;
     service infrastructure in Parivartan&#13;
     communities by citing improper designs,&#13;
     poor construction, and nonadherence to&#13;
     prescribed norms.&#13;
&#13;
     Nonalignment with political wings&#13;
     (elected representatives): The urban&#13;
     poor provide an enormous vote bank,&#13;
     and the Parivartan initiative can be&#13;
     viewed as undermining the influence of&#13;
     elected officials. While there is very little&#13;
     overt resistance to the program from the&#13;
     cityâ&#128;&#153;s elected officials, a majority of the&#13;
     councilors use funds allocated to them&#13;
     from numerous state and federal&#13;
     government welfare and poverty&#13;
     alleviation programs for infrastructure&#13;
     upgrading in slums and chawls. The&#13;
     value of political grants for infrastructure&#13;
     investments disbursed in Ahmedabad in&#13;
     1999â&#128;&#147;2000 was 11.3 times the SNPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

     infrastructure projects funded by these&#13;
     grants (for example, requiring no cash&#13;
     contributions as does the SNP),&#13;
     politicians have undermined the scaling&#13;
     up of Parivartan, despite their public&#13;
     expressions of support for the program.&#13;
&#13;
     Resistance from the state&#13;
     government: A principal obstacle to&#13;
     upscaling Parivartan is the state&#13;
     governmentâ&#128;&#153;s unwillingness to&#13;
     cooperate with the ULBâ&#128;&#153;s innovative&#13;
     approach to land tenure issues. The&#13;
     state government has declined to&#13;
     provide clearance (no objection&#13;
     certificates) for implementing the&#13;
     initiative in informal settlements located&#13;
     on its land.&#13;

     Protracted project approval process:&#13;
     The project approval process is lengthy,&#13;
     cumbersome, and time consuming. As it&#13;

the project. The broader community             centered approach worked where the favelas were newly-created communities&#13;

     exposed as the residents who could&#13;
     not afford the high connection fee&#13;
     and tariffs were at the mercy of those&#13;
     better off.&#13;
&#13;
     In 2004, when it was time for the&#13;
     scheme to be extended to the east&#13;
     bank of the Floodway, several&#13;
     associations came forward and&#13;
     complained to the regulatorâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
     Metropolitan Waterworks and&#13;
     Sewerage System (MWSS) Regulatory&#13;
     Officeâ&#128;&#148;that the services provided by&#13;
     the water company were not pro-poor.&#13;
     In December 2003, the entire East&#13;
     Manggahan Floodway decided to form&#13;
     a federation of associations that&#13;
     would cater to the best interests of the&#13;
     residents. Thus was formed the&#13;
     League of United Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Organization&#13;
     Network (LUPON), which consists&#13;
     of 21 registered associations22&#13;
     comprising 8,814 households, that is,&#13;
     approximately 45,000 people.&#13;
&#13;
     LUPON decided to conduct an&#13;
     awareness program for the residents,&#13;
     to make them aware of different options&#13;
     for water supply systems (including&#13;
     bulk selling, public faucets, group taps,&#13;
     and individual taps) and to ascertain&#13;
     community perceptions on the&#13;
     appropriate scheme of distribution for&#13;
     their communities. The majority of the&#13;
     residents showed their willingness for&#13;

     Box 17: Technical Innovations: Community Toilet with Decentralized Wastewater Treatment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The Decentralized Wastewater Treatment System (DEWATS) is an innovative technological option for the treatment of&#13;
     sewage in areas where there are no treatment systems or underground drainage. DEWATS is an on-site wastewater&#13;
     treatment system that requires low organization, is environment friendly, and has low maintenance cost (it works on the&#13;
     principle of gravity flow and thus there are no electricity costs).&#13;
&#13;
     BORDA, a Germany-based organization, has partnered with a nongovernmental organization, Exnora International, for&#13;
     setting up the first DEWATS-linked community toilet in East Devadanam, Tiruchirapalli. The DEWATS module includes a&#13;
     biogas digester and anaerobic baffle reactor, which act as the primary treatment system, followed by an aerobic planted&#13;
     gravel filter and collection tank, which acts as the secondary treatment system. The wastewater from the menâ&#128;&#153;s and&#13;
     womenâ&#128;&#153;s toilet flows into the biogas settler through underground pipelines. The primary treatment system is treated with&#13;
     cow dung slurry for micro-organisms during the commissioning of the plant. The gas production takes place after a&#13;
     digestion period of 30 to 90 days. The biogas is used in the community canteen. The digested slurry along with the&#13;
     sludge flows into the anaerobic baffle reactor where the sludge settles down due to gravitational flow in a series of&#13;
     chambers. The clarified wastewater is further treated in the planted gravel filter, where plants such as Cana Indica and&#13;
     common reeds absorb the nutrients present in the wastewater and the aerobic bacterial inoculums present in the&#13;
     planted gravel filter bed further digests the sludge, if any. The wastewater produced is clear with no odor and can be let&#13;
     out into any water body. The treated water has a biochemical oxygen demand value of less than 30 mg/liter, which is the&#13;
     standard set by the Bureau of Indian Standards for safe discharge of wastewater into any water body.&#13;
&#13;
     In East Devadanam, the DEWATS is designed to treat 9 cubic meters of wastewater per day and the gas produced from&#13;
     the biogas digester is utilized for the lighting of the child-friendly toilet and for cooking and heating purposes. The treated&#13;
     wastewater is used for irrigation in the nearby organic vegetable garden maintained by various self-help groups that is a&#13;
     source of income for these groups. The entire operation and maintenance is carried out by the Sanitation and Hygiene&#13;
     Education team.&#13;

&amp;#12;     supply, wastewater, sewage, and&#13;
     solid waste management in all&#13;
     community toilets is a concrete step&#13;
     that city authorities need to take to&#13;
     maintain hygiene standards and&#13;
     financial viability.&#13;
&#13;
     Why is community participation&#13;
     and management a better option&#13;
     than contracting out of urban&#13;
     social infrastructure?&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Community participation alone&#13;
       can guarantee low-cost,&#13;
       well-designed, and user-friendly&#13;
       urban slum infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Community management alone can&#13;
       sustain capital infrastructure through&#13;
       timely operations and management,&#13;
       by relying on members and users&#13;
       as participants in this effort and not&#13;
       simply as clients for a business&#13;
       opportunity. Institutionalizing&#13;
       community participation requires the&#13;
       support and involvement of local&#13;
       NGOs and the federation of&#13;
       individual slumsâ&#128;&#153; managers into a&#13;
       citywide federation to become&#13;
       effective and engage with the&#13;
       municipality or utilities as equals.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Community-managed infrastructure&#13;
       can provide not only sanitation&#13;
       facilities but can also be upgraded&#13;
       for bathing and washing facilities&#13;
       at affordable costs for the poorest&#13;
       urban slum dwellers.&#13;
&#13;
     The community-managed toilets&#13;
     supported by Gramalaya in&#13;
     Tiruchirapalli have been operational for&#13;
     six years now. All are in use, many are&#13;
     well managed and communities are&#13;
     being declared ODF. However, a&#13;
     number of challenges are emerging&#13;
     both to the sustainability of the toilets&#13;
     and to further scaling up of this&#13;
     approach throughout the city.&#13;

Delivery Reform: Customer&#13;
Meets Campaign&#13;
&#13;
The catalyst for service delivery reforms&#13;
in the Water Board was an initiative&#13;
called the Customer Meets campaign,&#13;
undertaken over a two-week period in&#13;
November 1998. The aim of the&#13;
campaign was â&#128;&#152;to mold board&#13;
employees to dedicate themselves to&#13;
customer careâ&#128;&#153;. It was achieved&#13;
through face-to-face meetings between&#13;
senior managers and citizens in order&#13;
to learn about the consumerâ&#128;&#153;s service&#13;
needs and concerns.&#13;
&#13;
In attending these meetings senior&#13;
managers were confronted with large&#13;

   In 1998, when the Andhra Pradesh State Government and&#13;
the Hyderabad Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board were&#13;
on the verge of securing a US$300 million loan from the World&#13;
Bank to undertake a second water and sanitation infrastructure&#13;
and service delivery improvement project in Hyderabad, the&#13;
Indian Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s decision to conduct a nuclear test in May&#13;
1998 placed this project on an indefinite hold. Both the World&#13;
Bank and the International Monetary Fund suspended their&#13;
ongoing programs and withdrew from India and Pakistan.&#13;
45&#13;
   The program provides a federal subsidy of 50 percent of the&#13;
connection charge (approximately US$115) for households in&#13;
the cityâ&#128;&#153;s approximately 800 designated slum neighborhoods.&#13;
The charge can also be paid in installments over a five-month&#13;
period without interest.&#13;

management utility company, signed in&#13;

Other commercialization activities&#13;
carried out by the Corporation included&#13;
the indexation of tariff to protect it from&#13;
externalities such as inflation and take&#13;
into account changes in production&#13;
costs, and thus maintain its real value.&#13;
The tariff was indexed with effect from&#13;
March 2002 following Cabinet approval.&#13;
The indexation allows for annual&#13;
adjustment of the tariff, and entailed a&#13;

and Strategy&#13;

     the state government releases funds&#13;
     for the project, and 50 percent during&#13;
     implementation. Users also separately&#13;
     pay for sewer connections and&#13;
     monthly sewer maintenance charges&#13;
     (which are designed to cover the&#13;
     actual cost of maintenance). The&#13;
     capital costs for the scheme include&#13;
     operation and maintenance costs for&#13;
     one year. Since public contributions&#13;
     are the smallest component (and are&#13;
     generally used to service part of the&#13;
     external finance cost), ULBs make&#13;
     every effort to keep the loan&#13;
     component as small as possible. The&#13;
     average contribution per household is&#13;
     about US$142. It may range from&#13;
     US$33 to US$445, depending on the&#13;
     value of the property in cities that&#13;
     have used this system for determining&#13;
     the amount of contribution to be paid.&#13;
&#13;
     Monthly sewer charge: The average&#13;
     domestic monthly sewer charge is&#13;
     US$3.5, though it could range from a&#13;
     low of US$0.66 to a high of US$11.&#13;
     The average monthly sewer charge&#13;
     for commercial properties is US$939&#13;
     and the average monthly sewer&#13;
     charge for industrial properties is&#13;
     US$12. Commercial charges&#13;
     themselves are 2.5 times that of&#13;
     domestic charges, and industrial&#13;
     charges 3.5 times. The parastatals&#13;
     oversee the construction of the&#13;
     physical infrastructure, which is then&#13;
     handed over to ULBs to operate.&#13;
     The contractor used to build the&#13;
     infrastructure is responsible for&#13;
     maintenance during the first year, and&#13;
     may or may not be reappointed&#13;
     depending on performance. In most&#13;
     cases, ULBs continue to contract out&#13;
     operation and maintenance, even&#13;
     after the first year.&#13;

&amp;#12;      8 to 10 volunteer members, three-&#13;
      fourths of which were required to be&#13;
      women. Women were to hold positions&#13;
      of treasurer, and either secretary or&#13;
      chairperson of the committee. The&#13;
      mission of these WUCs was to develop&#13;
      appropriate sustainable water&#13;
      development plans that were&#13;
      manageable and affordable for their&#13;
      respective community. They were&#13;
      responsible for planning, supervising,&#13;
      and coordinating all activities related to&#13;
      water improvement efforts. Through&#13;
      WUC efforts, citizens were encouraged&#13;
      to make contributions in the form of&#13;
      money or manual labor for construction&#13;
      and operation and maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
      The street chairmen played an&#13;
      important role in the WUCsâ&#128;&#153; activities&#13;
      by facilitating community meetings and&#13;
      exercising their influence to promote&#13;
      the program. Community contribution&#13;
      targets were established, identifying&#13;
      the amount of funds required to be&#13;
      obtained before construction of any&#13;
      water-related hardware could be&#13;
      initiated in a given street.&#13;
&#13;
      When repairs were requested by the&#13;
      WUAs, it was the WUCâ&#128;&#153;s responsibility&#13;
      to contact the appropriate workforce,&#13;
      and ensure the completion of work.&#13;
      Water systems also required that highly&#13;
      specialized and technical tasks be&#13;
      performed, such as testing water&#13;
      quality, assessing water table levels,&#13;
      and siting of new water points and&#13;
      pipes. The Water Authority provided&#13;
      technical expertise and training to&#13;
      local resource people in many of&#13;
      these areas.&#13;

      The WUAs faced similar problems in&#13;
      relation to operating and maintaining&#13;
      their rehabilitated borewells. To address&#13;

Challenges for&#13;
the Program&#13;
The Dar es Salaam Community-&#13;
Managed Water and Sanitation Program&#13;
experienced a number of significant&#13;
challenges in its efforts to achieve the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s objectives. Some of the major&#13;
challenges reflected issues of&#13;
community mobilization, political&#13;
interference, and difficulties related to&#13;
group coordination and collaboration.&#13;
&#13;
Mobilization: Certain segments of the&#13;
community were difficult to mobilize due&#13;
to past experiences with development&#13;
projects or concerns that the focus of&#13;
this program might be water-related&#13;
commercial activities. A great deal of&#13;
distrust was initially expressed about the&#13;
program due to a large number of failed&#13;
development projects in the past. Water&#13;
vendors raised concerns that the&#13;
program would compete directly against&#13;
their interests and they, therefore, did&#13;
not want to participate. Some of these&#13;
concerns stemmed from a lack of&#13;
understanding about the potential&#13;
benefits of the program to water users&#13;
and vendors. In response, WaterAid,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         113&#13;

   autonomous projects connected to the main supply network of the city. This model involves connecting to the main&#13;
   supply network, a system of secondary networks that feed one or more public tanks so that users receive a direct service&#13;
   from the cityâ&#128;&#153;s network. In many cases, house connections have been made, where consumption is measured with&#13;
   macrometers. This system needs storage tanks, macrometers, secondary networks, and public or community cisterns.&#13;
   The UEBD has also developed many systems that are supplied by wells where water is pumped to a storage tank for&#13;
   ongoing distribution. The UEBD has built 95 such systems covering 28,985 houses and benefiting 176,913 persons in&#13;
   peri-urban neighborhoods.&#13;
&#13;
   Consumption is invoiced through a macrometer, which registers the consumption of the entire community. The Water&#13;
   Administration Boards (JAAs), or councils of the neighborhood, are responsible for the maintenance and operation of&#13;
   secondary networks, including the collection of user charges. The amount charged covers the operating and&#13;
   administrative costs, the payment of the water bill as measured by the macrometer. and the payment to a revolving fund,&#13;
   which finances projects for five to 10 years, free of interest. When the JAA makes full payment to the fund, the UEBD&#13;
   provides confirmation to the commercial area of the National Autonomous System of Aqueducts and Sewers to establish&#13;
   the rate to be charged subsequently.&#13;
&#13;
   Community tanks supplied by tank cars for ongoing distribution: Another system that the UEBD is implementing in&#13;
   peri-urban neighborhoods that are distant or have difficult access is the communal water tank supplied by cistern-cars. It&#13;
   is considered as a provisional solution in cases where it is not feasible to connect to city-level water networks. Water&#13;
   supply by cistern-cars results in higher costs than the previous system since cistern-cars need fuel for transportation. This&#13;
   system needs storage tanks (supplied by tank cars), secondary networks, and public or community cisterns. A variant of&#13;
   this system is one that has a reservoir (storage tank) supplied with water by a tank truck, which subsequently feeds public&#13;
   tanks through secondary networks. Twenty-one such projects have been implemented, supplying water to more than&#13;
   59,232 persons (9,872 households). The JAAs are responsible for administering the system, delegating the duty to ensure&#13;
   an ongoing supply through tank cars and for collecting water expenses from the population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Administration Board (JAA) or a             community JAAs have been formed                                       new system (this stood at US$ 42 and&#13;

initiative. An outreach campaign is&#13;
conducted prior to any capital works to&#13;
allow the community to voice any&#13;
concerns and to assist with design (for&#13;
advising on the best locations for the&#13;
lines) and implementation. Also,&#13;
building community ownership is&#13;
helpful in project implementation.&#13;
Residents may allow for pipes to&#13;
traverse their property and help monitor&#13;
the works to guarantee quality&#13;
workmanship. Three components are&#13;
key for community mobilization:&#13;
(a) forming a community committee;&#13;
(b) holding a communication strategy&#13;
workshop; and (c) community&#13;
mobilization. Adequate financial and&#13;
human resources have been allocated&#13;
for this effort.&#13;
&#13;
Key Outcomes&#13;
The delegated management model for&#13;
water services is an innovative&#13;
partnership between the water&#13;
company and private operators. The&#13;
approach makes it possible for peri-&#13;
urban households to have a private&#13;
(individual) connection at reduced&#13;
prices as compared to the earlier&#13;
situation of paying high prices for&#13;
poor service. This model allows the&#13;
development of a range of services&#13;
(private connections, shared&#13;
standpipes, commercial kiosks) to&#13;
match the demand of households,&#13;
while maintaining the overall&#13;
sustainability of the water company.&#13;
Customers have also reported&#13;
improvements in water quality.This&#13;
model officially recognizes that rising&#13;
block tariffs may be detrimental to&#13;
households that resell water and offers&#13;
a commercial tariff that does not rise&#13;
with increasing levels of consumption.&#13;
&#13;
Minimizing the business risk is another&#13;
integral characteristic of the model. The&#13;

&#13;
The board is made up of representatives from the resident development committees, local authorities, Lusaka Water and&#13;
Sewerage Company, and selected members of the community. The board is responsible for providing policy direction,&#13;
developing implementation strategies, sanctioning of procurement, and employment of staff, including the scheme&#13;
manager. Generally, the board consists of nine members called trustees.&#13;
&#13;
The management team is responsible for the day-to-day management of the scheme. The board employs the manager&#13;
who in turn hires the rest of the staff based on the criteria set by the board. The scheme managerâ&#128;&#153;s role is to supervise&#13;
the operations of the staff such as water vendors or tap attendants (who sell water on behalf of the scheme), plumbers,&#13;
and cashiers. The manager is answerable to the board.&#13;
&#13;
Vendors or tap attendants are recruited from among community members. The selection criterion is basic numerical&#13;
and reading skills. The tap attendants or vendors sign a water point operation and maintenance contract with&#13;
management and receive a monthly commission, which is 331/3 percent of total sales. Vendorâ&#128;&#153;s encash collections every&#13;
day at the trust offices located within the area being served. The water is sold in 20 liter containers to individuals or&#13;
organizations or as a daily entitlement to monthly prepaid customers. Water vendors or tap attendants also ensure that&#13;
any faults are reported as soon as they are detected. The model allows for an extra pool of vendors to be trained to&#13;
ensure continuity in case one is not available due to illness or other factors.&#13;

Implementation Strategies&#13;
&#13;
The strategic approach used is&#13;
participatory and voluntary. It&#13;
encompasses the effective&#13;
understanding by beneficiaries of the&#13;
entire cycle involved in the process of&#13;
individual connections and the&#13;
installation of public standpipes, and&#13;
allows for subsidies from the&#13;
government and its partners.&#13;
&#13;
At the start of the implementation of the&#13;
policy, SdE and SONES organized an&#13;
extensive communication campaignâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
including signs, posters, forums in&#13;
residential areas, television and radio&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In 2006-07, the Water and Sanitation
            Program (WSP) initiated research to identify barriers to
            service delivery for the urban poor. The findings of the
            research have been presented in the Guidance Notes on
            Improving Water Supply and Sanitation Services to the Urban
            Poor in India. The Urban Global Practice Team of WSP decided
            to expand the ambit of this research to a global context as
            the learnings were relevant to experiences across Africa,
            Latin America, and East Asia and the Pacific. The Guidance
            Notes are based on an in-depth research of various
            initiatives from across the world (including South Asian,
            African, Latin American, and East Asian and the Pacific
            countries) and consultations with urban poor communities.
            The present volume is a documentation of this research and
            supports the Guidance Notes on Services for the Urban Poor.
            Section 1 of this report consists of 19 case studies.
            Section 2 describes consultations with urban poor
            communities. The main aim of the consultations was to record
            the issues they confronted related to water supply and sanitation.
