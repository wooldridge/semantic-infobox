NATIVE FORESTS AND PROTECTED AREAS PROJECT&#13;
1.   NATIVE FORESTS AND PROTECTED AREAS&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1   The area of land with woody vegetation in Argentina is estimated at about 64&#13;
million hectares (23 percent of the country), of which forested land is estimated at&#13;
between 35 and 45 million hectares. The area of native forest with commercial potential is&#13;
estimated at about 15 million hectares; it produces about 1.5 million m3 of wood per&#13;
annum, equal to about 40 percent of the country's annual production. Preliminary studies&#13;
of about 78 percent of the land area of Argentina show that about 10 percent is affected&#13;
by water erosion and 9 percent by wind erosion. Overgrazing and the destruction of the&#13;
perennial vegetative cover (including loss of native forests) are contributing factors.&#13;
Desertification in parts of the Chaco is one of the more problematic results of this&#13;
degradation trend.&#13;
1.2   Argentina has barely begun to address the issues raised by its potential for&#13;
producing public goods and services from its native forests, except through the&#13;
establishment and management of a system of protected areas. The country lacks an&#13;
inventory of its native forests, an evaluation of environmental threats to them and their&#13;
economic implications, and a solid research and information base on which to base analysis&#13;
of policy options. Without such information and analysis, it is difficult to develop either&#13;
realistic plans or political consensus on how best to manage these natural resources in the&#13;
public interest.&#13;
1.3   For example, the Chaco ecoregion, with an area of about I million km2, is the&#13;
second most extensive ecosystem in Latin America, and 46 percent of it is located in&#13;
Argentina. Despite this, and in sharp contrast to the Amazon ecosystem, it has received&#13;
relatively little attention and remains poorly researched despite the critical role this&#13;
woodland ecosystem is believed to play in providing a habitat for many endangered&#13;
species of plants and animals, preventing desertification over vast areas of Argentina,&#13;
eastern Paraguay, and Bolivia, and protecting and regulating both the quantity and quality&#13;
of an important part of the water supply to two of the Region's principal rivers: the&#13;
Paraguay and the Parana.&#13;
1.4   Argentina falls just short of being ranked as one of the Latin America and the&#13;
Caribbean (LAC) Region's countries with extraordinary diversity in terms of natural&#13;
ecosystems. Yet it does have a diverse set of ecosystems and a wide range of plants and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
animals. It is believed that there are about 300 species of mammals, 980 species of birds,&#13;
250 species of reptiles, 140 species of amphibians, and 312 species of fresh-water fish in&#13;
Argentina. Many of these species are considered to be endangered or threatened, due in&#13;
part to the loss of native forests.&#13;
1.5   Many countries use national parks and other protected areas as a means of&#13;
protecting flora and fauna. Argentina is no exception, and about 4.4 percent of the&#13;
national territory (about 12.1 million hectares) is protected. Argentina's percentage of&#13;
total protected area is about average ror a group of countries examined. Of the total area&#13;
protected in Argentina, about 22 percent is in national parks and the remaining 78 percent&#13;
is under provincial or other control. However, many of the provincial protected areas are&#13;
truly "paper parks," with no active management or day-to-day presence of guards.&#13;
1.6   What is more important than designation of protected areas, however, is the mix of&#13;
ecosystems represented and the level of management. For example, only 0.2 percent of&#13;
the land area of the Pampa grasslands, 0.5 percent of the Chaco, 4.2 percent of the&#13;
Interior Atlantic coastal forest, and 5.6 percent of the Yungus are represented in protected&#13;
areas. In addition, a recent analysis of management effectiveness in Argentina's protected&#13;
areas estimated that less than 21 percent of the area under protection is acceptably&#13;
managed, 30 percent is under some form of management though insufficient, and almost&#13;
50 percent receives little or no management whatever. Most of the area falling into the&#13;
latter two categories is under the jurisdiction of provincial or municipal authorities or&#13;
private landholders.&#13;
B. Priorities for Government Action&#13;
1.7   The challenge facing the Argentine government in the management and&#13;
conservation of native forests and protected areas is to develop and to put in place, at both&#13;
the federal and provincial levels, the institutional capacity, the information base, and the&#13;
policy, legal, and regulatory regimes that would encourage decision makers in both the&#13;
public and private sectors to strike an appropriate balance over time between the&#13;
production of public and private goods and services in native forests and protected areas.&#13;
Defining an appropriate role for the state is critical in the development and consideration&#13;
of government options.&#13;
1.8   Native forests produce commercial products such as timber, charcoal, and nuts,&#13;
but they also produce a range of non-commercial goods and services. Examples are:&#13;
serving as sinks for carbon sequestration, a global externality; preventing soil erosion,&#13;
buffering water flows, and protecting biodiversity and watersheds, which generate global,&#13;
regional, and/or national externalities. The production of important public goods by native&#13;
forests requires that they be treated in special ways by the state and society at large.&#13;
1.9   The policies that contribute most to the destruction of native forests are those that&#13;
constrain growth of the Argentine economy. Macroeconomic instability in earlier decades,&#13;
which led to low or negative economic growth rates, contributed to loss of native forests&#13;
by: (a) lessening the alternative job opportunities for poor rural families and thereby&#13;
increasing the attractiveness of subsistence agriculture in or close to native forested areas;&#13;
(b) lessening the investment opportunities available to most commercial farmers and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
thereby making attractive the farming of land which in a well-managed economy would be&#13;
regarded as sub-marginal for agriculture and left under native forests; (c) fostering&#13;
inflation, which boosted the demand for inflation hedges, and, thus, the demand for land as&#13;
a long-term but illiquid hedge, and cattle as a short-term and very liquid hedge, these&#13;
demands encouraged expansion of the crop and livestock frontiers at the expense of native&#13;
forests; (d) making counterpart funds scarcer and thereby depriving protected areas and&#13;
other native forests of effective protection; and (e) lowering the priority attached to the&#13;
preservation of native forests at the national level because of very pressing&#13;
macroeconomic concerns. In view of this, the general policy framework that is good for&#13;
efficient economic growth in general, is also likely to be most supportive of conserving&#13;
native forests and strengthening the protected areas system, particularly over the medium-&#13;
and long-term. Consequently, maintaining and deepening the reform process now&#13;
underway in Argentina is a high priority for conserving native forests and strengthening&#13;
the protected areas system.&#13;
1.10  In addition to putting in place policies and regulations which foster overall efficient&#13;
economic growth, the government faces many additional challenges in developing and&#13;
implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy for conserving native forests and&#13;
strengthening the protective areas system. One challenge is to realize the efficient growth&#13;
potential of commercial forestry in Argentina while avoiding the negative externalities&#13;
associated with the loss of native forests to logging and conversion to other uses. This&#13;
requires, inter alia, that the future source of growth in the output of commercial forestry&#13;
products shifts progressively toward plantations and away from native forests. In turn,&#13;
this requires a rapid increase in both the productivity and output of plantations, but this&#13;
growth should be efficient and, therefore, quite different from much that occurred in the&#13;
past. It should be driven by improved access to better quality information, technology and&#13;
incentives which reflect the full range of costs and benefits, both private and public. The&#13;
Forestry Development Project, which is being implemented by the Secretariat of&#13;
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (SAPyA), and supported by a Bank loan (Ln. 3948-AR)&#13;
of US$16.0 million, helps the government to provide appropriate public sector support to&#13;
forest plantations, timber processing industries, and agroforestry.&#13;
1.11  While efficient economic growth and appropriate public sector support for forest&#13;
plantations are necessary conditions for the conservation of Argentine native forests and&#13;
protected areas over the medium- to long-term, they alone are not sufficient. In the short-&#13;
to medium-term in particular, accelerated economic growth will place increased pressure&#13;
on some native forests from commercial logging. This could be the result of more&#13;
profitable logging opportunities due to stronger domestic demand for the logs which come&#13;
from native forests, lower transport costs, more efficient ports, and a more productive and&#13;
motivated labor force. The same forces that may drive commercial loggers to cut more&#13;
trees in native forests could also lead to the clearing of selected native forests for&#13;
alternative land uses such as cropping and ranching. While some of these activities would&#13;
undoubtedly be efficient from an economy-wide perspective, much of it would probably&#13;
not be, particularly in instances where substantial negative externalities would be involved&#13;
and decisions to cut the native forests are based on a consideration of private costs and&#13;
benefits only. Therefore, the government cannot depend exclusively on market forces to&#13;
determine the use of resources in native forests because the presence of substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
externalities will lead the private sector, acting alone, to misallocate resources in too many&#13;
instances.&#13;
1.12   A major challenge, therefore, is to find efficient and effective ways of preventing&#13;
this misallocation of resources in native forests. One such way is to reform the policy,&#13;
legal and regulatory framework. At a minimum, the policies and regulations that create&#13;
incentives to destroy native forests in an inefficient manner should be identified and&#13;
changed. In addition, an optimal policy, legal and regulatory framework would actually&#13;
encourage decision makers, both public and private, to internalize in their decision making&#13;
processes the full range of costs and benefits resulting from management decisions&#13;
affecting native forests and protected areas. Identifying ways to prevent misallocation of&#13;
resources in native forests as a result of deficiencies in the policy, legal and regulatory&#13;
framework would require a substantial amount of effort. Since nearly all forests (apart&#13;
from national parks) are under provincial jurisdiction and are privately owned, and since a&#13;
high percentage of the policies and regulations are also at the provincial level, the federal&#13;
government would have to use persuasion and incentives to bring about the desired&#13;
changes.&#13;
1.13   Two kinds of policy instruments are available to effect the production of non-&#13;
commercial forestry products on privately-owned land (most native forests in Argentina&#13;
are privately owned): (a) market-based instruments, such as payments and taxes; and (b)&#13;
"command and control" instruments, such as regulations and standards. In general,&#13;
market-based instruments are to be preferred to "command and control" measures. More&#13;
specifically, the guiding principle should be to pay for the production of public goods from&#13;
the forest sector or, alternatively, to tax competing goods, with due regard to the net&#13;
effect on the government budget and resource allocation within the rural economy. If the&#13;
value of the public goods that would be generated from the proper management of&#13;
privately owned native forests is substantial, there should be no objection, in principle, to&#13;
the government paying to such private owners an appropriate price in the form of a&#13;
conservation payment for these goods and/or services flowing to society, provided such&#13;
payments are necessary to preserve the flow of such public goods and services.&#13;
1.14   Before attempting to implement any such payment schemes, however, research&#13;
information is required on the magnitude and value of the non-commercial goods and&#13;
services produced in different native forests, and how the production levels of such goods&#13;
and services might be most efficiently increased or maintained, as appropriate. Research&#13;
of this kind would, in most instances, be appropriately seen as a public good.' For&#13;
example, research to identify critical watersheds and habitat, and on the merits of the&#13;
various options for protecting such watersheds and habitat, produces public goods and&#13;
services and justifies, in principle, public sector financing. Generating the research&#13;
information necessary for reaching a political consensus on the value of such public goods&#13;
and services, as well as designing effective and efficient payments schemes, is, therefore, a&#13;
research priority for the managers of native forests in Argentina.&#13;
I The term "public good" is used here to describe goods that produce substantial positive externalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
1.15   Federal payments to provinces for conservation as part of a national system for the&#13;
management of native forests are likely to be among the few mechanisms the federal&#13;
government will have for influencing provincial forest policies and regulations.&#13;
Conservation payments should be given to a province only when its forestry policies and&#13;
regulations meet minimum federal standards. Such federal controls are necessary because&#13;
payments alone will be ineffective if other parts of the incentive system are incorrect.&#13;
There may also be externalities not well internalized at the provincial level, but which are&#13;
internalized at the federal level. Designing appropriate and effective federal/provincial&#13;
roles and relationships in the management of native forests and protected areas is a major&#13;
challenge in Argentina.&#13;
1.16  Another dimension of these native forest ecosystems is their ability to generate&#13;
global externalities, in the form of globally unique biodiversity as well as reduction of&#13;
greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration. As the costs of capturing these&#13;
global externalities, however, are largely additional to the costs that would be incurred for&#13;
investments contributing to Argentina's sustainable development, they pose financial&#13;
burdens which the country is ill-prepared to meet. In such circumstances, it may be&#13;
appropriate to solicit financing from grant sources (such as the GEF), in support of high&#13;
priority, cost-effective programs with identifiable global benefits.&#13;
C. Major Public Sector Institutions Involved&#13;
1.17   The role of the state in the management and conservation of native forests and&#13;
protected areas mapped out above would include: (a) adapting existing policies, laws and&#13;
regulations to new requirements; (b) managing in an effective way the protected areas&#13;
system; (c) generating and disseminating relevant information and data and making it&#13;
available to interested parties directly or through extension activities; and (d) fostering&#13;
relevant training at all levels.&#13;
1.18  To perform this role adequately, substantial improvement is required in the existing&#13;
institutional capacity. The Argentine National Forestry Institute (IFONA), an autonomous&#13;
agency under the institutional umbrella of the SAPyA, was responsible for overall&#13;
management of the forest sector until late 1991, when it was dismantled.2 IFONA's&#13;
functions were divided between the newly-created Directorate for Native Forests (DRFN)&#13;
within the Secretariat of Natural Resources and Human Environment (SRNyAH), which&#13;
was given responsibility for all aspects of native forests, and the SAPyA's Directorate for&#13;
Forestry Production (DPF), which was given responsibility for forest plantations, timber&#13;
processing industries, and agroforestry. The National Parks Administration (APN), a&#13;
semi-autonomous agency within SRNyAH, has responsibility for protected areas at the&#13;
federal level.&#13;
1.19  The 23 Argentinean provinces have different structures of government and&#13;
administration. In the forest sector, however, while the names of the administrative units&#13;
differ, the general institutional design is relatively simple. The focal point is a provincial&#13;
Forestry Directorate (Direccion de Bosques) with responsibility for coordinating the&#13;
2   Decree 2284 of October. 31, 199 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
forestry-related activities of all entities, including national, for both native and planted&#13;
forests.&#13;
D. Previous Bank Lending&#13;
1.20  This is the Bank's second free-standing forestry project in Argentina. Earlier, as&#13;
part of the Agricultural Services and Institutional Development Project the Bank&#13;
supported a small sub-component for forestry research (US$1.9 million), and more&#13;
recently it approved the Forestry Development Project (Ln. 3948-AR), which focuses on&#13;
forest plantations, timber processing industries and agroforestry and is being implemented&#13;
by SAPyA.&#13;
E. Lessons from General Bank Experience&#13;
1.21   The Bank has lent over US$2 billion for forestry components and free-standing&#13;
forestry projects. The Forestry Policy Paper of 1978 re-directed Bank financing from an&#13;
almost exclusive focus on industrial forestry, to a new generation of social and rural&#13;
development, and environmental forestry projects. Sector work was stressed as the&#13;
critical link between the policy statement and the lending program. Only one&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR), and no Project Audit Report (PAR), exists for&#13;
the forestry sector in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region, Lessons learned and&#13;
other conclusions are derived from Bank studies of sectoral experience. A 1991&#13;
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) study of the Bank's forestry experience&#13;
concludes that the overall performance of this new generation of projects has been&#13;
satisfactory.3 However, consolidation may be a problem given the long maturation period&#13;
of such projects, especially of their institutional development objectives. The OED study&#13;
indicates that the nature, structure and operational effectiveness of institutions are critical&#13;
determinants of the impact of environmental forestry projects, and that this is likely to&#13;
intensify in the 1990s as political pressure is exerted on environmental and forestry&#13;
institutions to broaden their agendas to incorporate protection, management, biodiversity&#13;
and conservation.&#13;
1.22   An analysis carried out by OED concludes that the development frontier for the&#13;
forest sector in the 1990s is in institutional and human resources, as well as research and&#13;
information systems for forest and other natural resources. Macroeconomic policies and&#13;
the incentive structure, including the legal and regulatory context, are vital, especially for&#13;
enhancing private sector conservation involvement. These lessons are also generally&#13;
corroborated by the 1991 Board paper on Forestry and the 1994 Board paper on forestry&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
1.23   The proposed project represents an appropriate set of public sector interventions&#13;
aimed at improving the productivity of native forests while being sensitive to&#13;
environmental issues in native forest and other ecologically fragile areas. It heeds lessons&#13;
from Bank and non-Bank projects, in LAC as well as in Asia and Africa, that native&#13;
forests and other wildlands are a resource capable of being managed for multiple outputs,&#13;

including environmental services, and that the government has a key role to play in&#13;
protecting critical habitat. A description of lessons learned and how the project was&#13;
designed to take these lessons into account is given in Annex A.&#13;
F. Bank Group Strategy&#13;
1.24  The Bank's country assistance objectives and strategy for dealing with native&#13;
forests and the protected areas system have been defined through intensive mission&#13;
contact since the start of 1992, leading to a Forestry Sector Review (Report No. 11833-&#13;
AR, dated April 26, 1993), and continuing into the identification, preparation and&#13;
appraisal of the proposed project. The solutions to the issues and problems that confront&#13;
Argentine native forests and protected areas are consistent with the Bank's country&#13;
assistance strategy and its forestry, environmental, and sector policies. Bank support for&#13;
economy-wide policies and actions necessary, inter alia, for the realization of Argentina's&#13;
commercial forestry potential is being pursued as part of the country dialogue and&#13;
economic work program.&#13;
1.25  Regarding native forests and the protected areas system, it is proposed that the&#13;
other policies and actions deemed appropriate be pursued under the proposed Native&#13;
Forests and Protected Areas Project. The Bank can be of great assistance to the&#13;
government in helping it to develop and to implement an appropriate state role in the&#13;
conservation and management of native forests and the development and management of&#13;
the protected areas system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin and Concept&#13;
2.1    Because of the commercial products produced by native forests, and the positive&#13;
externalities benefiting the domestic economy which they and protective areas produce,&#13;
the Government gives high priority to their improved management and conservation, as&#13;
evidenced by the establishment of SRNyAH, the ratification of the Biodiversity&#13;
Convention, and the elaboration of a Biodiversity Strategy. The recently completed&#13;
Forestry Sector Review (Report No. 11833-AR, dated April 26, 1993), and the follow-up&#13;
discussions with Government, including those related to the preparation of the proposed&#13;
project, have provided useful opportunities for exploring the strategic options open to&#13;
government. The emerging strategy now envisages a role for the state in native forests&#13;
and protected areas which would focus on: (a) the creation of a framework of policies,&#13;
laws, regulations and norms which efficiently protects and enhances the flows of goods&#13;
and services from native forests and protected areas, including, in particular, the flows of&#13;
public goods and services; (b) the generation of information required for the appropriate&#13;
management of native forests and protected areas, giving due weight to the production of&#13;
both private and public goods and services; and (c) the maintenance under direct public&#13;
sector management, or under some form of public sector-sanctioned management regime,&#13;
of native forest areas with the potential to produce particularly valuable flows of public&#13;
goods and services in a cost-effective manner. The proposed project would help the&#13;
Government implement the public sector role outlined here in partnership with other&#13;
members of the civil society.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
2.2   The objectives of the project are to: (a) help SRNyAH prioritize its proposed&#13;
actions dealing with native forests; (b) facilitate the development of an incentive and&#13;
regulatory framework which would encourage decision makers, both public and private, to&#13;
more fully internalize within their decision making processes the full range of social costs&#13;
and benefits associated with their decisions and actions affecting native forests; (c)&#13;
develop a plan for transforming APN into a world-class park management organization;&#13;
and (d) increase the environmentally sustainable level of tourism in four national parks:&#13;
Lanin, Nahuel Huapi, Los Alerces, and Los Glaciares.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
Project Components&#13;
2.3   To achieve these objectives the project would: (a) prepare draft legislation for&#13;
reforming the policy and regulatory framework affecting native forests at both the federal&#13;
and provincial levels; (b) carry out an inventory of native forests from which it would&#13;
generate and disseminate information on the geographic distribution of native forests&#13;
within Argentina; (c) based on the inventory and other analysis, identify the priority areas&#13;
of native forests deserving of protection; (d) based on the findings of an applied research&#13;
and studies program and other information, develop options from which the government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
and the private sector might choose an appropriate response to different threats in these&#13;
priority areas; (e) develop a plan for transforming APN into a world-class park&#13;
management organization; (f) build additional infrastructure and improve management in&#13;
four national parks (Lanin, Nahuel Huapi, Los Alerces, and Los Glaciares); and (g)&#13;
establish a project implementation unit (PIU) which would assist DRFN and APN with&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
2.4   The project would have three components: (a) generation and dissemination of&#13;
research and information; (b) protected areas; and (c) project implementation.&#13;
Generation and Dissemination of Research and Information Component&#13;
(Baseline Costs US$13.4 million)&#13;
2.5   An information generation and dissemination component would support actions&#13;
and investments aimed at generating information with a high public-good content&#13;
concerning native forests and protected areas. It would have the following three sub-&#13;
components: (a) reform of the policy, legal and regulatory framework affecting native&#13;
forests; (b) a national inventory of native forests, and establishment and operation of a&#13;
related database; and (c) applied research and studies to facilitate the improved&#13;
management and conservation of native forests and protected areas. Further details on&#13;
this component are given in the following paragraphs and in Annex B.&#13;
2.6   Policy, Legal and Regulatorv Reform (Baseline Costs US$0.9 million).&#13;
SRNyAH is the agency assigned responsibility for managing the federal role in native&#13;
forests. In discharging this responsibility, one of the principal instruments available to it is&#13;
the policy, legal and regulatory framework which is in place at the federal level affecting&#13;
the management of native forests. This framework has many weaknesses which must be&#13;
addressed as the first step in any strategy to improve the management of native forests in&#13;
Argentina. A detailed study would be completed of existing federal legislation and&#13;
regulations affecting the use and conservation of native forests to identify the main&#13;
obstacles to their better management, including obstacles to the internalization of&#13;
environmental values in private and public decision-making. The study would be followed&#13;
by workshops with representatives of the public and private sectors and non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs). The objectives of the workshops would be to obtain&#13;
feedback on the results of the above study, to agree on a hierarchy of problems, and to&#13;
prioritize obstacles to be removed. Draft legal documents would then be prepared,&#13;
incorporating proposed changes in existing laws and regulations.&#13;
2.7   Because most laws and regulations affecting native forests are enforced by the&#13;
provinces, a concurrent and similar effort would be launched at the provincial level with&#13;
the objective of aligning proposed provincial legislative changes with those proposed at&#13;
the federal level. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the TOR of all&#13;
consultants would include the obligation that they carry out their work on the basis, inter&#13;
alia, of the Bank's Operational Policy (OP) 4.36 on Forestry, and OP 4.04 on Natural&#13;
Habitats, which are incorporated in the Project Implementation Manual (para. 3.1 (a)).&#13;
The baseline cost of this sub-component would be US$0.9 million, and would include&#13;
expenditures for consultants, technical assistance, training tours, and workshops.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
2.8    National Inventory of Native Forests and Management of a Related Database&#13;
(Baseline Costs US$7.5 million). For SRNyAH to establish priority geographical areas of&#13;
native forests on which to focus its attention, it would require, at a minimum, certain&#13;
critical information about the total stock of native forests as a basis for analysis and&#13;
decision making. However, there has never been an inventory of native forests in&#13;
Argentina and reliable knowledge on their extent, ownership, distribution and condition is&#13;
lacking. There is also little information on the nature and importance of the threat being&#13;
posed to biodiversity in these forests, and the dynamics of change in forest cover&#13;
(deforestation and degradation). Some of the critical information that SRNyAH requires&#13;
for analysis and decision making would be generated by the inventory sub-component.&#13;
The objectives of the sub-component would be: (a) to complete an inventory of native&#13;
forests, including their biodiversity in carefully selected areas; and (b) to develop and&#13;
manage a related database so that SRNyAH would have the capacity to store, retrieve,&#13;
analyze and publish reliable information related to its mandate governing native forests.&#13;
2.9   The first objective of the sub-component would be pursued by completing a two-&#13;
phased inventory of native forests. Phase I (baseline costs US$1.9 million) would involve:&#13;
(a) the purchase of two sets of computer-compatible tapes of satellite imagery for the&#13;
entire area of Argentina, one at the beginning of the project, and the second toward the&#13;
end; (b) the preparation from an analysis of the first set of these tapes of a basic ecosystem&#13;
map for the entire country, which would be used, inter alia, to provide information on land&#13;
use, the broad distribution and extent of the principal ecosystems in the country, including&#13;
native forests and protected areas; and (c) the preparation from an analysis of the second&#13;
set of these tapes of a basic ecosystem map for the entire country with emphasis on native&#13;
forests and protected areas, which would form the foundation for monitoring changes in&#13;
native forests, other ecosystems and protected areas.&#13;
2.10  Phase 2 (baseline costs US$4.2 million) of the inventory of native forests would&#13;
first require that the approach and methodology for completing the inventory be agreed&#13;
between SRNyAH and other interested parties so that a standardized and technically&#13;
sound approach is adopted from the outset, one that would enable all data generated to be&#13;
efficiently incorporated and processed in the database. Internationally recruited&#13;
consultants (the lead consultant firm for both phases) would play a central role in this&#13;
undertaking, as would a workshop to elicit stakeholder participation and foster consensus&#13;
before the fieldwork is begun. Once the approach and methodology is agreed under Phase&#13;
2, and because Phase I would be proceeding in parallel, field work could begin once&#13;
sufficient progress has been made under Phase 1.&#13;
2.11   Phase 2 would involve systematic field sampling, or ground truthing, to verify&#13;
spectral signatures of different tree species on satellite images, to obtain more detailed&#13;
information on soils, slope, ownership, recent land use history, and habitat disturbance.&#13;
Biodiversity inventories would be carried out in carefully selected priority areas within the&#13;
five principal forest formations, namely, the Yungas, the Paranaense, the Chaco, the&#13;
Espinal and Sub-Antarctic Forests. These would be used to determine biodiversity indices&#13;
in these formations, assess species endemism, refine ecotype boundaries, measure species&#13;
dominance, define species hierarchies, describe habitat structures, assess degree of threat,&#13;
identify areas in need of protection, and monitor the dynamics of change over time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
2.12  In addition to generating raw data by carrying out the national inventory of native&#13;
forests, it is necessary that SRNyAH put in place a database system for processing this&#13;
data and transforming it into information that can be readily accessed by users (baseline&#13;
costs US$1.4 million). In addition to inputting data generated by the inventory, SRNyAH&#13;
would input into the database existing pertinent information available anywhere in&#13;
Argentina, including that available in the different parts of SRNyAH, SAPyA, the German&#13;
Technical Assistance Agency (GTZ), and the provinces. To some extent, at least, this&#13;
database would have to be custom designed to meet these requirements of SRNyAH, and&#13;
to help it fulfill its mandate as the lead federal agency dealing with native forests. The&#13;
present small statistics unit (3 persons) in DRFN would be transformed into a Database&#13;
Management Unit (DBMU) with responsibility for developing and managing this&#13;
SRNyAH database. This would require a substantial effort in institutional strengthening,&#13;
including training, so that this new DBMU would have the capacity to discharge its&#13;
responsibilities. An internationally recruited consultant firm (the lead firm) would put in&#13;
place the system and manage it while training the DBMU to take over.&#13;
2.13   The baseline cost of the sub-component would be US$7.5 million, and would&#13;
include expenditures for computer compatible tapes of satellite imagery, computer&#13;
hardware and software, vehicles, consultants, technical assistance, workshops and training.&#13;
At the provincial level, assistance would take the form of workshops to sharpen awareness&#13;
of the importance of collecting reliable data on native forests.&#13;
2.14  Applied Research and Studies to Facilitate the Improved Management and&#13;
Conservation of Native Forests (Baseline Costs US$5.0 million). The overall objective&#13;
of this sub-component would be to provide additional building blocks to SRNyAH in its&#13;
efforts to develop a strategy for discharging the federal responsibility toward native&#13;
forests. Based in particular on the information generated by the sub-component entitled&#13;
national inventory of native forests and establishment and operation of a related database,&#13;
SRNyAH would develop and manage an applied research and studies program to: (a)&#13;
identify the geographic areas of native forests most threatened with loss and destruction;&#13;
(b) select from the set of areas so identified the subset with the highest priority for&#13;
protection, (c) identify the principal forces leading to loss and destruction in the subset&#13;
with the highest priority for protection; and (d) develop and elaborate the options,&#13;
including, where feasible, a cost-benefit analysis for actions recommended, which&#13;
SRNyAH might exercise to improve the management of these priority areas, particularly&#13;
when all or part are privately owned.&#13;
2.15  Developing options for responding to threats in priority areas of native forests&#13;
raises difficult issues for SRNyAH because of the dearth of reliable information available&#13;
on appropriate responses. A particularly important challenge confronting SRNyAH is&#13;
how to effectively pursue its objectives in native forest areas where the land is privately&#13;
owned. Considering that most of the native forests of Argentina are privately owned, the&#13;
importance or this latter issue is apparent, and responding to it would be a focal area of&#13;
this applied research and studies sub-component. The Chaco region has been selected for&#13;
three principal reasons as the geographic region where SRNyAH would concentrate its&#13;
efforts to develop appropriate responses for improving the management of native forests&#13;
in areas where the land is privately owned: (a) the region's importance as an ecosystem;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(b) the importance of native forests in this ecosystem; and (c) the fact that most of the&#13;
native forest land there is privately owned.&#13;
2.16  The Chaco is the second largest vegetation type (after the Amazon) found in Latin&#13;
America, and occupies over one million km2 in four countries (Argentina has 46 percent&#13;
of the total area, Paraguay 32 percent, Bolivia 15 percent, and Brazil 7 percent). The&#13;
Chaco vegetation type is by far the largest forest/vegetation type in Argentina, where it&#13;
covers some 500,000 km2 ( 18 percent) of the total surface area of the country. Although&#13;
the Chaco region appears flat and uniform, it contains marshlands, palm savanna, several&#13;
varieties of grasslands, brushlands and thorn forests at higher elevations. The main forest&#13;
type of the Chaco region is the Parque Chaqueno, which is part of the Gran Chaco that&#13;
extends from Argentina to Bolivia and is characterized by low rainfall (600-1,000 mm per&#13;
year) and low deciduous forests.&#13;
2.17  The Chaco region's vegetation has been severely degraded over years of&#13;
mismanagement, especially overgrazing and unplanned tree harvesting. This has led to&#13;
desertification, soil erosion, and decreased infiltration, leading to increasing risks of&#13;
flooding, loss of wildlife habitat, and modifications in vegetation composition to the extent&#13;
that the existence of some tree species is endangered. While these problems are apparent&#13;
to the trained observer and are being felt by the local people who suffer economically from&#13;
their effects, there is surprisingly little solid information on the magnitude of the physical&#13;
and socio-economic impacts.&#13;
2.18  The primary objective of the applied research and studies program in the Chaco&#13;
region would be to develop the biodiversity, silvicultural and current use information,&#13;
management and payment mechanisms, and experience needed to encourage private&#13;
landowners to better manage and conserve its native forests. This objective is in line with&#13;
the government's priorities and objectives as it would support the initiative taken by&#13;
SRNyAH in drafting Decree Number 534/92, which establishes the principle that private&#13;
forest owners are entitled to compensation if they are required to take management&#13;
actions that decrease profits while providing public benefits. The ultimate aim would be to&#13;
establish an institutional capacity in SRNyAH which would enable it to act as an&#13;
information focal point and catalyst for uniting the provinces and the private sector in an&#13;
expanded effort to improve natural resource management and conservation in the Chaco&#13;
region.&#13;
2.19  One of the first tasks expected to be completed under this sub-component would&#13;
be a comprehensive study on the Chaco region, including socio-economic, ecological, land&#13;
use, and a review of the international experience in similar areas. A workshop would then&#13;
be held with all interested parties, including representatives of the provinces, in which the&#13;
findings and recommendations of the study would be discussed and a research program&#13;
and strategy developed. Concurrently, and with the information provided by the study and&#13;
workshop, an applied research and studies program would be developed aimed primarily&#13;
at: (a) generating economic, biological, ecological, and management information needed&#13;
for policy formulation, priority setting and decision making, both by the public and private&#13;
sectors; (b) developing technologies for improved management to protect environmental&#13;
values on-farm; (c) testing systems for making available to farmers, including indigenous&#13;
people, payments tied to the positive externalities produced by their improved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
management of native forests; and (d) developing monitoring and supervisory&#13;
mechanisms. Apart from the comprehensive study of the Chaco region, practically all the&#13;
research and studies funded in the Chaco region is expected to be on-farm applied&#13;
research. This is the research area most neglected to date, partly because it is more&#13;
difficult to complete successfully, but also because it is more demanding in terms of effort,&#13;
and yet probably less rewarding at the present time to individuals working at the National&#13;
Institute for Agricultural Research (INTA) or local universities.&#13;
2.20  The technical criteria which would guide the writing and appraisal of research and&#13;
study proposals for the Chaco region would be proposed by the SRNyAH and would&#13;
address the Chaco's main environmental problem: that of diminished production on-farm&#13;
of environmental goods and services, as well as loss of biodiversity, due to over harvesting&#13;
and grazing. Initially, such management techniques would, ideally, have been observed to&#13;
work in similar areas elsewhere in the world and would include a combination of: (a)&#13;
fencing to exclude or control grazing (control the intensity, time of grazing, and kind of&#13;
animal grazed); (b) manipulation of the vegetation through controlled burning, control of&#13;
weed species, mechanical control of species composition, and seeding or planting of&#13;
(preferably) indigenous multiple-use species, and (c) planned harvesting of timber species&#13;
so as to ensure sustainable residual stands of timber, livestock, and, most importantly,&#13;
biodiversity.&#13;
2.21  Outside the Chaco region, the focus of the applied research and studies program&#13;
would be on topics other than on-farm research. Since the amount of funding available&#13;
would be small relative to the size of the task, the focus of this sub-component in areas&#13;
lying outside the Chaco region would be on: (a) obtaining an improved understanding of&#13;
the general underlying forces adversely affecting priority areas of native forests for&#13;
protection (e.g., the subtropical humid forest of Misiones, the Selva Tucmana of the&#13;
northwest, and the Andino-Patagonico, Monte Occidental and Parque Pampeano-Puntano&#13;
forests); (b) elaborating the consequences for the country if such loss and destruction&#13;
continues unabated; (c) developing, where feasible, a cost-benefit analysis for each action&#13;
recommended, (d) collecting and analyzing information from around the world on best&#13;
practices in the management and conservation of native forests that are relevant to the&#13;
Argentine situation; and (e) such other topics as are agreed from time to time between the&#13;
Bank and SRNyAH.&#13;
2.22   Under this sub-component, SRNvAH would take the initiative and suggest topics&#13;
for study that it regarded as high priority. More generally, however, SRNyAH would rely&#13;
on a competitive system for generating research and study topics and ideas in order to&#13;
provide it with the opportunity to tap into the latest thinking in Argentina and elsewhere&#13;
on how best to respond to the challenges inherent in its mandate of improving the&#13;
management and conservation of native forests. This competitive system would provide&#13;
all interested researchers and consultants with tthe opportunity to compete for funding,&#13;
while leaving with SRNyAIFl the responsibility to allocate the available scarce funds wisely.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached that in awarding research and study contracts&#13;
SRNyAH would follow the selection criteria, approval process and form of contract&#13;
outlined in the Attachment of Annex B (para. 3.1 (b)). During negotiations, agreement&#13;
was also reached that a model form of research and study contract would be included in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
the draft Project Implementation Manual, which would be agreed at negotiations (para.&#13;
3.1 (c)).&#13;
2.23  The baseline cost of this sub-component would be US$5.0 million, and would&#13;
include expenditures for research and studies, as well as consultant services directly&#13;
related to the preparation and completion of research and study activities proposed by&#13;
SRNyAH. The sub-component would include: (a) US$0.5 million for a comprehensive&#13;
socio-economic, land-use, technical, and international comparison study of the Chaco&#13;
region; (b) US$0. 1 million for a workshop (including facilitator, meeting rooms, meals,&#13;
publications, travel) to develop a research and studies plan for the Chaco region; (c)&#13;
US$2.9 million for on-farm research and studies in the Chaco region; (d) US$0.05 million&#13;
for workshops to develop research and study plans for priority native forests elsewhere in&#13;
Argentina; and (e) US$1.45 million for carrying out research and studies in areas outside&#13;
the Chaco region. Only in exceptional cases is it expected that individual research and&#13;
study contracts would exceed US$250,000 over a six-year period.&#13;
Protected Areas Component&#13;
(Baseline Costs US$10.3 million)&#13;
2.24  The objectives of the Protected Areas Component would be: (a) to prepare a plan&#13;
for modernizing APN and transforming it into a world-class park management&#13;
organization; and (b) to increase the capacity of four national parks in Patagonia to&#13;
accommodate a greater number of tourists without damaging their environment. The&#13;
Protected Areas Component would comprise two sub-components: (a) the development&#13;
of a plan for the modernization of APN; and (b) specific infrastructure development and&#13;
management strengthening in four selected parks in the Patagonian region: Lanin, Nahuel&#13;
Huapi, Los Alerces, and Los Glaciares, as well as strengthening the Patagonia Regional&#13;
Technical Delegation (DTRP).&#13;
2.25  Under the modernization sub-component, the project would support studies and&#13;
activities aimed at developing and obtaining consensus on a vision, detailed blueprint, and&#13;
implementation plan for transforming APN into a world-class organization for managing&#13;
the Argentine national parks system. The sub-component would not, however, include&#13;
financing for implementing the plan because of the uncertainties and difficulties associated&#13;
with, inter alia, costing such an endeavor before it is agreed and designed.&#13;
2.26  An internationally selected lead consultant firm (including NGOs) would follow a&#13;
phased approach in completing its work under the modernization sub-component. The&#13;
most critical and difficult task confronting this consultant firm would be to arrive at a&#13;
consensus with the Argentine authorities and key stakeholders concerned on a vision for a&#13;
reformed APN that, if successfully implemented, would place APN among the handful of&#13;
best managed park systems in the world.&#13;
2.27  The lead consultant firm would present to the Argentine authorities (both in&#13;
writing and orally) the best options which are available based on experience from around&#13;
the world. Some of the critical questions to be addressed during this conceptual and&#13;
consensus building phase would include: (a) identification and listing of the individual&#13;
products/services produced by national parks in Argentina; (b) the pricing/subsidy policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
appropriate in a reformed APN for each product/service so identified; (c) based on the&#13;
above analysis, and drawing on the best experiences from around the world, what degree&#13;
of self-financing should be set as the goal for a reformed APN, both for recurrent&#13;
expenditures and capital items, and over what time period should the goal be achieved; (d)&#13;
considering the results of the above product/service and pricing analyses, and other factors&#13;
as appropriate, where on the private-public sector spectrum should a reformed APN&#13;
ideally lie, and what does this suggest about the appropriate legal mandate and charter for&#13;
a reformed APN; (e) what payment mechanisms should be used to compensate APN for&#13;
its provision of certain public goods and services; and (f) the broad outlines of the legal&#13;
mandate of a reformed APN, and the incentive system under which a reformed APN&#13;
should operate.&#13;
2.28   Once the vision is agreed, the next step would be to prepare the detailed blueprint&#13;
for this "vision of a reformed APN." Under this phase, the lead consultant firm would&#13;
design the core systems for a reformed APN (i.e., the legal, managerial, financial,&#13;
personal, contracting, including concessions, etc.). The last step included under this sub-&#13;
component would be for the lead consultant firm, working closely with APN and&#13;
SRNyAH and the Ministry of Economy, to prepare the plan to implement the proposed&#13;
blueprint.&#13;
2.29  The baseline costs of this sub-component have been estimated at US$0.8 million:&#13;
the main cost would be consulting services.&#13;
2.30  The other sub-component would finance specific infrastructure developments and&#13;
management strengthening in four selected parks in the Patagonian region: Lanin, Nahuel&#13;
Huapi, Los Alerces, and Los Glaciares, as well as strengthening the DTRP. The selection&#13;
of the parks which would be included under this sub-component was based on two main&#13;
criteria: (a) the tourism importance of these parks (mainly because of their scenic beauty&#13;
and sporting opportunities) within the national parks system and their potential to increase&#13;
revenues through the removal of infrastructure constraints; and (b) the presence of&#13;
representative institutional problems which, if effectively addressed under the project,&#13;
would provide useful input into the earlier sub-component dealing with the modernization&#13;
of APN. These parks were also selected because of their ecological importance and the&#13;
critical role they play in protecting the headwaters of the region's watersheds.&#13;
2.31   The four parks selected were among the earliest developed in Argentina (1934-&#13;
1937), and have substantial tourism-based infrastructure serving to increase their&#13;
attraction and accessibility. Because of the natural beauty and tourism attractions, these&#13;
four parks receive about 66 percent of the total number of visitors (1.2 million in 1995) to&#13;
the Argentine park system, and contribute about 33 percent of the total revenue generated&#13;
in the system in 1995. Notwithstanding this history, and despite the parks attractions and&#13;
existing infrastructure, there is growing concern that their tourism potential has not been&#13;
realized and that capture of visitor-generated revenue is highly inefficient.&#13;
2.32  The infrastructure investments in these selected parks would include access control&#13;
and information offices, which would allow for increased entrance fee capture; visitor&#13;
centers; mountain refuges for trekkers and for use by park guards while patrolling the&#13;
parks; observation points and trails; park guard housing; restoration of historical and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
cultural centers of attraction; and repair or building of roads. In general, development&#13;
sites within parks would increase tourism satisfaction and revenue capture. The sub-&#13;
component would also support improved management in the DTRP and the selected parks&#13;
through the funding of (a) vehicles and equipment (mainly radio communications and&#13;
computers); and (b) training seminars and short courses, attendance at conferences and&#13;
technical meetings, and training materials.&#13;
2.33  In line with APN regulations, an updated management plan would be prepared for&#13;
the proposed investment program in each selected park. For each park and specific&#13;
development site, APN would hold meetings with stakeholders and interest groups (i.e.,&#13;
provincial authorities, local people, concessionaires, recreational user groups, tourism&#13;
organizations and NGOs) to obtain their input prior to final approval of the proposed&#13;
investment program. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the consultative&#13;
process to be followed prior to approval of a management plan for any park included&#13;
under the Protected Areas Component would be included in the draft Project&#13;
Implementation Manual, which was agreed at negotiations (para. 3.1 (c)). During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was also reached that prior to the commencement of civil work&#13;
investments to be financed under the Protected Areas Component in any park, APN would&#13;
have an approved management plan for that park, which would be in accordance with&#13;
relevant Bank guidelines on Forestry and on Natural Habitats (para. 3.1 (d)). Further&#13;
details on this component are given in Annex C.&#13;
2.34  Under the mandate established in Law No 22.351 and resolution No. 16/94, the&#13;
screening process for classifying proposed park investments into one of three classes of&#13;
environmental impact, and the associated level of impact study required, is the&#13;
responsibility of APN and is outlined in an APN regulation, which is acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The key parts of the regulation are summarized in Annex C. A satisfactory&#13;
environmental study in accordance with the Borrowers legislation (Annex C) would be&#13;
required for all civil works as a condition of disbursement. The costs of the studies&#13;
required to satisfy the regulation are included in project costs.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
(Baseline Costs US$2.2 million)&#13;
2.35  This component would strengthen the capacity of DRFN and APN to manage and&#13;
coordinate project implementation by establishing a PIU which would assist the managers&#13;
of DRFN and APN in implementing the project. The PIU would comprise a Project&#13;
Coordinator, two Technical Managers (one for DRFN and one for APN), an Accountant&#13;
and other staff needed for the implementation of the project.&#13;
2.36  This component would also include a provision for vehicles and equipment&#13;
(telephones, photocopiers, fax machines and computers) of about US$180,000, and for&#13;
incremental operating costs for the PIU of about US$160,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
D. Associated GEF Biodiversity Conservation Project&#13;
2.37   A GEF-supported Biodiversity Conservation Project (GEF project) is expected to&#13;
be associated with the project. The overall objective of the associated GEF project would&#13;
be to support in Argentina the conservation of biodiversity of global significance within&#13;
the protected areas system. The GEF project would have three major components: (a)&#13;
Information Management for Protected Areas; (b) Protected Areas Management; and (c)&#13;
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. Preparation of GEF-eligible activities is&#13;
currently underway with support from the GEF, the FAO/CP and the Canadian Trust&#13;
Fund. A preparation grant (PDF Block B) of US$289,000, to support local preparation&#13;
activities, was approved by the GEF operations committee in February 1996. In May&#13;
1996 a PID was prepared and sent to the PIC.&#13;
2.38 Information Management for Globally Significant Protected Areas. This&#13;
component would aim to develop information systems as an important tool for the&#13;
monitoring of globally important sites. The databases developed under this component&#13;
would be linked to the database which would be established under the Bank-supported&#13;
project.&#13;
2.39   ProtectedAreasManagement. This component would create several new&#13;
protected areas in globally significant and unprotected ecosystems. It would include three&#13;
activities:&#13;
(a)   Creation of new protected areas. Under this activity, the GEF-supported&#13;
project would establish about five new national and/or provincial protected&#13;
areas in ecosystems of recognized global importance, but which are&#13;
currently poorly represented in the protected area system of Argentina and&#13;
LAC. A tentative list of the candidate sites includes the following:&#13;
Quebrada El Condorito, Pampa de Achala, and Mar Chiquita in C6rdoba;&#13;
Reserva San Guillermo in San Juan; Horco Molle, San Javier and&#13;
Anconquija in Tucuman; Talampaya in La Rioja; and Pampas grasslands in&#13;
Buenos Aires Province. An extensive stakeholder participation process&#13;
and consultations with federal and provincial institutions and&#13;
representatives of NGOs, indigenous peoples' organizations (where&#13;
appropriate), and universities has and will continue to play a central role in&#13;
determining creation and protection strategies. The component would also&#13;
finance demarcation and management plans and investments in&#13;
infrastructure and equipment to help ensure the sustainability of the new&#13;
protected areas;&#13;
(b)   Training. Under this activity, the GEF project would provide training to&#13;
strengthen key national and provincial government organizations involved&#13;
with the protection of sites of global importance. The training program&#13;
would be designed in close consultation with the University of Tucuman,&#13;
which already conducts training programs in protected area management&#13;
under an agreement with APN; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
(c)   Sustainable Use of Biodiversityfund. Under this activity, the GEF project&#13;
would finance the establishment of a fund which would provide small&#13;
grants, on a competitive basis, to NGOs, universities, and government&#13;
agencies (other than APN) for pilot initiatives and targeted research that&#13;
would contribute directly to the sustainable use of biodiversity in protected&#13;
areas and their buffer zones. Only initiatives in globally important sites&#13;
would be eligible and counterpart funding would be required.&#13;
2.40 GEF Project Management. Monitoring and Evaluation. This component would&#13;
include support for scientifically sound monitoring of biodiversity sites and for evaluation&#13;
of the GEF project results. These activities, including management support, will build&#13;
upon the related activities of the Bank-financed project.&#13;
E. Costs and Financing&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
2.41 Project baseline costs have been estimated at US$25.9 million. Physical&#13;
contingencies (US$0.9 million) and price contingencies (I 1.7 percent of baseline costs&#13;
plus physical contingencies) increase total project costs to US$30.0 million, including&#13;
taxes and duties which are estimated at about US$3.9 million. Project costs are shown&#13;
below in Table 1, with further details given in Annex E. The associated GEF project is&#13;
currently estimated to have a total incremental cost of about US$12.0 million, but this will&#13;
be examined more fully during final preparation and appraisal.&#13;

Project Financing&#13;
2.42   A Bank loan of US$19.5 million equivalent would finance about 75 percent of&#13;
total project costs, exclusive of taxes and duties. Bank financing would cover all the&#13;
foreign exchange expenditures of US$8.6 million, and about 51 percent of local costs.&#13;
Local cost financing is justified on project grounds because of the relatively high&#13;
proportion of project costs in local currencies and because of the inability of a new&#13;
institution to obtain more than a modest amount of project counterpart funds in the&#13;
present tight fiscal conditions prevailing in Argentina. Government would finance the&#13;
remaining US$10.5 million equivalent of total project costs. Details of counterpart&#13;
funding requirements, including a breakdown by year and by agency, are given in Annex E&#13;
(Table E. I 1). Retroactive financing of eligible expenditures made after Negotiations&#13;
would be permitted for an aggregate value up to 10 percent of the Loan amount&#13;
(US$1.95 million equivalent). Table I shows the project financing plan by component and&#13;
sub-component. Details on the allocation of the loan proceeds are shown in Annex F. It&#13;
is expected that the associated GEF project would be financed by a GEF grant of about&#13;
US$10.0 million and government counterpart funds of about US$2.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
F. Procurement and Disbursements&#13;
Procurement&#13;
2.43  During negotiations, agreement was reached that the procurement of goods and&#13;
services financed under the project would be undertaken in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised&#13;
January 1996) and Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981), using&#13;
standard documents, satisfactory to the Bank, for procurement of goods and works under&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB); and Standard Letters of Invitation (SLOI) and&#13;
standard forms of contract for consultant services (para. 3.1 (e)).&#13;
2.44  The review and approval of bid documents and procedures, including bid&#13;
evaluations and contract award proposals, would be the responsibility of the manager of&#13;
DRFN for DRFN-managed activities, and the manager of APN for APN-managed&#13;
activities. Each manager would be assisted in this endeavor by the PIU. A Country&#13;
Procurement Assessment Report for Argentina is scheduled for completion during 1996.&#13;
Because this would be the first project for which SRNyAH would be the principal&#13;
implementing agency, including having responsibility for all procurement, a procurement&#13;
consultant familiar with Bank procedures would be retained on a part-time basis to ensure&#13;
adherence to Bank's guidelines and procedures. Further details on procurement are&#13;
presented in Table 2.&#13;
2.45  Works. The procurement of works would consist of the construction of about 30&#13;
km of feeder roads, the rehabilitation of about 1 19 km of existing roads, the construction&#13;
of about 3,000 m2 of small buildings (park guard houses, visitor centers, control points,&#13;
volunteer housing, mountain refuges), the construction of five trails/observation points,&#13;
and the rehabilitation of two historical sites within the protected areas component.&#13;
Construction and road works would be dispersed in remote locations and are difficult to&#13;
package for International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Contracts for road work estimated&#13;
to cost a total of US$3.7 million would be bulked into packages valued at not less than&#13;
US$350,000 and awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB). All other&#13;
construction and rehabilitation work would be small in value (i.e., less than US$350,000)&#13;
and undertaken through lump-sum, fixed-price contracts, awarded on the basis of three&#13;
quotations.&#13;
2.46 During negotiations, agreement was reached that all bidding documents and&#13;
contracts for road works under the Protected Areas Component would incorporate an&#13;
environmental manual acceptable to the Bank, said manual to include, inter alia: (i) the&#13;
applicable environmental and natural resource legislation and regulations; (ii) explicit&#13;
prohibitions and environmental behavior guidelines for work crews, especially for work in&#13;
sensitive areas; (iii) procedures for proper selection and management of quarries, borrow&#13;
pits, gravel extraction along rivers, and other sources of construction material, and&#13;
eventual rehabilitation of affected areas through soil replacement and revegetation; (iv)&#13;
procedures for selection of camp sites, management of camp wastes, and guidelines for&#13;
camp dismantling and abandonment; (v) procedures for proper disposal of excavated earth&#13;
and spoil material to avoid contaminating streams or causing other unnecessary damage;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
and (vi) procedures for proper disposal of waste from construction machinery and&#13;
equipment (para. 3.1(f)). During negotiations, agreement was also reached that the&#13;
environmental manual would be included in the draft Project Implementation Manual,&#13;
which was agreed at negotiations (para. 3.1 (c)).&#13;
2.47  Goods. The size of the contracts involved in the procurement of goods would be&#13;
such that they could not be grouped into packages large enough to justify ICB.&#13;
Therefore, the following procurement procedures would be used. To the extent possible,&#13;
contracts for goods would be bulked into packages valued at not less than US$ 100,000&#13;
and awarded on the basis of NCB, up to an aggregate amount of US$700,000. Contracts&#13;
for equipment (e.g., computers and software, communications equipment, transmission&#13;
towers, vehicles, boats, and office, audio visual, research and training equipment) valued&#13;
at less than US$100,000, would be awarded on the basis of international or national&#13;
shopping. All procurement using these shopping procedures would not exceed an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1.1 million. Satellite images (computer-compatible tapes),&#13;
which are estimated to cost about US$1.1 million, would be procured by direct&#13;
contracting because they are proprietary and obtainable only from one source once a&#13;
technical choice is made between the various systems available. Contracts for the&#13;
procurement of vehicles, boats, technical equipment, and computer hardware and software&#13;
would be awarded to agents or vendors with appropriate after-sales services, maintenance&#13;
facilities and spare-parts supplies. All vehicles and boats procured (about 20) would&#13;
include a four-year service contract.&#13;
2.48  Consultinz Services. Studies, which would cost about US$500,000 in consultant&#13;
fees, would include analyses of policies, laws and regulations for native forests. Technical&#13;
assistance, which would cost about US$8. 1 million in consultant fees, would include: (a)&#13;
development of a database on native forest; (b) implementation of a native forest&#13;
inventory; and (c) development of a plan to modernize APN. Training, which would cost&#13;
about US$300,000 in consultant fees, would include the provision of on-the-job training&#13;
as well as local short courses and seminars in database management and park&#13;
management. Project management, which would cost about US$1.7 million in consultant&#13;
fees, would include the consultant services required for the PIU to assist with project&#13;
implementation. Of the total costs of consulting fees, it is estimated that about US$3.6&#13;
million would be awarded to internationally recruited consultants, and the balance (about&#13;
US$ 7.0 million) to locally recruited consultants. In Table 2, consultant expenses other&#13;
than fees and international travel costs (e.g., domestic travel and subsistence) are included&#13;
under the "Other Expenditures" heading.&#13;
2.49  Research and Studies. Research and study contracts, estimated to cost up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$5.4 million, would be procured following the selection and&#13;
approval process described in the Attachment to Annex B.&#13;

2.50  Bank Review. During negotiations, agreement was reached that, regarding&#13;
procurement, the process of Bank review outlined here would be followed (para. 3.1 (g)).&#13;
All procedures, documents, Terms of Reference (TOR), bid evaluations, and contract&#13;
awards would be subject to prior review by the Bank for: (a) procurement of works under&#13;
NCB; (b) contracts under small works (i.e., three quotations) procedures where contracts&#13;
are over US$150,000; (c) procurement of goods under NCB; (d) direct contracting of the&#13;
purchase of satellite images; and (e) procurement of consulting services costing&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent or more for firms and US$30,000 equivalent or more for&#13;
individuals. The review thresholds proposed above provide for prior review by the Bank&#13;
of approximately 52 percent of the total value of Bank-financed contracts . In addition, the&#13;
first five research and study contracts, and thereafter all such contracts greater than&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent, would be subject to prior review by the Bank. The Bank would&#13;
review on an ex-post sample basis all other contracts awarded under shopping procedures;&#13;
the sample size would aim to ensure that at least one contract in 20 would be examined.&#13;
For research and study contracts costing less than US$ 100,000 equivalent, a copy of all&#13;
signed contracts and related financial and technical audits and evaluations would be sent to&#13;
the Bank, and at least 20 percent would be subjected to ex-post review. For consulting&#13;
services costing less than US$50,000 equivalent for firms and less than US$30,000&#13;
equivalent for individuals, contracts would be signed based on a model contract and terms&#13;
of reference previously agreed with the Bank. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that the draft TOR for consultants, and a SLOI and standard form of contract,&#13;
would be included in the draft Project Implementation Manual, which was agreed at&#13;
negotiations (para. 3.1 (c)) and finalized, with draft TORs, before effectiveness (para.&#13;
3.2).&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
2.51   Loan proceeds would be disbursed over eight years, in line with the standard&#13;
disbursement profile for Bank-supported projects in Argentina. Therefore, the project is&#13;
expected to be completed by December 31, 2004 and the Closing Date would be June 30,&#13;
2005. The allocation of the proposed loan and the disbursement percentages are&#13;
presented in Annex F. A Special Account for Bank disbursements would be established in&#13;
the Banco de la Naci6n Argentina with an authorized allocation of US$790,000&#13;
equivalent. The initial deposit in the Special Account would be US$370,000 equivalent;&#13;
the full authorized allocation would be deposited once the amount of Bank disbursements&#13;
reaches US$3.0 million equivalent. The Special Account should be used for all payments&#13;
less than 20 percent of the Authorized Allocation. Applications for replenishment of the&#13;
Special Account should be submitted on a monthly basis or more frequently if the amount&#13;
withdrawn from the Special Account exceeds one-third of its value. Disbursements for all&#13;
contracts below the prior review limit would be made on the basis of Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOE). The relevant documentation in support of SOE would be retained by&#13;
SRNyAH, and would be made available to the appropriate auditors and Bank review&#13;
missions. All other expenditures would be fully documented. The Bank's approval of the&#13;
relevant environmental studies for civil works under the Protected Areas Component&#13;
would be a condition of disbursement for these civil works under the proposed loan (para.&#13;
3.3). The estimated schedule of Bank loan disbursements is shown in Annex G.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
G. Organization and Implementation&#13;
Project Management&#13;
2.52  Overall responsibility for project implementation would rest with SRNyAH, and&#13;
authority to make most decisions affecting the project would be delegated to the manager&#13;
of DRFN for the Research and Information Generation and Dissemination Component,&#13;
and the manager of APN for the Protected Areas Component. The two managers would&#13;
make maximum use of existing SRNyAH capacity for project implementation but, in&#13;
addition, would receive administrative and technical assistance from the PIU which would&#13;
be established under the project.&#13;
2.53  The PIU would include as core staff&#13;
(a)   A Project Coordinator, who would be recruited locally for the duration of&#13;
the project, would be responsible for, inter alia: (i) the coordination of&#13;
implementation both in DRFN and APN; (ii) putting in place, and&#13;
maintaining, a system for monitoring project implementation; (iii)&#13;
coordinating the preparation of annual work programs ("POAs"), bi-annual&#13;
progress reports to the Bank, and the production of audit reports; (iv)&#13;
supervising the administration of the Special Account; (v) preparing, in&#13;
cooperation with the Technical Managers, all documents for the Mid-Term&#13;
Review and ensuring their quality; and (vi) completing, in cooperation with&#13;
the Technical Managers, in particular, an evaluation of the Project at the&#13;
end of its life. He/she would ultimately be the link between Bank&#13;
supervision staff and DRFN and APN;&#13;
(b)   Two Technical Managers, who would be recruited locally for the&#13;
duration of the project, would be responsible for ensuring the technical&#13;
quality of all project work under their respective areas of responsibility,&#13;
namely, DRFN and APN, and, in cooperation with the Project&#13;
Coordinator, for preparing the required documentation for the Mid-Term&#13;
Review, and for preparing the project evaluation report at the end of the&#13;
project's life; and&#13;
(c)   An Accountant, who would be recruited locally for the duration of the&#13;
project, would be responsible for financial record keeping, the Special&#13;
Account, and disbursement requests; and other part-time technical and&#13;
administrative consultants as needed for project implementation, such as:&#13;
(d)   A Procurement Specialist, who would be recruited locally for a total of&#13;
about 20 months spread over six years, would be responsible for ensuring&#13;
that procurement procedures follow Bank guidelines and for making&#13;
recommendations on award of contracts to the managers of DRFN and&#13;
APN;&#13;
(e)   A Statistician, who would be recruited internationally for about 20 months&#13;
spread over six years, would be responsible for ensuring the statistical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
soundness of all research and study work carried out by DRFN under the&#13;
project. The Statistician would be selected for his/her qualifications and&#13;
experience in the design and implementation of on-farm research either in&#13;
Argentina or elsewhere; and&#13;
(f)    An Economist, who would be recruited locally for almost the duration of&#13;
the Project, would be responsible for ensuring the quality and completeness&#13;
of the work under the sub-component dealing with reform of the policy,&#13;
legal and regulatory framework affecting native forests, the sub-component&#13;
dealing with the modernization of APN, and, more generally, for the&#13;
quality of all economic work under the project, including the design of&#13;
research and study proposals in the Chaco region on privately owned&#13;
property. The Economist would be selected for his/her qualifications and&#13;
experience in environmental and natural resource economics and their&#13;
linkages to the efficient working of the overall economy.&#13;
2.54  The establishment of the PIU and the appointment of a Project Coordinator, two&#13;
Technical Managers, and an Accountant, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (para. 3.2).&#13;
2.55 DRFN and APN would be delegated responsibility by SRNyAH for the&#13;
implementation of those parts of the proposed project falling under their respective&#13;
mandates. Consequently, DRNF would have responsibility for the implementation of the&#13;
Research and Information Generation and Dissemination Component, while APN would&#13;
have responsibility for the implementation of the Protected Areas Component.&#13;
2.56  Under the Generation and Dissemination of Research and Information&#13;
Component, DRFN would implement the sub-component dealing with the reform of the&#13;
policy, legal and regulatory framework affecting native forests by recruiting consulting&#13;
firms and/or individual consultants to complete the task.&#13;
2.57  Under the Generation and Dissemination of Research and Information Component,&#13;
DRFN would implement the sub-component dealing with the National Inventory of Native&#13;
Forests and Management of a Related Database by recruiting a lead consultant firm which&#13;
would complete Phase I of the inventory, design and obtain agreement to the approach&#13;
and methodology for completing Phase 2, prepare an inventory manual, manage the&#13;
carrying out of the inventory in the field, and exercise quality control. It is expected that&#13;
DRFN would recruit local consultants to complete the actual detailed field inventory&#13;
work. The country would be divided along ecosystem lines, with the inventory work in&#13;
each region completed under different local consultant contracts. Regarding the&#13;
management of a related database, an internationally recruited lead consultant firm would&#13;
put in place the system and manage it until the DBMiU is capable of taking over.&#13;
2.58  Under the Generation and Dissemination of Research and Information Component,&#13;
DRFN would implement the sub-component dealing with Applied Research and Studies to&#13;
Facilitate the Improved Management and Conservation of Native Forests by using the&#13;
services of researchers and consultants who may be qualified individuals, firms,&#13;
universities, public or private research entities, or NGOs from Argentina or elsewhere. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
substantial part of the applied research and studies, particularly that in the Chaco region,&#13;
would be collaborative in nature and would involve landowners, NGOs, universities,&#13;
INTA, the ministry of agriculture and natural resources of participating provinces, and&#13;
other government agencies.&#13;
2.59  Under the Protected Areas Component, the Modernization of APN sub-&#13;
component would be managed directly by the senior management of APN in Buenos Aires&#13;
with assistance from the PIU, particularly the Economist. Every effort would be made to&#13;
seek the views of other interested parties in the federal government, provincial&#13;
governments, the private sector and NGOs.&#13;
2.60  APN would delegate authority for the management of the infrastructure investment&#13;
and management strengthening program in the four selected parks, as well as the&#13;
strengthening of the DTRP, to the superintendencies of each selected park and the&#13;
managers of the DTRP. The DTRP would work closely with the superintendencies to&#13;
achieve the objectives of the sub-component, and would receive technical and&#13;
administrative assistance from the PIU, particularly from the Technical Manager assigned&#13;
to APN.&#13;
Monitoring, Supervision and Evaluation&#13;
2.61  During negotiations, agreement was reached on the Schedule of Monitoring&#13;
Indicators (Annex H) and the Supervision Plan (Annex I), which includes a Mid-Term&#13;
Review (para. 3.1 (h)).&#13;
2.62  The responsibility for project monitoring, which is a task inseparable from effective&#13;
project management, would rest with the managers of DRFN and APN, who would be&#13;
assisted in completing this task by the Project Coordinator. Project evaluation would also&#13;
be the responsibility of these managers, who would be assisted in completing this task by&#13;
both the Project Coordinator and the Technical Managers. These responsibilities would&#13;
be detailed in the draft Project Implementation Manual, on which agreement was reached&#13;
at negotiations (para. 3. 1 (c)).&#13;
2.63  Reporting requirements would be designed to assist with the submission to the&#13;
Bank of annual and semi-annual progress reports, the Mid-Term Review, and the ex-post&#13;
evaluation of the project, namely, the ICR. Project performance indicators and measures&#13;
of project impact (Annex H) would guide possible mid-course adjustments. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was also reached that a Mid-Term Review would be carried out&#13;
by November 2000, focusing in particular on progress being made in reaching a consensus&#13;
on reforming the policy, legal, and regulatory framework affecting native forests, and in&#13;
preparing the modernization plan for APN (para. 3.1 (1)).&#13;
Accounts, Audit and Reporting&#13;
2.64 Under the overall direction of the managers of the DRFN and APN, the PIU would&#13;
maintain separate project accounts and records for each project component and sub-&#13;
component and prepare SOEs. Supporting documents provided by the various entities&#13;
concerned would be maintained by the PIU and made available to visiting Bank missions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
and independent auditors, who on their judgment would make field visits to entities&#13;
concerned for the purpose of the overall audit. A standard chart of accounts would be&#13;
prepared for the project.&#13;
2.65  Project accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, would be audited&#13;
annually in accordance with appropriate auditing principles and practices. The audit TOR&#13;
would be included in the draft Project Implementation Manual, which would be agreed&#13;
during negotiations (para. 3.1 (c)), and would, inter alia, ask the auditors to: (i) certify that&#13;
procurement had been carried out using bidding documents agreed with the Bank, (ii)&#13;
certify that procurement documents presented to the Bank for prior review were&#13;
representative; and (iii) carry out a physical audit of procurement actions taken under the&#13;
project. Agreement was also reached during negotiations that the Borrower would hire&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and that certified copies of their audits&#13;
would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year&#13;
(para. 3.1 (i)).&#13;
2.66  During negotiations, agreement was reached that SRNyAH would present to the&#13;
Bank for review and comment, no later than June 30 each year, the draft POA for the&#13;
project for the following calendar year (para. 3.1 (j)). During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
also reached that at the end of each year SRNyAH would produce a Progress Report for&#13;
the project, and in the middle of each year an Interim Progress Report, for submission to&#13;
the Bank; these would be provided to the Bank not later than January 31 and July 31,&#13;
respectively (para. 3.1 (k)). The Progress Reports would provide the basic information&#13;
and data for supervision missions and the Mid-Term Review.&#13;
H. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.67  The proposed project is fully supportive of the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS), which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on May 4, 1995. The&#13;
CAS highlights three broad objectives: (a) consolidating structural reform; (b) reducing&#13;
poverty and strengthening social services, and (c) rebuilding infrastructure. The proposed&#13;
project would be the Bank's first free-standing project aimed at improved management and&#13;
conservation of native forests and protected areas in Argentina. It would provide a&#13;
vehicle for the Bank to pursue CAS objective (c) above by improving environmental&#13;
management and protection. It would pursue this objective by enhancing the policy, legal&#13;
and regulatory framework governing native forests, by addressing information constraints&#13;
to sustainable use of native forests and conservation of biodiversity, and by supporting the&#13;
modernization of APN as a national parks management entity. Bank support for this&#13;
project would make possible the formulation of an integrated and balanced approach to&#13;
improved management and conservation of native forests in Argentina, and therefore also&#13;
providing the foundation for proposed GEF-conservation activities focused on areas of&#13;
global significance.&#13;
I. Program Objective Categories&#13;
2.68  The program objective categories which would be affected by this project are&#13;
environmentally sustainable development, and natural resource management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
J. Benefits, Risks and Environmental Impact&#13;
Benefits&#13;
2.69  The project would begin the process of addressing native forest management&#13;
issues in a comprehensive and coherent manner. For example, in the applied research&#13;
work on private lands in the Chaco region, the long-term aim would be to establish an&#13;
institutional capacity in SRNyAH which would enable it to act as an information focal&#13;
point and a catalyst for uniting the provinces and the private sector in an expanded effort&#13;
to improve natural resource management and conservation in that region. As a result of&#13;
the project, Argentina would be better positioned to continue the process of managing its&#13;
native forests and protected areas by virtue of the increased quantity and improved quality&#13;
of information that would be available, and the strengthened protected area system and&#13;
improved incentives which it would be capable of putting in place. Improvement in the&#13;
management of the protected areas system, development of visitor infrastructure and&#13;
formulation of tourism strategies would increase opportunities for cost recovery and&#13;
revenue-earning activities in local communities without threatening the stability of the&#13;
ecosystem. Tourism plans would analyze the carrying capacity of fragile ecosystems to&#13;
ensure that sustainability is not threatened. The rural economy would be strengthened due&#13;
to the increased tourism as a result of a better-managed parks system. This boost to the&#13;
rural economy gives some balance between addressing environmental values and more&#13;
direct economic activities, particularly in rural areas. This project would also lay the&#13;
foundation for the associated GEF project which would contribute to the conservation of&#13;
biodiversity of global significance.&#13;
Risks&#13;
2.70  The major risks and uncertainties include the danger that the institutions charged&#13;
with executing the project would not be up to the task, and that the government&#13;
commitment of funds to achieve long-term goals would not be sustainable in the face of&#13;
short-term fiscal stringencies. Regarding the former, strong emphasis would be placed on&#13;
strengthening the project implementation capacity of DRFN and APN as part of the&#13;
project, and for the latter, the fiscal implications of the project would be clearly elaborated&#13;
in the preparation documents and government commitment sought. More specifically: (a)&#13;
the limited capacity of SRNyAH, including APN, to manage project implementation&#13;
would be addressed by the establishment of a PIU to support the carrying out of project&#13;
administration, and by contracting consultants, NGOs, and universities to avoid the need&#13;
to increase staff, and (b) the possibility of inadequate counterpart funds to finance&#13;
recurrent costs on the part of participating parks would be addressed over the medium-to&#13;
long-term under the modernization of APN sub-component, which would emphasize the&#13;
importance of individual national parks availing themselves of every opportunity to be self&#13;
financing.. The incremental recurrent cost after project completion would be modest at&#13;
about US$0.6 million per annum (further details are given in Annex E).&#13;
2.71  Project sustainability would be enhanced through the reform of the policy, legal&#13;
and regulatory framework that affects native forests. Research-generated information&#13;
would make possible more efficient programs to protect native forests, which, in turn,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
would make such activities more sustainable. Because SRNyAH has an ongoing&#13;
institutional strengthening project with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),&#13;
partially financed with a US$30 million loan, the overall capacity of this institution should&#13;
be strengthened, thus improving the likelihood of the proposed project being sustainable.&#13;
The sub-component to modernize APN has the potential, over the medium- to long-term,&#13;
to place that institution on a financially self-sustaining basis.&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
2.72 Under the mandate established in Law No 22.351 and resolution No. 16/94, APN&#13;
is responsible for environmental review and assessment associated with relevant&#13;
interventions in any protected area under its jurisdiction, including the construction and&#13;
maintenance of public services and tourist infrastructure. Accordingly, prior to APN&#13;
commencing the implementation of any construction, trails, or road works under this&#13;
project, an environmental impact assessment (in the case of new roads), or an&#13;
environmental impact report (for other works) would be prepared. Where indigenous&#13;
people might be affected, the analysis, and associated participatory process, would&#13;
specifically address possible impacts and identify actions to ensure that management plans&#13;
are compatible with their cultural preferences. There would be no involuntary&#13;
resettlement under the project. The project has an Environmental Assessment category B&#13;
because infrastructure in protected areas could damage natural habitat and because of the&#13;
need to ensure that reform of the policy, legal and regulatory framework affecting native&#13;
forests would avoid negative consequences for the environment.&#13;

(k)   at the end of each fiscal year, SRNyAH would produce a Progress Report&#13;
for the project, and in the middle of each year an Interim Progress Report,&#13;
for submission to the Bank; these would be provided to the Bank no later&#13;
than January 31 and July 31, respectively (para. 2.66);&#13;
(I)    a Mid-Term Review would be carried out by November 2000, focusing in&#13;
particular on progress being made in reaching a consensus on reforming the&#13;
policy, legal, and regulatory framework affecting native forests, and in&#13;
preparing the modernization plan for APN (para. 2.63).&#13;
3.2   The establishment of the PIU and the appointment of a Project Coordinator, two&#13;
Technical Managers, and an Accountant, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
and the completion of the Project Implementation Manual, with draft TORs, would be&#13;
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan (paras. 2.50 and 2.54).&#13;
3.3   The Bank's approval of the relevant environmental studies for civil works under&#13;
the Protected Areas Component would be a condition of disbursement for these civil&#13;
works under the proposed loan (para. 2.51).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
3.4   Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the proposed project would be&#13;
suitable for a Bank loan of US$19.5 million equivalent, repayable in 15 years, including 5&#13;
years of grace, with loan amortization based on level repayments of principal, at the&#13;
Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;

NATIVE FORESTS AND PROTECTED AREAS PROJECT&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous Related Bank Lending&#13;
1.    The management of natural resources and the strengthening of institutions are two&#13;
critical, interdependent ways in which governments can ensure the sustainability of&#13;
economic development. The adoption and financing of an environmentally sound resource&#13;
management strategy is unlikely to succeed without the managerial, technical and&#13;
operational support of efficient institutions.&#13;
Lessons from Bankwide Experience&#13;
2.    OED has evaluated several hundred completed Bank projects with&#13;
forestry/environment and institutional objectives and has derived broad-based&#13;
recommendations for future lending. OED has concluded that natural resource advice&#13;
should be a central element in the design of sustainable country strategies and&#13;
development programs, and the Bank should help countries incorporate environmental&#13;
concerns into macroeconomic planning. The basis for this advice should be sector work&#13;
which stresses sustainable development as a matter of economic efficiency, identifies a set&#13;
of policy options, defines informational needs for improved planning and policymaking,&#13;
and provides a strong operational foundation for Bank lending. The recent Forestry&#13;
Sector Review for Argentina (Report No. 11833-AR, dated April 26, 1993) meets these&#13;
requirements. It has been discussed with Government and is a key reference for the&#13;
Government's evolving forestry/natural resource conservation strategy.&#13;
3.    The Bank should assist governments to assess the trade-offs, if any, between&#13;
growth, equity, and sustainability, an effort which requires strong technical criteria based&#13;
on research, natural resource inventories, and information and database development to&#13;
establish the benefits of resource conservation and to design appropriate growth-related or&#13;
environmental incentives. OED cites the importance of the incentive structure in natural&#13;
resource strategies; personal benefits must be evident, understandable, and fairly imminent.&#13;
A LAC study on deforestation in Costa Rica (1992) showed that forest protection for&#13;
example, will rarely be a competitive use of forest resources for private agents unless they&#13;
are paid for potential income foregone, a principle which research will determine may well&#13;
apply to a variety of habitat. The idea of compensation is also raised in OED's&#13;
comprehensive Forestry Development: A Review of Bank Experience (1991). The&#13;
participation of local people in designating protected areas may require compensating&#13;
them, while revenue raising schemes for their benefit might increase their acceptance and&#13;
decrease the enforcement burden.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -                            Annex A&#13;
4.    OED analysis shows that institutional weaknesses have seriously undermined the&#13;
more complex collaborative arrangements usually needed in environmental forestry&#13;
projects due to their multi-purpose nature. However, few of the many Bank-financed&#13;
institution-strengthening components have had lasting effects, a major concern given the&#13;
increasing complexity of projects and the diversity of the demands being placed on&#13;
institutions. OED concludes that the nature, structure and operational effectiveness of&#13;
institutions are a critical determinant of the impact of environmental forestry projects, and&#13;
that this is likely to intensify in the 1990s as political pressure is exerted on environmental&#13;
and forestry institutions to broaden their agendas to incorporate protection, management,&#13;
biodiversity and conservation.&#13;
5.    Several OED analyses of Bank technical assistance for institution-building&#13;
conclude that success entails: a high level of commitment and mutual interest on the part&#13;
of borrower and donor; project design which capitalizes on existing opportunities and&#13;
forms part of a well-defined, economic and sector work (ESW) based institutional&#13;
development plan; concentrating on technical, managerial and administrative systems&#13;
development; attention to legal and regulatory issues governing both the relevant natural&#13;
resource subsectors and the powers, functions and responsibilities of the institutions&#13;
themselves; and decentralization of planning, policy and implementation to state and local&#13;
authorities, limiting central government responsibilities to normative, enforcement and&#13;
administrative functions.&#13;
6.    Lessons from specific projects corroborate the above. The Brazil National&#13;
Environment Project (Ln. 3173-BR) is confirming the need for: a thorough institutional&#13;
analysis early on; greater attention to institutional capacity building lest undue reliance has&#13;
to be placed on the project coordinating unit and technical experts, thus reducing the&#13;
institutional benefits of the project; more strategically oriented, simple project design, and&#13;
rational sequencing of project activities. The recent restructuring of this project stresses&#13;
new, decentralized approaches to environmental management, including the use of market-&#13;
based incentives. Equally germane are the Rond6nia and Mato Grosso Natural Resource&#13;
Management Projects (Ln. 3444-BR and 3492-BR) currently being implemented. Both&#13;
projects contain institution strengthening, and decentralization of environmental policy to&#13;
the municipalities. Experience points to the importance of strong environmental agencies&#13;
at the state level and of timely consultation with a broad variety of entities, especially on&#13;
zoning issues. Institutional development should also include analysis of the legal&#13;
framework and agencies' internal managerial and organizational capacities.&#13;
Lessons of Native Forest Management in LAC&#13;
7.    Lessons learned from native forest management projects in LAC have prompted a&#13;
shift away from forests as purely a revenue generating resource to the view that forest&#13;
lands are capable of being managed for multiple outputs, including environmental services.&#13;
A LAC paper, Prospects for Improved Management of Natural Forests in Latin America&#13;
(1993), sets out the impediments and suggests solutions. While the technical feasibility of&#13;
improved native forest management in LAC has been demonstrated, important constraints&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-                              Annex A&#13;
have limited its implementation, namely: weak research information and databases for&#13;
decision making; contradictory policies which create perverse incentives to destroy&#13;
forests; failure to involve local communities in forest management schemes; lack of&#13;
profitability and political will, and land invasions, causing abandonment of otherwise viable&#13;
management systems; and weak, overcentralized institutions.&#13;
8.    According to this study, improved management of native forests should include:&#13;
the use of existing technology including detailed inventories of natural forest and&#13;
biodiversity; research and information dissemination including on the ecosystem, the&#13;
supply of environmental services and biodiversity; financial incentives; providing incentives&#13;
to local communities to protect forests; reform of institutions including decentralization of&#13;
decision making and fiscal authority, and reform of the regulatory framework to reflect&#13;
environmental values; and participatory approaches in project preparation and execution.&#13;
Bank Lending Experience in Argentina&#13;
9.    The current lending portfolio in Argentina comprises 19 loans, mainly in the&#13;
infrastructure and finance sectors, totaling US$5.4 billion. The Bank has undertaken five&#13;
operations in the agricultural sector, several of which indirectly sought natural resource&#13;
conservation benefits (e.g., use of credit to buy modern farm machinery with soil&#13;
conservation features) but the proposed project would be the first Bank investment in&#13;
native forests and protected areas in Argentina and thus there are no lessons from previous&#13;
efforts. Periodic economic and sectoral crises and profound institutional weaknesses have&#13;
been a daunting context for Bank project planning and execution especially in the 1980s,&#13;
affecting commitment and counterpart funding, implementation schedules, and the ability&#13;
to develop a longer-term strategic perspective and sustain project benefits. However,&#13;
recent macroeconomic reforms, greater awareness of environmental degradation and the&#13;
potential benefits of sound resource management, and Bank sector work, have paved the&#13;
way for new projects in forestry, industrial pollution control and solid waste management,&#13;
flood protection, biodiversity conservation and global warming.&#13;
Project Strategy&#13;
10.   The proposed project complements the Forest Development Project (Ln. 3948-&#13;
AR), constructing a programmatic approach to the management and conservation of&#13;
Argentina's native forests. It heeds relevant lessons of Bank and non-Bank experience and&#13;
studies, addressing institutional deficiencies, information needs, and prioritizing expansion&#13;
and consolidation of protected areas. It would consolidate selected national parks,&#13;
facilitating tourism through road construction and rehabilitation, and demarcation&#13;
activities. Multiple use native forest management, e.g., tourism, logging and&#13;
environmental benefits, would be tested.&#13;
11.   Acknowledging the critical need for a better knowledge base for&#13;
forest/environmental decision making, the project would support native forest inventories.&#13;
Research within the Chaco region would attempt to devise a workable compensation&#13;

mechanism for private owners to induce them to produce environmental goods and&#13;
benefits on private land in a unique region. The objective is to be able to demonstrate&#13;
technically and methodologically, the environmental response associated with financial&#13;
inducements, and to quantify that response. Outside the Chaco region, research would&#13;
stress efficient and effective ways of protecting the natural habitat and biodiversity.&#13;
Finally, the project would strengthen the SRNyAH and the APN, in preparation for an&#13;
increasingly complex role in environmental and forestry management and policy-setting,&#13;
through analysis of the legal and regulatory context affecting native forest management,&#13;
personnel training and monitoring and evaluation systems.&#13;

A. Sub-Component: Reform of the Policy, Legal and Regulatory Framework&#13;
Affecting Native Forests (Baseline Costs US$0.9 million)&#13;
I1.    The policy, legal and regulatory framework affecting native forests has many&#13;
weaknesses which must be addressed as one of the first steps in any strategy to improve&#13;
their management in Argentina. Under this sub-component the following actions would be&#13;
taken:&#13;
(a)   At the Federal Level:&#13;
(i)   Study of policies, laws and regulations at the federal level&#13;
(US$140,000). Detailed study of existing federal legislation and&#13;
regulations affecting the use and conservation of native forests, and&#13;
the identification of the main obstacles to their efficient protection,&#13;
including the internalization of environmental values in private and&#13;
public decision making. This item would include six person/months&#13;
(p/m) of an internationally recruited economist, six p/m of a&#13;
national economist, 6 p/m of a national environmentalist, and four&#13;
p/m of a national lawyer;&#13;
(ii)   Workshops for prioritizing federal obstacles (US$40.000).&#13;
Workshops for consultations with the public and private sectors,&#13;
and NGOs on the policy and regulatory constraints at the federal&#13;
level. The objectives of the workshops would be to obtain&#13;
feedback on the results of the above study, to agree on a hierarchy&#13;
of problems, and to prioritize obstacles to be removed. Costs&#13;
include a facilitator and travel expenses;&#13;
Drafting revised federal legislation and regulations (US$50,000). Drafting legal&#13;
documents and regulations, following the priorities agreed in (a) (ii). This would be done&#13;
using about 10 p/m of local lawyers;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(b)   At the Provincial Level:&#13;
(i)    Study of policies, laws and regulations at the provincial level&#13;
(US$250.00!). Detailed study of existing provincial legislation and&#13;
regulations affecting the use and conservation of native forests and&#13;
the management of protected areas, and the identification of the&#13;
main obstacles to their efficient protection, including the&#13;
internalization of environmental values in private and public&#13;
decision making. This item would include 10 p/m of an&#13;
international economist, 22 p/m of national&#13;
economists/environmentalists/researchers, and 8 p/m of a national&#13;
lawyer;&#13;
(ii)   Workshops for consultation with provinces (US$70.000).&#13;
Workshops for consultations with the public and private sectors,&#13;
and NGOs on the policy and regulatory constraints at the provincial&#13;
level. The objectives of the workshops would be to obtain&#13;
feedback on the results of the above study, to agree a hierarchy of&#13;
problems, and to prioritize obstacles to be removed. The&#13;
workshops would be held in each affected region. Costs include a&#13;
facilitator and travel expenses;&#13;
(iii)   Drafting revised provincial legislation and regulations&#13;
(US$100,000). Drafting model legal documents and regulations in&#13;
close coordination with the provinces, and following the priorities&#13;
agreed in (a) (vi). This would be done in about 10 Provinces.&#13;
Costs include about 20 p/m of local lawyers;&#13;
(iv)   Domestic travel and subsistence (US$100,000). Domestic travel&#13;
and subsistence outside Buenos Aires for internationally recruited&#13;
consultants, and outside place of residence for locally recruited&#13;
consultants, calculated at the rate of about US$1,000 per p/m of&#13;
consultants;&#13;
(v)   Training tours to the USA, Brazil and Bolivia (US$100,000).&#13;
Training tour 1 would be to the USA for forest taxation, public&#13;
lands management, and private forest land policies; and training&#13;
tour 2, to Bolivia and Brazil on Chaco Region-related problems,&#13;
including charcoal manufacturing. In addition to carefully selected&#13;
staff from DRFN, a maximum of 8 representatives of provincial&#13;
governments and legislatures directly involved with native forest&#13;
and protected areas would be included in each tour. Priority would&#13;
be given to those provinces most advanced in putting in place&#13;
adequate legislation;&#13;

National Inventory of Native Forests and Protected Areas&#13;
(Baseline Costs US$6.1 million)&#13;
2.    The inventory would be carried out in two phases. Phase 1 would involve: (a) the&#13;
purchase of two sets of computer-compatible tapes of satellite imagery for the entire area&#13;
of Argentina, one at the beginning of the project, and the second toward the end; (b) the&#13;
preparation from an analysis of the first set of these tapes of a basic ecosystem map for the&#13;
entire country, which would be used, inter alia, to provide information on land use,&#13;
protected areas and the broad distribution and extent of the principal ecosystems in the&#13;
country, including, in particular, native forests; and (c) the preparation from an analysis of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -                            Annex B&#13;
the second set of these tapes of a basic ecosystem map for the entire country with&#13;
emphasis on native forests and protected areas, which would form the foundation for&#13;
monitoring changes in ecosystems, native forests, and protected areas.&#13;
3.    Phase 2 of the inventory of native forests and protected areas would first require&#13;
that the approach and methodology for completing the inventory be agreed between the&#13;
SNRyAH and other interested parties so that a standardized and technically sound&#13;
approach is adopted from the outset, one that would enable all data generated to be&#13;
efficiently incorporated and processed in the database. Internationally recruited&#13;
consultants (the lead consultant firm) would play a central role in this undertaking, as&#13;
would a workshop to foster consensus before the field work is begun. Once the approach&#13;
and methodology is agreed under Phase 2, and because Phase I would be proceeding in&#13;
parallel, field work could begin once sufficient progress has been made under Phase 1.&#13;
4.    Phase 2 would involve systematic field sampling, or ground truthing, to verify&#13;
spectral signatures of different tree species on satellite images, to obtain more detailed&#13;
information on soils, slope, ownership, recent land use history, and habitat disturbance.&#13;
Biodiversity inventories would be carried out in priority areas within the five principal&#13;
forest formations, namely, the Yungas, the Paranaense, the Chaco, the Espinal and Sub-&#13;
Antarctic Forests. These would be used to determine biodiversity indices in these&#13;
formations, assess species endemism, refine ecotype boundaries, measure species&#13;
dominance, define species hierarchies, describe habitat structures, assess the degree of&#13;
threat, identify areas in need of protection, and monitor the dynamics of change over time.&#13;
5.    Cost Estimates and ImDlementation of Phase 1. Phase 1 would have a baseline&#13;
cost of US$1.9 million. Baseline costs include: (a) the purchase of two sets of computer&#13;
compatible tapes of satellite imagery for the entire area of Argentina, one at the beginning&#13;
of the project, and the second toward the end; (b) internationally recruited lead consultant&#13;
firm, including 76 person-months of internationally recruited consultants for image&#13;
analysis and map production; and (c) 3 5 person-months of locally recruited consultants to&#13;
work with the lead consultant firm. A breakdown of costs is given in Table B.2.&#13;

6.    Cost Estimates and Implementation of Phase 2. Phase 2 would have a baseline&#13;
cost of US$4.2 million. This would include:&#13;
(a)    60 p/m of internationally recruited consultants (the lead consultant firm) for&#13;
designing and obtaining agreement to the approach and methodology for&#13;
Phase 2 of the inventory, finalizing TORs, preparing inventory manual,&#13;
managing the carrying out of the inventory, and exercising quality control;&#13;
(b)   workshop to obtain consensus on methodology and approach to carrying&#13;
out an inventory of Biodiversity within selected native forests and&#13;
protected areas;&#13;
(c)    20 p/m of internationally recruited consultants for training participants in&#13;
the methodology for completing Phase 2; these would be supplied by the&#13;
lead consultant firm as part of its contract;&#13;
(d)    1,680 p/m of locally recruited consultants mostly for field sampling;&#13;
(e)    2 vehicles and equipment, including computer hardware and software.&#13;

8.    As already stated, the lead consultant firm would be responsible for designing and&#13;
obtaining agreement to the approach and methodology for completing Phase 2 of the&#13;
inventory, finalizing TOR, preparing inventory manual, managing the carrying out of the&#13;
inventory in the field, and exercising quality control. It is expected that the actual field&#13;
inventory work would be carried out under local consultant contracts. The country would&#13;
be divided along ecosystem lines, with the inventory work in each region completed under&#13;
different local consultant contracts.&#13;
Development and Management of a Related Database (Baseline Costs US$1.4 million)&#13;
9.    In addition to generating raw data by carrying out the national inventory of native&#13;
forests and protected areas, it is necessary that SRNyAH put in place a system for&#13;
processing this data and transforming it into information that can be readily accessed by&#13;
users. This requires the development of a database to handle this challenging task. To&#13;
some extent, at least, this database would have to be custom-designed to meet these&#13;
requirements of SRNyAH, and to help it fulfill its mandate as the lead federal agency&#13;
dealing with native forests and protected areas. The present small statistics unit (three&#13;
people) in DRFN would be transformed into a Database Management Unit (DBMU) with&#13;
responsibility for developing and managing this SRNyAH database. This would require a&#13;
major effort in institutional strengthening, including training, so that this new DBMU&#13;
would have the capacity to discharge its responsibilities. An internationally recruited&#13;
consultant firm (the lead firm) would put in place the system and manage it until the&#13;
DBMU is capable of taking over.&#13;
10.   Development and management of the database would have a baseline cost of&#13;
US$1.4 million and would include:&#13;
(a)    60 p/m of internationally recruited consultants (the lead consultant firm) for&#13;
selecting, adapting, and installing the software for the database, and&#13;
training and managing the DBMU staff until they are capable of taking&#13;
responsibility for the management of the database;&#13;
&#13;

C. Sub-Component: Applied Research and Studies to Facilitate the Improved&#13;
Management and Conservation of Native Forests (Baseline Costs US$5.0 million).&#13;
13.   Applied Research and Studies in the Chaco Region - Rationale and Objectives. The&#13;
Chaco region has the second largest vegetation type (after the Amazon) found in Latin&#13;
America, and occupies over one million km2 in four countries (Argentina has 46 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-                             Annex B&#13;
of the total area, Paraguay 32 percent, Bolivia 15 percent, and Brazil 7 percent). The&#13;
Chaco vegetation type is by far the largest forest/vegetation type in Argentina, where it&#13;
covers some 500,000 km2 of the total surface area of the country. Although the Chaco&#13;
region appears flat and uniform, it contains marshlands, palm savanna, several varieties of&#13;
grasslands, brushlands and thorn forests at higher elevations. The main forest type of the&#13;
Chaco region is the Parque Chaqueno, which is part of the Gran Chaco that extends from&#13;
Argentina to Bolivia and is characterized by low rainfall (600-1,000 mm per year) and low&#13;
deciduous forests, consisting mainly of the species Quebracho colorado, Quebracho&#13;
blanco, and Lapacho negro. Stocking and annual increment are both low in the Chaco&#13;
region, averaging about 100 m3 per ha and 1 m3 per ha per year, respectively. At lower&#13;
elevations, the soils are silty mud with a clay hardpan that inhibits percolation. These soils&#13;
are rich in minerals, calcium, phosphorous and potassium, but low in organic matter.&#13;
14.   The Chaco region's vegetation has been severely degraded over years of&#13;
mismanagement, especially overgrazing and unplanned tree harvesting. This has led to&#13;
desertification, soil erosion, and decreased infiltration, leading to increasing risks of&#13;
flooding, loss of wildlife habitat, and modifications in vegetation composition to the extent&#13;
that the existence of some tree species (e.g., Schinopsis spp.) are endangered. While these&#13;
problems are apparent to the trained observer and are being felt by the local people who&#13;
suffer economically from their effects, there is surprisingly little solid information on the&#13;
magnitude of the physical and socio-economic impacts.&#13;
15.   Some observers (e.g., Redford et al, 1990) maintain that the arid environments of&#13;
the tropics and semi-tropics, such as that found in the Chaco region, have the vegetation&#13;
types most susceptible to alternation by man and the least understood. This is partially&#13;
because the concentration of attention on the tropical rainforests has deflected attention&#13;
from the more open vegetation formations of the semi-arid regions of South America. In&#13;
fact, studies (Redford et. al., 1990) show that the rainforests do not hold a monopoly in&#13;
terms of species richness. One study comparing the Chaco in Central Paraguay with the&#13;
Manu National Park in Peru (a rainforest area) has shown that there were 30 species of&#13;
large and medium size mammals in the Chaco region compared with 34 in the rainforest.&#13;
Another study comparing the Gran Chaco (including Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia)&#13;
with the Venezuela lowlands east of the Andes, showed that the Chaco region has 53&#13;
species of medium and large mammals compared with the same number for the rainforest&#13;
of Venezuela. The conclusion of these studies is that the Chaco region is as rich as&#13;
tropical rainforests in terms of numbers of large mammalian species. One member of this&#13;
study team was unable to find any area in the Argentina Chaco region that had not been&#13;
modified by recent human activity and believes that the "degradation of the dry Argentina&#13;
Chaco region is one of the greatest, yet least known, ecological catastrophes in South&#13;
America" (Redford et. al., 1990). That article goes on to emphasize that we "do not yet&#13;
know enough about the Chaco region to determine how or if sustainable development is&#13;
possible", but that work there could "serve as an invaluable model for developing an&#13;
understanding of ecological processes in arid regions."&#13;
16.   Unlike the Patagonia region--which has the Center for Forest Investigation and&#13;
Extension in Andean Patagonia (CIEFAP) and the National Commission for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -                            Annex B&#13;
Promotion and Development of Patagonia (CONADEPA)--there is no focal point for&#13;
systematic information gathering and well planned, long-term research and mitigation&#13;
efforts in the Chaco region. Some ad-hoc work has been done by the Universities of&#13;
Cordoba and Santiago del Estero, as well as by some NGOs, but little has been&#13;
documented in a systematic way, and there is no strategy which would lead to definitive&#13;
answers. Furthermore, Argentine institutions have limited capacity to promote, support,&#13;
and monitor conservation oriented technologies, and there is no experience with&#13;
mechanisms for paying private parties for the production of public goods and services on&#13;
their properties.&#13;
17.   Details on the approval process and selection criteria to be followed by SRNyAH&#13;
in awarding research and study contracts under this sub-component are given in the&#13;
Attachment to this Annex.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -                           Annex B&#13;
Attachment&#13;
Implementation of the Sub-Component: ADplied Research and Studies to Facilitate&#13;
Improved Mananement and Conservation of Native Forests&#13;
I.   Implementation of this sub-component would be planned, managed and supervised&#13;
by SRNyAH with the assistance of a PIU which would be staffed on a full-time basis&#13;
with, inter alia, a Coordinator, two Technical Managers, and an accountant. The process&#13;
which SRNyAH would follow in selecting, approving and financing research and study&#13;
proposals is outlined in this Attachment.&#13;
2.    SRNyAH would have the freedom to take the initiative and to suggest topics for&#13;
study that it regarded as high priority. More generally, however, SRNyAH would rely on&#13;
a competitive system for generating research and study topics and ideas in order to&#13;
provide it with the opportunity to tap into the latest thinking in Argentina and elsewhere&#13;
on how best to respond to the challenges inherent in its mandate of improving the&#13;
management and conservation of native forests. This competitive system would provide&#13;
all interested researchers and consultants with the opportunity to compete for funding,&#13;
while leaving with SRNyAH the responsibility to allocate the available scarce funds wisely.&#13;
3.    To obtain approval, a research or study proposal would have to pass four tests; (a)&#13;
a technical test to ensure its technical soundness and quality; (b) an economic/financial test&#13;
which, assuming the research or study outcome is as expected, would show a likely&#13;
favorable balance between expected benefits and costs (e.g., payments to farmers on&#13;
privately owned land in the Chaco region, including the transactions costs involved); (c) a&#13;
sustainability test which, assuming the research or study outcome is as expected, would&#13;
show a reasonable expectation of sustainability (e.g., in the Chaco region, based on a&#13;
declining gap between the with- and without-project net financial returns to the farmer);&#13;
and (d) an environmental test, which would exclude proposals that would be harmful to&#13;
the environment.&#13;
4.    Initially, the applied research and studies supported in the Chaco region under this&#13;
sub-component would provide for the investment and operating costs needed to close the&#13;
financial gap between the net returns a farmer would expect when testing environmentally&#13;
friendly management systems and the returns to the farmer without any change in&#13;
management. In order to enhance the probability of researching technical packages which&#13;
would prove to be sustainable, the evaluation and approval process for research and study&#13;
proposals would pay particular attention to ensuring that the required amount of payment&#13;
to individual owners of native forests would be on a declining scale.&#13;
5.    All of the research and study proposals approved by SRNyAH would have the&#13;
following characteristics: (a) if successfully completed, they would yield valuable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                             Annex B&#13;
information concerning a geographic area or topic about which decisions of importance to&#13;
environmental values are being, or shortly will be, considered; and (b) valuable results&#13;
could be produced within the life of the proposed project.&#13;
6.    The approval process for research and study proposals submitted by non-SRNyAH&#13;
staff for either the Chaco region or areas lying outside the Chaco region would follow the&#13;
following steps:&#13;
(a)   interested parties, including researcher(s), consultant(s), NGOs, farmer(s),&#13;
etc., would consult, when appropriate, with an SRNyAH research&#13;
committee, as per (c) below, for clarification of the rules, and to obtain a&#13;
positive or negative response to their preliminary research or study&#13;
proposals, following advertisements which SRNyAH would place in the&#13;
national and local press;&#13;
(b)    assuming a positive response to the preliminary research or study proposal,&#13;
a detailed research or study proposal would then be submitted to SRNyAH&#13;
for its consideration, including, inter alia, the research or study objectives,&#13;
description of task, research or study methodology, a plan for completing&#13;
the research or study, a chronogram of implementation, names of&#13;
researchers, including their qualification and experience, level of payments&#13;
requested, and proof of land ownership in all cases where farmer&#13;
participation is involved;&#13;
(c)    a Research Committee--consisting of the Director of DRFN (or his&#13;
designee), the Technical Manager of the PIU, a Statistician and an&#13;
Economist--would complete an evaluation of each research or study&#13;
proposal, paying particular attention to, inter alia, its priority within the&#13;
overall research and study program established by SRNyAH for either the&#13;
Chaco region or areas lying outside the Chaco region, expected outputs,&#13;
technical feasibility, soundness of the research or study design, expected&#13;
benefits relative to costs should research or study results be as expected,&#13;
likelihood of sustainability should research or study results be as expected,&#13;
proposal for quantification of results, payment schedule, and qualification,&#13;
motivation and experience of researchers and sponsoring party. On the&#13;
basis of the evaluation, the committee would accept or reject the proposal;&#13;
(d)   if the proposal is approved in step (c), which would require the written&#13;
agreement of the Technical Manager, the Statistician, and the Economist,&#13;
then a contract would be written and signed between the SRNyAH and the&#13;
parties involved, with the research or study proposal included as part of the&#13;
contract. The contract would include, inter alia, the research or study&#13;
objectives, expected outputs, description of task, research or study&#13;
methodology, names of researchers and consultants, chronogram of&#13;
implementation, and schedule of payments by all parties, including&#13;
SRNyAH,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -                           Annex B&#13;
(e)   SRNyAH would monitor carefully the progress under each research and&#13;
study contract and make periodic payments as warranted;&#13;
(f)   researcher(s) and/or consultants would submit final written reports, listing&#13;
achievements and failures and any departures from the contract;&#13;
(g)   SRNyAH would recruit independent financial and technical auditors to&#13;
audit compliance and evaluate results under each contract in order to&#13;
ensure the integrity of the process;&#13;
(h)   SRNyAH would make final payment under the contract, or take other&#13;
appropriate action, depending on the outcome of the financial and technical&#13;
audit and evaluation of the research or study results.&#13;
7.    The approval process for research and study proposals submitted by SNyAH staff&#13;
for either the Chaco region or areas lying outside the Chaco region, which would not&#13;
exceed about 30 percent of the total research and studies funding, would follow the&#13;
following steps:&#13;
(a)   staff, where appropriate, would consult with the Research Committee for&#13;
clarification of the rules, and to obtain a positive or negative response to&#13;
their preliminary research or study proposals;&#13;
(b)   assuming a positive response to the preliminary research or study proposal,&#13;
SRNyAH would recruit individual consultants, following the procedures&#13;
agreed for this project, to prepare the detailed TORs, which would then be&#13;
submitted to SRNyAH for its consideration;&#13;
(c)   The Research Committee would complete an evaluation of the detailed&#13;
TORs along the lines outlined above in paragraph 6 (c), and if approved,&#13;
SRNyAH would recruit the necessary consulting services following the&#13;
procedures agreed for this project;&#13;
SRNyAH would follow the exact same steps outlined above in paragraph 6(e), 6(0, 6(g),&#13;
and 6(h).&#13;

ARGENTINA&#13;
NATIVE FORESTS AND PROTECTED AREAS PROJECT&#13;
Protected Areas Component&#13;
(Baseline Costs US$10.3 million)&#13;
A. Background&#13;
The National Park System&#13;
1.    Argentina was the first country in Latin America to create a national system of&#13;
parks. The system had its origin in 1903 with the private donation of some 7,500 ha to&#13;
the State for the purpose of "maintaining exceptionally beautiful places for the present and&#13;
future generations". That initial holding was enlarged to 43,000 ha in 1907, and then&#13;
again to 785,000 ha in 1922, before being designated the Nahuel Huapi National Park, the&#13;
nation's first national park which was created together with the National Parks&#13;
Commission in 1934. Other important milestones leading to the present national park&#13;
system include: the establishment of the country's other major southern parks--Lanin, Los&#13;
Alerces, Perito Moreno, and Los Glaciares--in 1937; the creation of the national school&#13;
for park rangers in 1967; and the development of a national protected areas system in&#13;
1986.&#13;
2.    The present national park and reserve system consists of 30 national protected&#13;
areas, which are estimated to cover about 2.8 million ha or about one percent of the total&#13;
national land area. The system has evolved over the last 60 years to include four classes&#13;
of protected areas: National Parks, National Reserves, Natural Monuments, and Natural&#13;
Strict Reserves. The National Parks and Natural Monuments are the protected categories&#13;
with the most restrictions on their use, allowing only for scientific, educational and&#13;
tourism activities. Sport hunting and fishing for exotic species, and commercial and&#13;
agricultural activities are allowed, through a permit system, only in the National Reserves.&#13;
3.    Park Administration. The lead agency responsible for managing the country's&#13;
national protected areas is the APN, which is a semi-autonomous agency within the&#13;
SRNyAH. The APN is headed by a Board of Directors composed of its president&#13;
(designated by the President of the nation), a vice president and four members&#13;
representing SRNyAH, the Secretariat of Tourism, the Ministry of Defense and the&#13;
Ministry of Interior. For overall planning and coordination, there are three national&#13;
directorates responsible for: conservation of protected areas; recreational and productive&#13;
resources; and administration, all located at the APN headquarters in Buenos Aires. The&#13;
National Directorate for Conservation of Protected Areas is responsible for: (a) defining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -                            Annex C&#13;
priorities and actions to ensure the preservation, conservation and management of natural&#13;
resources in national protected areas; (b) proposing mechanisms for monitoring and&#13;
controlling the impact of human activities in protected areas; (c) disseminating information&#13;
in national protected areas and organizing environmental education activities; and (d)&#13;
coordinating park protection activities and overseeing environmental impact evaluations.&#13;
The National Directorate for Recreational and Productive Resources is responsible for: (a)&#13;
evaluating and proposing to the Board of Directors the approval or denial of public and&#13;
private projects to exploit natural resources, build infrastructure or provide visitor&#13;
concessions, including recreational facilities, in national protected areas; (b) coordinating&#13;
the implementation of approved projects with the park superintendencies; and (c)&#13;
establishing conditions for rights, permits, concessions, fees and other actions associated&#13;
with the projects. The National Directorate for Administration is responsible for: (a)&#13;
preparing the annual budget and supervising and controlling its implementation; (b)&#13;
advising the Board of Directors on personnel administration; and (c) managing purchasing&#13;
and contracting of goods and services.&#13;
4.    At the field level, there are 13 superintendencies (i.e., headquarters) responsible for&#13;
the operational management of one or more of the national protected areas, including the&#13;
monitoring and control of approved concessions. Typically, the administrative structure&#13;
of a superintendency consists of three functional units responsible for administration,&#13;
works and infrastructure maintenance, and conservation management and control. Each&#13;
superintendency reports directly to the national directorate in Buenos Aires. For technical&#13;
support to the superintendencies, there are three Regional Technical Delegations (DTR),&#13;
which are located in Iguazu, Salta, and San Carlos de Bariloche.&#13;
5.    Personnel. Argentina's national public personnel system makes a distinction&#13;
between two types of permanent APN personnel: administrative (Sistema Nacional de la&#13;
Profesi6n Administrativa) and park guards (Cuerpo Nacional de Guardaparques). Park&#13;
guards, responsible for the day to day management of the parks, provide the full range of&#13;
management and protection functions such as nature interpretation, visitor safety, and&#13;
park security, including armed anti-poaching patrols. In addition, there are a number of&#13;
non-permanent categories of employees, namely: contractor, volunteers, and interns.&#13;
APN staff currently totals about 680, of which about 180 are park guards. Compensation&#13;
and career development opportunities are important issues for increasing the retention of&#13;
park guards and creating a more professional park management staff.&#13;
6.    Park Revenues. Table C. I shows APN's own-generated revenues and treasury&#13;
transfers over the last six years in 1995 dollars. APN's own-generated revenue has seen a&#13;
healthy growth (about 19 percent per year) over the past five years. However, since&#13;
there was a precipitous drop in such revenues in 1990, the 1995 estimate is only 10&#13;
percent higher than the 1989 revenue figure. In 1994, the most recent year for which&#13;
more detailed information is available, APN's own-generated revenue, excluding&#13;
exceptional one-time only sources of income such as sale of assets, was estimated to be&#13;
US$3.9 million. In that year, one park alone, Iguazu, accounted for approximately 45&#13;
percent of total income. The four Patagonian parks proposed for inclusion in this project&#13;
accounted for an additional 44 percent of the revenue generated in that year.&#13;
&#13;

1995     8,671,000      15,238,000         23,909,000&#13;
7.    Entrance fees, which are charged in only 11 national parks, make up about 42&#13;
percent of internally generated revenue. However, the level of these visitor fees, which&#13;
was increased from US$3 to US$5 per person in 1995, is not based on any study of&#13;
willingness to pay. Depending on the park, other important sources of park revenue&#13;
include: rental of park properties (9 percent); permits for fishing, hunting and boating (2&#13;
percent); pasture fees; royalties associated with forest exploitation in reserves; and&#13;
licensing of tourist guides and other concessionaires.&#13;
8.    Concession rates are based on limited bidding processes, or assigned arbitrarily,&#13;
and most of the existing concessionaires have contracts which have established a fixed-fee&#13;
structure over a 30-year period, with no contractual means to adjust for inflation or&#13;
variations in income. As a result, there are a number of cases in the park system where&#13;
park income has diminished to insignificant amounts despite the presence of very lucrative&#13;
concession operations. The APN has begun to address this issue through the replacement&#13;
of the traditional contract based on a fixed fee by one which establishes a percentage of&#13;
gross receipts (usually 3 percent). In general, opportunities to generate revenues have not&#13;
been well explored and, therefore, an important management issue is to ascertain to what&#13;
extent is it possible, or desirable, to increase revenue generation from protected areas,&#13;
without compromising the long-term benefits of protection.&#13;
9.    Operating Budget. APN's budget suffered cuts during the 1980s, followed by a&#13;
drastic cut in 1990, which limited its ability to maintain the equipment and infrastructure&#13;
needed to carry out its mandate to manage existing protected areas. The initial 1995&#13;
budget of US$27.8 million was a significant increase over the 1994 budget of US$22&#13;
million. Because of austerity measures, however, that 1995 budget was later cut to about&#13;
US$24 million. Of the total 1994 budget allocation, 56 percent covered salaries of&#13;
permanent staff, a relatively low proportion in comparison with other Latin America park&#13;
systems. APN's 1996 budget is US$24 million and has been allocated as shown in Table&#13;
C.2. It is noteworthy that the US$3.5 million allocated for land purchase is not fungible&#13;
because it comes from a special fund which is earmarked exclusively for this purpose and&#13;
funded by sales of assets.&#13;
&#13;

Total                           24,000,000&#13;
10.   Currently, it is estimated that about 60 percent of the budget is financed by the&#13;
national treasury and the remaining 40 percent comes from internally generated funds.&#13;
This compares with 86 percent financing from the treasury in 1989. Current policy is that&#13;
treasury funds are used exclusively to cover salaries and benefits of park staff, and that&#13;
own-generated revenues are used to cover everything else, including investments (and in&#13;
the case of a Bank loan, the counterpart funding). These park-generated revenues are&#13;
deposited in an APN account with the Banco de la Naci6n in Buenos Aires. Park&#13;
operating expenses are then managed through this account by a system of rotating funds&#13;
and petty cash.&#13;
11.   The treasury system, which is coordinated by the Tesoreria General de la Naci6n,&#13;
is moving towards the centralization of all public sector revenues and expenses into a&#13;
single account. This centralization will be completed by 1997, and is effectively&#13;
eliminating all individual accounts of the agencies that now have them, such as APN. This&#13;
will significantly reduce the level of autonomy of otherwise decentralized agencies like&#13;
APN, as they will no longer have the freedom to manage own-generated revenues.&#13;
12.   Budgeting and Accounting Systems. With the promulgation of the State Reform&#13;
(Reforma del Estado Nacional) Law No. 23,696 of 1989, and the Law of Ministries (Ley&#13;
Nacional de Ministerios) No. 24,190 of 1993, which moved APN from the Secretariat of&#13;
Agriculture to the Secretariat of Natural Resources (SRNyAH), APN has undergone, and&#13;
continues to undertake, major changes in its financial and administrative management&#13;
systems. As mandated by the Public Sector Financial Administration and Systems&#13;
Control Reform Law (Ley No. 24,156--Reforma de la Administraci6n Financiera y de los&#13;
Sistemas de Control del Sector Publico Nacional) in 1992, APN is responsible for&#13;
administering a financial system in compliance with national standards. Furthermore, the&#13;
Constitutional Reform Law of 1994, mandated that all national public sector institutions&#13;
adopt a double system of accounting, which is under the control of an Internal Auditing&#13;
Unit (UAI) in each agency, coordinated by the Sindicatura General de la Naci6n, which is&#13;
responsible to the President's Office.&#13;
13.   The current financial administration system of national public sector institutions,&#13;
which have now been adopted by APN (at least at the central administrative level), is&#13;
comprised of a standardized budgetary system, accounting system, auditing system,&#13;
public credit system, and treasury system. The Secretary of Finance of the Ministry of&#13;
Economy is responsible for the control of these systems and has prepared procedural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-                               Annex C&#13;
manuals and computer programs to standardize the operations across institutions. The&#13;
budgeting system that is being adopted is an improvement over the old system. The new&#13;
system, controlled by the National Budget Office (ONP) of the Secretariat of Finance, and&#13;
as detailed in a series of standardized operational manuals, now requires the preparation of&#13;
Annual Operation Plans (POAs), which draws on POAs from the field offices. While this&#13;
budgeting system is now in place in the central office of APN, the superintendencies are&#13;
still in the process of obtaining the software, manuals and training to conform to the&#13;
standard systems. In the interim, the current manual system is apparently working&#13;
satisfactorily.&#13;
14.   The standardized national double accounting system--Sistema Integrado de&#13;
Informaci6n Financiera (SIDIF)' --was issued by the Ministry of Economy in 1995 and is&#13;
being adopted by APN. While this standard system is now operational at the APN&#13;
headquarters, it still needs to be installed in the field offices, where the required&#13;
equipment, software, modems and operational manuals are yet to be acquired. As&#13;
required by law, in 1993 APN set up a UAI for internal auditing of all accounts as well as&#13;
for technical and legal operations. The UAI, which is composed of three lawyers, three&#13;
accountants and an engineer, operates on the basis of an Operational Manual, which was&#13;
issued by the Sindicatura General de la Naci6n, to which the UAI must send periodic&#13;
reports. The Constitutional Reform Law of 1994 also established an external auditing&#13;
authority under the Auditoria General de la Naci6n, which depends on the National&#13;
Congress.&#13;
15.   The UAI's 1995 audit has already pointed to the following problems that need to&#13;
be resolved: lack of an inventory of concession obligations, lack of information on the&#13;
payments and other obligations of concessionaires (and, hence, the failure to collect all&#13;
fees), lack of interaction across APN on methods of concession contracting, lack of clarity&#13;
regarding responsibility for concession and permit management, and a general lack of&#13;
planning.&#13;
16.   Priorities and Constraints. The APN budget documents have identified three&#13;
priority program areas, namely: (a) management of protected areas; (b) training and&#13;
institutional strengthening; and (c) strengthening the national system of protected areas.&#13;
Priorities under the protected areas management program are: (i) management of&#13;
protected areas through an increased allocation of resources required to maintain and&#13;
improve existing infrastructure, with particular emphasis given to park headquarters, park&#13;
guard entrance stations, and the maintenance and repair of utility vehicles; (ii) purchase of&#13;
equipment and in particular utility vehicles needed to support park control functions; (iii)&#13;
interpretation and environmental education activities, under which interpretation centers&#13;
and visual aid equipment were identified as priorities; and (iv) park boundary delimitation.&#13;
Under the training and institution strengthening program, the main priority identified was&#13;
the need to continue to develop and provide training courses and workshops for&#13;
professional and technical personnel and park guards. Under the third program area--&#13;
I This system was developed under the World Bank Loan (3362-AR)--Public Sector Reform TA Loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55 -                            Annex C&#13;
support for the national system of protected areas (NSPA)-- one of the more important&#13;
identified needs is to improve the management capability of participating institutions (i.e.,&#13;
provincial agencies, NGOs), which would help to facilitate coordination and cooperation&#13;
between the national and provincial governments and promote a more integrated approach&#13;
to the management of the park system.&#13;
17.   The main constraint identified in the budgetary policy document was a general&#13;
shortage of funding, which can be attributed to poor economic management in earlier&#13;
decades and recent efforts to address long-standing and deep fiscal problems at the&#13;
national level. Limited financial resources have generally resulted in under-investment in&#13;
park infrastructure and, because of inadequate maintenance, a significant loss of&#13;
equipment needed to adequately carry out APN's legal mandate. Investment in park&#13;
infrastructure has decreased to such an extent that much of the existing infrastructure is in&#13;
various states of decay and new facilities have not kept pace with the actual and potential&#13;
visitation levels. Visitation rates are believed to be stagnant or even in decline in some&#13;
parks, partially because of the perception that there are no new attractions to be seen and&#13;
the quality and safety (some roads and trails have become very unsafe to travel) of the&#13;
experience is reduced from times past. Critical equipment needs include utility vehicles,&#13;
radio telecommunications, fire fighting equipment and uniforms. Other major constraints&#13;
include: (i) the overly-centralized structure of APN, which constrains rapid and efficient&#13;
decision-making; (ii) the lack of planned-based annual operating budgets; (iii) the lack of&#13;
incentives to increase revenues at the park level due to the fact that park-generated&#13;
revenues are deposited in a general APN account with the Banco de la Naci6n in Buenos&#13;
Aires; and (iv) shortage of qualified personnel, particularly in the medium and higher&#13;
professional levels.&#13;
B. The Protected Areas Component&#13;
Objectives and Strategy&#13;
18.   The objectives of the Protected Areas Component are: (a) to begin the process of&#13;
modernizing APN and transforming it into a world-class parks administration; and (b) to&#13;
increase the capacity of four national parks in Patagonia to accommodate a greater&#13;
number of tourists without damaging their environment. The Protected Areas Component&#13;
would comprise two sub-components: (i) the development of a plan for the modernization&#13;
of APN; and (ii) specific infrastructure developments and management strengthening in&#13;
four selected parks in the Patagonian region: Lanin, Nahuel Huapi, Los Alerces, and Los&#13;
Glaciares.&#13;
Modernization of APN&#13;
19.   This component is described in some detail in the main text. The baseline costs&#13;
have been estimated at US$0.8 million; the overwhelming share of this cost would be for&#13;
consulting services. Costs have been estimated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56 -                            Annex C&#13;
(a)   Phase 1: agreeing on a vision of a reformed APN: the lead consultant firm&#13;
would supply about 19 p/m of internationally recruited consultants, and&#13;
about 4 p/m of Argentine consultants, to develop and reach consensus with&#13;
Argentine authorities on a vision for a reformed APN. This work would&#13;
include the preparation of an issues-oriented report on the design and&#13;
workings of the three best park systems in the world (to include probably&#13;
New Zealand, the United States and Australia), and the synthesis from this,&#13;
and discussions in Argentina, of a vision for a reformed APN. The cost of&#13;
this phase has been estimated at about US$300,000, including provisions&#13;
for workshops to assist in the process of reaching consensus between the&#13;
principal stakeholders involved;&#13;
(b)   Phase 2: developing a detailed blueprint to implement the agreed vision: the&#13;
lead consultant firm would supply about 30 p/m of internationally recruited&#13;
consultants, and 15 p/m of Argentine consultants, to design the core&#13;
systems for the reformed APN. These would include legal, managerial,&#13;
financial, personnel, contracting, including of concessions, and incentives.&#13;
The cost of this phase has been estimated at about US$400,000;&#13;
(c)   Phase 3: developing an implementation plan for the agreed blueprint: the&#13;
lead consultant firm would supply about 5 p/m of internationally recruited&#13;
consultants and about 9 p/m of Argentine consultants, to prepare an&#13;
implementation plan for the above agreed blueprint of the reformed APN.&#13;
The cost of this phase has been estimated at about US$100,000.&#13;
Infrastructure Development in the Four Project Parks&#13;
20.   Under this sub-component, infrastructure investments in selected parks would be&#13;
financed, including information and access-control offices that would result in increased&#13;
entrance fee capture, visitor centers, mountain refuges for trekkers and for use by park&#13;
guards while patrolling the parks, observation points and trails, park guard housing,&#13;
restoration of historical and cultural centers of attraction, and repair or building of roads.&#13;
In general, development sites within parks would increase tourism satisfaction and revenue&#13;
capture. The project would also support improved management in the selected parks&#13;
through the funding of: (a) equipment (mainly radio communications and computers) and&#13;
vehicles; and (b) training seminars and short courses, attendance at conferences and&#13;
technical meetings, and training materials. The selected parks, and the proposed&#13;
investment program in each, are briefly described below.&#13;
21.   Nahuel Huapi. Created in 1934 as one of the country's first two national parks,&#13;
Nahuel Huapi is today considered Argentina's "flagship" national park. The park and&#13;
reserve together are estimated to cover some 710,000 ha, of which about 470,000 ha is&#13;
zoned as national park. Characteristic environments are the high Andean forest, the steppe&#13;
and aquatic environments (lakes and rivers). Major tourism uses of the park include world&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57-                             Annex C&#13;
class fishing, trekking, white-water rafting, camping, skiing and sightseeing. High&#13;
visitation areas in the park include Isla Victoria, the black glacier at Cerro Tronador, the&#13;
Los Alerces waterfall, Peninsula Quetrihue, Lake Steffen, and Puerto Blest. Current&#13;
tourism is estimated at about 300,000 visitors (of which 236,000 paid entrance fees). In&#13;
1995, entry fees alone accounted for US$773,000 of park revenue, which represents about&#13;
73 percent of the total revenue collected in Nahuel Huapi that year. The park's 1995&#13;
budget was US$3.9 million.&#13;
22.   The costs of this sub-component in Nahuel Huapi have been estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)   construction of 3 new information and access control posts, 3 new visitor&#13;
centers and conversion of 2 existing structures to visitor centers, and 3 new&#13;
volunteer houses; and the improvement or repair of 5 mountain refuges&#13;
(1,000 m2), 5 observation stations/trails, and one historical structure; for&#13;
a total construction cost of about US$1,533,000;&#13;
(b)   road works, including the repair of 74 km and some 30 km of new roads,&#13;
costing about US$2,377,661;&#13;
(c)   vehicles (4) and boats (2), costing US$150,000;&#13;
(d)   equipment (field, computer, and communication), costing US$80,700.&#13;
23.   Lanin. The Lanin National Park was created in 1937 to protect a representative&#13;
portion of the Andean-Patagonian forests, which contains a number of endemic species.&#13;
The park and reserve cover about 379,000 ha, of which some 195,000 ha is classified as&#13;
national park. The park represents an impressive mixture of volcanoes, mountains,&#13;
thermal waters, and 24 lakes. Major tourism attractions include rafting, trout fishing,&#13;
horseback riding, beach activities, winter skiing, sailing and mountain climbing. One of&#13;
the biggest tourist attractions is the Lanin volcano (3,744 meters above sea level).&#13;
Tourism visits in 1995 were estimated at about 55,000, of which about 30,000 paid an&#13;
entrance fee. These fees totaled some US$84,400, which was 38 percent of total park&#13;
revenue collected in Lanin for that year. The park's 1995 budget was US$2.0 million.&#13;
Situated in the southeast portion of Neuquen Province, the park protects a series of&#13;
catchments including the Lacar and Huechulafquen watersheds. These are critical&#13;
headwaters to several major downstream hydroelectric projects, the more important of&#13;
which are El Choc6n, Piedra del Aguila, and Alicura.&#13;
24.   The costs of this sub-component in Lanin have been estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)   construction of 3 new information and access control offices, 3 visitor&#13;
centers, 3 new volunteer houses (total estimated area of 900 m2) and the&#13;
repair of one historical structure, for a total construction cost of&#13;
US$1,072,400;&#13;
(b)   road works including the repair of 12 km of the Quila Quina road, costing&#13;
US$174,756;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                            Annex C&#13;
(c)   vehicles (3), costing US$75,000,&#13;
(d)   equipment (field, computer, and communication), costing US$81,700.&#13;
25.   Los Glaciares. The Los Glaciares National Park was created in 1937 primarily for&#13;
preserving the area's ice fields and glaciers, which comprise the third largest ice mass in&#13;
the world. Situated in the southwest portion of Santa Cruz Province, the park and reserve&#13;
cover an estimated 600,000 ha, of which the glacial system covers 143,000 ha and an&#13;
additional 154,000 ha is classified as national reserve. The glacier field is located along a&#13;
350-km band of the Andean cordillera and is composed of some 47 major glaciers that&#13;
vary in length from 40 to 70 km. In 1981, the park was declared a UNESCO World&#13;
Heritage Site, mainly because of its glaciological and geomorphological importance, but&#13;
also because of the presence of sub-arctic forests and Patagonian steppe and the&#13;
associated fauna (including several rare and endangered species). In addition to ice fields&#13;
and glaciers, the protected area comprises the extreme western portions of the Viedma&#13;
and Argentino lakes, which are part of the headwaters of a series of rivers that drain the&#13;
Patagonian steppe. Located in one of the least populated provinces in the country, the&#13;
park is contiguous with two Chilean Patagonian national parks: Bernardo O'Higgins and&#13;
Torres del Paine. High tourist demand is concentrated in the Peninsula de Magallanes&#13;
area, mainly because of the Moreno Glacier, relict forests, and visitation infrastructure.&#13;
Other tourist attractions include petrified forests, hiking trips on the glaciers, prehistoric&#13;
caves, boating in fjords, mountain hiking and trekking. Over the last five years, tourism&#13;
has been increasing by about 10 percent a year. Paid tourist visits in 1995 numbered&#13;
72,000. About 50 percent of those tourists came from Europe, and another 30 percent&#13;
from North America. Total tourism revenue in Los Glacares was estimated at&#13;
US$355,000 in 1995, of which US$160,000 was from entrance fees. The park's 1995&#13;
budget was US$355,000.&#13;
26.   The costs of this sub-component in Los Glaciares have been estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)   construction of 2 new information and access control offices, 2 new visitor&#13;
centers, 2 new volunteer houses, 2 new park guard houses, and the&#13;
completion of one guard house, for a total of 790 m2 of construction,&#13;
costing about US$950,000;&#13;
(b)   road works, including the repair of the 33 km road leading to P. Moreno&#13;
Glacier, costing about US$435,000;&#13;
(c)   vehicles (2), costing US$50,000;&#13;
(d)   equipment (field, computer, and communication), costing US$46,000.&#13;
27.   Los Alerces. This park was created in 1937, primarily for the protection of the&#13;
alerce (Fitzroya cupressoides) forests. This forest represents the largest remaining stand&#13;
of these trees, many of which are over 3,000 years old. Situated in Chubut Province, the&#13;
park covers some 263,000 ha and is dominated by three mountain ranges and an inter-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59 -                            Annex C&#13;
connecting system of lakes. Other major ecotypes protected by the park include the&#13;
Patagonian Steppe and the Valdivian Rainforests. Tourism activities include hiking,&#13;
boating, and fishing. Total entry fee revenue in 1995 was estimated at US$52,000, or&#13;
approximately 34 percent of total park revenue. The total number of visitors in 1995 was&#13;
estimated at 70,000, of which only about 19,000 paid entrance fees due to a shortage of&#13;
control points. The park's 1995 budget was US$1.4 million and its own-generated&#13;
revenue in 1995 were estimated at US$205,000. The park plays an important role in&#13;
protecting the headwaters of the Futaleufui dam.&#13;
28.   The costs of this sub-component in Los Alerces have been estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)   construction of 2 new information and access control offices, I new visitor&#13;
center, I new volunteer house (total estimated area of 399 m2) and I&#13;
observation station/trail, for a total construction cost of about&#13;
US$457,000;&#13;
(b)   vehicles (2) and boat (1), costing US$75,000;&#13;
(c)   equipment (field, computer, and communication), costing US$61,600.&#13;
29.   Strengthening the Management of the DTRP and the Four Project Parks. In&#13;
addition to the infrastructure investments in the selected parks, this sub-component would&#13;
include funding for strengthening the DTRP, which serves Patagonia, and the management&#13;
of the four selected parks. Investments would include:&#13;
(a)   two vehicles for DTRP, costing US$50,000;&#13;
(b)   equipment for DTRP (computer and related technical equipment), costing&#13;
US$124,000;&#13;
(c)   2 training seminars, 2 short courses, attendance at conferences and&#13;
technical meetings, and miscellaneous training and promotional materials,&#13;
costing US$200,000;&#13;
(d)   internationally recruited consultants: 14 p/m contracted for technical&#13;
assistance and/or for conducting training programs, costing US$152,600;&#13;
and&#13;
(e)   locally contracted consultants: 507 p/m to support engineering studies,&#13;
management plan preparation, environmental assessment/analysis and other&#13;
activities associated with sub-component implementation, costing about&#13;
US$1.35 million.&#13;

Financial Analysis&#13;
31.   Tables C.4 - C. 7 show the financial analysis for the proposed investments in the&#13;
four parks. The results of this analysis demonstrates that the investments are financially&#13;
viable: the internal financial rates of returns (IRRs) were 13 percent, 16 percent, 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                            Annex C&#13;
percent and 36 percent respectively, for Nahuel Huapi, Lanin, Los Glacares and Los&#13;
Alerces.&#13;
32.   In calculating these financial rates of return, the following assumptions were used.&#13;
The investment costs were taken from the project cost tables. The training and TA costs&#13;
of the Delegation Technica (DTRP) were assigned in direct proportion to each park's&#13;
relative contribution to the component's total investment cost. For assigning the vehicle&#13;
and equipment costs of the DTRP, it was assumed that some 80 percent of these costs&#13;
would be attributed to the four project parks ( while the remaining 20 percent would be&#13;
used for the other four Patagonian parks). The 80 percent assigned to project parks was&#13;
then assigned between the four project parks according to each park's contribution to the&#13;
total investment costs. Incremental operating costs were provided by APN. It was also&#13;
assumed that vehicles would be replaced every five years, and that the major rehabilitation&#13;
of roads under the project would result in maintenance savings over the following four&#13;
years for those roads.&#13;
33.   The projected incremental revenues for each park, with- and without-project, were&#13;
derived from a study conducted by the University of Camague (Otero, 1996). The&#13;
revenue and incremental cost streams were run over a twenty-year period following the&#13;
completion of the investment phase. To estimate the revenue stream from year 2003&#13;
onward, the historic tourist visitation growth rate of 4.5 percent for Patagonian parks was&#13;
applied to both the with- and without-project scenarios for Lanin, Los Glacares, and Los&#13;
Alerces. Because Nahuel Huapi is centrally located, more easily accessible by air (of the&#13;
four parks it is the only one with a major airport) and road, and encloses the town of&#13;
Bariloche with its excellent hotels, and because of the type of investment being made in&#13;
this park, it is expected that, given appropriate advertisement, the with-project visitation&#13;
growth rate would exceed the historic growth rate by 1.5 percent (i.e., 6 percent versus&#13;
4.5 percent). It was also assumed that incremental revenues would be positive in the first&#13;
year of the park investment program because of an APN decision to focus initially on the&#13;
construction of control points, which would immediately start yielding revenues.&#13;

Environmental Reviews&#13;
34.   Under the mandate established in Law No 22.351 and resolution No. 16/94, APN&#13;
requires that an environmental assessment be carried out for every investment in protected&#13;
areas under its jurisdiction, including the construction and maintenance of public services&#13;
and tourist infrastructure. The requirements and administrative procedures are outlined in&#13;
APN's Reglamento para la Evaluacion Impacto Ambiental en Areas de la Administracion&#13;
de Parques Nacionales, a copy of which is available in the Project Files.&#13;
35.   Each investment is screened and a decision is made on whether it requires: (i) a full&#13;
Estudio de Impacto Ambiental (EIA), required for investments that are approximately&#13;
equivalent to what the Bank would classify as an "A" category investment; (ii) a less&#13;
detailed Informe de Impacto Ambiential (IIA), approximately equivalent to what the Bank&#13;
would classify as a "B" category project with relatively significant impacts; and (iii) an&#13;
Informe Medioambiental (IMA) for all investments with very minor environmental&#13;
impacts. The Reglamento outlines the required content for each of these reports; that&#13;
content is consistent with World Bank requirements as outlined in the Operational&#13;
Directive 4.01 on Environmental Assessment.&#13;
36.   Under the project, most of the investments in National Parks are small and would&#13;
require an IIA or an IMA, the only investments that would require an EIA are the two&#13;
new roads proposed for Nahuel Huapi National Park. Under current administrative&#13;
arrangements, the EIA, IIA or IMA will be prepared by APN staff or by consultants. The&#13;
cost for the analyses will be borne by APN and is included in the total project costs.&#13;
37.   The products of each of the analyses are submitted to the APN central directorate&#13;
prior to investments being made. In the case of an EIA, the Directorate appoints an&#13;
evaluation commission composed of recognized experts to assist with the review.&#13;
Following this external review, public consultation is solicited through notices in national&#13;
and local newspapers prior to final authorization.&#13;
Consultative Process&#13;
38.   Although less formally structured than the Environmental Assessment process,&#13;
APN also requires stakeholder consultation on the design of park management plans and&#13;
proposed interventions prior to approval. This is generally done through a series of local&#13;
workshops to which provincial authorities, local people, concessionaires, recreational user&#13;
groups, tourism organizations and NGOs are invited. As part of its commitments under&#13;
the project, the APN would build on existing institutional mechanisms, which can be&#13;
divided into a three phased approach. The first phase would consist of the re-&#13;
establishment of Consultative Commissions for each of the component parks. These&#13;
Consultative Commissions would serve as a link to communities associated and affected&#13;
by park activities and facilitate consultation and participation in decisions regarding the&#13;
protection and management of the respective parks. These Commissions would be&#13;
structured to provide the flexibility to recruit additional representatives, depending on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                           Annex C&#13;
issue to be discussed. In the case of Nahuel Huapi, a tentative list of institutions has&#13;
already been compiled for appointment to the Commission.&#13;
39.   The second phase would consist of public consultation to discuss major works&#13;
under the project (e.g., new roads). Provision would be made for local consultation&#13;
through a priori notification of the proposed activities, and solicitation of comments and&#13;
suggestions supported through a public awareness campaign. A summary of comments&#13;
and suggestions would be compiled by the APN and submitted to the Consultative&#13;
Commission for evaluation. Where local circumstances warrant, a public workshop would&#13;
be supported for further discussions and to reach consensus. When public consensus is&#13;
reached on the proposed activities, the APN's existing environmental regulations require&#13;
public consultation for all activities that require an Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
prior to and following the completion of the Assessment. Only after the final approval of&#13;
the Environment Impact Assessment can the proposed work be approved and funded and&#13;
the construction begin.&#13;

ARGENTINA&#13;
NATIVE FORESTS AND PROTECTED AREAS PROJECT&#13;
Proiect Implementation Comoonent&#13;
(Baseline Costs US$2.2 million)&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    Argentina has started to define the role of the State in the forest sector in&#13;
comprehensive legislation embodied in Law 13273 of 1948. Under this law, the National&#13;
Forestry Administration of SAGyA, later to become the Argentine National Forestry&#13;
Institute (IFONA --Law 20531 of 1973), was created. Law 13273 of 1948, encompassed&#13;
only areas under Federal responsibility ("Territorios Nacionales"). At that time, the&#13;
government adopted forestry management methods commonly used in European&#13;
countries. It was in fact an Italian firm, later to become Argentinean, that started a pulp&#13;
industry in the 1 920s. Europe further developed its influence in this sector after World&#13;
War II, when refugees from many European countries, but most particularly foresters&#13;
from Croatia, helped Argentine policy makers and its private sector to become aware of&#13;
the sector's potential and the need for improving production and processing technologies.&#13;
This coincided with the government's decision to expand its agriculture frontier and&#13;
become increasingly self sufficient. A Forestry Directorate ("Direcci6n de Bosques") was&#13;
created in most provinces by provincial governments. Under the influence of European&#13;
immigrants, the forestry sector started to develop the necessary technology and to boost&#13;
logging as well as commercial activities.&#13;
2.    Despite such a promising start, the Provincial Forestry Directorates never had the&#13;
human resources or the institutional capacity to really enforce Law 13273 of 1948.&#13;
Provinces did not have skilled professionals to enforce federal or provincial legislation,&#13;
even when it was effectively created. Instead, private entrepreneurs were left to continue&#13;
their increasingly predatory use of the forests, and the prudence spelled out in the law was&#13;
largely ignored. In other words, the provincial capacity to manage the forest sector was&#13;
limited by their weak administrative ability to enforce existing laws, to formulate policies,&#13;
or follow a structured course of action. These constraints contributed to the limited&#13;
economic development of the forest sector over the years. This was further aggravated by&#13;
the intense competition from crops and livestock, which have always enjoyed greater&#13;
support in Argentina.&#13;
3.    The creation of IFONA in 1973 reflected a renewed government interest in the&#13;
forest sector for both natural resource protection and commercial development. However,&#13;
as the above-listed constraints were largely ignored, or not addressed effectively, forest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                              Annex D&#13;
resources continued to be depleted. The increasing awareness of this situation over the&#13;
years explains why the current government wants to reconsider its sectoral policy and give&#13;
this sector a higher priority. Based on the Government's forest sector development policy&#13;
and, more specifically, on the proposed project objectives, component by component, an&#13;
institutional capacity analysis (ICA) was carried out during project preparation, and&#13;
capacity gaps identified systematically. They are described below. Finally, the project-&#13;
supported institutional strengthening component (ISC) that follows, includes inputs aimed&#13;
at addressing all such identified capacity gaps, helping to strengthen the Government's&#13;
institutional strengthening plan and ability to implement its strategy for this sector.&#13;
B. The Role of the State and Development Policy&#13;
4.    Both because of growing awareness of environmental threats and of business&#13;
opportunities, the Government has recently moved from a de facto to a more conscious&#13;
national forest policy. Important decisions made over the last several years illustrate the&#13;
perceived need for change in the sector. However, the measures taken in this direction&#13;
need to be considerably strengthened to yield the expected results in policy reform.&#13;
Measures already taken include especially: (a) the creation (in 1992) of SRNyAH, directly&#13;
reporting to the President of the Republic, and (b) the decision to create within SRNyAH&#13;
the DRFN with responsibility for all aspects of native forests; and (c) the decision to&#13;
create the Directorate for Forestry Production (DPF) within SAPyA, itself belonging to&#13;
the Ministry of Economy. For native forests, DRFN has assumed the functions of the now&#13;
extinct IFONA, an autonomous entity that had been accused of inefficiency since its&#13;
creation in 1973.&#13;
5.    The emerging policy points towards a role for the private sector that would focus&#13;
on production and marketing, and a stronger, but still lean, role for the State limited&#13;
virtually to: (a) norm-making and enforcement, especially to protect natural resources; (b)&#13;
managing directly a protected areas system; and (c) stimulating expansion and productivity&#13;
growth in the private sector. Private sector stimulation would aim at increasing the area&#13;
under plantations and enhancing considerably the level of technology and productivity in&#13;
forest production.&#13;
6.    Derived from the above, the implicit role of the State in the forestry sector would&#13;
include: (a) adapting existing legislation and regulations to new requirements, (b) getting&#13;
organized to ensure harmony and an adequate network of institutional relationships, both&#13;
at the national and provincial levels; (c) disseminating relevant information and data; (d)&#13;
generating relevant technology and making it available to the private sector directly or&#13;
through extension activities; (e) directly intervening in areas in which there is insufficient&#13;
interest or capacity in the private sector, but which generate substantial positive&#13;
externalities; (f) managing directly national parks; and (g) promoting forestry-related&#13;
training at all levels, including universities.&#13;
&#13;

C. Sectoral Institutions&#13;
7.    Institutional Network Mapping. To achieve such objectives and to support the&#13;
above-defined role of the State, substantially enhanced institutional capacity is required.&#13;
Prior to addressing specific institutional capacity gaps (ICGs), a review of the sectoral&#13;
institutional universe is given below as well as a description of the identified ICGs that&#13;
became the basis for the design of the institutional development strategy and action plan&#13;
included in the proposed project. The forest sector's institutional network is complex and&#13;
unstable. This network is described below in some detail.&#13;
8.    Federal Institutions. Six ministries are involved in the forestry sector in Argentina.&#13;
After the dismantling of IFONA in 1991, its functions were redeployed and assigned to&#13;
SAPyA for plantations and related commercial and processing activities, and the rest to a&#13;
newly created SRNyAH within the Presidency of the Republic. DRFN within SRNyAH&#13;
has responsibility for managing all aspects of native forests, while the National Parks&#13;
Administration (APN), a semi-autonomous entity within SRNyAH, has the responsibility&#13;
for the administration of national parks. SAPyA is also responsible for INTA, a semi-&#13;
autonomous research and extension entity that includes a forestry research unit.&#13;
9.    Other Ministries have minor but significant roles. The Ministry of Education and&#13;
Culture is responsible for universities which have forestry training at the undergraduate&#13;
and graduate levels. The Secretariat of Science and Technology, among others, has some&#13;
responsibility for forestry research. Finally, the Secretariat of Industry and Commerce&#13;
includes: (a) a National Directorate of Industries which has jurisdiction over forestry&#13;
processing industries; and (b) a National Industrial Technology Institute, offering&#13;
extension services to timber industries.&#13;
10.   Other Forestry Entities at the National Level. In addition to the universities that&#13;
carry forestry programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels, quite a few other&#13;
entities have been created at the national level to address specific needs. Still others may&#13;
have a substantial influence on decisions taken at the regional level, although they do not&#13;
necessarily have an identity strictly related to the forestry sector. In addition to INTA's&#13;
involvement with research and technology dissemination, there is: (a) INTI, which is&#13;
involved in the modernization of industrial processes and reports to the Ministry of&#13;
Economy; (b) CITEMA, a technical arm of INTI, which has responsibility for testing&#13;
industrial processes and supporting private industry; (C) CICELPA, also a technical arm&#13;
of INTI, which does work similar to CITEMA but only for the pulp industry; (d)&#13;
CONICET, which reports to the Ministry of Education and Culture, and which is in&#13;
charge of coordinating all research activities and financing those which are important for&#13;
development in Argentina; (e) CONAQUE, which has responsibility for fostering the&#13;
development and protection of the Quebracho tree; and (f) CNA, which has the same&#13;
functions for the poplar tree. Institutions dealing with overall or regional coordination&#13;
are: (a) CONADEPA, which reports to the President of the Republic on coordination of&#13;
activities in the Patagonia region, where forestry resources are an important asset; and (b)&#13;
Federal Investment Council (CFI), which coordinates actions of the provincial ministers of&#13;
finance, including the municipal authorities of Buenos Aires, to ensure harmony and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -                              Annex D&#13;
coherence in development decisions affecting one or more provinces. In addition, the&#13;
legislative effort dealing with forestry is coordinated by two ad hoc Forestry Commissions&#13;
in the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively.&#13;
11.   Provincial Institutions. The 23 Argentinean provinces have different&#13;
organizational arrangements for provincial government and administration. In the forestry&#13;
sector, however, while the name of the administrative unit may change, the general&#13;
institutional design is relatively simple. This reflects the organizational setting in all&#13;
provinces. The focal point is a provincial Forestry Directorate, which is generally located&#13;
at the third management layer of government, with responsibility for both native and&#13;
planted forests. Each provincial Forestry Directorate is responsible for coordinating&#13;
forestry-related activities of all other entities, including national, within its province.&#13;
12.   The Private Sector. Since an Italian company began the pulp industry in Argentina&#13;
in the 1 920s, the private sector has organized itself into powerful associations and guilds&#13;
of all sorts. While the private sector has undoubtedly contributed to the development of&#13;
the forestry sector, it has also been a major obstacle to the full implementation of Law&#13;
13273, because of its perception that this law was an impediment to quick and substantial&#13;
profits. The most important private sector entities are: (a) AFOA, a grouping of all&#13;
forestry producers; (b) AFCP, which includes the most powerful and wealthy part of the&#13;
forestry-related private sector; (c) FAIMA, which includes about 2,000 timber companies;&#13;
and (d) CIEF, a private research entity which conducts research on behalf of its associated&#13;
members that supplements that carried out by the public sector. Finally, there are many&#13;
NGOs dealing directly or indirectly with the forest sector and dedicated mostly to raising&#13;
awareness about the need for protecting natural resources.&#13;
13.   Overall Sectoral Coordination. To ensure a minimum of harmony and coherence&#13;
in the forestry-related decision-making process at the national level, a National Forestry&#13;
Commission (CNB) was created with representatives from the national and provincial&#13;
governments, and from the private sector institutions listed above. The main role of CNB&#13;
is to advise the authorities on policy and/or investment decisions, while at the same time&#13;
ensuring that the private sector receives clear signals.&#13;
D. Institutional Capacity Analysis (ICA)&#13;
14.   To ensure the design of an institutional development strategy and action plan that&#13;
would address most pressing priorities, an ICA was carried out at the national and&#13;
provincial levels, and specific ICGs were identified from the five viewpoints reviewed,&#13;
namely, rules of the game; interinstitutional relationships; internal organization and&#13;
management at the entity level; personnel policies and reward systems; and skills of&#13;
individuals in both the public and private sectors. The analysis has been carried out in an&#13;
attempt to analyze to what extent the forest sector in Argentina will be able to efficiently&#13;
achieve the proposed project objectives. A description of the identified ICGs follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-                              Annex D&#13;
Rules of the Game&#13;
15.   Within this broad category of institutional capacity, four elements have been&#13;
identified as limiting the sector's ability to develop, namely, governance, legislation,&#13;
regulations, and culture. They are analyzed below.&#13;
16.   Governance. The first element of governance is a clearly articulated and&#13;
recognizable sectoral role of the State. Unfortunately, no such role is written anywhere,&#13;
and can only be deduced from Government's decisions and/or informal declarations.&#13;
Another important element of governance is the transparency and amount of participation&#13;
allowed in the decision-making process; there is much room for improvement.&#13;
17.   Poor policies have been the main constraint to the efficient growth of the forest&#13;
sector in Argentina and to the protection of "green" environmental values. Most of the&#13;
constraints stemmed from the lack of a clear policy environment outside the sector,&#13;
including macroeconomic, financial, trade, transportation and labor policies. In recent&#13;
years, as part of the macroeconomic liberalization and privatization programs of the&#13;
Government, much has been achieved in eliminating policy distortions affecting the&#13;
forestry sector. These measures will go a long way toward fostering efficient and&#13;
sustainable growth in the sector and in removing incentives for depleting the "green"&#13;
environment.&#13;
18.   When private sector representatives are interviewed about changes they would like&#13;
to see in the role of the State, they generally have precise ideas: (a) increased awareness&#13;
on the pait of the Government of the sector's potential; (b) more public sector stimuli&#13;
(direct promotion and fiscal incentives) to expand production; (c) more openness to the&#13;
private sector to ensure its participation in the decision-making process, in particular on&#13;
matters relating to international markets; and (d) research and extension programs more in&#13;
line with private sector priorities and dictated by market conditions.&#13;
19.   Legislation. Policy constraints to forestry growth and environmental protection&#13;
still exist, however, mainly contained in sector-specific legislation. National forest policy&#13;
in Argentina, as stated in Law 13273 of 1948, was very advanced for its time in that it&#13;
struck a balance between conservation and commercial objectives. The law was less&#13;
successful in its choice of policy instruments, because it favored "command and control"&#13;
mechanisms rather than market-based mechanisms, which would have been more&#13;
appropriate given the dominance of private forests in most of Argentina. Important policy&#13;
constraints to forest development and environmental protection also remain at the&#13;
provincial level. Provinces play a critical role in forest policy, but in most cases they have&#13;
failed to implement the farsighted approach contained in law 13273 of 1948.&#13;
Furthermore, provincial legislation tends to exacerbate the weaknesses of law 13273 by&#13;
relying too much on "command and control" mechanisms that, for the most part, are&#13;
misdirected and fail to achieve the underlying objectives. For example, some of these&#13;
measures attenuate property rights by reducing private option values. This creates&#13;
incentives against forests and in favor of competing uses, and introduces disincentives for&#13;
conservation and forest development. Also, because provincial sectoral legislation varies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -                             Annex D&#13;
widely between regions, it creates inefficiencies in the location of the industry and fosters a&#13;
provincial bureaucracy that, in many cases, does little more than collect special taxes to&#13;
finance itself&#13;
20.   Non-forest provincial policies also play an important role in distorting sector&#13;
activities. Some provinces adopted special taxation schemes to promote value-added&#13;
processing within provincial borders. Other provinces impose a tax on shipments of&#13;
timber raw materials to outside the province, a practice that may even be unconstitutional.&#13;
Transportation is still highly regulated at the provincial level, leading to the appearance of&#13;
trucking associations that behave like oligopolies and increase the transportation costs of&#13;
timber products. Finally, provincial legislation is particularly poor in the area of "green"&#13;
environmental protection. Although most environmental values are national or global in&#13;
scope, and it would not make sense for a province to take most initiatives in the absence&#13;
of transfer payments from the federal government or the global community, there are still&#13;
important local values, particularly for quality water supply and soil conservation, that are&#13;
poorly protected.&#13;
21.   Regulations. Furthermore, the related regulations are inadequate. For instance, in&#13;
case of fire, there is no special mechanism to mobilize the population as provided for in the&#13;
law. Also, there are no professionals to fight forest fires. This may result in the situation&#13;
being worsened when only volunteer fire fighters, without training or guidance, are&#13;
available. Regulations are also missing to help minimize risks. The existing fine system is&#13;
obsolete and does not stimulate prudence. In the field of regulations related to commerce&#13;
and industry, there is also a need for updating or creating new rules of the game, in&#13;
particular to foster productivity increases and exports. Finally, the regulations related to&#13;
watershed management are particularly weak.&#13;
22.   Culture. Finally, it is readily acknowledged in Argentina that there is little or no&#13;
"forestry culture" as compared with neighboring countries such as Chile. Awareness of&#13;
both the sectoral development potential and the possibility of expanding the forestry&#13;
capital stock, instead of just destroying it, is far from being sufficient. The development of&#13;
such an awareness is seen by the private sector as an important role of the public sector.&#13;
Another example of weak institutional capacity because of prevailing cultural patterns is&#13;
given by native populations (Mapuches in particular) who used to invade forests of&#13;
araucaria and araucana to eat their nutritious fruits, thus depleting wide areas of valuable&#13;
trees.&#13;
Interinstitutional Relationships&#13;
23.   The network of interinstitutional relationships within the forestry sector is complex&#13;
and unstable. In addition, most of the relationships are de facto or informal rather than&#13;
thought through on the basis of the need for many entities to cooperate and interrelate to&#13;
efficiently implement their work programs. Even when specific mechanisms exist such as&#13;
the National Forestry Commission (CNB), it has no power whatsoever except to give&#13;
advice. Experience has shown that this advice is rarely taken. At least this is the&#13;
sentiment in the private sector when CNB is mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                              Annex D&#13;
Internal Organization and Management at the Entity Level&#13;
24.   Organization at the entity level within the forestry sector is at least as weak as it is&#13;
at the interinstitutional level. In SRNyAH, weaknesses derive from its recent creation and&#13;
the lack of overall experience as to how to get organized to respond to the specific needs&#13;
of the country in protecting the environment and preserving natural resources. In the case&#13;
of SRNyAH's DRFN, it is evidently located at too low a level hierarchically to have much&#13;
influence or prestige.&#13;
25.   This picture is further aggravated by gaps related to other elements of capacity&#13;
also included in the broad category of "organization." These gaps are less specific to the&#13;
forestry sector and more common to many public entities in Argentina. Management&#13;
procedures and styles often seem antiquated. They do not include participatory&#13;
mechanisms, except on very rare occasions. The entity-level interpretation of prevailing&#13;
civil service rules is narrow and many entities' staff "work to rule", slowing down all&#13;
processes and certainly activating only part of their skills. Only rarely are there adequate&#13;
and updated manuals at the administrative and technical levels. Finally, as in many other&#13;
sectors, entities are given responsibilities and work programs without the corresponding&#13;
physical and financial resources (operating budgets) commensurate with the scope of their&#13;
work. Facilities are not well maintained and run. Office equipment and technology&#13;
generally do not cover the needs and tend to be obsolete as well. This situation has often&#13;
been denounced by the private sector when explaining the low credibility level of the&#13;
public sector. As a result, this element of capacity is far from adequate. On the contrary,&#13;
any sector modernization effort aimed at achieving higher levels of performance and&#13;
competitiveness in international markets, while simultaneously renewing the forestry&#13;
sector's capital stock, both quantitatively and qualitatively, is going to be severely&#13;
hampered by the above-described situation.&#13;
Personnel Policies and Reward Systems&#13;
26.   On this subject there is not much to say that would be specific to the forestry&#13;
sector. However, this does not make the identified ICGs less severe when trying to&#13;
achieve sectoral development objectives. It is well-documented that the civil service in&#13;
Argentina needs to be reorganized in line with other government efforts to modernize the&#13;
entire administrative machinery. Salary levels in the forestry sector are not at all&#13;
competitive with the private sector. As a result, the private sector retains the best&#13;
specialists, which is not necessarily a bad thing in itself However, as the role of the State&#13;
in the sector becomes leaner, the need for a competent core of specialists within sector&#13;
institutions is critical. Current personnel policies do not give any premium for the number&#13;
of years specialists have spent in the same job and/or specialty. The system is seen as&#13;
broadly unfair. Many of the existing higher- and mid-level specialists have a second job&#13;
working in private activities that have nothing to do with the forestry sector. This is&#13;
particularly serious in a sector in which a high level of competency is necessary to&#13;
implement reforms such as the ones under the proposed project, including policy-making,&#13;
definition of strategies to stimulate efficiently the private sector, and to enforce natural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                              Annex D&#13;
resource legislation and regulations. There is an acute need to hire and retain higher-level&#13;
professionals, but these cannot be attracted by the present levels of compensation.&#13;
Skills of Individuals in Both the Public and Private Sectors&#13;
27.   Finally, from the viewpoint of the last institutional capacity category that has been&#13;
reviewed while preparing the proposed project, namely, skills of people at all levels&#13;
involved in interinstitutional relationships, wide capacity gaps exist, largely, but not&#13;
exclusively, explained by the previously-described capacity gaps. Information obtained&#13;
through informal interviews of both public sector officials and private sector entrepreneurs&#13;
show that skills are missing at all levels, including in the private sector, to achieve the&#13;
development tasks implied in the Government priority objectives. The majority of&#13;
decision-makers are new to the sector. About 70 percent of the professionals and&#13;
technicians, including those in the private sector which is supposed to get the best&#13;
professionals as a result of better compensation packages, would need, at least, to update&#13;
their skills. In the private sector, managers do not have the management or technical skills&#13;
at the level required by an industry that wants to aggressively penetrate highly competitive&#13;
international markets. Workers in the industry are generally unskilled, contributing to a&#13;
well-known wastage of primary products. Finally, the population in general, including the&#13;
groups visiting national parks or other protected areas, have neither a conservation culture&#13;
nor awareness of what is expected from them as a contribution to natural resource&#13;
protection. In other words, the global skill capital of the people, including within the&#13;
sectoral institutional universe, is deficient. This probably will be a severe impediment to&#13;
implementing the proposed sectoral development strategy if it is not addressed speedily&#13;
and adequately.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
28.   The Argentine Forest Sector has a weak institutional capacity because: (a) the&#13;
sectoral role of the State and related development policy is only vaguely defined and is not&#13;
sufficiently explicit or transparent; (b) the institutional environment is which the sector is&#13;
developing is not conducive to the achievement of the highest development potential in&#13;
terms of preserving natural resources and, at the same time, realizing the sector's full&#13;
productive potential; and (c) the capacity of sectoral institutions is weak. Based on a&#13;
comparison between existing institutional capacity thus described for the sector, and the&#13;
one that is implied by the proposed project's development objectives, an institutional&#13;
strengthening strategy is recommended that would help: (a) define a clearer role of the&#13;
state and develop policy in effective consultation with the civil society; and (b) implement&#13;
the proposed action program described below and included in the proposed project so as&#13;
to eliminate, or at least mitigate, identified institutional capacity gaps for key capacity&#13;
elements such as policy-making, legislation/regulations, interinstitutional and internal&#13;
organization, personnel management, and skills.&#13;

E. Project Implementation Unit Component&#13;
29.   Because SNyAH has an ongoing institutional strengthening project with the Inter-&#13;
American Development Bank (IDB), partially financed with an US$30.0 million loan, the&#13;
government has requested that general institutional strengthening activities within&#13;
SRNyAH, including DRFN, be financed from the IDB loan. The government has agreed,&#13;
however, that a PIU would be included in the project.&#13;
Project Implementation Unit (US$2.2 million)&#13;
30.   This component would strengthen the capacity of DRFN and APN to manage and&#13;
coordinate project implementation. A PIU would be established to assist the managers of&#13;
DRFN and APN in implementing the project. The PIU would consist of a Project&#13;
Coordinator, two Technical Managers (one for DRFN and one for APN), an Accountant&#13;
and other technical and administrative consultants as necessary for project implementation.&#13;
31.   The Project Coordinator would be recruited locally for the coordination of&#13;
implementation for the duration of the Project and would be responsible for, inter alia: (i)&#13;
putting in place, and maintaining, a system for monitoring project implementation; (ii)&#13;
coordinating the preparation of POAs, bi-annual progress reports to the Bank, and the&#13;
production of audit reports; (iii) supervising the administration of the Special Account;&#13;
(iv) preparing, in cooperation with the Technical Managers, all documents for the Mid-&#13;
Term Review and ensuring their quality; and (v) completing, in cooperation with the&#13;
Technical Managers, Statistician, and Economist, in particular, an evaluation of the&#13;
Project at the end of its life. He/she would ultimately be the link between Bank&#13;
supervision staff and DRFN and APN.&#13;
32.   Each of the two Technical Managers would be recruited locally for almost the&#13;
duration of the project and would be responsible for ensuring the technical quality of all&#13;
project work under their respective areas of responsibility, namely, DRFN and APN, and,&#13;
in cooperation with the Project Coordinator, for preparing the required documentation for&#13;
the Mid-Term Review, and for preparing the project evaluation report at the end of the&#13;
project's life.&#13;
33.   The Accountant would be recruited locally for the duration of the Project and&#13;
would be responsible for financial record keeping, the Special Account, and disbursement&#13;
requests. All of these experts would work under the overall direction of the managers in&#13;
DRFN and APN.&#13;
34.   A Procurement Specialist would be recruited locally for a total of about 20 months&#13;
and would work part-time and be responsible for ensuring that procurement procedures&#13;
follow Bank guidelines, and for making recommendations on award of contracts to the&#13;
managers of DRFN and APN.&#13;
35.   A Statistician would be recruited internationally for about 20 months and would&#13;
work part-time and be responsible for ensuring statistical soundness of all research work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                            Annex D&#13;
under the project. The Statistician would be selected for his/her qualifications and&#13;
experience in the design and implementation of on-farm research either in Argentina or&#13;
elsewhere.&#13;
36.   An Economist would be recruited locally for almost the duration of the Project and&#13;
would be responsible for supervising the implementation of the studies on policies, laws&#13;
and regulations, and for the quality of all economic work under the project, particularly&#13;
the design of research proposals in the Chaco region sub-component. The Economist&#13;
would be selected for his/her qualifications and experience in environmental and natural&#13;
resource economics and their linkages to the efficient working of the overall economy.&#13;
37.   This component would also include provision for vehicles and equipment&#13;
(telephones, photocopiers, fax machines and computers) as required, for about&#13;
US$180,000, and include incremental operating costs for the PIU of US$160,000.&#13;

            Argentina - Native Forests and Protected

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Native Forests and
            Protected Areas Project for Argentina are to: a) help the
            Secretariat of Natural Resources and Human Environment
            prioritize its actions dealing with native forests; b)
            facilitate the development of an incentive and regulatory
            framework to encourage decision makers; both public and
            private, to more fully internalize within their decision
            making processes the full range of social costs and benefits
            associated with their decisions and actions affecting native
            forests; c) develop a plan for transforming the National
            Parks Administration into a world- class park management
            organization; and d) increase the environmentally
            sustainable level of tourism in four national parks. The
            project will have three components: a) generation and
            dissemination of research and information consisting of
            policy, legal and regulatory reform, a national inventory of
            native forests and establishment and operation of a related
            database; and applied research and studies to facilitate
            management and conservation of native forests and protected
            areas; b) protected areas comprised of the development of a
            plan for the modernization of the National Parks
            Administration and specific infrastructure development and
            management strengthening in four Patagonian Region parks;
            and c) project implementation.
