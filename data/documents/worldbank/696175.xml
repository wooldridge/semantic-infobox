LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:             Republic of Indonesia&#13;
Implementing          The Directorate General of Cipta Karya in the Ministry of Public Works is the&#13;
Agencies:             executing agency. The provincial governments of North, Central, Southeast and&#13;
South Sulawesi are the principal implementing agencies, with the participation of 40&#13;
local governments and their local water enterprises in 41 cities and towns.&#13;
Beneficiaries:        About 3.6 million residents in 41 towns and cities of 40 local governments of the&#13;
four Sulawesi provinces&#13;
Poverty:              PTI: The project targets the four provinces of Sulawesi which have a higher&#13;
incidence of poverty than the nation-wide average. The project's water supply and&#13;
sanitation sub-components will benefit the poor the most because it is they who are&#13;
without access to clean, affordable water and waste disposal facilities. The urban&#13;
neighborhood (kampung) and market improvement programs provide basic&#13;
infrastructure services that will improve the standard of living of the urban poor.&#13;
Amount:               US$155 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:                Payable in 20 years including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest&#13;
rate for currency pool loans.&#13;
Commitment Fee:       0.75% on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less any&#13;
waiver&#13;
Onlending Terms:      From the loan proceeds, US$3 1.0 million equivalent would be onlent by the central&#13;
government to the participating local governments and their water enterprises, at an&#13;
annual interest rate of 11.75%, for a term of 20 years, including five years grace.&#13;
Local governments and their water enterprises are fully responsible for the interest&#13;
during construction. Subsidiary Loans will be denominated and repayable in Rupiah.&#13;
Financing Plan:       Financial responsibilities for the individual subprojects are assigned in accordance&#13;
with an agreed system of functional responsibilities among the central, provincial,&#13;
and local governments (see para 4.28).&#13;
Economic Rate of      12% or more for water supply, and drainage, not quantified for other components&#13;

REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA&#13;
SECOND SULAWESI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1.  SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. URBAN SECTOR OVERVIEW&#13;
1.1    Demographic Trends. The current urban population of Indonesia exceeds 55 million, or nearly&#13;
30% of the national total population of 190 million. Indonesia's urban growth rates have accelerated&#13;
during the past 15 years, averaging more than 5 percent per year. About 80 million, or 40 percent of&#13;
Indonesians, will be city dwellers by the year 2000. Indonesia's urban settlements include 15 metropolitan&#13;
and large cities of at least half a million people, 40 secondary cities of 100,000 to 500,000 residents&#13;
(provincial capitals and incorporated municipalities), 200 smaller towns (mainly regency headquarters) of&#13;
20,000 to 100,000 population, and about 3,200 service centers and subdistrict headquarters with 3,000 to&#13;
20,000 people.&#13;
1.2   Institutional Framework.  At the national  level, there is no single ministry for urban&#13;
development. The National Development Planning Agency, BAPPENAS, is responsible for overall&#13;
planning and allocation of resources, focused within Five-Year Development Plans (REPELITA) and&#13;
Annual National Development Budgets (APBN).   Within BAPPENAS, the Bureau for Urban&#13;
Development, Settlement and Public Housing, under Deputy Chairman V (Regional and Provincial&#13;
Development), is responsible for oversight and coordination of urban infrastructure development, in&#13;
cooperation with other involved Bureaus (e.g. Transport under Deputy I). All key central agencies with&#13;
responsibilities in the urban sector are represented in the Inter-agency Coordinating Team for Urban&#13;
Development (Tim Koordinasi or TKPP) chaired by BAPPENAS.&#13;
1.3    The principal central ministries involved in urban issues are the Ministry of Home Affairs, the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works, and the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is&#13;
responsible for oversight of the regional governments, primarily through its Directorate General for Public&#13;
Administration and Regional Autonomy and Directorate General for Regional Development. The Ministry&#13;
of Public Works (MPW) is responsible for oversight of most infrastructure. Within MPW, the following&#13;
directorates general are responsible for urban infrastructure: the Directorate General for Human&#13;
Settlements (Cipta Karya or DGCK) is responsible for oversight of city and regional planning, wvater&#13;
supply, urban drainage, sanitation and sewerage, solid waste management, kampung improvement&#13;
programs (KIP), and market infrastructure improvement programs (MIIP); the Directorate General for&#13;
Roads (Bina Marga) is responsible for oversight of urban roads and bridges; and the Directorate General&#13;
for Water Resource Development (Pengairan) is responsible for urban flood control and bulk water supply.&#13;
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is responsible for central and local finance; the Directorate General for&#13;
Budget (Anggaran) administers budget transfers.&#13;
1.4    At the regional levels, provincial (Level 1) and local (Level 11) governments operate with&#13;
increasing responsibilities and delegated authority.  In all, there are 27 provinces and 304 local&#13;
governments, including 57 kotamadyas (cities) and 247 kabupatens (regencies). Legislative powers at both&#13;
provincial and local levels are held by elected People's Representative Councils (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat&#13;
Daerah).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.5    Under Indonesia's unitary system of government. all units of sub-national government are within&#13;
the Ministry of Home Affairs. Provincial governments arc headed by appointed governors who represent&#13;
the President and the central government; the governors also hcad the scmi-autonomous provincial&#13;
administrations. Bupatis (regency heads) and Walikotas (city niavors) represent provincial governments,&#13;
and also head their oxvn local govcrnments. Regional Development Planning Agencics (BAPPEDA I and&#13;
11) report directly to their respective govcrnors, regency hcads or mavors. and are responlsible for planning&#13;
and resource allocation, while the senior administrative officer at cach levcl is thc Rcgional Secretary&#13;
(Sekwilda I and 11). Regional govcrnment services arc providcd by separate departmicnits (Dinas I and 11)&#13;
analogous to line ministrics of the central government.&#13;
1.6    Sectoral Coordination and Local Participation. Due to the hierarchical administrative system,&#13;
coordination of the urban sector has been difficult. The large size and diversity of the country, the rapid&#13;
pace of urbanization, the number of concerncd agencies. poor resource allocation, and cultural constraints&#13;
to effective communication within and among agcncies, have all lcd to a somewhat fragmentcd approach to&#13;
urban development. In order to improve coordination and targeting of resourccs to local urban services&#13;
needs, the Government of Indoiiesia's (GOI) policy of deccntralization needs to bc pursued more&#13;
effectively.&#13;
1.7    Increasingly, it is becoming apparent from  worldwide dcvelopment experience that effective&#13;
community involvement leads to improved service provision. GOI's desire to dccentralize, requires the&#13;
adoption of practical means of public participation, with incrcased accountability of local leaders and&#13;
government staff  By cntering into constructive dialogue with the community, officials are also able to&#13;
better plan and program needed service improvements. GOI regulations for annual development budget&#13;
preparation (the RAKORBANG process) call for community consultation and participation at all levels,&#13;
but implementation of this process is uneven and generally poor.&#13;
1.8    Sector Constraints and Priorities. Averagc incomes in urban arcas have risen substantially over&#13;
the past decade; however. income distribution remains relativelv skewed and in 1990. morc than 17 percent&#13;
of Indonesian urban dwellers were estimated to live in "absolute poverty" based on thcir expenditure levels.&#13;
The problems of low income are exacerbated by deficiencies in basic services and degraded environmental&#13;
conditions. Country-wide, only about 20-25 percent of urban households have direct access to piped water&#13;
supply, another 15 percent buy drinking water from vendors or standposts, and the rcst rely on shallow&#13;
wells and sometimes on surface water courses. Surface water courses in urban areas are almost always&#13;
severely polluted due to inadequately treated wastewater and illegally dumpcd solid waste. Only about 40&#13;
percent of urban households have access to adequate sanitation facilities. In the larger cities, inadequate&#13;
industrial water supply, and liquid and solid waste disposal are serious problems. To mect GOI's service&#13;
and equity objectives, more investment is needed in local systems.  The Bank's 1993 Urban Public&#13;
Infrastructure Services Report (No. 12154-lND) estimated that the 1990 infrastructurc investment backlog&#13;
was at least some US$5 billion for the main five subsectors (piped wvater supply, sanitation, solid waste,&#13;
urban roads, and drainage). Further, a substantial backlog prevails in the maintenancc of facilities, which&#13;
has resulted in decreased productivity of previous infrastructure investments.&#13;
1.9    Sector Finances. Finances of provincial and local govcrnments have long been dominated by&#13;
central government transfers and are characterized by weak local resource mobilization, low per-capita&#13;
budgets and limited use of credit for capital investment. The traditionally dominant role played by central&#13;
government financing of local government infrastructure is partly due to the GOI unitary system which&#13;
limits local authority for levying taxes. Grants and other revenue sharing mechanisms used by GOI are&#13;
intended to resolve the disparity between increasingly decentralized service responsibilities and local&#13;
resource mobilization. Although grant allocation criteria have been modified to respond better to local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
needs and shortfalls (compared to minimum standards), there is a need to more closely relate grant&#13;
allocations to local performance and economic productivity requirements.&#13;
1.10   Urban Infrastructure Issues. The main problems and issues faced by all Indonesian urban areas&#13;
are: (a) serious infrastructure deficiencies and Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) backlogs; (b) lack of&#13;
coordination in integrating infrastructure investments with land management and transport objectives; (c)&#13;
no administrative status for urban areas, other than the largest cities (Kotamadya); (d) weak management&#13;
of water enterprises; (e) poor financial management including deficient accounting practices, lack of&#13;
adequate cost recovery. weak revcnue generation, and little use of credit, as well as poor inforrnation&#13;
systems; (f) inefficient programming of the design and construction cycles, often compressed into single&#13;
fiscal years; (g) complex relationships among local, provincial and central agencies with respect to&#13;
responsibilities for project and program preparation, appraisal, financing, implementation, and O&amp;M; and&#13;
(h) shortage of traincd and expericnced managerial and technical personnel at all levels.&#13;
1.11   Local governments are required by MHA to prepare and implement Revenue Improvement Action&#13;
Plans (RIAPs) to improve revenues under their own administration. While this has improved the situation&#13;
in some local governments, there is still much room for further local revenue growth. Restructuring of&#13;
central-local government financial relationships and improved fiscal capacities for local governments in&#13;
Indonesia are topics of on-going policy dialogue which are gaining increased urgency as growth in urban&#13;
services requirements outpace local capacities to respond. The larger infrastructure projects are still often&#13;
financed directly from the national budget (APBN/DIP) and are executed by the regional offices of central&#13;
government agencies (Kanwil) for subsequent transfer to the local government. However, these projects&#13;
frequently lead to land acquisition and/or O&amp;M obligations which the local governments are not fully&#13;
capable of undertaking. Local government borrowing capacities are generally quite limited and incentives&#13;
to borrow are weak in the current financing pattern, although some capable local governments are willing&#13;
to accelerate their development program by borrowing.&#13;
B. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
1.12   IUIDP Approach.  With large deficiencies in urban infrastructure and a fast-growing urban&#13;
population, GOI's strategy in the past has emphasized physical infrastructure targets: length of roads to be&#13;
built, percentage of population to be supplied with piped water, sanitation services, etc. These targets have&#13;
a prominent place in the REPELITAs. In 1987, GOI issued a statement of urban policies, representing a&#13;
consolidated vicwv of development in the sector.  This Policy Statement for Urban Development,&#13;
incorporated in REPELITA V (for the period 1989-94) includes. (a) strengthening local governments to&#13;
build, operate and maliltain local services; (b) improving the planning and programming of urban&#13;
infrastructure investments; (c) mobilization of local revenues and the optimization of their use; and (d)&#13;
strengthening consultative processes at various levels of government, particularly the participation of&#13;
municipalities and regencies.&#13;
1.13   GOI's Policy Statement called for Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Programs (IUIDP)&#13;
as the operational approach for achieving the above objectives. The policy was translated into action plans&#13;
for local institutional strengthening (Local Institutional Development Action Plan or LIDAP) and&#13;
improvements in local resource mobilization (RIAP). sector programming, and financing arrangements.&#13;
GOI has also provided (wvith domestic funds) further support to the reform effort of the local government&#13;
revenue departments, initiated under the Fifth Urban Project (Ln. 2408-IND). In the current five-year plan&#13;
(REPELITA VI), GOI has continued to develop the IUIDP process to emphasize the following priorities:&#13;
(a) expanding the scope of the IUIDP process to includc additional subsectors vhicch are important in&#13;
promoting the economic development of cities; (b) strengthcning local government institutional capabilities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
(c) improving O&amp;M of urban infrastructure; (d) improving cost recovery and implementation of a more&#13;
fully integrated system for the financing of urban infrastructure services; and (e) increasing attention to&#13;
urban land and environmental management.  GOI is also encouraging experimentation by local&#13;
governments with various mechanisms for private sector participation in urban services delivery.&#13;
Community participation is also being actively promoted.&#13;
1.14   GOI also issued regulations and policy clarifications to operationalize urban sector policy and the&#13;
IUIDP approach. With World Bank, Asian Development Bank and bilateral assistance. GOI has created a&#13;
nation-wide program for IUIDP preparation and implementation beginning in 1987, and more recently the&#13;
United Nations Development Program/United Nations Commission for Human Settlements (Habitats) and&#13;
the Bank supported a central assistance team to the IUIDP process led by TKPP at BAPPENAS. To date&#13;
more than 75 percent of all local governments have completed at least one round of IUIDP program&#13;
preparation and initiated implementation.&#13;
1.15   Local Borrowing. Under REPELITA V, GOI also gave priority to the expansion of borrowing by&#13;
local governments and their water enterprises (PDAMs). To induce a higher level of credit financing, GOI&#13;
adopted less conservative financial criteria for borrowing by local entities (debt service coverage ratio of&#13;
not less than 1.5 for local government general fund operations and not less than 1.3 for local enterprises&#13;
such as PDAMs). This has brought the legal borrowing capacitv of local governments, particularly the&#13;
larger municipalities, more in line with their considerably underutilized financial capacity. There is,&#13;
nevertheless, a natural preference for grant financing on the part of local governments, especially for&#13;
investments that do not directly generate revenues through service charges. GOI's intent is to fix medium&#13;
and long-term interest rates for local governments and their enterprises at a level approximating market&#13;
rates for development borrowings, but suitable reference rates reflecting market conditions for long-term&#13;
borrowing are only now emerging from recent public sector bond sales. MOF sets fixed rates for local&#13;
government borrowings each year for loans initiated during that y'ear; for the past two years the rate has&#13;
been 11.75% which has been positive in real terms and generally approximates market borrowing costs.&#13;
1.16   REPELITA VI. REPELITA VI and the second 25 Year National Development Plan, both of&#13;
which started in April 1994, emphasize sustainable urban development through improvement in the quality&#13;
of the living environment, support for economic growth, reduction in regional development disparities, and&#13;
poverty alleviation. Perhaps the most significant change reflected in REPELITA VI is to shift the focus of&#13;
GOI urban programs from overcoming current service deficits to a more forward-looking emphasis on the&#13;
investments needed to realize the economic potential of urban areas, including their functions as service&#13;
centers for regional development. While continuing the basic premises of REPELITA V and the National&#13;
Policy Statement for Urban Development mentioned above, REPELITA VI takes a more strategic approach&#13;
by expanding the IUIDP into an Integrated Urban Development Program (IUDP) that includes: (a) a larger&#13;
number of smaller cities and towns. (b) broader spatial planning and urban planning in addition to public&#13;
works infrastructure development plans; (c) expanding the scope of Kampung Improvement Program (KIP)&#13;
to cover low income and rental housing, infrastructure provision for low-income areas, and urban renewal;&#13;
(d) involving the private sector and communities to a greater extent; and (e) strengthening environmental&#13;
sustainability. To accelerate decentralization and implementation of plans, emphasis is being placed on&#13;
better use of resources, mobilization of local revenues, developing financing mechanisms, and increasing&#13;
cost recovery by municipalities and their agencies. Better coordination and strengthening of local agencies&#13;
is also being sought. Financing policies towards urban services emphasize local government revenue&#13;
improvement as well as greater efficiency in the deployment of the revenues; and more use of the central&#13;
government lending and special urban grant mechanisms as the means of financing urban development&#13;
under local management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.17   For at least 20 years, GOI has been promoting aggressive economic development in the Eastern&#13;
Islands (especially Sulawesi and Irian Jaya). REPELITA VI - as well as IV and V before - contains a&#13;
development strategy for the Eastern Islands. Growth in the Eastern Islands is considered important to both&#13;
harness the natural resources of the region, and to provide socio-economic development opportunities&#13;
comparable to Java's (largely an equity issue). The GOI has identified 'Kawasan Andalan"' which are&#13;
areas where strategic investments in infrastructure might anchor a regional strategy and promote wider&#13;
development objectives. The 'lava development model" of export oriented manufacturing is not suitable&#13;
for the Eastern Islands, and thus the Government is pursuing alternative growth strategies. Recognizing the&#13;
deficiencies in the provision of urban infrastructure services and the need for focused development&#13;
strategies in the Eastern Islands, the GOI has placed a high priority on improving the infrastructure of&#13;
Sulawesi's urban centers.&#13;
1.18   Environment and Resettlement. In late 1993, GOI enacted Law 51/93 on environmental impact&#13;
assessment, mitigation and monitoring measures, and Presidential Decree (KEPRES) 55 on land acquisition&#13;
and compensation for public facilities, to improve on earlier decrees and their application. Law 51/93&#13;
makes refinements to GOI's environmental assessment procedures, which are now substantially consistent&#13;
with World Bank policies and best practices under Bank-financed projects. Decree 55 seeks to ensure that&#13;
persons affected by project land acquisition have adequate access to information, fair negotiations,&#13;
compensation awards based on market values, and rights of appeal to the courts. KEPRES 55 still has&#13;
gaps, primarily in the areas of entitlement eligibility, compensation calculations and funding sources, when&#13;
compared with the Bank's Operational Directive 4.30, and time will be required to develop implementation&#13;
capacities based on local cxperiences. The proposed Second Sulawesi Urban Development Project&#13;
(SULUDP-2) will assist the four Sulawesi provinces and the local governments to fully comply with GOI&#13;
and related Bank requirements for environment and resettlement issues.&#13;
1.19   The Second East Java Urban Development Project (Ln. 4017-IND) has been instrumental in&#13;
encouraging the Province of East Java to draft - in close consultation with the Bank - and subsequently&#13;
adopt a Govemor's Decree on resettlement. This Decree is now being adopted in the four Provinces of&#13;
Sulawesi. The SULUDP-2 includes a five-year assistance strategy to enhance and operationalize the&#13;
dialogue on resettlement. Promising results have already been seen during project preparation. The local&#13;
government concerned, with the assistance of DGCK, and the preparation consultants, has prepared a&#13;
resettlement action plan for the town of Luwuk. Bank staff have also discussed resettlement options, as&#13;
well as their costs and implications, in Luwuk, Bitung, and Sengkang, where resettlement schemes were&#13;
initially proposed but not yet confirmed.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

2.   BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE&#13;
A. PAST INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1    Overall Sector Experience. The Bank has been involved in the urban water supply sector since&#13;
the 1960s, with relatively little change in approach. While many projects have provided substantial&#13;
economic and health benefits, the experience indicates: (a) supply of water has lagged behind increasing&#13;
demand; (b) delays in project implementation are common; (c) improving institutions and achieving cost-&#13;
recovery have been slow, difficult and neglected; (d) water quality is a persistent problem; and (e) disposal&#13;
of waste water and solid waste in urban areas is difficult (Operations Evaluation Department (OED)&#13;
Review of Water Supply, Report No. 10789).&#13;
2.2    Bank involvement in the urban sector started in the early 1970s with low cost investment projects&#13;
in shelter, water supply, sanitation, and urban transport, aimed at alleviating urban poverty. Sites and&#13;
services and slum upgrading projects were to demonstrate replicable approaches benefiting the poor, while&#13;
recovering costs and reducing the financial burden on the public sector. Many of these projects succeeded&#13;
in physical terms, but had little impact on the policies of national and local governments. The Bank had not&#13;
paid adequate attention to the policy and institutional requirements for improving the productivity of the&#13;
urban economy and reducing urban poverty, and improving management of the urban environment.&#13;
Further, as many of the urban programs did not achieve sustainable policy reform and institutional&#13;
development, project approaches were generally not replicable outside the framework of Bank financial&#13;
support (OED Twenty Years of Urban Sector Lending, Report No. 13117).&#13;
2.3    By the mid-1980s the experience of donor-assisted projects had led to shifts in approaches in the&#13;
urban sector. It was recognized that central governments alone were unable to meet the increasing needs&#13;
for infrastructure services of rapidly growing urban populations and greater efforts had to be devoted to:&#13;
(a) improving the management capability of urban institutions and inter-governmental fiscal relations; (b)&#13;
improving local resource mobilization; (c) enhancing the management and quality of urban infrastructure,&#13;
particularly with regard to maintenance; (d) establishing enabling, rather than constraining, regulatory&#13;
frameworks; (e) expanding financial services for urban development; and (f) promoting private sector&#13;
participation in urban service delivery. Recent initiatives by governments and donors in these areas reflect&#13;
a growing appreciation of the importance of policies, institutions, and regulations in formulating effective&#13;
strategies to manage urban growth.&#13;
2.4    Experience in Indonesia. The Bank has financed 13 completed and 10 ongoing urban and water&#13;
supply projects in Indonesia since 1974, for more than 70 local governments and many of their water&#13;
enterprises (see Annex 1). Urban lending operations in Indonesia have progressed from demonstration&#13;
projects in Jakarta through more programmatic investments in selected other large cities, to sector lending&#13;
within an agreed policy and institutional framework (although still limited in terms of area and subsectoral&#13;
scope). Water supply projects initially covered only a few cities at a time, but later, like Bank projects in&#13;
other countries, assisted a large number of urban settlements under one operation. Details concerning the&#13;
impact of the previous generation of Bank-funded urban infrastructure projects are available from a study&#13;
carried out by OED in September 1995 entitled, 'lndonesia: Impact Evaluation Report, Enhancing the&#13;
Quality of Life in Urban Indonesia - The Legacy of Kampung Improvement Program", (Report no. 14747-&#13;
IND). In urban transport projects, or the transport components of urban development projects, attention&#13;
has focused on road construction and traffic management and maintenance. Even so, implementation of&#13;
road schemes was slower than expected, and quality of construction has frequently been the cause of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
reduced facility life span. Adequate attention was not been given to improvement of public transport&#13;
services and facilities for non-motorized vehicles or pedestrians.&#13;
2.5    Bank experience confirms that: (a) limited planning and implementation capacity at the central&#13;
government level, and the difficulties inherent in providing essentially local services by central govemment&#13;
departments, reduces the efficiency of mass delivery programs; (b) capacity building at the local level is a&#13;
long-term process that needs to be accompanied by structural and institutional strengthening to achieve an&#13;
increase in local responsibility and accountability; and (c) to develop such responsibility and&#13;
accountability, central-local financial relations need to provide more local government autonomy and&#13;
enable private sector involvement. Furthermore, the OED impact cvaluation report, cited above, concluded&#13;
that under conditions of rapid economic development, targeted urban sector improvement programs can&#13;
have a very positive impact on low-income areas, and that those impacts can be achieved at a low cost of&#13;
investment that reaps high economic rates of return.&#13;
2.6    The OED retrospective on 20 years of urban lending documents the following highlights of the&#13;
impact of 115 completed urban projects which have helped in the formulation of the Bank's assistance&#13;
strategy for urban development in Indonesia in general and the proposed project in particular. First, an&#13;
important achievement of urban projects was cost-effective service delivery and increase in the low-cost&#13;
urban infrastructure stock. Second, repeater projects not only help sustain nascent institutional innovations&#13;
but also allow them to be scaled up and diffused more widely. (The Sulawesi-Irian Jaya Urban&#13;
Development Project (SIJUDP) (Ln. 3340-ND) had nine participating local governments; the proposed&#13;
project deepens assistance to these and broadens it to an additional 32 local governments). Third, despite&#13;
the priority accorded to institutional development by the Bank's urban sector policies and despite its being&#13;
a goal of two thirds of the projects studied, it was achieved in less than a third. Fourth, an excessive&#13;
emphasis on physical targets is detrimental to institutional and financial (cost-recovery) goals. Finally, not&#13;
only is it necessary to give explicit attention to environmental implications but it must also integrate the&#13;
social and technical aspects.  Experience also showed that competent and dynamic local leadership,&#13;
complemented by good technical staff was an important ingredient for positive outcomes. A further lesson&#13;
from SIJUDP was that the virtual lack of a formal role for the provincial level left the local government&#13;
mostly on their own, since Bank and central government supervision visits were infrequent. Reporting and&#13;
monitoring was also much more difficult without active provincial level involvement.&#13;
2.7    The Sulawesi Urban Experience. Specific to urban development in Sulawesi communities, the&#13;
Bank has funded the already completed Water Supply II (Ln. 1709-IND), Urban III (Ln. 1653-IND), and&#13;
Urban V (Ln. 2408-ND) during the 1980s, and the ongoing SIJUDP. Experience has shown that one of&#13;
the most effective ways to strengthen local institutions is through well prepared and well-targeted project-&#13;
type interventions, while at the same time, providing general management advice and support. The need&#13;
for locally and regionally sensitive support is particularly important for the Eastern Islands including&#13;
Sulawesi. Implementation of SIJUDP and preparation of this project have already highlighted the&#13;
difficulties and opportunities associated with Sulawesi's topography and largely agrarian make-up. The&#13;
most effective approaches in the SIJUDP are hands-on, practical on-the-job training and operational&#13;
advice.&#13;
2.8    The proposed project design takes into account these lessons.  Significant responsibility in&#13;
subproject selection and implementation will be handled by the local governments and their water&#13;
enterprises with provincial support in the proposed programmatic approach to this project; suitable&#13;
assistance in project management, local revenue administration, and improvements in operations and&#13;
maintenance will be provided; and management advisory services will be provided to the water enterprises.&#13;
Many of the towns have relatively weak institutions. Efforts will be made to ensure that on-going&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
provincial assistance is available, as well as maximizing transferal of lessons learned in one town to&#13;
another.&#13;
B. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND RATIONALE&#13;
2.9    Bank Sector Strategy. The Bank has oriented its overall sector lending to assist the Government&#13;
to deliver adequate urban infrastructure services in cost-effective ways. GOI and the Bank emphasize&#13;
improvements in: (a) service levels, particularly for the poor; (b) urban productivity and the effectiveness of&#13;
investments through better infrastructure planning and programming, especially at the city level, (c)&#13;
enhanced local government capacity for fiscal management, revenue mobilization, project implementation&#13;
and O&amp;M; (d) the urban environment by improving local government capacity to plan, build and operate&#13;
infrastructure in an environmentally sound fashion; and (e) enhanced community participation.&#13;
2.10   In promoting efficient urban development, the Bank's strategy supports the expanded IUDP&#13;
approach; however, implementation should include both sectoral and integrated approaches as&#13;
appropriate. For example, in smaller municipalities multisectoral projects are generally of manageable size&#13;
and complexity; an integrated investment approach would, therefore, be more appropriate. In other cases,&#13;
where the requirements of a particular sector are sufficiently large and complex, both in technical terms as&#13;
well as on policy, institutional and financial matters, sectoral projects within the framework of an&#13;
integrated plan may be better suited to implementation capacities.&#13;
2.11   The Bank's urban development financing  strategy emphasizes increased  local resource&#13;
mobilization through the improvement and efficient deployment of local government and water enterprise&#13;
own-source revenues, including appropriate use of the enhanced borrowing capacities which will arise as a&#13;
consequence of the improvements in revenue. Even with such improvements, however, given Indonesia's&#13;
fiscal incentives the capacities of the local institutions to contribute to the financing of the extensive urban&#13;
infrastructure deficiencies will in most cases remain limited for the foreseeable future, occasioning a&#13;
continuing need for supplementary special assistance from the central government in the form of non-&#13;
repayable financing contributions. Recognizing the need for such special assistance to be structured so as&#13;
to provide an incentive for the mobilization of improved local revenues into the urban infrastructure&#13;
sectors, as well as to promote the objective of decentralization of responsibilities to the local level, the Bank&#13;
continues to support the provision of the assistance in the form of financial investment grants which&#13;
complement local revenues and borrowing from the central level, with the implementation of the grants&#13;
being managed by the local institutions. In all these respects the Bank's strategy is fully in accord with the&#13;
policies enunciated in REPELITA VI.&#13;
2.12   The Bank's strategy also promotes establishing an enabling regulatory and planning framework for&#13;
urban land management. A key focus of the Bank's strategy will be to support GOI efforts to establish an&#13;
effective land management system and simplify other regulations to facilitate more efficient and&#13;
environmentally sound urban land use and strengthen land tenure.  The Bank is also assisting the&#13;
Government to develop improved implementation frameworks for addressing environmental and social&#13;
impacts of urban projects.&#13;
2.13   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project's objectives are consistent with the Bank's 1995&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed in March 1995, and its Progress Report discussed on June 4,&#13;
1996. They envisage that the lending for infrastructure will remain a large part of the Indonesia program&#13;
and 'Wvithin infrastructure, there will be a shift in emphasis towards improving the quality of urban services&#13;
and dealing with issues such as improving water quality and waste management." The CAS also highlights&#13;
the need for improving public service delivery especially to the poor, greater decentralization of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
responsibilities, and improved environmental management. These are also the cornerstones of the evolving&#13;
GOI urban policy agenda to which the Bank has provided critical support and strategic input during the&#13;
past two decades. In the urban sector, the Bank therefore supports the integrated urban development&#13;
concept and enhancing coordination of planning, implementation and supervision among all levels of&#13;
government, in order to improve the delivery of urban services and enable local governments to assume&#13;
greater responsibly for urban management&#13;
2.14   The proposed project would help GOI meet these needs in the four provinces of Sulawesi by&#13;
emphasizing: the decentralization of responsibility for project management and implementation; the&#13;
integration of environmental considerations in urban development; the strengthening of local government&#13;
institutions and human resources for urban management; the improved access to services, priced at an&#13;
affordable level to lower income groups and under-serviced areas, as well as new development areas;&#13;
community participation in urban investment programs; the important linkages between rural agricultural&#13;
activities and urban services; and the generation of resources for infrastructure investment. The thrust of&#13;
the project is also consistent with the poverty alleviation and environmental improvement objectives of the&#13;
country assistance strategy as the project includes targeted interventions designed to improve the standard&#13;
of living and the quality of the environment in all project towns.&#13;
2.15   As noted earlier (para 1.13-1.16), an important GOI objective for the infrastructure sector in&#13;
REPELITA VI is to enhance the role of the private sector in the provision of public services which is a&#13;
growing phenomenon in East Asia. Bank advice has been sought in three areas, namely shifting the&#13;
appropriate balance between public and private roles; developing sector policy and regulatory framework;&#13;
and analyzing financial (including debt) implications. The Bank has helped prepare framework papers for&#13;
private participation in power, ports and solid waste management. Workshops for central and regional&#13;
government officials have been organized in these sectors as well as water supply where GOI is seeking to&#13;
involve private operations both in operation and financing, but progress has been slow to-date. Within&#13;
urban services the other areas where opportunities are most likely to be pursued are solid waste and&#13;
management of markets.  The size and economic base of most of the urban centers in Sulawesi&#13;
participating in the proposed project, as well as the general stage of evolution of local administration in&#13;
Indonesia, are such that relatively simple and small schemes, more alien to outsourcing or contracting out&#13;
major private investments in fixed assets, and involving more local capital and entrepreneurial talent than&#13;
foreign or even Java based conglomerates, are likely to be realized. Even this will require a shift in&#13;
attitudes, basic changes in the way things are done, as well as sustained and significant amounts of small&#13;
scale "hands-on" technical assistance, which will be provided under the proposed project.&#13;
2.16  In recent years Sulawesi has been important for advancing efforts attempted by the Bank in&#13;
support of regional development off-Java particularly in the Eastem Islands. New initiatives in this regard&#13;
include the rural Water Supply and Sanitation to Low Income Communities (WSSLIC) (Ln. 3929-IND)&#13;
project, and regional supervision in South Sulawesi. Experience is showing that a more locally sensitive&#13;
and consistent assistance strategy is needed for regions such as Sulawesi.  The Bank's continued&#13;
involvement in Sulawesi builds on the considerable lessons to date, and ensures a continued development&#13;
effort commensurate with local needs and capabilities. The GOI and the Bank recognize that development&#13;
in Sulawesi (and the rest of the Eastem Islands) is a slow process and that issues such as cost recovery and&#13;
capacity building will require sustained efforts over a longer period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.  URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN SULAWESI&#13;
A. GEOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC SETTING&#13;
3.1    The result of two tectonic plates crashing together, Sulawesi's complex geological history has&#13;
given rise to a strangely shaped island of some 181,000 km2 surface area, with a coastline of over 5,000 km&#13;
in length.' Sulawesi's topography ranges from coastal plains to mountains in excess of 3,000 meters&#13;
elevation; 83% of the island exhibits slopes of more than 15°. The island straddles the equator; the tropical&#13;
climate, fertile lowland soils, and relative isolation have produced a rich and unique ecological tapestry.&#13;
The cultural fabric of Sulawesi with its unique ethnic traditions is also a valuable heritage, with important&#13;
examples of the sea-faring Bugis and the ritualistic animists of Tana Toraja. Like much of the rest of&#13;
Eastern Indonesia, Sulawesi's geography is the single most important factor shaping local development.&#13;
3.2    The entire island of Sulawesi (formerly Celebes) now has an overall population of about 13.5&#13;
million. While the island has considerable mineral wealth, most of the population derives its livelihood&#13;
from  harvesting biological resources, viz agriculture, forestry and fishing.  Most of the limited&#13;
manufacturing base is small-scale and related to agroprocessing. The development of service industries to&#13;
date has been inhibited by difficult inland communications and dominated by government.&#13;
Administratively, the island of Sulawesi is made up of four provinces: North Sulawesi (Utara), Central&#13;
Sulawesi (Tengah), Southeast Sulawesi (Tenggara), and South Sulawesi (Selatan).&#13;
3.3    South Sulawesi with the largest urban population (2,220,244) has a diversified economy more&#13;
characteristic of core regions within Indonesia. Most economic activity centers on Ujung Pandang in the&#13;
south-east of the province. The city, largest in the country east of Surabaya, had been nominated as the&#13;
"principle gateway center" to serve the Eastern Islands. Overall, South Sulawesi has a relatively complex&#13;
and sophisticated economy evolved over 500 years as a trading region. However, recent growth has been&#13;
slower, but the manufacturing sector continues to develop. In rural areas, sub-regional specialization&#13;
allows the production of a wide range of cash and food crops including a net rice surplus. The customs and&#13;
scenery of Tana Toraja in the northem part of the province attracts increasing number of foreign and local&#13;
visitors.&#13;
3.4    Central Sulawesi (urban population 345,957) is defined by its geography.  The extent, and&#13;
particularly the quality, of development land is extremely limited. Land communications are difficult, and&#13;
in some cases impossible due to seasonal flooding and erosion. Nevertheless, the province has recently&#13;
experienced rapid economic growith in the small manufacturing sector where previously there was just&#13;
subsistence agriculture.  The sector is based on the emergence of relatively high-productivity agro-&#13;
processing. This is in marked contrast to the situation in the 1970s and 80s. It may represent a unique&#13;
development path for the province. but it is more likely that growth will slow substantially as base figures&#13;
rise. Population and economic activity is heavily concentrated in the city of Palu, the provincial capital,&#13;
where the topography has produced an unusual tropical desert climate.&#13;
3.5    North Sulawesi (urban population 761,218) contains the second principal urban centers in the&#13;
region in the form of Manado and Bitung, with its deep water port. There is also a growing tourism sector&#13;
centered on Bunaken National Marine Park. However, there are few secondary centers and the economy is&#13;
based on a limited range of commodities (e.g. tree crops) which have proved to be vulnerable to the ups and&#13;
Sulawesi's coastline complexity ratio is an extreme 3.39. coastline complexity is calculated by dividing the&#13;
actual coastline length of an island by the circumference of a circle of equal area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
downs of world markets. Land area limits future expansion of the agricultural sector, forcing continued&#13;
emigration. Distance from markets constrains the growth of alternative employment for the generally well-&#13;
educated population.&#13;
3.6    Southeast Sulawesi (urban population 282,625) is the least developed of the four Sulawesi&#13;
provinces. The economy is currently focused on the relatively accessible off-shore islands rather than the&#13;
mainland.  This arrangement is characteristic of maritime regions at this earlv level of economic&#13;
development. The direct access to South Sulawesi via the Trans-Sulawesi Highway provides the first road&#13;
link to the Province, (previously access was via a route from Ujung Pandang, incorporating a section by&#13;
ferry across the Bone Bay, to link into the mainland towns of Kolaka and Kendari). The Province remains&#13;
relatively isolated, with poor communications and a mostly dispersed population.&#13;
3.7    With increasing regional economic integration in East Asia, Sulawesi is expected to be a key part&#13;
of the ASEAN economic growth arca known as BIMP EAGA (made up of Brunei, Indonesia [Sulawesi,&#13;
Maluku, Kalimantan], Malaysia [Sarawak, Sabah], and [Southemi Philippines). Activities under this new&#13;
initiative have already been limited by infrastructure constraints in towns such as Bitung (water supply for&#13;
tuna canning). Such commercial demands on infrastructure add to the already large backlog, and&#13;
foreshadow future demands for residential services. For example. as demographics change, the number of&#13;
households is increasing in Sulawesi more than twice as fast as the population growth.&#13;
B. URBAN AREAS&#13;
3.8    The urban population of all four Sulawesi provinces combined is around 3.6 million and growing&#13;
by more than 5% per year. Almost half of the urban residents live in the two largest cities, Ujung Pandang&#13;
and Manado, located at opposite ends of the island in South and North Sulawesi respectively and separated&#13;
by some 900 air kilometers or over 1300 kilometers of arduous roads.  Sulawesi is less developed&#13;
economically than the Inner Islands (i.e. Java and Bali), which is reflected in its urban settlement patterns&#13;
as well, and the incidence of urban poverty is substantially higher than the national average.&#13;
3.9    Despite large and continuing government investments in Sulawesi, the impact on regional&#13;
development has been less than expected. Few developmental '"pin-off' benefits have accrued from&#13;
resource extraction. Geographical disadvantages (relative isolation and rugged topography), infrastructure&#13;
deficiencies, e.g. poor ports, and difficult roads, as well as administrative disincentives, e.g. restrictions on&#13;
direct exports, are all severe impediments to regional development.&#13;
3.10   Urban areas in Sulawesi have an important supporting role for rural economic development.&#13;
Primary and secondary towns often serve large areas and populations. Agricultural and natural renewable&#13;
resource activities still remain the cornerstone of the region's economy and urban centers are therefore&#13;
critical in supplying communication, administrative, marketing and transport services. A recent study has&#13;
identified four main models of characteristic growth paths for the development of Sulawesi's urban centers&#13;
and their surrounding areas: (i) administrative service centers, (ii) agricultural service centers, (iii) special&#13;
function centers, e.g. tourism, transport, mining, and (iv) economic transformation (where local initiatives&#13;
supported by appropriate investment are mobilized to address economic stagnation or decline).&#13;
3.11   The principal emphasis of the sub-regional strategy is on medium/small towns as centers which&#13;
link rural economic activities with main centers in pursuit of integrated regional development.&#13;
Complementary elements also deal with the larger urban centers, inter-urban links, market access, and&#13;
helping to build a balanced hierarchy of towns and cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
3.12   The urban structure and hierarchy in Sulawesi have been largely defined by the predominantly&#13;
rural economic basc. low population density across much of the regions and topographical and&#13;
communication constraints. The principal features of this structure are: (i) a relative dominance of a few&#13;
provincial cclters (population over 100,000) which capture and are, in turn, dominated by a high&#13;
concentration of trade and public/private service activity. (ii) a limited, but increasingly significant, number&#13;
of sccondarn ccnters (all cities and/or regency capitals) which, bcsides their administrative roles, can be&#13;
largely justified in terms of their specialist economic functions and/or in terms of overall size and relative&#13;
concentration of catchment area population; and (iii) a residual of smaller towns (generally in the order of&#13;
15.(0() to 3(.000() population), which include all the remaining regcncy capitals but little else.&#13;
C. URBAN SERVICES&#13;
3.13    The ongoing SIJUDP aimed to meet priority urban infrastructure needs in nine Sulawesi towns.&#13;
There arc still significant backlogs in the provision of urban infrastructure services in these towns, as well&#13;
as in most of the othcr urban ccnters which have not yet benefited from  targeted, integrated urban&#13;
infrastructurc invcstments. For example, in the water supply subsector, piped water connection coverage&#13;
is typically bclow: 40%. and many distribution systems show unaccounted-for-water (UFW) in the range&#13;
of 40%. duc to physical and administrative losses. Urban roads are in a state of serious deterioration due&#13;
to the lack of sufficiClnt O&amp;M or due to inadequate capacity; manv towns also lack essential network links -&#13;
there are ftcv X%Cll intcgrated major road networks - or access to newly developed commercial or residential&#13;
areas. In the solid waste management subsector, less than half of the solid waste is being collected.&#13;
Collcction cquipmcnt falls short of fast growing demand, and acccss roads to waste disposal sites (where&#13;
they exist) arc also inadequate. Many cxisting landfill sites are either running out of capacity, are poorly&#13;
managed or arc improperly sited and may be causing serious pollution of water resources. In the human&#13;
waste/sanitation subsector., household-level, on-site facilities are lacking, equipment for septic sludge&#13;
collection is inadequate, and desludging volume is lcss than 20%  of the volume generated. In the&#13;
drainage/flood control subsector. poor maintenance, insufficient capacity, and inappropriate designs lead&#13;
to frcquCllt floodinig problems in manv lowv lying areas and along river banks.&#13;
3.14    Thlis lack of adequate basic urban infrastructure serviccs hurts the poor the most, because it is&#13;
primarily the poor N%ho are without access to clean and affordable water and waste disposal facilities, and&#13;
who usually hvc in low-ly ing areas that are often affected by flooding. Since urban poverty in Sulawesi is&#13;
substantially higher than the national average in Indonesia, a proportionally higher number of poor are&#13;
affected by thc existing infrastructure and service deficiencies.&#13;
3.15   The increas[ing urban infrastructure and services deficicncies also interfere with the efficient&#13;
performance of the important service and support functions of these towns. They often are administrative&#13;
centers, scrvc as markcts places and transportation hubs, handle scrvice and supply provision. and support&#13;
small industrics and processing facilities. These activities depend heavily on good access and transport.&#13;
rcliable and clcan watcr supplv, sanitary facilities,  safety from  flooding, and availability of land and&#13;
housilg.&#13;
3 16   As a resuilt of the rcccnt economic and population growth. many Sulawesi towns have experienced&#13;
a boom in rcsidential inousing development and an expansion of kampung, slum and squatter areas. The&#13;
lattcr arc miiostly onl marginal lands with little or no services, suffer from pollution. are prone to flooding,&#13;
and they hlOLisc -ostlV low-income families at high densities (up to 500 persons per ha.). Due to lack of&#13;
devclopmcni planning and coordination, the higher cost housing estates often also lack proper access, good&#13;
water supple and sanitation, and flood protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
3.17   Continued neglect of urban infrastructure and services would not only lead to increasing&#13;
degradation of the urban and per'-urban environment, but would also affect public health. These negative&#13;
impacts would in turn constrain the growth of the local economy, especially new investments in the&#13;
tourism, processing and manufacturing sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
4.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND FORMULATION&#13;
4.1    The Project responds to REPELITA VI urban policy initiatives through the continuation and&#13;
expansion of the IUIDP component of the ongoing Sulawesi - Irian Jaya Project.  Critical urban&#13;
infrastructure investments and assistance for municipal management would be provided to some 32&#13;
strategically important, secondary towns selected from the four Sulawesi provinces in addition to the nine&#13;
towns already benefiting from SIJUDP-financed investment. The scope of the subsectors covered has been&#13;
enlarged over the first project. The eight subsectors now covered are: urban planning, housing, water&#13;
supply, sanitation, drainage, urban roads, solid waste management, and urban renewal. Activities are also&#13;
better defined to take advantage of the lessons learned from the previous project, which are: (i) recognition&#13;
of the importance of good O&amp;M is still lacking; (ii) quality control is not yet systematically used during&#13;
implementation; (iii) environmental management and monitoring is slow to take root; (iv) overall urban&#13;
management is still lacking in many towns; and (v) Sulawesi's geography complicates communications and&#13;
travel, and necessitates more responsive forms of implementation support and project supervision. On the&#13;
positive side, however, there is increased awareness of the regional importance of these towns, and there is&#13;
good local leadership and targeted support from the central government.&#13;
4.2    The scale of the project is large. At the request of GOI, particularly in view of past neglect, every&#13;
kabupaten (region) and kotomadya (city) in Sulawesi is included in this project. This comprehensive&#13;
approach is intended to promote greater decentralization through: strengthening horizontal linkages (e.g.&#13;
information sharing between communities); provision of critical infrastructure, such as markets, to&#13;
complement rural development efforts; and strengthening operations of all four provincial governments.&#13;
4.3    The Second Sulawesi Urban Development Project (SULUDP-2) is intended to give continued&#13;
operational reality to the GOI Urban Policy Statement adopted in 1987, underpinning the Urban Sector&#13;
Loan (2616-IND). The SULUDP-2 reflects the six key priority areas of the GOI Urban Policy Statement&#13;
and the related Policy Action Plan, which GOI recently reconfirmcd and extended as the basis for policy&#13;
actions in the current GOI five-year development plan (REPELITA VI). The six policy themes were:&#13;
(a) Decentralization of urban services delivery responsibilities to local governments&#13;
(kabupatens/kotamadyas), as their capacities permit;&#13;
(b) Preparation and implementation of local urban improvement programs with the framework of&#13;
the GOI IUIDP, defined to include physical infrastructure investment and O&amp;M for public&#13;
works sub-sectors and programs;&#13;
(c) Development of local government institutional capacities to manage and sustain urban&#13;
services delivery systems to rapidly growing urban populations;&#13;
(d) Strengthening of local government capacities to mobilize resources and optimize the use of&#13;
funds under their control;&#13;
(e) Improvement in the framework for coordination and consultation among the involved&#13;
agencies through: (i) new/revised mechanisms for local government borrowing; and (ii)&#13;
improved criteria for allocation of grants; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
(f) Rationalizing the procedures for coordination and consultation among the involved&#13;
agencies and levels of government (central, provincial, and local) to improve communication&#13;
and facilitate implementation efforts.&#13;
4.4     The preceding six policy themes are generic for all dccentralization efforts of urban service&#13;
delivery in Indonesia.  These objectives are consistent with activities in Sulawesi, however, further&#13;
refinement has been needed to take into account varying levels of local capacities and infrastructure service.&#13;
The four provinces of Sulawesi themselves each have varying levels of institutional capacities, South&#13;
Sulawesi being considerably more advanced.  Also, within the 41 project towns, capabilities vary&#13;
considerably. This is to be expected as a city like Ujung Pandang or Manado will have far more resources&#13;
and staff capabilities than smaller and more isolated communities. The Project is designed to accommodate&#13;
these disparate levels of capabilities, and develop communities at a pace that reflects local conditions.&#13;
4.5     The initial project request from GOI included 18 towns (see Annex 2). Consultants contracted to&#13;
prepare a financing proposal for infrastructure investments in the 18 towns were based in Palu to ensure&#13;
proximity  and  facilitate interaction  with  local governments.   Subsequently, demanding, increased&#13;
recognition of the role of small to]vn in balanced regional development. GOI requested that the scope of&#13;
the project be expanded, and an additional 23 towns were added to the project. The additional 'Batch 2"&#13;
towns have a more programmatic investment plan. Table 4.1 below shows the number and size of project&#13;
towns.&#13;

4.6     Preparation activities for this project highlight the on-going needs of communities in Sulawesi.&#13;
Efforts to prioritize investment needs, agreement on a viable project scope, and obtaining relevant data and&#13;
information were most effective during the latter stages of preparation when staff from DGCK and the&#13;
consultants entered into iterative discussions with local governmcnt staff. This experience will be built&#13;
upon to enhance institutional development throughout project implementation by engaging local staff in&#13;
frequent dialogue on the full range of urban management activities.&#13;
4.7     Preparation for this project highlighted recent business innovations within the Bank including&#13;
balanced emphasis and close integration between project preparation, implementation, supervision and&#13;
sector work. Sulawesi requires a more comprehensive and coordinated assistance strategy. efforts are well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
underway in this area. Much of the preparation work was completed through SIJUDP. Already six&#13;
separate and focused Bank interventions have been successfully accomplished within the SULUDP-2&#13;
(water resources in Pare Pare, sanitation pilot in Toli Toli, composting project in Ujung Pandang, tourism&#13;
study in Tana Toraja, assistance with solid waste disposal siting and operations, Bitung drainage study,&#13;
and sanitation alternatives; see Annex 3). Experienced non-governmental organizations, familiar with the&#13;
WSSLIC project, were used to assist with preparation of the resettlement action plans, and real demand&#13;
surveys.&#13;
4.8    As part of the project preparation activities real demand surveys were carried out by the Provincial&#13;
Bureaus of Statistics in seven sample towns where the local Planning Boards expressed the wish to gauge&#13;
the perceptions and priorities of the people - a form of urban community consultation using a representative&#13;
sample. These surveys are considered to be not only statistically valid, but they are a very useful tool to&#13;
measure community attitudes. During implementation, they could be expanded to gauge the communities&#13;
position on environmental improvements, satisfaction with quality and level of services, or changing&#13;
priorities. (Annex 4 presents a summary of the real demand surveys carried out in seven Sulawesi towns&#13;
during 1995).&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.9    The main development objective of the proposed project is to improve the delivery of urban&#13;
infrastructure services by local governments on a sustainable basis.   The more specific operational&#13;
objectives of the project include:&#13;
(a)    improve the provision of urban services through appropriate economic investments in&#13;
physical infrastructure (roads, water supply, sanitation, drainage, solid waste management,&#13;
markets, and transport terminals);&#13;
(b)    strengthen operations and maintenance activities for urban services, and support improved&#13;
planning, programming, budgeting, financial management and local revenue generation by&#13;
local governments; and&#13;
(c)    improve urban environmental management and reduce local environmental impacts.&#13;
4.10   In line with existing GOI policies and planning objectives, as well as the Bank's own country&#13;
assistance strategy which emphasizes a more decentralized and participatory approach to service provision,&#13;
the proposed project also has three other aims. These process objectives are to: (i) help improve general&#13;
resettlement practices relating to resettlement of people displaced by infrastructure development; (ii) better&#13;
incorporate public and community participation in local government operations; and (iii) enhance and&#13;
rationalize public-private partnership in the provision of urban services&#13;
4.11   Measuring Progress Towards Project Objectives.  Integrated urban projects, even those&#13;
confined to a single city, are notorious for their complexity and amorphous structure. A certain degree of&#13;
complexity is intrinsic to urban development programs given the variety of basic services involved, each of&#13;
which has several relevant attributes requiring improvement (e.g. coverage, quality, reliability) as well as&#13;
many interrelated activities (e.g. production, treatment and distribution of water, or collection and disposal&#13;
of waste) and varied interactions (e.g. road works affect drainage and flooding; waste contaminates water).&#13;
The proposed project has yet another dimension of multiplicity in that it seeks to improve the provision of&#13;
urban services in 40 local governments with dramatically varying conditions. While measuring the impact&#13;
or even summarizing the intermediate outcomes in a meaningful manner is therefore difficult, it is&#13;
nonetheless imperative to monitor performance objectively and regularly during implementation because the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
same complexity is likely to diffuse and dissipate efforts unless the management svstems are in place to&#13;
vigilantly reorient and focus them sharplv towards achieving the stated objectives.&#13;
4.12   Also, GOI has requested that any efforts to monitor project performancc are consistent with&#13;
National BAPPENAS and Cipta Karya programs. There is a keen device to measure isustainability of&#13;
development" and quality of local 'lnunicipal governance" through this project. Thc indicators were&#13;
largely developed by BAPPENAS and Cipta Karya, with minimal duplication of data gathering and&#13;
maximum integration with existing programs. During implemcntation, the Central Government and the&#13;
project Provinces will monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis the execution of the project and the&#13;
achievement of the objectives using the performance indicators described below, an anniual report on the&#13;
evaluation of progress and achievements will be provided to the Bank.&#13;
4.13   A nested hierarchy of indicators will be used to monitor and evaluate the achievement of this&#13;
operation's objectives. At the most basic level, a sct of phvsical completion (or output) indicators will&#13;
measure the accomplishmnents in terms of physical installation of facilities (e.g. roads widened, water&#13;
supply connections, septic tanks, landfills developed) relative to thc targets embodied in each town's&#13;
medium tcrm  investment programs (PJM).  A simplc aggregation across all the participating local&#13;
government's will be used to track the overall phvsical achievcmcnts of the project, aggregation at the&#13;
provincial level will also be available for monitoring by Level I administration. Annex 5 provides details.&#13;
4.14   While such physical and financial indicators are useful at an aggregate levcl and provide a rough&#13;
indication of efficiency and effectiveness of resource use, they can be misleading as regards to the outcome&#13;
or impact on the ground, especially when the situation varics considerably across towns as in Sulawesi and&#13;
over time. More importantly, arbitrary use of such indicators can provide the wrong signals or incentives&#13;
to local officials and reinforce a top-down approach. Indeed, one of the lessons documented by OED from&#13;
the experience of completed Bank-financed urban projccts is that an excessive focus on physical targets&#13;
was harmful to institutional development and cost recovery. In order to obviate such advcrse outcomes, a&#13;
second group of performance indicators (numbers 2 through 5) has been designed to help transform local&#13;
governments into service-oriented performance-bascd organizations.  Improvcd provision of services&#13;
requires local administrators to set appropriate goals, make requisite plans, takc appropriate actions, and&#13;
evaluate the outcome. The second set of performance indicators will, therefore, support this process of&#13;
learning-by-doing. As an adjunct to basic monitoring systems for project implemcntation, every year&#13;
during the provincial approval of the Annual Projcct Implementation Plan (see para 5.5), each local&#13;
government woould agree (contract) with the provincial authorities on five to seven priority targets which&#13;
best capture the project's desired impact in each community. Thcsc targets mav vary widely according to&#13;
local conditions and perceived priorities; a menu of potential targets is presented in Anne-x 5. The&#13;
achievements of these targets would be rcviewed the following ycar and each local government would be&#13;
rated into one of four categories viz.. Highly Satisfactory (HS), Satisfactory (S), Unsatisfactory (U) and&#13;
Highly Unsatisfactory (HU). As detailed in the appendix, the decision rule to be used implies that a HS&#13;
rating requires that no more than one of the contract targets be missed, while more than two missed targets&#13;
would lead to a 'U" rating or worse. The performance would be monitorcd bv GOI and the Bank on a&#13;
portfolio basis, viz. the proportions of Level 11 local governments falling in each rating category.&#13;
4.15   As regards to objectives (b) and (c), three targets relating respectively to rcvcnue mobilization,&#13;
O&amp;M expenditure and the urban environment would have univcrsal applicability and be monitored&#13;
annually by the implementation support team for each of the participating local govcrnmenits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
4.16   Finally, the three process objectives (para 4.9) are such that at this stage in the evolution of local&#13;
administration in Sulawesi, meaningful targets cannot be defined for general resettlement practices,&#13;
community participation and private provision of public services. Yet they are key components of the&#13;
relevant '"ocial infrastructure" which is necessary to enhance the ultimate value and sustainability of the&#13;
project interventions. Indeed, the project aims at facilitating a long-term attitudinal shift and change in the&#13;
way things are done. However, it is possible instead to monitor progress in these areas and the impact of&#13;
the project, if any, will indeed be tracked using quantitative indicators outlined in Annex 5.&#13;
4.17   Ultimately, the perceptions of civil society, i.e. the residents of the participating towns, regarding&#13;
the extent to which their individual and collective needs for infrastructure and urban services are being met,&#13;
must be the measure of the program's effectiveness. However, the mechanisms for measuring public&#13;
satisfaction or unmet needs are currently crude at best. Subsectoral technical memoranda for water supply,&#13;
sanitation, solid waste, and traffic management, as well as KIP/MIIP programs call for obtaining direct&#13;
public input to subproject design, but contain no provision for feedback on the resulting services. There is&#13;
now some experience (including developing countries) on having report cards on public service agencies&#13;
using surveys. As a piloting effort in Indonesia, options for expanded surveys and other mechanisms for&#13;
obtaining inputs from people at large will be investigated throughout project implementation.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.18   The proposed SULUDP-2 follows on the ongoing SIJUDP which is scheduled to close on&#13;
December 31, 1996. The new project would help to reduce the backlog of urban infrastructure investments&#13;
by providing assistance to a total of 41 Sulawesi towns involving 40 local governments (regencies and&#13;
cities). A complete list of project local governments and towns is provided in Annex 2. This project is&#13;
designed as a programmatic operation and will provide subproject investments in water supply, drainage,&#13;
urban roads, solid waste management, urban planning and kampung (neighborhood) improvement&#13;
programs (KIP), and market and terminal infrastructure and superstructure improvements. These will be&#13;
complemented by LIDAPs to improve management, increase the institutional capacity of the implementing&#13;
agencies, and RIAPs to improvc local financial management and revenue generation of the local&#13;
governments; the detailed Project Implementation Plan is available in the Project File.&#13;
4.19   The proposed project would not only fund infrastructurc investments and their related support&#13;
needs, but would also support a comprchensive implementation support strategy. The implementation&#13;
support strategy is designed to help develop local government staff to 'learn-by-doing", and build&#13;
community partnerships. These strengthened partnerships would focus on improving the role of the private&#13;
sector and maximize the contributions available through consultation and participation of the local&#13;
community. The implementation support team would be a mix of local and international experts,&#13;
community groups, and clerical support (see Annex 6). Modest, but highly focused and followed-through&#13;
interventions will be the key to this strategy. Already a simple landfill siting and operation handbook is&#13;
being prepared. This handbook will serve as an example at project launch, seeking local government input&#13;
on how best to support their operational activities throughout projcct implementation.&#13;
4.20   Infrastructure Works. The works to be carried out under the project include:&#13;
(a)    Urban Planning. This component would finance the preparation of district development&#13;
plans, site plans, district action plans, conservation and environmental plans, site layout&#13;
and design plans, and detailed town plan stucies.&#13;
(b)    Water Supply. This component would finance leakage detection and repair programs as&#13;
highest priorities and engineering studies. It would also provide funding for works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
including investments in transmission and distribution networks, installation of hydrants,&#13;
construction of reservoirs, and the construction of office space and laboratories as well as&#13;
the procurement of laboratory equipment for somc PDAMs. It will also prepare&#13;
institutional training packages for some PDAMs. especially in the areas of water loss&#13;
reduction, O&amp;M and financial management.&#13;
(c)    Human Waste/Sanitation. This component Avill prepare detailed engineering designs.&#13;
Civil works will include construction of septage treatment plants, and communal septic&#13;
tanks and toilets. Funds from the local government for the necessary land acquisition will&#13;
be included. Septagc removal equipment (vacuum trucks) will bc purchased.&#13;
Groundwater testing will be carried out. and instmictional and awareness packages&#13;
prepared.&#13;
(d)    Drainage/Flood Control. This component includes the preparation of plans and detailed&#13;
enginecring studies. Works include the construction and rehabilitation of primary and&#13;
secondary drainagc canals, normalization of river banks, and deferred and incremental&#13;
O&amp;M- Final designs will incorporate flood control systems, retention basins where&#13;
appropriate, and will review usefulness of hydraulic flood control gates in low lying areas.&#13;
Public awareness packages will be prepared and training sessions held to address&#13;
indiscriminate and illegal dumping of solid wastc and to improve O&amp;M.&#13;
(e)    Urban Roads. The project will finance the acquisition of the necessary land (using local&#13;
funds), construct and/or upgrade arteries, roadside drains, collector roads, local roads,&#13;
bridges, culverts. install traffic signals and prepare road signs and markings to improve&#13;
traffic flow. Somc periodic and routine maintenancc will be carried out under the project.&#13;
It will also finance training sessions for public works staff&#13;
(f)    Solid Waste Management. The solid waste management component will provide&#13;
increased collection coverage (aiming to reach 80%, in built-up areas of 200 p/ha density&#13;
or more) and develop new solid waste disposal sites (TPAs) in most towns. Solid waste&#13;
disposal sites will be developed as sanitary landfill sites and controlled dumps, and will be&#13;
developed together, where practical, with sludge disposal plants to handle septic tank&#13;
effluent in a number of locations. Disposal treatment facilities will be installed at each site&#13;
to treat leachate and runoff from the solid waste materials. Procurement of equipment&#13;
such as bulldozers, dump trucks, containers, special transport containers, specialized&#13;
vehicles such as arm roll trucks, compactor trucks and sludge removal trucks, and hand&#13;
carts are included in the programs for each city. Training and awareness campaigns are&#13;
also included. An emphasis on enhanced composting and recycling, better TPA site&#13;
selection and operations, and more community involvement will be maintained through out&#13;
the project.&#13;
(g)    KIP - Kampung Investment. The project will contribute to improving conditions in poor&#13;
slums and kampungs selected by the local BAPPEDA 11 and DPUK on the basis of&#13;
infrastructure deficiencies, high population densities, low incomes, and community interest&#13;
to participate in improvcments. They will be upgraded through the provision of footpaths,&#13;
drainage, sanitation improvement, water supply and acccss, road construction.&#13;
Community participation will be mobilized to achieve better targeted and more sustainable&#13;
development in the kampungs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(h)    Markets and Transport Terminals. This component will fund through subloans to the&#13;
local government. siting and detailed cost recovery studies, where nceded, and&#13;
rehabilitation and new construction of markets and terminal superstructures wvith shops,&#13;
stalls and ancillary facilities for water supply, wastc management, parking and access.&#13;
(i)    Detailed Design. As defined above thc project provides engincering scrvices by local&#13;
consultants for final engineering design and supervision of more complex subprojects. The&#13;
simple subprojects will be designed and supervised in-house by the responsible local&#13;
government departments or PDAM; thcy xvill help with final dcsign of works and&#13;
supervision of the construction undertaken by contractors as requircd.&#13;
(j)    Resettlement. Rcscttlement and rehabilitation of people affected by the projcct, including&#13;
the provision of infrastructure and services in the resettlement areas.&#13;
Anne-x 7 presents representative investments in four different towvns.&#13;
Local Government Development&#13;
4.21   The proposed project recognizes that improvements to the delivery, of urban infrastructure services&#13;
will receive a commcnsurate strengthening of local governments. While this is a long-term process, it is&#13;
possible to use project investments and implementation support to bring about local government&#13;
development.   To maximize local government development, the proposed projcct has a major&#13;
implementation support component.  The implementation support strategy, see Annex 6, varies from&#13;
traditional projects since it has much more 'hands-on" assistance. Each of the four provinces would have&#13;
an implementation support team located in the field and made up of two to three experienced practitioners&#13;
(four to six in South Sulawesi due to the much larger number of towns). The four teams would be based in&#13;
the provincial capitals and would spend at lcast 70% of their timc in the field witlh counterpart staff in the&#13;
41 local governmcnts.&#13;
4.22   Each provincial implementation support team  will have experienced municipal engineering,&#13;
planning and budgeting/finance practitioners.  These specialists would also incorporate into local&#13;
government urban management and operations the use of LIDAP, RIAP, PFAMs and Performance-&#13;
Oriented Maintenance Management System; they will attempt to make these programs more relevant and&#13;
understandable to local government staff. See Annex 8&#13;
4.23   Through the implementation support component, the proposed project is also designed to&#13;
strengthen local government partnerships. The two main 'partnerships"targeted are with the private sector&#13;
and the with the general public.&#13;
4.24   Throughout thc project, efforts will be made to actively and professionally involve the private&#13;
sector where appropriate. This would be accomplishcd through improved local government contracting&#13;
(including operations contracts) and professional experienced assistance in each provincial support team.&#13;
The contracted expert in the implementation support team would help to: identify opportunities, assess&#13;
private sector capacities, prepare and award contracts, supervisc and adjust contracts. This follow-up&#13;
approach should yield more positive results than previous efforts. The communities of Sulawesi have&#13;
significant scope for private sector involvement, however this involvement will be modest. reflecting local&#13;
conditions. This scale of private sector involvement should first be viewed in terms of a few small-scale&#13;
contracts, e.g. removal of market waste. In time the scale may grow, but initially, activities will focus on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
appropriate, locally specific partnerships. Private sector activities will also be monitored in the annual&#13;
reviews (see Annex 9).&#13;
4.25    The local government partnership with the general community will also bc strengthened.  The&#13;
project supports community-sensitive resettlement policies that are more in keeping with national and&#13;
international standards. Improvements to resettlement practices would not be limited to Bank financed&#13;
activities  only.   Similarly  the  project, through  community  survcys  and  education  activities, will further&#13;
enhance the role of the public, particularly women, in the day-to-day provision of urban infrastructure&#13;
services, e.g. solid waste. KIP and MIIP projects will involve the public in planning and implementation;&#13;
real demand surveys will also be used as a tool to better reflect the public in the municipal decision making&#13;
process. Environmental education activities would most likely focus on women, school aged children, and&#13;
business.&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
4.26    Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 4.2 below. with further details given in Annex 10.&#13;
The total project cost for the five year period 1996/97 to 2000/01 is estimated at Rp.614.6 billion,&#13;
equivalent to US$272.0 million. Base costs, in October 1995 prices, total Rp.518.3 billion (US$229.4&#13;
million), the balance of the project cost representing contingencics.  Physical contingencies average 8.7&#13;
percent of investment base costs. Price contingencies reflect current Bank estimates of domestic and&#13;
foreign inflation at 6.0 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.&#13;

E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.28    The Project financing plan is summarized in Table 4.3 below, with further details given in Annex&#13;
10. The proposed Bank Loan of US$155 million equivalent will provide 45.4 percent of the total estimated&#13;
program financing requirement of US$341.2 million. GOI agencies will finance an estimated US$186.2&#13;
million, made up of US$102.6 million from local government normal revenue sources (locally derived&#13;
revenues and normal grant entitlements), US$24.6 million from  water enterprise internal funds, US$17.2&#13;
million from the provincial governments, and US$41.8 million from the central government domestic&#13;
budget. In terms of the project cost only, Bank financing will actually represent 57.0 percent of total&#13;
project cost.&#13;

4.29    Onlending. An estimated US$29.3 million (19 percent) of the total Bank Loan will be onlent by&#13;
the central government to local governments and water enterprises under subsidiary loan agreements&#13;
(SLA). The sub-loans will carry a fixed interest rate of 11.75 percent (the current local rate fixed by MOF&#13;
for all borrowings by local governments and their enterprises); and a commitment fee nominally of 0.75&#13;
percent, which will be reduced to the same concessionary level as applies from time to time to the Bank&#13;
Loan (currently 0.25 percent). The loan periods will be consistent with the average economic life of the&#13;
investments being financed, subject to a maximum of 20 years. Grace periods will be allowed equal to the&#13;
procurement/commissioning periods for the investments, to a maximum of five years. Local governments&#13;
will in all cases be required to pay interest during the grace periods. The foreign exchange and interest rate&#13;
variation risks will be borne by GOI. For water enterprises, deferment of payment of interest during the&#13;
grace period will be allowed in cases where the financial capacity analysis shows that an enterprise cannot&#13;
afford such interest payment; deferred interest will be compounded and added to the loan principal. MOF&#13;
has established a minimum sub-loan size of Rp.250 million. The total amount onlent may be adjusted&#13;
during project implementation based on need and financial capabilities of the local entities. Agreement on&#13;
revised standard SLA documents for local governments and participating water enterprises respectively&#13;
was reached at Loan negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
4.30   Central Government Budgetary Contributions.  Thc central government will budget an&#13;
estimated Rp.195.0 billion (US$84.8 million) for Project investment; an estimated Rp.109.1 billion&#13;
(US$47.4 million) of this amount will be financed by the Bank. It will further budget an estimated total&#13;
Rp.158.0 billion (US$68.6 million) as non-repayable (grant) contributions for the finance of Project&#13;
responsibilities of lower level government institutions. This amount can be divided into two elements. The&#13;
first element, estimated at Rp.96.9 billion (US$42.1 million) represents investments, engineering design and&#13;
technical assistance contracts planned to be implemented by the local government agencies. The second&#13;
element, estimated at Rp.61.0 billion (US$26.5 million) represents investments, engineering design and&#13;
technical assistance contracts planned by the provincial governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
5.1    The proposed project will be implemented over a period of five years, commencing GOI&#13;
FY1996/1997, and ending in FY2000/2001. The program of works has been designed to commence&#13;
implementation immediately after the loan becomes effective. Design requirements for the first year&#13;
components are limited (the selected components are small and simple) and designs are being completed in&#13;
time for tendering and implementation later during the fiscal year: most of the designs for the second year&#13;
will be completed by the current preparation consultants before the cnd of 1996.&#13;
5.2    Standard tender and contract documents for the various types of packages will be used. For the&#13;
sake of consistency, the standard procurement documents prepared for the Second l.ast Java (Jrban&#13;
Development Project have been adapted for this project and were agreed during Loan negotiations so&#13;
that they can be approved, and their implementation can commence in the next GOI fiscal year.&#13;
5.3    Since design and supervision services will be needed soon after the loan is approved, appropriate&#13;
arrangements for their selection and mobilization have been made. Draft terms of reference for the high&#13;
priority design and supervision services have already been prepared, and shortlisting and proposal&#13;
invitation for these services will be commenced immediately following negotiations. Submission to the&#13;
Bank offinalized terms of reference and consultants shortlist, acceptable to the Bank, for the agreed&#13;
priority implementation support was a condition of Board presentation. Detailed engineering design&#13;
(DED) and supervision will be organized and managed on a provincial basis and coordinated by the&#13;
provincial-level implementation support team. DED and supervision will be provided on an as-needed&#13;
basis to participating local governments; it is expected that only more complex designs, studies and&#13;
supervision assignments will be carried out by consultants, and that basic engineering work will be done in-&#13;
house by the local governments and PDAM as is the current practice. The implementation schedule and&#13;
annual program cycle are graphically summarized in Annex 11.&#13;
B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLANS&#13;
5.4    Provincial Program Implementation Memorandum (PPIM). The four Sulawesi Provinces have&#13;
been designated by GOI as the principal implementing agencies for the implementation of the proposed&#13;
project. For central GO] operational and technical coordination and oversight the DGCK will be the&#13;
executing agency, while the TKPP chaired by BAPPENAS is providing policy guidance and sectoral&#13;
oversight. As such local leadership arrangements have not been previously attempted, except in the&#13;
metropolitan cities and currently being also proposed for East Java Province, all parties involved have&#13;
agreed to prepare a 'Provincial Program Implementation Memorandum (PPIM)" which will document the&#13;
respective roles, responsibilities and procedures for project implementation, in the form of a memorandum&#13;
of understanding to be signed by the Chairperson of TKPP, the Director General of Cipta Karya and the&#13;
Governor of the respective province in Sulawesi. Annex 12A displays a draft outline for the PPIM&#13;
memorandum. Agreement on draft of the PPIM was reached during negotiations. Signature of the final&#13;
PPIM is a condition of Loan effectiveness.&#13;
5.5    Annual Program Implementation Plan (APIP). APIPs will be drawn up between the respective&#13;
Province, the local governments participating in the project and their PDAMs to confirm the essential&#13;
understandings and commitments based upon the medium-term expenditure programs (PJMs), financing&#13;
plans, RIAPs, LIDAPs, performance indicators, and sound criteria for land acquisition and resettlement.&#13;
These will be expressed as priority targets and performance indicators for each implementing unit (See&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
Annex 5). Through the APIPs, the local governments and their PDAMs would commit thcmiisclvcs to&#13;
comprehensive sectoral investment programs (including O&amp;M budgets), specific revenue targets. and&#13;
measures to strengthen the institutional capabilities for urban management. The investment and sector&#13;
plans will be amended/updated annually, and a draft presented during the Annual Impleimccntation Review&#13;
meetings arranged with the main Bank supervision mission, to reflect changing conditionis during projcct&#13;
implementation - the annual review will also reward good performance with additional investmclts, and&#13;
will cut back finding wvhere achievement of targets is lowv. All ma jor amendmcnt proposals should include&#13;
an environmental assessment, a managcment and monitoring plan and. if nccessarv. a rcsettlmcncilt plan An&#13;
outline of the APIP is presented in Annex 12B. T'he model All'l. to be executiedl hctuen the respective&#13;
provincial governments and partlicipating local governments ancd PDAMs was reviwved and aigreel at&#13;
negotiations.  The first executed API' document, capproved hbi the Bank, arc Lutd/i/lwn  of Loan&#13;
disbuirsement for goods and works under subprojects for each participating local goverrnent aind&#13;
PDAM.&#13;
5.6    Subproject Approval. The subproject definition, budgeting and supervision arrangements for the&#13;
implementation of the Project will be summarized for provincial review and approval in a set of annual&#13;
'Project Memoranda" prepared by each participating local government and PDAiM ancl approvcd by the&#13;
PPMU. These Project Memoranda will provide detailed budget proposals for cvcr subprojcct, covering&#13;
all concerned institutions at every government level (including the w\ater enterprises). sho\ing cach contract&#13;
package, necessary O&amp;M  provisions, etc., with the proposed financing sourccs.  'I'lh  draft Projcct&#13;
Memoranda will form the inputs into the annual budget preparation cyclc wvhich commncrics \%1th the local&#13;
and provincial level consultation meetings known as 'RAKORBANG"' through which  thc nccessary&#13;
funding allocations will be secured. Each subproject memorandum will require the certiticationi of the&#13;
provincial government that it conforms with the relevant local government appraised progr-atml (PIM).&#13;
Newly identified subprojects for financing under the programmatic provisions of the loan or chanigcs in&#13;
subproject proposals must be notified to the provincial government which will coonduct a program&#13;
reappraisal and report approved changes to the Bank. Supporting documcntation, including cnvironmcntal&#13;
impact screening results and resettlement action plan (RAP) documents, where nceded, must bc attachcd to&#13;
each subproject memorandum and the RAP submitted to the Bank for approval. D)ctailcd and costed&#13;
investments proposals are available in each community's five year PJM  (see Prolcct Filc).  Many&#13;
investments are still of a programmatic approach, and investments will be agrced to and jtustified&#13;
throughout project implementation according to the following agreed main Projcct critcria: (i) tcclhnical&#13;
standards, guidelines and criteria; (ii) minimum EIRR of 12% for any water supply drainage and flood&#13;
control subproject estimated to cost Rp.2 billion or more; (iii) resettlement action plan for anx subprocct&#13;
involving the involuntary resettlement of people; and (iv) complction of environmelntal management and&#13;
monitoring requirements.&#13;
C. LOCAL IMPLEMENT1NG AGENCIES&#13;
5.7    The existing agencies at the municipal level will be responsible for implementingl the projcct and&#13;
can be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a) Operations and Maintenance. A technical team wvill be establishcd to provide teclnical&#13;
support (planning, programming, budgeting, controlling, evaluating and rcporting) at the&#13;
municipal level to strengthen the O&amp;M program for roads, water supply, drainage and solid&#13;
waste. The project will provide support to identify the necds for better O&amp;M performance,&#13;
additional O&amp;M staff, additional equipment and training;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
(b) Urban Roads and Traffic Management. The Roads and Bridges section of DPUK is&#13;
responsible for the construction, maintenance and supervision of local roads, roadside drains&#13;
and bridges.  Provincial and national roads are the responsibility of the provincial and&#13;
national governments respectively. Consulting support is being provided under the project to&#13;
design in detail, evaluate and implement individual road rehabilitation, improvement or new&#13;
construction schemes.&#13;
(c) Water Supply. The PDAMs will be responsible for construction, operation and maintenance&#13;
of the water supply assets generated by the project. Special attention will be given to control&#13;
of UFW. PDAMs are being required to reduce leakage, eliminate illegal connections and&#13;
maximize utilization of their current system, before proposing to increasc treatment capacity&#13;
further. In-fill house connections on existing distribution mains will be given priority over&#13;
new distribution system extensions. Consultant support for implementation of PDAM plans&#13;
and physical improvements is provided in the project design;&#13;
(d) Drainage and Flood Control. At the municipal level, the drainage sub-section of each&#13;
DPUK has specific rcsponsibility for storm drainagc and flood control within the municipal&#13;
area. Designated major watenvays are the rcsponsibility of provincial or central Pengairan&#13;
offices, but all local drainage works must be executed by DPUK. O&amp;M performance will be&#13;
strengthened through the implementation support;&#13;
(e) Human Waste Disposal. The on-site sanitation program in all cities will be implemented by&#13;
the local government with the community using municipal staff (BANGDES) as project&#13;
mangers.  Sludge collection and disposal services will be provided by the Cleansing&#13;
Department (Dinas Kebersihan - see below) in each local government, but efforts wvill be&#13;
made as much as possible to contract out these services to private operators under the&#13;
supervision of the municipal agency;&#13;
(f) Solid Waste Management. Dinas Kebersihan (Cleansing Agency) or DPUK in all the&#13;
municipalities will bc responsible for all solid waste management activities;&#13;
(g) KIP. DPUK in each local governrnent also will be responsible for implementing KIP.&#13;
Consultant services, where needed, providing technical assistance on the financial, economic,&#13;
institutional and environmental aspects, will be located in the Dinas; and&#13;
(h) MIIP. Where it exists, the market agency in each local government (Dinas Pengelola Pasar)&#13;
will be responsible for implementing the MIIP component of the project. In all other cases,&#13;
implementation will fall directly on the local DPUK.&#13;
D. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MONITORING&#13;
5.8    Provincial Government Responsibilities. Each provincial government will play a key role in the&#13;
overall management, coordination and monitoring of the project, including the management of the&#13;
implementation support team. Based on experience from the ongoing SIJUDP, the local (Tkll) level is&#13;
rather isolated and disconnected from the provincial and central levels for monitoring and support. Under&#13;
the proposed project, this problem will be remedied by establishing a single functional organization, the&#13;
Provincial Project Management Unit (PPMU), in each of the Provincial Offices of Public Works (DPUP I)&#13;
for the overall management of the project, including support, coordination, monitoring and reporting. A&#13;
key responsibility of the PPMU will be to issue guidelines for the preparation of APIPs, ensure that they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
are prepared on time, and review the APIPs in coordination with BAPPEDA Tk I and the Kanwil PU.&#13;
PPMU will also develop and issue standard operating procedures for program implementation. The&#13;
updated functions and organization of the PPMU will be confirmcd by a decree of the provincial Governor&#13;
as a condition of disbursement. The PPMU will have strong leadcrship, through a full-time Unit manager&#13;
(Kepala PPMU) and an adequate budget. The implementation support team will be attached to the PPMU.&#13;
Annex 13 shows the proposed organization structure of the PPMU within the provincial government and&#13;
how it relates to the contract and to the local governments. Receipt of docuimentary evidence satisfacltory&#13;
to the Bank confirming the establishment of the PPMAU is a condition of Loan disbursement for goods&#13;
and works in each province.&#13;
5.9    Technical coordination will be carried out by thc provincial Dinas in their respective areas of&#13;
responsibility and project implementation units for the execution of subprojects (projcct implementation&#13;
units will be set up as needed); however, the Kanwil PU will coordinate centrally fuinded sectoral programs.&#13;
The Secretary to Governor (Sekwilda 1) will be responsible for overall coordination of implementation.&#13;
The PPMU will work closely with BAPPEDA Tk I. Dinas PU Cipta Karva, Bina Marga, the Sekwilda 1,&#13;
and the Kanwil PU. and these technical agencies will designate staff to function as a Technical&#13;
Coordination Team as shown in Annex 13.&#13;
5.10   Local Government Responsibilities. Local governments participating in the project will have&#13;
primary responsibility for project implementation and monitoring of all project-related activities in their&#13;
jurisdiction. A Local Coordination Team (Tim Koordinasi Tk 11) will be formalized and continued from&#13;
the preparation phase in each local government, with the Bupati/Walikota as the chair and the heads of all&#13;
departments involved as members. Programming and planning functions will be under the overall charge of&#13;
the local planning agency (BAPPEDA 11), in the section for physical infrastructure (Bidang Prasarana&#13;
Fisik). Local project management and coordination will be under the Program Managcment Unit (PMU)&#13;
which will be established in the Dinas PU. A project coordinator will be assigned for day-to-day activities,&#13;
and will be provided with an adequate budget; the project coordinator will be named in the APIP document.&#13;
Line agencies (both local and deconcentrated units of central agencies, as appropriate) will be responsible&#13;
for implementing their designated subproject components through project implementation units. Consistent&#13;
with Indonesian government practice, each implementing agency will appoint subproject managers with an&#13;
appropriate supervision budget.&#13;
5.11   The Secretary to the Bupati/Walikota (Sekwilda II) will have overall responsibility for&#13;
coordinating and reporting on all project-related activities (whether handled bv the local government&#13;
agencies or by the deconcentrated provincial or central agencies). The project coordinator, will compile&#13;
and distribute periodic consolidated progress reports, covering all sectors, with information on both&#13;
physical and financial progress, based on data provided by the subproject managers. The Finance Section&#13;
of the Secretary's Department will maintain up-to-date accounting information on the project using the&#13;
Project Accounting and Monitoring System (PFAMS) where available, alternatively, arrangements will be&#13;
made under the project to install the necessary project accounting systems. Issuance of a local government&#13;
instruction letter (SK Walikota/Bupati) clearly establishing the above roles and functions in the&#13;
appropriate local units will be incluided in the APIP actions for each local government.&#13;
5.12   Central Government Responsibilities. DGCK in MPW. as the central executing agency, will be&#13;
responsible for the overall technical supervision and management of the project. DGCK will delegate&#13;
responsibility for the day-to-day management and monitoring of this project to the respective Sulawesi&#13;
Provinces through the establishment of the agreed standard operating procedures, the Kanwil PU, which is&#13;
the regional office of the central MPW in the province, will work closely with the provincial agencies on&#13;
behalf of DGCK. However, in view of the limited IUDP implementation experience in Sulawesi and based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
on the need for capacity building, a small Central Support Team would be established under DGCK,&#13;
Directorate for Implementation (East), to be set up in a strategic location in Sulawesi, and will provide&#13;
overall coordination, liaison, consistency and quality assurance, as well as support for special initiatives&#13;
and programs, in particular for environmental management, community participation, and private sector&#13;
involvement. The TKPP, which has been established for coordinating and monitoring all IUIDP/IUDP&#13;
projects, will be responsible for overall policy coordination and guidance.&#13;
5.13   The Directorate General for Budget in the Ministry of Finance will be responsible for managing the&#13;
project's special account. Lead responsibility for the Subsidiary Loan Agreements (SLAs) will be assumed&#13;
by the Directorate General for Financial Institutions in the Ministry of Finance. At Loan negotiations,&#13;
revised standard SLAs documents for local governments, and participating water enterprises&#13;
respectively, were agreed between GOI and the Bank. Signed SlIA documents for all disbursements and&#13;
for each participating local government and/or PDAM, the first SLA approved by the Bank are a&#13;
condition of Loan disbuirsement for goods and works in that local jurisdiction.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
5.14   Procurement of works and goods will follow the 'Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits"dated January 1995 and revised in January 1996. Goods contracts costing US$200,000&#13;
or more would be procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, using the&#13;
Bank's standard bidding documents. All consultant services under the Bank loan would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the 'Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency" dated August 1981 by the responsible agency for each contract. Domestic&#13;
preference may be provided during bid evaluation at a rate of 15% of the CIF pricc or the applicable&#13;
customs duty, whichever is lower, for local goods manufacturers participating in the ICB procurement of&#13;
goods. A general procurement notice was issued following negotiations to notify any eligible and interested&#13;
agencies, businesses and individuals.  However, with the exception of some contract packages of&#13;
specialized vehicles and equipment for waste management, essentially all procurement anticipated for&#13;
project implementation will be relatively small civil works contracts under National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) procedures agreed between GOI and the Bank. Civil works contracts, all of which are valued at&#13;
less than US$3 million up to an aggregate amount of US$183.3 million, and goods contracts valued at less&#13;
than US$200,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$11.6 million would be procured by the designated&#13;
subproject implementing agency under national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Goods contracts for less than US$50,000 each up to an aggregate total of US$3.0 million in each&#13;
category, may be procured through national shopping (with at least three quotations). Small works&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$9.6 million may be procured under lump sum fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of three&#13;
qualified local bids (national shopping). Use of the Bank's 1995 Procurement Guidelines (revised on&#13;
January 1996) was confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
5.15   Procurement Review. Civil works contracts of US$1 million equivalent or more in value, goods&#13;
contracts of US$200,000 equivalent or more in value, and consultant services with an estimated value of&#13;
US$ 100,000 or more for engagement of firms and $50,000 or more for the hiring of individual consultants,&#13;
would be subject to prior review by the Bank. The Bank's standard Form of Contract for Consultants'&#13;
Services, dated June 1995 will be used. The first contract for civil works and goods for each implementing&#13;
agency would be subject to prior review by the Bank, to assure use of standard procedures and contract&#13;
formats (see also para 5.19). The balance of contracts for goods and civil works, including those&#13;
reimbursed under statements of expenditure (SOE), would be subject to selective post-review by the Bank.&#13;
Contractors for civil works exceeding US$1 million in value would be pre-qualified in accordance with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Indonesian national procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Terms of reference as well as single-source&#13;
selections for all consulting services, including detailed engineering design and supervision, studies and&#13;
other technical assistance, regardless of the value of the contract would also be subject to prior Bank&#13;
review. Prior review by the Bank is expected to cover approximately 30% of the total value of contracts&#13;
financed by the project. This relatively low review coverage will be compensated for by: (a) use of&#13;
standardized bidding documents; (b) prior review of each different type of contract (road works, drainage)&#13;
since there are numerous contracts of similar nature; and (c) systcmatic post-review by Bank staff during&#13;
supervision.&#13;
5.16   Procurement Design. Where technically feasible and administratively practical, sub-projects will&#13;
be combined to form larger tenders. Procurement of physical components will be kept separate for each&#13;
agency (central and local govermments, PDAMs) to avoid administrative delays and complex payment&#13;
procedures. Similarly, procurement has been kept separate for each sector (roads, drainage, etc.) as each&#13;
contract would be administered by a different agency. Consulting services will be combined wherever&#13;
feasible (e.g. design and supervision, support services, studies, ctc.). Table 5.1 below summarizes the&#13;
procurement arrangements.&#13;

5.18  In order to facilitate disbursements, GOI would establish a Special Account with an initial&#13;
allocation of US$10.0 million in Bank Indonesia. This account should be maintained by the Director&#13;
General of Budget in the Ministry of Finance. The Special Account would be used for all eligible foreign&#13;
and local expenditures. Replenishment of the Special Account will be made on a monthly basis, or when&#13;
20 percent of the Special Account balance has been used, whichever comes first. Assurances were&#13;
obtained during negotiations that the Director General for Bud,get will authorize all disbursements to&#13;
contractors from the Special Account to be made through the KPKN Treasury offices at the sub-&#13;
provincial level (with the exception of any centrally managed technical assistance contracts).&#13;
5.19   Disbursements from  the Loan for the following contracts would be made against full&#13;
documentation: (a) civil works contracts valued at more than US$1 million; (b) goods contracts valued at&#13;
or more than US$200,000; and (c) consultant services contracts with individual consultants valued at more&#13;
than US$50,000 and consulting firm  contracts valued at or more than US$100,000.  All other&#13;
disbursements, including first contracts for goods and works by implementing agencies, would be made&#13;
against SOE for which relevant documents would be retained by the MOF Directorate General for Budget&#13;
Administration and the implementing agencies and made available to the Bank for review upon request. To&#13;
facilitate project implementation SOE procedures will be used, regardless of prior review limits.&#13;
5.20   The proposed disbursement period of five years is somewhat less than the disbursement profile of&#13;
IUIDP projects in Indonesia. However, as this project has been prepared taking into account the start-up&#13;
problems encountered in earlier projects, and because of the steps taken to provide strong implementation&#13;
support to expedite project execution, it is considered achievable. The project completion date is June 30,&#13;
2001, and the loan closing date is December 31, 2001. The estimated schedule of quarterly disbursements&#13;
is shown in Annex 14.&#13;
F. PROJECT ACCOUNT AND AUDITS&#13;
5.21   Prime responsibility for the maintenance of consolidated accounts of expenditures and financing&#13;
sources for all project components at every government level and concerned institution (including the water&#13;
enterprises) will be delegated to the provincial and local governments, which will employ, for this purpose,&#13;
to the extent available, an improved version of the Program Financial Accounting and Monitoring System&#13;
(PFAMS) originally developed under the East Java-Bali Urban Development Project. For each local&#13;
government program (including that of its water enterprise) the Project accounting will be the responsibility&#13;
of the structural finance agency within the local government secretariat (Dinas Bagian Keuangan).&#13;
Responsibility for maintaining the consolidated project accounts and the production of consolidated&#13;
financial reports will be undertaken by the structural finance bureau within the provincial government&#13;
secretariat.&#13;
5.22   Assurances were obtained from GOI at negotiations that the consolidated project accounts,&#13;
including the Special Account and SOE, as well as the overall accounts of the participating PDAMs, will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
be audited annually by independent auditors in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and that the audited&#13;
accounts would be submitted to the Bank no later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year,&#13;
commencing GOI FY9619 7.&#13;
G. PROJECT REPORTING, MONITORING AND BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
5.23   Quarterly progress reports will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by PPMU with assistance&#13;
from DGCK on the basis of inputs from the various central, provincial, kabupaten, and kotamadya&#13;
implementing agencies. The reports will focus on the targets and performance indicators established in the&#13;
PPIP and APIP for each local government (see Annecx 5) and will include an overall program summary,&#13;
covering progress on:&#13;
(a) physical progress of each component;&#13;
(b) institutional development (LIDAP) and revenue improvement (RIAP) action plans.&#13;
(c) consulting services;&#13;
(d) compliance with loan covenants;&#13;
(e) administration and finance, including project costs commitment and disbursement schedule;&#13;
and&#13;
(f) a list of actions to be taken by the various parties.&#13;
The progress report's substance, including indicators and the format will be discussed at the workshop for&#13;
the project launch, scheduled for October/November 1996.&#13;
5.24   Quarterly progress reports will be submitted within 30 days from the end of each quarter, starting&#13;
with the quarter ending in December 1996. On completion of the proposed project, the DGCK together&#13;
with PPMU and the participating kabupatens and kotamadyas will prepare an Implementation Completion&#13;
Report within six months after the loan closing date for review by GOI and the Bank.&#13;
5.25   Annual technical audits will also be carried out over the course of project implementation.&#13;
Assurances were obtained from GOI during negotiations that the Provincial Inspectorate General (It.&#13;
Wil Prop) will carry out annual technical audits during project implementation. Limited technical&#13;
assistance as needed will be provided through the Provincial Implementation Support Teams to enhance the&#13;
capabilities of the Provincial Inspectorate General under the project.&#13;
5.26   The project will require approximately 29 staff weeks of Bank supervision for FY97, 25 for FY98,&#13;
14 for FY99, 15 for FY00, 17 for FY01, and 9 for FY02. Supervision missions will include engineering,&#13;
institutional, financial, environmental and resettlement expertise. Typically, two Bank supervision missions&#13;
per year are planned, one from headquarters to conduct the annual review (October) and spot-check local&#13;
implementation progress and capacity development, and the second to check GOI fiscal year program&#13;
status (March/April) and general implementation performance in the field. These proposed arrangements&#13;
and schedules for project launch work-shops (November 1996), as well as for project supervision&#13;
(March/April annually) and annual review (by October 31) were confirmed with GOI at negotiations (see&#13;
Annex 15).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
H. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
5.27   Expenditure programs for the municipalities and PDAMs include O&amp;M budgets in every subsector&#13;
in accordance with IUIDP guidelines. Current O&amp;M expenditures and incremental O&amp;M expenditures (to&#13;
reach necessary levels and expand coverage) are clearly separated. Adequate budgeting for current and&#13;
incremental O&amp;M is an important objective of this project; domestic budget sourccs will fully fund O&amp;M&#13;
to ensure sustainability of the increased level under the project  Through the implementation support&#13;
component, advice and training would be providcd under the project to continue improvements in&#13;
maintenance practices. During negotiations agreement was reached that GOI will monitor the level and&#13;
quality O&amp;M expenditures of the local governments and participating PDAMs for each year as well as&#13;
the proposed O&amp;M budget for the following year and discuss with the Bank as a component of the&#13;
annual review.&#13;
1. LAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND COMPENSATION&#13;
5.28   Over the last year, the province of East Java has attempted to resolve the differences and gaps&#13;
between KEPRES 55/1993 and Bank Operational Dircctive 4.30. both dealing with land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement practices, and to develop a model provincial policy framework to provide operational guidance&#13;
to local governments on land acquisition, resettlement and compensation needed for projcct implementation.&#13;
The four Sulawesi provinces have reviewed the East Java model and, on its basis, have prepared draft&#13;
Governor's Decrees issuing Resettlement Guidelines and implementation instructions, and sample local&#13;
government (kotamadya/kabupaten) decrees for preparation of subproject RAPs in accordance with the&#13;
Guidelines have been agreed in principle with the provincial governments.  Model drafts of these&#13;
documents were reviewed during negotiations. Finalization of the Governor's Decrees on resettlement&#13;
including implementation guidelines and model Bupati/ Walikotamadya Decrees on resettlement, taking&#13;
into account the agreements reached at negotiations, and submission to the Bank of the signed Decrees&#13;
was a condition of Board presentation.&#13;
5.29   The preparation process for the proposed project has included efforts both to avoid or minimize&#13;
land acquisition, and especially resettlement, needed for the subprojects, and only one resettlement scheme&#13;
requiring a full RAP for about 220 affected families is being proposed for implementation; the RAP for&#13;
Luwuk has been completed and was subsequently reviewed and is still subject to final Bank review for&#13;
compliance with the agreed resettlement framework. The RAP has proposed a resettlement area about 7&#13;
km northeast of town; infrastructure and services w,ill be provided in addition to replacement plots and&#13;
housing. Special emphasis will be given by the local government to mitigating the economic and social&#13;
impacts of this resettlement.&#13;
J. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
5.30   Impacts. The proposed project has been classified as environmental category "B" under the&#13;
Bank's procedures, as the negative impacts are expected to be minor. The project will likely produce an&#13;
overall net positive environmental impact. The water supply component will improve the availability of&#13;
clean drinking water. Under the solid waste management subcomponent, solid waste dumping and&#13;
accumulation will be reduced and sites will be developed as sanitary landfill sites; treatment facilities will&#13;
minimize leachate and runoff as needed. The sanitation component will improve the urban environment&#13;
with improved wastewater and sludge treatment facilities resulting in reduced health risks from&#13;
contaminated water. Improvements of drainage canals will help reduce the frequent flooding, and lessen&#13;
the potential for ponding of polluted water where malaria and dengue-carrying mosquitoes might breed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5.31   Environmental Procedures. Using the new GOI regulations for environmental assessment&#13;
(AMDAL) promulgated in 1993 and 1994, a Regional Environmenital Assessment was carried out during&#13;
preparation of the proposed project (see Annex 16 for a summarv). Regional environmental assessment&#13;
completed for the first 18 project towns clearly found that the most intractable environmental issues are&#13;
common and widc-spread within all communities. Follow-up investigations for the second batch of 24&#13;
towns reinforced thesc initial findings. Therefore the proposed projcct has a two tiered approach to&#13;
environmental issues.&#13;
5.32   The first tier of interventions is to followv and strengthen the existing GOI environmental legislation&#13;
and safeguards. The GOI has in place "umbrella" environmental legislation goveming the environmental&#13;
assessment process (AMDAL). Within this framework. Indonesia has two complementary environmental&#13;
tools: UKL (environmental managemcnt plans) and UPL (environmental monitoring plans).&#13;
5.33   UKL/UPL Preparation and Review. UKL/UPL for subprojects are to be prepared and reviewed&#13;
as part of subproject approval (Project Memoranda). with particular attention paid to whether the&#13;
management and monitoring measures are included in subproject design and tender documents. During&#13;
project implementation, UKL/UPL review will be the responsibility of technical agencics in the provincial&#13;
government, coordinated by the implementation support teams. The review should include screening of any&#13;
proposed project sites not already screened when the PJMs wcre originally preparcd. especially for final&#13;
TPAs to ensure that they are located in suitable areas. Approval of the UKL/UPL by the support teams&#13;
and concerned provincial agencies, would be a prerequisitc for subproject approval.&#13;
5.34   The regional EA, which has been cited as a best-practice example, clearly highlights that adherence&#13;
to GOI environmental legislation will not be enough to achieve the desired improvements to local&#13;
environments. This "second tier" of environmental intervention is mostly a question of changing people's&#13;
attitudes - those of the decision makers as much as those of the public - through increascd awareness and&#13;
better understanding of the health and economic benefits of a cleaner urban environment for all income&#13;
groups. Many environmental problems are generic across Sulawcsi; they will not be remedied through&#13;
legislation. Rather, changes to attitudes, and more importantly, relatively minor, but ongoing and&#13;
consistent changes to 'day-to-day' municipal activities need to be cncouraged as well as a broader, more&#13;
cooperative approach, e.g. protection of a shared watershed. The regional environmental assessment lays&#13;
out a strategy to accomplish this, and will be a main focus of supcrvision activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. FINANCIAL ASPECTS (LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PDAM)&#13;
6.1    Local Government Financial Analysis and Cost Recovery.  The financial situation of local&#13;
governments has been examined and action plans for revenue improvement by local governments have been&#13;
prepared during the project preparation. The share of locally generated revenue which is under the direct&#13;
control of the local governments is rather small, ranging from 8 to 31% of total local government revenues;&#13;
the median share for the Sulawesi local governments is 15%. The projected growth of locally generated&#13;
revenue is based on the analysis of the past five years' performance. Revenue increases ranged from 8 to&#13;
37% (compound annual rate) and average 19% for all 17 local governnents analyzed in detail, indicating&#13;
significant real revenue growth after allowing for inflation (see Annex 17). Although revenues are still&#13;
below their potential, such largc increments may be more difficult to obtain in the future. Therefore,&#13;
revenue growth has been projected more conservatively.  The project design limits the total project&#13;
investment to a level which the local governrment can afford to counterpart with their own-source revenues&#13;
and INPRES (Presidential instruction including a class of GOI grants) grant entitlements after meeting&#13;
O&amp;M requirements. In accordance with GOI policies, the project at the samc time enhances and&#13;
encourages use of local government and PDAM borrowing capacities, based on the revenue improvements&#13;
scheduled in the RlAPs for the proposed project.  Local governments generally borrow for revenue&#13;
generating investments only, i.e. solid waste collection. sanitation. markets and terminal, for all of which&#13;
user charges are collected. MHA has set a minimum Debt Coverage Ratio of 1:5 which is easily&#13;
achievable by almost all local governments for the modest borrowing they are willing to undertake (see also&#13;
Annex 17). Full direct cost recovery for the sanitation and solid waste subsectors remains problematic;&#13;
however for new markets and transport terminals full cost recovery (debt service, O&amp;M) is feasiblc and has&#13;
been established.&#13;
6.2    PDAM Financial Condition. The majority of the 40 PDAMs in Sulawesi are in a relatively weak&#13;
financial condition. Only in a few cases (e.g. Bitung. Luwxuk and Sungguminesa) do water tariff revenues&#13;
cover operational costs and depreciation, and in some PDAMs revenues are currently insufficient to fully&#13;
support O&amp;M expenditure needs. These problems arise mainly from a combination of: (a) inherited sub-&#13;
optimally designed and located systems serving extended areas with low connections demand and/or&#13;
coverage causing high unit operating costs; (b) often high staff/connections ratios and administration costs&#13;
and overheads; (c) poor maintenance and high physical and "administrative" water losses; and (d)&#13;
infrequent and inadequate tariff adjustments.&#13;
6.3    Water Tariffs. Many PDAMs includcd in the Project have made tariff increases in 1995 or 1996.&#13;
the other plan increases by September 1997; and the increases range between 15 and 50 percent. Further&#13;
substantial real tariff increases of Up to 50% will be made by 1999 to approach (or where feasible reach&#13;
and maintain) full coverage of O&amp;M costs and depreciation charges. The adequacy of tariff levels in each&#13;
participating PDAM will be annually reviewed with assistance from DGCK as needed, and realistic&#13;
forecasts prepared detailing rcquired tariff adjustments. Results of this process would be an important&#13;
component of the annual review of the project. Assurances were obtained duiring Loan negotianons that&#13;
tariff adjustments necessary to mcet the agreed financial viabilitv criteria will be completed on or befbre&#13;
September 30, 1997 and ever)' two years thereafter.&#13;
6.4    Water Supply Investment Finance. PDAM  investment programs wvill be financed by internal&#13;
cash generation, SLA borrowing to the extent feasible oni the basis of PDAM financial capacity projections,&#13;
and the balance of the needed investmernts for which borrowing is not feasible will be financed through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
Ministry of Public Works sectoral DIP allocations as central government equity, partly funded by the&#13;
Bank. The agreed subprojects are generally designed to complete system development or rehabilitate&#13;
systems which were prematurely converted to enterprise status by GOI. Annex 18 gives more details on&#13;
the financial/economic analysis of water supply programs.&#13;
6.5    Classification of PDAM.  Based on the iterative financial analysis of the 38 water supply&#13;
programs proposed by PDAM in Sulawesi, three different categories of PDAM can be differentiated:&#13;
(a)   thirteen medium to large PDAM with investment programs ranging from Rp. 4 to 8.5&#13;
billion which can cover O&amp;M and depreciation, with financial internal rate of return from&#13;
13 to 23% based on a detailed (FINPRO) financial analysis;&#13;
(b)    about 15 mostly medium-sized and some smaller PDAM  with investment programs&#13;
between about Rp.2.0 and 4.0 billion which can only meet incremental O&amp;M, and require&#13;
substantive tariff increases (up to 50% in years two and four) to remain viable; and&#13;
(c)    some twelve mostly smaller (plus some less efficient medium-size) PDAM with investment&#13;
programs ranging from Rp. 600 million to 2 billion which show marginal FIRR (between 8&#13;
and 11%) but requiring more substantial tariff increases which may make water less&#13;
affordable to lower income households, thereby depressing demand. Since their borrowing&#13;
capacity is very limited, central government equity will be provided for basic system&#13;
improvements.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
6.6    Linkage to Country Assistance Strategy and Sector Strategy. As discussed earlier in Sections&#13;
11 and IV, the IUIDP implemented under the East Java/Bali Urban Development Project, SIJUDP and other&#13;
urban development projects represented a significant turning point in the Bank's CAS in general, and its&#13;
urban sector strategy in particular. Establishing the operational feasibility of working with a large number&#13;
of local governments, while utilizing the provincial government as an intermediary program manager, has&#13;
given new practical scope to several of the themes emphasized in the current CAS, including the need to&#13;
improve public services and productivity, to enhance local government responsibility and capacity, and to&#13;
strengthen environment management. The proposed project design continues and broadens the IUIDP&#13;
decentralization successes and reflects the current CAS emphasis through provision of resources for urban&#13;
infrastructure investments, supporting both sectoral and integrated implementation approaches as&#13;
appropriate, strengthening local government institutions for urban management, promoting decentralization&#13;
of responsibility for project planning and implementation, and incorporating environmental considerations&#13;
in urban development. The project also incorporates the pilot development of provincial frameworks for&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement guidelines which address an identified problem area in project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
6.7    Prioritization. Consideration of alternatives, including location of facilities, technology to be&#13;
employed, and prioritization of identified subprojects within a local government jurisdiction, are all&#13;
required by the sub-sectoral Technical Memoranda issued by GOI for preparation of IUIDP proposals by&#13;
local governments. (See Annex 19 for summary of sub-sectoral criteria). In accordance with these agreed&#13;
procedures, alternatives analysis was carried out using varying techniques depending on the sub-sector and&#13;
size of proposed investment (e.g. through standard cost-benefits analysis for large subprojects in water&#13;
supply, urban road and drainage subsectors; least-cost alternative analysis for subprojects in solid waste&#13;
management, human waste/sanitation, kampung improvement programs and market infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
improvement programs; and simple prioritization of extensions to service coverage from existing systems&#13;
based on population served, poverty conditions, and related criteria for smaller subprojects). While&#13;
government involvement in urban infrastructure development is overall justified because of the strong&#13;
environmental, health and social externalities present in the provision of basic urban infrastructure services,&#13;
identification of opportunities for participation by the private sector as well as local community in project&#13;
design and implementation will be specifically included in each local government PJM and encouraged&#13;
wherever appropriate.&#13;
6.8    Cost-Benefit and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis. Since the proposed project provides investments&#13;
in up to seven sectors of urban infrastructure services in 40 local governments, it was necessary to develop&#13;
a structured approach to economic analysis. Subprojects are classified according to investment costs, i.e.&#13;
small (less than Rp.600 million in constant 1994 prices), medium (between Rp.600 million and Rp.3&#13;
billion) and large (over Rp.3 billion). Small subprojects must comply with the agreed planning and design&#13;
criteria and their economic viability is presumed based on evaluation of similar subprojects implemented&#13;
under previous operations and the demonstrated affordability of the technical standards adopted. Medium&#13;
size subprojects are subject to a simplified economic analysis, utilizing thresholds to select investznent&#13;
options, a sampling of which is reviewed by the Bank. Large subprojects must go through a more rigorous&#13;
economic feasibility analysis, with all assumptions and methodology subject to Bank review on a case by&#13;
case basis. Serious efforts were made by GOI and their preparation consultants to screen and analyze the&#13;
proposed subprojects using sound technical, financial and economic criteria. This scrutiny went through a&#13;
further iteration involving Bank staff prior to negotiations. Cost-cffectiveness is assured by checking unit&#13;
costs against average costs (from this and previous projects), and by building to basic minimum standards&#13;
only (see Annex 18 and also 19 for more details).&#13;
6.9    Water Supply. The existing water supply systems suffer from many problems. Piped water&#13;
connection coverage is generally low, ranging from less than 20% to maximum 73%. Due to poor&#13;
maintenance and deterioration of older systems, almost all distribution and connection pipes are leaking,&#13;
causing water contamination and large water losses -- UFW of many systems is over 40% which includes&#13;
'"dministrative" causes (such as illegal connections) which are often considerable. Source supply and&#13;
reservoir capacity are also often inadequate. To address these problems, the water supply program will&#13;
improve water quality and reliability by installing secondary and tertiary distribution system extensions,&#13;
repairing old systems and treatment facilities, as needed, and providing house connections and also&#13;
standpipes. Water loss reduction programs will be undertaken in all towns with the aim to reduce the rate&#13;
of UFW  losses from  their current averages of 35-40%  to about 25%.  Storage reservoirs will be&#13;
constructed to increase system capacity, but new source development will generally be deferred unless there&#13;
is serious water shortage. The main benefits are increased availability of clean, piped water at reduced&#13;
costs. Demand surveys of current and potential users of the water supply systems were conducted in&#13;
several sample urban service areas. Some towns show low demand (either because good quality shallow&#13;
ground water is still available, or residents have lost hope for public water supply). Other systems suffer&#13;
from water shortages in many service areas and from poor water quality and high cost of alternative&#13;
sources of water. Lastly, a few systems are very high cost operations due to local constraints or possibly&#13;
poor management. Net present values (NPV) and FIRR using full FINPRO analysis was calculated for&#13;
medium and large water thirteen investment programs in excess of Rp. 4 billion. FIRR is used as a lower&#13;
bound estimate of economic rate of retum. A 12 percent rate of return is used as the minimum feasible&#13;
rate, in part key to the proposed 11.75 percent on-lending rate for subsidiary loan agreements under the&#13;
project.&#13;
6.10   Urban Roads.  Urban road transport is frustrated by a lack of a well integrated major road&#13;
networks in most towns. Moreover, most district roads are in a state of serious deterioration due to heavy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
traffic, poor maintenance and inadequate drainage systems. In the larger cities (Ujung Pandang and&#13;
Manado in particular) traffic is congested on major roads and in the business centers, especially during&#13;
peak hours, as a result of inadequate traffic management. The urban road component of the proposed&#13;
project will provide a program of widening of major roads and bridges, rehabilitation and maintenance of&#13;
mostly district (local) roads, including improvement of drainage, curbs and sidewalks, and construction of&#13;
new road sections where important network links are missing, or to provide access to newly developed&#13;
areas. Traffic management programs will also be initiated in the larger towns. Routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance needs have been identified, and the road agencies will have maintenance budget increases to&#13;
undertake improved road maintenance. The Yellow Cover of the Roads Sector Study (Report No. 15394-&#13;
IND) clearly documents the high priority and significant rates of return of investments in urban areas for&#13;
improved accessibility, savings in vehicle operating costs and in road construction and maintenance&#13;
expenditures, and increased land and other property values. Since specific detailed traffic counts were not&#13;
available for the medium and smaller towns, the investments were selected on the basis of their importance&#13;
to complete and better integrate the local road network, to improve traffic flows and to provide better&#13;
access to residential communities or areas of economic activities. Priority in subproject selection was given&#13;
to repair and rehabilitation over new construction of roads. Network maps identifying the key links and&#13;
deficiencies have been prepared for all towns and will be in the Project File.&#13;
6.11   Solid Waste Management. Currently less than half of all solid waste generated in towns is being&#13;
collected. Collection and disposal equipment capacities fall short of fast growing demand. Much of the&#13;
existing equipment is non-operational at any point in time due to inappropriate operation and lack of&#13;
maintenance. Access roads to waste disposal sites are also inadequate. The solid waste management&#13;
component will increase collection coverage to nearly 80% and additional waste transfer depots will be&#13;
constructed and capacities of existing TPAs will be expanded and new sites developed. Collection and&#13;
disposal site equipment will be purchased and programs to improve operation and maintenance of&#13;
equipment and TPAs will be implemented.  In addition, appropriate access roads to TPAs will be&#13;
constructed. Although TPAs and collection vehicles and containers usually require the vast majority of&#13;
investment funds, the project will also focus on 'softer" complementary activities such as composting,&#13;
recycling and waste minimization.&#13;
6.12   The benefits of the solid waste management component arise from cleaner air and water as a result&#13;
of reduced burning and dumping of solid waste into rivers and drains, and improved public health by&#13;
reduction of disease-bearing pests, as well as from more efficient collection and treatment. As the benefits&#13;
are mainly health and environment related, they are difficult to quantify. The planning was based on&#13;
increasing service coverage to minimum standards while keeping rates within the (rather low) limits of&#13;
affordability and willingness to pay-based on the sample real demand surveys, and environmental/public&#13;
health necessity. The design was based on least cost alternatives. The cost recovery will gradually&#13;
improve under the project in accordance with the agreed RIAP which specifically addresses the solid waste&#13;
tariff issue in each jurisdiction, so that by the end of project implementation O&amp;M, costs plus depreciation&#13;
will be covered by the user charges.&#13;
6.13   Human Waste/Sanitation. Sludge treatment facilities and collection equipment are inadequate&#13;
and wastewater treatment facilities simply do not exist in most towns in Sulawesi. Desludging volume&#13;
from septic tanks is commonly less than 20% of the estimated volume produced. Public awareness of the&#13;
health benefits of sludge and wastewater treatment and disposal is also lacking. The sanitation component&#13;
will provide and sludge collection treatment facilities and in assist to install or rehabilitate individual or&#13;
community on-site sanitation facilities (septic tanks) with community participation and household loan&#13;
programs. There will also be a community based sanitation education program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
6.14   Drainage/Flood Control. Low lying areas in many towns in Sulawesi are subject to frequent&#13;
flooding due to poor maintenance of old systems, insufficient capacity, and inappropriate designs, or in&#13;
some towns, due to irrigation channels functioning as drainage canals without the necessary modifications.&#13;
The proposed project will implement programs to improve O&amp;M, rehabilitate drainage canals, and&#13;
normalize river banks. The benefits are reduced flood-caused damage, reduced traffic disruption, increased&#13;
land values, and improved health, especially of poor people residing in low lying and flood-prone areas.&#13;
The benefits are not easily quantifiable, but the NPV and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) have&#13;
been calculated assuming an average land value increase of 100 percent as a result of the reduced flooding.&#13;
For smaller, central areas, larger land value increases have been assumed, while 5 percent only was used&#13;
for undeveloped land. These assumptions are based on surveys which indicate land value increases of up to&#13;
500 percent following completion of town drainage schemes. The calculated EIRR range from 10 to over&#13;
100 Percent-the latter for schemes which affect relatively large developed areas. The economic analysis&#13;
resulted in the rejection of about 20 percent of all proposed schemes, and some subprojects still require&#13;
technical review because of their high unit costs per hectare of flooded area.&#13;
6.15   KIP/MIIP. The KIP component will provide basic infrastructure services including public toilets,&#13;
solid waste collection, foot path, water supply, and drainage. Market infrastructure improvements,&#13;
including improvements to superstructures, will also be provided under the project. As several recent&#13;
project audits and reviews by OED show, KIP has immediate and very positive impacts on the living&#13;
conditions (i.e., access to motor roads, water facilities, drainage. garbage collection, sanitation, lighting,&#13;
education and health facilities) of kampung residents using low cost technologies. It is further shown that&#13;
the areas surrounding the KIP sites also benefit from KIPs as the physical and economic impacts of KIPs&#13;
extend to neighboring communities. Moreover, the KIP scheme has been replicated throughout the cities,&#13;
without the Bank financing (OED Report 14747-4ND documents these findings; see previous reference in&#13;
para. 2.4). MIIP investments are also very much needed and are more than covered from municipal fees on&#13;
the vendors, who participate in deciding the improvements. Capital investments will be complemented with&#13;
market vendor and community based working groups to ensure better implementation and more appropriate&#13;
investment strategies. The vendor-based credit union in Makale is an encouraging example of this&#13;
enhanced private sector and community-based participation. Formal economic analysis is not carried out&#13;
for KIP and MIIP because of the difficulties in quantifying benefits. But improvements are subject to the&#13;
least cost analysis according to the agreed standards.&#13;
6.16   Quantitative Sensitivity Analysis. Quantitative sensitivity analysis was carried out as an integral&#13;
part of the quantitative economic analysis for the subprojects in the water supply and drainage subsectors.&#13;
Typical scenarios include demand reductions, cost increases, and project implementation delays. The&#13;
extent of the increases or decreases assumed for the sensitivity analysis was based on the implementation&#13;
experiences of similar type of urban infrastructure investment projects. Special attention was given to&#13;
designs for those subprojects whose rate of returns were close to the absolute cut-off rate of 10%, and final&#13;
project design and selection took into account the results of the sensitivity analysis by either modifying&#13;
them or deferring them for more detailed review and modifications prior to implementation and possible&#13;
elimination from the program.&#13;
6.17   Poverty Analysis. This project is considered part of the program of targeted interventions. As&#13;
previously noted in Section 3, urban poverty in Sulawesi towns is a serious problem due to the poverty&#13;
incidence being substantially higher than the national average. The project design has, in accordance with&#13;
GOI guidelines for IUIDP programming, given priority to facilities and services improvements for poor&#13;
neighborhoods in each project town, it is mostly the poor who lack access to clean and affordable water,&#13;
waste disposal facilities, and other basic services, and who usually reside in low-lying areas or along drains&#13;
and river banks that are often affected by frequent flooding. This project is expected to alleviate such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
impacts as many components are especially targeted at improving the quality of life and environment in the&#13;
such areas. However, no explicit poverty alleviation component is proposed.&#13;
6.18   The water supply component would increase the access of the poor to clean water while reducing&#13;
the costs. An installment payment plan would be provided for piped water house connections who would&#13;
otherwise not be able to afford them. Water bills for basic lifeline supply would be kept to less than 5% of&#13;
the expenditures of low-income households. The drainage/flood control component would reduce the&#13;
frequency and duration of floods in the poor, low-lying areas. It would reduce property damage and&#13;
improve health conditions caused by stagnant polluted water in the neighborhoods, and also reduce access&#13;
disruptions. The human and solid waste disposal/treatment components would reduce morbidity and&#13;
improve health conditions of the poor. The road improvement program, which would also improve&#13;
conditions for non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians, would also benefit the poor. The KIP/MIIP&#13;
component, which is targeted on densely populated poor neighborhoods, would substantially improve the&#13;
living conditions of the very poor by providing basic infrastructure services at very low costs.&#13;
6.19   Environmental Improvements. Environmental management and mitigation measures have been&#13;
built into the design and cost of subprojects, and institutional arrangements have been made for monitoring&#13;
impacts on the environment, taking into account of the implementation experiences of previous subprojects&#13;
implemented in some Sulawesi towns under SIJUDP. The project will have a positive impact on the&#13;
environment through water supply, urban road improvements, solid and human waste disposal, drainage&#13;
and flood control and kampung improvement program. For instance, the water supply subprojects will&#13;
provide clean water and reduce ground water depletion. The urban road maintenance and upgrading and&#13;
side drains improvement will reduce air pollution and fuel consumption per kilometer through improved&#13;
road capacities, surfaces and traffic management. Improvement of solid and human waste disposal will&#13;
reduce soil and water contamination. Drainage and flood control will reduce flooding and flood-related&#13;
problems. (Frequent flooding brings water highly contaminated by solid and human waste into direct&#13;
contact with people and causes severe health hazards). KIP will, to a varying extent, incorporate all of&#13;
these improvements.&#13;
6.20   Economic Performance Indicators. The monitoring of economic performance of the project will&#13;
essentially be included in the system of monitoring and performance indicators described for the whole&#13;
program in Annex 5. Particularly as the key data for benefit calculation are included in the routine project&#13;
monitoring system, it will be relatively simple to estimate the economic benefit/perforrnance of subprojects&#13;
or larger aggregations as may be required.&#13;
6.21   In addition to the technical, financial and economic aspects, one of the most important indicator&#13;
should be the general public's perception of how well their services arc being provided. Moreover, the&#13;
needs and priorities of each community are different. Therefore, indicators should be customized for each&#13;
community. The proposed indicators will measure: (a) how well urban services are provided in water&#13;
supply, transportation, drainage, solid and human waste disposal; and (b) how well local municipalities&#13;
function in terms of municipal govemance, community feedback and environmental quality. Each local&#13;
government and PDAM will have a specific set of agreed performance indicators corresponding to their&#13;
individual project targets.&#13;
C. RISKS&#13;
6.22   There are two main risks for this project:  firstly the selection and quality of the physical&#13;
investments may be seriously deficient; and secondly, the efforts at capacity building of local government&#13;
staff and institutions may not take hold. Deficient physical implementation could be a result of poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
selection of subprojects within a subsector or between subsectors, weak analysis, wrong prioritization, or&#13;
inadequate quality due to defective design or lack of good supervision. Capacity building efforts may fail&#13;
because the local staff lack interest or motivation, there is high staff turnover, little local leadership and&#13;
minimal involvement and guidance from the two senior levels of governments.&#13;
6.23   Two approaches will be employed to minimize these risks: firstly, a strong, provincially based, but&#13;
local government-oriented implementation support strategy will be employed, and secondly, Bank&#13;
supervision will be close and involved especially during the first two years. The implementation support&#13;
team will include experienced local government practitioners who will provide practical advice and support,&#13;
to the PPMU and, through frequent regular visits to the local governments, they will seek to ensure&#13;
subproject selection and quality, by checking analysis, design and supervision, and through working closely&#13;
with local government staff train them on the job to better manage, solve problems, coordinate and perform&#13;
their duties. By locating a team in each service and a central support team also on Ujung Pandang not only&#13;
will there be greater focus on action on the ground, rather than paper reporting, but also develop in&#13;
communication and disseminating are expected to be avoided. But they will also be available to spot&#13;
serious weaknesses, recommend solutions, and provide trouble shooting and backstopping advice before&#13;
problems escalate. Low quality investments or execution, and lack of progress in institutional development&#13;
will be identified readily and addressed by the team.&#13;
6.24   The Bank supervision will be more proactive, and will work and liaise closely with the Central&#13;
Government (TKPP/Bappenas and DGCK) and with provincial management units. Resident staff in&#13;
Indonesia will be in frequent contact for ready advice and problem-solving, and where necessary field&#13;
visits. The Annual Implementation Review by the Bank provides a regular opportunity to do quality&#13;
control, correct, re-direct and improve physical or institutional weaknesses at an early stage and also&#13;
reinforce, recognize and publicize good performance.&#13;

SECOND SULAWESI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Studies Carried Out During Project Preparation&#13;
Water Resources - Pare Pare and Pangkajene. During pre-appraisal in March 1995, these two towns were&#13;
identified as having high iron and manganese content in their groundwater s which significantly contributed to&#13;
performance problems of the local PDAMs. Consultants were funded through the New Zealand Consultant&#13;
Trust Fund to recommend simple measures that could be taken to minimize this problem. This report is&#13;
finalized and recommendations and conclusions have been incorporated into project design.&#13;
Composting Pilot - FIAHS Funds. Through the World Bank's FIAHS fund, community based composting&#13;
activities in three areas - Bali, East Java, and Sulawesi - were piloted. Programs are still underway. In&#13;
Sulawesi, efforts were concentrated in Ujung Pandang through the University of Ujung Pandang and the NGO,&#13;
Partner of the Environment. Results have been promising and composting applications have been expanded&#13;
within project design and will be further encouraged during implementation.&#13;
TPA Siting and Operations Study. In almost all Sulawesi towns, a short-coming was quickly identified; waste&#13;
disposal sites (TPAs) are poorly sited and operated. Suitable government guidelines exist, however, they are&#13;
generally ignored. A 'hands-on" study is underway to bring about improvements in TPA operations. The&#13;
simplified "operations manual"will be used throughout project implementation and supervision activities. The&#13;
study was funded by an Australian Consultant Trust Fund and will be presented at project launch.&#13;
Tourism Study - Tana Toraja. During project appraisal the Bupati of Makale expressed concem about the&#13;
sensitivity of local culture and tourist attractions vis-a-vis local development. An application was made to the&#13;
French Consultant Trust Fund to explore ways to protect local cultural attractions and identify infrastructure&#13;
deficiencies which may hinder the positive further development of high quality tourism business in Tana Toraja.&#13;
Work is underway and should be completed by September 1996.&#13;
Sanitation Altematives - Toli Toli. As part of a research project, funded by the World Bank, on sanitation&#13;
alternatives in areas of high ground water, field research was carried out in Toli Toli (in addition to Banjirmasin,&#13;
Kalimantan). Field work was completed in August 1995 and the most promising options have been incorporated&#13;
into project design.&#13;
Drainage Study - Bitung. Bitung's PJM requested extensive investments in Sabo dams. These dams prevent&#13;
catastrophic debris flows from volcano slopes, however, due to the high costs and relatively untried (in&#13;
Sulawesi) technology, the investments needed to be more closely studied. Expert consultants, financed by the&#13;
New Zealand Consultant Trust Fund were engaged, and with the assistance of the East Java Sabo Dam Institute,&#13;
they refined the overall design of the investment component. Recommendations have been incorporated into&#13;
project design.&#13;

Second Sulawesi Urban Development Project&#13;
Real Demand Surveys -&#13;
The Use of Community Surveys in the Preparation&#13;
Clear and transparent avenues of community consultation by local governments are generally&#13;
absent in Sulawesi. Government leaders are appointed through the central government and are most&#13;
accountable to provincial and national authorities. In order to try to obtain a better measure of the&#13;
community's infrastructure demands and priorities "real demand surveys" were carried out.&#13;
The surveys were designed to provide in depth community consultation and allow tailoring of&#13;
infrastructure investments specific to each community. The surveys covered household structure&#13;
(age/sex, education, economic activity, migration, place of work, income, and ownership of selected&#13;
items - e.g. television), housing (tenure, sanitation), water (sources, consumption, cost), willingness to&#13;
pay for infrastructure improvements, flooding, waste disposal, and general suggestions for community&#13;
improvement.&#13;
At the request of local governments, seven Sulawesi towns were surveyed (Sungguminasa,&#13;
Pangkajene, Senkang, Makale, Rantepao, Tondano, and Bitung). Approximately 300 households&#13;
were surveyed in each town.&#13;
The surveys were carried out by the provincial Bureau of Statistics for a relative low cost (Rp.&#13;
1.2 million, $600). The surveys can be readily expanded and applied to all project towns. As part of&#13;
project monitoring, surveys will be carried out to track consumer satisfaction and improvements over&#13;
baseline conditions.&#13;
The following nine tables represent some of the survey's main findings.&#13;

SECOND SULAWESI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
The proposed project's main development objective - to improve the delivery of urban infrastructure&#13;
services by the local governments in a sustainable manner - requires a broad set of performance indicators to&#13;
truly reflect the project's long-term impact. In order to monitor thc project's overall achievements, five groups&#13;
of performance indicators have been proposed: 1) Services Performance; 2) Poverty Alleviation; 3) Urban&#13;
Environment; 4) Sustainability of Development; and 5) Social Impact (see Table 1).&#13;
Group I indicators will monitor Physical and Financial target accomplishments such as meters of road&#13;
constructed, or increases in revenue, however as shown through previous experience, e.g. SIJUDP, this is not&#13;
sufficient to adequately reflect a project's long-term sustainability. Therefore Group 2-5 indicators, building on&#13;
the results of Group 1, would measure the sustainability of the infrastructure investments by evaluating quality&#13;
and efficiency of local government's investments and operations. Group 2 to 5 are intended to measure the&#13;
project's impact, as well as non-project related community accomplishments. Many of the indicators in these&#13;
four groups will require professional judgment to rank into HS-Highly Satisfactory, S-Satisfactory, U-&#13;
Unsatisfactory and HU-Highly Unsatisfactory. As part of their required activities, the provincial&#13;
Implementation Support teams will provide this service.&#13;
Meaningful targets are difficult to define for monitoring of poverty alleviation and social impact&#13;
progress. Yet these areas are considered key components of a commnunity's "social infrastructure". The project&#13;
aims to promote a long term attitudinal shift in the way things are done and it is proposed to monitor&#13;
quantitative progress in these areas as indicators of long-term attitudinal shifts.&#13;
The urban environment indicators are intended to provide useful and relatively easy to obtain, sunogate&#13;
environmental measurements. They should be sufficient to indicate a community's overall efforts towards&#13;
environmental protection.&#13;
Group 4 - Sustainability of Development have components similar to the baseline targets established in&#13;
Group 1, however these management targets are designed to evaluate the quality and efficiency of gains in these&#13;
areas; not just absolute amounts. In order to reflect the unique characteristics of each community, Group 4d&#13;
facilitates target customization. The community, through the annual APIP review process, would select priority&#13;
areas where the community will focus activities in the upcoming year.&#13;

SECOND SULAWESI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT&#13;
In addition to infrastructure investments, implementation support is also a major focus of the Sccond&#13;
Sulawesi Urban Development Project (SULUDP-2). The lessons of the Sulawesi Irian Jaya Project arc clear:&#13;
(a) infrastructure investments  must have competent agencies to operate and maintain them, (b) current&#13;
strategies for "technical assistance" are not providing adequate results, and (c) institutional reforms must have&#13;
coordinated short, medium and long-term goals. When asked what was the most critical assistance thcy needed,&#13;
a local government official in Sulawesi replied, "we need the help of someone who knows how to run one of&#13;
'these things', somebody who's done it before, who can make it work, and keep it working."&#13;
The long term goal of the implementation support strategy is to have municipalities that can -- on their&#13;
own -- identify, prioritize and budget for infrastructure needs, operate and maintain facilities -- both existing and&#13;
those newly acquired -- and retain professional staff who can provide the skills necessary to maximize the social,&#13;
environmental and economic benefits of local infrastructure. It is expected that these capabilities will be more&#13;
or less in place in Sulawesi towns within five to seven years. To achieve this goal, the local government&#13;
assistance strategy in SULUDP-2 will be more "hands-on" and focused.&#13;
During project preparation, extensive discussions were held with various national, provincial and local&#13;
government officials on the structure of the implementation support team. The support structure was also&#13;
extensively discussed during negotiations and is summarized in the Minutes of Technical Discussions.&#13;

SECOND SULAWESI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
IMPROVING MUNICIPAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
During project preparation and appraisal, some key needs in the management of local governments were&#13;
identified with respect to the provision of municipal infrastructure and services. These needs are typical for&#13;
smaller, more remote local governments in all countries. The implementation support strategy is therefore&#13;
designed to be flexible and relevant for each community.&#13;
The key areas of need, generic to all Sulawesi communities are described below. Actions over the five&#13;
year project period will be targeted in these seven areas.&#13;
1.    Accountability. There is a need for greater local responsibility for actions taken and increased debate&#13;
on why certain decisions are made. Staff need to feel empowered to present solutions most suitable for their&#13;
specific community.&#13;
2.    Job Understanding. There is limited understanding on the part of some workers regarding their roles&#13;
and responsibilities.&#13;
3.     Financial Management. There is limited analysis of the costs of individual tasks or operations, and&#13;
hence is not clear if available money is being spent wisely.&#13;
4.     Professionalism. Young engineers and other professionals joining local governments from university&#13;
need greater mentoring and support.&#13;
5.     Public Consultation. There is a need for greater consultation on service levels and infrastructure needs&#13;
to increase ownership. Many activities appear to be developed in isolation from the community and only&#13;
afterwards are affected members of the community advised of government intentions.&#13;
6.     Staff Development. Planned programs of staff training and development, especially in the smaller&#13;
towns, are necessary to increase the quality of service.&#13;
7.     Private Sector. Many areas of service delivery can be performed by private sector contractors at&#13;
considerable savings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 1 of 2&#13;
SECOND SULAWESI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
INCREASED PRIVATE SECTOR AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT&#13;
Communities in Sulawesi already have some limited experience in using the private sector. However in&#13;
many conmmunities the private sector is poorly developed and is often reluctant to enter into government&#13;
contracts.&#13;
A three part action plan will be implemented to enhance the role of the private sector. First, the&#13;
inclusion of an experienced municipal manager in the assistance tcam to support development of a community&#13;
specific program. Private Sector investments in selected subprojects , and the entire implementation support&#13;
team providing five years of continuous assistance to local governments.&#13;
Each community would be assisted in the first year to prepare a simple strategy that identifies the&#13;
following:&#13;
* services that could be carried out by the private sector with their current capabilities;&#13;
* services that the local governments would like to see carried out by the private sector in the future;&#13;
* mechanisms to strengthen local businesses, and a timetable;&#13;
* constraints within the existing government organization for further involving the private sector;&#13;
- improvements needed to the systems and procedures for awarding and supervising contracts.&#13;
Following, is an indicative list of areas to be evaluated by the private sector expert during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Roads. Private sector involvement in the road sector could include: road design and needs assessment;&#13;
major construction; overlay of existing roads; minor and major repairs; street sweeping and drainage ditch&#13;
maintenance; supply of asphalt and other building materials; road marking; and traffic light maintenance.&#13;
Water Supply. Services which could be provided by the PS range from water meter reading to area&#13;
franchises, and include water sales by tanker truck or in containers.&#13;
Markets. Private sector involvement could include: daily cleansing and waste removal;&#13;
building maintenance; fee collection and allocation of stalls; and provision of the entire infrastructure.&#13;
Waste Management. PSP in waste management could cover areas such as: full operation of TPAs,&#13;
including siting, and land ownership; equipment provision and/or operation;&#13;
composting; waste collection - primary and secondary; vehicle and equipment servicing and maintenance; street&#13;
sweeping; and septic tank emptying and IPLT operation.&#13;
Slaughterhouses.   Local governments should consider phasing out the public operation of&#13;
slaughterhouses and instead enforce guidelines for the safe and hygienic operation of these facilities through a&#13;
simple license system. The private sector should be encouraged to operate the slaughterhouses.&#13;
Transport Terminals. For existing facilities, maintenance, fee collection and vending permits could be&#13;
carried out by the private sector. Licensing terminal operations (even including land and facility construction);&#13;
management contracts are all options that should be explored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
Drainage. Maintenance of small local drains could be better carried out by the private sector. Larger&#13;
scale drain cleaning can also be effectively tied with solid waste collection, as in Jakarta.&#13;
Building and Vehicle Maintenance.  Simple maintenance contracts beginning with standard&#13;
housekeeping services should be considered by local governments and eventually expanded to include major&#13;
renovations.&#13;
Pooling service areas. Local governments should explore possibilities for economies of scales by&#13;
combining some service areas, e.g. regional TPA for both Rantepao and Makale.&#13;

SECOND SULAWESI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
1. Overall Context&#13;
1.    A regional environmental assessment was completed by consultants to the Ministry of Public Work's&#13;
Directorate General of Human Settlements, in close cooperation and consultation with local agencies and&#13;
residents from March to June 1995. The infrastructure investments in IUIDP are designed to improve overall&#13;
municipal management and minimize damages to the local environment. Efforts are needed to ensure that&#13;
secondary environmental and social impacts are not caused by these investments.  However, residual&#13;
environmental problems may have more to do with contextual problems, rather than being a direct consequence&#13;
of the investments themselves. It is, therefore, of greater value to analyze the environmental context as well as&#13;
the impacts of the infrastructure investments in order to ensure that mitigation measures address the problems as&#13;
a whole and not just those parts that are the consequence of the relatively small infrastructure investments.&#13;
2.    The regional environmental assessment identified the main environmental problems in the Sulawesi&#13;
Towns as:&#13;
(a) health risks arising from contamination of domestic water sources, and especially domestic wells;&#13;
(b) poor domestic sanitation contributing to chronic water pollution of local and other water bodies;&#13;
(c) flooding, resulting in part from inadequate drainage, but exacerbated everywhere by drain&#13;
blockage due to inadequate maintenance and solid waste;&#13;
(d) poorly managed solid waste resulting in random dumping and accumulation along roadsides in and&#13;
around the towns;&#13;
(e) poorly located and managed official solid waste disposal sites that are often little or no&#13;
improvement over random dumping; and&#13;
(f)  poorly managed markets which are unsanitary due to blocked drains accumulated solid waste, and&#13;
inadequate or lacking water supply and/or sanitation facilities.&#13;
3.    In addition to these generic problems, the various towns may be grouped according to their geographical&#13;
features. Towns in more mountainous settings where soils are subject to erosion are more liable to experience&#13;
flash flooding problems and much attention to drainage is required. Towns in flat, irrigated areas are also liable&#13;
to flooding where inadequate attention is paid to filling ex-sawa (rice paddy) land. In coastal towns, houses&#13;
built on stilts over tidal flats present difficult sanitary problems.&#13;
11. Analysis of Environmental Problems&#13;
4.     Significant environmental issues identified in the environmental assessment include water resources,&#13;
sanitation, flooding and drainage, solid waste management, construction impacts, traffic and accessibility&#13;
impacts, industrial impacts, markets, parks and gardens, urban fringe problems, and regional resource&#13;
management. The most important are outlined below.&#13;
5.    Water Resources and Sanitation. The most serious problem related to water resources is contamination&#13;
from human and solid waste. Most citizens have private toilets, but practically all toilets are connected to&#13;
unlined pits. The main consequence is that ground water becomes increasingly polluted and wells are severely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
87&#13;
ANNEX 16&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
contaminated. An associated concern is that open stormn water drains also contain human waste deposited&#13;
directly or via seepage from poorly constructed toilet pits and poorly functioning septic tank outlets.&#13;
6.    Flooding, and Drainaige.  Although large scale flooding is relatively rare, many neighborhoods&#13;
experience very regular flooding for short periods. The reasons include soil erosion; inadequate drainage&#13;
systems; drain blockages; poor maintenance; the inherent difficulty of draining areas of ex-sawa (rice paddy);&#13;
and housing in coastal towns being built on stilts over cleared mangroves.&#13;
7.     Solid Waste Manapement. The problems include: the TPAs are difficult to service, hand carts are&#13;
often not being used, only a small portion of waste disposed of by the public is collected; coordination between&#13;
market management and solid waste authorities is poor; and formal disposal sites are usually just open dumps.&#13;
Waste minimization and recycling are not part of the standard waste management model.&#13;
8.    Construction Impacts. Construction inevitably disrupts daily life; however with poor management,&#13;
these problems are exacerbated with: (a) poor planning and the works being completed more slowly than&#13;
necessary; (b) untidy construction sites leading to additional dust, drain blockages and increased noise; and (c)&#13;
inadequate attention to safety.&#13;
9.     Markets. Two sets of persistent problems occur in markets. First, the needs of fresh food vendors are&#13;
not adequately considered, resulting in conditions that not only affect the environment, but also pose a health&#13;
risk to customers. Second, markets are generally poorly managed. Poor relations between market management&#13;
and local goverments lead to inadequate service provision.&#13;
10.   Parks and Gardens. In most towns some attention has been given to planting in pubic places and&#13;
especially to lining streets with trees or planters. However, maintenance of public planting is generally sporadic&#13;
and in many places unmaintained planters become depositories for rubbish. Vacant sites are common and&#13;
remain unmaintained and attract solid waste dumping, giving them a general feel of dereliction.&#13;
11.    Urban Fringe Problems and Regional Resource Management. The impact of urban development on the&#13;
surrounding countryside and more broadly the resource implications of emerging development pattems are&#13;
issues relevant to good urban management and to long-term environmental health and sustainability. The&#13;
following points should be kept in mind. First, erosion causes siltation of rivers and drains, encouraging&#13;
flooding. Second, all towns should have one property sited and operated solid waste disposal site. Third,&#13;
upstream water extraction is based on convenience, without reference to the impact downstream. Fourth, urban&#13;
expansion will reduce the efficiency of the irrigation systems. Fifth, many of the towns are expanding into&#13;
natural forest areas of considerable value. Some serve as watershed protection areas upstream of springs used&#13;
to for the town water supply system. Sixth and finally, the towns in the program are developing in a haphazard&#13;
way, leading to extremely inefficient infrastructure provision.&#13;
III. Mitigation, Management and Monitoring&#13;
12.   The environmental analysis of each PJM  identifies residual environmental problems that could be&#13;
expected to persist following the PJM infrastructure investment unless appropriate measures are taken. In the&#13;
environmental management framework, such measures fall into the two categories of mitigation and monitoring&#13;
for which appropriate recommendations have to be made under the headings, respectively of UKL and UPL. In&#13;
the process of completing the PJM environmental sections, a number of issues have repeatedly arisen where it&#13;
has become clear that a common approach, in most cases supported by the Tk I agencies, or from the national&#13;
government, would be appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88&#13;
ANNEX 16&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
13.   Water Resources. Many towns would benefit from a survey of local water resources to ascertain the&#13;
most cost-effective and appropriate sequence in which to tap the resources for the supply system. Such surveys&#13;
could also indicate a measure to protect the water source. These surveys should also provide a basis for&#13;
allocating the resources where there is potentially escalating competition between users. Some towns in this&#13;
program are located in areas subject to intense irrigation, and competition for water between irrigation and&#13;
urban supply needs is serious. The risks of contamination of domestic water supplies are well recognized and&#13;
additional measures will need to be taken such as: (a) sampling by the PDAMs and bacteriological testing by&#13;
the health department, but programs to deal with problems once encountered are in many cases still weak; (b)&#13;
ambient water sources (rivers, canals, lakes) should also be sampled from time to time where these are used for&#13;
bathing, washing and occasionally drinking; and (c) care in placing pipe-work needs to be taken.&#13;
14.    Sanitation.  Financing is to be made available and encouragement given to individual households&#13;
without toilets to install them. The program will promote the installation of properly constructed septic tanks.&#13;
In poorer and more congested areas, a program for constructing communal septic tanks is proposed. The&#13;
program will also finance the purchase of a vacuum truck and the construction of a sludge treatment facility,&#13;
generally located together with the solid waste disposal site.&#13;
15.   A Real Demand Survey indicated that there is a lack of awareness of the potentially serious health&#13;
problems associated with makeshift sanitary arrangements which currently prevail in all the towns. The&#13;
fragmented programs and activities of the various agencies responsible for improving sanitary conditions need to&#13;
be forged into a single integrated program with the following elements: (a) coordinating public education and&#13;
training programs; (b) monitoring, encouraging and if necessary enforcing good practice; (c) monitoring&#13;
domestic and ambient water; (d) using monitoring results to properly sequence improvements to water supply&#13;
and sanitation; and (e) formulating proposals for further improvements in sanitation.&#13;
16.   Drainage and Flood Control. Flooding and in general poor drainage are common problems in the towns&#13;
in this program. None of the towns have a complete drainage system and few even have a proper main drainage&#13;
and flood control plan. Such a plan is a first priority. Lack of maintenance of drains has also been highlighted&#13;
as a problem in the PJMs and funding must be made available for maintenance. The following points are&#13;
stressed:&#13;
(a) Poor design and construction of local drainage systems are problems that must be overcome by the&#13;
public works department taking a greater interest and control over the specification and&#13;
construction of local drains;&#13;
(b) Keeping drains clear requires preventive as well as remedial action. Preventive measures must&#13;
include erosion control and other anti-siltation measures, avoiding laying pipes and cables through&#13;
drains and eliminating the dumping of solid waste in drains;&#13;
(c) The clearing of local drains needs to be turned into a formally organized regular activity; and&#13;
(d) Difficulties in many towns that are expanding over mangrove swamps where houses on stilts are&#13;
built on mud flat sites which were in the past flushed out by the tides, and are particularly difficult&#13;
to provide with infrastructure. This problem must first be studied and a coherent set of measures&#13;
proposed.&#13;
17.    Solid Waste Management. The local governments' solid waste management systems currently serve&#13;
only a small portion of the population. In many towns the quality of service is poor and the PJMs therefore call&#13;
for appropriate institutional strengthening. Many PJMs recommend the establishment of composting facilities&#13;
run by the local governments. In the past, a model for solid waste was promoted in which systems managed by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
89&#13;
ANNEX 16&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
the local government were to be complemented by individual action and community involvement. The&#13;
community has a vital role to play in any effective solid waste management system and this component therefore&#13;
needs to be developed as follows:&#13;
(a) Participating communities need to be empowered through motivation and organization. There&#13;
must also be an effective incentive and cost-recovery system;&#13;
(b) Until now the emphasis has been entirely on waste removal and disposal, a major shift is necessary&#13;
towards waste reduction and reuse/recycling. The following activities should be developed: (i)&#13;
households should be encouraged to separate organic waste from dry waste; (ii) where they have&#13;
gardens, households should compost the organic part and use it for soil conditioning; (iii) local&#13;
governments should help in the establishment of neighborhood materials collection systems;&#13;
(c) Local governments need to attend closely to community systems, assisting, and where necessary,&#13;
applying sanctions where residents fail in their responsibilities; and&#13;
(d) In addition to their traditional waste management tasks, local governments should support waste&#13;
reuse and recycling systems as noted above.&#13;
18.    Solid Waste Disposal. There is a general need to improve both the choice of sites for final disposal of&#13;
solid waste and the preparation and management of these sites. A number of crucial technical inputs must be&#13;
included:  (a) distance from  other human activities; (b) ability to accommodate sufficient waste, (c)&#13;
geomorphology; (d) hydrological and geological conditions; (e) local ecology; and (f) cost of land and cost of&#13;
operations. Simple measures to make substantial improvements include: (a) where feasible, the choice of sites&#13;
which have inherent management advantages; (b) pre-engineering of the sites; (c) simple leachate collection&#13;
systems; (d) general control and management of the site and organizing waste picking activities. Consultants&#13;
should be used to prepare the necessary drawings and supervise construction. However it is also important for&#13;
local government waste managers to have a reasonable knowledge concerning the choice, preparation and good&#13;
management practice of disposal sites. A well illustrated manual on the topic which must also include case&#13;
studies covering different kinds of sites will be prepared and widely distributed.&#13;
19.    Manainng Construction Impacts. These impacts need not be serious or last long, but a number of&#13;
measures can be taken to ensure that they are minimized: (a) construction contractors should cooperate closely&#13;
with police to agree on what work should be carried out and when, and how the traffic will be managed ii so far&#13;
as road works are involved; (b) contractors should coordinate closely with other infrastructure agencies; (c)&#13;
contractors should maintain work force discipline such that no nuisance is created; (d) measures should be taken&#13;
to minimize any dust or mud and noise; (e) basic safety measures should be taken, including the training of the&#13;
workforce; (f) work should be started only when all materials and resources are at hand, and minimal materials&#13;
should be stored on site. These measures are generally already written into contracts for work on urban&#13;
infrastructure. The onus is on the supervising contracting authorities to ensure that good site management is&#13;
practiced.&#13;
20.    Managing Transport Impacts and Improving Accessibility. The towns in this program are not yet&#13;
suffering from significant problems relating to traffic, and the few instances of congestion mainly around bus&#13;
terminals can be eliminated with relatively simple traffic management measures.&#13;
21.    Market Improvements. Strong measures have to be taken to improve the management of markets. The&#13;
following steps should be taken: (a) a new regime for market infrastructure development and management in&#13;
wide consultation with market vendors, customers and managers should be developed; (b) a manual for market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
90&#13;
ANNEX 16&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
design and construction should be produced; and (c) a training program should be developed and instituted for&#13;
local government staff.&#13;
22.    Parks and Gardens. Most local governments do spend money on parks and gardens and some towns&#13;
have requested the inclusion of browsers for watering trees and street greenery in the framework of the solid&#13;
waste management section of their PJM. Recommendations for improvement include tapping the resources of&#13;
the communities and supporting parks department both to institute planting programs and to ensure that planting&#13;
is well maintained.&#13;
23.   Improved Management of Subregional Resources and Sustainable Development. In the hinterland of&#13;
towns, which are suffering the threat of landslides, an active program of erosion control should be undertaken.&#13;
This program would consider: (a) good soil management practices by farmers and estate managers; (b) planting&#13;
for soil stabilization in areas subject to erosion; (c) infrastructure and housing development on slopes of easily&#13;
eroded soils should be designed and built with the problem in mind; (d) quarrying, mining or other extraction&#13;
should minimize erosion impacts; (e) illegal developments on unstable slopes or those which encourage erosion&#13;
should be removed.&#13;
24.   In addition to these elements, the effective confinement of solid waste to one well prepared and managed&#13;
TPA site is important. The need for a more coherent and coordinated inventory and strategy for allocating and&#13;
using subregional water resources is apparent. The protection of forest and nature reserves for the protection of&#13;
water sources is noted. The haphazard and increasingly dispersed development of the towns in the program is&#13;
arguably the most serious regional resource problem facing the urban subregions. The root cause is overpriced&#13;
suburban land with poor planning machinery to "unlock"and reorganize land uses in these areas, coupled with&#13;
cheap transport to more distant and cheaper land. More serious attention needs to be given to this in the&#13;
planning and development of the towns in the program. This issue should become a major focus for strategic&#13;
planning for the kabupatens.&#13;
IV. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
A. Procedural Issues&#13;
25.   An attempt has been made to integrate environmental and social concems into the investment programs.&#13;
The approach was to look not only at the environmental and social process more generally to see what problems&#13;
need to be addressed. But there will remain residual problems and unless the investments are managed within a&#13;
more coherent environmental and social management framework, they are liable to be suboptimal in their&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
26.   If public consultation is undertaken on a program-wide basis, this incorporation of users into the&#13;
decision-making process can be expected to begin to overcome the fragmentation of programs. An effective&#13;
consultation process should be a cooperative enterprise among agencies, resulting in better integration of&#13;
government programs. These main principles are:&#13;
(a) more consideration needs to be given to communicating with the public in identifying priorities for&#13;
infrastructure investments;&#13;
(b) the aim should be to work toward consensus in the investments and a cooperative approach to their&#13;
management;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
91&#13;
ANNEX 16&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
(c) public information and training, and where appropriate, community self-management of programs,&#13;
should be pursued; and&#13;
(d) local government agencies should cooperate in organizing public consultation exercises.&#13;
B. Institutional Recommendations&#13;
27.    Conceming environmental and social monitoring and management as a whole, a number of&#13;
recommendations are made. The law creating the national environmental protection agency (BAPEDAL)&#13;
referred to the creation of provincial agencies. A new law should see that these provincial level agencies are&#13;
established, first in the offices of the provincial governors, then in the kabupatens, starting in the spring or&#13;
summer of 1996. Regional offices (BAPEDAL-Wilaya) are in the process of being established, with Sulawesi&#13;
covered by the East Indonesia office in Ujung Pandang. This structure of environmental management should&#13;
ensure that the environmental programs are implemented, but it is likely that BAPPEDA Tk II will have to fill&#13;
this gap in the interim.&#13;
28.    Specific institutional recommendations for solid waste management specify that where no formal waste&#13;
management agency exists, one should be established and it should be provided with adequate resources. New&#13;
arrangements to introduce a formal program for waste reduction and recycling of materials should be&#13;
implemented. Local govemments, together with community organizations such as the women's organization&#13;
PKK, should initiate composting arrangements. BAPPEDA Tk II needs to become involved.&#13;
29.    Drainage. The provision of adequate drainage and the clearing of blocked drains need to be addressed&#13;
urgently. Although more funding for O&amp;M might be appropriate, encouragement and censure need to be&#13;
instituted to ensure that the work is carried out. The induction of local institutions (Kelurahan, LKD and RW)&#13;
where appropriate would be desirable.&#13;
30.    Market Planning and Management. The institutional structure in place seems inadequate where the&#13;
condition of markets is almost universally unsanitary and poorly managed. There is an urgent need for greater&#13;
consultation conceming the location and planning of market arrangements. This situation implies the need to&#13;
establish standing committees on market planning and management.&#13;
C. Initiatives in Education and Training&#13;
31.   The Ministry of Health has pioneered public education and training and has a lot of experience at all&#13;
government levels from the big cities through small towns into the rural areas. The initiative which is&#13;
recommended here is to apply a much more integrated approach to education, training and consultation. There&#13;
are four main areas in which such training exercises are recommended.&#13;
32.    Sanitation. This is seen as an umbrella concept under which all four areas are gathered. This is in part&#13;
because the main environmental problems in the towns all relate to sanitation, be it from unsatisfactory human&#13;
waste management, flooding, poor solid waste management, or the condition of the markets. The sanitation&#13;
campaigns already undervay form  a good foundation on which to build a more substantial training and&#13;
consultative process. These training sessions should include workshops for the staff of all the departments and&#13;
community representatives concemed, and as well as for community groups.&#13;
33.    Drainage. The focus of training around the problem of poor drainage must be predominantly concemed&#13;
with mechanisms for ensuring that drains are kept clear.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
92&#13;
ANNEX 16&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
34.    Solid Waste Management. Training workshops need to bc held in which the responsible local officials&#13;
and community representatives receive instruction and agree on roles to achieve an effective collection service.&#13;
Manuals and training materials for this need to be produced and motivation raised. The courses for local waste&#13;
disposal staff should be implemented in the context of this program.&#13;
35.    Markets. Two aspects of market organization require urgent attention. On the one hand, the planning&#13;
and reconstruction of markets under way in many of the towns requires more consideration of the needs of all&#13;
market users. On the other hand, the day-to-day running of the wet markets to achieve and sustain the&#13;
maintenance of sanitary conditions requires serious attention. A group of training modules for the staff of Dinas&#13;
Pasar also needs to be attended by staff of other departments. These modules should cover all aspects of the&#13;
management, keeping drains clean and managing solid waste. It is also suggested that the continued good&#13;
management of the market, which concems both economic and sanitation issues, would best be guaranteed by&#13;
the establishment of a Market Forum that would bring together representatives of the responsible agencies.&#13;

ECONOMIC/FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
1.    General Methodology&#13;
The evaluation criteria are based mainly on the net benefit stream for the economic analysis and on the&#13;
corresponding net revenues for the financial analysis. Internal rates of return (IRR) and Net Present Value&#13;
(NPV) have been included as additional indicators. Sensitivity testing has been undertaken, limited, however, to&#13;
10 percent increases to costs and revenues respectively, but calculated on separate runs. IRR's have been&#13;
calculated without interest, depreciation and inflation, but including replacement costs, where applicable, and&#13;
salvage values.&#13;
Salvage values were generally estimated at 20 percent, representing a generally acceptable rate for the&#13;
mix of short life components (e.g. vehicles) and long life components such as permanent structures.&#13;
Depreciation, where applicable, will be calculated on a simple straight-line formula.&#13;
Economic analysis has been carried out at constant 1996 prices. In order to convert financial into&#13;
economic costs, applying to Drainage sub-programs only, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 has been&#13;
used. Lacking specific information, it is assumed that the SCF chosen will eliminate any economic distortions&#13;
of market prices which may prevail at present (taxes, subsidies). Consequently, it is believed that economic&#13;
prices will thus best reflect the real value to society of costs and benefits which will result from the proposed&#13;
sub-projects.&#13;
Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, resulting from the implementation of the individual sub-&#13;
programs, have not been taken from the PJM where they are shown in absolute terms. They have instead been&#13;
based on standard percentage rates according to general experiences in the different sectors. Besides, uniform&#13;
O&amp;M rates offer the advantage of allowing a more reliable comparison of the outcome of sub-programs of&#13;
individual cities. The applied rates are as follows:&#13;
*  Water supply:     15.0 percent     (an optimistic assumption as performance of Sulawesi PDAMs&#13;
indicate a range of 12% to 25%)&#13;
*  Solid wvaste      15.0 percent&#13;
*  Bus terminals      2.0 percent&#13;
*  all sectors        2.5 percent&#13;
Since the determination of revenues (for financial analysis) and benefits (for economic analysis) vary&#13;
considerably according to the character of the sub-sector concerned, corresponding methods applied have been&#13;
described individually for specific sub-programs.&#13;
Summary Tables showing the evaluation results have been prepared, and the Evaluation Tables for each&#13;
town and per sector have been attached in the Annexes to the Report on Economic and Financial Analysis of&#13;
Subprojects which is in the Project File.&#13;

ANNEX 18&#13;

2.     Water Supply&#13;
Basic Considerations&#13;
Extensions to the existing water production capacity and extension of the water distribution system in&#13;
operation, form a major component of the proposed development program in almost all towns evaluated.&#13;
A key problem of the planned investment programs is that the proposals usually involve a mixture of&#13;
changes and improvements to the current services. Extensions to the network together with an enlarged&#13;
production capacity are regularly combined with rehabilitation of weak or non-operational components of the&#13;
existing system, including all water-loss reduction schemes and reconnection of shut-off connections, where&#13;
applicable.&#13;
The number of persons per connection in Year One is assumed to be seven, allowing for some shared&#13;
consumption by neighbors. The figure is gradually reduced in future years to allow for expected reductions in&#13;
average household size. It is assumed that the average per capita consumption (ranging from 100-120 VcJd) will&#13;
remain constant over the planning period since any tendency for consumption to rise with general increase in&#13;
incomes is balanced by the well-known fact that new PDAM customers will have significantly lower incomes&#13;
than existing customers. Consumption from non-domestic connections and public hydrants is taken as 1,000&#13;
liters/day.&#13;
Water losses will correspond to losses currently experienced by individual PDAM.  However, a&#13;
standard rate of 30% has been targeted as future value to be retained in the analysis. Exception will be made&#13;
where actual water losses are already below 30%. For those towns Bulukumba (24.8%), Palopo (27.8%), and&#13;
Sinjai (21.3%) a minimum improvement has still been assumed.&#13;
For the financial analysis of those programs exceeding investments of Rp 4,000 million, the FINPRO&#13;
model has been used for a detailed analysis which will be found on the Project File.&#13;
Results&#13;
Only some ten programs out of about 35 water supply investment programs examined are economically&#13;
justified if the sole criteria of an intemal rate of return (FIRR) of 12% is used. In view of the above results, it&#13;
was agreed that in addition, technically sound programs based on a least-cost-solution, actual demand and&#13;
increased service levels required by the beneficiaries, should also be eligible for inclusion.&#13;
Management, especially financial, and operations appear to be the critical elements for viable water&#13;
enterprises operations as can be seen from the table below:&#13;
Indicator         Unit        Lowest Value         Highest Value       Average&#13;
Population served    % town    12.5  Bantaeng           73.0  Manado          45.5&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
97&#13;
ANNEX 18&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
At least the first three of above indicators point in the direction of unsatisfactory relations with&#13;
customers, otherwise a key element for successful cost recovery policies, and rather poor management capacities&#13;
of some of the PDAM staff. Additionally, institutional weaknesses have been noted in form of overstaffing. A&#13;
ratio of twenty employees or more per 1,000 connections, which does not seem to be the exception in many&#13;
PDAM in Sulawesi, will negatively impact the financial success of any PDAM. Well organized enterprises&#13;
guarantee efficient services with a ratio of ten or less employees per 1,000 connections.&#13;
Taking the above considerations into account, the approach to examine the new investment programs&#13;
for water supply on their own, has been revised and the investment has been tested as to its impact if combined&#13;
with the existing situation prevailing in each PDAM. This may be the more logical approach since significant&#13;
portions of the new investment programs are to be used for rehabilitation purposes and service improvements&#13;
with little impact on extra recurrent costs, but greater impacts on revenue generation (e.g. re-connection of shut-&#13;
off connections). As a direct result, ten additional programs (Barru, Bulukumba, Enrekang, Maros. Palopo,&#13;
Pangkep, Sinjai, Watampone, Poso and Kendari) became acceptable in financial/economic terms. Emphasis&#13;
will be put on management, institutional and operations improvements.&#13;
All analyses have been based on the tariffs and billing rates currently applied by the corresponding&#13;
PDAMs. Thus a great variety of charge rates for water have been used, ranging from 72 Rp/m3 (Sinjai) to 691&#13;
Rp/m3 (Maros), with the average being 309 Rp/m3 (which has been used where corresponding information was&#13;
lacking). Furthermore, the charge rates have been increased by generally 20-50% (up to 100% in some cases)&#13;
in two equal steps in Year Two and Year Four of project implementation where this was required to reach the&#13;
desired outcome. Lower increases have been accepted where the outcome was more promising.&#13;
3.     Drainage&#13;
The overwhelming majority of drainage subprojects are very small, i.e. cost less than Rp 500 million&#13;
(about $0.2 million). Case by case economic analysis (i.e. calculation of EIRR and NPV) is required only for&#13;
the larger ones which typically cost Rp 600 million to Rp 3 billion. The benefits of these drainage subprojects&#13;
are estimated on the basis of land value increases due to reduced flooding. The advantage of this approach is&#13;
obvious: land value increase, if land markets function properly, is an indicator which can reflect the present&#13;
value of the future benefit stream accruing to the owners of the land in the project area. The projected increases&#13;
in land values are based on comparison of land values in the project area to land values in similar, but less&#13;
frequently flooded neighborhoods.  Information on land values for the subprojects was collected during&#13;
interviews with kelurahan (sub-district) staff handling land transactions and with informal real estate brokers.&#13;
