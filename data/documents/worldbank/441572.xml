Preemptive Rights and Privatization&#13;
OlivierFr6mond      Many governments have concluded joint ventures with private investors that contain preemptive&#13;
andJohn Nellis      rights contractually restricting the rights to transfer ownership of a company's securities. The&#13;
privatization of these joint ventures often places governments in an awkward situation. Now&#13;
wishing to sell some or all of their shares, they find themselves caught between the desire to&#13;
divest at a good price, or at least a politically defensible one, and the need to comply with the&#13;
contracts they have signed. What can they do? Depending on the amount of preemptive rights in&#13;
the privatization portfolio, governments can adopt either a case-by-case approach or a more&#13;
comprehensive solution. This Note sets out the options.&#13;

Preemptive Rights and Privatization&#13;
When preemptive rights exist a shareholder must otify the board of&#13;
directors of its intention to sell all or part of its stake in the company to a&#13;
third party, whether an insider or an outsider. The board then informs the&#13;
existingyshareholders of the opportunity to buy those shares.          ticularly well tested-is that underpricing fa-&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Many governments have concluded joint
            ventures with private investors that contain preemptive
            rights contractually restricting the rights to transfer
            ownership of a company's securities. The privatization
            of these joint ventures often places governments in an
            awkward situation. Now wishing to sell some or all of their
            shares, they find themselves caught between the desire to
            divest a good price, or at least a politically defensible
            one, and the need to comply with the contracts they have
            signed. What can they do? Depending on the amount of
            preemptive rights in the privatization portfolio,
            governments can adopt either a case-by-case approach or a
            more comprehensive solution. This Note sets out the options.
