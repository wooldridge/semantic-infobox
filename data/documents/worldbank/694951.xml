STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION 1 PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Sri  Lanka has a rich and varied natural resource base, a basic network of economic&#13;
infrastructure and one of the best sets of social indicators in the developing world with an adult literacy&#13;
rate of almost 90%. With these assets, Sri Lanka has the potential to match the economic performance of&#13;
the newly industrialized countries (NICs) of East Asia. In 1989, the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL)&#13;
reformed its economic policies. These reforms have led to a significant improvement in economic&#13;
performance, a surge in private sector investment, and rapid growth in labor-intensive manufactured&#13;
exports. As industrialization and tourism move forward, it is important that Sri Lanka takes measures to&#13;
ensure that further growth would not be gained at the expense of the environment or that environmental&#13;
problems do not hinder the achievement of growth targets. There is a particular need for policy and&#13;
institutional changes to promote efficient and more sustainable economic growth that explicitly takes&#13;
environmental factors into consideration. The proposed project is designed to help GOSL meet this need.&#13;
1.2    GOSL has taken initial steps to address environmental issues. On the institutional front, it&#13;
established the Central Environment Authority (CEA) under the National Environmental Act (the Act) in&#13;
1980. The Act gives a policy mandate to CEA, and in 1990 it also established the Environment Division&#13;
(ED) within the then Ministry of Environment and Parliamentary Affairs (MEPA) as the focal entity for&#13;
environmental policy, a role yet to be effectively assumed. Sri Lanka was also one of the first developing&#13;
countries to prepare a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP 1992-96). This was updated in 1994&#13;
(NEAP 1995-98) (paras. 2.32-2.35).  Finally,  GOSL is now drafting   new legislation, more&#13;
comprehensive in scope, in order to place the environment even higher on the national agenda. Despite&#13;
these initial steps, Sri Lanka remains confronted by serious environmental problems. Chief among these&#13;
are land degradation and the continuous threat to forest and other vulnerable ecosystems from shifting&#13;
cultivation, as well as air, water, and soil pollution caused by industrialization and tourism. Several donor&#13;
agencies, including the Bank, have been assisting GOSL in tackling some of these problems.&#13;
1.3    GOSL, in collaboration with the Bank and with financial support from the Royal Norwegian&#13;
Government, identified and prepared the Environmental Action 1 Project (EA1P). The Bank, while&#13;
acting as executing agency of a Project Preparation Trust Fund, engaged a consultant team that produced&#13;
the project preparation report (Sri Lanka Environmental Action 1 Project Preparation Report, July 1,&#13;
1994). This staff appraisal report is based on the preparation report and on the updated NEAP. The&#13;
proposed project is the first phase of a long-term effort to assist GOSL in environmental management.&#13;
Thc emphasis in this first phase is on strengthening the institutional and policy framework for&#13;
environmental management within which the Bank and other donors would provide assistance in the&#13;
environmental sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
2. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT&#13;
A.      ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES AND ISSUES&#13;
2.1    The following paragraphs give an overview of Sri Lanka's natural resource base and the nature&#13;
of environmental problems in each area:&#13;
2.2    Land Resources. Of Sri Lanka's 6.5 million ha, 2.2 million ha are under permanent cultivation&#13;
and 1.1 million ha are under shifting (chena) cultivation. About 73% of cultivated land is under&#13;
smallholdings. The major agricultural systems include irrigated croplands of rice and other food crops for&#13;
domestic consumption, mainly centered on 12,000 small anicuts or village tanks in the dry zone;&#13;
comparatively recent large-scale irrigation development projects, the largest of which are on the Mahaweli&#13;
River; about 800,000 ha of large, but declining, privately-owned, export-oriented tree crop plantations on&#13;
the 30-60° slopes of the central hill country; and chena cultivation practiced by 250,000 families. Of the&#13;
total irrigated area, 235,000 ha consists of minor schemes (&lt;80 ha), 255,000 ha of medium schemes (80-&#13;
600 ha), and 45,000 ha of major schemes (&gt;600 ha). Closed canopy of natural forests covers 1.33 million&#13;
ha or 20.2% of the land area. This represents a rapid decline from 44% cover in 1956 and 70-80% in&#13;
1900. Over 95% of the forests are state-owned.&#13;
2.3    Land degradation is perhaps the most critical environmental problem affecting Sri Lanka's future&#13;
development. It includes both the degradation of soils through sheet and gully erosion and declining&#13;
structure and fertility, and degradation of vegetation through deforestation, shifting cultivation, and&#13;
overuse. The two problems are interrelated and are mostly due to policy failures such as the lack of long-&#13;
term leases of state-owned land to farmers and the absence of transferable farmer user rights both of&#13;
which discourage spontaneous investments in sustainable production and contribute to land degradation.&#13;
Soil erosion leads not only to crop losses but also to negative impacts on hydropower dams and reservoirs,&#13;
irrigation and water supply infrastructure, and fisheries. Recent studies show that soil erosion in the mid-&#13;
country is more than 100 tons/ha per annum. The most severe erosion occurs in tobacco lands and&#13;
neglected tea lands of smallholders. Some reports indicate over 300-400 tons/ha/year soil loss on such&#13;
lands. In the dry and intermediate zones, more than a million ha are subjected to shifting cultivation that&#13;
remains one of the principal activities of the majority of the population. Shifting cultivation depletes soil&#13;
fertility and causes weed infestation, soil erosion, and decline in crop yields. Sri Lanka has one of the&#13;
highest deforestation rates in the world at 4%. Deforestation has been most severe in the dry zone, and&#13;
species-rich lowland rain forests are limited to less than 10% of the total forest area. Many remaining&#13;
natural forests have been seriously degraded, leading to reduced biodiversity.&#13;
2.4    Until now, GOSL has not paid much attention to tackling land degradation on a holistic and&#13;
comprehensive basis involving a watershed approach. Although some initiatives have started recently on&#13;
an experimental basis, comprehensive strategies and programs to address these issues are several years&#13;
away. On the basis of the experiences and research in Sri Lanka and similar agroecological zones in Asia,&#13;
it is possible to design pilot programs using technologies to address the main degradation problems based&#13;
on the watershed approach. Technologies can be grouped into water and soil conservation technologies&#13;
such as mulching, construction of stone terraces, and the use of vegetative hedges, and biomass enhancing&#13;
technologies such as farm forestry and private or community woodlots. The pilot land management&#13;
component of this project would address the issue of land degradation and test and develop on a watershed&#13;
basis suitable site-specific technologies, taking account of gradient and soil characteristics for minimizing&#13;
the extent of land degradation (paras. 3.19-3.24). The pilot thus would help increase agricultural&#13;
productivity as well as reduce the risk of erosion and its associated on-farm and off-farm impacts.&#13;
2.5     Water Resources.  More than 100 rivers flow in a radial pattern from the island's central&#13;
mountains to the sea. Twelve rivers account for 75% of total river discharge, and about half of this flows&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
through the wet zone. The principal exception is the Mahaweli River, the country's largest, which flows&#13;
in a northeastern direction through the dry zone to the sea. Most of the country's surface water is used for&#13;
irrigation, which is provided to about 68% of the total cultivated land, and electricity generation.&#13;
Hydropower provides 90% of Sri Lanka's current electricity needs, but there is little potential for further&#13;
large-scale hydropower developments (see para. 2.12). Annual renewable water resources amount to&#13;
about 5,600 m3 per capita. Only 15% of this total is used, but of this, the greater part (96%) is consuned&#13;
by agriculture, with 2% used by industry and 2% for domestic purposes. The only area with a water&#13;
surplus is the western wet zone, and the most acute deficit areas are in the northwest and southeast dry&#13;
zones. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting GOSL with preparation of a comprehensive&#13;
water resource management plan and is strengthening institutional capacity in water resource&#13;
management.&#13;
2.6     Groundwater can provide supplementary irrigation in many areas of the dry zone, except the&#13;
northern districts. Groundwater is also increasingly used as source of potable water supplies, especially in&#13;
small towns and rural areas. Similarly, larger urban areas and industrial enterprises are growing users of&#13;
this water source. Available data show, however, that this development is occurring without considering&#13;
the resource availability, its renewability, and effects of exploitation on the local ecology.&#13;
2.7    The emerging problems relating to water include soil salinity and water logging, deterioration of&#13;
water quality, emergence of health issues, and depletion of ground water resources. Soil salinity and&#13;
water logging are major concerns in recently developed irrigation projects where drainage of irrigated&#13;
lands receives insufficient attention. More than one-third of the population is using unprotected wells,&#13;
rivers, and tanks and does not have access to safe drinking water. Thus, the incidence of water-related&#13;
illnesses is very high. The greatest threat to the groundwater supply is in the Jaffna Peninsula, which is&#13;
dependent on this source for agriculture and human consumption. Groundwater is obtained from caverns&#13;
that are usually connected to the sea, so that fresh water is confined to the top portion. A good part of the&#13;
fresh water used for agriculture goes back into these groundwater reservoirs. Therefore, fertilizers and&#13;
pesticides can pollute this supply. Investigations have already shown considerable aquifer contamination&#13;
by nitrates, especially in the Kalpitiya and the Jaffna Peninsula.&#13;
2.8     Wildlife and Biodiversity. Sri Lanka's biological diversity is of global significance, and it has&#13;
greater biodiversity per unit area than any other country in Asia. Its wildlife includes 628 known species&#13;
of terrestrial vertebrates, 84 species of mammals, 379 birds, 32 amphibians, 133 reptiles, and at least 59&#13;
species of freshwater fish. Most of the endemic (unique) animal and plant species inhabit the rain forests&#13;
of the wet zone. Although over 12% of the land has been set aside for conservation in an extensive system&#13;
of protected areas, most of the relatively large reserves are in the dry zone and not in the wet southwest&#13;
region where plant and animal diversity and endemism are most significant. Biodiversity is under threat&#13;
in Sri Lanka primarily from the progressive reduction in its natural forests and other ecosystems such as&#13;
the wetlands and the mangroves and the selective exploitation of species (particularly for timber). Several&#13;
donor agencies such as the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), the United&#13;
States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Netherlands, and the United Nations&#13;
Development Program/Food and Agricultural Organization (UNDP/FAO) are assisting GOSL in a&#13;
number of biodiversity/wildlife conservation projects, including wetlands.&#13;
2.9     Coastal and Marine Resources. Several hundred miles of coral reefs; 120,000 ha of brackish&#13;
water lagoons, estuaries, and mangrove swamps; and about 140,000 ha of freshwater tanks and reservoirs&#13;
provide the basis for productive marine and inshore fisheries. The vast majority of the fish catch (85%)&#13;
comes from marine sources-about 183,000 tons annually. Although fishing contributes only 2% of&#13;
GDP, fish is the major source of animal protein in the Sri Lankan diet and fishing supports about 500,000&#13;
people. The coastal environment, however, is being seriously degraded by various forms of pollution, silt&#13;
deposition, erosion compounded by sand and coral mining, conversion to tourist facilities, and the loss of&#13;
mangroves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.&#13;
2.10    The key environmental issues in the coastal zones are loss of habitats and nursery grounds;&#13;
overexploitation of coastal resources including fish, sand, and coral limestone; and marine pollution&#13;
causing, inter alia, reduced growth rates for coral reefs and other living organisms in the marine&#13;
environment, health hazards for recreational users of polluted waters, and reduced fish production. The&#13;
prognosis for the condition of the coastal environment in Sri Lanka by the end of the century is bleak if&#13;
the current trends of environmental deterioration continue at the present rates.&#13;
2.11    Urban and Industrial Pollution.  Urbanization and industrialization have occurred virtually&#13;
without enforcement of regulatory measures. Unregulated industries have exploited underpriced air,&#13;
water, and land; and unchecked urbanization has spread haphazardly, outstripping adequate&#13;
infrastructure. Pollution of the urban and industrial sectors has an impact on the aquatic environment.&#13;
Sri Lanka also faces enormous problems with the special requirements for the disposal of hospital,&#13;
industrial, and other forms of toxic waste, much of which is expected to increase with continued economic&#13;
development. Because of the low level of treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater, the receiving&#13;
waters are considerably polluted. The Kelani River receives untreated effluent from 21 industries and&#13;
untreated sewage of 1.6 million people living in metropolitan areas. The Colombo Environmental&#13;
Improvement Project (CEIP) addresses this issue and includes an industrial liquid waste component and a&#13;
clean settlement program.'  Remedial measures to these problems are also taken under the Bank-&#13;
supported Metropolitan Environmental Improvement Program (MEIP), and pollution reduction projects&#13;
supported by USAID, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and the Netherlands&#13;
government.&#13;
2.12    Energy Sources.   The primary energy sources in Sri Lanka include biomass (72%),&#13;
hydroelectricity (10%), and petroleum (18%). Up to now, Sri Lanka has suffered little environmental&#13;
damage from energy production and use. Hydro electricity dominates the present power system, and the&#13;
principal environmental issue that the power sector has had to deal with in the past has been the&#13;
relocation and resettlement of people displaced by reservoirs. This is changing as the system gradually&#13;
shifts toward an increasing number of thermal plants. A case study of Sri Lanka2 provides an assessment&#13;
of a wide range of policy options, including representative demand-side management measures, renewable&#13;
energy options (such as wind power), and clean coal technologies. The case study is the beginning of a&#13;
long-term effort to integrate environmental considerations into energy sector planning in Sri Lanka. The&#13;
Study of Linkages Between Macroeconomic Policies and the Environment in Sri Lanka complements the&#13;
above assessment (para. 2.36).&#13;
2.13    Mineral Resources. Sri Lanka is well endowed with mineral resources. The country's most&#13;
important minerals are gems that account for about 5% of export earnings. The mining industry can be&#13;
broadly classified into two categories: artisanal mining and large-scale organized mechanized mining.&#13;
Gem mining contributes to land degradation, especially in selected localities. The general environmental&#13;
issues associated with the mining industry include destruction of the vegetative cover and loss of&#13;
agricultural production, increased occurrence and intensity of floods, increased incidence of vector-borne&#13;
diseases, and increased coastal erosion.&#13;
B.      MARKET AND POLICY FAILURES&#13;
2.14    Market and policy failures result in natural resources not being costed at their true value, thus&#13;
leading to their inefficient allocation and use and their subsequent degradation. This is true in many&#13;
developing countries including Sri Lanka, where several conditions for the efficient functioning of&#13;
markets are lacking, and many natural resource services function outside the marketplace. There is often&#13;
a wide divergence between the private and social costs of using natural resources. When farmers crop&#13;

marginal land, besides falling productivity of the site, it may also cause externalities or costs downstream&#13;
or over time. For example, increased water run off from the cropped land or over grazed pasture would&#13;
cause erosion and increased silting of downstream reservoirs, as well as increased flooding and&#13;
agricultural and urban damage. Again, the market does not put a value on the environmental services of&#13;
woodlands, and decisions to cut trees are made without considering the value of these important&#13;
environmental services. The negative externalities resulting from  activities such as  deforestation,&#13;
rangeland degradation, siltation of reservoirs, loss of wildlife habitats, and hydrological imbalance due to&#13;
the activities of peoples in and around their farms underscore the need for government intervention based&#13;
on a sustainable resource management strategy. Policies should be put in place to reflect the true&#13;
opportunity costs of the resource base.  Such intervention should take the form  of providing&#13;
incentives/disincentives for adoption of sustainable resource management techniques in achieving&#13;
increased productivity of resources, education, training, and advice on sustainable and environmentally&#13;
sound resource management techniques and practices to raise incomes.&#13;
2.15    Policy studies undertaken during project preparation identified the range of economy-wide and&#13;
sectoral policies that have a negative impact (direct or indirect) on the environment and concluded that&#13;
most of the causes of priority environmental problems can be attributed, in part, to the existing structure&#13;
of incentives/disincentives (see Annex 8). Based on the findings of the studies, a policy reform agenda&#13;
conducive to sound environmental management was formulated and included in the updated NEAP (para.&#13;
2.32). The wide range of policy issues covered by Sri Lanka's NEAP could be grouped into: (i) issues&#13;
related to environmental institutions (e.g., current government policies do not include a clear&#13;
determination of public/private sector roles in environmental management); and (ii) issues that underlie&#13;
the incentive structure leading to specific environmental problems. The latter issues are, in general, of a&#13;
sectoral or a microeconomic nature and are generally caused by the underpricing of natural resources with&#13;
respect to access (leading mainly to agricultural land degradation, deforestation, over fishing, and over&#13;
mining) or services (leading to pollution by untreated waste disposal, etc.). In some areas, however,&#13;
analyses are needed to define the exact linkages between the sector and economy-wide policies and the&#13;
environment (para. 2.36). As important as timely action to address these issues is the need to develop and&#13;
maintain a capacity for establishing linkages between economic policy and the environment. As a follow&#13;
up to the above policy studies, a Policy Letter was submitted to IDA on September 1, 1995, and an Action&#13;
Plan that identifies major environmental policy actions was discussed with GOSL as part of the project&#13;
(para. 3.13).&#13;
C.     INSTITUTIONAL FAILURES&#13;
2.16    Most national environmental strategies and action plans identify institutional weaknesses as a&#13;
vital factor contributing to the perpetuation of environmental degradation. This is certainly true in Sri&#13;
Lanka where unclear definition of institutional responsibilities and weak implementation capacity have&#13;
led to weak environmental management. Project preparatory work revealed that policy formulation,&#13;
program implementation, enforcement and monitoring are not effectively performed by the various&#13;
government institutions (paras. 2.19-2.29). There is a lack of clarity of mandates and coordination&#13;
mechanisms amongst government entities as well as a shortage of well-trained environmental staff in the&#13;
Ministry of Transport, Environment and Women's Affairs' (MTEWA) ED, CEA, and other line and local&#13;
entities. One reason for the confusion has been the changing mandates of CEA with regard to policy&#13;
formulation. While the proposed new environmental legislation would clarify these roles, assistance would&#13;
be needed to ensure that the new institutional set-up is effective. The shortage of adequate staff resources&#13;
is exacerbated by a high rate of staff turnover and difficulty in filling vacancies with well-trained and&#13;
experienced staff due, inter alia, to relatively low salary scales for technical staff. CEA does not have the&#13;
human and financial resources to effectively carry out Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), industrial&#13;
licensing and inspection, small industries regulation, and response to pollution emergencies and&#13;
enforcement. The project would strengthen MTEWA to assist development of policy and monitoring&#13;
capabilities and mandate the regular updating of the NEAP, and to steer natural resource management&#13;
policy and planning and coordination among all agencies (paras. 3.5-3.11). To complement the activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
under this project, other donor agencies are currently planning to assist in strengthening the&#13;
environmental management capacities of the line Ministries and provincial government institutions.&#13;
2.17   There has also been limited community involvement in the management of natural resources in&#13;
Sri Lanka. The experience and lessons learned from other developing countries is that the 'top down&#13;
approach" should be replaced by community-based institutional structures that not only fill the&#13;
institutional vacuum but also cover part of the operational costs. This means identifying and promoting&#13;
the use of environmental resources, in a manner that is not only sustainable, but that provides adequate&#13;
financial returns to the users, thereby minimizing conflicts between growth and conservation objectives.&#13;
The proposed Community Environmental Initiatives Facility (CEIF) is designed so that local needs,&#13;
priorities, and capabilities are taken into consideration, and the local communities/non-governmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs) are given full implementation responsibilities to ensure sustainable use of&#13;
environmental resources (para. 3.15).&#13;
D.     INADEQUATE PUBLIC AWARENESS. MONITORING. AND COMMITMENT&#13;
2.18   Other factors that have contributed to environmental degradation in Sri Lanka are a lack of&#13;
information, inadequate public awareness about environmental problems and their causes, and insufficient&#13;
political will to address the problems. The public needs to be made aware that environmental degradation&#13;
can threaten growth itself and its costs to society in the long run could be extremely high. Public&#13;
awareness needs to be increased through mass media and education if sustainable and economically&#13;
efficient use of land resources is to be practiced by the community. Mass education is also necessary if&#13;
community participation is to play a greater role in resource management. Not only are general education&#13;
and communication programs lacking in Sri Lanka, but specific information and data on the status of the&#13;
environment in Sri Lanka are fragmented and inadequate. Institutional communication within Ministries&#13;
is minimal. The need to establish an effective environmental information system, by setting up a network&#13;
of information exchange, has been strongly expressed during the NEAP process. The project would fund&#13;
environmental education and mass awareness programs with emphasis on the local level and the&#13;
development of a national environmental monitoring information system to address this constraint (para.&#13;
3.10).&#13;
E.     ENVIRONMENTAL INSTITUTIONS&#13;
2.19   Two critical ministries from an environmental, multi-sectoral management perspective are the&#13;
large and influential Ministry of Finance and Planning (MFP) and the relatively new MTEWA. Most of&#13;
the line agencies in GOSL take an active role in some aspect of environmental management and,&#13;
therefore, have a say in the implementation of environmental priorities through sectoral action. This&#13;
section presents the main institutions involved in Sri Lanka's environmental management, with particular&#13;
attention given to the multi-sectoral environmental entities.&#13;
Central Policy Setting and Coordination&#13;
2.20   Ministry of Finance and Planning. MFP is responsible for policy formulation in all sectors. This&#13;
includes the review and approval of all development projects, the public investment program, and the&#13;
annual budget. MFP coordinates and monitors environmental programs and donor support for these&#13;
programs through the National Environmental Steering Committee (NESC).&#13;
2.21    Ministry of Transport. Environment and Women's Affairs. MTEWA was established in 1994 as&#13;
a Cabinet Ministry. It includes the 'Environment Division" within the Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Women's Affairs and has authority over CEA. Although both MTEWA and CEA have made considerable&#13;
progress in recent years, MTEWA still lacks the capacity and sectoral recognition to formulate&#13;
environmental policies according to the country's economic development goals and policies. MTEWA&#13;
also lacks the human and financial resources necessary to take a leading and more decisive role in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
environmental conservation and natural resource management in Sri Lanka. Its official strength of 12&#13;
professional positions does not presently provide this capacity, and the present structure of MTEWA is&#13;
inadequate to meet all the needs and challenges related to environmental management and protection.&#13;
Allocation and delineation of authority and responsibilities within MTEWA are not clear, and there is a&#13;
need for a more functional organizational structure.  Furthermore, MTEWA lacks a responsive&#13;
administrative, accounting and information function to serve its own particular needs.&#13;
2.22   National Environmental Steering Committee. NESC was originally established as an ad hoc&#13;
body to coordinate the NEAP. It is responsible for coordinating and monitoring all environmental&#13;
initiatives, including donor assistance programs, and is co-chaired by the Secretaries of MFP and&#13;
MTEWA. But NESC lacks the capacity and experts needed to develop national environmental policies&#13;
and coordinate their implementation. In practice, it has functioned more as a forum for resolving&#13;
operational issues and conflicts.&#13;
2.23    Secretaries' Committee for Environment and Development (SCED). The Cabinet has recently&#13;
appointed a Senior Committee of Secretaries, chaired by the Secretary, MTEWA, to develop a national&#13;
environmental policy.  This committee would work closely with all agencies in preparing an&#13;
environmental policy paper. It is expected to remain as an active committee that would not only address&#13;
ad hoc environmental issues, as was done by NESC, but also address broader policy issues relating to&#13;
economic development.&#13;
Enforcement and Monitoring&#13;
2.24   Central Environmental Authority (CEAl. CEA, established in 1980, was originally the sole&#13;
statutory body with environmental protection responsibility under the Basic Environment Law (#47/1980).&#13;
Constrained by a vague mandate, weak government commitment, limited resources, and lack of specific&#13;
environmental management tools and implementation authority, CEA's accomplishments during the first&#13;
ten years were modest. Amendments to the Basic Environment Law enacted in 1988 designated industrial&#13;
pollution control as CEA's priority mandate and assigned environmental licensing authority to the&#13;
agency. A 1990 regulation equipped CEA with another potentially powerful tool, EIA, and EIA became a&#13;
statutory requirement in 1993. CEA has delegated EIA review and approval responsibilities to 14 Project&#13;
Approving Agencies (PAAs), and it helps these agencies process their EIA reports.&#13;
2.25    CEA has introduced an environmental licensing scheme (EPL) aimed at all polluting industries&#13;
and projects, and helped to establish pollution mitigation regulations (1990) and a statutory requirement&#13;
for EIAs (1993). CEA's other activities have included an inventory of imported chemicals; a review of&#13;
existing legislative measures affecting the environment; environmental awareness programs in schools; an&#13;
environmental volunteer service program; the production of teaching aides and educational materials; the&#13;
establishment of an environmental library; and the presentation of seminars, workshops, radio, and TV&#13;
programs on environmental issues. CEA participates in MEIP, water quality monitoring, air pollution&#13;
monitoring for Colombo, environmental clearance of hotel projects, implementation of the Forestry&#13;
Master Plan. etc. CEA's Legal Unit, with only two officers, is severely understaffed.&#13;
2.26   The broad and growing responsibilities of CEA are not matched by its human and financial&#13;
resources. The inadequacy of existing staff levels (130 total staff positions, of which 51 are managerial,&#13;
professional, or technical positions and the remainder are support positions) would be somewhat relieved&#13;
by the addition of new positions under the project. Approval of the new positions is currently being&#13;
processed by the Government. However, CEA has experienced difficulty in filling vacant posts due to a&#13;
national shortage of appropriately qualified candidates and unattractive compensation levels that are&#13;
inferior to those of comparable state bodies. Recently established donor-supported advanced degree&#13;
programs in environmental disciplines are expected to relieve the shortage of qualified candidates within&#13;
this decade, but the problem of unattractive compensation levels remains. In addition to unattractive&#13;
compensation levels, other weaknesses of the incentive system include heavy weighting of length of&#13;
service vs. merit criteria for promotion, severe wage compression, and desultory external supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
(para. 3.8).  CEA has recently delegated some of its local regulatory functions to the Divisional&#13;
Secretariats (DSs) (para. 2.29). Accelerated economic development, including rapid industrialization, is&#13;
imposing increasing demands on the agency in the role of MTEWA's technical, regulatory, and&#13;
implementing arm. Presently, CEA has no branches outside the capital city. CEA has, however, recently&#13;
obtained GOSL approval to establish four Regional Offices, anticipating that there would eventually be&#13;
one such office in each province.&#13;
2.27    A Corporate Plan prepared in 1991 for the period 1992-96 outlines priority objectives, strategies,&#13;
and action plans for CEA.  This plan proposes staff increases of about 70%, improvements in&#13;
compensation packages, and a reorganization.  Until recently, there has been little progress in&#13;
implementing the Plan's recommendations, despite a 1992 review that identified CEA's long- and short-&#13;
term objectives and priorities. This lack of progress has mainly been due to the high number of vacancies&#13;
in CEA and consequent lack of implementation capacity.&#13;
2.28    While CEA expanded its EIA and licensing programs and gained valuable operational&#13;
experience in these areas after 1990, it failed to articulate a strategic plan, adequately strengthen its&#13;
technical credibility, or achieve visible successes in pollution control. With the shift of the policy-making&#13;
role to MTEWA, CEA now functions more as a technical, executing, and regulatory arm of MTEWA.&#13;
CEA is working closely and more effectively with MTEWA, and proposed new laws would strengthen&#13;
CEA's ability, to carry out its designated role.&#13;
2.29   Provincial &amp; Local Institutions. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution empowered nine&#13;
Provincial Councils (PCs) and 308 DSs with stubstantial administrative responsibilities. Seven PCs with&#13;
Chief Ministers and provincial ministries have been operating since 1989. Under the 1987 Constitution,&#13;
environment is a partially devolved subject, and this permits the PCs to establish a Provincial&#13;
Environmental Authority (PEA).  However, only one province, Northwest Province, has enacted&#13;
provincial environmental legislation and has a small PEA with limited capacity. The lack of involvement&#13;
of the PCs, local authorities, and DSs in environmental management and protection is a shortcoming that&#13;
would need to be addressed. While this first-phase project would not address regional institutional&#13;
strengthening as a priority, it would nevertheless: (i) demonstrate PC involvement in environmental issues&#13;
tlhrough thc pilot land management component (para. 4. 11); (ii) foster local authority involvement&#13;
through the CEIF (para. 3.15); and (iii) coordinate with bilateral external agencies (e.g., Dutch and&#13;
Norwegian assistance) that are involved in regional institutional strengthening.&#13;
2.30    Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Communities. There are reportedly more than&#13;
275 environmental NGOs in Sri Lanka. NGOs have been playing increasingly active roles in areas of&#13;
operational implementation of environmental management as well as advocacy to raise awareness to&#13;
environmental issues at the official and community levels. While most of these organizations are small in&#13;
size and operate at the local level, there is an increasing number of national NGOs, with headquarters in&#13;
Colombo. who receive significant support from external support agencies, mainly the Netherlands,&#13;
Norway, Canada, and the USA. There is general appreciation in Sri Lanka that ED of MTEWA and the&#13;
CEA are leading the rest of governmental agencies in their acceptance of NGO and community&#13;
participation in the planning and implementation of development actions. This effort of GOSL-NGO&#13;
collaboration has facilitated NGO influence in the formulation of the first and second NEAPs and has&#13;
ensured NGO participation in the design of the present project. The project would further develop&#13;
participation in overall environmental management by (i) formalizing NGO participation as a priority&#13;
program of MTEWA (para. 3.5); (ii) including NGOs in the overall program of training and human&#13;
resources development pursued by the project (para. 3.12); and (iii) promoting NGO implementation of&#13;
environmental activities through the CEIF component (para. 3.16) and the pilot land management&#13;
component (para. 4.11).&#13;
2.31    The Private Sector. To date, private sector participation in environmental management has been&#13;
slower than NGO participation. While GOSL's stated policy is to encourage private-public partnerships&#13;
in addressing environmental concerns, the actual mechanisms and significant benefits of such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
partnerships are still to be demonstrated. For obvious reasons of long-term sustainability, the present&#13;
project would not provide direct assistance to the private sector. However, the project would indirectly&#13;
promote the role of the private sector through support to the contracting out of activities that are now done&#13;
by the public sector (paras. 3.7, 3.8), policy action (para. 3.13),  and inclusion of private-public&#13;
partnerships initiatives under the CEIF component (para. 3.16).&#13;
The National Environmental Action Plan&#13;
2.32    Sri Lanka became one of the first developing countries to elaborate, with IDA assistance, a&#13;
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP 1992-1996) in 1991. The NEAP included the major findings&#13;
and recommendations of the National Conservation Strategy, the National Report to the United Nations&#13;
Conference for Environment &amp; Development (UNCED) and the World Bank-supported Environmental&#13;
Action Plan of 1991. The plan is being carried out with the active support of the donor community and&#13;
NGOs. The original plan was, however, a preliminary framework that defined the broad objectives, and&#13;
priorities for environmental policies and programs. It fell short of making a critical assessment of the&#13;
interaction between economic policies and environmental issues. GOSL felt that far more should and&#13;
could be done to better incorporate sound environment management into the economic development&#13;
process and that enough had changed since 1991 to warrant updating the NEAP. For these reasons, and&#13;
as part of the preparation activities of the present project, GOSL updated the NEAP in 1994. The updated&#13;
NEAP3 covers the period 1995-1998. Perhaps the single most significant aspect of the first revision of&#13;
the NEAP is to attempt to articulate the relationships between the country's broad-based economic&#13;
development strategies and the steps necessary to ensure environmentally sound development.&#13;
2.33    Three important premises were given to this effort. First, the updated NEAP has been developed&#13;
with a highly participatory and collaborative process. Second, it is intended to be a 'living" document,&#13;
which can be further updated and built upon in the future. Third, it provides a dynamic environmental&#13;
policy foundation to obtain further financial support for programs designed to assist Sri Lanka's efforts to&#13;
achieve environmentally sustainable development.&#13;
2.34   The updated NEAP.  The updated NEAP provides a framework for interventions deemed&#13;
necessary to safeguard the environment. It consists of six program areas: (i) strengthening institutions to&#13;
coordinate environmental activities, developing policies and legislation and enforcing regulations;&#13;
(ii) managing land and water resources; (iii) protecting forest and biodiversity; (iv) managing urban and&#13;
industrial pollution; (v) protecting coastal and marine resources; and (vi) managing energy and mineral&#13;
resources. The updated NEAP sets the stage for regular updating exercises to ensure that Sri Lanka&#13;
follows a sustainable economic development path.&#13;
2.35    The updated NEAP has, however, several shortcomings. First, it has a short-term horizon.&#13;
Second, it comprises several programs that are at different levels of maturity, some being merely&#13;
identified, some being adequately prepared and qualified for instant support. Third, the plan falls short of&#13;
defining priority actions within broad categories of problems, identifying appropriate policy instruments,&#13;
and integrating environmental concerns more cost-effectively and consistently across economic sectors.&#13;
Further analyses would be undertaken during the project period to refine some of the linkages and identify&#13;
appropriate policy instruments in each program area (see para. 3.13).&#13;
F.     IDA AND DONOR STRATEGY IN SRI LANKA'S ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
2.36    Country Assistance Strate v. The World Bank Group's country assistance strategy for Sri&#13;
Lanka4  is designed to help Sri Lanka realize its goal of economic growth and poverty reduction&#13;
comparable to that of its more prosperous East Asian neighbors. To support the growth objective, Bank&#13;
Group efforts concentrate on: fiscal restraint, the reduction in losses of public enterprises through&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
l0&#13;
accelerated privatization, the elimination of unproductive subsidies, and the promotion of sustainable&#13;
private-sector led growth. Central to this objective is the need to provide for a conducive institutional and&#13;
policy framework for private investment and for public investment in infrastructure, to help stimulate a&#13;
supply response and the ensure that growth will not be at the expense of the natural environment or the&#13;
quality of urban life. To address the poverty reduction objective, the Bank Group's approach highlights&#13;
creating jobs and raising rural incomes by improving the environment for private sector growth,&#13;
particularly in agriculture. To translate its strategy into action, IDA has taken an increasingly active role&#13;
in the environment as reflected in its sector work and lending (see para. 2.37), and it had a leading role in&#13;
the preparation of the first NEAP. IDA also contributed to the NEAP updating process and supported the&#13;
Study of Linkages Between Macroeconomic Policies and the Environment, which analyzes the linkages&#13;
among a range of economic policies and crucial environment issues related to the Colombo Region, the&#13;
Energy Sector, and the Tree Crop Sector.5   Annex 1 gives the details of project's link to Bank's&#13;
strategies. This project fits into the Bank Group's country assistance strategy as it would strengthen the&#13;
institutional and policy framework for environmental management leading to cost-effective and fiscally&#13;
sustainable increases in selective areas of environmental policy making and enforcement that belong in&#13;
the private sector, while promoting the contracting out of environmental services currently undertaken by&#13;
the public sector. The institutional strengthening component of this project will establish and support&#13;
sustainable mechanisms of coordination between NGOs, public and private sector entities, and external&#13;
donors in addressing policy and investment issues for the promotion of environmental management.&#13;
Also, the project will continue the investigation of economic policy-environment linkages in view of the&#13;
promotion of market-driven interventions for environmental management.&#13;
2.37   The FY89 Forest Sector Development Project aims to improve the forestry sector through&#13;
establishment of an Environmental Management System (para 3.10). The FY93 Second Agricultural&#13;
Extension Project addresses issues of land degradation.  The FY93 Community Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Project represents the beginning of a nationwide program to adopt the community-based&#13;
approach for providing rural water supply and sanitation. The FY94 Colombo Urban Transport Project&#13;
addresses issues of air pollution in Colombo. In the urban sector, MEIP has also completed preparation&#13;
of an Environmental Management Strategy for the Colombo Region. The FY96 Colombo Environment&#13;
Improvement Project (CEIP) supports measures to deal with pollution from both domestic and industrial&#13;
sources. Finally, the FY96 Private Sector Infrastructure Development Project supports private sector&#13;
initiatives in sewage treatment.&#13;
2.38   International Support. Many other bilateral and multilateral agencies and donors are supporting&#13;
environmental protection and resource conservation work in Sri Lanka. The more active and visible&#13;
groups include USAID, ADB, and UNDP. USAID is supporting the Natural Resources &amp; Environmental&#13;
Policy Project (NAREPP) (1991-1997) which addresses basic national environmental policy and&#13;
implementation issues. USAID also supports the Shared Control of Resources Project that responds to&#13;
issues in the land and water resources sector. ADB is supporting the Land Use Policy Planning Project&#13;
which helps build land use policies and plans. UNDP provides financial assistance to the MEIP and is also&#13;
supporting the National Agenda 21, which formulates broad sustainable strategies.&#13;
2.39    At the sectoral level, the most significant environmental programs in Sri Lanka are in forestry&#13;
and urban and industrial development: (a) a succession of large-scale forestry plans and activities funded&#13;
by the Finnish International Development Agency, the Overseas Development Administration, ADB and&#13;
UNDP; (b) a 5-year ADB-financed Participatory Forestry Project, and (c) the ADB-financed Sri Lanka&#13;
Urban Development Project with components in (i) infrastructure development in medium and small&#13;
urban centers, (ii) strengthening urban sector policies, and (iii) training of staff. Donor support,&#13;
however, has been provided in an uncoordinated and piecemeal fashion. Also, despite this support, the&#13;

same period indicate a clear need for additional funding in almost all six areas of emphasis of the NEAP,&#13;
particularly in priority areas of land resources. But more importantly there is a greater need for efficient&#13;
priority setting within a constrained resources environment. It is recognized that the process of protecting&#13;
the environment, reversing damage, and developing and strengthening environmental institutions is a&#13;
process that needs to be nurtured.&#13;
2.40    Lessons From  Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The proposed project integrates the lessons&#13;
learned from environmental projects supported by the Bank/IDA.6 The principal lessons reflected in the&#13;
design of this project include: (a) Institutions: (i) no ideal blueprint exists for environmental institutions,&#13;
but the establishment of formal high-level agencies for setting policies and ensuring enforcement should&#13;
significantly improve environmental management; (ii) strengthening national and subnational&#13;
institutional and technical capabilities for environmental management is of critical importance; and (iii)&#13;
community and NGO participation can play an important role in support of public sector environmental&#13;
institutions; (b) Policies: (i) political support of environmental objectives must be secured; and (ii)&#13;
environmental regulations should be accompanied to the extent possible by economic incentives; and (c)&#13;
Investments: (i) the success of environmental projects is conditioned by adequate institutional capacity and&#13;
technical information and a supportive policy environment; and (ii) donor assistance for investments&#13;
prioritized under environmental strategies and action plans should be coordinated.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.     Project Rationale&#13;
3.]    IDA's role in supporting GOSL to achieve project objectives is in formulating and implementing&#13;
a policy reform agenda, strengthening institutions and coordinating donor activities in the sector. IDA&#13;
has a comparative advantage in these areas and can contribute considerably to increasing coordination&#13;
between donors on key policy and institutional issues. The project would also complement other Bank&#13;
efforts in addressing Sri Lanka's environmental priorities including the Forest Sector Development&#13;
Project, the Colombo Urban Transport Project, and the recent CEIP.&#13;
B.     Project Objectives&#13;
3.2    The primary objective of the proposed project is to assist GOSL in strengthening the institutional&#13;
and policy framework for environmental management within which IDA and other donors would provide&#13;
assistance for improved environmental management. In particular, the project would: (i) support the&#13;
restructuring of MTEWA's ED for better policy planning and coordination and the strengthening of CEA&#13;
to better carry out its analytical, monitoring and enforcement responsibilities; (ii) support ongoing efforts&#13;
to integrate environmental considerations in the overall development planning process; and (iii) help&#13;
GOSL take immediate remedial measures to reverse the trend of environmental degradation through pilot&#13;
programs involving participatory approaches to environmental management.&#13;
C.     Summary Description&#13;
3.3    The project would be the initial five-year phase of an expected long term program of IDA&#13;
support for sustaining government capacity in the field of environmental planning and management. The&#13;
project would comprise three major components:&#13;
(a)    Institutional Strengthening (US$12.5 million) for: (i) restructuring ED within MTEWA&#13;
to allow it to play a central role in environmental policy, planning and coordination at&#13;
the national level; (ii) restructuring and strengthening CEA through establishment and&#13;
implementation of a staff development program, enhancement of the Industrial&#13;
Licensing and Inspection Program, development of environmental codes of practice for&#13;
small industries, improvement of EIA capacity, and strengthening of the environmental&#13;
information system; (iii) provision of office and technical facilities to accommodate both&#13;
ED and CEA7; and (iv) studies of the linkages between sector and economy-wide&#13;
policies and the environment including an annual review of the environmental&#13;
implications of the PIP and further updating of the NEAP. Finally, it would include a&#13;
policy letter and a policy action plan that would broadly define legal, institutional, and&#13;
policy changes that are required for sound environmental management. Formal&#13;
covenants, however, would only be directly related to the proposed project;&#13;
(b)    Community Environmental Initiatives Facilitv (CEIF) (US$4.7 million) which would&#13;
be established to finance well-planned environmental activities at the grass-roots level&#13;
within the priority NEAP/PIP. CEIF would provide a mechanism for pooling resources&#13;
(to which other donors could also contribute) and serve as a vehicle for private sector&#13;
and NGO participation and for decentralizing environmental activities; and&#13;
A detailed staffing plan for restructuring ED and strengthening CEA has been agreed upon with MTEWA.&#13;
Financing of the above would include incremental staff, training, consultancy, vehicles, civil work, and&#13;
equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
(c)    Pilot Land Management Component  (US$ 3.5 million) which would entail pilot&#13;
projects involving community participation to rehabilitate degraded lands.&#13;
D.      Detailed Features&#13;
Institutional Strengthening (US$12.5 million)&#13;
3.4    To ensure that the institutional strengthening component is not undermined by duplication or&#13;
overlap of perceived roles of ministries and government agencies, the respective mandates of the&#13;
Environment Division and CEA satisfactory to IDA have been clarified by MTEWA during Negotiations&#13;
and a letter to that effect was submitted by the GOSL negotiating team.&#13;
3.5    Policy and Planning Assistance to the Environment Division (ED). The project would support the&#13;
establishment of a Policy Unit, headed by a Senior Policy Advisor. The project would assist this unit to&#13;
develop policy analysis and consensus-building capabilities that are now virtually absent at the national&#13;
level and ensure institutionalization of the NEAP process in combination with the public investment&#13;
planning process. The main policy mission of the Unit would include: (i) providing policy advice and&#13;
assisting in policy studies and policy formulation in all matters related to environmental conservation&#13;
(para 3.13): (ii) preparing papers for Cabinet to decide on major environment issues requiring decision;&#13;
(iii) managing a research program on priority environmental policy issues related to the PIP; (iv) serving&#13;
as the Secretariat of the Committee on Integrating Environment and Development Policy, which would&#13;
entail preparing policy briefs for consideration by the Committee (para. 4.1); (v) liaising with&#13;
environmental policy networks in Sri Lanka and the region; and (vi) assisting the NEAP updating&#13;
process. The planning mission of the Unit would include: (i) managing the periodic NEAP updating&#13;
process, making full use of the network of sectoral focus groups that prepared the last NEAP update and&#13;
policy staff of the Policy Planning Unit; (ii) seeking and coordinating line agency, NGO and donor&#13;
involvement in the implementation of NEAP activities; and (iii) monitoring and reporting on&#13;
implementation of activities under the NEAP. Assurance were obtained at Negotiations that the policy&#13;
unit would be established by July 31, 1997 and that the updated NEAP covering the period 1999-2002&#13;
would be issued no later than September 30, 1997 (para 6.1 (a), (b)).&#13;
3.6    To assist development of policy and planning capabilities within the Unit, the project would&#13;
finance: (i) additional staff (para 4.3); (ii) technical assistance to assist the Senior Policy Advisor prepare&#13;
annual policy research and NEAP work programs and monitor key performance indicators (para 4.17);&#13;
(iii) a training program to expose the staff to environmental policy analysis and planning activities in&#13;
other countries, including participation in regional environmental policy conferences and a twinning&#13;
arrangement with an overseas environmental agency with relevant policy and planning experience&#13;
(Annexes 4-5); (iv) research and publications budget; and (v) vehicles and office equipment.&#13;
3.7    Assistance to CEA.    To improve CEA's regulatory and enforcement capabilities, a&#13;
comprehensive program has been designed, focusing on the following areas: (i) redefinition of CEA's&#13;
mandate: with the transfer of policy-making activities to ED (see para. 3.5), CEA will concentrate its&#13;
resources primarily on regulatory and enforcement activities; (ii) institutional restructuring: CEA will be&#13;
reorganized to increase staff efficiency and motivation; (iii) review of incentives structure: to increase&#13;
CEA's capacity to attract and retain highly qualified and competent staff in key positions; (iv) human&#13;
resources development: this will provide strengthening of competence of existing staff within the&#13;
institution as a complement to attracting highly qualified new recruits; (v) contracting out of selected&#13;
activities: this would allow CEA to concentrate more efficiently on a limited number of truly critical&#13;
facilitating and regulatory activities that cannot be performed by the private sector; and (vi) revision of the&#13;
fees structure of CEA: this would diminish the budgetary impact of CEA operations and ensure a&#13;
rational, market-related approach to fees collected by CEA.&#13;
3.8    To assist in strengthening CEA, the project would finance: (i) technical assistance:  for&#13;
reviewing, early in the project, CEA's staff incentives; improving CEA-PAAs (line agencies) linkages in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
environmental assessment; expanding the codes of practices for enforcement; overcoming the backlog of&#13;
applications; refining existing ambient quality standards; designing training programs for CEA staff;&#13;
improving information management systems; increasing private sector involvement in enforcement&#13;
activities; and reviewing the fees structure of CEA with special emphasis on improving the collection of&#13;
fees for the renewal of licenses (para. 3.32 and Annex 5); (ii) human resources development program:&#13;
this includes on-the-job training in basic aspects of inspection and follow-up and training of CEA&#13;
managers to analyze enforcement options and optimize CEA resource allocation, and a twinning&#13;
arrangement with an overseas environmental agency with relevant enforcement experience (Annex 5);&#13;
(iii) vehicles and equipment; and (iv) pilot programs. Based on the findings of the technical assistance&#13;
studies on staff incentives and private sector involvement, two pilot programs will be implemented. The&#13;
first will implement an improved incentive system for CEA staff, with potential testing of promotion&#13;
scores for the evaluation of merit/seniority-based incentives, the role of competition between enforcement&#13;
teams, and systems for improved supervisory practices. The second pilot will implement the findings of&#13;
the study to increase the role of private entities in environmental enforcement through the cost-effective&#13;
and closely controlled contracting out of specific steps in the enforcement processes. Overall control&#13;
would remain CEA's responsibility, while intermediate steps would be delegated to private or semi-private&#13;
firms and foundations. This would allow the selective tapping of expertise from outside the public sector&#13;
and would allow a flexible response to changing enforcement requirements. Assurance was obtained at&#13;
Negotiations that studies of staff incentives, private sector involvement, and an appropriate license fee&#13;
structure for CEA would commence no later than September 30, 1997 and that the GOSL wouldfurnish to&#13;
IDA no later than March 31, 1998, the action plans based on the results of the studies and would carry&#13;
out these plans after IDA review/approval (para. 6.1 (c)).&#13;
3.9    Joint ED/CEA Premises.  In order to increase the synergy between CEA and ED, the project&#13;
would support the construction of common office facilities to accommodate both entities. The existing&#13;
scattered set-up of MTEWA's environmental entities has been identified as a major cause of the current&#13;
disconnection between policy setting and enforcement, low staff morale, and limited impact of the NEAP&#13;
on sector work. Grouping the ED and CEA under one roof would be especially important for the success&#13;
of the present project which would lead to the increased size of ED and to covenanted actions that have to&#13;
be undertaken in close collaboration between the two groups8. The final design of the joint premises,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, have been completed.&#13;
3.10    Environmental Monitoring System.  To  promote more efficient collection and analysis of&#13;
environmental monitoring data, develop a national environmental monitoring network that meets the&#13;
requirements of MTEWA's enforcement responsibilities and develop CEA's role as hub of the monitoring&#13;
network, the project would finance technical assistance to promote development of an integrated&#13;
environmental monitoring and information network for Sri Lanka, including: (a) a monitoring network&#13;
design exercise keyed to enforcement priorities; (b) on-the-job training for MTEWA staff and other&#13;
participants in the network; and (c) an 18-month pilot monitoring exercise using the network design&#13;
(para. 3.32 &amp; Annex 5). The system would be capable of (a) storing, displaying, and manipulating data&#13;
including Geographical Information System (GIS) data; (b) storing and displaying data to assist in the&#13;
management of the EIA, pollution control, and environmental monitoring tasks; (c) storing and&#13;
classifying industries in accordance with their pollution potential and providing, as far as is possible,&#13;
automation for the processing of environmental protection licenses; and (d) making provision for&#13;
publication of the available data.&#13;
3.11    Donor Coordination. To have better donor coordination in the environmental sector, the project&#13;
would provide a framework within which donor involvement on key policy and institutional issues&#13;
would be increased, and donor funding would be channeled to high priority activities. As part of the&#13;
8 The regrouping of ED and CEA under one roof would accommodate only the enviromnent-related entities of&#13;
MTEWA and will not be adversely affected by future shuffling of departnents between ministries, which is a&#13;
likely occurrence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
institutionalization of the NEAP process in combination with the public investment process, the Policy&#13;
Unit of ED would closely liaise with the donor community and involve them in deliberations on the policy&#13;
reform agenda and annual update of NEAP. The donor representatives would also be invited to attend&#13;
meetings of the Committee on Integrating Environment and Development Policy to review environment-&#13;
related activities in the PIP, NEAP, Policy Action Plan and the on-going investments.&#13;
3.12   NGOs. To improve information exchange with NGOs and better tap their potential contributions&#13;
to environmental management in Sri Lanka, the project would assist ED and CEA in developing and&#13;
implementing an NGO outreach program that would provide: (a) training for NGOs in technical,&#13;
managerial, and financial skills to contribute to activities under the six main NEAP subject areas, with&#13;
particular emphasis on local natural resource management activities and environmental education; (b)&#13;
opportunities for NGO representatives to participate in environmental policy and the NEAP updating&#13;
activities of ED; (c) opportunities for qualified NGOs to assist in local soil conservation programs and&#13;
related activities under the pilot land management component (see para. 4.11); and (d) coordination of the&#13;
release of environmental information by ED, CEA, and NGOs' environmental education programs, and&#13;
encouragement of expansion of NGOs' role in environmental education. As a condition of participation&#13;
in training offered under the project, NGOs have been asked to organize into thematic groups under the&#13;
six priority issues of the NEAP, through which they would communicate with ED and CEA. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at Negotiations that an NGO outreach program satisfactory to IDA would be finalized by&#13;
September 30, 1997, and implemented soon after (para. 6.1 (d)). This subcomponent would also improve&#13;
NGO capacity to qualify for grants under the CEIF component.&#13;
3.13    Policy Subcomponent. The objective of the policy component is to develop and institutionalize&#13;
a framework for the consideration of economic-environmental linkages in Sri Lanka. Toward this end,&#13;
the component will support (i) studies to further analyze the policy implications of economic-&#13;
environmental linkages at the macro- and sector-specific levels; (ii) dissemination of reports on the State&#13;
of Sri Lanka's Environment and an update of the NEAP (paras. 2.34 and 6.1 (b)); and (iii) workshops to&#13;
reinforce broad ownership and improve adherence to sound environmental principles, with participation&#13;
of government representatives and other concerned stakeholders.&#13;
3.14   Monitoring of Policy Agenda. GOSL has supplemented the policy letter of September 1, 1995&#13;
(Annex 9 [A9.9]) by a Policy Action Plan satisfactory to IDA (Annex 2). Both documents will assist the&#13;
government in reviewing macro- and sector-wide policies with impact on the environment. The policy&#13;
letter spells out the institutional and legal changes and broadly sets out the policy changes required for&#13;
sound environmental management. Moreover, the policy letter would serve as a vehicle for updating the&#13;
needed measures as well as a framework for the dialogue with donors. These policies would form an&#13;
integral part of the ongoing IDA-assisted projects and IDA's policy dialogue with the government.&#13;
Community Environment Initiatives Facility (CEIF) (US$4.7 million)&#13;
3.15   The main objective of the CEIF is to involve communities through participatory methods in&#13;
implementing demonstration environmental activities, providing facilities to train local communities in&#13;
participatory work in the field of environment and conservation, and undertaking activities within the&#13;
priority areas of the updated NEAP. This component was designed after demand for such a fund was&#13;
confirmed by a series of MTEWA-NGO consultations. It is built on the experience gained and lessons&#13;
learned from other similar arrangements elsewhere (Annex 9 [A9. 6]).&#13;
3.16   Proiect Selection Criteria. The fund will seek proposals in the six program areas listed in the&#13;
updated NEAP (para. 2.34) from local government institutions, community groups and NGOs, and&#13;
research organizations. These subprojects would include the improved management of degraded and&#13;
unproductive lands, improved management of water and water catchments, community participation in&#13;
solid and domestic waste collection, improved management of wetlands (coastal, freshwater, and marine&#13;
resources), deforestation, improved management of stream reservations, and environmental education and&#13;
mass awareness programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
3.17    Eligibility Criteria. The following summarizes the eligibility criteria that are proposed for the&#13;
activities. Details are in the operational manual for the implementation of the CEIF which has been&#13;
prepared by MTEWA and reviewed by IDA (para 4.9).&#13;
* would make a contribution to growth and sustainable economic development;&#13;
* should be cost-effective and should have a satisfactory rate of return if quantifiable;&#13;
* would help solve a critical environmental problem;&#13;
* would mitigate losses of natural resources;&#13;
* would be capable of replication and/or expansion and have a demonstration effect;&#13;
local government and community groups would meet at least 20% of the cost of the activity,&#13;
either as labor, cash and/or material;&#13;
* would test new and innovative approaches and technologies;&#13;
* the beneficiaries would meet the maintenance cost on completion of activity;&#13;
* would be technically sound and technologically simple;&#13;
* would be undertaken by trained personnel; and&#13;
* would have a significant poverty alleviation component.&#13;
3.18    Special Conditions. (i) For the first twelve months, the emphasis would be on proposals for&#13;
training in skills to prepare and manage activities (financial management, human resource development,&#13;
community organization, and management of groups) and 30% of the funds approved would be for such&#13;
training; (ii) not more than 5% of approvals in any calendar year should be for testing new and innovative&#13;
approaches; (iii) expenditures would be supported by an audit of accounts by a recognized firm of&#13;
auditors; (iv) proposals would not cause involuntary resettlement of people; and (v) activities would be&#13;
subjected to environmental review highlighting the environmental benefits and possible risks. The&#13;
minimum subproject amount would be the equivalent of US$5,000 and the maximum amount would be&#13;
US$100,000. Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that the criteria and conditions in this para and&#13;
in para 3.17 would be observed (para 6.1 (e)).&#13;
Pilot Land Management Component (US$3.5 million)&#13;
3.19    The  objectives of the pilot land management component are to: (i) test and develop on a&#13;
watershed basis suitable technologies for minimizing the extent of land degradation, thereby increasing&#13;
agricultural productivity as well as reducing the risk of erosion and its associated on-farm and off-farm&#13;
impacts; (ii) examine feasibility of participatory management of microwatersheds by the beneficiaries;&#13;
and (iii) define technical and investment criteria useful in replicating watershed development activities in&#13;
other hilly areas.&#13;
3.20    The pilot activities will be carried out in the hilly wet zone area of Sri Lanka's mid- and upper&#13;
country of the Central Province. They will cover ten representative microcatchments (MCs)&#13;
(600 to 1,000 ha each) selected in subwatersheds to cover an optimal range of micro-agroecological&#13;
environments (with varying rainfall, slope, and soil conditions). The project adopts a holistic and&#13;
participatory approach to involve local population as beneficiaries from the planning stage through&#13;
implementation and assessment of project results. The project will cover activities on the farmer's field,&#13;
and all off-farm  land within the microwatersheds.  Key elements of the project strategy focus on&#13;
stabilizing upland farming by increased control over resources.&#13;
3.21    The range of interventions in arable land will incorporate elements of the Sloping Agricultural&#13;
Land Technology (SALT) by encouraging the planting of leguminous shrubs, grasses (including vetiver),&#13;
and tree crops along the bunds of existing terraces, or along contours in unterraced lands. These soil&#13;
stabilization and moisture retention treatments will complement mixed farming systems of food crops,&#13;
fruit and timber trees, and estate crops. Treatments on non-arable land (range lands, wastelands,&#13;
degraded forests) and natural drainage courses will include measures such as vegetative fencing,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
stabilization through vegetative contour barriers, contour furrowing, diversion drains, gully control, and&#13;
bank stabilization through vegetative measures, storage, and management of run off in natural&#13;
depressions/partially dug out structures with low dams to promote the recharge of groundwater and&#13;
decongest blocked drainage lines.&#13;
3.22    Adaptive Research. A flexible approach would be followed for adaptive research covering in situ&#13;
vegetative soil and moisture conservation measures, with new topics added as appropriate. Research&#13;
activities would include: (i) run off trials to estimate soil losses from arable and non-arable land on&#13;
varying slopes and (ii) demonstrations and cost-effectiveness testing of various bioengineering approaches&#13;
to soil and water conservation.&#13;
3.23    Studies. Provision would be made under the project for a baseline study incorporating a survey&#13;
that would be undertaken by a consultant group (paras. 3.32). The appointment of the consultants for the&#13;
baseline study would be a condition of Effectiveness (para. 3.32 and 6.2 (a)). Provision is also made&#13;
under the project for studies that are relevant and useful to the overall goals of the land component.&#13;
3.24    To support these works, the project will provide funds to meet the costs of land use mapping,&#13;
land use planning, crop inputs, seedlings, vegetative and mechanical treatments, demonstration plots,&#13;
mass awareness, training, vehicles, equipment, consultancy services, incremental staff, and operating&#13;
costs. To ensure the provision of high-quality planting materials, as well as to diminish transportation&#13;
problems, the project will also support the development of village-based nurseries.&#13;
E.     Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.25    Cost Estimates. The total project cost over the five-year period (FY98-FY02) is estimated to be&#13;
Rs. 1322 million (US$20.7 million) with a foreign exchange component of Rs.494.4 million or 37%. This&#13;
amount includes a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance of US$1.1 million to finance start-up&#13;
activities before project commencement. Project base costs are estimated at US$18.65 million; physical&#13;
contingencies are estimated to be US$0.80 million, and price contingencies are estimated to be US$1.30&#13;
million. Base costs though originally expressed at December 1995 price levels have been revised in&#13;
December 1996 to reflect price escalation during the last one year. The base costs include duties and taxes&#13;
estimated at US$1.70 million. For the most part, the base cost estimates reflect the expenditures of&#13;
comparable government agency operations, including  staff training, technical assistance, studies,&#13;
construction contracts, and vehicle and equipment purchases. Consultant service costs are based on recent&#13;
contracts for similar services in Sri Lanka. The cost estimates include allowances for physical&#13;
contingencies of 15% for civil works and 10% for machinery, equipment, and materials. The cost&#13;
estimates also include allowances for price escalations during the implementation period based on IDA&#13;
estimates for domestic and foreign inflation rates as shown in Table 3.1, and assume that exchange rates&#13;
would be maintained at purchasing power parity.&#13;

3.26    Financin . Table 3.3 shows the proposed project financing plan. IDA, GOSL, and the local&#13;
communities would jointly finance the project. IDA would provide a credit of SDR 10.7 million (US$14.8&#13;
million), local communities Rs.157.2 million (US$2.5 million), which would be in labor, material or&#13;
cash, and GOSL the remaining Rs.218.5 million (US$3.4 million) including the financing of taxes. The&#13;
IDA credit would finance 71% of project costs, including 100% of foreign exchange costs and 70% of&#13;
local costs. Excluding duties, taxes, and community contributions, IDA would finance 90% of project&#13;
costs.&#13;

3.28    Procurement will involve: civil works; vehicles, equipment, and materials; technical assistance,&#13;
special studies, and training and incremental recurrent costs.  Procurement arrangements for these&#13;
categories would be as follows.&#13;
3.29    Civil Works (US$3.00 million).  This would include the construction of an office complex for&#13;
MTEWA's ED and CEA (US$2.90 million) and farmers' centers for the land management component&#13;
(US$0.10 million). The amount of civil works is small and, as such, is not expected to attract any foreign&#13;
contractors. The civil works for the office building will be undertaken following National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) procedures satisfactory and acceptable to IDA. Farmers' centers would be constructed&#13;
following force account procedures. It has been agreed with GOSL that MTEWA would use IDA's&#13;
Standard Bidding Document for Works.&#13;
3.30    Field Works (US$2.42 million excluding CEIF). Field works would include soil conservation&#13;
works (gully plugging, stone terracing, checking dams, planting of vegetative hedges), adaptive research&#13;
trials, and demonstration plots. These works are small and scattered, undertaken at many sites, and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
several instances require close supervision by Departmental staff. For these reasons MAL&amp;F would&#13;
execute field works by force account.&#13;
3.31    Vehicles. equipment, and materials (US$3.11 million excluding CEIF). Vehicles for the project&#13;
consist of four-wheel drive jeeps, cars, vans and motorcycles. Vehicles to an estimated value of US$1.79&#13;
million and equipment (US$1.25 million), consisting of laboratory equipment, computers, printers,&#13;
related goods and furniture, will be procured through a single contract or contracts grouped into a&#13;
homogenous package, using International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The procuring agencies would use&#13;
IDA's standard ICB bidding documents for goods 9. Field equipment (US$0.07 million) would be&#13;
procured through NCB. Contract packages valued at less than US$100,000 but more than US$50,000, up&#13;
to an aggregate value of US$0.2 million to be financed by IDA, would be procured using NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Goods and materials valued at less than US$50,000, but in aggregate amounting to&#13;
not more than US$0.2 million to be financed by IDA, would be procured through local shopping, based&#13;
on price quotations from at least three different suppliers. This level of shopping would be needed&#13;
because of the number of agencies involved in project implementation, each with specific and differing&#13;
needs. For goods under ICB, qualifying domestic suppliers would be eligible for a margin of preferences&#13;
in the comparison of bids of 15% (15% of the CIF cost of imported items or the applicable customs duty&#13;
and other related import taxes, whichever is less).&#13;
3.32    Consultant Services, Studies, and Training.10  Consultants' services (US$2.98 million)  and&#13;
studies (US$1.04 million) would be procured according to IDA Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). Roughly US$1.40&#13;
million would be internationally recruited. Foreign and local training (US$1.17 million) would be&#13;
administered in accordance with annual training programs agreed with IDA. TORs and recruitment&#13;
schedule for the technical assistance, including studies (paras. 3.8, 3.10, 3.13, 3.23, 4.14) and the&#13;
training and research programs assistance (paras. 3.6, 3.8) satisfactory to the Association have been&#13;
prepared. The appointment of major consultancies would be a condition of Effectiveness. This includes&#13;
consultancies for: (i) contracting out CEA's activities; (ii) salary structure and license fees; (iii)&#13;
policy/planning assistance; (iv) CEA's license backlog; and (v) the baseline survey and monitoring the&#13;
work relating to land use mapping and planning; and community group formation for the land&#13;
management component (Annex 4 and paras. 4.14 and 6.2 (a).&#13;
3.33    Community Environment Initiative Facility  (CEIF) (US$4.24 million). CEIF is designed to&#13;
provide funds to local communities, NGOs, and local-level authorities for undertaking activities within&#13;
the priority areas. CEIF would finance small works in widely scattered villages. The procurement&#13;
method for CEIF would follow the applicable procedures for the various types of goods as set forth above.&#13;
3.34    Incremental Recurrent Costs (US$2.80 million). Project expenditures on incremental operating&#13;
costs (US$2.80 million, including salaries and allowances; operating and maintenance costs of vehicles,&#13;
equipment, and civil works; and administrative overheads) would also be procured following normnal&#13;
government procedures. IDA, however, would only disburse against incremental staff salaries and&#13;
operational and maintenance expenditures for vehicles and civil works.&#13;
9   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1.6 of the Procurement Guidelines, the proceeds of the Interim&#13;
Fund Credit may only be withdrawn on account of expenditures for goods and work provided by nationals of,&#13;
and produced in or supplied from, Participating Countries; consequently, nationals of countries that are not&#13;
Participating Countries and bidders offering goods and works form such countries shall be disqualified from&#13;
bidding for such contracts, and the bidding documents shall so specify.&#13;
0  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1.02 of the Consultants Guidelines, only consultants form&#13;
Participating Countries shall be eligible to provide services financed out of the proceeds of the Interim Fund&#13;
Credit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
3.35   IDA's Prior Review. The following would be subject to IDA's prior review: (a) contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of ICB procedures; (b) contracts for works and goods in excess of US$200,000&#13;
equivalent; (c) consultant contracts in excess of US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000&#13;
equivalent for individuals; and (d) foreign training programs. However, with respect to all consulting&#13;
contracts, irrespective of value, prior IDA review would be required for the terms of reference and&#13;
selection procedures. The IDA staff would selectively post review about 10% of the awarded contracts&#13;
(including bid evaluations) that are below the threshold levels. The Director, Project Coordination in&#13;
MTEWA would be responsible for all procurement matters. To avoid delays, procurement plans for Year&#13;
1 and Year 2 have been prepared and are acceptable to IDA. Procurement information would be included&#13;
in periodical progress implementation reports to be submitted by MTEWA. Annex 4, Tables 2-4 show&#13;
the project implementation schedule including procurement.&#13;
G.     Disbursements&#13;
3.36   IDA credit of US$14.8 million would be disbursed over a period of five years, beginning in the&#13;
last quarter of FY97, through the end of the last quarter of IDA FY02. For the proposed project, costs&#13;
would be linked to project implementation plans (through the use of Computerized Project Management&#13;
(para. 4.18)) in order to develop realistic forecasts of cash flow requirements. The disbursement schedule&#13;
shown in Annex 3, Table 9 is based on completion of the proposed project by June 30, 2002. The total&#13;
disbursement period for the project is expected to be about five years after credit approval. The proceeds&#13;
of the credit would be disbursed as shown in Table 3.5.&#13;
Table 3.5: Proposed Disbursement Schedule&#13;
Category                                     Percentage to be Financed&#13;
(a)  civil works (other than field works)  90% of expenditures&#13;
(b) field works and soil conservation    70 % of expenditures&#13;
(c)  Vehicles, motorcycles, equipment,   100% of foreign expenditures and 100% of&#13;
furniture, and materials            local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 80%&#13;
for locally procured equipment&#13;
(d)  Consultant services, training, and  100% of expenditures on consultant services,&#13;
studies                             training, and studies&#13;
(e)  Operating costs of ED, CEA, and     90 % of expenditures&#13;
MAL&amp;F&#13;
(f)  Incremental staff salaries and allowances, Salaries would be funded according to a&#13;
of ED and CEA                       declining basis starting at 90% financing until&#13;
December 31, 1998, 70% financing until&#13;
December 31, 1999, 50% financing until&#13;
December 31, 2001, and 25% until the project&#13;
completion date&#13;
3.37   IDA would disburse against certified statements of expenditures (SOEs) for (a) civil works and&#13;
goods contracts below US$200,000 equivalent; (b) consultant services for firms for contracts below&#13;
US$100,000 and individual contracts below US$50,000; and (c) local training, field works; and&#13;
incremental staff salaries, allowances, and operating costs. Disbursement applications for all other items&#13;
would be fully documented. Supporting documentation for SOEs would not be submitted to IDA, but&#13;
would be retained by GOSL and made available to IDA staff during supervision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
3.38    Special Account.  To facilitate timely project implementation and disbursements, the&#13;
Government would establish and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, one Special&#13;
Account in the Central Bank. Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that (i) a Special Account&#13;
would be established and held in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and (ii) MTEWA will be responsible for&#13;
channeling funds directly to all the implementing agencies including the Central Provincial Council,&#13;
Land Use Policy Planning Unit and Natural Resources Management Unit (para. 6.1 69). The Special&#13;
Account would cover the Bank's share of eligible project expenditures in all disbursement categories. The&#13;
Special Account would be denominated in US Dollars, with an authorized allocation of US$1.2 million;&#13;
however, the authorized allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to US$700,000 until&#13;
disbursements and outstanding commitments against the credit equal or exceed SDR 4.0 million.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the Special Account supported by appropriate documentation would be&#13;
submitted regularly (preferably monthly, but not less than quarterly) or when the amounts withdrawn&#13;
equal 50% of the initial deposit. The Account would be operated and managed by the Director,&#13;
Coordination, MTEWA who would have responsibility for the preparation of withdrawal applications and&#13;
have sole responsibility for submitting the withdrawal applications to IDA for payment.&#13;
3.39   Project Preparation Facility (PPF). A PPF of US$1.1 million has been approved to complete&#13;
several up-front actions by MTEWA, CEA, and MAL&amp;F before Board presentation. There is a need to&#13;
build up the capacity of the implementing agencies to develop realistic plans, programs, designs, and&#13;
initiate training plans before project commencement. Funds to reimburse this advance would be disbursed&#13;
from this credit upon its effectiveness.&#13;
H.     Auditing and Reporting&#13;
3.40   Accounts. MTEWA would establish and maintain  a separate project account with a local&#13;
commercial bank giving breakdowns for civil works; vehicles and equipment; consulting services,&#13;
technical assistance, and training. MTEWA would have the overall responsibility arranging annual audits&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The annual audited statements of project accounts including&#13;
SOEs, Special Account, and the Project Account would be submitted to IDA within six months after the&#13;
close of each fiscal year. The project accounting system would record: (a) funds advanced periodically to&#13;
the various project units for program development expenditures; and (b) expenditures on identifiable&#13;
schemes, including agency overhead payments. The sub-accounts would be used to meet operational&#13;
expenses such as purchase of supplies and payment of field allowances and would receive advances from&#13;
the Project Account, based on approved work programs and budgets. Replenishment of the sub-accounts&#13;
from the Project Account would be made only on receipt of all documented expenses as approved by the&#13;
Head of the implementing agency concerned.&#13;
3.41    Audit. The records and accounts of all implementing agencies would be audited annually.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that all project accounts and financial statements,&#13;
including Statements of Expenditures and the Special Account, would be audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Assurances were also obtained during Negotiations that a copy of the audit report&#13;
and a certified copy of the financial statements would be submitted to IDA no later than six months after&#13;
the close of each fiscal year (para. 6.1 (g)).&#13;
I.     Environment&#13;
3.42    This project would address the two major areas of environmental management: (i) proactive&#13;
environmental processes: ensuring a sustainable NEAP process and its integration in the overall&#13;
development planning of Sri Lanka, the project would allow the identification of investment opportunities&#13;
that are important for their sustainability/environmental merit that might not necessarily be identified&#13;
through 'traditional" development planning processes; and (ii) impact assessment processes: by&#13;
supporting government delivery of impact assessment services, the project would lead to an improved&#13;
consideration of the environmental impacts of public and private investments. The project emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
institutional development and policy action would therefore lead to long-term environmental benefits that&#13;
have a potential to improve the decision-making process toward sustainable development. Most&#13;
environmental benefits under these two components would span beyond the life of this 5-year project.&#13;
3.43   The two investment components would lead to demonstrable and measurable improvement in&#13;
environmental conditions. CEIF would promote environmental management in both rural and urban&#13;
environments, for the most vulnerable of people, who are arguably the first victims of environmental&#13;
degradation. By targeting CEIF resources to environmental problems in low-income areas, the project&#13;
would increase the probability of having funds reach the most important environmental hot spots with&#13;
respect to their impact on health and living conditions of the poor. By using a grass-roots, participatory&#13;
approach to environmental rehabilitation, the project would increase the impact and sustainability of these&#13;
actions. Finally, the investments in land management, by stressing low-cost, vegetative approaches to land&#13;
rehabilitation, would lead to measurable improvement in the land-carrying capacity and reduce the&#13;
adverse impact of soil erosion both on-site and downstream of rehabilitated areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A.     Coordination&#13;
4.1    MTEWA would be responsible for overall coordination of project implementation and would be&#13;
IDA's main contact regarding implementation. MTEWA would have principal responsibility for the&#13;
institutional strengthening component including the policy subcomponent (in close collaboration with&#13;
MFP). The MAL&amp;F would be responsible for the pilot land management component. NGOs and&#13;
communities would also play an important part in the planning and implementation of the land&#13;
management component and CEIF. A Steering Committee (SC), headed by the Secretary, MTEWA,&#13;
would meet once every three months to ensure coordinated implementation of project activities. The&#13;
inter-sectoral nature of many environmental concerns and the diverse information required for effective&#13;
management mean, inevitably, that several agencies have to be involved in the steering of overall&#13;
environmental policy work, including this project. A Committee on Integrating Environment and&#13;
Development Policy (CIEDP), chaired by the Secretary, MFP as well as Secretary, MTEWA, would meet&#13;
once a year to review environment-related activities in the PIP, NEAP, Policy Action Plan, and this&#13;
project. Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that the SC and the CIEDP with membership,&#13;
responsibilities, and resources satisfactory to IDA would be established by July 31, 1997, and&#13;
maintained after that (6.1 (h)).&#13;
B.     Implementation&#13;
4.2    Implementation arrangements are summarized below and detailed in Annex 4.&#13;
Institutional Strengthenin&#13;
4.3    Ministry of Transport, Environment and Women's Affairs.  The ED of MTEWA would be&#13;
restructured under the existing two Additional Secretary positions (see Annex 8, Chart 1). One Additional&#13;
Secretary would be responsible for the development of environmental policies and programs through small&#13;
professional Directorates focused on a range of environmental sectors.  For studies on economic-&#13;
environmental linkages (para 3.13), the Additional Secretary will head a multi-disciplinary committee to&#13;
finalize, subcontract and monitor the execution of priorities studies identified during project preparation&#13;
(Annex 4). The other Additional Secretary would be responsible for administration of the ED and for&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the extent to which national environmental policy is being effectively&#13;
implemented. The ED's main functions are described in para 3.5. The project would support an increase&#13;
in the cadre of professional and technical officers from the present level of 12 (10 in-situ) to 27. The&#13;
project would also support consultants to assist MTEWA implementing and managing the project. The&#13;
recruitment schedule is summarized in Table 4.1, and detailed in Annex 4, fig. 1.&#13;
4.4    Central Environmental Authoritv. CEA would be restructured into three Divisions, each under a&#13;
Deputy Director General (Annex 4, fig. 2-5 and Annex 8, Charts 2-5). This action should lead to a&#13;
stronger management structure as well as clearer career path opportunities for staff. The two core&#13;
functions of CEA are the environmental assessment of new proposals and the control and prevention of&#13;
pollution from existing activities.  These functions both involve two major tasks: pre-operational&#13;
assessment and post-operational enforcement. These two tasks would be integrated under one Deputy&#13;
Director General (DDG) for pollution control matters and under a second DDG for the management and&#13;
evaluation of environmental impact assessment. The latter DDG would also be responsible for a small&#13;
research and project management group. The third DDG would be responsible for the environmental&#13;
promotion and public awareness program together with the administrative and financial functions.&#13;
Included in this functional area is a need for immediate development of a strong human resource&#13;
management ability to spearhead the recruitment of professional and technical staff, initially to fill&#13;
existing vacancies and thereafter to increase the staffing level to that necessary for CEA to effectively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
carry out its functions. The project would support an increase of cadre of professional and technical&#13;
officers from the present level of 87 (63 in-situ) to 135.&#13;
4.5    The staff changes envisaged for CEA can be summarized as follows: (i) recruitment of 24 staff&#13;
into already approved positions; (ii) upgrading of 8 existing cadre positions (Annex 4, fig. 6); and (iii)&#13;
depending on the outcome of contracting-out and fee restructuring studies, (para 3.8), creation and&#13;
recruitment of up to 48 professional and technical positions which would be funded by increases in&#13;
environmental protection license fees. The recruitment schedule is summarized in Table 4. 1 and detailed&#13;
in Annex 4, fig. 2-5.&#13;
4.6    Assurances were obtained at Negotiation that ED and CEA would recruit the additional staff&#13;
according to the following timetable (para. 6.1 (i)).&#13;

Community Environment Initiatives Facility&#13;
4.7    Administration. MTEWA would be responsible for the administration of the Facility. MTEWA&#13;
has called through media announcements for proposals from local government agencies, NGOs, approved&#13;
societies, and research organizations.&#13;
4.8    A Committee, with membership and responsibilities satisfactory to the Association, has been&#13;
appointed for the administration and management of the Facility.  The Committee consists of the&#13;
Secretary, MTEWA (Chairman), Secretary, MFP, one representative of NGOs involved in environment&#13;
and conservation, one representative from research or the academic community with interest in&#13;
environmental issues, and one other representative from the private sector. The ED would be responsible&#13;
for the overall coordination.&#13;
4.9    Implementation. MTEWA has prepared an operational manual satisfactory to IDA that outlines&#13;
the procedures to be followed in operation of the Facility and guidelines to applicants. The local&#13;
government authorities, NGOs, approved societies or research organizations would identify, prepare,&#13;
implement and manage the subprojects. Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that the Committee&#13;
would (a) make a selection of the subprojects only after having an evaluation of such proposals carried&#13;
out by consultants, recruited in accordance with IDA guidelines, provided that the evaluation of the first&#13;
five proposals reviewed, and all subsequent proposals for subprojects estimated to cost $200,000&#13;
equivalent or more, will have been furnished to the Association for its approval prior to submission to the&#13;
Committee; (b) ensure that all proposals selected to be financed meet eligibility criteria agreed with the&#13;
Association, including, without limitation, the following: (i) the participating organizations proposed to&#13;
carry out the subprojects are local government authorities, non-governmental organizations, approved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
societies or research organizations, provided that such organizations shall (A) have at least two years of&#13;
experience dealing with environmental issues and in organizing and assisting community groups, and (B)&#13;
have adequate administrative, financial and managerial capacity; (ii) contribution of participating&#13;
organizations of at least 20% either in cash or in kind; (iii) no involuntary resettlement is involved; and&#13;
(iv) environmental benefits and risks have been assessed; (c) prepare participation agreements, inform&#13;
and substance satisfactory to IDA, setting out the responsibilities of MTEWA and the various&#13;
participating organizations for implementing and supervising the selected proposals; and (d) hire&#13;
services of specialists to carry out detailed evaluation of CEIF on the average of twice a year (para.&#13;
6.10)).&#13;
4.10    CEIF Account.  For the first year a block allocation of the equivalent of US$0.2 million has&#13;
been made by GOSL through budgetary sources into the sub-account maintained by MTEWA. IDA would&#13;
replenish the Facility upon submission of a withdrawal application. GOSL would contribute a further&#13;
US$0.5 million twelve months later and the IDA contribution would be US$2.37 million. Other donors&#13;
would also be invited to contribute to the Fund. The implementing agencies would be required to maintain&#13;
separate accounts for the funds received and expenditures incurred.&#13;
Pilot Land Management Component&#13;
4.11    Microcatchments (MCs) have been identified during project preparation. In view of the varying&#13;
gradients, rainfall, and soil conditions in the hill country, a representative mix of MCs has been selected&#13;
for this pilot to test appropriate technologies and treatments. Project implementation would be through&#13;
an interactive planning process (see Annex 4 for details), whereby implementing agencies work together&#13;
with beneficiaries to prepare and implement a plan for the MC. Villagers, backed by technical advice&#13;
provided by the Field Extension Team,"' would select site specific interventions as appropriate.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that (i) five MC plans, sufficient for the first year's project&#13;
implementation and approved by the Provincial Steering Committee (PSC),12 would be prepared no later&#13;
than September 30, 1997, (ii) five more such plans sufficient for the second year's project implementation&#13;
would be prepared no later than April 30, 1998; all such plans to be satisfactory to IDA (para. 6.1 (k)).&#13;
4.12    The MAL&amp;F would be responsible for the execution of the pilot activities in close consultation&#13;
and collaboration with MTEWA, the Department of Agriculture (DOA), and the Provincial Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture (PDA) (see Annex 8, Chart 7). There would be a sub-Committee (Land Steering Committee&#13;
[LSC]) of the SC, chaired by the Secretary MAL&amp;F to review progress of the land component. At the&#13;
provincial level, the NRMC and PDA in close consultation with and assistance from LUPPD and the PSC&#13;
would be responsible for the implementation of the pilot activities. The PSC would be served by the&#13;
Provincial Implementation Unit.13 Provincial implementation units would appoint MC planning teams.&#13;
MC would be the center piece of the organizational structure.  MC teams would be responsible for&#13;
coordination of MC fieldwork (joint interactive planning of selected treatments options). MC teams&#13;
would include the relevant Field Extension Team members (on a part-time basis), the provincial staff&#13;
assigned to the project, one additional catalyst/500 ha, and one additional senior catalyst per 10 catalysts&#13;
on a full-time basis. The project would provide for a Specialist in Natural Resources Management (NRM)&#13;
Field Extension Team comprising Agricultural Instructors (Al) from the Provincial Department of Agriculture&#13;
(Provincial DOA), AI from the Inter-provincial Schemes, Livestock Development Instructors, Extension Officers&#13;
from the Department of Export Agriculture, and the Coconut Development Officers from the Cultivation Board&#13;
have been established under the Second Agricultural Extension Project (Cr. 2380-CE).&#13;
12  PSC chaired by the Chief Secretary Provincial Council and comprising senior representatives of the MAL&amp;F&#13;
and MTEWA, the Director General Agriculture, and the Directors NRMC and LUPPD of the MAL&amp;F,&#13;
representatives of NGOs/Communities, and the private sector.&#13;
'3  The Provincial Implementation Unit (PIU) will consist of Provincial Director for Agriculture, the Provincial&#13;
Director of Animal Production and Health, the Divisional Secretary , a representative of a leading NGO, and a&#13;
representative of the fanning community, supplemented by technical personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
and an accountant. The NRM specialist would be posted in the Central Provincial Council and would be&#13;
responsible for the day-to-day implementation and operation of the component under the supervision of&#13;
the Chief Secretary Central Province, Provincial Council.&#13;
4.13    Conditions of Disbursement would be: (a) a Memorandum of Understanding, satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, between MTEWA, MAL&amp;F and Provincial Department of Agriculture (PDA) of the Central&#13;
Province shall have been concluded and entered into effect; (b) the LSC shall has been established; (c) the&#13;
Natural Resource Management Specialist and catalysts required for the first year's implementation&#13;
program have been recruited and (d) the standard 30 year lease agreement requiring lessees to carry out&#13;
land management practices satisfactory to the Forestry Department and IDA is in effect (para. 6.3). In&#13;
addition, assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOSL will ensure that its Forestry Department&#13;
extend the term of existing permit holders on reservations for a minimum period offive years subject to&#13;
the lessee carrying out the management practices stipulated (paras. 6.1 (1) and 6. 3).&#13;
4.14    Consultancies would be provided to the PDA to monitor the work relating to participatory land&#13;
use mapping and planning, and community group formation (user groups and farmer organization and in&#13;
participatory plan formulation). The appointment of the consultants would be a condition of Effectiveness&#13;
(para. 4.16 &amp; 6.2 (a)). Formal training organized by the Human Resources Development Center of the&#13;
DOA with the assistance of the NRMC and the PDA would be provided to the project team members and&#13;
catalysts at the Inservice Training Institute, Gannorouwa.  The farmer training would be done in&#13;
community centers and District Training Centers in the Province.&#13;
4.15    Role of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). NGOs would be encouraged to participate in&#13;
project implementation. Because several NGOs have considerable experience with community&#13;
development, they could help in at least four ways: (i) by extending informal advice to staff from the line&#13;
agencies upon request; (ii) by conducting training courses for line agency staff, under contract, to teach&#13;
methods of participatory assessment in villages preferences; (iii) by designing and implementing, under&#13;
contract, systems for monitoring and evaluating baseline status and project progress; and (iv) by&#13;
implementing, under contract, a MC plan. NGOs are currently active in the project area and funds have&#13;
been specifically allocated for NGO assistance under the project budget.&#13;
C.     Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.16   The implementation schedule in Annex 4 shows the key events of project implementation. It&#13;
includes a time-bound detailed implementation plan (Tables 1-4) and an indication of the Project's&#13;
supervision requirements (Table 5). To ensure the timely start-up of the institutional strengthening&#13;
component the appointment of major consultancies is a condition of Effectiveness. To ensure timely start&#13;
of CEIF, media announcements calling for proposals and the appointment of the committee responsible&#13;
for the administration of the Facility have been made. Regarding the timely start of the implementation of&#13;
the land component, the appointment of consultants is a condition of Effectiveness. MC planning would&#13;
start soon after Credit Effectiveness. Concerning the supervision requirements, assurances were obtained&#13;
at Negotiations that two in-depth reviews would be jointly carried out by GOSL and IDA. The first&#13;
would be undertaken by September 30, 1998 and the second by June 30, 2000. Also, three third-party&#13;
supervisions would also be carried out during the life of the project (para 6.1 (m)).&#13;
D.     Monitoring&#13;
4.17   Indicators. The project would have a set of monitorable indicators to measure the degree of (i)&#13;
attainment of project objectives and (ii) efficiency of project implementation. A list of monitorable&#13;
indicators covering all project components, satisfactory to IDA, has been agreed with GOSL at&#13;
Negotiations (para. 6. 1 (n) and Annex 6). The list of indicators differentiates between input, process,&#13;
output, and impact indicators. ED, assisted by technical assistance, would be responsible for overall&#13;
project monitoring (para 3.6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
4.18    Manapement Information System. The project will support the establishment of a computer-&#13;
based Project Management Information System (PMIS). PMIS will be based on an integrated set of&#13;
personal computer software applications that will facilitate the management of financial, temporal, and&#13;
spatial information.14    ED, CEA, and NRMC  will be expected to establish such capabilities.&#13;
14  A typical software configuration for this purpose will include a computerized project management software such&#13;
as MicroSoft Project and a financial management package such as Quicken. In addition, a desktop Geographical&#13;
Information System (GIS) package such as ATLAS-GIS would be used for the land management component.&#13;
Alternatives configurations would also be considered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
5. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, AND RISKS&#13;
Overall Project Benefits.&#13;
5.1    The proposed project is the initial 5-year phase of an expected long-term program that would&#13;
assist Sri Lanka to meet its environmental challenges through proper institutional and policy changes, as&#13;
well as through investments in environmental protection and conservation activities at the local level.&#13;
Estimates during project preparation indicate that the annual costs of environmental degradation in just&#13;
four areas (soil, forests, energy, and coastal resources) amount to more than 2.5% of Sri Lanka's GNP.'5&#13;
These are the costs of inaction and provide an indication of the potential benefits to be drawn from&#13;
investments to address environmental problems. The order of magnitude of this degradation underscores&#13;
the urgency of corrective actions.   Policy actions, institutional strengthening and site-specific&#13;
rehabilitation activities should provide substantial benefits. These benefits would extend well beyond the&#13;
five-year project period.&#13;
5.2    The proposed project would put in place a process that would generate efficiency gains through&#13;
the improved allocation of resources for sustainable development. Specifically, the project would: (a) help&#13;
GOSL meet its environmental challenges by strengthening the policy formulation process and through&#13;
institutional, operational, and regulatory changes; (b) support more sustainable development through&#13;
integration of environmental objectives with broader development goals; (c) provide through institutional&#13;
strengthening a focal entity for environment policy, planning, and coordination and the institutional basis&#13;
for regulatory and enforcement activities; (d) provide health benefits especially in areas affected by&#13;
industrial and mining pollution through improved environmental monitoring and regulation; (e) improve&#13;
the productivity and income of small and marginal farmers and reduce reservoir siltation through cost-&#13;
effective land management in the hilly wet zone area; and (f) provide local communities through CEIF&#13;
with a facility to implement high priority environmental and conservation activities within NEAP.&#13;
5.3    Institutional strengthening and the policy reform component is by far the largest component in&#13;
the project. The benefits of this component are diffused and cannot be quantified. However, the&#13;
institutional strengthening approach supported by the project resulted from an economic analysis that&#13;
tested its low-cost characteristic as well as its financial sustainability (Annex 7). The benefits of the&#13;
proposed CEIF activities are unknown at this stage, but eligibility criteria, acceptable to IDA, will ensure&#13;
that these activities are economically efficient and financially sustainable (para 3.17). A quantitative&#13;
assessment of the land management component has been undertaken and the results of the analyses are&#13;
summarized below and included in detail as part of Annex 7. A brief qualitative description of benefits&#13;
for all components is presented in Table 5.1.&#13;
5  Sri Lanka: Environmental Action 1 Project, Project Preparation Report, Vol. 1, June 1994. A  recent report&#13;
published for the World Bank estimates annual environmental degradation to be around 10% and above&#13;
(reaching 17% in Nigeria) of GNP of developing countries. Pearce and Warford, 1993 World Without End,&#13;

NGO outreach program to increase mass&#13;
awareness; and develop an information reporting&#13;
system.&#13;
Policy Subcomponent              Help GOSL achieve sustainable development by&#13;
reviewing macro-and-sector policies that impact&#13;
on the environment; design instruments to capture&#13;
environmental externalities; and promote adoption&#13;
of 'Win-win" policies at the macro-level and&#13;
enforce regulations; and generate data needed for&#13;
the refinement of policy/economic instruments.&#13;
Community Environment Initiative   Improve management capacities at the local level&#13;
Facility                         and broaden  understanding  and  support for&#13;
environmental protection to improve the quality of&#13;
the environment for the urban and rural people.&#13;
Pilot Land Management Component  Reduce soil erosion and reservoir siltation; improve&#13;
hydrology; increase agricultural output; and&#13;
improve rural incomes. Develop and test models&#13;
for similar interventions in the future.&#13;
5.4    Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Pilot Land Management Component.  The land management&#13;
component is a pilot to test and develop on a watershed basis suitable land management practices for&#13;
minimizing the extent of land degradation. The component consists of on-farm and off-farm activities,&#13;
and accounts for only 15% of total project costs. This analysis applies only to the on-farm activities,&#13;
which is about 10% of the total project costs, and directly estimates on-farm benefits through increased&#13;
productivity. The analysis does not include externality benefits of on-farm activities nor the benefits and&#13;
costs of off-farm activities within the microwatershed. Benefits to farmers are expected to accrue as a&#13;
result of an increase in yields of existing crops due to improved land management practices such as&#13;
vegetative contour barriers, bank stabilization through vegetative measures, and stone terracing. These&#13;
practices result in the improvement of soil structure and improved retention of soil nutrients thereby&#13;
increasing soil fertility. The 'With" project case includes the management practices with all other factor&#13;
inputs remaining unchanged. Two farn models were analyzed 'With" and 'Without" these land&#13;
management practices to assess the impact of these measures on soil fertility. The farm models show a&#13;
substantial increase in farm income in the 'With" case due to introduction of these land management&#13;
practices. The results of farm budget analysis are given in Annex 7, Tables A7.2- 7.4. The overall&#13;
economic rate of return (ERR) of the proposed interventions to farmers in the pilot micro-watersheds is&#13;
16% in Model 1 and 28% in Model 2. The average weighted ERR is 24% (see Annex 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
5.5    Two major risks in this component are: (a) that there could be delays in adoption of soil&#13;
conservation techniques by farmers; and (b) productivity increases from improved soil practices may not&#13;
be fully realized (para. 5.11). Sensitivity analysis was carried out which shows that the ERR is robust&#13;
and not sensitive to delays in project benefits. For Model 1, a lag in benefits by two years would reduce&#13;
ERR to 10%. whereas for Model 2, a lag in benefits by 2 years would reduce the ERR to 20%. The&#13;
sensitivity analysis also shows that it is not sensitive to shortfalls in projected yields, hence decline in&#13;
projected benefits. A decline in benefits by 40% would reduce the ERR to 11% for Model I and 22% for&#13;
Model 2.&#13;
5.6    To test the sensitivity of component's ERRs to possible adverse outcomes, an analysis of&#13;
switching values of costs and benefits was carried out. The results indicate that if benefits decline by 30%&#13;
and 75% for Models 1 and 2, respectively, the ERR declines to 12% which is the opportunity cost of&#13;
capital. Costs would have to increase by 50% and 290% for the Models 1 and 2 respectively for the&#13;
ERR to decline to 12% (see Annex 7).&#13;
Fiscal Sustainabilitv&#13;
5.7    The only project component with a long-term impact on GOSL's budget is the institutional&#13;
strengthening component. Some expenditures introduced by the project would become part of GOSL's&#13;
ongoing recurrent cost after project completion. In both ED and CEA, the budgetary impact is significant&#13;
with current expenditures rising by 39% and 33%, respectively from 1996 to the end of the five-year&#13;
project. However, the incremental recurrent cost, in 1995 constant prices, by the end of the project is only&#13;
0.2% of MTEWA's budgeted expenditures in 1995 (see Annex 7). The IDA credit would finance&#13;
incremental costs on a declining basis, and it is expected that they would be compensated by the overall&#13;
gain in economic efficiency (e.g. through pollution abatement) due to the institutional strengthening under&#13;
the project. GOSL has also indicated a willingness to sustain the ED and CEA expenditures and&#13;
activities after completion of the project.&#13;
5.8    Options for the enhancement of the fiscal sustainability of the project include the following&#13;
measures: (a) overall fiscal adjustment would facilitate the government to engage in high priority areas,&#13;
such as the environment, where it has its comparative advantage; and (b) a freeze on new hiring in the&#13;
non-staff grades including positions currently unfilled would improve sustainability. However, stringent&#13;
budgetary conditions are likely to prevail over the next few years, which suggest that additional measures&#13;
are necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability. As part of the project, provision is made for technical&#13;
assistance in the first project year to undertake a study of the license fee structure with a view to&#13;
improving cost-recovery. The recommendations of this study would be jointly discussed by IDA and&#13;
GOSL, and an action plan would be implemented (para. 3.8). Preliminary analysis indicates that modest&#13;
increases in the current fee structure could offset the increased recurrent expenditure resulting from the&#13;
project (see Annex 4, paras 23-24 and Annex 7, Table A7. 1).&#13;
Risks&#13;
5.9    Human Resources. The institutional component of the project would largely depend in the longer&#13;
term on addressing the underlying problems that have made it difficult to recruit and retain highly&#13;
qualified staff. The problems of low compensation package for high-level civil servants and a high ratio&#13;
of support to high-level staff are key issues to be addressed, and these are being taken up as a generic&#13;
issue in the GOSL-Bank dialogue on public sector reform, and in the case of environmental institutions,&#13;
under technical assistance provided under the project. A study undertaken in year 1 of the project would&#13;
lead to the preparation and subsequent implementation of an action plan to provide better incentives&#13;
systems to permit well-trained technical staff to be recruited and retained by CEA (para. 3.8).&#13;
5.10    Complexity of Stakeholder Composition.   The policy agenda required for sustainable&#13;
development needs to be defined with a view to arriving at a broad consensus among a widely diverse set&#13;
of stakeholders. The project cuts across many sectors, and consensus building on enviromnental policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
implementation among line agencies, NGOs, and communities is a complex task. Project design has&#13;
attempted to reduce this risk in the following ways: (a) clearly defining the roles of MTEWA/ED and&#13;
CEA in policy planning and enforcement, with line agencies still playing a major role in implementing&#13;
sector strategies; (b) utilizing existing institutions rather than creating new ones; (c) encouraging&#13;
beneficiary participation with long-term measures such as the establishment of an outreach MTEWA/ED&#13;
staff position, and in the short term, using participatory mechanisms for the land and CEIF components;&#13;
(d) undertaking studies in areas where there is a need to clarify the links between economy-wide and&#13;
sector-wide policies and the environment; and (e) reviewing and updating annually the policy reform&#13;
agenda with IDA and other donors.&#13;
5.11    Pilot Land Management Component. Two major risks in the land management component are:&#13;
(a) that there could be delays in adoption of the soil conservation techniques by the farmers; and&#13;
(b) productivity increases from improved soil practices may not be fully realized. These would be&#13;
addressed by providing mass awareness campaigns and farmer education programs as well as evaluating&#13;
the long-term sustainability of the land treatments. While such efforts have been made in neighboring&#13;
Asian countries, the longer-term feasibility of such measures needs to be studied in greater depth in the&#13;
hill country context of Sri Lanka. This would be addressed by providing for a baseline study and follow-&#13;
up surveys over the life of the project, various demonstrations to test the technology, and by introducing a&#13;
beneficiary participation approach. The proposed component represents a step in an important learning&#13;
process and should generate important awareness of both the problems and possible solutions.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION 1 PROJECT&#13;
THE PROJECT'S LINK TO BANK'S STRATEGIES&#13;
World Bank Environmental Strategv&#13;
1.   This first-stage project is in line with the on-going 'third generation" environmental activities&#13;
sustained by the World Bank and its member countries.  As described in the recent report on&#13;
Mainstreaming the Environment: The World Bank Group and the Environment since the Rio Earth&#13;
Summit (FY 1995), this third generation of activities has as its principal areas of emphasis: (i) on-the-&#13;
ground implementation; (ii) incorporating environment into sectoral and national strategies --upstream of&#13;
project work; and (iii) a stronger focus on people participation in devising and implementing&#13;
environmental management strategies.   The principal component of this project (institutional&#13;
strengthening) would lead to the internalization of a planning and priority-setting mechanism integrating&#13;
economic and environmental concerns as well as increased capacity for on-the-ground enforcement of&#13;
environmental regulations. The other two components (community environmental improvement fund and&#13;
pilot land management) will also promote concrete environmental improvement management but with&#13;
special emphasis on the demonstration of effective people participation, third area of thrust of Bank&#13;
environmental work. In addition to being in line with these global trends of Bank work, the project fits in&#13;
the overall country assistance strategy followed by the Bank in Sri Lanka.&#13;
Country Assistance Stratef&#13;
2.   The World Bank Group's country assistance strategy for Sri Lanka' is designed to help Sri Lanka&#13;
realize its goal of economic growth and poverty reduction comparable to that of its more prosperous East&#13;
Asian neighbours. Balancing environment protection with the promotion of private sector-led growth is&#13;
central to this strategy. Principal Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) priorities and their impact on&#13;
project design are summarized hereafter, as well as the linkages between project components and selected&#13;
on-going Bank projects.&#13;
3.   Improved Fiscal Discipline. To support the growth objective, Bank Group efforts concentrate on:&#13;
fiscal restraint, civil service restructuring, higher operations and maintenance expenditures--offset by&#13;
increased user charges, more rapid reduction in losses of public enterprises through accelerated&#13;
privatization, and efficiency gains from reform of large enterprises, and the elimination of unproductive&#13;
subsidies; and support to the devolution process.&#13;
4.   Private Sector Development. Bank Group efforts aim at: providing a conducive institutional and&#13;
policy framework for private investment and for public investment in infrastructure, stimulating a supply&#13;
response, and ensuring that growth will not be at the expense of the natural environment or the quality of&#13;
urban life. The Bank Group also emphasizes the need to address the key requirements for private sector&#13;
growth. These are: (a) diversification and productivity growth in the agricultural sector; (b) deepening of&#13;
the financial sector; (c) private sector investment in infrastructure; and (d) environment safeguards.&#13;
5.   Building Up Human Capital. To address the poverty reduction objective, the Bank Group's&#13;
approach highlights creating jobs and raising rural incomes by improving the environment for private&#13;
sector growth, particularly in agriculture.&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy, May 21, 1996&#13;

6.   Policy Dialogue. The Bank and the government have jointly prepared a comprehensive reform&#13;
agenda, 'Sri Lanka in the Year 2000" which provides a foundation for the policy dialogue. The&#13;
government intends to use this document to strengthen on-going dialogue with interested parties on&#13;
economic issues.&#13;
7.   Proiect Links to Bank Group's Strategy. The Bank Group's work in Sri Lanka reinforces the&#13;
government's conviction that growth must not be at the expense of the natural environment or the quality&#13;
of urban life. This project fits into the Bank Group's CAS as it would strengthen the institutional and&#13;
policy framework for environmental management leading to cost-effective and fiscally sustainable&#13;
improvement in selective areas of environmental policy making and enforcement that belong in the&#13;
private sector, while promoting the contracting out of environmental services currently undertaken by the&#13;
public sector. Some of the critical problems of environmental institutions in Sri Lanka (inadequate entry&#13;
standards, low pay, and low morale) are issues that are not unique to this sector and will be addressed by&#13;
the stand-alone civil service reform work that is at the heart of the CAS agenda on redefinition of the&#13;
public sector. While the project will apply Bank experience in environmental institution development, it&#13;
will maintain enough flexibility in project implementation for the application of relevant&#13;
recommendations of overall public sector reform as the above stand-alone work progresses. The project&#13;
would help update the NEAP and bolster the capacities of the lines agencies to build environmental&#13;
considerations into their planning and project development. The project will also establish and support&#13;
sustainable mechanisms of coordination between NGOs, public and private sector entities and external&#13;
donors in addressing policy and investment issues for the promotion of environmental management.&#13;
8.   The project will contribute to increased transfer of responsibility to the private sector by contracting&#13;
out certain activities in the EIA and licensing processes, while keeping overall control in the public sector.&#13;
This objective will complement the environmental laboratory, privatization program supported under the&#13;
on-going Private Finance Development Project (PFDP). In terms of policy dialogue, the Policy Letter and&#13;
the Policy Action Plan supported by the project will assist the government in reviewing macro- and sector-&#13;
wide policies with impact on the environment. The objective of the policy letter is to spell out the&#13;
institutional and legal changes and broadly set out the policy changes required for sound environmental&#13;
management. Moreover, the policy letter would serve as a vehicle for updating the needed measures as&#13;
well as a framework for the dialogue with donors. The project will also continue the investigation of&#13;
economic policy-environment linkages in view of the promotion of market-driven interventions for&#13;
environmental management. On the more specific issue of CAS support to GOSL's devolution of powers,&#13;
both the CEIF and the land management components will demonstrate increased involvement of&#13;
provincial governments in on-the-ground implementation of environmental activities.&#13;
9.   Finally, the project will complement on-going Bank-supported projects such as the Colombo&#13;
Environment Improvement Project (by strengthening the legal and institutional framework of pollution&#13;
regulation enforcement, and by investigating models of market-driven mechanisms for the enforcement of&#13;
environmental standards); and the Forest Sector Development Project (e.g., by supporting, through the&#13;
land management pilot, a system for ensuring that the transfer of land to farmers will lead to a more&#13;
sustainable and efficient use of rapidly degrading land resources).&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION 1 PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
I.     The Project&#13;
A.     Summary of Project Scope and Obiectives&#13;
1.     The primary objective of the proposed project is to assist GOSL in strengthening the institutional&#13;
and policy framework for environmental management within which the Bank and other donors would&#13;
provide assistance in the environmental sector.  In particular, the project would  (i) support the&#13;
government's strategy of restructuring MTEWA's ED and strengthening CEA to carry out its analytical&#13;
as well as enforcement and monitoring responsibilities; (ii) support an ongoing effort to internalize&#13;
enviromnental considerations into the overall development planning process; and (iii) help GOSL take&#13;
immediate remedial measures to reverse the trend of environmental degradation through pilot programs of&#13;
participatory approaches to environmental management.&#13;
B.     Summag Project Description&#13;
2.     The project would comprise three major components: (a) Institutional Strengthening (US$12.5&#13;
million) for: (i) restructuring ED within MTEWA to allow it to play a central role in environmental&#13;
policy, planning and coordination at the national level; (ii) restructuring and strengthening CEA through&#13;
establishment and implementation of a staff development program, enhancement of the Industrial&#13;
Licensing and Inspection Program, development of environmental codes of practice for small industries,&#13;
improvement of capacity for EIA, and strengthening of the environmental information system; (iii)&#13;
provision of office and technical facilities to accommodate both ED and CEA. A detailed staffing plan for&#13;
restructuring ED and strengthening CEA has been agreed upon with MTEWA. Financing of the above&#13;
would include incremental staff, training, consultancy, vehicles, civil work, and equipment; and (iv) a&#13;
policy subcomponent that would include studies of the linkages between sector and economy-wide policies&#13;
and the environment. This subcomponent would also support an annual review of the environmental&#13;
implications of the PIP and an update of the NEAP. Finally, it would include a policy letter and a policy&#13;
action plan that would broadly define legal, institutional, and policy changes that are required for sound&#13;
environmental management. Formal covenants, however, would only be directly related to the proposed&#13;
project; (b) a Community Environmental Initiatives Facilitv (CEIF) (US$4.7 million) would be set up to&#13;
finance well-planned environmental activities at the grass-roots level within the priority NEAP/PIP&#13;
sectors (other donors could also contribute). CEIF would provide a mechanism for pooling resources and&#13;
is a vehicle for private sector and NGO participation and for decentralizing environmental activities; and&#13;
(c) a Pilot Land Management Component (US$ 3.5 million). Major emphasis would be on pilot areas of&#13;
degraded land for rehabilitation with community participation..&#13;
C.    Detailed Project Description&#13;
Institutional Strenathenin¢&#13;
3.     Environment Division of MTEWA. The ED of MTEWA would be restructured under the existing&#13;
two Additional Secretary positions. One Additional Secretary would be responsible for development of&#13;
environmental policies and programs through small professional Directorates focused on a range of&#13;
environmental sectors; the other would be responsible for administration of the ED and for monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of the extent to which national environmental policy is being effectively implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 18&#13;
The project would support an increase of the cadre of professional and technical officers from the present&#13;
level of 12 to 30 (Fig. 1).&#13;
4.     The ED is proposed to operate under the direction of two Additional Secretaries reporting to the&#13;
Secretary in relation to policy and program development issues and coordination, monitoring, and&#13;
management issues, respectively. Directors under the Additional Secretary for Policy and Planning will&#13;
take responsibility for the formulation of national environmental policy and the development of programs&#13;
for policy implementation in natural resource management, international environmental issues, industrial&#13;
pollution prevention and control, environmental issues related to urban settlements, and legal matters,&#13;
respectively. Each will be supported by one or two staff at the Deputy or Assistant Director level. It is&#13;
expected that this small but professionally strong group would develop environmental policy and&#13;
programs by means of coordinating and leading task-oriented working groups of officers from&#13;
implementing agencies assisted by appropriate specialists and consultants where necessary.&#13;

5.     Under the Additional Secretary (Management), there would be two additional positions. The&#13;
Senior Assistant Secretary would manage administration and financial matters, and a Director of Co-&#13;
ordination and Monitoring would be responsible for facilitating inter-ministry cooperation in the&#13;
development of policy and for monitoring the extent to which environmental policy is being adequately&#13;
implemented by other ministries and agencies.&#13;
6.     Central Environmental Authority. CEA would be restructured into three Divisions, each under a&#13;
Deputy Director General. This action should lead to a stronger management structure as well as providing&#13;
clearer career path opportunities for staff of the agency. The two core functions of the CEA are the&#13;
environmental assessment of new proposals and the control and prevention of pollution from existing&#13;
activities. These functions both involve two major tasks: pre-operational assessment and post-operational&#13;
enforcement. These two tasks will be integrated under one Deputy Director General (DDG2) for&#13;
pollution control matters and under a second Deputy Director General (DDGI) for the management and&#13;
evaluation of environmental impact assessment. The latter DDG will also be responsible for a small&#13;
research and project management group. The third DDG will be responsible for the environmental&#13;
promotion and public awareness program together with the administrative and financial functions.&#13;
Included in this functional area is a need for immediate development of a strong human resource&#13;
management ability to manage the recruitment of professional and technical staff, initially to fill existing&#13;
vacancies and thereafter to increase the staffing level to that necessary for the CEA to effectively carry out&#13;
its functions. Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 summarize the organizational structure. Professional and technical&#13;
staff down to Level VI are shown for the existing approved cadre, the staff currently in situ and the&#13;
recruiting requirements for each of the years 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999; and the resultant 1999 cadre.&#13;
7.     Future regional offices will report directly to the Director General. Regional offices would be&#13;
expected to carry out a broad range of environmental tasks and will need day-to-day management. There&#13;
will also be a need to manage the issue of transition of these offices to provincial administration under the&#13;
devolution process. Therefore, a Director will be appointed to manage the development and operation of&#13;
the Regional Offices; the legal section of the agency will be placed under the Director General since they&#13;
will provide services across all activities of the agency. Figure 2 shows these relationships along with a&#13;
summary of the agency staff requirements.&#13;

8.     It is expected that considerable efficiency gains should be available through effective feedback&#13;
between the assessment and enforcement tasks. On the one hand a clear understanding of the reasons for&#13;
some constraint being placed on an industry will enable the enforcement officer to tailor the enforcement&#13;
strategy to the importance of the issue. On the other hand, an understanding of the problems facing an&#13;
enforcement officer will be invaluable in ensuring enforceable conditions are forged during the assessment&#13;
process. Therefore under the project, the assessment and enforcement functions will be maintained within&#13;
Directorates dealing with pollution control and environmental assessment respectively (Figure 3).&#13;
9.     Although industry has a major role in monitoring discharges to the environment and the impact&#13;
of these discharges, there is a role for a government agency in monitoring the impact of non-point source&#13;
discharges such as urban and agricultural runoff, motor vehicles, and domestic fires.   Much of the&#13;
precise analysis and routine work can be contracted out but the CEA needs to maintain a capacity for&#13;
critical assessment of work undertaken by others and an ability to undertake preliminary analyses to&#13;
determine if a likely problem exists. This is best achieved by having a small group who can maintain&#13;
competence in the discipline with access to a limited range of laboratory facilities (see Laboratory Services&#13;
in Figure 3). The equipment already held, or in process of acquisition by the CEA, is adequate for this&#13;
purpose. Equipment for a moderate urban air quality monitoring program is to be provided under the&#13;
Colombo Urban Transport Project, but staff to support the operation and maintenance of the equipment&#13;
are included in this Division.&#13;

10.    Recruitment of staff to this division should emphasize the requirement for qualifications and&#13;
experience relevant to industrial processes and pollution control such as industrial chemistry, chemical,&#13;
wastewater, or environmental engineering and environmental science. As far as is possible, emphasis&#13;
should be placed on qualifications that include significant content dealing with industrial pollution&#13;
control.&#13;

11.    The process of environmental impact assessment from initiation to the enforcement of conditions&#13;
of approval is the core activity of this Division. It is recognized, however, that for many of the projects&#13;
undergoing EIA the industrial expertise of officers from the Pollution Control Directorates will be&#13;
invaluable.  It is therefore anticipated that appropriate officers will form task teams to assist in&#13;
assessments. Where a proposal or part of a proposal approved through the EIA process also requires&#13;
environmental protection licensing, then staff of the Pollution Control Directorates would be expected to&#13;
undertake ongoing inspection and enforcement. Staff of EIA Directorate would monitor and enforce the&#13;
"non-industrial" aspects of the conditions of approval.&#13;
12.    Other activities that can sensibly be accommodated in this Division are the management of&#13;
externally funded projects such as the wetlands project funded through aid from the Netherlands&#13;
Government and a small research group that would include responsibility for development of an&#13;
environmental information system. Provision has also been made for the creation of a small group&#13;
responsible for overseeing the proper management of industrial solid and hazardous wastes.&#13;

13.    The administrative and financial management of the CEA will be the responsibility of Deputy&#13;
Director General 3 (see Fig. 5). Two important new initiatives are proposed to be included in this&#13;
Division. A small Human Resource Development directorate is proposed to improve the management of&#13;

staff recniitment and to develop and manage the implementation of programs and proposals aimed at&#13;
providing greater incentives for recruitment and retention of staff and in the longer term to assist local&#13;
and provincial authorities in recruitment and training of appropriate environmental staff. It is essential&#13;
that these positions be filled as soon as possible as their first task will be to manage the recruitment of&#13;
staff to fill the existing CEA vacancies.&#13;
14.    A unit would also be established to deal with the approximately 300 complaints directed to the&#13;
CEA each month. Most of these complaints should and can be dealt with by Local Authorities, and the&#13;
proposed unit would make preliminary investigation of complaints, administer the redirection of&#13;
complaints to Local Authorities or the CEA's Pollution Control Directorates, follow-up with Local&#13;
Authorities, and issue Directions to Local Authorities where necessary. Effective operation of this unit,&#13;
combined with improved public awareness of the Local Authorities' enviromnental responsibilities should&#13;
enable a reduction in staff resources within two or three years. By this time these staff will be famniliar&#13;
with a wide range of environmental issues and can be transferred to the EIA or Pollution Control&#13;
Directorates to deal with the expected increasing workload.&#13;

Contracting Out of Services&#13;
16.    Many of the tasks traditionally undertaken by environmental protection agencies are open to&#13;
consideration for contracting out services.  In approximate order of increasing complexity of the&#13;
contracting-out process, these tasks include:&#13;
(i)   evaluation of EIA and IEE reports;&#13;
(ii)  environmental and industrial sampling and analysis;&#13;
(iii)  regular inspection of licensed premises;&#13;
(iv)  assessment of license applications and setting of license conditions;&#13;
(v)   compliance audit of licenses;&#13;
(vi)  industry site evaluation;&#13;
(vii) response to pollution complaints; and&#13;
(viii) gathering of evidence for prosecutions.&#13;
17.    However, it needs to be clearly recognized that in contracting out such services, the contractor is&#13;
not being asked to make decisions that are rightly the province of the CEA. The contractor should&#13;
undertake appropriate investigations and provide the CEA with advice. Such advice may take the form,&#13;
for instance, of a detailed set of license conditions, but the final decision on what conditions are placed on&#13;
a license rests with the CEA.&#13;
18.    For all the above tasks except item (i), the contractor would need statutory powers to enter&#13;
property. These powers are provided for in section 24A of the National Environmental Act in relation to&#13;
duly authorized officers but is unlikely to be able to be extended to contractors. However, section 101 (3)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 11 of 18&#13;
of the proposed National Environmental Protection Act' makes adequate provision for the appointment of&#13;
contractors as inspectors.&#13;
19.    Figure 7 provides an indication of the likely effects on the resources needed by CEA that might&#13;
be brought about by various levels of contracting out services. The figures are based on task levels&#13;
expected in 1997.&#13;

20.    The project would provide technical assistance for a contract undertaking industry inspections&#13;
and drafting of licenses for a representative district of Colombo. This would be a pilot program for&#13;
evaluating the feasibility of contracting out such services on a larger scale.&#13;
Revenue Generation&#13;
21.    In addition to being a mechanism for controlling the potentially polluting activities of industries,&#13;
the licensing of industries generates revenue. The CEA currently receives about Rs5 million in fees from&#13;
about 2000 licensed premises - an average of about Rs2500 per year from each licensed premises. There&#13;
is scope for increasing this revenue on the basis of two principles: the cost of regulation should be borne&#13;
most by those requiring most attention; and those requiring to use the environment for discharge and&#13;
dispersion of wastes should be charged for such use.&#13;
22.    Some work has already been undertaken to develop a load-based fee structure in respect of&#13;
wastewater discharges. Further technical assistance is provided under the project to develop the detail of&#13;
an extensive load-based licensing system, initially for liquid effluents and potentially for other wastes. The&#13;
TOR for the technical assistance should include a requirement to determine a scheme of fees that will&#13;
raise sufficient revenue to cover the full costs of the current and future pollution control activities of the&#13;
CEA and local and provincial authorities.&#13;

Policy Subcomponent&#13;
23.    The objective of the policy component is to develop and institutionalize a framework for the&#13;
consideration of economic-environmental linkages in Sri Lanka. Toward this end, the component will&#13;
support: (i) studies to further analyze the policy implications of economic-environmental linkages at the&#13;
macro- and sector-specific levels. Box 1 provides a list of studies that were identified during project&#13;
preparation; (ii) dissemination of reports on the State of Sri Lanka's Environment and an update of the&#13;
NEAP; and (iii) workshops to reinforce broad ownership and improve adherence to sound environmental&#13;
principles, with participation of government representatives and other concerned stakeholders.&#13;
Box 1. Studies&#13;
1.  Provide detailed, historical analysis of economic and regulatory factors affecting incentives&#13;
for resource use. These factors should include direct sectoral policies or regulations, as well&#13;
as possible indirect determinants of sectoral incentives. This should augment the existing&#13;
work based on the Action Impact Matrix used for project formulation.&#13;
2.  Undertake empirical, quantitative assessment of incentives distortions.&#13;
3.  Analyze potential contribution and costs of alternatives policy reform measures.&#13;
4.  Continue implementation of the Decision Support System pollution model for specific&#13;
industries and for key pollution 'hot spots"&#13;
5.  Joint MTEWA/NPD studies on environmental issues associated with development strategies&#13;
on growth patters anticipated by forward looking strategies such as "Sri Lanka 2000"&#13;
6.  Study to identify policy and technical options to conserve groundwater.&#13;
7.  Study to assess environmental effects of agricultural pricing policy.&#13;
8.  Study to recommend ways to focus public sector resources for biodiversity protection by&#13;
encouraging private sector provision of services in protected areas.&#13;
9.  Study to recommend policy options to control plastic waste.&#13;
10. Study to recommend policies to promote markets for waste recycling.&#13;
11. Study to recommend incentives for non-coral based lime.&#13;
12. Recommendations of fiscal incentives to promote renewable energy.&#13;
13. Policy options for introducing unleaded petrol and low sulfur diesel.&#13;
14. Study to recommend more effective performance bonds for the mining industry.&#13;
15. Review of ways to target the fertilizer subsidy to small farmers and reduce its environmental&#13;
consequences.&#13;
24.    Monitoring of Policy Agenda. A Policy Letter and a time-bound Policy Action Plan will assist&#13;
the government in reviewing macro- and sector-wide policies with impact on the environment. The policy&#13;
letter spells out the institutional and legal changes and broadly sets out the policy changes required for&#13;
sound environmental management. Moreover, the policy letter would serve as a vehicle for updating the&#13;
needed measures as well as a framework for the dialogue with donors. A Policy Action Plan, satisfactory&#13;
to IDA, is included in Annex 2. These policies would form an integral part of the ongoing IDA-assisted&#13;
projects and the joint Policy Framework Paper (PFP) dialogue with the government.&#13;
Pilot Land Management Component&#13;
25.    Soil erosion, deforestation, and other forms of watershed degradation endanger not only the&#13;
future productivity of the agricultural uplands but also the sustainability of Sri Lanka's huge investment in&#13;
hydropower, irrigation, and agricultural resettlement programs. This component is designed to use&#13;
available land use information to identify heavily degraded soils in the Central Province and addresses on&#13;
a pilot basis some of the most pressing problems with a view to finding approaches to minimize the&#13;
adverse effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 13 of 18&#13;
26.     The objectives would be to (i) test and develop on a watershed basis suitable technologies for&#13;
minimizing the extent of land degradation, thereby increasing agricultural productivity as well as&#13;
reducing the risk of erosion and its associated on-farm and off-farm impacts; (ii) examine feasibility of&#13;
participatory management of microwatersheds by the beneficiaries; (iii) define technical criteria and&#13;
investment criteria useful in replicating watershed development activities in other hilly areas.&#13;
27.     The pilot activities would be carried out in the hilly wet zone area of Sri Lanka's mid- and upper&#13;
country of the Central Province.    They would cover an area of about 10 representatives in&#13;
microwatersheds (600 to 1,000 ha each) selected in sub-watersheds so as to cover a optimal range of&#13;
micro-agroecological environment (with varying rainfall, slope and soil conditions).  Project success&#13;
criteria would, however, not be based on physical targets but on the development and adoption of&#13;
appropriate site-specific strategies, techniques, and treatments to address land degradation. The project&#13;
adopts a holistic approach and uses a participatory approach to involve both local populations and&#13;
government officials from the planning stage through implementation and assessment of project results.&#13;
The project would cover activities on the farmer's field, on communal lands, and on state lands within the&#13;
microwatersheds. Key elements of the project strategy focus on stabilizing upland farming by increased&#13;
control on resources.&#13;
28.     The proposed on-farm treatments should ensure flexibility to tailor the proven treatments to the&#13;
specific characteristics of the watersheds. Flexibility should include not only the adoption of site specific&#13;
measures to cover a wide range of micro-ecological environments but also the prospect of a combination&#13;
of, where appropriate and possible, both vegetative and limited engineering solutions. The proposed&#13;
treatments would seek to combine affordable, simple, and replicable technologies with greater reliance on&#13;
contour cultivation, in situ moisture conservation, and vegetative contour hedges/strips (porous barriers)&#13;
with short-term income generating goals suitable to the small size of the average land holdings (under 1&#13;
ha per farm family). The range of interventions would incorporate elements of the Sloping Agricultural&#13;
Land Technology (SALT) by encouraging the planting of leguminous shrubs, grasses (including vetiver),&#13;
and tree crops along the bunds of existing terraces or along contours in unterraced lands. These soil&#13;
stabilization and moisture retention treatments would complement mixed farming systems of food crops,&#13;
fruit and timber tress, and estate crops. Farmers would be provided with technical advise and limited&#13;
purchased inputs, with major emphasis being on proven labor intensive techniques and low-cost&#13;
treatments, with the farmer contributing his labor as a major input.&#13;
29.     Treatments on non-arable land (range lands, wastelands, degraded forests) and natural drainage's&#13;
courses would include treatments such as vegetative fencing, stabilization through vegetative contour&#13;
barriers, contour furrowing, diversion drains, gully control and bank stabilization through vegetative&#13;
measures, storage, and management of runoff in natural depressions/partially dug out structures with low&#13;
dams to promote the recharge of groundwater, and decongest blocked drainage lines. To support these&#13;
works, the project would provide funds to meet the costs of land use mapping, land use planning, crop&#13;
inputs, seedlings, vegetative and mechanical treatments, demonstration plots, mass awareness, training,&#13;
vehicles, equipment, consultancy services, incremental staff, and operating costs.&#13;

II.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Community Environment Initiatives Facility&#13;
30.    Administration. MTEWA would be responsible for the administration of the facility. Through&#13;
media announcements, MTEWA would call for proposals from local government agencies, NGOs,&#13;
community groups, and research organizations on an annual basis. MTEWA would select a consultant&#13;
firm in accordance with IDA guidelines for the purpose of appraising and evaluating all proposals&#13;
received by MTEWA. The selected firm would have professional and technical staff including a Natural&#13;
Resource Management Specialist, and an Urban/Industrial Specialist for the purpose of appraising and&#13;
evaluating all the proposals received by MTEWA. The firm would take into consideration technical and&#13;
financial aspects as well as eligibility and selection criteria. Media announcements calling for proposals&#13;
and the selection of consultants for review of proposals would be a condition of Board Presentation.&#13;
31.    A Committee would be responsible for administration and management of the facility. The&#13;
Committee would comprise of the Secretary, MTEWA (Chairman), Secretary, Finance, one NGO&#13;
representative of NGOs involved in environment and conservation, one representative from research or&#13;
the academic community with interest in environmental issues, and one representative from the private&#13;
sector. The last three named shall be appointed by the Minister, MTEWA, through a transparent selection&#13;
process for a period of one year. All proposals received by MTEWA would be evaluated by the consultants&#13;
and would be submitted to the Committee with a recommendation of acceptance/rejection and a priority&#13;
listing of proposals. The Committee would make the decision on funding after IDA review of the selected&#13;
proposals. After a decision was made on funding, a would be prepared by MTEWA providing details of&#13;
successful proposals and the basis for selection; copies will be sent to all applicants. The Environment&#13;
Division of MTEWA would be responsible for the overall coordination and would prepare a manual prior&#13;
to commencement that would outline the procedures to be followed in operation of the Facility and&#13;
guidelines to applicants. A summary outline of the contents of the manual has been agreed and supplied&#13;
to MTEWA. Preparation of the manual, including a draft participation agreement between MTEWA and&#13;
the participatory organization (see below), would be a condition of negotiations. Appointment of the&#13;
Committee would be a condition of Board Presentation.&#13;
32.   Implementation. The local government authorities, NGOs, and community groups would identify,&#13;
prepare, implement, and manage the subprojects. In order to be eligible, organizations should (i) be a&#13;
legal entity; (ii) have at least three years of experience dealing with environmental issues; (iii) be&#13;
experienced in organizing and assisting community groups; and (iv) have adequate administrative and&#13;
financial capacity to undertake the activity. An Agreement would be entered into between MTEWA and&#13;
the participatory organization. The implementing agencies would be the owners of the local subprojects&#13;
from the start, and therefore fully responsible for the operation and maintenance in accordance with&#13;
agreed financial and reporting procedures. The local government and line agencies would contribute 20%&#13;
of the subproject cost. The subprojects involving local communities and NGOs would include a minimum&#13;
beneficiary contribution of 20% as labor, material, or cash.&#13;
33.    Monitoring and Supervision. All activities funded out of CEIF will be reviewed and evaluated on&#13;
a semiannual basis. MTEWA would appoint a firm of consultants in accordance with IDA guidelines to&#13;
review progress, undertake an evaluation, and prepare a progress report on a semiannual basis.&#13;
Monitoring would be the responsibility of a Citizens Panel comprising of five representatives. Two&#13;
representatives from GOSL, (one from MTEWA and the other from Ministry of Finance/Planning), one&#13;
environment-related NGO representative, one private sector representative, and one representative from&#13;
a research institution and/or universities. The panel would be appointed by the Minister, MTEWA,&#13;
through a transparent selection process and will meet twice a year to review progress and evaluate reports&#13;
prepared by independent consultants appointed for the purpose. Funding of the consultants' evaluation&#13;
would be met out of the project. The Panel would review the reports of the consultants and make&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 15 of 18&#13;
recommendations, if any, to the Secretary, MTEWA, with a copy to IDA. Copies of the monitoring and&#13;
progress report of the consultants would also be sent to each of the agencies participating in the facility.&#13;
34.    Accounts. For the first year a block allocation of the equivalent of US$0.2 million has been&#13;
made by GOSL through budgetary sources into the sub-account maintained by MTEWA. Budgetary&#13;
provision for the Facility would be a condition of effectiveness. IDA would replenish the Facility upon&#13;
submission of a withdrawal application. GOSL would contribute a further US$0.5 million twelve months&#13;
later, and the IDA contribution would be US$2.37 million. Other donors would also be invited to&#13;
contribute to the Fund. IDA replenishment of the fund would be reviewed following a mid-term&#13;
evaluation. In order to monitor the performance of the project-financed grants and ensure they are utilized&#13;
for the intended purposes, the implementing agencies would be required to maintain separate accounts for&#13;
the funds received and expenditures incurred. These accounts of individual recipients would be subject to&#13;
audit by a recognized firm of auditors. MTEWA would prepare a consolidated statement of the accounts&#13;
and incorporate the receipts and expenditures, including funds received from donors, and prepare periodic&#13;
reports including the overall progress of the subprojects.&#13;
Pilot Land Management Component&#13;
35.    Microcatchments (MCs) have been identified during project preparation. In view of the varying&#13;
gradients, rainfall, and soil conditions in the hill country, a representative mix of MCs have been selected&#13;
for this pilot to test appropriate technology and treatments. Project implementation would be through an&#13;
interactive planning process, whereby implementing agencies work together with villagers to prepare and&#13;
implement a plan across a microcatchment. Villagers, backed by technical advise provided by the Field&#13;
Extension Team,2 would select from a menu of interventions that are appropriate to the site. Five MC&#13;
plans sufficient for the first year's project implementation and approved by the Provincial Steering&#13;
Committee (PSC) would be prepared no later than September 30, 1997. Five other MCs plans sufficient&#13;
for the second year's project implementation would be prepared no later than April 30, 1998. The forms&#13;
and content of the MCs plans would be reviewed and approved by IDA.&#13;
36.    Central Level. The project uses the strength of existing institutions. The MAL&amp;F would be&#13;
responsible for the execution of the pilot activities in close consultation and collaboration with the&#13;
MTEWA, the Department of Agriculture (DOA), the Provincial Council, and the Provincial Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture (PDA). The Secretary, MAL&amp;F, would be IDA's main contact regarding implementation of&#13;
the land management component. He would be assisted by the existing Project Directors Office within&#13;
MAL&amp;F in Colombo and by the Director, Natural Resources Management Center (NRMC). There would&#13;
be a sub-Committee (Land Steering Committee [LSC]) of the SC, chaired by the Secretary, MAL&amp;F, to&#13;
review progress of the project. LSC will include the Secretary, MTEWA, Chief Secretary, and Secretary of&#13;
Agriculture (Central Province), Director General Agriculture, Project Director, SCOR, senior officials&#13;
from relevant government agencies, Director, NRMC, Director, Land Use Policy Planning Division&#13;
(LUPPD), Provincial Director, MAL&amp;F, representatives of NGOs/communities, and the private sector.&#13;
LSC would meet twice a year and prepare progress review reports for the SC.&#13;
37.    Provincial Level. The implementation of the pilot activities would be by the NRMC and PDA in&#13;
close consultation and assistance from LUPPD. There would be a Provincial Steering Committee (PSC)&#13;
chaired by the Chief Secretary and comprising of senior representatives of the MAL&amp;F and MTEWA,&#13;
the Director General Agriculture, and the Directors of the NRMC and Land Use Policy Planning Division&#13;
(LUPPD) of the MAL&amp;F. The committee will meet 4 times/year to review progress and approve the&#13;
2      The Field Extension Team comprising Agricultural Instructors (Al) from the Provincial Department of Agriculture (Provincial&#13;
DOA), Al from the Inter-provincial Schemes, Livestock Development Instructors, Extension Officers from the Department of&#13;
Export Agriculture, and the Coconut Development Officers from the Cultivation Board have been established under the Second&#13;
Agricultural Extension Project (Cr. 2380-CE).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 16 of 18&#13;
microcatchment plans. PSC will be served by the Provincial Implementation Unit (para. 40). The project&#13;
would provide for a Specialist in Natural Resources Management (NRM) and an accountant. The NRM&#13;
specialist would be posted in the Central Provincial Council and would be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
implementation and operation of the component under the supervision of the Chief Secretary Central&#13;
Province Provincial Council. Consultancies would be provided to the PDA to monitor the work relating&#13;
to participatory land use mapping and planning, and community group formation (user groups and&#13;
farmer organization and in participatory plan formulation). An estimated nine personmonth of technical&#13;
assistance would be required. Conditions of Disbursement would be: (a) a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding, satisfactory to IDA, between MTEWA, MAL&amp;F and Provincial Department of&#13;
Agriculture (PDA) of the Central Province shall have been concluded and entered into effect; (b) the LSC&#13;
shall has been established; (c) the Natural Resource Management Specialist and catalysts required for the&#13;
first year's implementation program have been recruited and (d) the standard 30 year lease agreement&#13;
requiring lessees to carry out land management practices satisfactory to the Forestry Department and IDA&#13;
is in effect (para. 6.3). In addition, assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOSL will ensure that&#13;
its Forestry Department extend the term of existing permit holders on reservations for a minimum period&#13;
offive years subject to the lessee carrying out the management practices stipulated (para. 6.1 (m)). The&#13;
memorandum will define the responsibilities, obligations, and linkages in watershed management between&#13;
the MAL&amp;F/DOA, MTEWA, and the Province. It will stipulate that MTEWA would be involved in the&#13;
formulation, overall management at the national level, preparation of the work plan, and review of&#13;
activities. The work plan would be approved by the SC.&#13;
38.     The Provincial Director for Agriculture, the Provincial Director of Animal Production and&#13;
Health, the Divisional Secretary, a representative of a leading NGO, and a representative of the farming&#13;
community, supplemented by technical personnel, would form a team (Provincial Implementation Unit).&#13;
The team would be responsible for identification of priority microcatchments (MCs), coordination of field&#13;
work, and joint interactive planning of selected treatments options. In close consultation with other&#13;
agencies, the Provincial Director of Agriculture &amp; Land Development would be responsible for selection&#13;
of MCs, for coordination of work, and for the determination of the MC plans. The criteria for selection of&#13;
MCs will include: (i) the severity of problems in terms of vegetative degradation and soil erosion; (ii) the&#13;
prospects for achieving an adequate return to the treatments supported by the project; and (iii) the extent&#13;
to which the problems are recognized by the MC population and for which there is willingness to explore&#13;
solutions; and (iv) the relevance of the pilots both in terms of replicability of techniques and treatments&#13;
and the feasibility of participatory community approaches to land management issues over the whole MC.&#13;
The areas selected as MC would be located with the assistance of LUPPD on the GIS maps. The latter&#13;
would form the data base for project implementation and would be continually updated for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
39.    Microcatchment Level. The Provincial Implementation Unit would appoint MC planning teams.&#13;
MCs will be the center piece of the organizational structure. The composition of the MC planning group&#13;
would vary according to the characteristics of the particular MC. It would include a technical officer from&#13;
NRMC, the relevant Field Extension Team members (on a non-full-time basis), the field level forest&#13;
officer, a representative of the Farmer Organization3 (FO), the provincial staff assigned to the project, one&#13;
catalyst/500 ha, and one senior catalyst/10 catalysts on a full-time basis. No staff are expected to be&#13;
permanently located in the MCs. The catalysts would have at least 10 year's relevant experience and&#13;
would work under the direct supervision of the Agricultural Officer of the PDA in charge of the area.&#13;
They would help form and develop user groups, help them make resource-use maps and plans, and guide&#13;
farmers as they implement recommended technical recommendations. The MC planning team in each&#13;
province would be responsible for the initial interaction with the MC village and the resulting indicative&#13;
plan.  This would include the activities that would be undertaken on state lands by the FO, such as&#13;
reforestation on the upper reaches that are denuded and other torrent control, gully plugging,&#13;
checkdarriming on public areas, community participation activities on communal lands, and individual&#13;
3      In almost every village, there is a farner organization registered under the Agrarian Services Act&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 17 of 18&#13;
treatments on farmer lands. The streams and drainage reservations located adjacent to private land are&#13;
expected to be managed by the landowners or the land users. As an incentive, such lands would be leased&#13;
to the users by a suitable arrangement. Fruit and forest trees will be promoted in these lands. The large&#13;
tracts of state land in degraded forest land will be leased to the private sector for planting of perennial&#13;
fruits and forest trees on long-term lease agreement consistent with the program of the Forest Department&#13;
and National Forest Policy.&#13;
40.    Microcatchment planning. Microcatchment planning is the key element to interaction with local&#13;
population. The building blocks of the MC plans are the village plans formulated through close&#13;
interaction over problems and solutions in each of the MC villages. The time required to prepare the&#13;
indicative MC plan would depend on the number of villages in the MC, but an average of one month is&#13;
considered reasonable. After selection of the MC, which includes confirmation of local interest, the first&#13;
step in the planning process entails the marshaling of existing information (data and maps). Sri Lanka is&#13;
fortunate in having a GIS data base that provides a good basis for such planning. Active farmer's&#13;
involvement and community participation regarding the planning and implementation of project actions is&#13;
an essential feature of MC planning. Using a 'farmer centered-problem census, problem solving" (FC-&#13;
PCPS),4 the MC planning process involves the following steps: (i) village discussions of problems and&#13;
constraints and presentation of the menu of treatments provided for under the project, including cost&#13;
sharing arrangements; (ii) village discussions of solutions and priorities (selections from the menu); (iii)&#13;
preparation of draft village plans; (iv) village discussions of draft plans; and (v) finalization of an&#13;
indicative MC plan aggregating the village plans. The FC-PCPS process is expected to ensure that the&#13;
interventions respond to the perceived local needs and priorities and that a genuine commitment to, and&#13;
responsibility for, the success of the project is generated.&#13;
41.    The outcome of this interaction would be agreements on an 'Indicative MC Plan" summarizing&#13;
and aggregating the analysis of available data; the results of the FC-PCPS process; the type, volume, and&#13;
phasing of different treatments selected from the menu; and the extent of cost and benefit sharing for each&#13;
investment. The budget for each microcatchment will obviously vary according to the population and site&#13;
characteristics. Plans would be reviewed by the Provincial Director of Agriculture &amp; Land Development.&#13;
After approval, detailed implementation plans would be agreed upon with the participating community&#13;
members and groups and commitments would be recorded in writing.&#13;
42.    To ensure the provision of high quality planting materials, as well as to diminish transportation&#13;
problems, the project would also support the development of village-based nurseries organized by private&#13;
nurseryman. All efforts would be made to ensure that these nurseries, once established, would constitute&#13;
the major supplier of planting material to the on-farm/off-farm treatments and that the planting material&#13;
would be purchased by the project at competitive market rates based on pre-determined standards.&#13;
43.    Training. The formal training would be organized by the Human Resources Development Center&#13;
(HRDC) of the DOA with the assistance of the NRMC, the PDA, and the Forest Department. The&#13;
necessary resource personnel will be obtained from the relevant organizations. The HRDC would be&#13;
supported by a training specialist who would develop training modules for formal training. Pre-service&#13;
training and in-service training would be provided to the project team members and catalysts at the&#13;
Inservice Training Institute, Gannorouwa. Training of villagers in MC planning and in different treatment&#13;
options would also be provided and study tours arranged to adjacent areas where alternative treatments or&#13;
organizational arrangements have been tried. The farmer training would be done in community centers&#13;
and District Training Centers in the Province.&#13;
44.    Adaptive Research. A flexible approach would be followed for adaptive research covering in situ&#13;
vegetative soil and moisture conservation measures, with new topics added as appropriate. Research&#13;
activities would include: (i) run-off trials to estimate soil losses from arable and non-arable land on&#13;
4      Established under the Second Agricultural Externsion Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 18 of 18&#13;
varying slopes; and (ii) testing, demonstrations, and cost effectiveness of various bioengineering approach&#13;
to soil and water conservation.&#13;
45.     Studies. Provision will be made under the project for a baseline study incorporating a survey that&#13;
would be undertaken by a consultant group. Provision will also be made for a mid-term evaluation and&#13;
for studies that are relevant and useful to the overall goals of the project. This includes, interalia, (i) the&#13;
impact of project interventions on farm incomes and generation of alternatives uses for family labor; (ii)&#13;
the impacts of land-tenure arrangements on productivity and adoption of conservation interventions; (iii)&#13;
the impact of agricultural pricing policy, particularly import controls on incentives to invest in soil&#13;
conservation. Finally, provision will be made for a comprehensive survey and evaluation on project&#13;
completion that will form the basis for analyzing the results of this pilot operation, the cost effectiveness,&#13;
and feasibility of various site-specific techniques and treatments, the success in introducing and&#13;
integrating participatory community approaches in tackling land management problems, and developing a&#13;
package of proven strategies and treatments that could be replicable over a wider area in the hilly regions.&#13;
46.     Role of the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  NGOs would be encouraged to&#13;
participate in the subproject design and implementation. Because several NGOs have considerable&#13;
experience with community development, they could help in at least four ways: (i) by extending informal&#13;
advise to staff from the line agencies upon request; (ii) by conducting training courses for line agency&#13;
staff, under contract, to teach methods of participatory assessment in village preferences; (iii) by designing&#13;
and implementing, under contract, systems for monitoring and evaluation of baseline status and project&#13;
progress; (iv) by implementing, under contract, a MC plan.&#13;
III.    Implementation Schedule&#13;
47.     Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 generated by the Microsoft Project show overall project scheduling and&#13;
detailed schedule of activities for the Institutional Component, the Community Environmental Facility&#13;
Component, and the Land Management Component. The schedules are backed by P.E.R.T. charts (in&#13;
Annex 9) that demonstrate activity linkages.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION 1 PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
1.     This annex presents the details of the rationale used in: (i) the economic and the fiscal analysis of&#13;
the institutional strengthening and the Community Environmental Initiatives Facility (CEIF) components;&#13;
and (ii) the cost-benefit analysis of the pilot land management component. The analysis is mainly&#13;
qualitative as it is not possible to conduct a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis for an environmental&#13;
project with institutional development as its main component. Additionally, most of the benefits are in&#13;
the form of improved health and personal well-being and cannot be quantified precisely. The project&#13;
through strengthening the institutions and improving the policy framework would enable better policy&#13;
formulation and decision making on resource management issues. Through the CEIF, the project would&#13;
provide for several conservation and environment projects at the local level that should assist in&#13;
minimizing environmental degradation. Through measures for land management, on-farm agricultural&#13;
productivity and incomes would increase, and outside the farm areas in the microwatersheds, the activities&#13;
would reduce soil erosion and downstream sedimentation of reservoirs. It is also clear that without the&#13;
project deterioration of the resource base would continue with adverse effects on overall productivity.&#13;
2.     Institutional and Policy Component. The institutional and policy component does not lend itself&#13;
to a quantifiable analysis in terms of applying conventional economic and financial rates of returns&#13;
analysis. However, a brief qualitative description of the rationale for government involvement and&#13;
expected economic costs and benefits is described below.&#13;
The role of the 2overnment&#13;
3.     The rationale for the project is the prevalence of externalities and associated institutional and&#13;
market failures. Over the past decades, there has been a greater reliance on markets and less on the&#13;
government intervention to promote economic development. However, environment is one area in which&#13;
government should maintain a central role. At present, markets do not always accurately reflect the social&#13;
value of the environment. First, markets are not working properly because it is difficult to enforce the&#13;
rights to own or use 'public goods" in the environment. Second, open access to resources, such as water&#13;
bodies, allows them to be exploited, and environmental effects are not recognized by the users. Third, the&#13;
economy lacks information about environmental impacts with private firms having little incentive to&#13;
provide accurate information regarding environmental externalities.&#13;
4.     The role of the government is therefore, inter alia, to formulate environmental policy, increase&#13;
awareness, enforce regulations, and design instruments to capture the environmental externalities. In the&#13;
case of CEA's responsibilities there is, however, scope of contracting out some of its present&#13;
responsibilities, such as the industry licensing and inspection functions. A study and a pilot program&#13;
would be undertaken during the implementation period to analyze the scope for private sector&#13;
participation. The project would also assist in the development of an NGO outreach program.&#13;
5.     The proposed project would help Sri Lanka to meet its environmental challenges through&#13;
important strengthening of the policy formulation process and institutional operational and regulatory&#13;
changes. Environmental degradation is an emerging problem in Sri Lanka where more than 30% of yearly&#13;
GDP is dependent on the country's natural resources, and as rapid industrialization, tourism and&#13;
deforestation take their toll. Integration of environmental objectives would broaden development goals&#13;
leading to a more sustainable development. The policy subcomponent would assist the government to&#13;
review macro- and sector-wide policies with impacts on the environment. It would generally promote the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
adoption of policies that enhance both economic efficiency and sound environmental management (e.g.,&#13;
effluent charges and pollution taxes). The institutional component would strengthen the focal entity for&#13;
environmental policy, planning and coordination (MTEWA), and the institution responsible for regulatory&#13;
and enforcement activities (CEA). As noted above, the public institutions will only be strengthened in&#13;
those areas that cannot be performed by the private sector.&#13;
Impact on recurrent cost.&#13;
6.      Some expenditures introduced by the proposed project will become part of the government's&#13;
ongoing recurrent cost after project completion. Such recurrent expenditures are: (i) salaries for staff who&#13;
will be hired to perform new task or to reinforce already existing teams: and (ii) operating tasks associated&#13;
with these programs. To assess the sustainability of the proposed project, the project's recurrent cost&#13;
implications for both the Environment Division of the MTEWA and the CEA is estimated below.&#13;
7.     In 1995, the Environment Division and CEA's total expenditures are estimated to be 0.01% and&#13;
0.02%, respectively, of total government expenditures.  While these expenditures are insignificant&#13;
compared with the overall budgetary expenditures, the budgetary impact on the institutions is large.&#13;
Current expenditures are projected to rise by 39% and 33% from 1996 to the end of the four-year project&#13;
implementation period in the Environment Division and the CEA, respectively, in constant 1995 prices&#13;
(see Attachment 1). The rise in recurrent costs is driven by the expansion in staff. Not only would staff&#13;
costs increase by some 37% and 38% for the ED and CEA, respectively, but many other costs would also&#13;
increase as the additional staff undertake more activities.' However, this incremental recurrent of Rs. 18&#13;
million, in constant 1995 prices, by the end of the project implementation period is equivalent to only&#13;
0.2% of MTEWA's budgeted expenditures in 1995 (of Rs.7,157 million).&#13;
8.      The project would finance 90% of incremental recurrent cost, except incremental salaries which&#13;
would be funded according to a declining basis starting at 90% in the first year of the project, 70% in the&#13;
second year and 50% until the end of the project period. The figures below show the total incremental&#13;
recurrent cost and the share financed by IDA, respectively. Overall, the fiscal responsibility lies with the&#13;
government, and in cases where the government does not recoup all project costs, these unrecouped&#13;
investments should be viewed as benefits to society as a whole arising from externality gains.&#13;
Measures to Improve Fiscal Sustainability&#13;
9.     In principle, the government has agreed to finance an increasing share of the additional recurrent&#13;
cost associated with the project during the project implementation period. This commitment ensures the&#13;
willingness and capacity of the government to sustain CEA and the ED's expenditures and activities in&#13;
future years, once the project is completed. However, the stringent budgetary conditions suggest that&#13;
additional measures should be taken to ensure fiscal sustainability. Furthermore, while the expenditure&#13;
increase is not large in absolute terms, representatives from the Ministry of Finance may be concerned&#13;
that other public institutions could demand similar budget expansions.&#13;
In this context, it should be noted that the recurrent cost implications of other development projects implemented by the Ministry and&#13;
CEA has not been estimated in detail but appear to be small.&#13;

10.     Options for the enhancement of the fiscal sustainability of the project include the following&#13;
measures. First, overall fiscal adjustment would facilitate for the government to engage in high priority&#13;
areas, such as the environment, where it has its comparative advantage. Second, a freeze on new hiring in&#13;
the non-staff grades including positions currently unfilled would improve sustainability. An expansion in&#13;
the numbers of support staff does not seem required because current ratios of support to higher level staff&#13;
are high, especially in the ED (ratio of 4.5) but also in the CEA (ratio of 1.6), and the availability of office&#13;
equipment would be enhanced as a result of the proposed project. Finally, fiscal sustainability would be&#13;
enhanced by an increase in fees with the objective of financing (at least partially) CEA's incremental cost&#13;
of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
Promosed Cost-recovery Mechanism.&#13;
11.    In 1994, CEA's revenues from fees amounted to about Rs 3.6 million in 1995 constant prices,&#13;
compared to an average of recurrent incremental costs of Rs 17.4 million per year during the project&#13;
implementation period. The proposed project is expected to contribute to a higher stream of revenues.&#13;
First, without the strengthening of the CEA, the current backlog of license application would continue to&#13;
rapidly increase. The proposed new structure of the CEA (including additional resources and training of&#13;
the current staff in licensing procedures) is designed to keep up with the expected number of license&#13;
applications, while clearing the current backlog. Second, there is scope for increasing the fees. Finally,&#13;
in the medium to longer term, the work undertaken in the context of the policy subcomponent may&#13;
enhance revenues as a result of introduction of environmental-related taxes and charges.&#13;
12.    Preliminary calculations show that with only a moderate increase in the fee structure, the&#13;
revenues attributed to the fees would more than offset CEA's increased current cost attributed to the&#13;
project. Two scenarios have been constructed, both assuming modest increases in CEA's staff. In a low-&#13;
case scenario, assuming a somewhat higher fee structure than the present one, revenues attributed to fees&#13;
could increase from Rs 3.6 million in 1994, to Rs 18 million by the end of the project period, both in 1995&#13;
constant prices. In a high-case scenario, with average license fee for large industrial premises of&#13;
approximately Rs. 100,000 per year (compared with Rs.500,000 to Rs. 10,000,000 per year in developed&#13;
countries), CEA's revenues from fees could increase to about Rs 58 million by the end of the project&#13;
period, in constant 1995 prices (see Table A7,1 and Attachment 1). Detailed analyses on the scope of&#13;
increased fees will be undertaken in the context of the proposed fee license study (para.5.8).&#13;

Economic Analysis of the Pilot Land Manazement ComPonent&#13;
13.    Pilot Land Management Component.  Cost-benefit analysis was carried out only for the land&#13;
management component. The purpose of the land management component is to: (i) test and develop, on a&#13;
watershed basis, suitable technologies for minimizing the extent of land degradation, thereby increasing&#13;
agricultural productivity and reducing associated on-farm and off-farm impacts; (ii) examine the&#13;
feasibility of participatory management of the microwatersheds by the beneficiaries; and (iii) define&#13;
technical criteria for replicating watershed development activities in the hilly areas. The primary benefits&#13;
of the land management component include improved productivity and income through overall&#13;
improvement of soil. Land management activities carried out on ten selected microwatersheds consists of&#13;
on-farm and off-farm activities, and accounts for only 15% of total project costs. This analysis applies&#13;
only to the on-farm activities, which is about 10% of the total project costs, and directly estimates on-farm&#13;
benefits through increased productivity. The project benefits accruing to approximately 12,500 farm&#13;
families and covering about one half of the total pilot area which is about 10,000 ha are expected to be&#13;
significant. Most project benefits would emanate from the introduction of low-cost land management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
practices such as vegetative contour barriers, stone terraces and other soil stabilization, and moisture&#13;
retention practices. The most direct beneficiaries would be the rural poor, marginal, and small farmers.&#13;
They would benefit from the additional output generated by the project at the farm level. Improved&#13;
management of watersheds is, moreover, expected to have important off-farm benefits in the form of&#13;
decreased sedimentation as well as a decrease in the risks associated with flooding and land slides. For&#13;
example, the physical soil loss of the Upper Mahaweli catchment is estimated at 132,000 tons/year and the&#13;
siltation level of the Polgolla reservoir in 1994 (only 14 years after commissioning) was estimated at 44%&#13;
of capacity.2 The analysis does not include externality benefits of on-farm activities nor the benefits and&#13;
costs of off-farm activities within the microwatershed, and to that extent the analysis is an&#13;
underestimation of rate of return.&#13;
14.    Assumptions. The underlying assumptions were employed in the analysis: (i) Prices. All values&#13;
have been expressed in constant 1995 prices. All traded commodities were valued at import parity prices&#13;
and all non-traded goods are based on domestic financial prices. Appropriate adjustments were made for&#13;
margins, freight, handling, processing, and quality differentials. Non-traded outputs and inputs were&#13;
expressed in border rupees through application of standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9. The wage rate&#13;
for unskilled labor was assumed to be equal to the financial wage rate; (ii) Yields. Due to soil depletion,&#13;
it is assumed that yields would decline by 1% per annum3 in the 'without" project case. Yields are&#13;
assumed to decline by 10% in the year that the treatments are undertaken but are assumed to increase by&#13;
2% per annum thereafter; (iii) Project Life. A project life of twenty years was assumed for the analysis;&#13;
and (iv) Investment Costs. After removing price contingencies, taxes, and duties, all investment costs&#13;
have been included in the analysis.&#13;
15.    Benefits to Farmers. A detailed analysis of farm benefits was carried out for the pilot area.&#13;
Benefits to farmers are expected to accrue as a result of increase in yields of existing crops due to&#13;
improved land management practices that result in improved retention of soil nutrients. To assess the&#13;
component's on-farm benefits, two representative farm models were developed taking into account the&#13;
major agroecological zones and cropping pattern. Both models use survey data to derive current farming&#13;
practices, costs, and revenue. The 'With" project case includes land treatments such as vegetative contour&#13;
hedges, lock and spill dams and stone terraces, and related costs and benefits that are compared with the&#13;
'Without" project situation. These treatments are currently being evaluated on an individual treatment&#13;
basis by other donor-assisted projects, and the benefits are based on preliminary results. As the average&#13;
farm size in the project area is less than one acre, these farm models are based on 1.0 acre mixed farm.&#13;
Existing farming practices, crop mix, costs, and returns were based on survey information provided by&#13;
MAL&amp;F and confirmed by field observations and consultations with farmers.&#13;
16.    The analysis of farm returns shows  a substantial increase in income as a result of new&#13;
technologies. By year 5, the incremental farm income for both farm models would increase on average by&#13;
about Rs.5,548 (which is about 12% more than the 'Without" project case), and in year 10, the&#13;
incremental income would be Rs.24,672 (which is about 63% more than the 'Without" project case). The&#13;
average incomes of farmers adopting Model 1 would increase by 53% and double (104%) in farm Model&#13;
2. The increase in farm incomes reflects the high potential productivity of the proposed land management&#13;
practices. The results of farm budget analysis (aggregate benefits over a period of 20 years) are given in&#13;
Tables A7.3 -A7.5.&#13;
17.    Economic Rate of Return. The financial costs and benefits and the Economic Rate of Return&#13;
(ERR) are estimated using farm survey data. The net benefits are the overall increase in output as a result&#13;
of the land management practices introduced that result in improved soil fertility. This is compared with&#13;
the 'Without" project case of a decline in yields of 1% per year. Based on the farm income analysis,&#13;

farmers would find a quick yielding return on the investments. Based on the assumptions, the overall&#13;
economic rate of return of the proposed interventions to farmers in the pilot micro-watersheds is 16% in&#13;
Model 1 and 28% in Model 2. The average weighted rate of return is 24%.&#13;
18.    Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity analysis shows that the ERRs are robust and not sensitive to&#13;
delays in project benefits or increases in project costs. Even a 30% increase in costs would result in a&#13;
decline in the ERR's to 13% and 25% in Models 1 and 2, respectively. A lag in benefits by three years&#13;
combined with a 20% increase in costs would reduce the ERRs to 10% and 19%, respectively. Tables&#13;
A7.3 and A7.4 show a range of cost increase and lags in benefits and its effect on the ERRs.  The&#13;
sensitivity analysis also shows that it is not sensitive to shortfalls in projected yields, hence decline in&#13;
projected benefits. A decline in benefits by 40% would reduce the ERRs to 11% for Model 1 and 22% for&#13;
Model 2. To test the sensitivity of the component's ERRs to possible adverse outcomes, an analysis of&#13;
switching values of costs and benefits was carried out. The results indicate that if benefits decline by 30%&#13;
and 75% for Models 1 and 2, respectively, the ERR declines to 12% which is the opportunity cost of&#13;
capital. Costs would have to increase by 50% and 290% for Models 1 and 2, respectively for the ERR to&#13;
decline to 12%.&#13;

Preliminary revenue scenarios.&#13;
Below are two revenue scenarios presented. Both scenarios assumes a modest increase in CEA's staffing&#13;
(in line with the proposed set-up for the first year of project implementation). In the low revenue scenario&#13;
the fees are increased only somewhat. In the high revenue scenario the average license fee for large&#13;
industrial premises in Sri Lanka is assumed to be raised to approximately US$ 2,000 per year, which is to&#13;
compare with license fees for large industries in developed countries between US$ 10,000 and over US$&#13;
200,000 per year.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the
            Environmental Action 1 Project is to help the Sri Lankan
            government strengthen its institutional and policy framework
            for environmental management within which the International
            Development Association and other donors will provide
            assistance.  In particular, the project will: support
            restructuring the Environmental Division (ED) in the
            Ministry of Transport, Environment and Women's Affairs
            (MTEWA) for better policy planning and coordination; and
            strengthen the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to
            better carry out its analytical, monitoring, and enforcement
            responsibilities; support ongoing efforts to integrate
            environmental considerations in the overall development
            planning process; and help the government take immediate
            remedial measures to reverse the trend of environmental
            degradation through pilot programs involving participatory
            approaches to environmental management.  The project will
            comprise three major components:  (1) Institutional
            Strengthening -restructuring ED within MTEWA to allow it to
            play a central role in environmental policy, planning and
            coordination nationally; restructuring and strengthening CEA
            by establishing and implementing a staff development
            program; enhancing the Industrial Licensing and Inspection
            Program; developing environmental codes of practice for
            small industries; improving   EIA capacity, and
            strengthening the environmental information system;
            providing office and technical facilities to accommodate
            both ED and CEA; and studying linkages between sector and
            economy-wide policies and the environment including an
            annual review of the environmental implications of the
            Public Investment Program (PIP), and further updating the
            National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).  (2) Community
            Environmental Initiatives Facility (CEIF) -which will be
            established to finance well-planned environmental activities
            at the grass-roots level within the priority NEAP/PIP.  CEIF
            will provide a mechanism for pooling resources -to which
            other donors could also contribute- and serve as a vehicle
            for private sector and NGO participation and for
            decentralizing environmental activities.  (3) Pilot Land
            Management Component -which will entail pilot projects
            involving community participation in rehabilitating degraded lands.
