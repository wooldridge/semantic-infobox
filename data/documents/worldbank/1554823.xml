ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper uses national samples and village studies to examine the&#13;
demographic characteristics of households at high risk of poverty or&#13;
ultra-poverty. Before industrialization in now-developed countries, such&#13;
households were likely to be smaller than others; normally, the opposite is&#13;
true in low-income countries now.  Yet status (job, asset-holding, etc.)&#13;
continues to be positively linked to household size. In Section II, these&#13;
facts are traced to differences, over space and time, in marriage-age,&#13;
fertility, family/household ratio, and family complexity, and to a lesser&#13;
extent to differential mortality, migration, and life-cycle effects. Section&#13;
III turns from household size to household structure; poverty risk in today's&#13;
LICs usually shows strong positive links with high child/adult ratios, weak&#13;
negative links with age of household head, and very weak links with&#13;
sex-composition. Scale-economies to household consumption are little&#13;
researched, but may also affect poverty risk.&#13;
Many relationships in Secs. II and III weaken, or vanish, among the&#13;
very poorest. Moreover, inferences to time-series (e.g. about what&#13;
urbanization does to household size) are more than usually complicated.&#13;
However, the relationships support strong implications for poverty measurement&#13;
(Sec. IV), though much more tentative suggestions for policy. Outlay per&#13;
household is an almost useless poverty measure; outlay per person is almost as&#13;
good as outlay per consumer unit for broad allocative purposes, though not for&#13;
"diagnosing" the poverty problems of particular households. Demographic&#13;
assay, to assess how major policies affect big households with many children,&#13;
could improve the poverty impact of many types of government action.&#13;

CHARACTERISTICS OF POOR AND POOREST: GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO WORKING PAPERS&#13;
(a) Origins&#13;
In 1982, a Bank-wide Task Force reported on the impact of Bank&#13;
activities on poor people. It showed that the proportion of the Bank's&#13;
lending directed mainly at people in absolute or relative poverty had risen&#13;
sharply - from about 5% in 1968 to 30% in 1980. Moreover, such activities&#13;
showed rates of return at least as good as conventional lending, and&#13;
succeeded, as intended, in benefiting mainly the poor. However, "neither&#13;
borrowers nor lenders have been very effective in benefiting people who lack&#13;
productive assets - the poorest 20%" (World Bank, 1983, pp. ii, 3, 5, 6-7).&#13;
The report stressed the need for increasing the salience of poverty reduction&#13;
in Bank "policy dialogue" with developing countries. But what can they learn&#13;
from each other about appropriate policies for the poorest 20%?&#13;
While working with Alexander Shakow and Norman Hicks on the&#13;
secretariat of the Task Force, the author of the present paper was examining&#13;
the characteristics of the poor and the poorest. This search was given&#13;
special urgency by the Bank's partial success in raising the productivity of&#13;
the poor, and its relative failure to do the same for the poorest. It may be,&#13;
of course, that the "power structure" somehow prevents the poorest quintile of&#13;
households in low-income countries - or the poorest decile in middle-income&#13;
countries - from sharing the fruits of growth, while allowing moderately poor&#13;
people to do so. Before accepting such a complicated hypothesis, however, we&#13;
should look at the alternative: that very poor people (unlike the moderately&#13;
poor) have characteristics that affect their capacity to benefit from&#13;
development programs.&#13;
This is one of four linked Working Papers that aim to identify such&#13;
characteristics, if any. Three in the series - dealing with nutrition, labor&#13;
and demography - will appear early in 1983, and the fourth, on assets, later&#13;
that year.&#13;
(b) Data sources&#13;
It had been hoped to draw mainly on data sets for two ecologically&#13;
oomparable poor regions, one Asian and one African, each with&#13;
micro-information from good village studies supported by regional data from&#13;
larger sample surveys. Partly to follow data availability, partly to ensure&#13;
that climatic fluotuations would permit study of variability as a poverty&#13;
problem, we selected semi-arid areas in N.W. India and N. Nigeria. In N.W.&#13;
India, main emphasis was to be placed on Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra;&#13;
the first two States permit the use of village studies by the Agro-economic&#13;
Research Centre at Vallabh Vidyanagar (e.g Brahmbhatt, 1977; R.Patel, 1964,&#13;
1964a; V. Patel, 1973), and the last two of Pravin Visaria's disaggregations&#13;
of National Sample Survey data by household outlay-per-person deciles&#13;
(Visaria, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1980a). In N. Nigeria, outstanding work at the&#13;
Ahmadu Bello University (Department of Agricultural Economics) has produced&#13;
three good surveys, each covering three villages (Simmons, 1976; Norman, 1976;&#13;
Matlon, oited in Norman et al., 1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
As work progressed, however, it proved essential to support&#13;
hypotheses from these sources with other enquiries, urban and rural, from a&#13;
wide range of LDCs.&#13;
(o) Disoontinuities&#13;
Not because this was originally expected or planned, but because of&#13;
the accumulating evidence, the method of these Working Papers came&#13;
inoreasingly to involve a search, not simply for relationships between poverty&#13;
and other characteristics (e.g. participation rates, caloric inadequaoy or&#13;
family size), but for discontinuities in these relationships. It transpired&#13;
that in LICs such discontinuities usually oocured, not at the "poverty line"&#13;
(i.e., not between the "poor" and the rest), but at a much lower level of&#13;
income or outlay, per person or per consumer unit: the level of ultra-poverty.&#13;
This is consistent with discontinuities observed in experimental work&#13;
on producers' behavior. Notably, farmers exhibit "threshold" changes in&#13;
behavior (in respect of risk-aversion, reluctance to innovate, and - given the&#13;
technology - reversal of the usual inverse relationship between size of&#13;
operated farm and yield-per-acre) not around the poverty-line, but around the&#13;
muob lower level of welfare at which subsistence appears to be endangered.&#13;
The disoontinuities do not normally take the form of sudden, sharp&#13;
rises or falls - as income or outlay, per person or per consumer unit,&#13;
increases - in the proportion of persons within a given income or outlay&#13;
interval. Rather there are reversals or intensifioations - i.e.,&#13;
respectively, turning-points or points of inflexion - in behavior, as welfare&#13;
changes around levels of great poverty. It is well known that per-person&#13;
inoome and outlay are usually distributed more or less lognormally. However,&#13;
as these crude "welfare" indicators fall, adult female workforce participation&#13;
rates increase until a "welfare" level signifiying extreme poverty is reaohed&#13;
- and then decrease with further falls in welfare. Ratios of food spending to&#13;
total outlay, around much the same point on the "welfare" scale, shift from&#13;
steady rises as poverty increases, to a more or less constant 80-85% level.&#13;
Unemployment rates, a steadily increasing function of poverty, increase more&#13;
sharply at very low income.levels, and become more seasonally unstable.&#13;
(d) Causality&#13;
On suoh issues, and generally, these Working Papers try to remain&#13;
agnostio about causality. For example, we find that income-per-person (and&#13;
other welfare indicators) tend to increase fairly steadily as household size&#13;
falls, yet paradoxioally also tend to be higher among groups of households&#13;
with higher wealth or status. In seeking to reconcile these two findings we&#13;
try not to make our explanations dependent upon whether large family size is&#13;
cause or effect of (i) higher status or asset ownership, and/or (ii) smaller&#13;
welfare at a given status or wealth level. Perhaps larger households get&#13;
poorer, as Malthus posited; perhaps poorer households deoide, or are driven,&#13;
to get larger, as is averred by economio demographers of both Marxist and&#13;
neo-classical persuasions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
The soarce and soattered data, the extreme rarity of time-series, and&#13;
our ignoranoe of how very poor people reaoh deoisions all suggest that one&#13;
should defer attempts to make strong eausal statements. These papers "explore&#13;
the space" relating poverty to, say, eoonomic and demographic charaeteristics.&#13;
We must discover the direction and strength of the relationships, the gaps in&#13;
observations on variables, and the turning-points or points of inflexion.&#13;
Only then can we make sensible claims about causal directions. The author is&#13;
too interested in policy inferences (and too incautious) to abjure all causal&#13;
hypothesizing. However, the preferred form of oonclusion should uaually, at&#13;
this stage, be neutral between "A causes B"p "B causes A", and "C oauses A and&#13;
B". These papers are a first shot at outlining the shape, under different&#13;
circumstances, of functional relations between poverty-variables (A) and&#13;
characteristics-variables (B). Causal speoification is largely left for&#13;
others.&#13;
(e) Policy for a non-underclass&#13;
What, if any, policy conclusions can be drawn from causally&#13;
inexplicit relationships? The answer depends on the nature, alterability, and&#13;
costs of remedying the characteristics associated with moderate and extreme&#13;
poverty. In particular, is remedying those characteristics likely to enable&#13;
an affected person significantly to raise his or her outlay or income in a&#13;
self-sustained way? Or is such improvement, instead, the likeliest way to&#13;
remedy them? The answer to that question is logically independent of whether&#13;
the characteristics "caused" the poverty level in the first place, or were&#13;
caused by it.&#13;
Hence we may be able to identify important policy implications of the&#13;
"characteristios-poverty-ultrapoverty" links - implioations independent of&#13;
the causality of these links. One such implication is central to our whole&#13;
enquiry. We find that the ultrs-poor have very different behavioral&#13;
characteristics from other poor (and nonpoor) people. Do these&#13;
characteristics mean that most of the ultra-poor belong to an "underclass"?&#13;
It has been argued that the poorest 5-15 percent of people in&#13;
developed countries have "underclass" characteristics rendering it impossible,&#13;
or prohibitively costly, to enable them to raise their income and productivity&#13;
in a self-sustained way. These characteristios may be linked to misfortune&#13;
(e.g. persistent mental deficiency in persons recently released from&#13;
hospitals), to earlier choice (e.g. alcoholism), or even to demographic&#13;
circumstance (e.g. widowed and childless status). Whatever the moral issues,&#13;
and whether the characteristics cause poverty or are caused by it, the result&#13;
is the same: the "underclass" cannot at reasonable cost be helped to help&#13;
itself out of poverty, but must rely on social-security payments or on&#13;
charity.&#13;
The evidence of these Working Papers strongly indicates that the&#13;
great majority of the ultra-poor in LDCs are not, in this sense, an&#13;
unreachable "underclass". Their extreme poverty is associated with lack of&#13;
promising human and physioal assets; with weak labor-market positions; with&#13;
large familiea, high dependenoy ratios, and very high infant mortality; and&#13;
with significant risks of nutritional damage. Only tiny proportions of the&#13;
Third World's ultra-poor oould survive as drug addits, aleoholiosp mental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
defectives, or even single-member families. These ultra-poor are mostly a&#13;
resource, not a burdensome underclass.&#13;
This raises a second policy issue, also largely independent of the&#13;
causal links between characteristics and ultra-poverty. Does an ultra-poor&#13;
group require different projects and policies, to achieve self-sustained&#13;
improvements in income and productivity, from those required by the moderately&#13;
poor? These working papers suggest that "food and health first", especially&#13;
for children - and policies to improve capacity to contest labor and asset&#13;
markets - may be necessary preconditions for improved productivity for the&#13;
ultra-poor. Otherwise, benefits from "poor people's projects" will continue&#13;
to stop at the second quintile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

DEMOGRAPHY AND POVERTY&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Within a country, what demographic characteristics tend to be&#13;
found in households 1/ with a high risk of poverty or ultra-poverty? 2/&#13;
To ask this question in a policy context is really to ask four related&#13;
questions. This paper tackles them separately, to simplify the&#13;
exposition. However, it may be helpful to say a little about them (and&#13;
their interconnection) at the beginning. The four questions concern:&#13;
relationships between incidence of poverty and (1) household sizet (2)&#13;
household structure; (3) appropriate denominator in measuring adequacy&#13;
of household "resources"; 3/ and (4) implications for policies against&#13;
poverty.&#13;
The first question, treated in Section II, is: what&#13;
relationships exist between the size of a household (number of persons)&#13;
and the likelihood that it will be poor or ultra-poor? "Household size"&#13;
comprises the family's adults (who usually work and earn); its children&#13;
(who usually consume but do not earn); and non-family servants and&#13;
lodgers (both usually absent in poor households). Household size is&#13;
also affected by distinct, but interrelated, demographic events - birth,&#13;
household splitting through migration, household formation through&#13;
marriage, death; such effects can be influenced by poverty (as when&#13;
undernutrition increases infant mortality), or can themselves influence&#13;
poverty (as when dependency burdens increase). Moreover, households may&#13;
be unusually large because they are complex, i.e. not nuclear; 4/&#13;
because they are at a certain stage in the family cycle; or because they&#13;
have experienced unusual patterns of demographic events. Each of these&#13;
three "size-increasing" variables, for given values of the other two,&#13;
has distinct relationships to the incidence of household poverty:&#13;
negative in the case of complexity, positive but short-lived for&#13;
"swollen" phases of the family cycle, positive and long-lasting if a&#13;
given family has acquired unusually many children who have survived&#13;
into, say, the age-group 3-8. In view of these intricacies, it is&#13;
fortunate that a quite clear answer emerges to the first question (pp.&#13;
7-13).&#13;
Section III turns to the question: given the number of&#13;
persons in a household, how is the household's risk of poverty connected&#13;
to its demographic structure by age and sex - including the age and sex&#13;
of head of household, the ratio of dependents to persons of "working&#13;
age", and the probable position of that structure in the family cycle?&#13;
The demographic structure of poor households is linked to their size in&#13;
three ways: static, dynamic and definitional. The static links appear,&#13;
for example, in cross-sections that, in total populations of an area,&#13;
show that smaller households are likelier to be female-headed, yet that&#13;
female-headedness and largeness are each independently linked,&#13;
positively and significantly, to the incidence of poverty. The dynamic&#13;
links concern the different potential, of households with different age-&#13;
and sex-structures, to alter future size and capacity to earn. The&#13;
definitional links arise from the widespread wish to measure household&#13;
size, not by number of persons, but in some sense by number of units of&#13;
",anfii namant_&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Section IV asks: should the poverty or ultra-poverty of a&#13;
household, and thence the incidence of poverty in a group (e.g. female-&#13;
headed households), be measured by reference to the inadequacy of&#13;
"resources" per household, per person, or per unit of requirement? If&#13;
all persons had the same needs, if household size were statistically&#13;
independent of both resources and resources-per-person, and if there&#13;
were neither economies nor diseconomies of scale in consumption, then&#13;
per-household measures would suffice. Since bigger households clearly&#13;
tend to have more earners and thus higher total "resources", however,&#13;
low resources-per-household indicate an indeterminate mixture of&#13;
household poverty and household smallness. This is only very slightly -&#13;
and again indeterminately - offset by the tendency of smaller households&#13;
to have higher needs-per-person (adult/child ratios); by the positive&#13;
correlation between poverty and household size; 5/ and by (modest)&#13;
economies of scale in consumption. Hence, as shown empirically in&#13;
earlier Bank work (such as Datta and Meerman, 1980), income or outlay&#13;
per household, while widely used to "measure poverty", is demonstrably,&#13;
and usually completely, worthless for this purpose, because it&#13;
misclassifies many large poor households as non-poor, and many small&#13;
non-poor households as poor. Per-person measures are much better;&#13;
somewhat better still, though costly and controversial, are indicators&#13;
of resources per consumer unit, whether measured crudely by means of&#13;
adult-equivalents or subtly by means of equivalence scales (Deaton and&#13;
Muellbauer, 1983).&#13;
Finally, Section V asks: what does the present state of&#13;
knowledge about the links between poverty, household size, and household&#13;
demographic structure - and the implications of that knowledge for&#13;
identifying the incidence of poor households and hence persons - mean&#13;
for policy? We shall seek only limited and modest answers, mainly&#13;
because the links are not causally clear. For examplet if we do not&#13;
know whether some households have a high incidence of poverty because&#13;
they are big, or whether they are big because they are poor, then it is&#13;
not clear which issue - say, assets for the poor, or incentives to keep&#13;
families small - is best tackled first. 6/ However, a good deal can be&#13;
said on the policy issues, without specifying the directions of&#13;
causation, simply by virtue of being able to identify what sorts of&#13;
"household demographies" are likely to be associated empirically with a&#13;
high risk of poverty. Not only can we more easily identify the types of&#13;
place or time in which a given project is likely to affect poor&#13;
households, if we can find where or when households have demographic&#13;
features linked with poverty. At least as important is the prospect of&#13;
diagnosing the sorts of productive activity through which households, in&#13;
various comon poverty-linked demographic circumstances, can escape from&#13;
poverty. For example, consider the oase of expanded asset-ownership&#13;
associated with extra rural informal-sector non-farm income. The type&#13;
of assets and activities readily open to female-headed households with&#13;
small children, to big male-headed households, and to old and single&#13;
persons will be quite distinct.&#13;

II. POVERTY AND HOUSEHOLD SIZE&#13;
(a) Historically, poor households tended to be small&#13;
This section will argue that poverty is nowadays strongly&#13;
linked to big household size. Two prior objections are (1) that too few&#13;
people live in big households to account for much of a phenomenon as&#13;
pervasive as LDC poverty, and (2) that historically poor households were&#13;
smaller than better-off ones. How are such objeotions to be met?&#13;
It used to be widely believed that, in now-developed countries&#13;
(NDCs) before industrialization and in most developing societies still,&#13;
households tended to be large, often complex. However, the Cambridge&#13;
Group for History of Population and Social Structure (see especially&#13;
Laslett and Wall (eds.), 1972) has shown that the nuclear household of 2&#13;
to 6 persons has, in most cultures at most times, predominated (except&#13;
in some of the serf-based societies of Eastern Europe, where the&#13;
seigneur applied pressures for peasant complexity: Czap, 1983, esp. p.&#13;
145).  Between 1574 and 1821, in 100 English communities with relatively&#13;
good data, mean household size (MHS), excluding institutions, averaged&#13;
4.8, and 73% of households were of size 2-6 (Laslett, 1972, pp. 133,&#13;
146). Similar data are reported from the pre-industrial history of&#13;
almost all Western countries; even in exceptional cases such as Serbia,&#13;
large complex households remain a minority (Laslett and Wall (eds.),&#13;
1972, passim; Wall et al. (eds.), 1983, passim). Comparable results are&#13;
found in recent developing-country censuses, showing in the mid-1960s&#13;
"no bona fide case of a national average household size larger than six"&#13;
(Burch, 1972, p. 91). Historical sociology in developing countries, as&#13;
with Shah's careful analysis of Gujarati census data from 1821 to 1951,&#13;
suggests if anything even smaller households - and with even less&#13;
tendency to dwindle over time - than prevailed in the West (A. Shah,&#13;
1968).&#13;
Low mean household size (MHS) cuts the scope for downward&#13;
variation - in either rich or poor households - and a fortiori for&#13;
linkage between such variation and wealth or poverty. Moreover, though&#13;
most NDC series show very gentle downtrends in MHS over several&#13;
centuries, there is no tendency, as households or communities&#13;
differentiate themselves upward in early industrialization, for MHS or&#13;
complexity to fall sharply. If anything, there is a slight increase -&#13;
around 1750 in England 7/ (Wachter and Laslett, 1978, p. 76; Wall, 1972,&#13;
pp. 191-2), and in 1920-65 in Japan (Nakane, 1972, p. 531).&#13;
As if to make more surprising the proposition that big&#13;
households now tend to be poor, historical evidence suggests that such&#13;
modest upward variation in household size as did exist in NDCs&#13;
accompanied greater affluence, permitting a net inflow of servants,&#13;
early marriage with many children, and/or complex family structures,&#13;
within a relatively large family house. In sharp contrast to recent&#13;
evidence from poor countries, child/adult ratios in Tuscany in 1427&#13;
appear to have risen sharply with household wealth (Klapisch, p. 274) -&#13;
pulling up MHS with them, at least among the 10,000-odd Florentine&#13;
families listed (ibid., p. 277). In 23 Polish villages in 1789, peasant&#13;
affluence clearly meant higher child/adult ratios and hence bigger&#13;
households (Kochanowicz, 1983, pp. 158-9). In Hirase, Japan, around&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1818, again "the wealthier households...were...larger than average for&#13;
this area" (Nakane, p. 528). In a hundred English communities from 1574&#13;
to 1821, laborers and paupers respectively showed MHSs of 4.5 and 4.0,&#13;
as against the 4.8 averaged by all households (Laslett, 1972, pp.&#13;
133,154). Hajnal summarizes the conclusion of pre-industrial&#13;
demography:  "It is often said ... that the rich can maintain larger&#13;
households than the poor. There is some truth in this proposition"&#13;
(Hajnal, 1982, p. 454).&#13;
We need to explain the possibility, and then to demonstrate&#13;
the fact, that - despite generally small and nuclear households; and&#13;
despite historical evidence that poorer families used to be smaller than&#13;
others - there is today sufficient variation in household size, and in a&#13;
direction sufficiently different from that of historical data, for LDC&#13;
poverty to crowd heavily into big households. The fact does seem clear-&#13;
cut in almost all LDCs, despite occasional counter-examples (e.g. Hull&#13;
and Hull, 1976). However, in reconciling the new fact to the old&#13;
evidence, we shall bear in mind a curious paradox, which, because it so&#13;
sharply illuminates the demography of poverty, will be at the center of&#13;
this paper. It is the paradox that in today's LDCs, although in total&#13;
populations (in defiance of historical NDC experience) big families tend&#13;
to be poor families, groups of households with relatively low status -&#13;
the assetless, the female-headed, the landless, the remote, the low-&#13;
caste - tend to be relatively small, just as the historical evidence&#13;
suggests. 8/&#13;
(b) Current and recent evidence: big households tend to be poor&#13;
Almost every recent study, at whatever level of&#13;
disaggregation, for either a particular group or a total population,&#13;
shows the incidence of poverty and MHS increasing together. Table 1,&#13;
calculated from Visaria's presentation of decile-wise relationships for&#13;
several rural and urban South Asian populations, shows very high rank&#13;
correlations. For all-India data, three pooled cross-sections of 4118&#13;
rural households - for 1968-9, 1970-1 and 1971-2 - confirm that "the&#13;
probability of a (household's] being poor increases with its size", both&#13;
for total populations and for cultivating households and day-wage&#13;
households sampled separately (Gaiha, 1982, pp. 24, 32).&#13;
Table 2 gives more detail - from large urban and rural samples&#13;
for 1973-4 - for three States in Western India; once again, MHS is&#13;
significantly larger for the poorest (MEP below Rs. 34 per month) than&#13;
for the poor (Rs. 34-43), and much larger for both than for less-poor&#13;
groups. Table 2 also shows that higher child/adult ratios are&#13;
responsible for much of the larger MHS among the poor, again in sharp&#13;
contrast to historical data, but as we see in Section III confirmed by&#13;
evidence from elsewhere. However, Table 2 confirms - indeed sharpens -&#13;
the historical hints (p. 7) that urbanization does not help the poor to&#13;
escape poverty by reducing family size; poor and ultra-poor households&#13;
are substantially larger in Western Indian towns than in Western Indian&#13;
villages, though the opposite is true of better-off households.&#13;
Does this strong size-poverty link - established for several&#13;
Asian countries, in some detail for India, and for particular States&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
within India - persist within the small comunity, or is it a so-called&#13;
"ecological fallacy" (Dasgupta, 1977, pp. 90-92), in which better-off&#13;
places show lower average household size than do poorer places, although&#13;
within a typical comunity poorer households might be no bigger than the&#13;
average for that place? This may be so. Seventeen of the village&#13;
surveys, carried out by an outstanding Indian center for suoh studies&#13;
between 1961 and 1975, in Gujarat and Rajasthan show average size of&#13;
household and average income for the village surveyed (Table 3). A&#13;
village's income per person, deflated by a rough-and-ready price&#13;
indicator to allow for the differences in survey years, in fact shows a&#13;
very weak (not significant even at 10%) negative link to the village's&#13;
mean household size. i/ So we must look at studies of small localities&#13;
to confirm that in today's LDCs it is poor households, and not just poor&#13;
places, that show higher MHS.&#13;
Direct local evidence for the Western Indian places,&#13;
comparable with the regional evidence of Table 2, is unfortunately&#13;
scarce, because most of the village surveys took place in the early&#13;
1960s, and at that time AERCs normally reported households grouped by&#13;
total, instead of per-person, income or outlay. The few Western Indian&#13;
studies giving an income-per-person scaling (V. Patel, 1980; B. Singh,&#13;
1981) do confirm, in total populations of a village, that poorer&#13;
households have larger MHS. Such an association is also shown for&#13;
individual villages or small groups of villages elsewhere in India&#13;
(Parthasarathy and Rama Rao, 1973, Table 8). Within each of two&#13;
villages in Bangladesh, too, "for the two most important food&#13;
consumption items - food and vegetables - the [regression] evidence is&#13;
very clear that larger families do worse" (Mahmud and McIntosh, 1980).&#13;
All these data measure MHS and requirements in numbers of&#13;
persons. Bigger households in LDCs nowadays tend to have lower income&#13;
or outlay per person. But big households also tend to have higher&#13;
child/adult ratios (Table 2 and pp. 43-4). Might this reduce&#13;
requirements per household sufficiently to render big households no&#13;
needier than small ones?&#13;
Table 4 represents the outcome of a crude attempt to see if&#13;
the size-poverty relationship among households also applies when size is&#13;
measured in "consumer units", weighted as in Schofield (1979, p. 149)&#13;
rather than in persons - and, incidentally, to provide further micro-&#13;
evidence of the size-poverty relationship, and to see if it applies to&#13;
Africa. A positive, localized link between poverty and household "size&#13;
in CUs" appears in these Zaria villages; the regressions of Table 4 are&#13;
supported by differences, significant at 5 percent, in MHS as between&#13;
(i) the poorest 20 percent of households by income-per-CU (8.5 CUs), and&#13;
(ii) the other 80 percent (6.1). This is confirmed in the three&#13;
villages in another area of Northern Nigeria, Sokoto; the respective&#13;
sizes were (i) 5.1 and (ii) 4.3. 10/ The positive size-poverty&#13;
relationship in Nigeria also seems to apply to urban data (Rouis, 1980,&#13;
p. 26), though the methodology is not entirely clear.&#13;
The NSS rounds also suggest that households with many persons&#13;
are in India relatively likely to reveal shortage of capacity to buy&#13;
calories per CU (Rao, 1979, p. 117). This also suggests that the&#13;
poverty-size relationship applies, even after the linkage of size to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
high child/adult ratios (and heneo lower requirements) is allowed for.&#13;
So does the greater vulnerability to illness, undernutrition and death&#13;
revealed by older siblings and large households (Birdsall, 1977, p. 75;&#13;
Lipton, 1983).&#13;
Three cautionary notes should be added. First, some large&#13;
households may alleviate poverty via scale-economies in consumption,&#13;
though these are probably small for poor households in LDCs (Sec.&#13;
IV(d)). Second, larger households tend to have more earners, and hence&#13;
may fail to report a greater proportion of ineome or outlay than smaller&#13;
households, especially if only one earner - normally the household head&#13;
- is interviewed (Cain, pers. comm., 1982); conversely, however, the&#13;
smaller and on balance better-off households are likelier to conceal&#13;
affluence from enquirers, for fear of taxation. Third, the positive&#13;
size-poverty link need not always be smooth. (i) In rural India, a big&#13;
1968 sample showed risk of being in the poorest household decile (or the&#13;
poorest 30%) by income-per-person steadily rising as household size&#13;
increased from 1 to 9, but it fell for very big households of 10 or more&#13;
(Gaiha and Kazmi, 1982, Table 9, pp. 24, 30, 32), and the linear&#13;
positive size-poverty link was accordingly braked by a negative link&#13;
between household size squared and poverty. (ii) In three villages in&#13;
Kano, N. Nigeria, AHS fell steadily as income-per-CU rose to the ninth&#13;
decile, but size increased in the highest income-per-CU decile (Norman,&#13;
1981, p. 76, citing Matlon). (iii) Above all, there is strong Indian&#13;
evidence (Table 12) that 1HS and poverty are unoorrelated for the&#13;
poorest 5-15 per cent in a State. 11/&#13;
Despite occasional doubts and some apparent exceptions, the&#13;
data at macro- and micro-level are clear enough to be fairly certain&#13;
that, as a general rule, poverty and large household size within a&#13;
locality go together. This is consistent with the new consensus that&#13;
average households are and were, in the great majority of countries,&#13;
small and nuclear; Table 2 shows even village average household sizes&#13;
varying from 3.97 to 7.27 across seventeen places in two Indian States&#13;
alone, and the further scope for intra-village (or intra-city) variation&#13;
leaves plenty of room for substantial variations, between poor and non-&#13;
poor households, in MHS.&#13;
The effects of this are dramatic. One example (of many that&#13;
could be given) comes from the sample of 4118 households in rural India&#13;
in 1968. Outlay-per-person fell below a plausible "poverty line" in 31&#13;
pereent of 1- and 2-person households, but in 88 percent of households&#13;
with 7 to 9 members (Gaiha and KAmmi, 1982, p. 18). The direction and&#13;
statistical significance - though not the size - of such effects of&#13;
household size upon the risk of falling below an income-per-person&#13;
("Actual income II") specification of the poverty-line appear to be&#13;
stable and consistent, both over time and as between major occupational&#13;
groups. Thus, for about 900 casual-labor households in rural India, a&#13;
rise of one person in MHS was associated (at the means) with a .17 rise&#13;
in the logarithm of the risk of poverty in 1968, and a .46 rise in 1970;&#13;
both associations were significant at 5%. For about 2350 cultivator&#13;
households, the respective figures were .0371 (10%) and .1654 (5%)&#13;
(Gaiha, 1983, Tables 18 and 19) - the lower impact here being probably&#13;
due to the association of more land with larger households (see fn. 8&#13;
above).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In explaining this positive sioe-poverty link - a reversal of&#13;
historioal experience - we need, however, also to confront the linkage&#13;
Of high-status groups to large household size. Here, apparently&#13;
inoonsistently, historioal experienoe persists still.&#13;
(o) High-status groups still tend to have bigger households&#13;
The historical evidenoe that high status accompanied large&#13;
household size was first oonvincingly marshaled for the English data by&#13;
Laslett (1965, 2nd. ed. 1971, pp. 26, 72). In Coodnestone-next-Wingham,&#13;
Kent, in 1676, three households of "gentry" averaged 9.0 persons; 26&#13;
yeomen's households, 5.8; 9 tradesmen's, 3.9; 12 laborers', 3.2; and 12&#13;
"poor men's", 2.1. Similar relationships applied to 100 English&#13;
parishes with relatively good data averaged over 1574-1821: gentry&#13;
6.65, yeomen 5.9, laborers 4.5, and so on, with samples sufficient to&#13;
ensure that inter-group differences are significant at 5 percent.&#13;
Similar relationships have sinoe been unoovered for many pre-&#13;
industrial and early-developing sooieties. Among 4808 households of&#13;
known occupation in Florenoe in 1427, nobles and lawyers (45 households)&#13;
averaged 5.8 persons per household, major crafts (483) 5.5, minor orafts&#13;
(841) 4.6, shopkeepers and servioes (1665) 4.3, farmers (24) 4.4, and&#13;
unskilled laborers and workers (1750) 3.7 (Klapisch, 1972, p. 277). In&#13;
the town of Romans in S.W. Franoe in 1586, the much higher propensity of&#13;
households of higher social status to include both resident servants and&#13;
extended kin (Ladurie, 1979, pp. 4-5) must have rendered them&#13;
considerably larger than other households, since both groups apparently&#13;
had similar and large numbers of children per household (ibid., p. 5).&#13;
In Japan around 1640-1720, status also appears to have affected inter-&#13;
village differences in household size, with prosperous comeroial and&#13;
fishing villages showing significantly bigger household averages than&#13;
poorer farming villages (Nakane, 1972, p. 521).&#13;
On status-size links, historical evidence for pre-industrial&#13;
and early developing societies is almost entirely supported by recent&#13;
evidence. After extensive review of Asian and African micro-data, one&#13;
author concludes: "In stratified societies, the upper status groups&#13;
tend to have larger domestic units" (Goody, 1972, p. 122). Since,&#13;
however, the evidenoe now reverses the finding - which seemed reasonable&#13;
when Goody wrote - that nowadays "richer ... farmers live in larger&#13;
groups than the average for Etheir] omunity" (ibid., p. 122), we need&#13;
to examine the status-size link separately from the poverty-size link,&#13;
for the two links now seem to pull household sizes in opposite&#13;
directiona.&#13;
Poorer people now tend to have bigger households. Yet so do&#13;
higher-status groups, on several indioators of status. Let us first&#13;
oonsider landholdilng. For 4118 rural households in India in 1968-70,&#13;
landlessness affeoted 65 percent of one-person households, 36 percent of&#13;
2-6 person households, and 21 percent of larger households; average&#13;
household size rose from 4.8 among households with below 1 ha. to 9.8&#13;
among households owning above 14.5 ha. (Gaiha and Kazmi, 1982, pp.22-3).&#13;
In big State samples, the simple r between (i) the midpoint of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
range of holding size reported for each of seven household groups and&#13;
(ii) that group's average household size was +.9486 in rural Gujarat and&#13;
+.9499 in rural Maharashtra. The addition of landless households, to&#13;
create an eighth pair of observations, hardly affects the results, which&#13;
remain significant at 1% (calculated from Visaria, 1978, Table 1).&#13;
Still in Western India (Table 3) but now at village level, laborers'&#13;
households - i.e. those deriving most income from employee work and thus&#13;
normally operating little land - were, in almost every village surveyed&#13;
in 1961-75, a good deal smaller than "owner-operator" households,&#13;
deriving most income from owned farmland. This is confirmed for ten&#13;
Central Gujarat villages in 1969-70 (Singh, 1980, p. 278), and for the&#13;
1970s for eight villages in coastal Andhra (Parthasarathy and Rama Rao,&#13;
1973, p. A-119); and in three Kerala districts marital fertility, both&#13;
in 1965-70 and in 1975-80, rose sharply and significantly as land owned&#13;
rose (Zachariah and Kurup, 1982, Table 3). 12/ Landholding and&#13;
household size were linked positively outside India - e.g. in a large&#13;
rural sample (Peach and Januszi, 1979, Table D-1) and in two villages&#13;
(Mahmud and McIntosh, 1980, p. 506), in Bangladesh; and in three&#13;
villages in Sokoto, N. Nigeria (Norman et al., 1976, pp.32, 37; 47, 58;&#13;
71, 83).&#13;
Suggestive evidence extends this positive link of household&#13;
size to assets, beyond farmland. Larger households have been associated&#13;
with a greater incidence of plough ownership (Katsina, N. Nigeria, 1967:&#13;
Anthony and Johnston, 1968, p. 48a); of livestock (Corsica 1769-71:&#13;
Dupaquier and Jadin, 1972, p. 295); and of total wealth (Florence 1427 -&#13;
though completely assetless households were somewhat larger than those&#13;
with few assets: Klapisch, 1972, p. 277). These relationships may be&#13;
partly life-cyclical. In rural Botswana, increasing age of male&#13;
household heads, and presumably average household size, accompany "rapid&#13;
asset growth" (Kossoudji and Mueller, 1980, p. 22). Both in Karnataka&#13;
and in parts of Nigeria, parental house space - itself a major asset by&#13;
value - appears to affect the age at which adult children are pressed to&#13;
form separate households (J. Caldwell, pers. comm., Dec. 1982).&#13;
Occupational structure, like asset-holding, strongly links&#13;
high status with large family size, in both historical and recent&#13;
studies. The data from Florence in 1427 (p. 11) are echoed in recent&#13;
work; for example, in the Central Provinces of Kenya in 1971-2, the size&#13;
of rural laborer households averaged 4.88, and of cultivator households&#13;
6.07 (Collier and Lal, 1980, p. 40). Table 3 provides telling evidence&#13;
that, in specific Western Indian villages around 1962-75, households&#13;
depending for most of their income upon owner-cultivation, trade,&#13;
transport, and the professions were significantly bigger than laborer&#13;
households. Laborers and cultivators, respectively, averaged over 13&#13;
villages in Gujarat (at various dates between 1961 and 1973), numbered&#13;
4.8 and 6.6 persons per household; over 7 villages in Rajasthan the&#13;
respective averages were 5.1 and 6.0 (Table 3). Both differences were&#13;
significant at 1%, and were found in a large majority of individual&#13;
villages. Singh (1981, p. 278) reports similar findings in ten Central&#13;
Gujarat villages in 1969-70. The difference, like the ambivalent&#13;
position of craft households, appears also to apply in Southern&#13;
Karnataka (J. Caldwellp pers. comm., Dec. 1982). 13/ Generally we know&#13;
too little about the relationship of household size and structure to&#13;
oooupations. It is an important issue, affecting the viability for poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
households of alternative forms of informal-sector family enterprise.&#13;
However, the correlation between high-status work and large households&#13;
is clear.&#13;
Western Indian caste structure, for twelve villages in the&#13;
1960s, provides a parallel link between bigger and high-caste households&#13;
(Table 5). "Intermediate caste" households comprise mostly the dominant&#13;
farmer castes, such as the Jats. They are substantially bigger than&#13;
"other" (i.e. lower-caste), scheduled-caste, and non-Hindu households in&#13;
the Gujarat villages, and somewhat bigger in Rajasthan. These groups&#13;
comprise the overwhelming majority of Indians classified by religion or&#13;
caste, and confirm the general "high status - big households" rule;&#13;
interestingly, in these villages, a few of the highest-status groups&#13;
(Brahmans, Banias, Jains) 14/ appear to be exceptions, showing&#13;
relatively small households. This may be a typical phenomenon, though&#13;
the exception for Brahmans is also claimed by Kolenda (A. Shah, 1973, p.&#13;
224); Oscar Lewis's classic North Indian study, for "Rampur" in 1953,&#13;
shows the 15 Brahman households averaging 7.3 members, not far below the&#13;
78 Jat households (8.3) and well above the 38 scheduled-caste households&#13;
(5.2) (cited in Goody, 1972, p. 113). A Tibetan village also shows a&#13;
clear link between big households and high status (Carrasco, 1959, pp.&#13;
67-9).&#13;
Female-headedness is also associated with low social and&#13;
political status in most underdeveloped communities. For obvious&#13;
reasons, female-headedness is also associated with small household size.&#13;
This was true historically, e.g. in early-industrializing Rheims in 1802&#13;
(Fauve-Chamoux, 1983, p. 480). In today's LICs, Visaria (1980, p. 59).&#13;
shows dramatic declines in the proportion of female heads as household&#13;
size increased for ten large South Asian samples in 1968-74: for&#13;
example, in rural Maharashtra (1972-3), females comprised 61 per cent of&#13;
one-person, 6 per cent of five-person, and 2 percent of nine-person&#13;
household heads; in Malaysia (1973) the corresponding figures were 35&#13;
percent, 15 percent, and 12 percent. In Botswana, the 1974-5 Rural&#13;
Income Distribution Survey (1974-5) also showed that female-headed&#13;
households were smaller, but only if no adult male was present: the 47%&#13;
of households with a resident male head averaged 7.3 members; the 14%&#13;
that were female-headed but contained a resident adult male, 7.6; and&#13;
the 29% female-headed without a resident adult male, only 5.1 (Kossoudji&#13;
and Mueller, 1980, p. 11).&#13;
We can now state, quite sharply, a demographic paradox of&#13;
poverty in today's LDCs. In total populations, larger households tend&#13;
to be poorer (the opposite of most historical situations). Yet many&#13;
status-scalings - by land owned or operated, by wealth, by type of work,&#13;
by caste or other social status, by sex of household head - link low&#13;
status, now as in the historical past, to smaller households. In&#13;
analyzing this apparent contradiction, we shall come to understand much&#13;
about the demographic characteristics of the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
(d) Poverty, status and household size: possible explanations&#13;
It is useful to distinguish seven demographic variables, related to&#13;
MRS, and eaoh possibly related also to poverty. Each variable may help or&#13;
hinder our task of explaining why poverty, in LICs now but not in NDCs in the&#13;
past, goes with large MIS; or why low asset and job status goes with small&#13;
MS; or both. The first six household variables affect principally the size&#13;
of the family, i.e. the numbers of coresident kin. Only the seventh variable&#13;
explicitly deals with household members who are not family members.&#13;
The first three variables are standard demographic indicators.&#13;
First, mortality risks over a lifetime may vary with the level of poverty;&#13;
usually this applies much more to infant, and to a lesser extent child,&#13;
mortality than at later ages. Seoond, live births per year per cohabiting&#13;
couple, given the oouple's ages, oan differ between poor and other persons or&#13;
groups. Third, the duration of cohabitation 15/ can vary - can start or end&#13;
at a different average age, oan be interrupted with different frequency, or&#13;
can show different (usually small) probabilities of not happening at all.&#13;
Fourth - if we turn to variables affecting demography indirectly,&#13;
i.e. not by changing birth or death rates instantaneously - rich and poor&#13;
persons or groups may show different propensities to form separate households&#13;
when the ohildren marry, or (if they do not at once separate) different&#13;
periods of complex family living. (Complex families, of this "multiple"&#13;
nature or otherwise, 16/ are likely to imply larger households in three ways,&#13;
as compared with nuclear families: directly, by retaining the child and adding&#13;
a spouse; by increasing the proportion of fertile couples; and by changing the&#13;
mortality risk of the household). Fifth, sets of households may differ in&#13;
respect of in-migration or out-migration. Sixth, their household size may&#13;
reflect, not lifelong associations with them of their members, but temporary&#13;
passage through parts of a life-cycle. For example, laborers may tend to&#13;
average smaller MES because they are "waiting" to inherit parents' land, to&#13;
enlarge their households by having children, and to move from the status-group&#13;
of "laborer" to that of "owner-cultivator".&#13;
Our final variable allows for possible inequality between household&#13;
and co-resident family. One set, A, of households may be more likely to&#13;
include non-family members - espeoially resident servants or lodgers - than&#13;
another set, B. This normally has a "double-geared" effect on MHS differences&#13;
between the sets, for set B is then normally more likely to out household&#13;
size, e.g. as adolesoents leave B to go into domestic service with set A.&#13;
There is no reason why just one of these seven variables should help&#13;
to explain either or both parts of our paradox. Nor need every variable even&#13;
point in the right direotion (i.e. associate large ISHS with poverty in LICs&#13;
now, affluence in NDC history, or high status). Indeed, both these things are&#13;
very unlikely. Reality is more usually messy than elegant.&#13;
Moreover, this partioular (sevenfold) classification of correlates of&#13;
household size has no logioal primacy; it just happens to follow one pattern&#13;
of frequently available recent data. Logioally, one could as well separate&#13;
faotors causing household formation, household separation, and household size&#13;
between formation and separation. Relevant, too, are the classifioations of&#13;
successful historical "predictors" of mean household size for communities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
i.e. urban or rural plaoes: for 382 places in Suwa county, Japant in 1671-1870&#13;
(Hayami and Uohida, 1972, pp. 488-92), and 100 in England in 1574-1821&#13;
CLaslett, 1972, p. 155). The only comon successful "prediotors" were the&#13;
proportions of households headed by married oouples (r 2 .600 on MRS for&#13;
Japan, .296 for England) and with servants (.444 and .599). Vhiohever way one&#13;
outs the oake, it is of major analytical and polioy importance which potential&#13;
correlates turn out in fact to be associated with different household size.&#13;
(e) Mortality, poverty and mean household size (IMS)&#13;
Historical data, permitting inferenoes about group differenoes in&#13;
age-specific mortality within NDCs during the pre-industrial or&#13;
early-industrializing periods, are scarce and controversial. Howevert there&#13;
are two prima facie reasons to believe that the ratios of poor or low-status&#13;
households' death-rates to those of other households, for most age-groups,&#13;
were substantially lower for NDCs, especially in the pre-industrial period,&#13;
than in today's LDCs. First, many killing infeotions and other tranmissible&#13;
diseases, from bubonic plague to malaria, are not so very different, in&#13;
incidence or in virulence, as between a country's gentry and laborera, or rich&#13;
and poor. It is above all such diseases whose incidence, and hence&#13;
contribution to death-rates, has plummeted worldwide since the late nineteenth&#13;
century. j1/ Second, knowledge about how to avoid other diseases, notably&#13;
puerperal fever, dysentery and TB, has advanoed enormouslyt as between NDC&#13;
pre-industrial history and today's LDCs. Thus better-off or better-educated&#13;
people in poor countries have become able to greatly reduce their risks - e.g.&#13;
by boiling drinking-water, by purohasing hygienic ohildbirth, or by ohoosing&#13;
to live in a suburb with better sewerage.&#13;
Certainly, at the crudest level of comparison, country cross-sections&#13;
today reveal strong links between mortality and severe potential poverty as&#13;
suggested by low real GNP per person. As a country's GNP per person, in&#13;
oonstant 1963 prioes, "rose" to about $400-500, but not for further rises,&#13;
there were big mortality "declines" both in the 19305 and - from a lower baset&#13;
due to an improved health environment - in the 1960s (Preston, oited in&#13;
Schultz, 1981, p. 117).&#13;
Let us assume (until p. 18) that groups with death-rates above the&#13;
national average do not offset this by also featuring higher fortility,&#13;
greater household complexity, or other faotors tending to pull MRS up. In&#13;
that case, high-mortality groups will also feature low MRS. Indeed, the&#13;
younger the ages at which a group suffera abnormally high rates of death, the&#13;
greater is the proportionate out in the group's MRS.&#13;
In LDCs today, inter-group variation in mortality is muoh greater in&#13;
early life. The relatively reliable Sample Registration Survey (SRS) showed&#13;
that inter-State male infant mortality rates (CIIs) in 1972 ranged from 75 in&#13;
Kerala to 210 in Uttar Pradesh (the respective female IMRs were 62 and 259);&#13;
at age 5, male life expectanoy was 61.8 in Kerala and 55.9 in UP (female, 60.7&#13;
and 49.9) (Dyson, 1979, cited in Ruzicka, 1982, Table 8). A 1979 Indian&#13;
survey covering some 750,000 SRS households found proportionate gaps, by&#13;
caste, maternal education, and looal infrastructure, in IMRs well above the&#13;
gaps in death-rates at ages 1-4 (Ruzicka, 1982, Table 9) and even these gaps&#13;
were well above any that are plausible at later ages. African mortality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
estimates are generally much less reliable, but again suggest that - with the&#13;
important exception of West Africa - differences in infant and child mortality&#13;
account for the great mass of differences in life expectation at birth, and&#13;
that inter-country and probably inter-group differences in adult mortality are&#13;
relatively very small (A. Hill, 1981, pp. 32-4, 79-84).   To the extent that&#13;
inter-household mortality differences are not compensated - or are less than&#13;
fully compensated - by other differences affecting household size, the&#13;
earliness of high and differential death risks in LDCs must mean that they&#13;
greatly affect inter-group variation in MHS.&#13;
But how do groups of households in LDCs vary in respect of death&#13;
risks? First, one should refer to an unusual yet important effect: unusual in&#13;
that it tends to cut MHS in poorer and lower-status households by raising&#13;
their adult, as well as infant and child, mortality. African research "has&#13;
universally found that mortality at all ages is substantially lower in urban&#13;
areas than in rural areas" (A. Hill, 1981, p. 35). In India, there is&#13;
"indisputably higher [age-specific] mortality of rural [persons) at every&#13;
age-group compared to urban" (Mitra, 1978, p. 223); indeed, for under-fives,&#13;
and less certainly for adult men, the gap substantially widened in the 1970s&#13;
(Ruzicka, 1982, Tables 5-6). Poor households, and poor people, are in most&#13;
regions heavily over-represented in rural areas, so that higher rural&#13;
death-risks - assuming no, or incomplete, compensation via fertility or&#13;
otherwise - would mean smaller rural households. This is a powerful effect,&#13;
because (while also affecting adults) excess rural mortality still strikes&#13;
infants hardest - IMRs, in two good Indian surveys in early the 1970s, were&#13;
136 and 137 in rural areas, but 90 and 92 in towns (Natrajan, n.d., p. 7).&#13;
The effect of death-rate differences, in making rural households&#13;
smaller than urban, should apply especially to poor people, who have much&#13;
greater difficulty than the better-off in escaping from such risks by using&#13;
modern public-health, medical, or nutritional assets or knowledge. The&#13;
recency of many African conurbations, however, and the consequent large&#13;
proportion of recent immigrants with incomplete or single households, means&#13;
that African data are unsuitable to check this proposition. Indian data,&#13;
though, do support it.&#13;
It is not only that Indian urban households show MHS significantly,&#13;
and probably increasingly, above rural levels; this does probably mean, among&#13;
other things, that urban status raises MHS by reducing depletion by death,&#13;
especially child death. More tellingly, as poverty worsens, Indian urban MHS&#13;
rises much more steeply than rural - so that in some States well-off urban&#13;
households are actually smaller than rural households with similar MEP,&#13;
although poor urban households are much bigger than their equally poor rural&#13;
counterparts (Table 2). This is largely due to the high child/adult ratio of&#13;
the urban poor. Their children - and to a lesser extent their adults - are&#13;
far likelier to survive in cities than in villages (the exact reverse of the&#13;
position in industrialising England: McKeown, 1979, p. 76). In today's LICs,&#13;
once towns do not comprise mainly recent immigrants, urban status tends to&#13;
confer (i) relatively greater real MEP, given household size; (ii) for this&#13;
and other reasons, lower death-risk, given real MDP; (iii) for poorer people,&#13;
a large MHS (as more children, especially, survive), relative both to&#13;
less-poor townspeople and to equally poor villagers. Poorer households are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
bigger, in both town and country; but urban residence confers on the poor the&#13;
capacity to avoid many child deaths that they would suffer in the villages,&#13;
and thus makes their households relatively bigger still.&#13;
A second possible "group link" of status to household size is via&#13;
differential female mortality. Especially among girls, female excess&#13;
mortality in some parts of India and Bangladesh (Miller, 1982; Chen et al.,&#13;
1981) is undoubted. However, its causes are disputed, and "there is no trace&#13;
in African data of ... marked systematic female disadvantage in mortality&#13;
(Hill, 1981, p. 35). Even in the few parts of South Asia where households&#13;
have been shown to discriminate against the survival chances of girls, it is&#13;
unclear whether this discrimination especially cuts MHS in poorer or&#13;
lower-status households (Chen et al., 1981; Levinson, cited in Carloni, 1981;&#13;
Lipton, 1983) or in higher-status ones (Miller, 1982, and the evidence there&#13;
cited). Hence the effect on the size-poverty relationship of India's higher&#13;
rural female mortality in all age-groups from birth up to 34 years (Mitra,&#13;
1978, p. 223), accompanying a higher propensity among Indian rural females to&#13;
be in smaller households, is not clear. Moreover, evidence from Western&#13;
India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Taiwan and Malaysia clearly shows that women are not&#13;
over-represented in the lower deciles of households by MEP (Visaria, 1980,&#13;
p. 60).&#13;
So urban "status" lowers death-risk; usually raises settled MHS; and&#13;
(at least in India) especially raises MHS among the poor. Female status&#13;
(while seldom affecting death-risk much) sometimes raises it; is associated&#13;
with membership of lower-MHS households with high proportions of females; but&#13;
appears unrelated to household poverty, though certainly not to individual&#13;
female disadvantage (Lipton, 1983a). What of gaps between groups more overtly&#13;
linked with poverty or status? In 1978, scheduled castes showed IMRs of 159&#13;
in rural India, as against 136 for Hindus (but 108 for the generally poorer&#13;
Muslims: Ruzicka, 1982, Table 9). In rural Karnataka (Mysore) in 1961,&#13;
laborers and "temporary tenants" had IMRs over 67% higher than&#13;
owner-cultivators farming over 3 acres or "permanent tenants" with over 3&#13;
acres. A recent analysis of child mortality in two States, based on the 1951&#13;
Census, shows that the proportion of children dying before the age of 5 was&#13;
then 10% higher among farm laborers than among farm operators in Madhya&#13;
Pradesh, and 42% higher (on a much lower base - of about half the rate) in&#13;
Kerala (Mitra, 1978, p. 21; Natrajan, n.d., p. 12). This should be set&#13;
against the evidence that only the nutritional status associated with extreme&#13;
poverty - such as afflicts 10-15% of Indians (and at most 20% of children) -&#13;
increases infant and child mortality (Chen, 1980, pp. 1836-45; Lipton, 1983,&#13;
pp. 21-3). Thus these differences in rates of infant mortality must be&#13;
associated with a very great overlap between the high-mortality groups and the&#13;
extremely poor.&#13;
In urban and rural Karnataka, moreover, housing-related indicators of&#13;
economic levels - such as are likely to discriminate between poor, poorest and&#13;
other - were linked strongly, in the expected direotion, to both infant and&#13;
overall death-rates (Mitra, 1978, p. 210), and this also applied to a 1978&#13;
all-India survey for IMRs: in rural areas, living in a village with&#13;
electricity, water-supply or medical faoilities was associated with IMRs lower&#13;
by about 30 percent (Ruzicka, 1982, Table 9).&#13;
An Indonesian study implicitly relates the large urban-rural gap in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
survivorship ratios in 1972-3 to higher urban levels of maternal eduoation -&#13;
itself largely a surrogate for income; holding the mother's education and&#13;
income constant, we find that the urban-rural mortality gap vanishes&#13;
(calculated from Hull and Hull, 1976, pp. 8, 15). In Afrioan studies,&#13;
"mortality is also invariably lower among children of women with education"&#13;
(A. Hill, 1981, P. 35). In India in 1978, rural IDR was 132 for children born&#13;
to illiterate mothers, but 64 where mothers had completed primary oducation;&#13;
the comparable urban rates were 81 and 49 (Rusicka, 1982, Table 9).&#13;
Do these relationships help to explain the links between poverty and&#13;
MRS? Higher infant and child mortality - and slightly higher subsequent&#13;
mortality - among poor groups, and poor households in total populations,&#13;
obviously outs MS1, relative to other households, direotly. Thus the&#13;
relatively high IKR among laborers (and probably among the associated castes),&#13;
rural women, villagers, the ill-housed, ete., does directly relate to their&#13;
smaller MHS. It renders smaller households for low-status groups easier to&#13;
explain - and for less-poor persons, harder. If indeed receding tides of&#13;
general infection and ignorance have left, even more important than in the&#13;
past, those life-threatening illnesses best avoided by adequate education or&#13;
income (p. 15), then the growing direct effect of differential death-risk in&#13;
reducing poor people's MHS poverty to low 141 (though it could explain why the&#13;
very poorest households (fn. 11), where alone IIIR shoots up, are still no&#13;
larger than the other poor). However, the direct effect is not the whole&#13;
story. Higher mortality in poor households might "trigger" indirect responses&#13;
that actually raised HBS relative to other households. This is very unlikely&#13;
to operate via a positive effect of mortality upon household complexity.&#13;
Indeed, since lower life expectancy means that parents of resident married&#13;
children die sooner, it implies - under most norms of household formation -&#13;
fewer complex (and thus normally even smaller) households for poor and/or&#13;
low-status persons. However, simulations suggest that such effects, even from&#13;
big differences in mortality, are very small (Wachter and Hammell, 1978,&#13;
p. 48).&#13;
More important, however, is a much more plausible way in which the&#13;
higher mortality of low-status households can actually raise their MRS: by&#13;
triggering sufficient higher fertility, via either longer cohabitation or&#13;
higher fecundity (sections (f)-(g)). The apparently higher mortality, within&#13;
each job and status group, at low income and asset levels may be outweighed by&#13;
higher fertility - replacement fertility on insuranaee principles (Cassen,&#13;
1978, pp. 60-61), or due to earlier cessation of post-partum amenorrhoea as&#13;
infants die. Thus higher mortality in poor households, paradoxically, could&#13;
help explain why their MHS tends to be larger in total populations, and&#13;
therefore a fortiori within most income or status-groups.&#13;
(f) Fertility and the poor&#13;
1. Direct impaot on household size&#13;
Households with higher fertility, unless it is outweighed by other&#13;
factors, are bigger households. Japanese historial evicence suggests that, in&#13;
the long run, it is not outweighed, though short-run localized links of&#13;
fertility to family size are rather weak (Haysmi and Uohida, 1972, p. 496).&#13;
In today's LDCs, where infant mortality has fallen, greater or lesser&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
responsive deolines in fertility could well be a min explanation of why&#13;
household sizes differ.&#13;
The number of ohildren born to a woman in her life is the outcome of&#13;
her age of menarohe, her age of menopause, frequenoy of lnteroourse between&#13;
those ages, proportion leading to conoeptions, and proportion of oonoeptions&#13;
followed by oampleted pregnancy. Unfortunately, very few data sets analyse&#13;
these variables separately. More usual is clasaifioation of rural or urban&#13;
women, sometimes by age-groups, by (i) numbers of ohildren ever-born, dealt&#13;
with in this section; and (ii) age of marriage (Section (g)). Both these&#13;
olassifications are sometimes further broken down by income or outlay per&#13;
person in the woman's household, by the household's apparent main oocupation&#13;
or social group, or by the level of motherts or father's education (of course&#13;
closely linked to inome-per-person). Another approach seeks to disoover&#13;
whether the poorer, lower-statua, or otherwise "different" woan also differs&#13;
in respeot of "intervening variables" affecting either children ever-born to&#13;
her per year of sexually aotive union, or else proportion of her life spent in&#13;
such union; auch variables are physical fecundity, marital disruption, and&#13;
post-partum abstinence (Hull and Hull, 1976, p. 19, fn.; Davis and Blake,&#13;
1956). Finally, income or status-group might be related to such aspects of&#13;
fertility through physioal determination, or through optimising choloes aa&#13;
stressed by the "Yale school" (Schultz, 1981).&#13;
The balance of evidence (Birdsall, 1974, pp. 5-79 and 1980, pp. 53-6;&#13;
Hull and Hull, 1976, p. 9) suggests an "inverted-U" overall income-fertility&#13;
relationship. This almost certainly holds across LDCa. National fertility&#13;
probably rises as annual average income-per-person rises up to a low threshold&#13;
(perhaps $125 in East Asia and $300 in Latin Amerloap in 1965 prioes), mainly&#13;
because, below that threshold, some women's physioal fecundity is reduced by&#13;
severe undernutrition (sometimes by famine) and by disease. However, once&#13;
that threshold of poverty is surpassed, increasing inome-per-person - being&#13;
associated with higher levels of female education, lower infant and child&#13;
mortality, and (as schools replace ohild-labor) a rising opportunity-oost of&#13;
ohildren - reduces fertility, though at a falling rate as a family approaohes&#13;
levels of reasonably adequate living.&#13;
Broadly, often strongly, supportive evidence for part or all of this&#13;
relationship is available from cross-sections within LDCa, viz. Iran, India,&#13;
Puerto Rico, Turkey, the Philippines and Taiwan (Birdsall, 1974, 1980).&#13;
Karnataka in 1961 appeared exactly to oonfirm the "inverted U'. Bangalore,&#13;
presumably the best-off city, showed a clear positive link between apparent&#13;
fertility and likely poverty - the 7% of women in the worst housing showed a&#13;
25% higher orude birth-rate than the remaining 93%; in other town, no clear&#13;
relationship prevailed; and in the relatively poor rural areas, very low&#13;
socio-economic status acaompanied lower lifetime fertility. There, women over&#13;
15 in households deriving income mainly as "agricultural laborers and&#13;
temporary tenants' averaged 6% fewer ohildren than "owner-oultivators with&#13;
less than 3 acres and permanent tenants with less than 5 acres" and 12.5%&#13;
fewer than larger cultivators - highly significant figures for such big&#13;
amples - and sharedt respectivelyt 16% and 25% lower birth-rates per woman&#13;
aged 15-44 (Mitrat 1978, pp. 209-10).&#13;
A similar pattern prevailed in Colombia. Age-speolfi fertility is&#13;
negatively assoolated with both husband's and wifets wage-rate in towns - but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
positively (except for younger wives) in the (much poorer) rural areas&#13;
(Schultz, 1981, p. 177). 18/&#13;
One tentative interpretation is this. Laborers - and presumably the&#13;
associated social (e.g. caste) groups - suffer higher infant and child&#13;
mortality than cultivators. While they sometimes compensate via higher&#13;
fertility - marital fertility differentials by easte in Kerala (Zachariah and&#13;
Kurup, 1982, Table 2) being an example - the very poorest often, far from&#13;
over-insuring (p. 23), show lower fertility. Hence, in part, the inter-group&#13;
link between low status and low household size. However, poorer people&#13;
(though not the very poorest) within each job and status group not only show&#13;
rather higher infant and child mortality rates, but "overcompensate" with&#13;
higher replacement fertility, both because of shorter post-partum amenorrhoea&#13;
due to higher IMRs, and to insure against them. Hence, in part, the&#13;
intra-group (and aggregate) link between poverty and high household size. The&#13;
weakness of this link for the very poorest (fn. 11) could be explained by&#13;
their concentration in low-status groups.&#13;
Work in the Punjab (Wyon and Gordon, 1971; Kielmann et al., 1978)&#13;
appears to support this. Moreover, the data from Matar Taluka in rural&#13;
Gujarat (1965-75) suggest that the intra-group relationship is strongest at&#13;
the low end of the income scale - among the poorest, and some of the poor -&#13;
and that their higher replacement fertility tends to inhibit asset formation&#13;
and keep these poorest poor (Repetto and Deolalikar, n.d., p. 57). This&#13;
higher fertility reflects (i) (perfectly rational) over-insurance against what&#13;
are, for the very poorest who alone are at poverty-induced nutritional threat&#13;
to infant life, genuinely higher risks, and (ii) the low net costs of small&#13;
children in these groups (Cassen, 1978).&#13;
Extreme poverty, at least, however, does also have links to factors&#13;
that reduce fertility, and hence, other things being equal, family size.&#13;
Severe undernutrition probably reduces fecundity, retards menarche (first&#13;
menstruation), reduces fecundity between menarche and menopause, and&#13;
accelerates menopause (Friach, 1978, 1980, 1982). Fertility may also increase&#13;
directly with hygiene in ways especially discriminating against the poorest.&#13;
Several fertility indicators in Kerala in 1965-80 were positively linked to&#13;
house quality variables, especially to toilet facilities (Zachariah and Kurup,&#13;
1982, Table 3).&#13;
Apart from such extreme physical fertility effects, choice by poorer&#13;
couples occasionally also reduces fertility. They are likelier to be&#13;
temporarily separated by the migration of just one partner. They also - as in&#13;
a village in Central Java in 1972-3 - feature much greater voluntary&#13;
post-partum abstinence, and more marital disruption. Nevertheless, in the&#13;
same village, poorer couples show shorter interpregnancy intervals (Hull and&#13;
Hull, pp. 26-9). If we judge by worldwide KAP survey evidence, the poor&#13;
normally make less use of the more modern and effective methods of&#13;
contraception. There is no doubt that the poor, but not always the poorest,&#13;
show higher marital fertility in the great majority of LIC situations.&#13;
One interpretation of the inverse-U relationship between fertility&#13;
(y) and income per person (x) is suggested by the strong positive link between&#13;
child wage-rates and couple fertility (Schultz, 1981, pp. 50-1). This link&#13;
could well associate fertility with poverty, by leading poor couples (for whom&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
alone child labor is an important income source - Lipton, 1983a, Sec. II(d) -&#13;
since others are likelier to prefer to postpone and enlarge income benefits by&#13;
educating their children) to choose higher fertility. However, the&#13;
correlation could also associate fertility among the poor with escape from&#13;
extreme poverty, as children's earnings - net of child costs - raised&#13;
household income-per-CU for the more fertile poor. Like the extreme physical&#13;
effects, this may help to account for the inverse-U relationship.&#13;
In the NW Indian villages, the very poorest are likeliest to be&#13;
"isolated" from the rest of the population in a group with distinct job,&#13;
status, and assets: the low-caste landless laborers. If this is generally the&#13;
case, then the inverse-U shaped fertility-income function could be a "linkerw,&#13;
helping to explain both legs of our central puzzle (p. 13). Over most of the&#13;
range, fertility tends to fall as income-per-CU rises; but for, say, the&#13;
poorest 10-20 percent, who tend to be in a separate status-group (especially&#13;
at the very poorest "end"), the reverse relationship may apply. For the whole&#13;
population, a positive fertility-poverty correlation would be found (as in the&#13;
Kerala sample: Zachariah and Kurup, 1982, Table 2), because of the dominance&#13;
of the "less-poor 80%" in the regressions; but, as between groups, the overlap&#13;
of low-status and very poor households could connect very low status to&#13;
somewhat lower fertility. This is consistent with the weakening of&#13;
MHS-poverty relationships among the ultra-poor (fn. 11).&#13;
How might parental choice link larger household size, via higher&#13;
fertility, to (A) poorer families in LDCs now, (B) better-off families in the&#13;
pre-industrial past of now-rich countries (Klapisch, 1972, p. 274; Laslett,&#13;
1972, pp. 153-4), (C) higher-status families, usually now, almost always in&#13;
the past? The "Yale school" seeks to interpret data as if couples choose, at&#13;
the same time, probable family size - partly by weighting expected couple&#13;
income from children's work against costs of parental time spent in child care&#13;
- and couple income and leisure. It is also argued that the effect of reduced&#13;
poverty "on fertility depends on the source of the increment to income, and&#13;
hence the 'price-of-time effect'", i.e. the opportunity-cost of extra child&#13;
care, "embodied in that source". It is argued that, unless extra couple&#13;
income is achieved in ways that would be inhibited by extra child care, it&#13;
will not affect fertility and thus household size: "Would we expect fertility&#13;
in ... Libya to fall because per capita incomes are among the highest in the&#13;
world?" (Schultz, 1981, p. 5). 19/ This explanation of (A) above, by&#13;
reference mainly to substitution of (high) earnings for child-care in&#13;
better-off households, but not in worse-off ones - this virtual denial of&#13;
income-effect - could acount for (A) alone. It could also handle (B) above,&#13;
albeit tortuously, e.g. if it were argued that the greater prevalence of&#13;
servants in the pre-industrial West drastically cut costs of marginal&#13;
child-care for the rich, but not for the poor, as compared with LDCs today;&#13;
better-off children's higher potential earnings could perhaps have weighed&#13;
more heavily then (making richer couples relatively fertile), although their&#13;
higher potential opportunity-costs do so now (making richer couples choose&#13;
lower fertility).&#13;
However, it is hard to expel income-effect from the voluntarist&#13;
account of (A) above. Partly this is because of three sorts of evidence that&#13;
income-effect induces women to divert time away from work - evidence that&#13;
should apply just as well to the decision to have more children. (i) As&#13;
income-per-CU rises, women withdraw from the workforce, though potential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
earning presumably rise. (li) This Is also true as women transfer from&#13;
village to town (Lipton, 1983a, Seo. 11(d)). (iii) And female education -&#13;
which plainly raises potential earnings - does not significantly out&#13;
age-specific maternal fertility if the education ends before primary&#13;
oompletion, or at all for older rural women (Stycos et al., 1978, for Costa&#13;
Rica; Schultz, 1981, pp. 120-1, for Colombia; Zaohariah and Kurup, Table 2,&#13;
for marital fertility aged 20-40 in Kerala; Hull and Hull, p. 10, for&#13;
Indonesia). 20/ Partly, to explain (A) above via parental response to the&#13;
cost of child care (higher in riher households if, but only if, mothers could&#13;
earn more than in poorer ones) - via pure substitution-effeot without&#13;
income-effect - is implausible because of (C) above. Higher status,&#13;
work-group, or access to earned assets must often be associated more&#13;
convincingly with potential earnings (foregone in the event of child oare)&#13;
than is higher income-per-CU. Yet such sooial differentiation is associated&#13;
with bigger households, more fertility, and more child-care in the&#13;
higher-status groups: the reverse of what substitution-effeot alone would&#13;
induce. We do know that normal negative substitution-effect relates female&#13;
wage-rates to female partioipation rates (e.g. Smith (ed.), 1980; Quizon and&#13;
Evenson, 1982); hence, both in (C) above and in regard to the three types of&#13;
evidence listed, we can be oonfident that effects other than&#13;
substitution-effect are at work in the opposite direotion.&#13;
Moreover, we may need to explain fertility differences among status,&#13;
job, and asset olasses by sooial variables, not just by income and&#13;
substitution effects. It Is quite plausible to reconoile (A), (B) and (C)&#13;
above by hypothesizing that (A) is due to income and substitution effects&#13;
together; that the price of child-eare, relative to the discounted potential&#13;
earnings of ohildren, was much lower for the rich, as compared to the poor, in&#13;
the pro-industrial West than in today's LDCs, explaining (B); but that&#13;
status-groups generate habits, expectations and norms regarding fertility,&#13;
explaining (C). All this is tentative, almost speculative, partly because&#13;
data are soaroe. However, differential fertility of unions - and its links,&#13;
biological or sooio-economio, to poverty, nutrition and health, and&#13;
job-asset-status group - should prove oruoial in reoonoiling the apparent&#13;
paradox on p. 13.&#13;
2.    Links between fertilitr and mortality&#13;
An with mortality, so with fertility: we have concentrated on its&#13;
direct links with household size, as they might render poorer households&#13;
bigger (or households with poverty-related status, job or asset positions&#13;
smaller) than others. Indireot links might assooiate mortality or fertility&#13;
with the size of such households either via the prooess of household formation&#13;
and division, or via reciprocal effeots between fertility and mortality. It&#13;
is hard to see how different household formation rules or timings oould&#13;
greatly affeot mortality or fertility; and, though it is quite conceivable&#13;
that ohanges in mortality or fertility could alter family size by changing the&#13;
time during which a household is simple or complex (e.g. if high death-rates&#13;
swiftly eliminate the patriarch ln a multiple family 21/), simulation shows&#13;
that this does not make much difference for plausible values (Wachter and&#13;
Hamrell, 1978).  Hence  indireot links", if important, must be between&#13;
fertility and mortallty.&#13;
For example, If a child's death oaused Its parents to inorease&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
planned births by more than one - e.g. beoause it improved the peroeived oase&#13;
for insurancep in order to achieve a given completed family size norm - that&#13;
death might inorease family size. If so, higher ohild mortality among poor&#13;
households would not out their sizoe as our oeteris paribus presentation on&#13;
pp. 18-22 has implied. Many links between mortality and fertility -&#13;
biologioal or economio-optimising, in both causal directions, and with either&#13;
positive or negative sign - have been hypothesised (an exoellent sumary is&#13;
Nugent and Walther, 1981, pp. 29-33).&#13;
Such links can be collapsed into two sets. Via replacement effeots&#13;
of mortality on fertility, extra children are produoed to compensate for past&#13;
child deaths (partly, wholly, or, as above, more than wholly). Via crowdina&#13;
effects of fertility on mortality, more ohildren in a family alter - normally,&#13;
inorease - the death-risks to the siblings and, exoept possibly for the seoond&#13;
pregnanoy, to the mother in childbirth. Replacement effects arise partly as&#13;
deliberately-chosen compensation, and partly because pregnancy prospeots&#13;
increase when suckling ceases. In the Kerala study in 1981-82 "the average&#13;
birth interval was 22.7 months if the initial birth ended in a death within&#13;
the first month ... 27.6 months if tnot, but within] the first year; 33.4&#13;
months" otherwise (Zachariah and Kurup, 1982, p. 18). Replacement may well be&#13;
more than oomplete, as a form of rational insurance to reaoh a given family&#13;
size norm, because "child losses are more frequent among women who experienoed&#13;
such a loss previously" (Ruzicka, 1982, p. 26). However, the importance of&#13;
the opposite, crowding, effect - habitually neglected in disoussions of&#13;
"over-insurance" against child deaths, via replaoement effects above unity -&#13;
is exemplified by Indian evidence from the early 19708 that, as the birth&#13;
interval from the previous child rose from "less than 1.5 years" to "more than&#13;
4.5", the IDR fell by over 75 percent (Ruzicka, 1982, p. 24).&#13;
To test the net outcome of the two effeots, 95 post-war populations&#13;
were sampled, to discover whether "the number of living offspring of women of&#13;
a specific age is roughly constant in a particular year, regardless of child&#13;
mortality". It proved impossible to rejeot the hypothesis that over a woman's&#13;
lifetime "cross-sectional variation in cumulative fertility is exaotly&#13;
compensating for variation in child mortality", i.e. that positive replaoement&#13;
effects and (normally) negative crowding effects were equal. A Brazilian&#13;
time-series has similar implioations. However, in several LDCJ, rural-urban&#13;
fertility gaps appear to imply overoorrection for child mortality gaps - i.e.&#13;
if the national replacement rate is unity, it is usually more in rural and&#13;
less in urban areas (Sohultz, 1981, pp. 137-40). That, in turn, seems almost&#13;
wholly traceable to higher levels of urban education, especially female (and&#13;
hence later marriage and lower couple fertility), rather than to higher rural&#13;
replacement fertility at given levels of eduoation (Birdeall, 1980, p. 52).&#13;
Indeed, micro-studies suggest a substantially greater "derivative of births&#13;
with respect to ohild deaths" for urban than for rural areas (Schultz, 1981,&#13;
pp. 141-3).&#13;
Do these links between fertility and mortality help explain why big&#13;
households now tend to be poor; and/or why poor groups tend to contain persons&#13;
who live in smaller households? It is tempting to argue that child&#13;
replaoement effect must be highest relative to crowding effeot for the&#13;
poorest, and least for the well-off, because family size and child/adult&#13;
ratios do inorease with poverty (since, as we see on pp. 33-8, family&#13;
structures and net emigration rates if anything offset this relationship; it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
has to be births and deaths that explain it). That tempting argument is&#13;
unsound. Replacement effect is only one of many determinants of birth-rates;&#13;
and crowding effect, of death-rates. Indeed, the "derivative of births with&#13;
respect to child deaths" appears to be higher for the better-off than for the&#13;
poor (and for Rio de Janeiro than for India); but it is not clear whether this&#13;
finding (reported in Schultz, 1981, pp. 141-3) nets out crowding effects, viz.&#13;
the derivative of child deaths with respect to births. If so, the finding is&#13;
surprising, because it would operate against the known positive link of&#13;
poverty to household size; but it would not be inconsistent with that link.&#13;
We know too little about (environmentally variable?) relationships of&#13;
poverty levels to (i) fertility, (ii) mortality - even if they are treated&#13;
separately as if there were no crowding and replacement effects - and a&#13;
fortiori (iii) the modifications due to (non-linear?) variation with&#13;
income-per-CU in exposure to crowding effect, and in propensities to insure&#13;
via replacement effect. Since undernutrition significantly increases&#13;
death-risk only if severe (Chen et al., 1981; Lipton, 1983), commonsense&#13;
suggests that crowding effect is greater in the poorest families than&#13;
elsewhere, and that - if the old-age-security motive is predominant, and the&#13;
net cost of extra children to the parents small - insurance via replacement&#13;
effect would also matter most to such families.&#13;
(g) Age of marriage and duration of unions&#13;
We are fairly certain that - holding education constant - poverty and&#13;
low status normally characterize people who marry later, cohabit for shorter&#13;
proportions of their marriage, and are fertile for shorter portions of the&#13;
periods of cohabitation; but that female education has similar effects,&#13;
although it normally goes with wealth and status. Inferences from these facts&#13;
to MHS are fraught with difficulties, however. Why?&#13;
For each variable that might be related to mean household size (MHS)&#13;
- e.g. for mortality, marital fertility, age and duration of marriage - we&#13;
have to ask three questions. What is the usual sign (+ or -) of the direct&#13;
relationship, assuming other variables that might affect MHS do not alter?&#13;
How does the importance of the direct relationship, given its usual sign, vary&#13;
among sets of households at different levels of poverty (e.g. MEP) and of&#13;
status (e.g. landholding, job, caste)? Are there indirect relationships, e.g.&#13;
via the effect of mortality upon fertility, and if so how do these differ&#13;
among the household sets?&#13;
In the case of the two variables so far considered, the third&#13;
question, that of indirect relationships, could be, if not ignored, reasonably&#13;
treated as subsidiary. (Thus replacement effect and sib crowding effect have&#13;
plainly offsetting effects on MHS). Therefore, the answer to the first&#13;
question, about sign of relationship, was fairly straightforward. So we could&#13;
concentrate on the second question, differential levels of the variable, and&#13;
hence directly of MHS, among poverty- and status-groups.   For example, marital&#13;
fertility obviously raises MHS; within the normal range of variation, it is&#13;
not greatly altered by other demographic variables; so we could concentrate on&#13;
the inter-group differences in the variable's effeot on MHS.&#13;
Duration of cohabitation - which is overwhelmingly dependent on age&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
of marriage - does not permit this simplified reduction of three questions to&#13;
the second only. It interacts with two variables, household struoture and&#13;
overall (though not greatly age-specific marital) fertility, and therefore has&#13;
major indirect relationships with household size, raising the third question,&#13;
and making the second (direct relationships, and the differences in their&#13;
effect on MHS as between groups of households) hard to sort out. Indeed, by&#13;
concentrating on one or other indirect effect, some analysts have appeared to&#13;
turn the answer to even the first question - the sign of the relationship&#13;
between marriage-age and MHS - into a near-tautology.&#13;
Unfortunately, the "tautology", for different experts, asserts&#13;
relationships of opposite signl Some argue that later marriage, via longer&#13;
retention of unmarried children in the average household, must increase MHS:&#13;
"AssumEing] that (i) all household heads (HH) are men; (ii) every man becomes&#13;
a HH if he survives long enough; and (iii) once a man is a HH he remains an&#13;
HH, [then, because MHS equals total population divided by number of heads of&#13;
household, we can assert that:] if men become HHs later in life, there will,&#13;
at any one time, be fewer household heads [and] thus fewer households and MHS&#13;
will be greater" (HaJnal, 1982, p. 463-4).&#13;
Others argue that later marriage, by decreasing average lifetime&#13;
fertility, must make households smaller: "If the age at marriage falls, [then&#13;
because over the fertile period the per-woman] birth-rate rises ... MHS will&#13;
[rise]" (Hayami and Uchida, 1972, p. 499).&#13;
Plainly, each of these conflicting propositions can be stated, on&#13;
distinct assumptions, as a tautology. If births-per-woman are unaffected by&#13;
age of marriage, and if - to take one set of household formation rules&#13;
consistent with Hajnal's three assumptions - all children leave the parental&#13;
home to set up new households if and only if they marry, then later marriage&#13;
must increase MHS. If children's period of residence with parents is&#13;
unaffected by their age of marriage, but births-per-person vary inversely with&#13;
it, then later marriage must reduce MHS. Unfortunately for simplicity, it is&#13;
fairly obvious that later marriage reduces births-per-woman (for a summary of&#13;
the strong effects in LDCs, see Birdsall, 1974, pp. 26-7, and 1980, pp. 49&#13;
(fn. 4), 57-8) and tends to prolong each partner's period of residence at a&#13;
parental home. The effects are further complicated by two factors. First,&#13;
multiple households (fn. 16) retain married sons or daughters for varying&#13;
periods, and are liable to become smaller - through death of the parent(s) -&#13;
as the children's marriage age is delayed. This is an important effect where&#13;
mortality is high; simulations suggest that, under one plausible set of&#13;
household formation rules, a rise in bride's age of marriage from 19 to 25&#13;
reduces the proportion of nuclear households from 62 percent to 54 percent&#13;
(Wachter and Hammell, 1978, p. 49). (This is especially suggestive in&#13;
explaining links of poverty to higher MHS, because nuclearity, tending on its&#13;
own to make later marriage increase family size where mortality is high, is -&#13;
like both mortality and delayed marriage - associated with poverty: see below,&#13;
pp. 27-32).&#13;
The second oomplication is that household splitting (whether multiple&#13;
households are common or rare) often happens for reasons other than marriage,&#13;
espeoially migration. Solitary male migration is a very oamon "life-cyole"&#13;
phenomenon, especially for the rural poor but not ultra-poor, (Seo. (i)). To&#13;
the extent that later marriage delays the oonversion of these one-person,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
mainly male, migrant households into married couples later, it reduoes MkS,&#13;
even assuming that the couple's lifetime fertility is unaffeoted. To the&#13;
extent that later marriage affects mainly oomplete families, where the&#13;
partners had, before their marriage, resided with their parents, the "Hajnal&#13;
effeot" predominates, and MRS inoreases.&#13;
It is my strong hunch - presented as such, in this Working Paper, for&#13;
oritical review - that in the fairly long term HaJnal effect is overwhelmed by&#13;
the effeot of early marriage in ramiing femle lifetime fertility; so that&#13;
early marriage indeed goes with lar8er family size. This hunoh arises because&#13;
there are so many ways to escape the assumptions required for the Hajnal&#13;
effect. Children can split from the parental household before marriage, e.g.&#13;
by migration; and they need not split from it after marriage. The number of&#13;
CUs that can be supported by a household's main occupations - and possibly the&#13;
size of the house, to judge by evidenoe from both Nigeria and Karnataka&#13;
(Caldwell, 1982, pers. comm.) - substantially affeots, for the poor perhaps&#13;
largely determines, the number of adults it supports over and above the&#13;
parental couple. Later marriage would, therefore, by adding temporarily to&#13;
the size of the parental home, induce offsetting faotors, viz. a greater&#13;
propensity by the parents to encourage migration by unmarried children, and a&#13;
lesser propensity to retain the married couple in the parental home for any&#13;
signifioant period. It is, however, not nearly so easy to offset the increase&#13;
in size due to higher fertility and more small children, especially in a&#13;
nuclear family. So in what follows it is assumed, plausibly but of course&#13;
pending proper testing, that in the fairly long run klS-increasing effects&#13;
(via more births-per-woman) of early marriage in a group strongly outweigh&#13;
MHS-reducing offects (via briefer retention in the parental home of potential&#13;
new heads of mall households).&#13;
Historical, and to a lesser extent recent, work suggests that later&#13;
marriage accompanies bad harvests, recessions, and - given the level of&#13;
education - oross-seotional poverty (Cassen, 1978, pp. 22-30; Schultz, p. 13;&#13;
Laslett, 1971, p. 86, and 1972, p. 154; Birdsall, 1974, pp. 27-8).&#13;
Historioally, prolonged resident service was a major factor enlarging MHS in&#13;
richer, and reducing it in poorer, households (see below, See. (k)) - a factor&#13;
closely conneoted to delayed marriage by the poor (Hajnal, 1982, pp. 482-3).&#13;
Resident service is normally much less important in today's LDCs than&#13;
historically in the NDCs; this weakens one major factor associating poverty&#13;
with later marriage (and hence, we hypothesize, with smaller MkS). Moreover,&#13;
education is spreading; it is strongly linked (i) to higher income or MEP (and&#13;
less strongly, to higher status, job or asset position), and (ii) to delayed&#13;
marriage; both the links are strongest for female post-primary, but are not&#13;
confined to that form of education. For example, for a large sample of wives&#13;
in Kerala in 1980, the regression ooeffioient upon "years of schooling"&#13;
(holding desired family size and KAP oonstant) of "age at marriage" among&#13;
women aged over 25 was 0.69 (F e 5.5, sig. at 5%); "educational achievement is&#13;
the principal determinant of age at marriage Euhich] showed an inorease of 3.7&#13;
years over a 25-year period". Since "for a boy, his chance of receiving a&#13;
good dowry is much brighter ... when he completes his educations, and sinoe&#13;
this "chance" is anyway suah likelier to be important for persons of higher&#13;
income and status, the spread of post-primary edueation associates delayed&#13;
marriage (and hence, we hypothesize, lower kiHS) with better-off people -&#13;
reversing the historioal association - even where suoh education is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
overwhelmingly male; this oan be inferred from the strong association, in the&#13;
Kerala data, between higher oaste, higher MEP, and age of bride at marriage&#13;
even holding her schooling constant (Zacharaiah and Kurup, 1982, Tables 4-5&#13;
and pp. 20-22).&#13;
While age of marriage is the main channel through whioh duration of&#13;
cohabitation influenoes inter-household variations in MHS - the inoidenoe of&#13;
illegitimaoy, historically in NDCs (Laslett, 1971, p. 142) and currently, we&#13;
suspeot, in most Asian and Afrioan coounities being rather small, well below&#13;
5 peroent - also important are duration and interruption of marriage. In most&#13;
of Africa, migrant male mineworking - and in muoh of Latin Amerioa, migrant&#13;
female domestic service - often leaves single, widowed, divoroed or abandoned&#13;
women. These tend to be poor by assooiation with three thingst their status&#13;
and its socially ascribed disadvantages, their own or their husbands' type of&#13;
unskilled labor, and their households' high dependenoy ratio. In seotion&#13;
III(c) below, we show that much of the exoess poverty of female-headed&#13;
households - which are normally amaller than male-headed households - is&#13;
associated with their heads' greater propensity to be widowed, divoroed or&#13;
"abandoned", a factor obvioualy also responsible in part for the household's&#13;
amallness, both by definition and because the male's absenoe probably reduces&#13;
incentives to ohildren to prolong their own stay (e.g. inheritance). In a&#13;
Central Javanese village in 1972-3, among the poorest women aged 40-44,&#13;
one-quarter of potential reproductive time had been lost through marital&#13;
disruption, as against 9% for middle-income and 2% for better-off women (Hull&#13;
and Hull, 1976, p. 23, ftn.)&#13;
This curtailment of unions may be as important as the numerical&#13;
effect of an absent spouse in "linking" the relative smallness of&#13;
female-headed households to their relative poverty. In general, marital&#13;
fertility seems to outweigh duration of unions - at least as represented by&#13;
the main oomponent of the latter, age at marriage - as an influence on how&#13;
income-groups or status-groups differ in respeot of the number of ohildren&#13;
ever born to a oouple. In rural Karnataka in 1961, in households of "laborers&#13;
and temporary tenants" a 9.2% higher proportion of women aged 15-44 were&#13;
married than was the oase in the households of less-poor (top 70% by&#13;
land-holding) owner-oultivators and permanent tenants. However, per 1,000&#13;
ourrently-married women aged 15-44, the former group had 12.6% fewer births&#13;
(Mitra, 1978, p. 213). Income-specific evidenoe, within groups or otherwise,&#13;
for India is not availablet but education, literacy and urban residence - all&#13;
independently associated with later marriage (Cassen, 1978, p. 51) - are all&#13;
linked also to higher income, both as between job and status groups and within&#13;
them. But the link of mother's education and literacy to fertility deoline is&#13;
stronger than their link to age of marriage. Through both routes, the low&#13;
level of female eduoation among the poorest may alone go far to explain their&#13;
large families.&#13;
(h) Complex householdas: larger, but rare, espeoially for poor and low-status&#13;
Household complexity in most LICs probably takes two main forms:&#13;
lateral extension of several married siblings, and multiplicity of couples&#13;
from auccesaive generations (normally because one or more married children&#13;
stay in a parental household). Complexity normally increases a group's MHS.&#13;
Complexity is held by some to be bad for "development" and to be aasociated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
to share income with related couples who are less energetic. Others claim&#13;
that complexity is good for "development", because each couple provides&#13;
insurance to others in the same household, and thus encourages risk-taking&#13;
(presumably pooled reserves could permit other scale-economies also).&#13;
Our concern is not to adjudicate these disputes, but to ask whether&#13;
complexity can help in explaining the correlations of high MHS with household&#13;
poverty (now), household affluence (historically), and/or high status, job and&#13;
asset positions (now and historically). However, the disputes are relevant to&#13;
these questions, for three reasons. First, if complexity were clearly&#13;
"developmental" (or anti-developmental), then - assuming at least some of the&#13;
benefits to be internalized - that would create long-term links of complexity&#13;
to affluence (or poverty), at least in growing economies. Second, settlement&#13;
of the disputes would have major policy implications, for the sort of family&#13;
structure (and implicitly MHS) which investment and incentive policies should&#13;
seek to reward or penalize. Third, the disputants often each imply a&#13;
teleology, in which "development" would lead to major falls in complexity (and&#13;
probably MHS), especially in more-successful and less-poor household groups,&#13;
if complexity impeded development incentive - or to rises in complexity and&#13;
MHS, again especially among the non-poor, if complexity assisted development&#13;
via insurance.&#13;
Both the pro-complexity and the anti-complexity view are&#13;
unhistorical, and rather unempirical. Both are unhistorical, because they see&#13;
complexity or nuclearity as a given condition, tending simply to change the&#13;
pattern of growth, poverty and development - whereas most sociologists&#13;
increasingly emphasize how such societal norms are flexible, and adaptive to&#13;
economic circumstance, even if supported by quite elaborate structures of&#13;
norms or theologies (see, for instance, Rudolph and Rudolph, 1967). And&#13;
pro-complexity and anti-complexity are unempirical, because they look neither&#13;
at forms of activity - small farming, rural carpentry, urban hawking? - in&#13;
order to identify the sectors and places in which complexity (and other&#13;
determinants of higher MHS) increase or worsen the prospect of escape from&#13;
poverty, nor at the evidence about the levels and trends, in various&#13;
circumstances, of complexity itself.&#13;
Such historical evidence as we have suggests that multiple or&#13;
extended households in pre-industrial Europe, even Eastern Europe - except&#13;
Russia and Serbia - seldom accounted for more than 10-20 percent of homes and&#13;
15-25 percent of persons; that, cross-sectionally, such households were, and&#13;
are, especially rare among the poor; and that there is no systematic&#13;
relationship, in time-series, between complexity (in its various forms) and&#13;
the various indicators of household poverty-reduction or "development". The&#13;
process of "Sanskritization" (Srinivas, 1962) - of imitation by poor&#13;
households, as poverty recedes, of the styles of life common in higher-status&#13;
examplars - extends far beyond Hinduism or India, and may today push the&#13;
urbanising or self-enriching household towards complexity, at least as&#13;
strongly as the olear links between MHS and poverty push it the other way. In&#13;
any case, it is olear that the cross-seotion association of poverty and&#13;
nuelearity has not (in any low-income sooiety for which we have evidence) yet&#13;
been overborne by any time-series dissociation between them that might exist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Complex households are likely to be bigger than othera. In&#13;
Aidan-ka-Was, Rajasthan, in 1961-2 - a village of 47 households and 303&#13;
persons - all eleven households with nine or more members, oontaining 37% of&#13;
the village's population, were complex, as against 13 of the 24 households&#13;
with 5-8 members (49%), and only one of the twelve smaller households (14%)&#13;
(Choudhary, 1964, pp. 137-40).  In the early 1970s, "complex" MHS was 14.9&#13;
persons in Mali villages, and "nuclear" MHS was 5.1 (about half the households&#13;
being nuclear). Comparable figures in three Northern Nigerian areas, each for&#13;
three villages, were 7.1 and 4.9 in Sokoto (72% nuclear); 10.9 and 6.2 in&#13;
Zaria (51% nuclear); and 7.5% and 5.1% in Bauchi (64% nuolear) (Norman et al.,&#13;
1981, pp. 21-2). In two Bangladesh villages the gaps were smaller: 7.42&#13;
(5.86) in Bhatpara, 7.26 (5.99) in Bhabanipur (Khan et al., 1981, pp. 8, 10).&#13;
Does the larger average size of complex households mean that groups -&#13;
by location, status, MEP, eto. - with a bigger proportion of oomplex&#13;
households will usually show higher MHS? It need not follow, for familiar&#13;
reasons of "ecological fallacy"; for example, a community, initially&#13;
comprising entirely nuclear households, could - while maintaining the same&#13;
total number of households and persons - transfer members from some nuclear&#13;
households to other related nuclear households, making the latter complex (and&#13;
bigger in MHS than the former), but obviously without ohanging community MHS.&#13;
A cross-seotion version of such a situation, indeed, must underlie the claims&#13;
for England (1574-1821) that "mean household size in a oommunity does not&#13;
appear to be correlated at all highly with" the proportion of complex&#13;
households (Laslett, 1972, p. 126; a similar lack of relationship among Indian&#13;
groups is posited by Shah, 1968). Yet in reality, for 64 English communities&#13;
in 1574-1821, the simple r between MHS and complexity, averaging Laslett's two&#13;
indicators of the latter, is *.3412 (Laslett et al., 1978, pp. 70-73). The&#13;
three villages in each of three Nigerian areas (Norman et al., 1981, pp. 21-2)&#13;
show a close relationship between MHS and oomplexity, though N = 3 is too few&#13;
to oonclude muohl Anyway, the link of complexity to MHS is stronger aoross&#13;
groups than aoross places.&#13;
How strong is the inference from a group's high degree of oomplexity&#13;
to its high MHS? This must partly depend on the extent of endogamy within&#13;
that household group. Pressures within a caste, status-group, or asset-owning&#13;
group tend fairly strongly towards endogamy; much more weakly so, for an&#13;
income, MEP or occupational group; and for many localities, such as Indian&#13;
villages, the pressures are towards exogamy. The "more endogamous" a group,&#13;
the likelier it is that high MHS among its subgroup of complex households is&#13;
"purchased" at the cost of lower MHS among its (oomplement) subgroup of&#13;
nuclear, including sole, households; though if this "purchase" goes far enough&#13;
it eliminates some of the smaller nuclear households, e.g. by retaining&#13;
married offspring inside the parental home.&#13;
In general, however, for both households and (less certainly)&#13;
household groups, greater complexity acoompanies greater size. Before we show&#13;
that complexity also goes with lesser poverty and higher status - in&#13;
cross-sections, but not clearly in time-series - we need to examine whether&#13;
complexity is at all *important". The incidenoes cited from Africa and India&#13;
on p. 29 suggest that significant proportions of households - and even more,&#13;
given the larger typioal size of complex households, of persons - are affected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
by oomplexity at any moment of sampling; and since the couples heading many&#13;
nuclear households, at any such moment, have previously been embedded in an&#13;
in-law's home (and have then turned two nuclear households into one complex&#13;
household), a substantially larger proportion of households has had some&#13;
experience of complexity during its family cycle. However, there is some&#13;
reason to believe (A. Shah, 1968) that our scanty Indian village data somewhat&#13;
overestimate the average rural incidence of complex households. Epstein&#13;
obtained 8-10% for two Karnataka villages in 1953, which "conforms to the&#13;
all-India picture" (A. Shah, 1973, p. 199), but a rather higher proportion,&#13;
say 15% nationally, may be applicable: of. the 20-29% estimated from a small&#13;
sample of studies by Kolenda (1968, P. 390) and the 32% in Shah's Gujarat&#13;
village (ibid., p. 27).&#13;
Certainly, in the history of most NDCs, Laslett's teams have&#13;
demonstrated that complexity is far less important than was once believed. Of&#13;
64 relatively well-documented English settlements (sampled data range from&#13;
1574 to 1821), about 8.6% of households were "solitary"; 3.2% "no family",&#13;
including a few unmarried or widowed siblings; 71.2% nuclear; 11.9% extended;&#13;
3.7% multiple; and about 1% indeterminate (Laslett et al., 1978, p. 74). One&#13;
in six households, and perhaps one in four or five persons, lived in complex&#13;
households. Other pre-industrial NDCs, except in Serbia and parts of Russia,&#13;
appear to show a similarly small incidence of complexity, very seldom reaching&#13;
25% of households (Duptquier and Jadin, 1972, pp. 290-1, for Corsica; van der&#13;
Woude, 1972, pp. 306-7, for the Netherlands; Andorka and Farago', 1983, pp.&#13;
288, 293, for Hungary; Schmidtbauer, 1983, pp. 364-6, for Austria; Danhieux,&#13;
1983, p. 414, for Flanders). Simulations of the effect of quite large changes&#13;
in mortality (Vachter and Hamell, 1978, esp. p. 48) show that this low&#13;
complexity cannot be attributed, to any significant degree, to high&#13;
death-rates among families "wanting" to remain complex - e.g. by a high risk&#13;
that heads of multiple households, who are mostly fathers sharing a house with&#13;
their married children living at home, would anyway be old enough to die soon.&#13;
A low incidence of complex households is due mainly, not to demographic&#13;
variables (though marriage-age is of some importance), but to a preference for&#13;
nuolearity.&#13;
There is, however, evidence associating such preference with high&#13;
status, asset, and job positions; for India, perhaps surprisingly but quite&#13;
clearly and understandably, 22/ with absenoe of industrialization and&#13;
urbanization; and to a lesser extent with poverty (lower MEP).&#13;
Shah demonstrated the linkage of high caste status to complexity,&#13;
both for his Gujarati village in both 1955 and in 1821 (A. Shah, 1973, pp.&#13;
93-101; see also Kolenda, 1968). He also indicates that complexity is linked&#13;
with urbanization, and perhaps industrialization also (see especially Lambert,&#13;
1963, for Poona), from a wide range of almost unanimous quantitative studies,&#13;
for post-Independence India as a whole (ibid., pp. 148-51).&#13;
Other historical and recent data confirm this. In England from 1570&#13;
to 1820, great houses were much likelier than the poor to have complex&#13;
households (Laslett, 1971, pp. 95, 181; 1978, pp. 93-4) Data for Romans, S.&#13;
France, in 1586 confirm this (Ladurie, 1979, p. 4). In Florence in 1427, 22.7&#13;
percent of the 427 richest households contained two or more nuclear family&#13;
units, as against 6-9 percent of 9374 other households (Klapiseh, 1972, pp.&#13;
277, 279). The data in the 1983 papers reported above (p. 30) provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
unanimous support for the link between complexity, status and affluenoe from&#13;
pre-industrial NDCa. Similarly, a review of post-war African and Asian data&#13;
concludes that "households ... consisting of kin and non-kin generally oour&#13;
among rioher individuals" (Goody, 1972, p. 122). In kidan-ka-Was, Rajasthang&#13;
in 1961-2, the scheduled castes (the likeliest "poor group") were mainly&#13;
nuoleated; but 19 out of 32 intermediate (mainly farming) oastes were joint&#13;
(Choudhary, 1964, pp. 137-40). In Patadia villaget Gujarat, in 1963, the 71&#13;
scheduled-tribe families (plus the non-Hindu family) were split 50-50 between&#13;
oomplex and nuclear; but ten of the twelve non-soheduled Hindu families were&#13;
oomplex (Shetty, 1963, p. 40). In urban Malaysia, poorer households also&#13;
tended to be simpler (Mazumdar, 1981, pp. 4-5). In rural Bangladesh, 665 of&#13;
nuolear (but "only" 47% of extended) families in Bhatpara village oultivated&#13;
below one acre; the respective proportions were 81% (75%) in Shabanipur&#13;
village (Khan et al., 1981, p. 8). 23/&#13;
What are the mechanisms? First, extendedness - where feasible - may&#13;
well decrease risk of poverty given family size. For example, in three N.&#13;
Nigerian villages in 1974-59 all six large nuclear households (over 9&#13;
residents) were among the poorest 30% of all households by inoome-per-CU, as&#13;
against 7 of the 19 large - and 1 of the 5 largest - extended households&#13;
(Matlon, 1979). This may be linked with eoonomies of scale in oonsumption&#13;
(Sec. IV (d)).&#13;
Second, poverty aocompanies nuolearity partly because both go with&#13;
low workforoe/dependent ratios. In a 1975 urban sample in Malaysia, "Joint&#13;
households help families esoape from poverty, beoause (they] add more to&#13;
earning strength than to dependenoy" (Mazumdar, 1981, p. 359). In nine N.&#13;
Nigerian villages, extended families averaged about 25% fewer dependents per&#13;
male adult than nuolear families (Norman et al., 1981, p. 22). This could&#13;
mean that (i) extended families are less prone to ohild mortality, or less&#13;
fertile, than nuolear families; or that (ii) extended families are easier to&#13;
form and keep together when the various nuclear couples have few small&#13;
children. If (i) occurs, it is an effect (rather than a oause) of a low&#13;
incidenoe of poverty; extended families, because less likely to suffer from&#13;
very low income-per-CU, would indeed be expected to show lower ohild mortality&#13;
than nuclear families. As for (ii), the evidence does not show any systematic&#13;
relationship - given the level of income per person or per CU - between&#13;
nuolearity, or extendednesst and low (or high) fertility (Nugent and Walther,&#13;
1981, p. 14; Mitra, 1978, pp. 224-5).&#13;
Third, the complex household oan be a sign of status, to which people&#13;
aspire as their status increases. This is associated with "Sanskritization"&#13;
in India, and helps to account not only for the close relationships of&#13;
complexity to higher oastes, but also for its persistence, even inarease -&#13;
though not from a high base level - with growth, industrializationt and&#13;
urbanization (A. Shah, 1973).&#13;
Finally, there are the three major "eoonomic" explanations of&#13;
"multiple downward extension" (Laslett and Wall, 1972, pp. 30-31) - married&#13;
ohildren living in a household of whioh one of their parents is the head -&#13;
which, even if itself short-lived, ia probably the starting-point of most&#13;
household complexity. Two of these explanations explicitly suggest that&#13;
partioular groups of not-very-poor people would be likeliest to be involved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
One theory suggests that extended families are most comon where the&#13;
experience of the elderly is rendered valuable by environmental uncertainty or&#13;
fluctuation. Aoross Indian districts, high farm profit variability is&#13;
significantly linked to the incidence of extended families. Farming families,&#13;
especially in risky areas, would then be more prone to "extendedness" than&#13;
(normally poorer) labor households, and so it turns out (Rosenzweig and&#13;
Wolpin, 1979, p. 4 and Table 4).&#13;
Another explanation of why better-off people are less unlikely to&#13;
have complex households is wealth transfer - the "will-shaking" theory of&#13;
household complexity (Butler, 1903). Less-poor fathers can keep their working&#13;
children on the family farm (or in the firm) by the lure of inheritance; the&#13;
poorest, in particular, have little to pass on. "Poor men's gandaye [extended&#13;
family farm systems in Northern Nigeria] effectively collapse because their&#13;
sons migrate, concentrate on outside work, or fail to obey them" (P. Hill,&#13;
1972, p. 147). Inheritance rules, written or implicit, in many communities&#13;
stipulate "that children live with and care for their parents", and types of&#13;
joint household have been empirically linked to types of inheritance system&#13;
that promise advantage to the younger members (Nugent and Walther, 1981, p.&#13;
18).&#13;
These two explanations - experience and will-shaking - address the&#13;
question of why a son or daughter might prefer not to nuoleate upon marriage;&#13;
both favor non-nucleation much more in households with heritable assets. (So&#13;
does the obvious fact that a multi-couple household is more tolerable if it&#13;
can afford to allot each couple a separate bedroom.) The other common&#13;
explanation, search for security in old age, addresses the question of why the&#13;
parents might seek a non-nuclear solution. Since absolute risk aversion&#13;
increases as income-per-CU falls, and since the poorest have fewest prospects&#13;
of a secure old age unless supported by their family, parental demand for&#13;
extendedness is presumably highest among the poorest; yet we know that&#13;
extendedness is least prevalent there. Therefore, the correlation, with&#13;
poverty, of parents' "demand" for extendedness must be outweighed by the&#13;
correlation, with affluence, of married children's "supply" (given the&#13;
"income-elasticities" of the two functions).&#13;
Extended families tend to be bigger and better-off than nuclear&#13;
families. They therefore could help to explain why higher-status groups tend&#13;
to have larger families. The evidence from Patadia and Aidan-ka-Was, locating&#13;
high propensities to extendedness as a characteristic of such groups (rather&#13;
than of individuals), supports this; so does Shah's evidence, and so do the&#13;
frequent links between social group membership, type and scale of asset&#13;
holding, inheritance system, relevance of experience of elders, and family&#13;
type. But why do the poor in total populations have bigger families? Here,&#13;
extendedness seems to point the wrong way, for it is less frequent among the&#13;
poor. If extendedness is a norm for groups - the high-caste, the landed, etc.&#13;
- and is only weakly linked to poverty if status is held constant, that "wrong&#13;
pointer" is removed, but the data do not cast any light on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
(1) Migration: the relationship to differenoes in MRS&#13;
If an individual is likelier to migrate from poorer - or lower-status&#13;
- households than other households (even without thereby changing them from&#13;
oomplex to nuolear in form), then suoh emigration would tend to make these&#13;
households of origin smaller than others. Sinoe individual migration in MICs&#13;
is ooncentrated among single young persons, their households of destination&#13;
would also tend to initially (and for the first few years afterwards, perhaps)&#13;
to show both relative-status and HEP oharaoteristics similar to those of the&#13;
households of origin. Thus migration - at least of some important types -&#13;
tends to reduce MRS in the status and MEP groups that are more affeoted by it,&#13;
or among which it is becoming more important relative to other groups.&#13;
Before looking at the evidence, and the impaot on poverty-status-MRS&#13;
relationships, we should stress that they are almost unaffected by the three&#13;
main sorts of migration - all largely intra-rural - in LICs   Marriage&#13;
migration (usually for a few miles only, to meet the requirements of village&#13;
exogamy) remains much the likeliest explanation of any observation that a&#13;
person in India (Bose, 1967), and probably in most other LICs, lives away from&#13;
his or her birthplace; although one can build models where marriage migration&#13;
is associated with systematic differenoes in MRS by poverty or status, such&#13;
models are not plausible. Total household migration appears to be less&#13;
important, as a share of long-term migration, among the better-off than among&#13;
the poor (Connell et al., 1976, pp. 12-13), but it, too, would not seem to&#13;
alter the migrant households' MRS. Temporary migration for a few weeks,&#13;
usually to seasonal farmwork, is similarly "poor-selective" (lbid., pp. 79-80,&#13;
122-3) but by definition leaves inter-group variations in "normal" MHS&#13;
unaffected - though it could help explain low MRS among laborers in&#13;
peak-aeason surveysi&#13;
Therefore, in asking whether migration affects MRS differently among&#13;
poor and others, or among low-status and others, we are enquiring mainly into&#13;
long-run, individual (as against household), non-marriage, and mainly&#13;
rural-to-urban migration - hereafter "LINIM".  Prior to this enquiry, three&#13;
faots should be stressed. First, the proportions of LIC - as opposed to MIC -&#13;
populations who undertake LINUM, and hence the rate of urbanization and the&#13;
urban shares in most LICs, are quite small (Lipton, 1982). For example, in&#13;
1961 only one Indian in 33 was for any reason a rural-born town-dweller (Bose,&#13;
1967), so these persons are unlikely to account for muoh of the very strong&#13;
size-poverty or size-status links.&#13;
Second, LICs show a quite new link between LINUM and&#13;
poverty-status-MRS relationships. In most pre- and early-industrial NDCo -&#13;
and even now In Latin Amerioa - LINUX tended to produce female-headed, and&#13;
henoe (p. 13) relatively small, urban households. In today's LICs in Asia and&#13;
Afrioa, LINUM is predominantly young and male (Connell et al., 1976, p. 39).&#13;
Since migrating male-headed households tend to be larger, and for other&#13;
reasons also, such migration does not appear to counter the tendenoy for urban&#13;
households, especially among poorer persons (Table 2), to be at least as big&#13;
as rural households in LICs. 24/&#13;
Third, the effects on the poverty-status-MRS links from LINUM are not&#13;
only small and historically novel, but also very oomplex and hard to isolate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
from other ractors. Thus (i) an MEP-declle or status group, exposed to an&#13;
unusually high rate of suoh migration, would show below-average MHS in&#13;
originating households, if other things were equal. However, they are&#13;
unequal, because multi-sibling households and persons of higher birth-order&#13;
are more prone to emigration (Connell et al., 1976, p. 46). LINUM therefore&#13;
tends to be higher from households with high MHS (Harbison, 1982, p. 232).&#13;
Indeed, this even shows up as somewhat above-average MHS, even after LINUM, in&#13;
the originating households (Lucas, 1982, p. 19, for Botswana). As for the&#13;
effect of an above-average LINUM upon a group's MRS in destination households,&#13;
it is presumably positive if migrants join kin, negative if they set up new&#13;
one-person homes. Moreover (ii) LINUM selects the fairly-poor and&#13;
fairly-affluent - principally young men from the second-highest and&#13;
aecond-lowest quintiles of households by MEP - from unequal villages.&#13;
Further, (iii) these migrants tend, respectively, to be students (or persons&#13;
following relatives in a "ohain" to assured jobs), and work-seeking "step"&#13;
migrants (Connell et al., 1976, pp. 198-200) - so even LINUM is not uniform in&#13;
type. Finally, (iv) suocessful LINUM migrants - and they are many, since&#13;
LINUM selects risk-takers, the better-educated, and people with better&#13;
information - move up both MEP and status scales, while unsuccessful ones&#13;
often return (daVanzo, 1982, pp. 115-7); both groups change MRS in the&#13;
process.&#13;
As far as urban households are concerned, recent ones, formed by&#13;
immigrants or otherwise, tend to have lower MRS. Are they also poorer? It&#13;
appears to have become almost a new conventional wisdom that the urban poor,&#13;
recent immigrants, underemployed, and informal workers are practically&#13;
non-overlapping groups. At least, it seems to be suggested, membership of any&#13;
one group renders membership of any other less likely (Bromley, ed., 1978;&#13;
Lloyd, 1979; Mohan and Hartline, 1980). If this were so, then the normally&#13;
smaller families of recent migrants would be linked to lower risk of poverty.&#13;
However, the evidence for the new view is primarily Latin American,&#13;
and even there it is thin. In Africa and South Asia - in the LICs especially&#13;
- detailed survey work confirms that recent urban immigrants are likelier than&#13;
other urban persons to be young men with no, or small, households; to be&#13;
unemployed, informal, or casual in workforce status; and to have low&#13;
income-per-CU (Papanek, 1975; Sabot, 1977; Lipton, 1983a, Sec. III. d.4). At&#13;
the urban end, in countries with substantial poverty, destination households&#13;
for LINUX therefore tend to "link" poverty and low status - relative to&#13;
setttled urban households - with lower MRS. (Clearly this is overwhelmed by&#13;
other, non-migration linkers, for urban MHS is strongly and positively linked&#13;
to poverty: see Table 2).&#13;
At the rural end, we have crudely characterized above the households&#13;
most liable to LINUX. The poor, rather than the poorest, are pushed out into&#13;
a wandering, probably increasingly rural, quest for work; the modestly&#13;
better-off, rather than those tied to substantial rural assets, are able to&#13;
support temporary eosts of their sons' "pull" migration towards urban schools&#13;
and Jobs. What is the impact on rural households' size-poverty nexus from&#13;
such migration patterns?&#13;
For Rajasthan and Gujarat, medium-term migration of individuals from&#13;
households is signifioantly contributing to reduced MRS in some villages. For&#13;
11 villages, average household size and the proportion of out-migrants to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
population of reporting households are inversely related (r = -.6154,&#13;
significant at 5%); the same relationship holds for student and working&#13;
migrants separately (Connell et al., 1976, p. 193; household size from Tables&#13;
1-3 of this chapter). 25/  Thus - although at household level it is the bigger&#13;
households, with more siblings, which tend to become smaller via emigration -&#13;
villages with substantial emigration, at least in this Indian data set,&#13;
average lower MHS.&#13;
Which rural households can get smailer, and so perhaps escape&#13;
poverty, by this process? Agricultural laborers, at least in North and East&#13;
India, appear to migrate (i) as total households rather than as indivlduals,&#13;
and/or (ii) for temporary rural, rather than medium-term urban, settlement.&#13;
It is in the intermediate castes - including the main "dominant" farming&#13;
castes - that fairly high emigration rates reflect the chances for better-off&#13;
households to reduce size and increase income (ibid., pp. 187-8).&#13;
In rural areas, therefore, migration helps to link poverty to large&#13;
MHS w'.thin the intermediate castes, and therefore within total populations.&#13;
Small MRS among laborers, as an occupation or as a caste-linked group, is not&#13;
as such associated with total migration; but laborers' relatively greater&#13;
poverty (and hence shortage of information, education, and risk-taking&#13;
capacity) is associated with types of migration - seasonal, step, or&#13;
total-household - offering relatively unpromising prospects. Thus, as between&#13;
rural groups, emigration does not help to link smallness (among labor&#13;
househ-olds) to poverty, because it is the less-pocr non-laboring castes that&#13;
are likelier to reduce MHS via emigration.&#13;
Thus, in towns, migration helps explain the link of low-status groups&#13;
to low MHS, but makes it harder to explain the link of poverty to high MHS.&#13;
In rural areas, the opposite applies. But in either case, since only LINUM&#13;
has obviously major effects upon MHS and is itself rather small (p. 33), the&#13;
contribution of migration to poverty-status-MHS links is smallish also.&#13;
Finally, individual migration (tending to decrease MHS) and joint or&#13;
extended families (tending to reduce it) orten go together. Hence, among any&#13;
particular set of households, they offset each other's impact on family size&#13;
as a cause of poverty. Extended and joint families provide structures&#13;
favorable to - and empirically are oorrelated with (Connell et al., 1976,&#13;
p. 48) - the trying-out, comunioating, initially tisk-bearing and -sharing,&#13;
ultimately portfolio-diversifying process of chain migration (Stark, 1975).&#13;
Conversely, in Northern Nigeria, nucleation, male gandu, and female purdah&#13;
combine to prevent any but short-term, seasonal migration (Connell et al.,&#13;
1976, p. 48).&#13;
(j) Family cycles and MHS&#13;
The history of most couples and their offspring - from marriage,&#13;
through the period when there are small non-earning children, to the time when&#13;
children increasingly augment family income, and ultimately to the departure&#13;
of the children from one or both surviving parents - may link poverty or&#13;
status to MRS in two ways. First, family history may affect poverty (or&#13;
status) and MHS together; for eam-ple, it is often claimed that the completed&#13;
but young family and the single-member, especially widow, family are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
partioularly likely to be poor. Second, the different household formation&#13;
patterns of groups, in a society, with distinot status or affluenoe - for&#13;
example through later marriage, or greater household complexity, among the&#13;
better-o"f - may give such groups distinct family histories, and hence HHSs.&#13;
Both effects vary among societies and over time, and can be drastically&#13;
altered by "the requirements of domestic production" (Sieder and Mitterauer,&#13;
1983, pp. 339-45) or by an unbalanced sex-ratio (Wall, 1983, p. 473).&#13;
Ideally a long-term panel survey is needed to investigate these two&#13;
effects. Lacking this, we can examine age of household head, child/adult&#13;
ratios, and reported marriage age in various group, though we then risk&#13;
misreading genuine societal change as "merely" a difference between older and&#13;
younger household heads, etc. The overall discussion of family cycles, as&#13;
they interact with poverty and status, is left to Sec. III(d), but two&#13;
conclusions from that discussion are relevant to our topic here - the effect&#13;
of the family cyole on poverty-status-MHS links. First, the cycle seems to&#13;
have muoh less relationship to poverty in most of today's LICs than in&#13;
pre-industrial history in most NDCs (p. 54; of. HaJnal, 1982). Second, in&#13;
several Indian villages, poverty is attributable to the family-cycle to the&#13;
extent that jobs and land are not automatioally ascribed to persons born into&#13;
a particular lifelong status-group, viz. a caste (pp. 54-5).&#13;
The first finding reduces somewhat the likely power of family-cycles&#13;
- unless they are very different among groups in an LDC community - to explain&#13;
poverty-status-MlS relationships there. The second finding, however, could&#13;
help explain why groups rigidly "condemned' to low status and poor earnings&#13;
prospects keep small MHSs. Parents in suoh groups see little prospect that&#13;
maturing children can overcome the barriers against training for, or entry to,&#13;
lucrative trades or professions. They may thus see little gain from having&#13;
many children.&#13;
The "old" end of the life-cycle in LICs is clearer: it has very&#13;
little to do with poverty-status-MHS links. Contrary to the experienoe of&#13;
rich countries today - and with one major exoeption, that of widows in some&#13;
Islamic societies - the old, unsupported, single-person household of low&#13;
status is not a major source even of relative poverty, though micro-level&#13;
evidence seems to be limited. In two village surveys, from the 1960s, in each&#13;
of two Indian States (Rajasthan and Gujarat), single-member status is quite a&#13;
good proxy for "widowed or deserted" and "old and alone" phases of some&#13;
life-cycles. Some 7.7% of the 983 households in these four villages are&#13;
single-membered, but these contain only 1.5% of the 5,200 persons. Among&#13;
scheduled castes and tribes, 9.2% of the 130 households, with 1.9% of the 621&#13;
persons, are single-membered (R. Patel, 1964, p. 71; and 1964a, p. 421; M.&#13;
Desai, 1966, p. 37; anon., 1971, p. 30). These differences (non-significant&#13;
at 5%) are less than one would expeot from the smaller average size of&#13;
scheduled-easte households. These phases in the family oycle, at least in&#13;
these villages, contribute very little to the extreme poverty of the soheduled&#13;
castes and tribes. In Kerala (Caldwell et al., 1982, pp. 28) this may be&#13;
because isolated widowhood is so parlous for the poor that they go to great&#13;
lengths to avoid it.&#13;
As for occupation-linked poverty, only one village survey each in&#13;
Rajasthan and Gujarat shows single-member families by main income source.&#13;
While 11.0% of all 372 households (and 2.1% of 1,939 persons) in the two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
villages had single-member status, laborers actually featured lower inoidences&#13;
- 5.5% of 110 labor households, 1.1% of 541 persons (Patel, 1964a, p. 43;&#13;
anon., 1971, p. 31). These are only a few villages; but it does not look as&#13;
if the family-cycle phase that creates single-member households, in rural&#13;
India at least, is a major reason why either laborers or low-status social&#13;
groups are very poor despite small household size. The reasons for believing&#13;
that this is more generally true are the negative empirical link in several&#13;
LICs between age and risk of poverty (See. III(b)); and the need for old&#13;
single non-workers, where there is no sooial security, to subsist from savings&#13;
or family support, in either case breaking the link with relative poverty that&#13;
is assumed in Western societies. The absence of a clear, stable or consistent&#13;
link between poverty-risk and age of household head, both among laboring and&#13;
among cultivating households, is confirmed by Gaiha's rural Indian sample for&#13;
1968-70 (Gaiha, 1973, Tables 18, 19).&#13;
However, some evidence that the prime-age phases of the family oycle&#13;
contribute to both the within-group and the total-population relationships of&#13;
poverty to MHS is considered in Seo. III(d). In a sense, indeed, the argument&#13;
that - since most families in most groups are nuclear - the phases when a&#13;
household contains many small children "pulls together" poverty and high MHS&#13;
does not require elaborate empirical support.&#13;
We can also be confident that family cycles mean that point surveys&#13;
overestimate (i) disutility due to poverty, and (1i) association of poverty&#13;
with inequality. Both are weakened to the extent that the members of the&#13;
"poorest decile" - for example - of households by income-per-CU at survey time&#13;
are not always in that decile. Good and bad luck alone make this likely;&#13;
systematic family cycle variations strengthen the likelihood.&#13;
However, great caution is needed in attributing poverty or affluence,&#13;
or big or small households, to "the" family cycle. It varies across cultures&#13;
- though the small nuclear family norm, especially for poorer households, is&#13;
widespread - and within societies. Also, as the evidence on age of marriage&#13;
(pp. 25-6) shows, family cycles can be much altered, even in a given group, by&#13;
economic incentive and stress. The direction of family-eycle effects on&#13;
poverty and MHS in mid-life is fairly clear, but their size may be small, as&#13;
we shall see on p. 54.&#13;
(k) Non-family members, MRS and poverty&#13;
In NDC pre-industrial history, recent researoh shows that an&#13;
astonishingly large proportion of persons appears to have been resident as&#13;
servants. This residence substantially, but not totally, aocounted for the&#13;
positive MEP-MRS relationship then prevailing; the much smaller role of such&#13;
resident servants in today's LICs partly explains the negative relationship&#13;
found there today. Furthermore (Hajnal, 1982) the frequenoy of service by&#13;
young unmarried persons in much of pre-industrial Europe was associated with&#13;
later marriage among the poor; because the poor enter much more rarely into&#13;
such service in today's LICs than in NDC pre-industrial history (while the&#13;
well-off more ceomonly enter into higher education), it is now the better-off&#13;
who tend to marry later (pp. 24-7). So the whole question of family size -&#13;
and family cycles - as it affects status and poverty, is tied up with the&#13;
pattern of non-family membership of households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
Among the hundred English ounuities in 1574-1821 with the most&#13;
reliable data, servants oomprised 13.4% of persons - presumably 20-25% of&#13;
workers; and 28.5% of households had servants (Laslett, 1972, p. 152). In&#13;
1748-9, In two Dutoh provinoes, the proportions were 14% and 12% (van der&#13;
Woude, 1972, p. 308). Evidenoe of large numbers of servants in pre-industrial&#13;
NDCa has been oompiled for plaoes with mostly nuclear families (HaJnal, 1982,&#13;
pp. 456-7, 470-4), but even in Belgrade in 1733-4, where oomplex households&#13;
were quite ooon, 10.3% of persons were resident servants (Laslett and&#13;
Clarke, 1972, p. 379). Servant proportions seem to have fallen sharply with&#13;
or before early industrialization, and as between country and town (Wall,&#13;
1983, p. 497; Hayami and Uohida, 1972, p. 504).&#13;
Data from today's LICs very seldom show anything approaohing this&#13;
inoidence of resident servants. In the Census of 1951, all unrelated persons&#13;
formed only 1.2 percent of India's population; in rural China in 1929-31 the&#13;
proportion was even smaller (Hajnal, 1982). Resident servants appear&#13;
similarly rare in the intensive mioro-studies that I have surveyed, espeoially&#13;
from India and Northern Nigeria. (This rarity is most unlikely to be due to&#13;
any great extent to the alleged concealment of bonded labor from enquirers&#13;
(P. Hill, 1982)). Several reasons seem plausible. The higher person/land&#13;
ratios of today's LICs make it more costly to acoommodate a servant (relative&#13;
to hiring a laborer) than was the oase in pre-industrial NICs. Today, too,&#13;
the better-off have more access to labor-saving domestio devioes. Alao,&#13;
higher rates of child survival may now help more of the better-off to meet&#13;
family labor needs without servants; in a village in West Flanders in 1814&#13;
(Danhieux, 1983, p. 418), and in an Austrian village even holding the&#13;
employer's eoonomic status roughly oonstant (S9hmidtbauer, 1983, p. 355), more&#13;
servants normally went with fewer children aged over ten or so. 26/&#13;
Servant status itself, too, was sharply life-oyclioal in most&#13;
pre-industrial NDCs: for instance, in seventeenth-oentury Austria, 35% of all&#13;
servants of known age were under 19, and 46% were aged 20-29 (Schmidtbauer,&#13;
1983, p. 358). The great majority of resident servants were of one sex -&#13;
sometimes female, e.g. if servant work overlapped with textile artisanship as&#13;
in Brugea, Belgium, in 1814 (Wall, 1983, p. 461), perhaps more usually male;&#13;
and servant families in residence appear to have been unusual (Sohmidtbauer,&#13;
1983, pp. 359, 362). Therefore, servant status historioally delayed marriage&#13;
for the poor. Sooietioe where 10-15 peroent or more of persons were resident&#13;
servants, therefore, reduced MRS among the poor in two ways. First,&#13;
adoloscent sons went into service and transferred residence to richer&#13;
households. Sooond, they thereby delayed marriage and reduced oompleted&#13;
family size. Demonstrably, this was a major reason why in NDC pre-industrial&#13;
history poor households were amaller than others; and aimilarly, the deoline&#13;
of resident service - acoompanied by education that selectively defers&#13;
leas-ooor ohildron's marriages (pp. 26-7) - pays a big part in the reversal in&#13;
today's LICs of the traditional NDC link between poverty and small MKS.&#13;
To a man extent, migration in today's LICs may have replaced&#13;
service as a write of passage3, enabling big poor households to shed, for a&#13;
while, unmarried sons. But migration is far less powerful than service in&#13;
reduoing poor households' MRS relative to other househods. First, ohildren&#13;
from om     rich households migrate too. Seoond, while migration is like "going&#13;
lnto servioew in reducing the size of the poor household of origin, only the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
latter also inoreases MS4 in the (wealthier) destination households. The&#13;
power of this second, double, effect, oan be interred from a single village in&#13;
Kent, England, in April 1676 (Laslett, 1971, p. 66). Of the 178 persons in&#13;
the 29 homes of "gentry and yeomen", 49 were servants. Not one servant lived&#13;
among the 53 persons (24 hoseholds) of "laborers and poor men". Probably,&#13;
these households were so small in part because many of their ohildren were in&#13;
servioe with better-off households.&#13;
(1) Poverty, status and family size: some Dointers&#13;
Poor households, more than others, need the "degreea of freedom"&#13;
supplied by ability to make overt, explicit choices, with predictable&#13;
outcomes, in regard to variables influencing MHS and household composition.&#13;
Yet poor households are less likely to Let such freedom. For example, fewer&#13;
poor households are oomplex. Complex households oan provide insuranoe to&#13;
eaoh couple (support by the others in sickness or other mishap),&#13;
soale-eoonomies in consumption, and reserve labor (espeoially if such&#13;
households feature relatively low fertility or child/adult ratios: Laslett,&#13;
1972, p. 56; Andorka and Farago", 1983, p. 306); or oan split into simple&#13;
households when these advantages of complexity are outweighed by drawbaoks.&#13;
Voluntary and "pull-induced" migration; controlled spacing of births; choices&#13;
of the age of marriage or of the time when post-primary education (or of&#13;
service or apprenticeship) takes an adolesoent or young adult out of the&#13;
parental home: all these choices affecting MHS are least accessible to poor&#13;
households. Yet poor households moat need these choicest to help them plan to&#13;
avoid dangerous periods of stress, in whioh 1S might overstretch supportive&#13;
working capaoity (given the household members' ages, the demands and rewards&#13;
for their economic activity, and their mutual domestio requirements).&#13;
On the other hand, poor households, more than others, suffer if&#13;
affeoted by unoontrolled variables ohanging 4S1, and altering the planned&#13;
balance between needs and production oapaoities. The "Yale school" (Schultz,&#13;
1981) persuasively argues that most households, rioh or poor, aot as if the&#13;
parents planned the demographio variables, inoludingt by implioation, the&#13;
time-path of MH3. However, the variables listed above - oomplexity,&#13;
pull-migration, later marriage, out-of-household training - are in today's&#13;
LICs usually muoh less open to poor couples than to rioh couples. In&#13;
deoiding how many children they want, and perhaps sometimes even the oare or&#13;
food that eaoh sex of child will receive, poor couples remain able implicitly&#13;
to aot as if they "ohose" other variables - the central demographic ones of&#13;
fertility and mortality - determining the time-path of M34. But these latter&#13;
choioes are much more uncertain than the "rich oouplea' ohooseables" in the&#13;
previous paragraph. For example, by remaining oomplex, a household almost&#13;
enaurest for some years, bigger size and different structure than if it had&#13;
split into simple nuclear households; but by oontrolling fortilityt especially&#13;
with pro-modern means of birth-oontrol, a sexually aotive couple implicitly&#13;
"chooses" the expected value of 31S (along its time-path) only with a very&#13;
high coefficient of variation.&#13;
The greater oapaoity of richer households explioitly to ahoose, with&#13;
low uncertainty, variables adapting M1S time-trends to those of available&#13;
Oonsumables is strengthened by two faotors. First, rioher households are&#13;
better able to buy information, e.g. about birth-oontrol methods or migratory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
prospects. Second, richer households are less pressed than poor households&#13;
to adapt ohoices affeoting MHS to short-run requirements of production and&#13;
earning - e.g. to the need for young teenagers to contribute family income&#13;
(in excess of their oonsumption) by performing particular tasks - and can&#13;
thus emphasize oonsumption-MHS balances more, when planning the time-path of&#13;
MHS.&#13;
The evidenoe suggests some worsening, as between pre-industrial NDCs&#13;
and today's LICs, in the disadvantages of the poor in planning, with&#13;
reasonable certainty, MHS time-paths that reduce the risk of periods of&#13;
consumption stress. In some respects, little has changed. Of the&#13;
MHS-influencing variables with fairly clear outcomes, complexity remains an&#13;
option much more readily open to better-off people (though a somewhat less&#13;
rare option, perhaps, in today's LICs than in most NDC history). However,&#13;
"going into service", as an option to out parental MHS (and usually to delay&#13;
marriage), was chosen by very large proportions of the poor in NDC history,&#13;
but is available to much smaller proportions of the LIC poor today.&#13;
Conversely, delayed marriage - historically the response of poor young adults&#13;
either to poverty or to emergency - has in today's LICs become the response&#13;
of the better-off to the prospect of further education.&#13;
The upshot is not merely that the historical correlation between big&#13;
households and rich households has been reversed, but that this has happened&#13;
in a way especially damaging to the relative capacity of poor households so&#13;
to plan MHS as to reduce consumption stress.   Traditionally the NDC rich -&#13;
despite having more servants, etc., in the household - had markedly higher&#13;
ratios of children (under 10-12) to adults than did the poor. In most LICs&#13;
today, the poor - despite a rather low rate of transfer, out of their&#13;
households, of adolescents and young adults "going into service" - have much&#13;
higher child/adult ratios than the non-poor. This rise in poor couples'&#13;
relative dependency burdens (i) reduces their chances of escaping poverty,&#13;
except to the (rather small?) extent that poverty is a life-cycle phenomenon,&#13;
aotually overlapping only with the period of high dependency; (ii) means that&#13;
ohildren, being heavily ooncentrated into poor households, tend as a group&#13;
(and especially in suoh households) to be with adults who must give priority&#13;
to immediate earning over child-oare and -socialization; and (iii) in the&#13;
case of extreme poverty (Lipton, 1983), concentrates on under-fives where the&#13;
parental couple oannot avoid nutritional risk to their healthy development, or&#13;
even survival.&#13;
To over-simplify, the better-off in LICs are able to respond to&#13;
reduced mortality with a faster, more explicitly volitional, less bumpy&#13;
"demographic transition" than are the poor. This has major policy importance&#13;
- not, of course, because polioymakers should, or perhaps oan, intervene in&#13;
(for example) the extent to which poor households send adolescents into&#13;
resident domestic servioel But the importance of the issue is not matched by&#13;
our information or analysis. (It will have been observed that much of my&#13;
information on variables affecting MHS is from a handful of NDC-historioal&#13;
sources, plus a handful of LIC village studies and national samples.) Hence&#13;
the summary in Table 6 is extremely tentative.&#13;
Table 6 takes the seven key household variables affecting MHS:&#13;
mortality, couple fertility, duration of fertile unions, complexity,&#13;
migration, family-cycles, and non-family membership. For eaoh variable, we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
ask two sets of questions. First, does it help "link" poverty to high MHSs&#13;
in today's LICJ, or to small ones in pre-industrial NDC., or to explain the&#13;
reversal of the "MH3A-NH" relationship? Second, does the variable help&#13;
"link" high status to high MHS, in pre-industrial NDC8 and in oontemporary&#13;
LICs alike - and to explain the paradox in the latter, with high MRS linked to&#13;
high status, jobs, assets, etc. and yet to poverty also?&#13;
This summary sub-section has said little about the status-MRS link,&#13;
though it was half of the paradox with whioh we began (p. 13). Mainly, that&#13;
is because Table 6 summarizes most of the (highly tentative) findings.&#13;
However, two other points are perhaps worth drawing out. First, the positive&#13;
status-size link may represent a time-lag: people's income, and the assooiated&#13;
MHS-related and other behaviour, ohanges more readily than the status, assets,&#13;
jobs eto. that, wholly or partly, they inherit. Seoond, the fate of children&#13;
may be worst in a high-status but low-income household, whioh is pushed by&#13;
both income and status into a child/adult ratio and MHS exceeding what can be&#13;
safely supported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
III. POVERTY AND HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION&#13;
(a) Composition. MRS. and Doverty definitions&#13;
How are the household's risks of poverty related to the age of its&#13;
members (inoluding the household head, HH), and hence to its dependency&#13;
burden? How does the sex-composition interact with poverty risk? How do&#13;
these effects wary over the family's development, from marriage to household&#13;
separation, widowhood, etc.? These three issues of houwehold composition are&#13;
dealt with in sub-aections (b), (c) and (d) below. The composition of a&#13;
household, however, is not rigorously separable from the issues of&#13;
poverty-MRS relationships treated in Sec. II, nor from those of demography and&#13;
poverty-measurement in Sec. IV.&#13;
The interaction of poverty risk and household composition with MHS&#13;
is exemplified by the effect of HR's sex. On pp. 51-3 we suggest that, on&#13;
most evidence, female-headed households are as suoh little, if any, more&#13;
likely to be poor in LICs than are other households. If we ignored MHS, this&#13;
faot could wrongly be taken to imply that women's "disadvantages" as household&#13;
heads were small. However, we have seen (p. 13) that female-headedness, in&#13;
NDC history and in today's LICs, typically accompanies much smaller MHS -&#13;
saller by 25-45% on most data sets. Smallness normally, in today's LICs,&#13;
accompanies higher MEP and lower poverty-risk (Sec. II(b)). Female-headed&#13;
households, being typically muoh smaller, "should be" less poor. They are&#13;
not; and this itself suggests female disadvantage. (Of course, to show a&#13;
positive partial oorrelation - holding MKS oonstant - between poverty-risk, or&#13;
low HEP, and female-headedness is to restate the problem, not to explain it.)&#13;
Our findings about household composition as a correlate of poverty&#13;
are bound to depend, too, on how we measure poverty. Also, a good indicator&#13;
of "poverty" will, explicitly or implicitly, divide real household income or&#13;
expenditure by an appropriately weighted indicator of the requirements of the&#13;
household's men, women, and different age-groups of children.  For a&#13;
potentially poor household in LICs, explicit division of monthly expenditure&#13;
by the household's "size" in Lusk CUs is not a bad indicator of satisfaction&#13;
of requirements; indeed, even monthly expenditure per person is tolerable,&#13;
since it ranks households not too differently from expenditure per Lusk CU&#13;
(Seo. I(o)). However, findings about composition-poverty linkages depend on,&#13;
and affeot, ohoices of indicator. For example, the use of "food/outlay ratio&#13;
above 75-80%" as an indicator of severe risk of poverty - while it has some&#13;
attractions as a short out (Lipton, 1983, Sec. II(b)) - probably overstates&#13;
that risk among households with many small ohildren and understates it among&#13;
other households. 27/ A similar, but more rigorous, critique of the Engel&#13;
procedure is given by Deaton and Muellbauer (1983, pp.23-4), who suggest&#13;
alternative methods of "equivalenoe soaling" - iM]lioit divison of MEP by an&#13;
index of the absorption of welfare likeliest to be caused by the household's&#13;
size and age-aex composition.&#13;
In what follows, we are usually foroed by data shortages to use MBE,&#13;
rather than per CU, as a poverty indicator. This is probably not a very&#13;
serious distortion (Seo. IV(c)), but may invalidate some of the "oloser"&#13;
finding and hunches about relationships of poverty to household oamposition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
(b) Age-composition. dependency, and the risk of poverty&#13;
Two issues arise. The first, allowing the more alear-out&#13;
conolusions, is how MEP, risk of poverty, eto. vary with the age-composition&#13;
and hence dependency-ratio (DR) of the household. 28/   While poor households&#13;
in today's LICs (especially, on the Indian evidence, in towns) have muoh&#13;
higher proportions of very young people than do the better-off households,&#13;
the curves may well flatten as we descend into extreme poverty, so that the&#13;
ultra-poor and the poor feature rather similar (high) child/adult ratios.&#13;
The second issue is the relationship between poverty and the age of the HH.&#13;
Here, we find complex and conflicting results in different areas. The results&#13;
differ not only in the linearity (and even sign) of the relationship, but&#13;
also in its differential impact on men and women. This suggests that we must&#13;
either fall back on the evasion, "culture-specificity" (which amounts to a&#13;
denial that we can ever, in general, know what characteristics poor or&#13;
ultra-poor people are likely to have), or else find intervening variables&#13;
affecting the shape of the curve linking poverty to age of HH. Part of the&#13;
problem is that the effect on risk of poverty if HHs are older due to later&#13;
marriage (or remarriage) is different from the effect if the HH is older&#13;
because further along the family cycle following a marriage at the national&#13;
average age.&#13;
A useful useful analysis of the relationship between age-structure&#13;
and poverty is Visaria (1977), based on the 1972-3 NSS. To ensure that these&#13;
results are not special to the two Indian States reviewed (Maharashtra and&#13;
Gujarat) or the year, we have also looked at 1973-4 data; at all-India and&#13;
Rajasthan data; and briefly at other States. These series confirm:&#13;
- that the proportion of persons aged 30-44 seems to vary little, and&#13;
unsystematically, around 16-18% with changing MEP;&#13;
- that the proportion of persons over 60 rises only gently (though&#13;
persistently) with increasing household MEP, e.g. from 3.4% in the&#13;
poorest decile in urban Gujarat to 5.9% in the richest quintile&#13;
(Table 7);&#13;
- that the (much larger) proportion of persons under 14, except among&#13;
the poorest 5-10% of households, decreases sharply as household MEP&#13;
declines, especially in urban areas, e.g. from 49.6% in the poorest&#13;
deoile to 20.5% in the richest quintile in urban Maharashtra&#13;
(Table 7);&#13;
- that, therefore (and espeoially in towns), not only child/adult&#13;
ratios, but also DRs, rise sharply as poverty presses harder, with&#13;
some alleviation of the increasing trend in the poorest decile.&#13;
Table 7 also shows most of these features, more sharply in towns&#13;
than in villages; and all this is confirmed by 1973-4 data. 29/ Moreover,&#13;
the clear poverty-DR link is not just Indian. In 1969-70 there were 1319&#13;
under-fourteens and over-sixties per 1000 persons aged 15-59 in the poorest&#13;
household deolle in Sri Lanka, 1138 in the seoond-poorest, 798 in the middle&#13;
quintile, and 506 for the richest doclle. Comparable figures for urban Nepal&#13;
(1973-4) were 1279, 1135, 783 and 417; and for Maharashtra (1972-3), 1203,&#13;
1037, 733 and 331 urban, and 1304, 1203, 960, and 776 rural. For nine South&#13;
Asian data sets that rank household (MEP deoiles) by DRa, the simple r's&#13;
between MEP decile-rank and DR range from -.973 to -.997 (Visaria, 1980,&#13;
Table 4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
Table 8 shows the effect, for three Indian States, among "riner"&#13;
MCP-groups. Most of the cellwise sub-samples are quite large. They suggest a&#13;
child/adult ratio that clearly falls as HEP rises - but only arter some (very&#13;
low) threshold MEP is reached. No clear link exists for the poorest 8-14% of&#13;
households in rural Gujarat (4-11% in urban areas), and for the poorest 6-11%&#13;
(8-14% urban) in Maharashtra. Other States JO/ show similar thresholds - for&#13;
DRa as for MHS (ft. 11) - as do the all-India urban data (the all-India rural&#13;
aeries in Table 8 seems to show a smooth rise in child/adult ratios even at&#13;
extreme poverty levelst but the Statewise data show that this is an&#13;
"ecological fallacy"). Although some of this flattening-out of the rise of&#13;
child/adult ratios with increasing poverty is caught even in the "rougher"&#13;
analysis of Table 7 (of. the data for rural older children), a flattening-out&#13;
of the ratio, if it applied to no more households than the poorest 10-14% or&#13;
so, would not be fully captured by the deoile-wise data. Table 8 shows it&#13;
olearly.&#13;
This flattening-out is especially important if, as Tables 8 and 12&#13;
and fn. 11 suggest, it oorresponds to similar flattening among the ultra-poor&#13;
of the (otherwise positive) MHS-poverty relationship. Subsets of each of the&#13;
poorest 2-5 MEP groups in Table 8 - subsets making up increasing proportions&#13;
of groups as poverty deepens - are in households unable to afford enough&#13;
calories to safeguard under-fives from periodio risk of serious growth&#13;
faltering, and/or of Grade III undernutrition; unlike the mild-to-moderate&#13;
undernutrition assooiated with less extreme poverty, this signifioantly raises&#13;
infant and child mortality (Chen, 1980; Lipton, 1983), and probably depresses&#13;
fertility (Frisoh, 1978, 1982). The very poor, like the moderately poor, are&#13;
subject to economic-demographic pressures that tend to reduce average&#13;
household age, increase child/adult ratios, and thus raise MHS as poverty&#13;
deepens; but for the very poor, unlike the moderately poor, these pressures&#13;
are offset by the physical and health impacts of undernutrition on births,&#13;
IMR, and child deaths. Hence, for the very poor - unlike the moderately poor&#13;
- a clear relationship of MEP to child/adult ratios or MHS may not emerge.&#13;
These interpretations are tentative. A few sub-samples in Table 8&#13;
are rather small (though consistent, and cumulatively suggestive). Less-poor&#13;
LDCs - perhaps lacking suffiioent physioal pressures, even among the poorest,&#13;
to oonstrain fertility (Frisoh, 1978, 1982) - may show no "flattening" of&#13;
ohild-adult ratio increases as MEP falls; there is a steady relationship for&#13;
urban Colombla through all MEP deoiles (Birdsall, 1979, p. 130). Nor are&#13;
plausible data from localized village or urban surveys available. But the&#13;
smaller families, and lower ohild/adult ratios, among rural laborers (p. 12)&#13;
are suggestive; that group overlaps strongly with the ultra-poor. Moreover, a&#13;
turning-point in M1S and child/adult ratioa, around ultra-poverty, would&#13;
oonform to a general pattern of turning-points in nutritional and labor-market&#13;
behavior (Lipton, 1983 and 1983a). Among other variables, age- and&#13;
sex-speoific participation rates, food/outlay ratios and now perhaps&#13;
child/adult ratios and even 1411 - while they rise, up to a point, as poverty&#13;
Dresses harder - seem to reach a oeiling, perhaps associated with physical&#13;
ill-effects from extreme poverty, above whioh further rises with ultra-poverty&#13;
are very small, absent, or negative. Some of these variables help oause or&#13;
maintain poverty; some of them (not necessarily different ones), poverty helps&#13;
to oause or maintain; and some are comon causes or consequenoes, alongside&#13;
poverty, of different variables. That is one reason why we seek&#13;
characteristics, not causes, of poverty and ultra-poverty. But DRa do conform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
to a pattern of observations that the ultra-poor in LICs, while plainly not an&#13;
underclass, are "different from us" and also from the moderately poor.&#13;
Only for Gujarat is there substantial evidenoe on whether these&#13;
dramatic differences in age-structure, as between poor and poorest and others,&#13;
are sex-speoific. In rural areas, this seems not to be signfioantly the oase.&#13;
Boys (age 0-14) comprised 50.2S of males in the poorest deoile of rural&#13;
GuJarat's homes in 1972-3, and girls 51.0% of females; in the top decile the&#13;
corresponding proportions were 32.2% and 32.3% At the other end of the rural&#13;
lifespan, too, the proportions of males and females aged over 60 were similar&#13;
in any given MEP decile (though as usual old women greatly outnumbered old men&#13;
in each deoile); sex-selectivity did not aocount for the much greater presenoe&#13;
of old persons in better-off rural households (Visaria, 1977, Tables 1-2).&#13;
In urban Oujarat, espeoially among the poorest MEP decile of&#13;
households, males clearly contributed more than females to the very high&#13;
conoentration of the "young-end" dependency burden upon poorer households:&#13;
51.8% of males in the poorest deoile of households were under 14 (37.1% being&#13;
aged 5-14) as against 48.3% of females (33.5% aged 5-14); in the richest&#13;
deoile, only 19.8% of males, but 25.6% of females, were aged under 14 (ibid.,&#13;
Table 2). This is an interesting pendant to the finding (pp. 48-50) that, in&#13;
muoh of India and perhaps in other LICs, the huge exoess of men over women in&#13;
the towns deoreases as MEP falls, and is reversed in the poorest deoile.&#13;
The Gujarat data do not suggest that the poorest seleotively deprive&#13;
small girls of care or food. If suoh deprivation killa, it is almost&#13;
certainly at ages 0-4 (where alone it is evident in Bangladesh: Chen et al.,&#13;
1981). Yet, despite the (world-wide) excess of male births, in both rural and&#13;
urban areas the proportion of lowest-decile females aged 0-4 is greater than&#13;
the proportion of lowest-deoile males. It would be valuable to see data for&#13;
other States (e.g. Maharashtra, where rural-urban migration and return&#13;
migration, and severely unbalanoed sex-ratios, especially in specific&#13;
age-groups, are more important than in Gujarat), and for LICs other than&#13;
India.&#13;
Visaria's Asian data (1980, Table 4) suggest that this DR gap between&#13;
poorest, poor and others will, unless attaoked by specific policies, worsen&#13;
with development. (This is not to say that the poor will get absolutely&#13;
poorer; only that a worsening dependency ratio will provide an inoreasingly&#13;
severe obstacle to their advance relative to the less-poor). First, the gap&#13;
is larger in towns, both because urban sex-ratios beoome more balanood as&#13;
poverty increases (p. 48) sO that more children can be prooreated per adult,&#13;
and because the return of older persons to the villages for retirement reduces&#13;
the DR of the rich relative to the poor (who have a much smaller proportion of&#13;
older persons). So, as urbanisation prooeeds, people move to places where (a)&#13;
the rich-poor gap in the DR is bigger, and (b) the impaot of growth, in&#13;
widening the gap, is greater. Second, less-poor areas of Asia as a whole -&#13;
Taiwan, Malaysia, even urban India and Nepal - tend to feature muoh greater&#13;
inter-deoile differences in DRs than some poorer places such as rural Gujarat&#13;
and Maharashtra, and Sri Lanka (Visaria, 1980, p.65); development may well be&#13;
widening the DR gap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
While age-composition and DRs of households are quite systematically&#13;
related to poverty in LICs today, the curve relating age of HH (x) to risk of&#13;
poverty (y) is very obscure. If the only factors at work were decisions on&#13;
age of marriage (household formation) and death-rates of partners, a simple&#13;
curve - monotonic decreasing - could be expected, because poorer people&#13;
clearly tend to marry younger in LICs now, 31/ while adult life expectancy is&#13;
somewhat (not very much) lower among poorer groups, leaving very old HHs&#13;
accounting for rather smaller proportions of the poor than of the rich.&#13;
If we could trace the marriage of an LIC couple, "average" in respect&#13;
of level of poverty and the partners' ages upon marriage, through the risk of&#13;
poverty, a more complicated but still clear-cut curve  --_______     - shaped -&#13;
can be inferred from family-cycle considerations. On marriage, both partners&#13;
often can work, and sometimes there are wedding-gifts to enhance&#13;
living-standards. Soon, poverty-risk rises as small children arrive, cutting&#13;
per-person income by sharing what the household receives, and sometimes by&#13;
requiring child care and stopping the mother from earning, 32/ cutting total&#13;
household income too. Later, poverty-risk is cut, both by inheritance and as&#13;
children reach earning age-groups. Later still, poverty-risk rises: the&#13;
oouple is likelier to get ill, and earning children leave home (and maybe fail&#13;
to remit money). Almost exactly this curve is found in a big 1974 Malaysian&#13;
sample (Datta and Meerman, 1980, p. 13).&#13;
Is the HH-age to poverty-risk function a sum of --       and&#13;
effects?  Unfortunately it is more complicated.  The latter curve&#13;
related to an "average" LIC couple in respect of marriage-age and poverty at&#13;
marriage. A poorer couple at marriage - which tends to marry earlier -&#13;
follows the latter curve, but (apart from, obviously, showing a higher&#13;
probability of poverty than a richer couple) has fluctuations of a different&#13;
amplitude. Poor households' poverty risk as a proportion of their lifetime&#13;
average (as against less poor households' proportion) is lowered immediately&#13;
after marriage by relatively high female participation rates (poorer women are&#13;
much likelier to seek work: Lipton, 1983a) and correspondingly is raised as&#13;
small children arrive - because (i) more participation is desired, and hence&#13;
frustrated, than for better-off women; (ii) extended-family help in child-care&#13;
is less available (pp. 30-1); (iii) for the poorest, high death-rates for&#13;
under-fives (pp. 15-16) raise the ratio of younger children needing maternal&#13;
care to older children contributing to work.&#13;
The comonly explored linear relationships between poverty-risk (or&#13;
MEP) and age of HH - sometimes with an added element for the square of age of&#13;
HH (e.g. Gaiha, 1983) - therefore, not surprisingly, produce no clear-cut&#13;
results. A logit analysis of 4105 rural Indian households in 1968-69, using a&#13;
(somewhat high) poverty-line of Rs.355 income-per-head per year, suggested&#13;
that the logarithm of risk of falling below it rose by .067 (significant at&#13;
2.5%) for each rise of one year in HH age. 3U/ However, the corresponding&#13;
coefficients for the 2350 cultivating households showed inconsistent results&#13;
in different years, neither significant at 2.5% (.0697 in 1968, sig. at 5%;&#13;
-.0106 in 1970, n.s.). This also applied to the 900-odd oasual-labor&#13;
households (Gaiha, 1983, Tables 13, 18, 19).&#13;
We have seen robust relationships between poverty risk and&#13;
age-structures, MRS and child/adult ratios (e.g. Tables 8, 12). However,&#13;
Gaiha's large, disaggregable, three-year Indian rural sample suggests that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
orude linear regressions of poverty risk on HH age - with or without ageg -&#13;
are unstable and weak. Gaiha's data set is more useful in exploring poverty&#13;
risk by five-year HH-age groups (Gaiha and Kaymi, 1982, pp.6, 57). In&#13;
1968-69, 61.01 of the 4105 households were "poor" (income-per-head below&#13;
Rs.29.6).  Only seven such households (and eight others) had HH under 20, but&#13;
for older five-year age-groups the cell size was substantial; the proportions&#13;
with income-per-head below Rs.29.6 were: HH aged 20-24, 66.9%; 25-29, 69.6%;&#13;
30-34, 65.6%; 35-39, 68.0%; 40-44, 69.0%; 45-49, 70.1%; 50-54, 66.9%; 55-59,&#13;
62.5%; 60-64, 57.5%; and 65-69, 54.8%. The pattern that 'the bottom deciles&#13;
include a higher-than-average proportion of middle-aged heads of households'&#13;
is confirmed for several South Asian samples - probably (Visaria, 1980, p.53)&#13;
because 4HS is usually highest for iiddle-aged HHs.&#13;
Two sidelights on these data are available.. From Malaysia - one of&#13;
the several countries where Visaria confirmed that risk of poverty (y) was&#13;
related to age of HH (x) in a ----N-E -curve - another very oareful survey&#13;
analysis instead revealed a simpler e-~-     -curve, but it excluded&#13;
one-person households and did not disaggregate the over-fifties (Hazumdar,&#13;
1981, pp.3, 36-9); this suggests that the downturn in poverty-risk among older&#13;
HHs owes much to the over-60s, and/or to single persons who can live alone as&#13;
HHs (instead of with younger, earning HHs) only if better-off. From rural&#13;
Botswana, where male migration to the S. African mines leaves many female HHs,&#13;
another careful survey (for 1974-75) suggests that the downturn in&#13;
poverty-risk is closely linked to faster asset accretion by male HHs.&#13;
"Households headed by women under 30 earn as much as households headed by men&#13;
under 30. However, beyond that age incomes in male-headed households rise&#13;
substantially, while those in female-headed households decline" (Kossoudji and&#13;
Mueller, 1980, p.12). The latter finding has an anafogue from an otherwise&#13;
totally different "developing" environment, that of Belo Horizonte, Brazil;&#13;
poverty in female-headed households, as compared with male-headed, is muoh&#13;
more heavily ooncentrated where the HH is of prime age (15-59), although poor&#13;
prime-age households tend to have lower DRs if female-headed (Merrick and&#13;
Sohmink, 1982, pp.303-4). Probably - in urban Brazil as in rural Botswana -&#13;
it is the barriers and diffioulties faced by women in aecess - to post-primary&#13;
education, and later to eapital and jobs - that explain growing female&#13;
disadvantage as mHs after age 30.&#13;
The relationship of age of HH to household poverty is complex, but of&#13;
enormous polioy importance. Peak incidence of poverty among HHs in mid-span,&#13;
say 35-45, probably means most conoentration of damage on small children,&#13;
where health and nutrition are likeliest to suffer irreversibly. (Indeed,&#13;
this is also implied in the strong positive link of poverty to DRs; see&#13;
pp. 43-5.) Second, it also makes for relatively good chances of remedy:&#13;
households at greatest risk are headed by persons of prime working age&#13;
(although their oapacity to work may be limited by ohild-oare and high DNs).&#13;
Third, muoh of the age-poverty pattern Is not life-eyolioal, but is due to&#13;
poor people's earlier marriage and lesser access to post-primary education&#13;
(from whioh benefits aocrue mostly in later life), and to the need for&#13;
desperately poor old persons to cease being HHs, and to join younger Hms to&#13;
survive; enemies of poverty cannot, therefore, happily assume that - because&#13;
poverty riak falls after HH age 45-55 - partioular households "grow out of&#13;
poverty". Finally, the sex distribution among HHs of asset aocretion is&#13;
uneven, so that male-headed and female-headed households may show quite&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
different links between poverty and HH age.&#13;
(c) Are women poorer?&#13;
Much of the reoent literature of development (for instance Buvinic&#13;
et al., 1981) gives a fairly uniform picture of female disadvantage.&#13;
Elsewhere in these papers, a much more mixed position has been suggested.&#13;
Selective, dangerous undernutrition, relative to males in the same households,&#13;
seems to be confined to Bangladesh and Northern India (Lipton, 1983).&#13;
Labor-market discrimination against women (i) reduces their access to (and&#13;
training for) work with better earnings prospects, (ii) is expressed in a&#13;
wider sense through the societal pressures on women to work a "double day" at&#13;
home and at work, but (ill) does not, in most LIC conditions, take the form of&#13;
much less reward for identical work (Lipton, 1983a).&#13;
In respect of the two main issues affeoting female demography and&#13;
poverty - the incidence of women in poorer groups, and the problem faced by&#13;
female-headed households - the data also suggest something other than&#13;
generalised disadvantage. Women outnumber men significantly not in poor&#13;
households as a whole, but only in the very poorest 1-5%, whioh are so poor&#13;
owing to high child/adult ratios (atypical of female-headed households, even&#13;
poor ones) or a high incidence of unsupported widowhood; and to some extent in&#13;
poorer urban households. The respective remedies are to provide women with&#13;
means and power to limit births, and to ease their path to effective migration&#13;
decisions.&#13;
Visaria's analysis of decile-wise data for Maharashtra and Gujarat in&#13;
1972-3 showed that the ratio of women to men aged 15-59 "showed no clear&#13;
tendenoy to rise with tMEP] decile in rural areas", but did so in towns&#13;
(Visaria, 1977, p.14). However, in the poorest, second, and third deciles of&#13;
urban households, this ratio was respectively 0.993, 1.022 and 1.029 in&#13;
Gujarat; and 0.995, 1.033 and 1.070 in Maharashtra (ibid., pp.8A-8B). Very&#13;
slightlv more urban men than women aged 15-59 were ultra-Door or poor. The&#13;
real problem was that women's chances of escape - either from rural poverty&#13;
via townward migration, or from urban poverty via upward mobility - were far&#13;
less than men's. Thus, by the time the top urban decile was reaohed, the&#13;
urban male-female ratio was 1.171 in Gujarat, and 1.437 in Maharashtra (ibid.,&#13;
pp. 8A-8B).&#13;
The effects of this on the poor (a) damage women through migratory&#13;
and child-related processes rather than through discrimination against&#13;
localized women with given child/women ratios, (b) are political, rather than&#13;
overtly reflected in economic outcomes. Before dealing with them, I look at&#13;
four other issues. First, is India's apparent "equality in poverty" of the&#13;
sexes - their near-balance in the poorest deciles - paralleled in other areas&#13;
of South Asia, and in other LICs? Soeond, does the appearance result from&#13;
looking only at persons aged 15-59? Related to this issue is the question of&#13;
whether single, divorced or widow/widower status - or household size - affects&#13;
poverty-risk differently for men and for women. Finally, if these&#13;
considerations confirm that any over-representation of women among the poorest&#13;
MEP deciles appears to be relatively small in most LICs (Visaria, 1980, p.62,&#13;
for Asian evidence), "examination of data for smaller groups of households ...&#13;
might show a different picture" (ibid., p. 63): does it?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
The first two questions are addressed Jointly by Visaria (1980,&#13;
pp. 58, 61). His nine South Asian samples for 1969-75 all show the proportion&#13;
of females of all ages 34/ in eaoh household MNP deoile.35/   This proportion&#13;
falls signifioantly 36/ with rising affluence only in urban Maharashtra (from&#13;
50% in the poorest decile to 41% in the riohest, in 1972-3) and urban Nepal&#13;
(51% to 42% in the 11-town sample for 1973-4, and 52% to 36% in the 7-town&#13;
sample for 1974-5). The really important point, however, is that once more&#13;
there is no signfioant over-representation of females in the poorer groups -&#13;
the peroentage even in the bottom docile of households is below 53% in all&#13;
nine samples. Females of all ages In these South Asian oases - like adult&#13;
women in Western India (p. 48) - do not comprise unduly high proportions of&#13;
the urban or rural poor, but are much less likely than the male poor to beomoe&#13;
urban and affluent. We have little evidence from outside South Asia, but&#13;
nutritional (Schofield, 1979) and other reports confirm that women are less&#13;
likely to be over-represented among the poor in non-Asian LICs.&#13;
There are some caveats in respeot of the statement that poor&#13;
households in most LICs do not show female/male ratios muoh above unity.&#13;
Reverting to the third of our "issues" (p. 48), divoroed or widowed status&#13;
appears to worsen women's poverty prospeots more than men's, espeoially for&#13;
Hsa (p. 52). This may well apply with special force to cultures where&#13;
husbands can, with relative ease, divorce or abandon their wives; in two&#13;
villages in Bangladesh, females oomprised 57% and 52% of landless households,&#13;
but 47% and 45% respectively of the "self-sufficient" (better-off landed)&#13;
households (Mahmud and McIntosh, 1980, p. 504), and the role of widowhood in&#13;
suoh oases is well documented (e.g. Cain, 1981). Households without adult&#13;
couPles, however, may be linked to male as well as female poverty: there ia&#13;
aome evidence from rural India that households with adult male/female ratios&#13;
very far from unity in either direction are exoeptionally prone to poverty&#13;
(Oaiha and Kazmi, 1982, p. 23).&#13;
As for the final issue raised on p. 48, the data confirm the hunch&#13;
(Visaria, 1980, p. 63) that "smaller groups of households than deoiles might&#13;
show a different picture". Table 9 shows quite substantial "surpluses" of&#13;
women among the poorest 3-5 peroent of both urban and rural Indiana. This is&#13;
oonsistent with the (much smaller) State samples.&#13;
Women's hard life, and Its link to low-KR householda, cannot however&#13;
be assessed by that NBP alone. Poorer groups of households (Table 9) have a&#13;
much higher ratio of children to adult women. Female levels of well-being are&#13;
thus lowered among the poor, in ways not revealed by NLP (and increasingly as&#13;
poverty bites harder), but the need to ohild-mind as well as earnlng - a need&#13;
made more oneroua by higher direot economic participation among the poor&#13;
(Lipton, 1983a) - mean more frequent "double days" of housework and earnings.&#13;
Women'a well-being is also more likely to be lowered, as poverty deepona, by&#13;
numerous pregnanoies (see Harrington, 1982, on Nigeria), all too often ending&#13;
in stillbirths or infant deaths. Both these facts are hinted at by Table 9.&#13;
In the poorest fifth of Indian households, there were almost two ohildren per&#13;
adult women - far above the average.&#13;
This is confirmed not only at State level (Table 9) but also by four&#13;
village samples in Gujarat in 1970-71. The poorest 18 households (100&#13;
persons) did not "overrepresent women" (there were, indeed, 1.08 adult males&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
per adult female), but imposed on each woman 1.92 children. The best-ott 19&#13;
households (101 persons) had a larger share in the local "surplus" of adult&#13;
males - 1.40 per adult female - but only 0.96 children per adult woman (V.&#13;
Patel, 1973, p. ix).&#13;
In the poorer households, then, a high ohild/female ratio, rather&#13;
than (except in the very poorest 5% or so) female over-representation, is the&#13;
main female-specific "burden of poverty". At national and political level,&#13;
the data once more suggest that it is not female surplus among the poor, but&#13;
male surplus among the decision-making and educated urban rich, that&#13;
constitutes women's "poverty problem". In 1972-3, in urban Maharashtra, there&#13;
were 127 men aged 15-59 per 100 women in the second-richest household&#13;
quintile, 138 in the second-richest decile, and 144 in the richest - and&#13;
presumably most influential - deoile (Visaria, 1977, p. 8B). 3/&#13;
This has several important effects. First, men dominate politics,&#13;
especially in LICs; probably, the more localized and "economic" the issues,&#13;
the greater the male dominance. Thus, though there is not a big female&#13;
surplus among the poor, the concentration of urban men among the better-orff&#13;
and of urban women among the poor, increases the relative weakness of the poor&#13;
and of the women alike. Second, the dominance of the urban sector in&#13;
political decision-making is strengthened by the overlap of maleness with&#13;
higher incomes in the cities. Third, the higher male/female ratios among the&#13;
top deciles, especially but not only in the town, increase the dominance of&#13;
the rich. Fourth, access to education is, notoriously, less among women,&#13;
especially in remote and rural places (see, for example, Deijomeah and&#13;
Anusionwu, 1979, p. 52; Visaria, 1980, p. 75). Insofar as women concentrate&#13;
in rural and poorer urban groups, there is mutual reinforcement among the&#13;
dominance of the educated, of the male, of the urban, and of the rich. All&#13;
four effects are probably understated by Table 9, because the sex-ratio in a&#13;
particular area among small children is usually near unity in all&#13;
income-groups and places, so that the dominance of males in adult urban elites&#13;
is even greater than the figures of Table 9 suggest (see fn. 37).&#13;
Tables 2 and 9 together show that in India the child/adult ratio&#13;
rises much more rapidly, with deepening poverty, than the female/male ratio -&#13;
which rises at all only in urban areas, and even there only a little, if at&#13;
all, above unity. This implies a sharp rise in child/female ratios with&#13;
poverty. We have discussed above the implications for adult women. But the&#13;
importance of this "characteristic of the poor" extends beyond one generation,&#13;
and to both sexes: to the social inheritance of disadvantage in "cycles of&#13;
poverty", via inevitably inadequate child stimulation and care.&#13;
Even more directly, income earned outside the home by rural women&#13;
makes much less contribution to children's nutritional status than does&#13;
own-farm income, given total MEP (Kumar, 1977). Similarly for urban areas: in&#13;
1969 Berg implicitly showed direct damage to child nutrition, given NEP, from&#13;
female faotory-work in urban Calcutta (Reutlinger and Selowsky, 1976). Yet it&#13;
is poorer women who have higher participation rates; who, even at any given&#13;
rate, are likelier (because they own few productive assets) to be pushed into&#13;
work outside the home (Lipton, 1983a); and who neither can afford domestio&#13;
employees, nor are likely to have access to complex household structures (pp.&#13;
29-31), to help with children. It is such poor women who, as we now see,&#13;
typioally each have more children; these are likely to "inherit" the losses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
consequent on their mother's more probably uncovered absencea. The orucial&#13;
importance, to ohild welfare in poor households, of appropriate income-earning&#13;
tasks, rewards and conditions for working mothers in the home - tasks often&#13;
glibly and uniformly dismissed as exploitative - is obvious in.the light of&#13;
such data as those of Table 9, and will be reoonsidered in a brief polioy&#13;
disoussion in Section V.&#13;
We have seen that poorer urban households usually have a near-balance&#13;
sex-ratio. However (Connell et al., 1976), the huge excesa of young men in&#13;
Asian and African rural-urban migrant streams (and hence in urban&#13;
family-farming age-groups) is also familiar. The oonsistenoy of these two&#13;
apparently contradictory facts - via great male predominance in rioher urban&#13;
groups; and oonsistently also with relatively high child/female ratios in the&#13;
poorer groups, whose women and espeoially children are most damaged by a high&#13;
ratio - effeotively oonstitutes a new demography of urban poverty. Poor&#13;
people in LIC towns are ooming to show adult male/female ratios around, or&#13;
even below, unity; the high overall urban ratios are due to very big male&#13;
surpluses among the better-off.&#13;
Partly, as work in Bombay (Joshi, 1976, esp. p. 1303) suggests, this&#13;
is because poor women have oome to form a rising proportion of urbanising&#13;
migrants. Partly it is because the urban "ladders to success" favor men (in&#13;
Botawana, women's disadvantage as migrants rests entirely in their worse urban&#13;
prospeots of employment and wage-levelsa and if these are held oonstant&#13;
women's propensity to move exoeeds men's: Lucas, 1982, p. 17). Partly, it is&#13;
because failed migrants tend to return to the village of origin (Connell&#13;
et al., 1976, pp. 126-8). Whatever the reason, the effeots of the new&#13;
demography of urban poverty upon women are not, for the most part, direot via&#13;
MEP. They operate at national level, by oonoentrating male and urban&#13;
Dolitioal advantage; at household level, by placing most ohildren in poor&#13;
families where women (and men) oan least afford to stay at home and care for&#13;
them; and, in both ways, by transmitting female disadvantage (which is not&#13;
crude absolute MBP disadvantage, for sex-ratios among the poor, exoept in the&#13;
very poorest 5% of households, are usually not very unbalanoed) from the&#13;
poorer 20-25% of mothers to both daughters and sons. These effects are all&#13;
felt in rural areas too, but they are perhaps strongest in cities. 3a8/&#13;
a     *     S&#13;
Are women in LICs - for social, eoonomic or other reasons - likelier&#13;
to be poor because they are in some sense demographic victims? The idea&#13;
oannot be simply supported by the available NEP data: sex-ratios are around&#13;
unity in most poor groups. However, the idea receives strong support from&#13;
subtler demographic evidence linked with those same data (elite concentration&#13;
of urban males; high child/female ratios for poor groups). Surprisingly&#13;
similar conclusions apply to the question of whether female HHs suffer special&#13;
disadvantages. Contrary to some interpretations, such households seem to&#13;
suffer little, if any, greater risk of very low HEP, when appropriate "other&#13;
things" are allowed for or held oonatant. But female HHs, like females in&#13;
general, do appear to suffer poverty-linked disadvantages not simply&#13;
associated with lower statio MIP itselft less chance of raiing MEP with time,&#13;
less adaptable household sizes and structures, more drawbaoka from (and&#13;
likelihood of) "poverty-fixing" form of oivil status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
Visaria notes oa small over-representation of females among HHls in&#13;
the bottom one or two deoiles in urban [Western India], Sri Tanka, Taiwan in&#13;
1968 [but not 1974] and Peninsular Malaysia; but ... not ... suoh as would&#13;
justify widespread oonoern". This, if anything, overstates the importanoe of&#13;
female-headedness as a oorrelate of poverty. The relationship of sex of HH to&#13;
poverty is extremely weak, even in these oases. In urban Haharashtra, for&#13;
example, 10.4% of HEH in the poorest deoile were female, but so were 10.7% in&#13;
the rioheat, and an average of 8.0% overall. In Malaysia (1973), 20.4% of&#13;
poorest-deoile households were female-headed, but 16.8% of seoond-poorest,&#13;
19.0% of seoond-riohest, and 18.1% overall (Visaria, 1980, pp. 54-5), and&#13;
another large survey found that average inoomes per person "by sex of&#13;
household head are identioal' as between male and female HHs (Datta and&#13;
Meerman, 1980, p. 8) so that any greater inoidenoe of poverty among the latter&#13;
would imply worse distribution among female HHs, whioh there is no obvious&#13;
reason to expect.&#13;
Suoh sex differentials in poverty as do exist between HHs 39/ are&#13;
dynamio, not statio. In partioular, they are due to the risk of widowed&#13;
status. 'Only 25% of all Indian males over 60 ... are without wives ... over&#13;
70% of all Indian women over 60 are widows" (Visaria, 1980); this is&#13;
attributed (Nugent and Walther, 1981, p. 34) to "higher remarriage rates for&#13;
husbands ... and ... sizeable age differentials ... at first marriage', but&#13;
the universally greater life expeotanoy of women at age 60 must play a major&#13;
role. Women thus run muoh greater risks of widowed status - and hence,&#13;
especially in the poorer household with its lower inoidence of oomplexity, of&#13;
depending on their sons' support - than do men; also, because widowers are&#13;
likelier than widows to own property, sons have less self-interest in&#13;
supporting a mother than a father after bereavement. Cain points to the sharp&#13;
oontrast between Islamio Bangladesh and India, in respect of the very severe&#13;
risk of desoent into destitution associated with widowhood in the former&#13;
(Cain, 1981, pp. 458-9). However, in a largely Hindu study area in Karnataka,&#13;
"the situation of a widow with no surviving sons oan be so bad that one&#13;
somtimes wonders that any woman would restriot her fertility and oourt even a&#13;
sm1ll ohanoe of suoh a fate ... Twelve widows live on their own in the study&#13;
area (5 per oent of all widows), some in miserable oonditions" (Caldwell&#13;
et al.9 1982, p. 28). It may well be, then, (i) that the differential risk&#13;
and effeot of widowed status explaina most of suoh disadvantage of female HHs&#13;
as oeists; (ii) that high fertility among the poor, partly to reduce the risks&#13;
inherent for them in suoh status, is a major indiroot effeot of Dotential&#13;
femle-headednesst an effoot by whioh poverty is deepened, not for&#13;
widow-headed households as suoh, but for all poor households - mostly&#13;
male-headed.&#13;
Data from Botana again stress the dynamios of female-headedness -&#13;
its association over time with other poverty-related phenomena. 'Households&#13;
headed by womn under 30 earn as muoh [per CU] as households headed by males&#13;
under 30.' However, beyond that age incomes per CU in the latter 'rise&#13;
substantially  while those in femle-headed households deoline' (Kossoudji and&#13;
Mueller, 1980, pp. 12, 14). Several faotors are probably at work heres&#13;
differential inoidenoe and impaot of widowhood (see above) and also of&#13;
abandoment and divorce; capacity to deoumulate savings out of past incomes&#13;
from (seleotively male) migration; and, perhaps above all, the effect of&#13;
se-bias In inheritance, education, and in other patterns of asset accretion.&#13;
Animal husbandry contributed 47% of income for working male HHs, but only 32%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
for female HHs with no working-age male in the household. Cattle value per&#13;
CU, respectively, was 261 Rand and 138 Rand (ibid., pp. 16, 24).&#13;
In general, female HHo as such may not have much greater poverty risk&#13;
than male HHs. But they "ought" to have much lower risk - for they tend to&#13;
have smaller households, lower child/adult ratios, and greater HH age.&#13;
Indeed, the demographio evidence (like that of other papers in this series)&#13;
does not deny that women, and female HHs, suffer special disadvantages&#13;
associated with poverty - notably the large part of life that poor women spend&#13;
in pregnancy and childbirth, often for children who die in infancy&#13;
(Harrington, 1982). However, women's disadvantages are iomobility, laok of&#13;
access, and hence more severe and less easily remediable effeots of poverty -&#13;
in job search, in migration, in food behaviour, and much else. To interpret&#13;
these disadvantages as a much greater, specifically female, risk of poverty at&#13;
each (static) moment is to neglect both the politics and the dynamios of the&#13;
problem. It is also usually incorrect.&#13;
(d) Life-cycles. poverty. and household eomDosition&#13;
In Section II(j) we asked whether domestic cycles might help to&#13;
explain the links between MHS, poverty, and status. Here, we lookc at these&#13;
cycles as possible "linkers" of poverty to age-structure and sex-structure.&#13;
Do the same households (for example) at one time show high child/female ratios&#13;
associated with high poverty risk, and at another time the low ratios&#13;
associated with low risk? A given percentage shortfall, behind some poverty&#13;
line, is less "inequitable" if it is experienced by (say) 80 percent of all&#13;
households for 10 percent of the time when a particular person is HH -&#13;
normally the 10% when under-fives are the largest proportion of household&#13;
members - rather than by 10 percent of households during 80 percent of a&#13;
particular headship. 40/&#13;
Unfortunately, any approach to such questions is hampered by shortage&#13;
of long-term panel data. Cross-seotion data are almost always ambiguous. For&#13;
instance, household income-per-person falls in Malaysia as the HH0s age rises&#13;
from 25 to 37.5 and again from 50 to 62.5 (Datta and Meerman, 1980, p.13).&#13;
This may be because the poor marry later (or separate sooner) within these&#13;
intervals; for life-cycle reasons; or because of changing economio oonditions,&#13;
e.g. permitting different savings rates over time.&#13;
Moreover, most survey data, one-shot or panel, are oollected at the&#13;
level of households or of individuals, but not at both levels. Yet&#13;
life-cycles that alter a household's age and sex composition eomonly detach&#13;
individuals from, or attaoh them to, pre-existing householda. Bspeoially with&#13;
one-shot surveys, but even to some extent with panel data, such processes are&#13;
unlikely to be "caught" unless surveys are conducted at both individual and&#13;
household levels.&#13;
To some extent, however, surveyed poverty - while understated by the&#13;
timing, looation and prooedures of moat surveys 41/ - is overstated beoause&#13;
life-cycle factors, of both MHS and composition, are ignored. Survey&#13;
estimates of one-period "proportions in poverty" (and Son indicess Son, 1981,&#13;
pp. 35-8) are maximum estimates of the impact of lifetime'poverty, and&#13;
normally overstate that impact. Suppose a population contains 50,000 persons,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
of constant age- and sex-structure in eaoh MEP group. Suppose that ten&#13;
suocessive yearly surveys all place 10,000 persons below a (constant) absolute&#13;
poverty line; that, in each survey, the MEP gaps between the poverty line and&#13;
the lowest, second-lowest ... 10,000th-lowest MEP are all identical; and that&#13;
the impact of a person's age and sex, upon his risk either of being in poverty&#13;
at all or of being above a particular MEP distance beneath the poverty line,&#13;
is identical at each of the ten surveys. Even then, the "head-count"&#13;
proportion of persons in absolute poverty (in fact 20%) - and the Sen index&#13;
(Sen, 1981, pp. 35-8) of poverty - calculated from each of the ten surveys&#13;
would, though both were unchanged in ten surveys, both be maximum estimates.&#13;
Unless every person, if and only if ever among the poorest 20% of people, were&#13;
alwaya among the poorest 20%, the head-count overestimates poverty incidence.&#13;
Unless the ranking of the poorest 20% never varies - not easy even to define&#13;
rigorously in a growing, or otherwise changing, population - the Sen. index&#13;
overestimates welfare impact on adults.&#13;
The main thing leading to changes in the composition of persons below&#13;
the poverty line, and to the ranking of those who remain below it, between&#13;
surveys is the life-cycle. This fact, indeed, points up the seriousness of&#13;
even transitory poverty: to say that a one-shot survey (because it counts&#13;
households as poor even if they are below some critical MEP level only for the&#13;
reference month or year before survey) maximally estimates the welfare impact&#13;
on adults is not to play down poverty - particularly if life-cycle poverty&#13;
homes in on families just when they include two or three nutritionally&#13;
vulnerable under-fives. Policy-makers need to know how much poverty is a&#13;
transitional and life-cyclic phenomenon, not because such poverty in any sense&#13;
does not count (though standard welfare economics correctly insists that&#13;
misery shared - if survived - is revealed preferred to "the same" misery&#13;
concentrated 42/), but because different policies are likely to be&#13;
cost-effective against (i) high life-long poverty-risk for few and (ii)&#13;
poverty risk that rises sharply, for many, in particular phases of the&#13;
life-cyole. The policies for (i) and for (Ui) differ even more sharply, if&#13;
the selection, among individuals at risk, of those in fact struck by poverty&#13;
depends on contingenoies other than the life-cycle itself, such as illnesses&#13;
or bad harvests.&#13;
We revert to these policy issues in Seo. V. What evidence do we have&#13;
about the importance of life-cycles in total poverty in LICs? Most&#13;
disoussions seem to assume that cross-section measures of age of HH, as a&#13;
function of MIP (or, better, income per CU), allow us to infer the pattern of&#13;
poverty as people get older. Even leaving aside the facts that most people&#13;
are never HHs (especially in LICs, where 1 in 4 to 7 persons dies before&#13;
adulthood), and that even HHs do not all enter or leave hardship at the same&#13;
age, we have seen that such inferences are not feasible (p. 53). A much more&#13;
careful piece of inference suggests that for Colombia - a middle-income&#13;
country, for which wages were muoh the main income source - the oontribution&#13;
to inequality (and henoe, given average inoome-per-person, to poverty) made by&#13;
age-wage funotions was proportionately muoh less than in the USA, and that&#13;
made by wage differenoes within a given age-group correspondingly much more&#13;
(Schultz, 1981a, esp. pp. 12, 15).&#13;
*     * I&#13;
The hypothesis suggested by Indian village data is that lite-cycles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
are imDortant contributors to poverty to the extent that aooess to better-Daid&#13;
work or to assets is aohieved rather than asoribed.    The evidenoe is that -&#13;
in all, and only, those survey villages where people with low inoones (or in&#13;
groups, e.g. laborer oastes, likely to have low incomes) in the reference&#13;
period would maintain MEP well above monthly income-per-person - caste&#13;
"assignment" of menial work and landlessneas was relatively lax. Now why&#13;
should anybody be prepared to lend to a very poor laborer? Presumably - sinoe&#13;
"bonded labor" is seldom prevalent or enforoeable (P. Hill, 1982) - repayment&#13;
usually depends on either the borrower's oollateral or his prospects.&#13;
Collateral implies assets inherited, or accumulated (probably by non-menial&#13;
work), in the past; prospects imply a chance of more assets, or better-paid&#13;
work, in the future. Hence we should expeot lifelong poverty, refleoted in&#13;
lack of creditworthiness in bad times, to aocompany oaste (or class) rigidity&#13;
in acoess to the sources of wealth - good jobs, land. If correct, this also&#13;
implies that life-cycle poverty will tend to be less extreme even per unit of&#13;
time than lifelong poverty, beeause life-cyole poverty, being more strongly&#13;
associated with a better past or future oondition, oan be partly alleviated by&#13;
borrowing, whereas a norm that low income-per-person is lifelong undermines&#13;
the chances of that "person" to borrow, and hence to show HEP ahead of his&#13;
income.&#13;
To test this, we should juxtapose inoome and consumption expenditure&#13;
per person, in various "groups" according to inoome per person, occupation and&#13;
sooial group. Our expeotation is that the better-off will show income above&#13;
consumption expenditure; that the moderately poor (easpecially if landowners)&#13;
will show the reverse; and that the worst off seek to run down savings, or to&#13;
borrow against presumably acoumulated collateral - or future prospects to&#13;
earn and repay. To the extent that these attempts succeed, life-oycle faotors&#13;
are associated with - and modify the impaot of - their extreme ourrent&#13;
poverty: they saved out of past income, or can borrow against future&#13;
expeotations.&#13;
Unfortunately there are data problems. II/ Only one - apparently&#13;
reliable - study shows how deficita, of income below oonaumption expenditure,&#13;
are ooncentrated within the various inoome-groups. Here, 94 households (488&#13;
persons) in four Gujarat villages are placed in five groups, by (1970-1)&#13;
inoome-per-person. The poorest 18 households (100 persons), with Rs. 149 per&#13;
person, were reoorded as spending Rs. 348 per person on consumption - 2.3&#13;
times inoome: still a low enough outlay to leave them somewhat below the then&#13;
ourrent poverty line, i.e. for us to oonclude that they were at some risk of&#13;
being undernourished 44/ (V. Patel, 1973, App., p. ix, Table 4).  Only&#13;
slightly less extreme is the position of the "poor but not poorest": 210&#13;
persons (in 44 households) with average income of Rs. 283, yet average outlay&#13;
of Rs. 417. Suoh gaps, with this careful study, oannot be explained by the&#13;
usual (small) overstatements of expenditure and/or understatements of income.&#13;
Almost certainly, both groups of households are either deoumulating past&#13;
savings or stooks, or borrowing against future labor or assets. In either&#13;
case a life-cycle pattern is indioated.&#13;
Especially does this have to be the oase for the subsets within the&#13;
poverty groups upon whom, as this study shows, the deficits were heavily&#13;
concentrated. Eight of the poorest 18 households (by income-per-peroon)&#13;
somehow managed to consume about Rs. 2500 per year eaoh, over and above&#13;
recorded household income averaging about Rs. 8001 Those 8 (of 18), and 12 of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
the next-poorest 44, accounted for the total defioits of their respective&#13;
household inoome groups (V. Patel, 1973, App. Tables 4-5, pp. x-ix).&#13;
Another Gujarat study (of the 268 households, and 1533 persons, in&#13;
Ankodia village in 1960-1) shows similar large deficits. The 23 households&#13;
(81 persons) with income below Rs. 300 averaged Rs. 61.4 of income per person,&#13;
but spent on consumption Rs. 153.7 per person. The next 68 households (289&#13;
persons) averaged Rs. 112.6 of income per person yet Rs. 176.6 of outlay per&#13;
person (R. Patel, 1964, pp. 178-9). We cannot acourately identify the&#13;
per-household income ranking with a genuine poverty-ranking (Seo. IV(c)).&#13;
However, these figures are suggestive - especially as the 23 lowest-inoome&#13;
households, presumably including many of the poorest even in MEP terms, were&#13;
on average actually increasing assets-per-household significantly during the&#13;
reference year (ibid., p. 203).&#13;
Life-cycle behavior, in respect of income-expenditure gaps, may well&#13;
be closely linked to land inheritance. In the four-village study in Gujarat,&#13;
the 22 households (103 persons) subsisting mainly from "agricultural labor&#13;
without land" - though earning only Rs. 260 per person, just 60% or the&#13;
village average - were spending, on consumption, 2.4 times their annual income&#13;
(as against 1.2 times for the village as whole). Landless farm-workers,&#13;
receiving 12.7% of village income, were incurring 29.4% of village net&#13;
deficit, although they were among the poorest villagers (V. Patel, 1973, App.&#13;
Tables 1-2). Apart from the probable rarity of bonded labor (P. Hill, 1982),&#13;
unless the survey year was far below average not much of this deficit can be&#13;
explained by increases in bonded labor. Either young farm laborers - i.e.&#13;
persons with farm labor as the main source of income in 1970-1 - were&#13;
borrowing, perhaps from parents, in expectation of land inheritance; or old&#13;
ones, having passed on land to children, were living partly off past savings.&#13;
It is not plausible that "lifetime assetless" persons, whether or not in a&#13;
particular and usually landless caste, could overspend like this. But can we&#13;
find direct evidence to link life-cycle poverty, borrowing, and less&#13;
ascriptive land and job assignments?&#13;
Further light is cast on the "occupational life-cycle" and the&#13;
deficit by two further studies for Gujarat - Afawa in 1961-2 (R. Patel, 1966,&#13;
pp. 150, 157), Oon in 1963 (N. Shah, 1968, p. 164); and by two for Rajasthan -&#13;
Hasteda in 1964-5 (M. Desai, 1966, Tables IX-18 and X-2) and Dingri in 1963-4&#13;
(Saxena'and Charan, 1973, Tables VIII-18 and IX-2). One village reported a&#13;
slight overall surplus of income over consumption (Oon, 1.1% of income) and&#13;
two reported slight overall deficits (1.1% of income for Dingri and 1.9% for&#13;
Afawa) - both probably reflecting the usual income understatement and outlay&#13;
overstatement; Hasteda's overall deficit, 8.3%, probably also indicates a bad&#13;
year. In Atawa, as expected, laborers (156 households, 649 persons) as a&#13;
whole - averaging only 40% of village outlay-per-person, and all belonging to&#13;
"ex-untouchable" oastes - could not incur deficits, and indeed reported&#13;
oonsumption about 20% below their miserable incomes (B. Patel, 1966, p. 97 and&#13;
Table I-2). In Dingri, though with less inequality, the (proportionately&#13;
fewer) laborers also showed a slight surplus, i.e. appear to have been unable&#13;
to borrow; once again, all the 20 laboring households (and only one of the 66&#13;
village households engaged in other occupations) belonged to the scheduled&#13;
imas oaste (Saxena and Charan, 1973, p. 30). Oon performed similarly: of the&#13;
village's 189 households, the 65 laboring families (336 out of 1139 persons)&#13;
consumed 4-5% below income, and were heavily ooncentrated among scheduled&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
oastes, soheduled tribos, and non-Hindus. In Hasteda, however, the situation&#13;
in the tour grouped villages (p. 55) recurs: the laborer households are&#13;
oonsuming 57% above their inoomes. Consistently with the hypothesis (P. 53-4)&#13;
the overlap between caste and oocupation is muoh weaker: of the 54 laborer&#13;
households (268 persons) only 15 belong to the sohoduled oastes and 2 to the&#13;
soheduled tribes, and 9 are Muslims (M. Desai, 1966, p. 19).&#13;
Even with tentative aupport from other data, these observations from&#13;
four Gujarat villages - observations relating to caste averaae income and&#13;
expenditure per household only - oannot be more than hints. However, they do&#13;
suggest that oollateral acquired from past income, or the epeootation of&#13;
future inoome from assets (usually land, or better jobs), allows very poor&#13;
workers - even if ourrently landless or near-landless - to borrow or dissave&#13;
to the extent that asset ownership (and/or type of work) is linked to&#13;
age-cohort and/or life period of a person and/or his or her parents - but not&#13;
to membership of an "unalterable" group (such as a sex or rao or caste) to&#13;
which poor persons do not belong. In effect, rigorous asoription of social&#13;
status, if it severely oonstrains asset acquisition and mobility towards&#13;
better-rewarded work, prevents the "lower" groups from following the&#13;
trajeotory correctly predloted by the "life-oycle hypothesis" on the&#13;
determinants of personal savings/inoome ratios in developed sooieties&#13;
(Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954).&#13;
People who are ascribed a poverty-linked status tend to be poor&#13;
life-long. This is partly because they are less able to adapt to "good"&#13;
phases of the life-cyole by repaying or saving or to "bad" phases by borrowing&#13;
or dissaving. Hence the life-oycle element in poverty tends to explain a&#13;
greater portion of poverty in developed than in developing sooietieo, to the&#13;
extent that the latter are more orientated to asoription and the former to&#13;
achievement (Parsons and Shils, 1951; Hoselitz, 1968, p. 425). This explains,&#13;
in part, the US-Colombian oontrast found (p. 54) by Schultz. It also means&#13;
that the lifetime incidence and impaot of poverty and inequality - while&#13;
everywhere "less" than the maximal estimates in one-off surveys (fi. 41) - are&#13;
closer to those estimates in more rigid and immobile sooieties, where the&#13;
poor are likelier to stay poor.&#13;

IV. DEMOGRAPHY AND POVERTY HMASUREIENT&#13;
(a) The ohoice-of-denominator problem&#13;
To decide whether a household is poor, and how poor it is, we ask&#13;
whether, and how far, there is a shortfall below a critical level. But in&#13;
what? Outlay (or income) 4L5/ per person, per oonsumer unit, or per household?&#13;
So far, we have assumed that the CU is the best denominator; that per-person&#13;
indicators are less good, but adequate (which is crucial, as they are much&#13;
more readily available); and that per-household indicators are almost useless.&#13;
On this assumption, we have established that several demographic indicators -&#13;
e.g. large household size (in persons and to a slightly lesser extent in&#13;
CUs), high child/adult ratios, and to a very small extent high rural&#13;
female/male ratios - are correlated with poverty.&#13;
We now have to look at this assumption about the denominator. All&#13;
the above findings could well be invalid if per-household measures best&#13;
indioated the risk of poverty. Indeed, findings about any "charaoteristics of&#13;
poverty" always depend for their foree, and often for their validity, on the&#13;
demographio denominator (outlay per what?) used to measure poverty. With&#13;
"demographio characteristios of poverty" there is a ohicken-and-egg&#13;
difficulty: we enquire, for example, whether size of household, i.e.&#13;
person/household ratio, is linked to "poverty", but per-person (or&#13;
per-household) denominators in defining poverty will push the answer in&#13;
positive (negative) directions. An approach via equivalenoe scaling&#13;
(pp. 64-6) would, if successful, avoid the problem of choosing among&#13;
denominators; however, it cannot properly allow for the needs of the "extra"&#13;
new-born child, and places demands on data that most LIC household surveys&#13;
cannot meet. Again, if we knew which of the potential denominators was most&#13;
closely correlated with some nutritional "touchstone" of ultra-poverty - e.g.&#13;
being unable, with patterns of spending typical of households of a particular&#13;
size and structure and total outlay, to meet even 80% of the average dietary&#13;
energy requirements of the ages, sexes and activity-groups represented in the&#13;
household - we could choose that denominator. However, once again, many data&#13;
sets will not provide this information.&#13;
We therefore need to ask how the ohoice of denominators should be&#13;
made. In Seotion (b) we ask if the choice really matters. Are different&#13;
persons classiired as poor on per-household, per-CU, and per-person measures?&#13;
In Section (a) we ask: under what assumptions is each denominator most&#13;
appropriate in deoiding who is poor and by how much? We then examine the main&#13;
"problem assumption": absenoe of major economies of scale in oonsumption,&#13;
whioh is assumed in rejecting per-household in favor of per-person indicators&#13;
(Seo. (d)).&#13;
(b) Choice of denominator makes a big difrerence&#13;
Outlay per person ranks persons and households very differently from&#13;
outlay per household. In ten South Asian data sets from 1968 to 1975&#13;
(Visaria, 1980, text table 2), only 14 to 28 percent of households -&#13;
containing even smaller proportions of persons, 13 to 23 percent - were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
assigned to the same deciles when ranked by per-household and per-person&#13;
oriteria.  The surveys showed that over two in three households - and&#13;
persona - normally belonged to different auintiles by NEP and by total outlayl&#13;
This great disparity between per-household and per-person rankings is&#13;
systematio, not aocidental. Big households tend to have low outlay per person&#13;
(pp. 8-11). But they also tend to have high total outlay. Hembership of high&#13;
deciles by household size, therefore, is strongly oorrelated with membership&#13;
of high MEP deoiles (Table 1) and there remains a signifioant, though muoh&#13;
weaker, oorrelation at individual household level (Botswana, Government of,&#13;
1976, pp. 99-103). In household oross-seotiona, as HEP rises, household size&#13;
rises more slowly, so that a weak positive relationship remains between a&#13;
household's deoile rank in output per person and per household (Datta and&#13;
Meerman, 1980, p. 4, fn. 2; Visaria, 1980a, p. 5, fn. 1). However, the&#13;
negative size-MEP and positive size-outlay links mean that a low-rank deoile&#13;
by household outlay oomprises a mixture of small households (some with quite&#13;
large MEP) and low-MEP households (some with many household members). Tables&#13;
10 and 11 provide examples from Kerala and N. Nigeria. Apart from Visaria's&#13;
South Asian work, several other studies show this tendency of smaller&#13;
households to have lower total household income. The link is notable in Kenya&#13;
(Collier and Lal, 1980, pp. 1, 39), Botawana (Botswana, Govt. of, 1975, pp.&#13;
99-103), and Malaya. In Malaya the result is that 38 percent of persons in the&#13;
lowest quintile of households by income-per-household were not in the lowest&#13;
quintile of households by inoome-per-person (Datta and Meerman, 1980, p. 5).&#13;
Therefore, per-household and per-person denominators seldom identify&#13;
anything remotely like the "same" people or households as poor. In defining&#13;
poverty-lines, too, we would classify very different Droportions of households&#13;
and persons as poor, with very different average intensities (and Sen indexes)&#13;
of poverty, acoording to whether per-household or per-person outlay were used.&#13;
a     *     0&#13;
We are trying to answer the question: in what sort of households,&#13;
plaeos, occupations, eto. is poverty most severe? That is, where are the&#13;
proportions of persons below a poverty (or ultra-poverty) line greatest, and&#13;
where do they fall furthest behind such a level? Many studies present only&#13;
per-household outlay (or income), and can at best assess "adequaoy of MEP" by&#13;
estimating whether suoh outlays would suffioe to maintain a given MEP for a&#13;
household of average size and oomposition; this will be a bad assessment,&#13;
since households with low MEP, low calories-per-CU, high ohild/adult ration,&#13;
high IMR, etc., tend to show MHS and child/adult ratios. well above national or&#13;
local averages. As we saw, rankings of households by outlay-per-household&#13;
overlap very badly with rankings of households by outlay-per-CU.&#13;
Fortunately, a big minority of surveys does report households, or at&#13;
least ranked groups of households, by Der-Person outlay or inoome. Only&#13;
rarely, however, do they report per-CU data, or give household composition&#13;
sufficiently disaggregated to permit households ranked by per-person outlay to&#13;
be re-ranked by per-CU outlays. It therefore becomes important to estimate&#13;
how muoh better or worse at indioating the risk of poverty, under various&#13;
circumstances, per-CU indicators are than per-person indioators (Seo.(o)).&#13;
First, however, we can report that the count of households that are poor (or&#13;
their ranking in order of poverty-risk) by MEP is not an intolerably bad guide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60&#13;
to the count (or ranking) by outlay-per-CU. It is bad enough to lead to some&#13;
risk of error, but - unlike outlay-per-household as a guide to&#13;
outlay-per-person - not so bad as to invalidate most inferences for groups&#13;
from "poverty" on one criterion to "poverty" on the other.&#13;
In each of Visaria's ten South Asian surveys, for example, household&#13;
size could be calculated (i) in persons and (ii) in Indian-weighted 46/&#13;
adult-equivalents. Among surveys, the range of rils is small - 0.96 to 0.98&#13;
(Visaria, 1980, p. 201) - but all are very persuasive. In India, even among&#13;
quite fine MEP groups, the ratio of CUs to persons in the average household&#13;
(in a 1971-2 sample of 11,468 rural and 19,459 urban Indian households) -&#13;
while tending to rise with MEP - varied extremely little: it averaged 0.788&#13;
among the poorest 3.9% of rural households, 0.794 for the next-poorest 10.5%,&#13;
0.793 (7.1%), 0.791 (10.2%), 0.797 (15.2%) ... 0.807 (best-off 4.2%); and in&#13;
urban areas 0.790 (poorest 0.9%), 0.787 (next-poorest 3.7%), 0.793 (3.6%),&#13;
0.796 (6.0%), 0.800 (10.2%) ... 0.840 (best-off 17.0%) (Rao, 1979, p. 117).&#13;
So it is not surprising that - in South Asian large-sample surveys in 1968-75&#13;
- in sharp contrast to the mere 26-40% of households (25-38% of persons)&#13;
assigned to the same quintile of households when these were ranked (i) by MEP&#13;
and (ii) by household-outlay rankings - 77-86% of households (78-87% of&#13;
persons) were in the same quintile of households, when these were ranked (i)&#13;
by MEP and (ii) by outlay-per-CU on Indian weights (Visaria, 1980,&#13;
pp. 39, 46.)&#13;
It is tempting to conclude, as similar Nigerian and other micro-data&#13;
suggest, that "to give all persons equal weight regardless of age and sex does&#13;
not produce too much distortion" (Simmons, 1976, pp. 26-7). And certainly&#13;
distribution "using ... per capita income probably will be very similar to the&#13;
distribution when using ... income per [CUJ" Datta and Meerman, 1980, pi 7).&#13;
However - even if, across individual households, 47/ we find (i) high r&#13;
between size in persons and size in CUs, (ii) high ri between outlay per&#13;
person and outlay per CU, (iii) similar summary statistics (e.g. Gini&#13;
coefficients) of distribution whether we measure outlay per person or per CU -&#13;
we cannot be confident that, when two sets of households (e.g. in two areas)&#13;
are compared, the estimate of numbers in poverty will be almost the same&#13;
whether per-CU or per-person indioators are used. After all, if "58-74% of&#13;
the households (including 61-76% of the population) fall into the identical&#13;
decile" on both indioators in a group of surveys (Visaria, 1980a, p. 12), then&#13;
26-42% of households fall into different deciles. We know little about the&#13;
distribution of the latter households between rich and poor, big and small, or&#13;
country and city. They might well be concentrated among the poor. 48/&#13;
If outlay, in a household, is below a level producing poverty for a&#13;
household of "typical" size, that provides almost no evidence that&#13;
outlay-per-person in that household is below the poverty line.&#13;
Outlay-per-person in a household (of unknown CU/person ratio) is a muoh better&#13;
guide to its outlay-per-CU - though still far from perfect - than is total&#13;
outlay, in a household of unknown size, to outlay-per-person.&#13;
Finally, total household outlay probably ranks households (of unknown&#13;
size and CUs) somewhat less badly by outlay-per-CU than by outlay-per-person.&#13;
This is because households with big total outlay, while clearly larger, tend&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
also to have slightly higher child/adult ratios. The latter tendency,&#13;
however, is quite insufficient to "rescue" household outlay as a poverty&#13;
measure, if we believe that per-CU measures are the best but are not available&#13;
in a particular case. Outlay-per-household ranks households slightly less&#13;
badly in order of outlay-per-CU than in order of outlay-per-person; but&#13;
outlay-per-person remains likely to rank them muoh more closely to their&#13;
outlay-per-CU order than total household outlay would do. Per-person and&#13;
per-CU are not too dissimilar; per-household is totally different.&#13;
(c) The case for and against the three measures&#13;
So far, we have said little about whether inadequacy of per-person&#13;
or per-household resources best indicates "poverty". All that has been shown&#13;
is that the two indioators produce completely different results. It is a&#13;
defensible rule of thumb, in LICs with more or less typical income&#13;
distribution, that at most the poorest 20 percent or so of households are&#13;
ultra-poor - likely in normal years to be unable, at some time, to afford the&#13;
minimum dietary energy intake required for good health (for a summary of the&#13;
evidence see Lipton, 1983). Between four and seven in ten households assigned&#13;
to the "poorest quintile" by income (or outlay) per household are not so&#13;
assigned on a per-person basis in LICs; and between four and seven in ten&#13;
households in poverty by income (or outlay) per person are not so on a&#13;
per-household basis.&#13;
It may seem self-evident that per-person indicators are better&#13;
measures of poverty, or economio welfare, than per-household indicators.&#13;
However, African "poverty datum lines" are often specified as the wage&#13;
required to support an average household. Also, clearly competent research by&#13;
individuals (e.g. Ahmed, 1981; Nugent and Tarawneh, 1982), governments (e.g.&#13;
Government of Botawana, 1975) and international organisations (e.g. Mathew and&#13;
Scott, 1980) persistently uses per-household resouroe indicators to establish&#13;
whether a household is poor. Sometimes the reasons are administrative, or are&#13;
based on laok of information about household size in different inoome-groups.&#13;
Often, however, researchers and their organisations staunchly defend the use&#13;
of per-household indicators of poverty. It is correctly asserted, for&#13;
example, that resouroe allooations are usually to the household (or fungible&#13;
inside it); Al/ that it allooates internally in ways little amenable to&#13;
policy; and that these internal allocations, notably of food, are not&#13;
necessarily optimal. None of these assertions, however, justifies using&#13;
outlay-per-household as an indioator of poverty in preference to per-person&#13;
indicators. The case for preferring these (e.g. Datta and Meerman, 1980)&#13;
seems overwhelmingly strong, and the attempt to isolate "characteristios of&#13;
poverty" linked to per-household indicators of the latter (e.g. Collier and&#13;
Lal, 1980, pp. 38-9, 46; A4-6) appears rather risky and sometimes misleading.&#13;
Only under two circumstances might per-household indicators be best.&#13;
First, due to the importance in household incomes of the yield from jointly&#13;
consumable owned assets (car, furniture, eto.) - assets having aome of the&#13;
characteristics of "public goods" with all members of just one household as&#13;
the public - or for other reasons, eoonomies of soale in oonsumDtion could be&#13;
very large. If five oan live as cheaply as three, and can enjoy flows of&#13;
services that generate the same levels of welfare, then it is wrong to assess&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62&#13;
welfare by dividing household outlay by five for the family of five and by&#13;
three for the family of three. These effeots are examined in Seo. (d), but&#13;
there is some a Driori ground for doubt that, for a poor household in a LIC,&#13;
they are very important. First, such a household spends 70-80% of outlay&#13;
upon simple foods, for which scale-economies (while extant, in buying and&#13;
cooking) are small. Second, if they were important, poor people - being&#13;
likelier than wealthy ones to prefer income to privacy - would presumably&#13;
reveal suoh preferences, and thus internalize the potential scale-economieat&#13;
through a much higher propensity to live in more complex households than is&#13;
shown by wealthy people. We know (Seo. II(h)) that is not the case.&#13;
The second circumstance, under which outlay-per-household is a better&#13;
guide to poverty-risk than outlay-per-person, is more plausible. We have seen&#13;
that households with low NEP tend to be bigger than households with high pEP,&#13;
but also to have higher child/adult ratios (Tables 2, 8). Suppose that&#13;
low-NEP households - e.g. because they tended espeoially to have very small&#13;
children - were hardly bigger in CUs than high-MNS households. Suppose also&#13;
that outlay-per-CU is accepted as the most reliable indicator of a household's&#13;
poverty, but is seldom available by per-person (or per-household) outlay&#13;
classes. Then outlay-per-household might well rank households, in respect of&#13;
welfare, in an order much closer than outlay-per-person to their "correct"&#13;
ranking by outlay-per-CU. For example, suppose household A contains 8 persons&#13;
and 5 CUs, and has $10 NEPF; B contains 6 persons and 6 CUs, and has $12 MEP.&#13;
A's household outlay is $80, and B's $72; A's outlay per CU is $16, and B's&#13;
$12. Then household outlay ranks A as richer than B, which is in accord with&#13;
outlay-per-CU ranking; but NEP "wrongly" tells us B is richer than A. In&#13;
practice, though lower-NEP households such as A do tend to have a somewhat&#13;
higher persons/CUs ratio than higher-MEP (and generally smaller) households&#13;
such as B - so that the correction in the example is in the right direction -&#13;
the amount of the correction is much smaller, as the data on p. 60 suggested.&#13;
It is in fact far too small to render significant numbers of households,&#13;
better-off than others on NEP rankings yet not on per-household rankings,&#13;
worse-off on outlay-per-CU rankings, so that households could be better ranked&#13;
by outlay per household than by NEP. In general, we find a CU/person ratio&#13;
decreasing only very slowly as NEP declines.&#13;
These two effects, scale-economies in consumption and ranking&#13;
disparities as between NEP and outlay per CU, are of course additive in their&#13;
tendency to make household outlay a less bad poverty indicator, relative to&#13;
NIP, than it might at first appear. However, even together, the two effects&#13;
appear to be each so small, in the overwhelming majority of cases, as not to&#13;
invalidate the comonsense conclusion. Normally, SEP appears to be very muoh&#13;
better than household outlay as a poverty indioator. Indeed, the latter is&#13;
almost worthless, unless the importance of scale-economies can be shown in&#13;
Sec. (d) to be established, after all, by recent evidence.&#13;
*     0     a&#13;
Despite the above reassurances, it is easy to simulate conditions&#13;
where NEP is a bad proxy, as a poverty-ranking device, for outlay per CU.&#13;
Unfortunately, there is no universal way to weight males and females of&#13;
different ages, in respect either of total "requirements" to attain a given&#13;
level of health or performance, or of the "welfare" that each person would&#13;
attain from a given income or outlay. Such weights could be different at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63&#13;
different levels, of household inoome-per-person (or per-CU) and fasily size,&#13;
and in different cultural environments; this underlies the attempt to devise&#13;
constant  "equivalenoe soales" (pp. 64-5). Also, even if we could show that a&#13;
man or 40 in a particular oase needed 1.3 times the outlay of a ohild of 10 to&#13;
obtain the same welfare, there is no guarantee that intra-houwehold allocation&#13;
would produce that ratio - or approximate it to the same extent in groups of&#13;
households being compared.&#13;
To some extent, however, all this oan be short-circuited in the oase&#13;
of poor, or potentially poor, people in LICs. For example, in India in&#13;
1972-3, the 32 peroent of urban households, and the 76 percent of rural&#13;
households, with lower levels of ME? - i.e. all MEP sub-groups up to 43-55&#13;
Rs./month - were, in each (often quite small) MEP sub-group, spending over&#13;
three-quarters of MEP on food (Sarvekshana, Jan. 1979, pp. s354, 8423).&#13;
Such concentration of outlay on food is almost always found among&#13;
those who are ultra-, moderately, or even potentially poor. Among the&#13;
three-quarters of Indian villagers - (and the one-third of townspeople) - with&#13;
lower MEP, this food/outlay ratio is not only very high (75-80S), but falls&#13;
only very slowly with rising MEP (and not at all for the poorest 10-15% or&#13;
households). Also, all these groups spend the bulk of food outlay on oheap&#13;
calories; and calories (dietary energy) "per unit" are usually the only&#13;
requirement both at risk of serious deficiency and related in intake mainly to&#13;
private inoome and outlay (see Lipton, 1983, for evidenoe for all the above).&#13;
Therefore, oan we not establish the average oalorio requirements of males and&#13;
females in different age-groups; use these to construct CU-equivalents for&#13;
households of different total outlays; and - for the potentially poor -&#13;
oonvert outlay to outlay-per-CU upon oalorie-based CU-weights? Suoh weights&#13;
are widely available, and are used in Lusk, Indian and Taiwanese CUs. These&#13;
three produce somewhat different poverty measures, but all appear to adjust&#13;
crude MEP data in the "right" direction (see ftn. 46).&#13;
What these adjustments suggest is that - because child/adult ratios&#13;
rise quite sharply as MEP falls - low-ME? households tend to have relatively&#13;
less inadequate outlay-per-CU, so that the inoidenoe and severity of poverty&#13;
are less than they appear to be (although for various reasons the adjustments&#13;
are very small). While this reduction may be ensible from other oontexts&#13;
(see, for example, Srinivasan, 1980), the inferenoe from CUs and&#13;
MP-ohild/adult relationships is not quite so olear. First, the inferenoe is&#13;
actually strengthened by the faot that food/outlay ratios tend to rise not&#13;
only with falling MEP but also (given MEP) with rising child/adult ratios&#13;
(Deaton and Muellbauer, 1983), so that food requirements beoome better&#13;
indioators among the poor than among total populations of a household's total&#13;
"welfare size". Seoond, however, this very faot of a greater food/outlay&#13;
ratio in households - together with the muoh greater risk of damage for&#13;
children under five from a given proportionate shortfall behind dietary&#13;
energy requirements - means that an 1% shortfall in outlay-per-CU does more&#13;
damage to very poor households than to others. This, in turn, suggests that -&#13;
even if "ME? below a given level" may somewhat overstate the incidence and&#13;
severity of calorio risk - correction to per-CU indioators correspondingly&#13;
understates them. Third, in parts of Bangladesh and North India (though&#13;
probably not elsewhere), and in areas where women's prospeots in labor markets&#13;
are partiolarly bad oompared to men's (Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1980),&#13;
ultra-poor families in partioular (Carloni, 1981, oiting Levinson) appear to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64&#13;
be driven to discriminate against small girls - not other age-groups (Chen et&#13;
al., 1981), nor boys - by selective underfeeding. This, onoe again, suggests&#13;
that the move from MEP to outlay-per-CU "over-deflates" the requirements of&#13;
the very poor.&#13;
It follows that, when we ask "Has Area A more, or severer, poverty&#13;
than Area B?", or "Does Project X benefit the poor more, or less, than Project&#13;
Y?"p - we take an implicit decision by using per-person rather than per-CU&#13;
measures. The decision is to weight low purchasing-power more highly in&#13;
households with lower CUtMEP ratios, i.e., in general, with more small&#13;
children per adult. Since it is in such households that poverty is likeliest&#13;
to disable or to kill, this decision seems sensible in policy-making to reduce&#13;
poverty by cost-effective alloeative decisions among projects or regions. (It&#13;
would not be sensible in making individual clinical or diaxnostic decisions&#13;
about which particular household or person needs what and why; but no&#13;
economist (indeed no sane person, surely) would make individual decisions on&#13;
the sole basis of grouped survey data about outlays, incomes and&#13;
populations. 50/) We can be the more confident in using HEP data ranking in&#13;
broad allocations, because the overlap, for relevant decisions, with per-CU&#13;
data rankings is very close (p. 59); and because tolerably reliable data are&#13;
more seldom available per-CU than per-person.&#13;
There remains the question: should both per-person and per-CU data&#13;
for outlay be replaced, as indicators of incidence and severity of poverty, by&#13;
appropriate equivalence seales? These, if they could be constructed and if the&#13;
relevant data were available at acceptable cost, would also take care of the&#13;
problems of economies of scale in consumption (Sec. (d)). A deliberately&#13;
loose statement would be that equivalence scales show the level of outlay (or&#13;
income) that households of various sizes and compositions require in order to&#13;
be on the same indifference surface. If we could then associate a particular&#13;
ranked indifference surface, for each size and composition of household, with&#13;
(i) poverty and (ii) a level of total household outlay (or income), we could&#13;
then count the households and persons in poverty in a given area, or moved&#13;
into or out of poverty by a particular project. 51/&#13;
Unfortunately, the steps needed to tighten up the above "deliberately&#13;
loose statement" - while still leaving equivalence scales important for some&#13;
purposes - remove much of their apparent potential usefulness as indicators of&#13;
numbers of persons in need. First, some people would deny the possibility of&#13;
comparing the impact of extra income on welfare among even broad groups of&#13;
different persons; but this extreme position - apart from removing the point&#13;
from almost all arguments about the projects, areas, etc. on which a&#13;
cost-effective attack on poverty "ought" to concentrate - is surely&#13;
pseudo-sophisticated and even a little silly. 52/ Second and much more&#13;
plausibly, one can object to any attempt to compare the welfare - total,&#13;
marginal with respect to extra income, or whatever - of groups of persons with&#13;
distinct demographic structures: of, for example, childless couples and&#13;
couples with three children. The only oredible solution 53/ is to ask: what&#13;
extra annual outlay does a "representative" couple require, at a given time,&#13;
to compensate it for the outlay foregone by meeting, at the level choosen by&#13;
that couDle, the extra requirements of one, two ... children in various&#13;
age-groups (or by divorcing into two one-member households; by taking an old,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65&#13;
incomeless person into the household; etc.)? The answers to these questions&#13;
imply - if we assume that the oapacity for enjoyment, the "rights" to&#13;
enjoyment, and the impaot on incentives of enjoyment are, among members of any&#13;
set of demographically identioal households, statistioally independent of&#13;
outlay - quite strong conclusions. In partioular, we could then isolate a&#13;
level of outlay just sufficient to avoid *poverty" or "ultra-poverty" for&#13;
(say) a couple with one ohild aged five, and work out welfare-equivalent&#13;
outlay levels for all other sizes 54/ and age- and sex-structures of&#13;
household.&#13;
How to do this - and the surprising faot that maintenance of&#13;
parental acoess to "adult goods" (mainly non-food), not the Engelian oriterion&#13;
of a constant food share, is the most plausible indioator of welfare&#13;
equivalenoe - has been explained very clearly elsewhere (Deaton and&#13;
Muellbauer, 1983, esp. pp. 24-5). However, the method, even if data were&#13;
oostless, seems unsuitable for our purposes. In order to oompare like with&#13;
like (and to focus upon the indifferenoe surfaces of the decision-takers), we&#13;
were logioally compelled to ask what extra outlay a couple needed to&#13;
compensate it for welfare foregone by "adding", say, an infant to the family.&#13;
Leaving aside some important conceptual issues - the time-stream of benefits&#13;
to the couple from such an "addition"; the question of whether the couple&#13;
would be compensated or merely given a windfall, if now "reimbursed" the&#13;
streams of benefits deliberately sacrificed, through a decision to have more&#13;
children, for expected benefits later; the possibility (Schultz, 1981) that&#13;
the couple is making something like a (constrained) optimizing&#13;
demographic-economic life-plan - there remains, at the "simpler" level of&#13;
poverty planning, a more peremptory objection to any attempt to use&#13;
equivalence scales as an indicator of how many households in Area A, or&#13;
benefiting from Project X, are poor.&#13;
This objection is that, although the most serious sufferers from&#13;
poverty are children under five - who in extreme oases suffer&#13;
nutrition-induoed mental or physioal damage, or even die - the logioal&#13;
requirements of equivalence scaling oompel us totally to disregard these&#13;
ohildren's level of well-being in deoiding how many households fall below a&#13;
given level of "welfare" (ranked indifference surfaoe). "Perhaps this is&#13;
unfortunate, because for many polioy purposes we are interested in the welfare&#13;
of the children themselves. However, [equivalence scales] cannot be direotly&#13;
interpreted in terms of children's welfare, although it would olearly be&#13;
possible to add supplementary assumptions linking parental oosts to the&#13;
welfare of their ohildren" (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1983, pp. 8-9). Even such&#13;
assumptions could not dispose of the problem that under-fives cannot reveal&#13;
their preferences by their deoisions as purohasers.&#13;
The results from logioally aoceptable (Rothbarth-Barten) equivalence&#13;
soales produce ohild-weights somewhat, but not dramatioally, below those of&#13;
Lusk  CUs.  In such soales, "child costs oome out to be 30-40% of an adult"&#13;
(ibid., p. 39); Lusk CUs are 0.3 of an adult male for children aged 0-1, 0.4&#13;
at 13, 0.5 at 4-6, 0.7 at 7-9, and 0.8 at 0-12. The Indian weights (Visaria,&#13;
1980, p. 200) would leave the average child aged under 12 about halfway&#13;
between the Lusk and Rothbarth-Barten levels. Lusk and Indian weights also&#13;
handle, as equivalence scales do not, the problem of adult women's&#13;
"requirements" vis-a-vis men; but the soales oan deal with, and CUs ignore,&#13;
economies of scale in consumption. Despite the advantages of Rothbarth-Barten&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66&#13;
procedures here, however, and despite their logieal (and in other contexts&#13;
empirical) merits, they seem to be unhelpful for LIC poverty measurement - and&#13;
for allocations aimed at cost-effective poverty reduction - above all because&#13;
their great advantage, logical rigor, implies the neglect of children's&#13;
welfare. We thus need to look at economies of scale in consumption directly.&#13;
How important are they? Could they mean that, although Area A or Project x&#13;
looks much more oost-effeotive as a way of reducing poverty, the bigger&#13;
households benefiting are in fact less poor than they seem - and the amall,&#13;
poorer - so that more would be achieved in Area B or by Project Y?&#13;
(d) Economies of scale in oonsumDtion&#13;
An important analysis of a sample of 13,000 US households in 1970-71&#13;
(Lazear and Miohael, 1980) uses standard assumptions about optimizing consumer&#13;
behavior to estimate how much must be spent on purchase commodities, by&#13;
households of different sizes and structures, to generate a given flow of&#13;
benefits-Der-Derson - say, that obtained from *10,000 annual outlay by a&#13;
single person - from the services derived from purchased commodities (a flow&#13;
hereafter called "eofare"). 55/ As household size and composition vary, so do&#13;
purchases of all types of commodities.  Hence Lazear and Michael use&#13;
cross-sectional variations in expenditures, as household size and composition&#13;
vary - plus independent estimates of "price elasticities - to infer changes in&#13;
prices ... from which real (price deflated) levels of income can be inferred"&#13;
for households with similar nominal income, but different size and composition&#13;
(ibid., pp. 96, 104).&#13;
In three main ways (ibid., pp. 92-3) larger households might get more&#13;
welfare-per-person from a particular level of outlay-per-person. One is via&#13;
family goods: "If $5 provides the man with a securely looked door and $5&#13;
provides the woman with the same ... then together its price [becomes] $2.50"&#13;
to each when they form a joint household. A second is standard&#13;
scale-economies, such as quantity discounts. A third is complementarity due&#13;
to specialization within the household.&#13;
The total effect of these three economies of scale in consumption&#13;
(ESCs), at least in the USA, is astonishingly large. Each adult in a&#13;
two-adult-household can enjoy, for $10,606, the same eofare as a single-person&#13;
household enjoys for 10,000: i.e. "on average the prices of service flow&#13;
units faced by couples are ... only 53 per cent ... as high as the prices&#13;
faced by single-parent households" (ibid., p. 99). In other words, if two&#13;
live as cheaply as one, they enjoy not 50% but over 94S of the level of living&#13;
of "one"l A household of two adults and one child require to spend $13,342 to&#13;
enjoy the same eofare per person that three single-adult households would get&#13;
for $10,000 each: five of the latter ("costing" $50,000) would enjoy the same&#13;
ecfare as one household with two adults and three children spending only&#13;
$16,889. In other words, a nominal post-tax dollar appears to generate almost&#13;
twice as much ecfare, at these outlay levels, for a childless couple as for a&#13;
single person - and almost thrice as much for a couple with three children as&#13;
for a single person (ibid., p. 97).&#13;
Three other expert estimates of ESCJ for the USA are cited by Lazear&#13;
and Hichael. They use different methods, but do not reach radically different&#13;
results. Moreover, the higher levels of consumption-flows in larger US&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67&#13;
households are not significantly offeet, in their effects on faully welfare,&#13;
by higher doeastio work-inputs; only a small part of the greater&#13;
"eofare-cost-erfeotiveness" of outlay in bigger households is traceable to&#13;
"speoialization within the household" by labor, and the effeot of eztra&#13;
domestic labor by tamtly members, suoh as the wife, appears as a proportion of&#13;
this small amount (ibid., p. 102).&#13;
Even for the USA, we do not yet know how these massive ESCa might&#13;
operate differentially for households of similar numbers and ohild/adult&#13;
ratios, but different age- and sez-oompositions. Nor need these results&#13;
reduce the proportion of households below a Opoverty line". Howver, if these&#13;
results carried over to LICs, the Impact on all existing analyses of the&#13;
incidence of poverty in different tiDes of household - and hence in different&#13;
regions, among sets of persons beneriting from alternative projects, eto. -&#13;
would be devastating. Sufferers from poverty would then appoar to be muoh&#13;
more oonoentrated in smaller households, Implying that anti-poverty strategies&#13;
should redireot polioy and projeot benefits towards such households. This&#13;
requirement of equity would clash with the requirement of efficiency if - as&#13;
would surely be likely - signifioant parts of these average ESCa oontinued to&#13;
apply to marginal outlays in bigger households, whioh however were now to lose&#13;
some benefits from anti-poverty polioy to smaller households, preclsely&#13;
because the latter were now counted as relatively "poorer" because less&#13;
eotare-efficient.&#13;
However, independent features of LIC data sets suggest that ESCs are&#13;
muoh leas important - especially for low-ME groups - than in the USA. First,&#13;
in LICs, espeoially among such groups, as the number of siblings rises, their&#13;
proportionate death-risks rise (Birdsall, 1977, p. 75) muoh more sharply than&#13;
in developed countries, and upon a higher (one-ohild family) base-level.&#13;
Moreover, both high IHR (and ohild mortality) at low MEPs, and its tendenoy to&#13;
increase with sibling numbers, are muoh more directly attributable in LICs&#13;
than in the USA to "primary" poverty In Rowntree's sense: i.e. not due to&#13;
household decisions to allooate resouroes away from basic foods, medicine,&#13;
shelter, eto., but due to absolute lack of resources, per poor child, to&#13;
combat undernutrition, infection, eto. This stark evidenoe of the effeot of&#13;
low private MEP, as MNS rises, in poor LIC families militates against major&#13;
ESCa for them. 56/&#13;
Seoond, the structure of outlay is much less favorable to ESCs in&#13;
such families. Lazear and Miohael (ibid., p. 97) usefully indioate the types&#13;
of comodity purchase for whioh, on their revealed-preference approaoh, the&#13;
larger US household is espeoially efficient - compared to the smaller&#13;
household - in tranasorming eaoh dollar of outlay into eofare. For example,&#13;
overall eofare per dollar is about twice as high for a three-ohild couple as&#13;
for a ohildless oouple - but 28% for shelter, 84% for food, 187% for clothing,&#13;
191% for transport, 184% for other goods, and 85% for other services. Much of&#13;
the 84% on food is due to lower per-person costa when a larger party eats out.&#13;
Food not eaten out (which oomprises 70-80% of total outlay for poor people in&#13;
LICa, but - even for those olassified as "poorw --well below 35% in the USA)&#13;
does offer some ESCJ in purohasing and preparation, but not very substantial&#13;
ones. 57/&#13;
The methodology of US studies, too, could lead us to expect too muoh&#13;
of ESCs for poor people. The figures on p. 66, while given to a norm of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68&#13;
$10,000 yearly for a one-person household, in fact refer to the relative&#13;
puchasing-power of total, or average, outlays for households of eaoh size and&#13;
adult-child ratio (Lazear and Niohael, 1980, p. 99). In the USA, and even&#13;
more in LICs, there are a priori reasons to expeot poorer groups to show much&#13;
lower ESCs, as indicated above. Nor is it clear whether similar ESCs should&#13;
be expected whenever a household of given size and composition adds a member,&#13;
whether young or old, male or female; and whether urban or rural.&#13;
The lower incidence of the decision to live in complex households in&#13;
LICs among the poor (Sea. II(h)), despite their presumably greater pressures&#13;
towards the welfare optimization assumed by Lazear-Michael methods, might have&#13;
at least two interpretations. It could be that ESCs there are in fact very&#13;
amall. Alternatively, as argued on p. 32, a poor couple might have too&#13;
little heritable eapital to induce married children to stay at home, even&#13;
though if they did so there would be a larger stream of services, from&#13;
eoonomic oommodities, to parent and offspring couples taken together.&#13;
Equivalence-scales - apart from their major claims upon data - have&#13;
basic drawbacks in assessing incidence or severity of poverty, especially if&#13;
the main victims of poverty are children. Outlay-per-CU - for which&#13;
outlay-per-person is a surprisingly good proxy, as regards poverty incidence&#13;
and severity in large groups of households - has therefore to be used. In&#13;
developed countries, however, scale-economies in consumption (at least for&#13;
households around mean outlay-per-CU) may well be so great that an&#13;
outlay-per-CU measure would lead to serious over-estimation of the relative&#13;
poverty in big households, and serious under-estimation of it in small ones.&#13;
Such scale-economies are probably much less significant for the&#13;
typical poor household in a typical LIC. However, this last statement, in&#13;
considering the impact of an extra person on a poor LIC household, averages&#13;
far too many distinct circumstances, even holding outlay-per-CU constant -&#13;
urban and rural, big and small households, extra child and adult members, etc.&#13;
For instance, in India, low-MEP households' MHS is much bigger in towns than&#13;
other households' MHS; in rural areas, the disparity is a good deal smaller&#13;
(Table 2). The possible implications - that there is a higher ratio of urban&#13;
to rural ESCs for poor than for other households; and that rural poverty is&#13;
severer, relative to urban, than MEP-based comparisons would suggest - seem&#13;
striking, but depend on absent information about urban and rural ESCs.&#13;
The large apparent size of ESCs for the mean US household, in any&#13;
oase, adds research and policy urgency to an improved understanding of ESCs&#13;
for the LIC household. They could be much smaller in the latter, yet still&#13;
could importantly refocus anti-poverty activities upon - for example -&#13;
non-married women, especially where they have difficulty in remarrying or&#13;
working outside the home, or where long-term male migration prevails.&#13;
However, we are now unoomfortably ill-informed about the importance and&#13;
location of soale-economies for poor LIC households in various circumstances.&#13;
We return to research and policy implications in Sec. V.&#13;

V. DEKOGRAPHY. POVERTY AND POLICY&#13;
(a) Policy for researoh, measurement and Drojeot planning&#13;
Many of the oonclusions we have advanced in this paper are highly&#13;
tentative. It is organised, first, around the oorrelates of differences among&#13;
poverty-groups in MHS; as such, this topic appears to be largely unresearched&#13;
in today's LICs, so that we have sought, in part, to assess the applioability&#13;
there of findings from historioal demography in NDCs. The other central isaue&#13;
considered here, the relationship of poverty to age- and sex-structure, is&#13;
only beginning to yield generalizations, partly because that relationship has&#13;
in the past been too readily assumed to be culturally so specific that they&#13;
are impossible. This paper also limits its immediate policy applioations by&#13;
seeking merely the demographic oorrelates of poverty, rather than, as yet, the&#13;
direction of causes and effects. Nevertheless, a few policy suggestions&#13;
emerge.&#13;
The greatest oonfidenoe attaches to suggestions about polioy for&#13;
research, measurement, and project preparation. Perhaps half the&#13;
quantitatively based "findings" about poverty, and oertainly over&#13;
three-quarters of the wrong ones, are still based on surveys that - openly or&#13;
otherwise 58/ - rank households by "poverty" in order of their total income or&#13;
outlay. Yet most households in, say, the lowest quintile by total household&#13;
income are not in the lowest quintile by outlay-per-person; and the&#13;
oommonsense observation, that per-person or per-CU outlay is a far better&#13;
guide to poverty than per-household outlay, is fully borne out by all the&#13;
evidence. Low MEP is strongly linked to high MRS in total populations; so,&#13;
only slightly less, is low outlay-per-CU, despite the clear tendency, for&#13;
low-MEP (and for big) households to feature high child/adult ratios. Our&#13;
first policy conclusion - already implicit in Datta and Meerman (1980) - is&#13;
that poverty lines, surveys, research, evaluations of the poverty impaot of&#13;
policies (or projeots or tax systems), and project planning should never&#13;
accept that numbers, or distances from a poverty line, of households with low&#13;
total outlay (or income) are a remotely tolerable proxy for the inoidence, or&#13;
severity of poverty in, poor households.&#13;
Second, MEP is, for all its over-simplifioations, a surprisingly&#13;
acoeptable guide to poverty. If seasonally averaged in a typioal year, and&#13;
adjusted for price differences that may be faced by different groups, NEP&#13;
does seem to rank xroups of households reasonably acourately. Consider two&#13;
equally populous regions where 80% of households have MEP sufficient to&#13;
command adequate diets.  The region where the lowest-MEP 20% of households are&#13;
5% below an MEP sufficient (on normal spending patterns) to provide even 80%&#13;
of average 59/ dietary energy requirements to those households is normally&#13;
poorer than the region where 10% of households are 5% below that MBE, and the&#13;
10% with next-lowest MEP oan afford 80-100% of those requirements. Projeots&#13;
benefiting the poorest 20% in the former region, given their&#13;
oost-effectiveness, normally reduce both the inoidenoe and the severity of&#13;
poverty more than in the latter region.&#13;
Third, it is not certain that we oan find a better measure than MEP&#13;
to assess a household's risk of poverty. Equivalenoe scales make aevere&#13;
claims on data, cannot measure ohild poverty, and have other disadvantages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70&#13;
Outlay-per-CU, on the other hand, superficially appears to be elearly superior&#13;
to MEP in 'locating" areas, projecto, etc. especially important in polclies&#13;
against absolute poverty; but is it? Where infant and child mortality is&#13;
especially high, the apparent advantages of outlay-per-CU might seem&#13;
especially big; for such high mortality conoentrates in the lowest-MEP&#13;
households - as do infants and small ohildren with relatively low requirements&#13;
and hence CU-weighting. - thus somewhat (though surprisingly little: p. 60)&#13;
reducing CU/person ratios. Yet it is precisely in such ciroumstanoes that we&#13;
would be most reluctant to adopt a weighting that relocated 'poverty", and&#13;
thus social outlay to reduce it, in households with higher adult/ohild and&#13;
therefore CU/person ratios; suoh reweighting would make adults less unhappy,&#13;
but oause permanent harm, even death, for under-fives. The imDaot of a given&#13;
shortfall of outlay behind 'requirements", especially if that shortfall means&#13;
ultra-poverty, is greater in households where those ratios are low - although&#13;
the size of the shortfall, given MEP, is greater where the ratios are high.&#13;
We are conoerned with impact as well as size. So NEP may well be a more&#13;
aoeptable poverty indioator than outlay-per-CU. Fortunately, the choice&#13;
between per-C and per-person measures seldom greatly alters poverty rankings&#13;
of major groups of households, or of big projeots.&#13;
Fourth, we need to know muoh more about the possible impact of&#13;
economies of scale upon household well-being. The evidence on the consumption&#13;
side that suggests big ESCJ for average US households, and the hints and&#13;
hunches that suggest such smaller ones for poor LIC households, have just been&#13;
presented. But useful policy decisions require integrated research into&#13;
scale-economies, for poor LIC households of different age- and sex-structures,&#13;
in three areas: consumption, production (especially via self-employment), and&#13;
job searoh. Different sorts of household enterprise (e.g. carpentry or&#13;
hortioulture?) and of hired employment (e.g. casual or longer-term?) make&#13;
sense for different sizes and oompositions of household. Of course, other&#13;
issues - e.g. oapital and skill requirements, seasonality of incomes, and&#13;
market structure - affoet the choice of appropriate aotivities to inorease&#13;
poor people's incomes. *However, research into their effects on&#13;
soale-economies in production and consumption is surely a high priority. Very&#13;
little is known about these issues; yet they could well turn out to be central&#13;
(saine poor households have sizes and struotures atypical of total&#13;
populations) in deciding which policies work, and which fail, in advancing&#13;
poor people's prospeots of self-suffilient esoape from poverty.&#13;
Fifth, the findings on tMIS suggest a particular form of demogramhic&#13;
as of the impact frm major policies - not just 'anti-poverty polioies' -&#13;
on the poor; for policies helpful to the poor overlap oonsiderably with&#13;
policies beneiting big households. The docile-wise MS averages (Visaria,&#13;
1980, p. 49) do not, perhaps, bring out sufficiently dramatically some of the&#13;
size differenoes between poor and rioh households. In 1972-3, in rural&#13;
Gujarat, only 2.2 percent of households in the bottom NIP decile had fewer&#13;
than three mmbers, as against 29.5 percent of households in the top deoile.&#13;
In urban Oujarat, the respective proportions were 2.7 percent and 43.2&#13;
peroent. Other Asian surveys showed similar features (ibid., p. 47). Just as&#13;
really small households tend strongly to be better off, so really big ones&#13;
tend strongly to be poor. Thus in rural N.E. Thailand in 1975-76, in the&#13;
lowest NtP quintile, 42.2% of households had nine or more members, as against&#13;
25.0% in the middle and 12.2% in the lowest quintile (Meesook, 1979, p. 65);&#13;
so about 60% of persons in the "poverty quintile" were in households of nine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71&#13;
or more. In urban Colombia in the 19708, a massive 78 pereont of households&#13;
in the lowest income-per-person deoile oontained eight persona or more - as&#13;
against 5.5 percent in the highest deoile, and 11.8 peroent overall (Birdsall,&#13;
1979, p. 132).&#13;
In suoh oiroumstanoes there is normally a powerful Doditive&#13;
relationshiD between the effeots of a DroJeot or Polioy on the poorewt and its&#13;
effeots on big households. It is, of oourse, important not to enoourage&#13;
higher fertility by the promise of bonefita to families that enlarge&#13;
themselves. However, too many policies - notably in the setting of&#13;
land-reform floors and oeilings - have been designed with little or no&#13;
attention to household size. Sinoe larger holdings are almost always&#13;
associated with larger households, it is not merely unjust, but oan sharpen&#13;
poverty, if flows or entitlements are set in terms of land-per-household,&#13;
instead of per person or per CU. 60/ More generally, a demographio assay, in&#13;
order to estimate very roughly the impaot on different sizes of households&#13;
that benefit (or lose) from alternative proposals, is on the above evidence a&#13;
vital part of any assessment of the effect on poverty of those proposals.&#13;
.9,&#13;
The demographic assay should also look at the ohild/adult ratios in&#13;
affeoted households. We have seen that these ratios tend to be bigger in (i)&#13;
big households and (ii) poor householda; and that (iii) bigger households tend&#13;
to be poorer and vice versa. Together with the dramatic eoess of ery big&#13;
households (and deficienoy of very small ones) just disoussed, thia means that&#13;
the poorest HEP deciles contain a hugely disproportionate number of children,&#13;
often in very big multi-sibling households. Sinoe life-threatening&#13;
undernutrition concentrates on ages 0-3, and is strongly linked both to&#13;
extreme poverty and - even given sooial olass and poverty - to high&#13;
birth-order and MHS (Birdsall, 1977, p. 75; Lipton, 1983), these ohildren will&#13;
in turn, include disproportionately many infants and under-fivea, often doomed&#13;
to early death, yet raising the dependency burden - and henoe the difficulty&#13;
of esoape from poverty - in the households of which they form such a large&#13;
part.&#13;
Once again, our evidence of decile average ohild/adult ratios (pp.&#13;
43-5) perhaps understated the dramatio disadvantages at the interaeotion&#13;
between severe poverty, large MHS, and high ohild/adult ratios. Around&#13;
1970-4, the quintile of households with loweat inoome-per-person oontained&#13;
one-quarter of ohildren under 15 in rural India, and about 30 peroent in&#13;
Colombia, Malaysia and Brazil (Birdoall, 1980, p. 39). In India's large&#13;
National Sample Survey in 1972-3, in the pooreat 10.35 of rural households,&#13;
51.4 peroent of persons were aged under 15 (as against 41.55 in the remaining&#13;
rural households), so that 16.85 of ohildren - supported by only 13.65 of&#13;
adults - were in this most vulnerable rural household deoile. In the poorest&#13;
9.1% of urban householda, 49.8% were ohildren (as against 37.1% in other urban&#13;
households), so that 15.35 of ohildren - supported by only 11.8% of adults -&#13;
were in thia ultra-poor urban 95 of homes (Sarvokshana, Jan. 1979, pp. 3-305,&#13;
3-369). Under-fives - oontributing only demand and not supply to the&#13;
household's eoonomio balanoo; and eopeoially vulnerable to poverty-related&#13;
physioal damage - must have been oonsiderably more heavily conoontrated in&#13;
very poor households.&#13;
Any assasment of the iopact of projeots and polioles on poor people,&#13;
then, needs to examine the effeot on large households with many ohildron. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
central issue of Part II, however, suggests a word of caution. Within a&#13;
national population, area, or social group, high MHS and high ohild/adult&#13;
ratios now tend in LICs to accompany poverty. But across areas,&#13;
land-ownership classes, jobs, castes, sexes of household heads, or other&#13;
status-linked groups, the opposite is true: as NDC history suggests, social&#13;
norms associate larger households and many children with higher status, even&#13;
though recent demographic trends and households' economic preferences&#13;
associate high MHS and child/adult ratios with lower income. Hence a&#13;
demographic assay must not be mechanical. An agricultural project might&#13;
benefit big households with many children because it provided gains mainly for&#13;
persons cultivating large acreages, or because it created labor-intensive&#13;
production opportunities for poorer people within each holding-size group&#13;
(including the landless).&#13;
While the proposed demographic components in policy formation and&#13;
property does therefore need to be fairly subtle, an elaborate exercise in&#13;
applied statistics would be too time-consuming, too vulnerable to data&#13;
limitations, and therefore a recipe for fudging and abuse. Required is simply&#13;
an intelligent attempt to address the question: do the project or policy&#13;
alternatives under review offer better, worse, or similar prospects of benefit&#13;
to big and small households, and to households with high and low child/adult&#13;
ratios, within given areas, status-groups, and total populations? That&#13;
question implies fairly self-evident "second-round" questions about impact on&#13;
poverty. The point stressed here is simply that the very sharp demographic&#13;
differences among MEP groups strongly suggest that, to attack poverty&#13;
effectively, major projects and policies require evaluation of the sizes,&#13;
structures, and demographic types of households likely to gain (or lose)&#13;
significantly.&#13;
(b) Steering resources towards given, Doverty-prone. household demographies&#13;
It is, then, clear that governments can improve their anti-poverty&#13;
policies by incorporating relevant demographic knowledge into them, and often&#13;
by undertaking new economic-demographic research. This apart, there are three&#13;
- perhaps three-and-a-half - substantive ways to adapt anti-poverty strategy&#13;
to allow for the speoial demographic oharacteristics of the various MEP&#13;
groups. The first two ways accept those characteristics as given. First,&#13;
public-sector action may seek to raise incomes, cut costs, or in other ways&#13;
provide resources, for households with sizes, structures, and associated&#13;
demographic parameters strongly linked with poverty. Second, big families&#13;
with high child/adult ratios - which include vastly disproportionate numbers&#13;
of the actually or potentially poor and ultra-poor - might be helped or&#13;
induced to alter the nature or timing of their non-demographic behaviour&#13;
(mainly job search and choice, asset size and structure, oonsumption pattern&#13;
and intra-household distribution) in ways that reduce the risks of and from&#13;
poverty, and, espeoially, ultra-poverty.&#13;
Third, public aotion can seek to ohange attitudes, incentives, laws,&#13;
technologies (inoluding contraceptive technologies), or delivery systems, in&#13;
the hope of causing potentially poor households to ohange size, structure, or&#13;
associated demographic parameters in ways tending to reduce the risk of&#13;
poverty. Finally, halfway between the first and third option, governments&#13;
might "redistribute" aocess to resources, including loans, so that poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
becomes (1) briefly life-cyclioal for many rather than prolonged for few,&#13;
and/or (ii) concentrated on parts of the family cycle where it does relatively&#13;
little permanent harm.&#13;
There is reason to expect significant, though limited, scope for the&#13;
first two types of polioy, which accept the given demographic struoture in all&#13;
MEP-groups but steer resources towards the sorts of household size,&#13;
composition, etc. more typical of poor people. Large MRS and high child/adult&#13;
ratios oharacterize the poor sufficiently to define olear demographio target&#13;
groups (subject to the caution mentioned on p. 72). In reaohing these&#13;
decisions, households are sufficiently rational, even perhaps optimizing&#13;
(Schultz, 1981; Cassen, 1978,) to suggest that the polioy-makers ought indeed&#13;
to adapt to such decisions - to attempt to dissociate them from poverty -&#13;
rather than trying to persuade people to ohange them. However, suoh&#13;
dissooiation may be an uphill task, because townward movements,&#13;
industrialization, and increased status do not appear to reduce poor people's&#13;
absolutely high MHS and child/adult ratio - indeed, may raise them relatively&#13;
to the better-off.&#13;
The extremely high propensity of poor households in LICs - and, of&#13;
course, even more so of poor people and especially children - to concentrate&#13;
in high-MHS groups, and oonversely the extreme rarity of poor single-person or&#13;
two-person households, has imnediate consequences for horizontal and vertioal&#13;
equity. In NDCs one would seek suoh consequences mainly via direct taxation.&#13;
Horizontal equity - taxing equally poor people equally - would normally be&#13;
advanced, whatever the degree of progressivity of direot taxation, by taxing&#13;
households with many CUs more lightly per CU than households with few, thus&#13;
placing a larger share of tax burdens on smaller households. Vertical equity&#13;
- taxing poor people less heavily than rich people (on the assumption that&#13;
suoh a tax-structure is needed to equalize sacrifioe, because income has&#13;
diminishing marginal utility) - would normally be advanced by even greater&#13;
shifts of the tax burden to small and "adult-intensive" households, in&#13;
particular by using a per-person rather than per-CU basis for reliefs or&#13;
allowances.&#13;
In LICs, direot taxes are normally much smaller parts of the tax&#13;
burden than in NDCs, espeoially for poor and even middle-inoome taxpayers.&#13;
Attempts to use "poor people's demographies" to select a balanoe of taxation&#13;
that improves equity - or reduces poverty - must therefore rely mainly on&#13;
indirect taxes, positive or negative (subsidies). Food looms larger in the&#13;
spending of larger households, because they tend to have higher proportions of&#13;
under-fives; and simple foods, eaten at home, appear to offer few ESCs. It&#13;
is well known that oonsumer subsidies on food - if fiscally sustainable, and&#13;
if not supported by offering below-market prices to the farm sector&#13;
(especially small farmers) - offer moat benefit, proportionately to income, to&#13;
poor households of a given size and composition, because their food/income&#13;
ratio is relatively high. It is less well recognized that food subsidies also&#13;
offer most benefit, proportionately to inoome, to big households with high&#13;
child/adult ratios (partly because children's consumption is more oonoentrated&#13;
on food than is adults' oonsumption, given outlay per CU). Such households&#13;
not only tend strongly to be poor; they are also households where poverty&#13;
carries the most serious health hazards, particularly to children and most&#13;
particularly to underfed ohidren.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
The serious problems of direct food supplementation are familiar&#13;
(see, for example, Beaton and Ghasseimi, 1982). So are the diffioulties of&#13;
targeting food subsidies to the needy (and away from well-heeled urban civil&#13;
servants, soldiers, etc.), and the apparent unpopularity in LICs of food stamp&#13;
schemes. Most seriously, perhaps, the "fiscal crisis of the State" in the&#13;
1970s showed in LICe from Sri Lanka to Egypt that more general food subsidies,&#13;
in hard times, get squeezed between rising offtake (and henee public outlays)&#13;
and lower tax revenues. Indeed, this "fiscal crisis" was also a&#13;
foreign-exchange crisis, further squeezing food subsidies between growing food&#13;
imports, discouraged domestic food producers, and recession-hit exports.61/&#13;
We nevertheless stress the demographic and health gain, to the&#13;
poorest quintile or so, of measures that (without negative impact on farm&#13;
laborers) render purchased food cheaper - especially if they can be directed,&#13;
even more than is already achieved by the high food/outlay ratio of ultra-poor&#13;
multi-child households, towards such households. The dramatically higher&#13;
incidence in such households of infant and child undernutrition and mortality&#13;
underpins the demographic evidence. There is a case, in anti-poverty polioy,&#13;
for food subsidies, stamps and supplementation. However, such measures - even&#13;
if, rightly, they are concentrated on cheap cereals and roots grown and eaten&#13;
by the poor, and are not paid for by farm-price repression - are known to be&#13;
difficult, vulnerable, and often ill-targeted remedies. Certainly, it is not&#13;
likely that tax or subsidy measures affecting non-foods can as effectively&#13;
home in on poor people's demographies. Kerosene, for cooking and heating, is&#13;
often selected for pro-poor subsidization, but is probably even harder to&#13;
target than food subsidies. Large families need less cooking, and much less&#13;
heating, per member than do small (and normally less poor and vulnerable)&#13;
ones; many of the poorest cook and heat with wood or dung, collected by&#13;
family labor and much cheaper for them than even subsidized kerosene; and&#13;
even the average LIC family spends a much smaller share of outlay on cooking&#13;
and heating than on raw foods.&#13;
Probably the standard tax-subsidy area is too narrow a field for&#13;
publio action that seeks to steer resources towards "poor people's&#13;
demographies". Thus the point is not that, because food subsidies are&#13;
difficult to handle, one should look to non-food taxes and subsidies. Rather,&#13;
the "food-centredness" of poor people's demographies provides yet another good&#13;
reason to steer public-sector activity, as a whole, more toward helping or&#13;
encouraging farmers (i) to raise their output of low-oost oalorie sources -&#13;
root-crops, millet and sorghum, maize and cassava - and/or (ii) to supply such&#13;
products to poor African and Asian people, rather than to European and&#13;
American cattle. The case for, difficulties of, and comparative-advantage&#13;
limitations upon such consumption-orientated policies are much disoussed and&#13;
will not be rehearsed here.&#13;
On the produotion side, the policy implications of poor people's&#13;
heavy concentration - especially within urban populations - into big,&#13;
multi-child households are less familiar. They go beyond mere supporting&#13;
arguments for orientations (e.g. towards food) already suggested by other,&#13;
non-demographic features of people. In particular, Droduction in or near the&#13;
home, oomplementary with ohild care (espeoially for women) and if possible&#13;
not acutely seasonal, offers special opportunities to the typioal large.&#13;
multi-child poor household.  It is quite cozon to dismiss family modes of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75&#13;
production as either old-fashioned, ineffioient and doomed, or else inevitably&#13;
"exploited" by big enterprises (espeoially through outwork). Indeed, the&#13;
daily rewards to outworkers usually oempare badly with faotory-wages for&#13;
similar work. However, for large poor households, "threatened" during and&#13;
after pregnancies by reduoed female labor participation - and above all for&#13;
the health of small children in female-headed households - home or homestead,&#13;
including artisan, self-employment (including outwork) can made the cruoial&#13;
difference between poverty and ultra-poverty.&#13;
If measures to improve the position of outworkers (perhaps especially&#13;
in the case of women) concentrated only on raising the price of domestic labor&#13;
to an unchanged structure of (price-sensitive) purohasing enterprises, such&#13;
measures would seriously damage the very groups of demographically vulnerable&#13;
poor people they sought to help. Public action, instead, should seek to&#13;
increase the bargaining and market power of outworkers, by assisting them (i)&#13;
to own a larger proportion of their productive assets (raw materials and/or&#13;
capital) individually or jointly; (ii) to control the marketing and&#13;
improvement of their produots; and (iii) to negotiate with a more competitive&#13;
structure of product buyers and materials suppliers. The demographio nature&#13;
and dynamics of poverty in female-headed households - though such poverty is&#13;
more complex, less static, and perhaps somewhat less severe than is usually&#13;
claimed - add special importance, in anti-poverty policy, to the largely&#13;
neglected area of domestic, especially rural, artisan and hawking enterprises.&#13;
Many examples could be given of the general principle here suggested:&#13;
that, in assessing how any policy of proposal affects the poor, one should&#13;
consider carefully its impact on large, multi-child households. (Conversely,&#13;
transfers of resources to small households in LICs - though frequently not in&#13;
NDCs - are likely to harm the poor). Measures affecting the demographic&#13;
parameters that underlie MHS - migration, fertility, complexity, migration,&#13;
etc. - are considered in Seo. (d) below.&#13;
However, age-sex-status interaotions affeot even the part of&#13;
anti-poverty policy that consists of statio resouroe allocation among&#13;
households with different demographic structures. In Sec. III we saw that&#13;
female exposure to poverty risk was associated with (i) certain sorts of&#13;
(usually unmarried) civil status, and sex-imbalance in the household, which&#13;
both also damaged males, though rather less; (ii) difficulty - not shared by&#13;
men - in increasing income with age after about 30, and reflecting difficulty&#13;
(partly due to discrimination) in acquiring assets and education; (iii)&#13;
following this, not so much static disadvantage vis-'a-vis (i.e. greater&#13;
poverty than among) men, but rather a lesser prospeot of escape, and less&#13;
confinement of poverty to a shortish period of the life-cycle. These three&#13;
facts add relevanoe to policies on self-employment, and on very small-soale,&#13;
household-level ownership of appropriate assets, in any attempt to&#13;
redistribute resources to households which - notably because of age or sex or&#13;
HH - may be at especially high risk of poverty.&#13;
(c) Non-demoxraphic behavior of big. poor households&#13;
The concentration of poverty and ultra-poverty upon big households&#13;
with high child/female and child/adult ratios (and youngish heads) is comon&#13;
to many LICs. Yet not all such households, at all times, are poor. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76&#13;
particular, the transition from poverty to extreme poverty is often not&#13;
accompanied by a further rise in MHS, child/female, or child/adult ratios.&#13;
Moreover, in NDCs, these parameters tended actually to fall with increasing&#13;
pressure of poverty; and, even in LICs today, at each level of MEP a low&#13;
"status" (asset ownership, landholding, job type, location, etc.) accompanies&#13;
low MHS. All this suggests that the nature or timing of household behaviour&#13;
can "de-link" inherently unfavorable demographic characteristics from the&#13;
poverty normally associated with them. How, if at all, can policy help in&#13;
this de-linking? The question acquires special importance from the high&#13;
incidence of especially vulnerable persons - children under five - in&#13;
demographically typical poor LIC households.&#13;
One option is in the area of job search and choice. Women and older&#13;
siblings are often prevented from earning by the need to care for under-fives.&#13;
Apart from appropriate artisan or trading activities based on the home (Sec.&#13;
(b)), rural works programs such as Maharashtra's Employment Guarantee Scheme -&#13;
programs that guarantee work near home, and/or by piece-rates or otherwise&#13;
permit substitution among family members - can greatly assist such households&#13;
to raise their participation rates: can de-link high child/adult ratios from&#13;
low participation. So can information, or transport, to help the process of&#13;
short-term (or even daily) intra-rural migration.&#13;
In urban areas, of course, legislation that restrains retailing&#13;
(including hawking), rickshaws, poultry-keeping, repair work, and other&#13;
home-based enterprise is especially damaging to big, poor families with high&#13;
proportions of females in the potential workforce. Such females are&#13;
especially likely to be able to combine income-earning work with family&#13;
obligations only through home-based "informal" activity. The higher&#13;
female/male ratio (yet also much higher MHS) among the urban poor, as compared&#13;
to other urban households, renders building, zoning, licensing, labor, and&#13;
other controls on urban informal activity - controls nominally designed to&#13;
help poor people - counter-productive in the context of anti-poverty policy,&#13;
unless needed for health and safety. More usually, such controls are merely&#13;
concealed protectionism for big enterprise, public and private, that both&#13;
competes with informal family firms and intervenes in the administration of&#13;
controls that restrict their activity.&#13;
Options also occur in respect of asset size and structure. As for&#13;
human assets, the familiar linkage of secondary female education to low&#13;
fertility implies that families with many children are likely to have mothers&#13;
with, at best, primary schooling; neither such schooling nor post-primary&#13;
terminal or adult-education courses typically help working mothers to combine&#13;
family and work management better. It is often rightly stressed (Lloyd, 1979;&#13;
Bromley (ed.), 1978) that poor, big families usually cope very well with&#13;
horrifying difficulties; however, their very different success (given the&#13;
level of poverty) in avoiding undernutrition or ill-health (C. Shah, 1979)&#13;
shows that there is something to learn. As regards productive physical assets&#13;
- land, craft machinery, durable consumer goods, or bicycles fungible between&#13;
production and consumption uses - the very poor usually own very little; but,&#13;
as indicated aboves much more needs to be known about which assets are&#13;
critical for poverty-prone large families.&#13;
Consumption patterns of poor families with many small ohildren may&#13;
well account for their dramatically greater vulnerability to nutritional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77&#13;
stress and even death (Ruzicka, 1982; Birdsall, 1974, 1980). The combination&#13;
of childbirth, a normally hungry season, and an atypically bad year can impose&#13;
"breaking strains" upon families for whom even their normal MHS and&#13;
child/adult ratios mean some risk. It is not known whether such high-risk&#13;
families (and seasons) overlap with high, or low, availability and use of&#13;
primary health facilities; once more, in health policy too, appropriate&#13;
effort to mitigate the effects of given "demographies of poverty" could&#13;
achieve as much, in reducing at least short-run ultra-poverty, as ambitious&#13;
attempts to change them.&#13;
On the other hand, exhortation to poor parents to "improve"&#13;
allocation of food or health-care, towards small children or females within&#13;
their large families, might achieve rather little. Intra-family&#13;
"misallocations" are (i) perhaps less common than is often alleged, (ii)&#13;
often, rational responses to terrible dilemmas (Lipton, 1983, Sec. III(a)).&#13;
Appropriate assets and work chances, not lectures on ethics, are what is&#13;
required.&#13;
(d) Policies to change the demographies of the poor&#13;
Historically, poor households tended to be smaller, and to have lower&#13;
child/adult ratios, than better-off households. This reduced both the number&#13;
of persons affected by a given incidence of household poverty, and the&#13;
proportion of those poor persons consisting of children under five - the most&#13;
vulnerable to permanent harm, even death, from poverty-induced undernutrition&#13;
or illness. Unfortunately, the relationship has been reversed in most LICs.&#13;
Is there scope for policy to help restore it - to de-link high MHS, and high&#13;
child/adult ratios, from the risk of poverty and especially of ultra-poverty?&#13;
1. Fertility&#13;
Fertility probably plays the main role in the reversal of&#13;
historically positive affluence-MHS correlations in today's LICs. It is&#13;
better-off women who - in four interlocked processes - have come to adopt&#13;
modern contraception, to receive post-primary education, to marry later, and&#13;
to reduce marital fertility. Can and should policy attempt to distribute&#13;
these forms of behavior differently among income-groups?&#13;
We cannot here review the massive literature on family planning.&#13;
Clearly, however, policies to increase the use of modern means of&#13;
contraception have been motivated mainly by the quest for growth in GNP per&#13;
person - by the wish to divert personal savings and public investment from&#13;
"widening" uses that merely maintain, for a larger population, existing levels&#13;
of capital, land, education, etc., towards "deepening" uses that increase&#13;
per-person availability of such sources of growth. Accordingly, as almost all&#13;
KAP studies confirm, access to and offtake of modern means of contraception&#13;
have in most LICs concentrated on the readier customers, notably better-off,&#13;
better-educated urban women.&#13;
Even from the standpoint of growth, this emphasis on low-oost&#13;
aoceptors - apparently such good economio sense - may have been misplaced.&#13;
Many suoh acceptors had probably already attained their family size norm. By&#13;
adopting modern oontraception, they were shifting to more aesthetic methods of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78&#13;
contraception, rather than reduoing age-specifio fertility. Certainly, in any&#13;
event, modern contraoeption in most LICe - there are familiar, striking&#13;
exceptions - neither got far down the scale of income-per-person nor achieved&#13;
the hoped-for big reductions in overall birth-rates.&#13;
From our standpoint - that of delinking poverty from the riskiest&#13;
sorts of demographic structure - the policy of concentrating attempts to&#13;
spread modern oontraception upon ready acceptors was plainly unhelpful.&#13;
Absolutely, poor families gained little: too little, for poor ohildren, to&#13;
meet the new need. This need was to cut fertility (so as to free household&#13;
resources for existing children) enough to counterbalance the effects of&#13;
public-health measures - especially malaria oontrol - in increasing infant and&#13;
child survival rates, and thereby reduoing resources-per-person. Relatively,&#13;
poor families probably lost out as contraception spread, because their MHS was&#13;
reduced much less than was that of better-off families; this probably raised&#13;
the supply of unskilled labor (especially from the poor) relative to demand&#13;
(especially from the better-off), rendering poor people's unskilled&#13;
wage-rates, especially in domestic and personal service, lower than they would&#13;
have been in the absence of "rich-selective" contraception.&#13;
With all due respect to the view that the poor choose their&#13;
fertility and MHS - a view supported by much, but not all, evidence on&#13;
traditional fertility controls - such choice is bound to inoorporate some&#13;
insurance against childlessness, especially given the risks to women of&#13;
unsupported widowhood. Insurance implies produoing a larger expeoted number&#13;
of children than the family size norm, so as to avert some of the very serious&#13;
risks involved in ending up with a smaller number. Better oontrol of&#13;
mortality and fertility for the poor, therefore, could be substantially&#13;
MHS-reduoing. While attempts at compulsion are probably unethical and&#13;
certainly counter-productive, there is a strong welfare case for improved&#13;
parental control of, information about, and acoess to contraception for the&#13;
poor, accompanied by appropriate changes in incentives. Forms of insurance&#13;
alternative to high child/adult ratios - from reduced infant mortality via&#13;
better access to health care as in Kerala, to employment guarantees or even&#13;
social old-age support - would, in respeot of impact on poor people's&#13;
fertility and 1HS, at least justify closely-monitored experiments.&#13;
Another indirect approach is relevant too. The family-planning&#13;
literature is replete with evidence that, even holding earnings constant,&#13;
female post-primary education delays marriage and reduces marital fertility.&#13;
Yet suoh education is concentrated on the better-off, whose MHS is already&#13;
smaller, and whose children are much less likely to suffer lasting damage from&#13;
high MHS. It is often argued that a very wide spread of primary education is&#13;
needed first, (i) on efficiency grounds in order to improve the intake (and&#13;
hence efficiency) of post-primary education , (ii) on equity grounds, so that&#13;
more should obtain basic skills before expanding privileged aocess to further&#13;
eduoation. These arguments have foroe; however, primary education -&#13;
especially if incomplete - seems to do little to out fertility or delay&#13;
marriage. These effects do appear to improve the equity case for continuing&#13;
to concentrate some expansion upon post-primary schooling, if the access to it&#13;
can be saread to poor DeoDle. If so, such schooling is likely to cut their&#13;
fertility and 141, to ease the escape from poverty, and to soften the&#13;
oonsequenoes of ultra-poverty. In any case, it is questionable whether laws&#13;
and exhortation can do nearly as much as mass post-primary education to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79&#13;
spread, into poor households, the oase for later marriages - as a oomparison&#13;
of Sri Lanka and India shows.&#13;
The effects of most polioies regarding fertility, howeverp are&#13;
clouded. It appears to show a -,~      -shaped relationship to affluence, as&#13;
well as to education. Improvements in the lot of "the poorest of the poor"&#13;
may well raise fertility and 4HS, at least in the short term. This is&#13;
associated with the flattening-out observed among these households in the&#13;
rise, with falling MEP, in MHS and child/adult ratios. However, the top of&#13;
the fertility-affluence .-   N~ (like the flattening-out in the poverty-MHS&#13;
curve) appears to occur at a very low level of well-being; all but the very&#13;
poorest 5-10% of Indian households seems to show declining fertility, MHS and&#13;
child/adult ratios as cross-section MEP rises.&#13;
2. Mortality&#13;
Since 1945, malaria control has spread through most LICs, alongside&#13;
major improvements in food security during famine. Both malaria and famine&#13;
have recurred in some areas, but their reduction has brought big reduotions in&#13;
IMR and child mortality. For better-off parents, it increasingly looked both&#13;
safe and rewarding to restrict fertility in response, completing a demographic&#13;
transition; for most people, and especially the poorest 30-50 percent of&#13;
parents, it did not. Hence falling IMRs, together with selective fertility&#13;
responses, have in LICs played a big part in reversing the traditional link of&#13;
low MHS to poverty.&#13;
This aocount, however over-simplified, may remove the fears that&#13;
"harsh realism", in neo-Malthusian guise, destroys the benefits of better&#13;
child health for poor people, because such "improvement" brings a higher&#13;
household size, dependency burdens, and thus for the ultra-poor more&#13;
undernutrition, disease and death. Any such argument, let alone an inferenoe&#13;
that "health for all" might not do the poor any good, is quite unjustified.&#13;
"Thinking the unthinkable" is not laudable if the thought-prooesses are&#13;
muddled or wrong.&#13;
Several pieces of cross-section evidence from Seo. II(e) reinforce&#13;
the policy conclusion that better health and lower mortality for poor&#13;
children, except perhaps in the very short run, will help to dissooiate high&#13;
14S from poverty. (Juat one example: in India, urban areas - and the State&#13;
of Kerala - already show both lower IMRs and lower fertility.) It is,&#13;
however, the poorest and remotest households that, discontinuously, suffer&#13;
much higher infant and child mortality - but do not over-insure, or perhaps&#13;
even respond fully, by raising their fertility. If the reasons are partly&#13;
physical, it is possible that better nutrition (via higher household inoome)&#13;
will raise fertility as well as cutting mortality. Since the groups affected&#13;
are the very poorest, however (Table 12) - by no means a majority even of the&#13;
nutritionally at-risk ultra-poor - this would be a short-term effect, while&#13;
the bottom 5-10 percent of people reaohed the health and/or income levels of&#13;
the next 10-15 percent. However, it does suggest an addendum, or converse, to&#13;
the (probably correct) conventional wisdom that seeks to inoorporate family&#13;
planning programs into wider maternal and child health care; it also makes&#13;
sense to accompany programs of preventive medcline with arrangements to make&#13;
appropriate means of contraception readily available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80&#13;
3. Complexity&#13;
Whatever the possible entrepreneurial drawbacks of complex&#13;
producer-consumer families, they provide mutual insurance, some ESCs, and&#13;
perhaps assistance in some forms of domestic production. As explained in&#13;
Sec.II(h), it is better-off households that often seem to have the explicit&#13;
option of complex status. Poor households mostly enlarge, perhaps via&#13;
implicit choice (Schultz, 1981), but by only partly controlled excesses of&#13;
births over deaths. Can policy ease the path of poor households towards&#13;
choosing complex status where appropriate?&#13;
At present, this often fails to happen because, though household&#13;
members as a whole would stand to gain, individuals might lose, and "veto"&#13;
complexity by setting up independent homes. Direct intra-household&#13;
intervention by Government (here as with food distribution between daughters,&#13;
sons and parents) seems infeasible; but can the non-zero-sum game be made&#13;
easier to play? Provision of competitive (rather than subsidized) credit for&#13;
domestic production activities that offer advantages to parent/child or&#13;
multi-sibling co-operation - such as trading, dairying or some forms of&#13;
artisanship - could be one way forward. It depends, however, on steering such&#13;
loans to poor people who would thereby be helped to choose household&#13;
complexity: a tall order for a government agency. More credible, perhaps,&#13;
might be measures to help groups of houses, in slum areas or (in India)&#13;
scheduled-caste quarters, to use common facilities requiring several users to&#13;
be economic: standpipes, even sometimes small bio-gas plants. That way, the&#13;
advantages of complexity might become more accesible to the very poor, even if&#13;
the mutuality required for joint household formation remains rare among them.&#13;
4. Migration&#13;
Once again, an explicit and clearly voluntary route to adjustment of&#13;
MHS appears to be relatively less open, or less rewarding, for very poor&#13;
households, leaving such households with fewer options than others in&#13;
responding to unexpected deaths, conceptions, or income changes. Poor&#13;
people's migration is shorter-term, shorter-range, less "urbanizing" and&#13;
educated, and less prepared (i.e. more prone to painful learning-by-doing)&#13;
than the migration of the better-off. The ultra-poor, except in desperation,&#13;
usually lack the resources for prolonged job search (or income delay), and&#13;
migrate only seasonally, along familiar but very low-yielding tracks. Better&#13;
information about rural work chances, possibly through registers of available&#13;
work and skills, could "piggyback" very cheaply on mobile government services&#13;
- input delivery, health, extension, etc. - within an area.&#13;
Most discussions of migration policy seem to concentrate upon whether&#13;
and how, if at all, it should seek to change the scale of migration. But the&#13;
structures of migration (by age and sex, origin and destination, duration, MEP&#13;
decile, etc.) - even if chosen optimally, given the often high and&#13;
price-discriminating search costs, by each household - involve major negative&#13;
externalities (i) for individuals within some households, (ii) for groups of&#13;
households (migrant, resident, low-MEP...) taken together. Townward migration&#13;
structures in Asia are such that the poorest two or three urban deciles at&#13;
least escape the hugely unbalanced male/female ratios that characterize&#13;
better-off urban groups - but suffer correspondingly high MHSs and child/adult&#13;
ratios. Customary areas of origin, using special information (normally from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81.,&#13;
relatives), monopolize net gains, though also some (gross) losses, from&#13;
emigration; if, as one would expect, the gains carry diminishing returns and&#13;
the losses increasing costs, then a strong case can be made for adaptive&#13;
regional policies on information, transport flows, even education. In any&#13;
case - as with complexity, so with migration - more thought is needed about&#13;
policies to widen the range of poor and ultra-poor households' explicit and&#13;
well-informed demographic responses.&#13;
5. Non-family household members&#13;
In Sec. II(k), following Hajnal (1982), we emphasized the importance&#13;
of yet a third demographic option - "going into service" with the better-off -&#13;
as a link, now cut, that was historically chosen by many poor households in&#13;
order to attain a tolerably low MHS, both directly and as a means to deferred&#13;
marriage and hence reduced lifetime fertility. In this choice must be&#13;
included many sorts of resident apprenticeship - which, as readers of ohs.&#13;
8-10 of Oliver Twist will recall, often involved poor children in dubious as&#13;
well as serf-like activities, not only in LICsl&#13;
Certainly there can be no question of policies that re-create&#13;
resident "service" as a major option for poor teenagers (though some would&#13;
argue that military service performed an analogous role). At most, it might&#13;
be argued that, in locating public-sector construction and other activities&#13;
demanding a locaily resident workforce, authorities might give preference,&#13;
ceteris paribus, to areas with many big, poor households. Also - as in the&#13;
case of outworkers - resident domestic servants should be protected, not by&#13;
wage or other legislation that prices them into unemployment (or back into&#13;
overcrowded and poor homes), but by information, options, and access to&#13;
publicly-provided health and education, at the expense of the general&#13;
taxpayers and not as a specific tax against forms of employment that ease the&#13;
burdens of big and poor households.&#13;
The main point about resident service, apprenticeship, etc., is that&#13;
it represents just one example of the decline of traditional social-security&#13;
systems that once protected the ultra-poor. With both labor and labor-saving&#13;
devices more plentiful, relative to other capital, in today's LICs, than&#13;
during early industrialization of the NDCs, neither "moral community" nor&#13;
class interest is so likely to persuade the better-off to preserve the very&#13;
poor in hard times. Resident service and apprenticeship are further&#13;
threatened by greater mobility - of homes, labor, and capital - and by&#13;
research-based scale-economies in mass-produced goods and services (including&#13;
processing and distribution) that compete against small-scale,&#13;
little-researched traditional and domestic skills. Yet the demography of&#13;
poverty feeds on itself: if very poor couples cannot be sure of placing a&#13;
child in resident (and probably income-remitting) work outside the home, and&#13;
if security in old age is also lacking, they are driven to provide their own&#13;
security by procreating larger, child/intensive, and hence persistently poor&#13;
households. Unless some form of publicly provided security system or&#13;
asset-provision or employment-guarantee substitutes, in our new labor-surplus&#13;
world, for the old and imperfect (yet real) social security of traditional&#13;
communities, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that each poor household must&#13;
- if it is rational - insure itself by procreative behaviour; this both&#13;
impedes "capital deepening" and - by raising poor households' MHS and&#13;
dependency ratios and ultimately by raising unskilled labor supply ahead of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82&#13;
demand - perpetuates poverty.&#13;
(e) Poverty, policy and the family cycle&#13;
The role of the family cycle in poverty in most LICs is too small;&#13;
if it were larger (provided chidren oould be safeguarded) poor people would be&#13;
better off. This is only a pseudo-paradox. Family-cycle poverty comes and&#13;
goes. Its temporary nature (i) reduces the welfare loss, (ii) makes it&#13;
victims more creditworthy.&#13;
The evidence tentatively suggests that a given "amount" of poverty in&#13;
a typical year (i.e. say, of headcount below a fixed poverty-line, times&#13;
average shortfall, modified to allow for intra-poor distribution a la Sen,&#13;
1981) is much more life-cyclical, and much less concentrated upon a few&#13;
lifelong victims, (i) in LICs than elsewhere, and, relatedly, (ii) in&#13;
micro-societies, to the extent that status, jobs, assets, and earning power&#13;
are ascribed rather than achieved. This is an empirical statement only - it&#13;
need not be true. If all jobs and assets are allocated in perfect markets,&#13;
there will be a lifelong poor underclass unable, in such&#13;
achievement-orientated societies, to achieve much. It is contingent, not&#13;
necessary, that the lifelong poor group of households ascribed low-earning&#13;
assets, jobs, etc., in asoription-orientated societies constitutes a much&#13;
larger proportion of the poor than does the "underclass" in&#13;
achievement-orientated ones. However, it does seem to be clearly the oase.&#13;
Hence policies to improve the functioning of labor markets, and to equalize&#13;
access to them, are likely to reduce the "illfare" created by poverty, because&#13;
such policies render poverty brief for many instead of durable for few.&#13;
The proviso that children must be protected is, however, important.&#13;
Otherwise, a shift from lifelong to life-cycle poverty could harm the poorest.&#13;
That is because life-cycle poverty in LICs - unlike NDCs, - concentrate much&#13;
more heavily on youngish couples with several small children than on, say, old&#13;
single persons. More spending on child health and nutrition, especially on&#13;
helping the near-landless to feed their children enough calories, is therefore&#13;
necessary if the poor are to be helped by policies making poverty more&#13;
life-cyclical.&#13;
Such policies would consist, above all, of steps to improve the&#13;
access of currently weak groups - in different sooieties they might be women,&#13;
over-fifties, countryfolk, scheduled castes, minority religions, etc. - to the&#13;
means of exit from poverty. The apparent difficulty of Batawana women in&#13;
acquiring assets after age 30 is a case in point: almost oertainly, oapital&#13;
markets are less open to them than to men. Laws, inoentives, and market&#13;
organization - all combined in suoh prejudices as that against labor as loan&#13;
collateral - all combine to create artificial barriers against escape from&#13;
poverty; polioy should seek to remove those barriers.&#13;
If growth is slow and asset distribution fairly fixed, such policy&#13;
will not normally reduce poverty. It will, instead, shift it from being&#13;
mainly a lifelong condition for some, to being a temporary life-oyclical&#13;
condition for many. That is a limited achievement. To do more almost&#13;
certainly depends on asset redistribution and rapid growth. In any context,&#13;
policies that neglect the quite distinotive demographic circumstances of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83&#13;
poor, however well designed in other respeots, oan have serious unintended&#13;
effects on poor households in general, and in particular on the vulnerable&#13;
children so severely over-represented among the ultra-poor. Demographic assay&#13;
of the anti-poverty impaot of major proposed policies (Seo.(a)) io, therefore,&#13;
a clear-out need in eaoh speoific situation, whether or not the inevitably&#13;
general and tentative polioy proposals advanced elsewhere are deemed&#13;
appropriate.&#13;

Notes:&#13;
Normally, operators "in cultivation, etc." all derived their main income from farming. An unstated number in Afawa and&#13;
Dingri derived It from animal husbandry or dairying, as did one of the 76 households in Moti Khadol (2 persons; 51.3%&#13;
of income from primary source; 787 Rs. per household yearly), one of the 133 in Samaldevi (2; percentage not available;&#13;
about 875 Rs.), 9 of the 99 in Falna (55; 86.3%; 855 Rs.), and 9 of the 105 in Hasteda (50; 76.2%; 634 Rs.). In&#13;
Nargol, all the "cultivation, etc." operators were fishing families; the "agricultural" labor all derived its main&#13;
income from fishing employment; and the non-operating owners, described as having their main income as rentlers, pre-&#13;
sumably own and rent out boats. For Samaldevi, the last two columns are interpolated, and very approximate for small&#13;
samples (indicated by brackets).   In Uoedpur, three households with no apparent income source were omitted from Table&#13;
17. Other minor differences between a few population and household totals (especially for population in Hasteda), between -&#13;
Tables 16 and 17, reflect the sources, presumably because household sizes or numbers varied between visits to measure&#13;
occupational and caste data.&#13;
Data sets for each village are as complete as the sources permit. However, the last three columns were deliberately&#13;
estimated for the total of villages, because this would involve adding up incomes for different years (of the various&#13;
surveys)and different villages (with different price-levels), to misleading effect.&#13;

Notes:    The entry for rural Uttar Pradesh for example, should be read:   "The MEP groups comprising the poorest 10.7%&#13;
of households showed no systematic fall in MHS group means as MEP rose. From the highest of these very poor&#13;
groups (i.e. the poorest 10.7% of households minus the very poorest 5.3%), to the group immediately below&#13;
the very richest 0.6% of households, MHS consistently fell as group mean MEP rose.    This relationship&#13;
therefore applied to the 'middle' 88.7%-94.1% of households."    There are 14 MEP groups in each State.&#13;
(a) Nearest approximation to entries: 2.6-6.3; 93.2-95.9; 0.50. However, among the eleven "middle"&#13;
MEP groups, two show slight reversals of the otherwise steady downtrend of group mean MRS with&#13;
rising NIP.&#13;

FOOTNOTES&#13;
1.     Poverty and ultra-poverty are here treated as oharaoteristios of&#13;
households, for three reasons. First, it is by the household that&#13;
incomes and spending are pooled and surveyed. Second, policy leverage&#13;
on intra-household distribution is small. Third, severe deprivation&#13;
of individuals - e.g. girls - within households sufficiently well-off&#13;
to feed all their members adequately is probably muoh rarer than is&#13;
usually argued - and where present is not readily amenable to polioy,&#13;
except by enriching the household overall. See Lipton, 1983, Sec.&#13;
III(a).&#13;
2.     "Poverty" here means insuffioient income (or outlay) to provide&#13;
household members with 100% of 1973 average FAO/WHO caloric&#13;
requirements of their age, sex and activity groups, when the household&#13;
allocates inoome (or outlay) among foods, and betweeen them and&#13;
non-foods, typioally for households with its size, age- and&#13;
sex-structure, and income (or outlay). "Ultra-poverty" replaces&#13;
"100%" with "80%" in the above definition. Poverty and ultra-poverty&#13;
may be assessed by surveying (per-person or per-CU) household income&#13;
or outlay, food oonsumption, food/outlay ratios, caloric intake&#13;
relative to requirements, or anthropometrio status. See Lipton, 1983,&#13;
Sec. I.&#13;
3.     "Denominator" in that household resouroes might be divided by number&#13;
of members, by number of adult-equivalents, or not at all. "Resouroes"&#13;
are used to oover any of several alternate measures of family access to&#13;
the means to avoid poverty: to income, outlay, or - quite plausibly&#13;
where 70-80% or more of outlay is on food - calories.&#13;
4.     For classifioation of households, see Laslett and Wall, 1972, pp. 31,&#13;
41-2, and below, fn. 16.&#13;
5.     These two offsets are not universal.  Until recent times (pp. 7-8) -&#13;
and probably still, where neither publio health nor income levels have&#13;
started to improve - bigger households tended to have higher&#13;
adult/child ratios, and to be better-off. In such ciroumstances,&#13;
ranking of households, household deciles, or areas in rising order of&#13;
resources-per-household would give even less guidanoe, if possible, to&#13;
ranking in terms of poverty incidence.&#13;
6.     However, even if we know nothint about oausality, we shall looate&#13;
"poverty projeots" better ir we know the demographic charaoteristics&#13;
of the poor, and where those oharaoteristics are to be found. See&#13;
Sec. V.&#13;
7.     Wachter and Laslett, 1978, pp. 76-7, argue that the increase is only&#13;
"at first flush" and is shown, by simulation of evolving populations,&#13;
to be statistically unsurprising. However, the simulation predicts&#13;
ranges of oontinuous change in MHS; Laslett'J data appear to show a&#13;
marked disoontinuity around 1750 or so. See also Nakane, 1972, p. 531.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8.     This implies that positive linka of poverty to household size within a&#13;
status-group of households are likely to be even stronger than in total&#13;
populations of households - especially if the group comprises a large&#13;
part of the population, and has little soope for inoreasing assets and&#13;
status within its ranks as M1S rises.   Henoe the impaot of MRS on the&#13;
logarithm of poverty-risk, in large rural Indian saples in 1968-70,&#13;
was much larger for the 900-odd oasual-labor households than for the&#13;
2350-odd cultivator households, and larger for the latter than for the&#13;
4100 households pooled from all groups: Gaiha, 1983, Tables 13, 18, 19.&#13;
9.     For the seventeen villages where NHS and income-per-person oan be&#13;
estimated from Table 3, allowing for ohanges in the price-index for&#13;
agricultural labor in the two States between survey yearst and&#13;
oonverting from Gujarat to Rajasthan prioes by using the data in&#13;
Chatterjee and Bhattacharya, 1974, pp. 344-6, we obtained the&#13;
correlation between village MRS and village average real&#13;
inoome-per-person: r = -.2403, n 2 17, n.s.&#13;
10.    Calculated by B. Longhurst from Norman et al., 1976.&#13;
11.    Sarvekshana, Jan. 1979, pp. S293-8305 and S356-S369.   The details are&#13;
set out in Table 12.&#13;
12.    This study indirectly suggests that marital fertility helps explain&#13;
both parts of our paradox, in Kerala at least; for it decreases as NCP&#13;
rises (Zachariah and Kurup, 1982, Table 3).&#13;
13.    In both cases, MHS for craftsmen is now below village average MHSs.&#13;
This contrasts with the opposite tendenoy in "proto-industrializing"&#13;
NDCs (Andorka and Farago, 1983, p. 295; Wall, 1983, p. 448, and 1983a,&#13;
p. 388). Perhaps the lower status and household size of artisans in&#13;
many LICs today "pushes" bigger villages, with a greater artisan&#13;
oomponent, towards lower MHS?&#13;
14.    Jains are classified as 'high Hindus' in these surveys, though some&#13;
would consider them a distinct religion. In Table 5, we have made&#13;
minor ohanges to two surveys, to reconcile their classifioation of&#13;
castes with that used by the other ten.&#13;
15.    A tradition of arranged marriages - linked to the risk of being left as&#13;
a single-parent family with no obvious means of support - imposed very&#13;
low illegitimacy rates on many pre-industrial sooieties in the past&#13;
(Laslett, 1971, pp. 142-5). It is reasonable to hypothesize that this&#13;
applies even more strongly to most LIC societies today, so that lower&#13;
marital fertility normally means lower oouple fertility, not high&#13;
bastardy rates - but this requires research and evidence.&#13;
16.    We use the classifioation of co-resident families used by Laslett,&#13;
1972a, p. 31. (A) Nuclear or simple a (1) sole (solitary), or (2) "no&#13;
familY' (*resident unmarried siblings or other relatives, or&#13;
unrelated persons), or (3) simDle (married couples or single parents&#13;
with ohildren). (B) Complex = (4) extended (nuclear plus relative(s)&#13;
of an earlier generation: extended uvwarde, e.g. by the presence of a&#13;
nuclear spouse's parent or aunt of a later generation; or extended&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
112&#13;
downwards, e.g. by a nuclear spouse's grandchild; or extended&#13;
laterally, e.g. by a nuclear spouse's sibling or cousin of the same&#13;
generation); or (5) multiDle, with two or more related conjugal&#13;
families, again up, or down, or on one level with the household head; a&#13;
special case of the latter is the a "frerechem, with no "member of an&#13;
earlier generation [but] married siblings connected entirely through&#13;
the filial linkage of each to a conjugal unit no longer represented in&#13;
the household" (ibid., p. 30). There remains a handful (6)&#13;
Indeterminate. In this paper "household" means "co-resident family&#13;
plus resident servants, lodgers, or other unrelated inmates"; "family"&#13;
always means "co-resident family" unless otherwise stated.&#13;
17.    On its own, this first effect does not alter the absolute gap between&#13;
rich and poor HHS, but does make rich households' MHS - if initially&#13;
larger than poor households' HHS, as in PI-NDCs - somewhat smaller (or&#13;
less big) relatively to, i.e. as a ratio to, poorer households' HHS.&#13;
Suppose that children either die in the first year of life, or survive&#13;
through adolesoence. Now, let IMR fall due to the conquest of&#13;
illnesses that had earlier killed 1 infant in 10, irrespeotive of&#13;
poverty. Then IMR for the rich might fall from 200 to 100, and for the&#13;
poor from 300 to 200. Assuming ten births per couple rich or poor,&#13;
MHS, with all children and parents at home, would rise from 10 to 11&#13;
for the rich, and from 9 to 10 for the poor. The gap stays the same,&#13;
but "rich" MHS falls from 111% to 1105 of "poor" MKS; other changes,&#13;
e.g. decline of resident servants, could then easily bring it below&#13;
100%. (If we allow for the fact that subsequent mortality (between&#13;
infancy and adolescence) probably was similarly reduoed by&#13;
income-neutral health improvements, these would then shrink the&#13;
rich/poor MHS ratio more - but still not affect the absolute MHS gap).&#13;
18.    In 100 English oommunities, 1574-1821, community HHS was correlated&#13;
with (1) proportion of households with servants (simple r = .599), (2)&#13;
proportion of gentry (.528), (3) servant/population ratio (.437), (4)&#13;
child/population ratio (-.335) and (5) proportion of households headed&#13;
by married oouples (.296). In 382 oommunities in Suwa county, Japan,&#13;
1671-1870, comparable significant results were (1) .444; (2) n.a.; (3)&#13;
n.a., but .402 for servant/household ratio (two other servant&#13;
indicators also &gt; .25); (4) n.a., but r for ratio of children under 10&#13;
to married women aged 21-40 was +.319 (and for unmarried&#13;
children/household heads ratio, .529); (5) .600 (two other indioators&#13;
of marital inoidence were p.83); (6) proportion of households with&#13;
three or more generations, .529; (7) ditto without resident kin, -.684&#13;
(100 English, .0031); (8) proportion of females aged 12-40 married,&#13;
-0.167(1). All significant at 1%, except (4) for UK (55). Laslett,&#13;
1972, p. 155; Hayami and Uchida, 1972, p. 492.&#13;
19.    One can add to Schultz's reasons for implying "No". Windfall oil-based&#13;
incomes reduce the oosts of child-oare (especially by immigrants); so&#13;
does the relatively small likelihood of "modernizing away" complex&#13;
families. Yet I would answer "Yes": higher inoome oan permit a&#13;
Government to provide (a) social-seourity systems that reduce even the&#13;
poorer Libyan's need to rely on his children for his old age, and (b)&#13;
post-primary education to mothers, reducing fertility (p. 22) - and to&#13;
children, raising the costs of rearing them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
113&#13;
20.    Indeed, in the poorest countries, women with some primary sohooling&#13;
have slightly higher fertility than women with no eduoation -&#13;
oonsistently with the inverse U; see Birdsall, 1980, p. 49.&#13;
21.    See fn. 16; higher adult death-rates would also reduce incidenoe of&#13;
extended families, but the efrect on multiple families, up or down from&#13;
the household head, is greater.&#13;
22.    This is an aspeot of "Sanskritization": Srinivas, 1962.&#13;
23.    Dirrerences significant at 5% and 10% respectively.   Average holding&#13;
per person was also somewhat bigger in complex than in nuclear&#13;
oo-resident families.&#13;
24.    The wrong assumptions that (a) most LIC cities are dominated by recent&#13;
migrants or (b) migrants, even long-settled ones, have relatively small&#13;
households, may well be to blame for the widespread belief that in&#13;
LICs urban households are generally and signifioantly smaller (and less&#13;
likely to be complex) than rural households.&#13;
25.    For seven observations each on student migrants (as proportion of total&#13;
population) and on working migrants (proportion of adults), the simple&#13;
r with average household size was, respectively, -.5970 and -.6825: see&#13;
Connell et al., 1976, p. 193, and Table 3 of this paper for MHSs.&#13;
26.    In Villgraten village, Austria, in 1781, "households with more grown-up&#13;
children, other things equal, had fewer servants ... Peasants ... (all&#13;
owning 10-14 cattle and/or horses) who had no children above (10&#13;
averaged] 2.71 servants (28 cases); with one child, they had 2.45(11);&#13;
with two, 1.64(14); with three, 1.06(18); with four, 0.72(18); and with&#13;
five, 0.07(14)" (Schmidtbauer, 1983, p. 355).&#13;
27.    It might be argued that this was a fault in the right direotion.   Suoh&#13;
an argument is not mere rhetorlc because risks of irreversible harm&#13;
from poverty-induced shortages of dietary energy are much greater among&#13;
under-fives than at later ages.&#13;
28.    "Dependency ratio" usually means "persons not aged 15-59, as a&#13;
proportion of persons aged 15-59". Sometimes "over 15" or "over 10"&#13;
replaces "15-59"; where this happens, it is stated. It makes little&#13;
difference to the overall relationships between poverty and the ratio.&#13;
Nor does the distinction between "family" and "co-resident household";&#13;
few households at risk of poverty have servants or lodgers.&#13;
29.    In 1973-4, children in rural Gujarat comprised 48.4% of rural&#13;
households with below 34 Rs/person/month; 45.5% at 34-43 Rs; 41.7% at&#13;
43-150 Rs; and 43.4% above 150 RB.   (This accords well with the 1972-3&#13;
data given by Visaria; only above the 6th deoile by inoome-per-person&#13;
did the ratio fall below 40%.)  For rural Haharashtra, the&#13;
corresponding data were 50.0%, 46.7%, 39.2% and 31.0%, and for rural&#13;
Rajasthan, 49.1%, 46.0%, 42,4% and 38.2%.   In urban Gujarat, 52.1% of&#13;
members of households spending below 34 Rs/person/aonth were ehildren;&#13;
46.0% at 34-43 Rs; 38.9% 43-150 Rs; and 24.1% at 150+.   For Maharashtra&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114&#13;
the corresponding figures were 50.9%, 44.6%, 36.6% and 19.2%, and for&#13;
Rajasthan, 49.1%, 50.9%, 40.2% and 21.9%. Caloulation by K. Affan from&#13;
NSS 28th Round (Oot. 1973-Sept. 1974, No. 240), pp. 11, 13, 81.&#13;
30.    Sarvekshana, Jan. 1979. For example, we found similar "reversals" for&#13;
rural Bihar (child/household ratio for households spending 0-13&#13;
Rs/person/month, 0.54 (2.0% of all 5739 sampled); 13-15, 0.48 (1.6%);&#13;
15-18, 0.50 (3.7%); and falls thereafter); Madhya Pradesh (at 0-13&#13;
Rs/person/month, a sample of 78 households oomprised 52% children; at&#13;
13-15 (sample of 115), 55%; and falls thereafter); and Punjab (0-13 Rs&#13;
- 10 households - 37%; 1-18 - 8 - 46%; 18-21 - 21 - 50%; 21-24 - 43 -&#13;
53%; 24-28 - 108 - 56%; and thereafter falls). Urban series usually&#13;
produced similar reversals. Cf. fn. 11.&#13;
31.    In PI-NDCs, when poorer people usually married later than others (pp.&#13;
24-6), the age of marriage would tend to push up the average age of&#13;
poor HHS, going against the other effects mentioned here and leaving&#13;
the upshot indeterminate.&#13;
32.    "A high proportion of babies aged 0-4 (in relation to adult women and&#13;
older children)" was found in the low-participation, but not&#13;
high-participation, villages in a 93-village Indian sample (from the&#13;
1960s), on the basis of principal component analysis (Dasgupta, 1977,&#13;
p. 157; my emphasis).&#13;
33.    (a) The coefficient of (age2) was negative (-.0052) but insignifioant&#13;
even at 10%. The MEP and income-per-head specifioations are here&#13;
preferred to those "per consumer unit" - oalled "standard inoome" by&#13;
Gaiha (p. 7) - beoause Gaiha follows a rather unusual set of CUs, which&#13;
weight children aged 0-1 at zero. (b) Significance levels oorreoted&#13;
from text (thanks to Gaiha, pers. comm.).&#13;
34.    Excluding under-fives in urban and rural Maharashtra only.&#13;
35.    Table 16 (p. 60) of Visaria, 1980, seems to be transcribed wrongly,&#13;
since it is not consistent wth the text (p. 58), the graphs (p. 61), or&#13;
the known facts, all three of which are oonsistent with one another.&#13;
Therefore, this paper uses pp. 58 and 61 and ignores p. 60.&#13;
36.    There are mild falls in urban Gujarat in 1972-3 (51% of males of all&#13;
ages in the poorest MEP decile,   47% in the richest); rural Maharashtra&#13;
(51% to 45%, but all the fall is in the top two deciles); peninsular&#13;
Malaysia (53% to 51%); and Taiwan (52% to 49%).&#13;
37.    Corresponding figures for urban GuJarat were muoh less unbalanoed&#13;
(respectively 109, and 117: Visaria, 1977, p. 8A). This suggests that&#13;
a national business and political centre, like Bombay, is especially&#13;
liable to the "exoessw presence, and influence, of wealthy and powerful&#13;
males. This was confirmed in 1972-3 in urban West Bengal (with its&#13;
national "centre" in Caloutta), a small female surplus in the poorest&#13;
homes, balance among the moderately poor, and a growing male surplus in&#13;
the top two-thirds; and also in urban Delhi (Sarvekshana, Jan. 1979,&#13;
pp. S360-7). Also, urban Nepal showed a similar pattern to Maharashtra&#13;
(Visaria, 1980, p. 61).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
115&#13;
38.    In most LICs, rural populations - normally defined as those In plaoes&#13;
with below 5,000 inhabitants - still form 75% or more of national&#13;
totals. Therefore, while sex-selective or age-seleotive migration&#13;
greatly alters the demographio structures of urban places, and of HBP&#13;
groups within them, the migrants are a muoh smaller proportion of rural&#13;
residents, and affeot rural struotures (total and in HEP sub-groups)&#13;
far less.&#13;
39.    Possibly the effect of female-headedness on relative HEP, even holding&#13;
civil status oonstant, is higher in middle-income aountries, where&#13;
poverty is muoh less extreme. In Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1972,&#13;
90.1% of 1908 sampled male HHs were married, as against 15.8% of 379&#13;
female HHs (158 one-person households were excluded); but the inoidence&#13;
of "poverty" was much higher among women of each civil status. 26 of&#13;
43 widowed women (2 of 6 men), 75 of 158 separated (9 of 32), 27 of 60&#13;
married (481 of 1720), and 42 of 118 single (30 of 150) were "poor".&#13;
But "poor" was defined as "monthly inoome-per-CU below 100 Cr." or $16&#13;
U.S. - far above the poverty-levels oonsidered in this paper. See&#13;
Merrik and Schmink, 1982.&#13;
40.    Less "inequitable"; but perhaps more "harmful", if poverty ooncentrates&#13;
in periods when a larger proportion of the household is vulnerable,&#13;
e.g. comprises under-fives. This is a good example of the risks of&#13;
applying diminishing-marginal-utility arguments to shifting&#13;
populationsl&#13;
41.    By timing, because surveys are harder to conduct when villages are less&#13;
accessible, i.e. usually in the wet season when food stores are&#13;
running low and the poor are poorer; by location, because&#13;
administrative convenienoe looates study areas near to towns and roads;&#13;
by procedure, because "household" surveys may miss many of the poorest,&#13;
who are transient migrants (mainly rural) or homeless (mainly urban).&#13;
Many relevant issues are summarized in Chambers (1980).&#13;
42.    Some construotions of the egalitarian case (e.g. Lipton, 1968, pp.&#13;
92-8) are based on assumptions (easily put into ordinalist language) of&#13;
diminishing marginal utility of the total value of commodities, plus&#13;
statistioal independence of initial real inoome from both entitlement&#13;
to, and enjoyment from, extra real income. "Everybody should be famous&#13;
for fifteen minutes" (A. Warhol). On the same assumptions, given&#13;
"total poverty", should everyone be poor for ten days? The answer has&#13;
to depend on whether it is "the same misery" and especially on when It&#13;
arrives in the life-span: see fn. 40.&#13;
43.    Some studies show, for example, income per person disaggregated in&#13;
different and non-oomparable ways from consumption per person, e.g. by&#13;
caste groups and occupation groups respectively. Others measure both&#13;
Income and consumption per household, so that (because householda with&#13;
high total inoome tend to be larger) we oannot be sure that if, say, a&#13;
low income-per-household group has a high excess of consumption over&#13;
income, it is also a "poor" group (low income per person) with,&#13;
therefore, low oapacity to borrow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116&#13;
44.    At rural outlay levels of Rs.34 per person per month in 1972-3, an NSS&#13;
"borderline" between groups of households, 80% of outlay spent on food&#13;
barely sufficed to meet 80% of the average Indian household member's&#13;
caloric needs. Not all persons in such households, however, were&#13;
ultra-poor: 48% of them (spending on average only Rs.29 per month in&#13;
1971-2) were children, with below-average needs (V. Patel, 1973,&#13;
Appendix, p. ix, Table 4), a larger proportion than in other households&#13;
(or. Table 2); and prices were then somewhat lower in the survey year,&#13;
1970-1, than in 1972-3.&#13;
45.    Because of the notorious problem of concealment of income, and because&#13;
consumption fluctuates less than income and is more likely to be&#13;
reported correctly in a brief survey, outlay indicators are preferable.&#13;
In poor households, however, concealment is normally much less, and is&#13;
partly offset by the tendency to adjust reports towards the local&#13;
average. It is, incidentally, arguable that welfare costs of work - or&#13;
at least caloric costs - should be deducted from income or outlay.&#13;
These questions are much more discussed, yet (in their impact on&#13;
measures and rankings of poverty) much less important, than the&#13;
choice-of-denominator problem on which we concentrate here.&#13;
46.    Indian NSS (1971-2) weights for estimating equivalent adult consumers&#13;
are: age 0-1, 0.43; 1-3, 0.54; 4-6, 0.72; 7-9, 0.87; 10-12, 1.03 male&#13;
(0.93 female); 13-15, 0.97 (0.80); 16-19, 1.02 (0.75); 20-39, 1.00&#13;
(0.71); 40-49, 0.95 (0.68); 50-59, 0.90 (0.64); 60-69, 0.80 (0.51);&#13;
70+, 0.70 (0.50). Taiwanese Bureau of Statistics (1974) weights: age&#13;
0-1, 0.3; 2-4, 0.4; 5-7, 0.5; 8-10, 0.7; 11-14, 0.8; 15-20, 0.9; 21+,&#13;
men 1.0, women 0.9 (Visaria, 1980, p. 200). Standard Lusk CUs&#13;
(Schofield, 1979, p. 14) are: 0-1, 0.3; 1-3, 0.4; 4-6, 0.5; 7-9, 0.7;&#13;
10-12, 0.8; 13-19, 1.0; 20., men 1.0, women 0.7.&#13;
47.    Often, we know the distributional data for a population's MEP and&#13;
outlay-per-CU only by group (e.g. ranked decile) means. In such cases,&#13;
given (i)-(iii) here, it is even less safe to infer, from (e.g.)&#13;
similar Gini coefficients by per-person and per-CU indicators, to&#13;
similar proportions in poverty by the two indicators.&#13;
48.    For example, households with several underemployed adults, but no&#13;
children, would be misclassified upwards by MEP (compared with outlay&#13;
per CU). Conversely, households in the lowest HEP deciles with high&#13;
child/adult ratios - but with children older than the nutritionally&#13;
vulnerable 0-5 age-group - could be misclassified downwards by MEP&#13;
(compared with outlay per CU).&#13;
49.    Hence large parts of extra food, given to children in nutrition&#13;
programs, are offset by reductions in their food at home - i.e.,&#13;
materialize mainly as extra income for adults in the same household&#13;
(Beaton and Ghasseimi, 1982).&#13;
50.    Similar arguments apply to analyses of poverty and undernutrition.&#13;
Probably, MEP sufficient, under stated assumptions, to buy 80% (not&#13;
100%) of the average food needs for persons (by age, sex and activity&#13;
groups) beat indioates absence of extreme, health-threatening&#13;
ultra-poverty - if the extent of such poverty is being used as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
117&#13;
criterion for allooating resources among areas or projeots (Lipton,&#13;
1983). Medical experts are, however, fully justified in objeoting to&#13;
any such criterion if the aim is to diagnose need at individual or&#13;
household level.&#13;
51.    Project or area ohoices, of course, depend also on severity of poverty&#13;
- not just on incidence. The Sen index can be shown, on highly&#13;
plausible assumptions, to be the only acceptable index to measure&#13;
"severity" and "incidence" together (Sen, 1981). However, its seoond&#13;
derivatives are completely counter-intuitive. Indication of&#13;
proportions of persons in "poverty" and "ultra-poverty", corresponding&#13;
to caloric risk (Lipton, 1983), may be a useful alternative approaoh.&#13;
52.    It is almost universally agreed to be true that, when a rich person&#13;
gives food to an ultra-poor person, the poor person's welfare gain is&#13;
somehow "more" than the rich person's welfare loss. Any theory&#13;
claiming that "problems", of measurement or otherwise, mean that we&#13;
"cannot" utter statements not scientifically refutable, and agreed by&#13;
almost all to be true, is a bad theory.&#13;
53.    "If comparisons of expenditure are to be used to measure ohild oosts,&#13;
then the households being compared must be equally well-off ... [Does&#13;
this mean] the parents', the children's, or some oomposite 'household&#13;
welfare'? Only the first olearly makes sense, since only the parents&#13;
are present both before and after the arrival of the ohild [so that] it&#13;
is possible to ask questions about the extra costs needed to maintain&#13;
their previous [level] of living": Deaton and Muellbauer, 1981, p.7.&#13;
54.    This prooedure would take care of economies of scale in oonsumption at&#13;
the same time as household-composition effects.&#13;
55.    Sir Dennis Robertson suggested this term, to exclude changes in levels&#13;
of well-being not related to eoonomic activity.&#13;
56.    The work in LICs on ESCs addresses itself to different questions.  For&#13;
example, Iyengar, Jain and Srinivasan (1969) enquire whether, for&#13;
speoific groups of oonsumer outlay (e.g. food), the sum of the&#13;
elasticities of expenditure with respeot to total outlay and to family&#13;
size is below unity. If so - if, say, a household that increases in&#13;
size and in total outlay by 25 peroent (so that outlay-per-person is&#13;
oonstant) raises food outlay by only 20 percent - economies of scale in&#13;
food oonsumption are inferred by the authors. This prooedure, due to&#13;
Houthakker and Crockett, implicitly assumes that ESCs would be zero if&#13;
all outlays rose by 25 percent under these circumstanoes. Thus zero&#13;
ESCs in our sense are assumed.&#13;
57.    Most US ECSs in transport are due to the oar as a "family good", and do&#13;
not apply to poor LIC families - the expeoted dietary energy cost of&#13;
walking is twice as high for two as for one. Reaoh-down olothing to&#13;
younger siblings is probably oomoner among the lowest-MEP 25% in LICs&#13;
than in the USA - but, sinoe clothing forms so small a part of the&#13;
food-dominated budgets of the Third World's poor, that soale-eoonomy&#13;
oan "bite" on only a small share of their outlay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
118&#13;
58.    Many surveys estimate household data by (say) monthly&#13;
outlay-per-household quintiles; divide each quintile's monthly outlay&#13;
by MHS in that quintile; and present the result as "MIP quintiles".&#13;
Sinoe (pp. 58-9) household-outlay rankings typioally assign 2 in 3&#13;
households - and persons - to different quintiles of households from&#13;
HEP rankings, this prooedure is quite unacceptable.&#13;
59.    This example is chosen so that both regions have the same numbers of&#13;
poor, but one a larger number of ultra-poor. The case for using an 80&#13;
percent rigure as an ultra-poverty out-off is explained in Lipton,&#13;
1983.&#13;
60.    The scale of the problem appears from some of the positive&#13;
relationships of MHS to landholding reported above (pp. 11-12). Floors&#13;
and ceilings should take account of total income per person (or per&#13;
CU), not land per household. Land reform is hard enough to push&#13;
through, without the needless handioap of widespread demographic&#13;
resentment.&#13;
61.    The two crises are to some extent alternatives.  If domestio food&#13;
growers are paid attractive prices for their food, which is then sold&#13;
oheap to consumers, the crisis is likely to be mostly fisoal (though&#13;
farm inputs could swell the import bill). If the cost to the State of&#13;
consumers' food subsidies is kept down by squeezing farm-gate prices of&#13;
food, then domestic production is hit, food imports rise, and the&#13;
orisis is likely to be mostly in the balance of payments.&#13;

            Demography and poverty
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            National samples and village studies
            examine the demographic characteristics of households at
            high risk of poverty. Study of the relationship between
            incidence of poverty and household size shows that, although
            high status groups tend to have bigger households, in low
            income countries big households tend to be poor. The paper
            discusses the factors involved over space and time: marriage
            age, fertility, family/household ratio, family complexity,
            and, to a lesser extent, differential mortality, migration,
            and life-cycle effects. In examining household structure,
            strong positive links with high child/adult ratios, weak
            negative links with age of household head, and very weak
            links with sex-composition are found. Scale-economies to
            household consumption may affect poverty risk. Many of these
            relationships weaken or vanish among the poorest, but strong
            implications for poverty measurement are supported.
            Per-person measures, or even better, per consumer unit
            measures, are recommended. Policy implications are somewhat
            unclear, but demographic assessment could improve the
            poverty impact of many types of government action.
