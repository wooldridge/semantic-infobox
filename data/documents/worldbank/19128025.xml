        BOX 1. EVOLUTION OF RURAL SANITATION PROGRAMS IN INDIA&#13;
&#13;
        Central Rural Sanitation Program (1986-98): The Central Rural Sanitation Program (CRSP) was GoIâ&#128;&#153;s first national rural&#13;
        sanitation initiative. It was launched in 1986 and focused on providing 100 percent hardware subsidy to generate demand&#13;
        for pour-flush toilets. Commensurate efforts to motivate toilet usage or promote technology options were absent (GoI 2008).&#13;
        CRSP failed to motivate or sustain sanitation coverage, and the Census of 2001 found that 78 percent of rural households in&#13;
        India practiced open defecation (Registrar General of India 2002). In light of its relatively poor performance, GoI restructured&#13;
        CRSP at the national level and launched TSC in 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Total Sanitation Campaign (1999-2012): TSC advocated a participatory and decentralized approach. It moved away from&#13;
        the infrastructure-focused approach of the earlier program and concentrated on promoting behavior change. Some key&#13;
        features of TSC include:&#13;
             â&#128;¢ A community-led approach with focus on collective achievement of total sanitation;&#13;
             â&#128;¢ Focus on Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) to mobilize and motivate communities towards safe sanita-&#13;
                tion;&#13;
             â&#128;¢ Minimum capital incentives only for Below the Poverty Line (BPL) households, post construction and usage. Later the&#13;
                program introduced post-achievement incentivesâ&#128;&#148;NGPsâ&#128;&#148;for local governments to achieve total sanitation;&#13;
             â&#128;¢ A flexible menu of technology options; and&#13;
             â&#128;¢ Development of a supply chain to meet the demand stimulated at the community level.&#13;

    can be highlighted here. Firstly, national performance                               which defers the goal of universal rural sanitation to the&#13;
    aggregates conceal significant disparities in performance                            year 2022. There is growing recognition that a â&#128;&#152;business as&#13;
    between states and districts that are implementing rural                             usualâ&#128;&#153; approach will not be sufficient to achieve this goal.&#13;
    sanitation initiatives under common national program                                 The monitoring system of the incentive program, NGP, is&#13;
    guidelines. Secondly, GoIâ&#128;&#153;s routine monitoring system is                             also being constantly improved through annual reviews of&#13;
    geared towards periodic tracking of inputs (budget spent)                            the selection procedure and guidelines (Box 2) to preserve&#13;

    program is an ODF India, focusing on construction of                                 to take the lead in changing their sanitation status.&#13;
    latrines and disbursement of financial allocations skews&#13;
    the incentives for implementers in favor of prioritizing                             To address the question of which processes drive district&#13;
    building of toilets rather than their use. Outcomes such as                          performance in rural sanitation, WSP, in partnership with&#13;
    ODF communities are tracked to a limited extent through                              the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MDWS),&#13;

    unanswered is: which service delivery processes are linked to                        in 21 states5 followed by this second round in 2011 which&#13;
    better performance?                                                                  covered 56 districts in 12 states. The target audience for this&#13;

    BOX 2. NIRMAL GRAM PURASKAR: EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE MONITORING SYSTEM&#13;
&#13;
    Effective monitoring is the backbone of a successful incentive program. It ensures that only those local governments that&#13;
    actually deserve the award are recognized, maintaining the integrity and prestige of the award as a whole. Based on the&#13;
    experience of operationalizing NGP, the incentive programâ&#128;&#153;s guidelines have been revised by GoI in successive years to&#13;
    strengthen the verification process. Some of the changes introduced in the verification process include:&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Collection of identification data for each respondent household; this can be voter identification, a ration card number,&#13;
           or other identification. This is done to ensure that the existence of that household within the boundaries of the applicant&#13;
           local government can be proven, if challenged;&#13;
        â&#128;¢ All NGP applicants are verified by independent survey agencies. To further strengthen the quality of verification, 30&#13;
           percent of the applicants qualifying for NGP are cross-checked by a team deputed from another state;&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Release of prize money in two installments such that the first installment is released immediately upon qualifying for the&#13;
           prize. The second installment is released after six months subject to qualifying in a re-verification of 100 percent ODF&#13;
           status; and&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Concurrent monitoring of the verification process by international agencies such as UNICEF, Water Aid and the Water&#13;
           and Sanitation Program (WSP) of the World Bank.&#13;

         BOX 4. GOIâ&#128;&#153;S ASSESSMENT OF NGP IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
&#13;
         DDWS launched a comprehensive study to assess the impact and sustainability of the NGP incentive program in 2010. The&#13;
         main purpose of the study was to assess the impact of NGP on sanitation coverage and usage and its related impact on&#13;
         health, education, gender empowerment, and social inclusion in rural areas on different user groups, particularly rural poor.&#13;
         This study also focused on the durability and sustainability of the provision and usage of sanitary facilities over time. The&#13;
         focus areas identified for the study were:&#13;
             1. Current Status of NGP criteria&#13;
                   1.1 Status of toilet coverage, durability and functionality.&#13;
                   1.2 Status of usage and Nirmal status (ODF and resolution, garbage disposal, and drainage systems).&#13;
             2. Impact and Hygiene&#13;
                   2.1 Impact on health, education, economics, gender, and social inclusion.&#13;
                   2.2 Relation of impact with status of hygiene practices.&#13;
             3. Sustainability of NGP Status&#13;
                   3.1 Critical factors for achieving NGP status.&#13;
                   3.2 Reasons for not building/using toilets among different target groups.&#13;
                   3.3 Factors critical for better sustainability of NGP status.&#13;
                   3.4 NGP award money utilization.&#13;
             4.    Measures and Modifications for Sustained NGP Status&#13;
                   4.1 Measures needed to strengthen the impact and sustainability.&#13;
                   4.2 Recommendations on whether to continue NGP and suggestions for improvement.&#13;

        According to TSC guidelines, a subsidy is intended as an incentive which may be given to BPL families if this is considered necessary for the complete involvement of the com-&#13;
     munity. The BPL family should undertake construction of the toilet on its own and a cash incentive may be given to it in recognition of its achievement. This indicator sought to&#13;
     verify whether the subsidy was, in fact, delivered as an incentive or whether it was diverted as an upfront unit cost to fund toilet construction for BPL households.&#13;
     15&#13;
        This indicator looked at potential errors of inclusion (households other than BPL households receive subsidy) and exclusion (BPL households eligible for the subsidy are left out)&#13;
     in targeting subsidy.&#13;

         â&#128;¢   The African Ministers Council on Water commissioned a first round of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) on water supply&#13;
             and sanitation in 2006 followed by a second round in 2009-10. The objective of the CSOs is to shed light on the factors&#13;
             that underpin progress in the sector and what member governments can do to accelerate progress. For each country&#13;
             (16 included in the first round and 32 in the second round), the CSOs explore the links between inputs (financing) and&#13;
             outcomes (service coverage) using a â&#128;&#152;scorecardâ&#128;&#153; to identify areas of progress and improvements in each sub-sector;&#13;

             service delivery approaches. EEAs are undertaken at two points in time: a baseline assessment at the start of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

             include high social capital, high-quality Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) triggering, access to latrine supplies, easy&#13;

         BOX 9. WHOSE TOILET? LACK OF HOUSEHOLD INVOLVEMENT IN SELECTING TOILET TECHNOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
         The TSC Guidelines state that an incentive can be given to a household to recognize its achievement of stopping open&#13;
         defecation. However, in practice, this amount is sometimes treated as a subsidy to construct a toilet rather than as an incen-&#13;
         tive to reward behavior change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         In one of the low scoring sample districts, a single offset leach pit, with slab and rural (high gradient) pan, is the model&#13;
         promoted for all households regardless of preference or geo-hydrological conditions. In addition to the incentive amount&#13;
         available under the program for BPL families, the district has made incentives available to APL families as well under the state&#13;
         policy. This â&#128;&#152;incentiveâ&#128;&#153; amount is treated as a unit cost or subsidy for constructing a household toilet. Accordingly, the toilet&#13;
         model promoted by the district is fit to the incentive/subsidy amount. This comprises a sub-structure and four walls of height&#13;
         up to 4 feet for both BPL and APL families, and every family is expected to install a door and a roof.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The district has extended financial support for five RSMs but none of these is functional. Even so, there are no difficul-&#13;
         ties reported in accessing sanitary products due to the existence of a well-established private market for most materials&#13;
         except for rural pans. Subsequently, the GP purchases all materials required for toilet construction locally; rural pans are&#13;
         procured by the district and made available through the sub-divisional office. The GP engages local masons and monitors&#13;
         the construction. Households play a minimal role in selecting the toilet model, engaging masons, and construction, and it&#13;
         was found that most did not invest in installing a door and a roof to complete the toilet sub-structure provided or, in fact,&#13;
         use the toilet constructed for them.&#13;

         BOX 10. PHASED APPROACH TO TSC IMPLEMENTATION IN RAIGAD DISTRICT, MAHARASHTRA&#13;
&#13;
         In Raigad, a high scoring district, phased take-up of GPs is based on the following three criteria: 1) relatively small GPs&#13;
         in terms of population; 2) at least a third of the households use toilets; and 3) positive outlook of elected representatives&#13;
         towards the rural sanitation program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Training is targeted at village health extension workers and elected representatives. A parallel initiative is the Swacchata Dhoot&#13;
         (sanitation ambassador) concept targeted at school teachers and selected students. The district follows a post-construction&#13;
         incentive system for households. The GP, in coordination with the school, is responsible for promoting safe sanitation through a&#13;
         community-led approach for achieving 100 percent ODF status. Utilizing other platforms such as the National Service Scheme&#13;
         in colleges, organizing exposure visits to GPs that have won the state sanitation prize (Sant Gadge Baba Gram Swachata&#13;
         Abhiyan award), training programs for masons, and organizing the Nirmal Raigad Neta Rath (Clean Raigad Leaders Rally) are&#13;
         allied initiatives. A strong political will to focus on sanitation is reported. The role of some members of the Zila Panchayat (ZP) in&#13;
         encouraging and ensuring support for rural sanitation is reported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     rather than spreading efforts too thinly by implementing                         environment and, moving beyond that, to waste manage-&#13;
     across all local governments at once (Box 10). Secondly,                         ment.&#13;

         BOX 11. SUBSIDY AS UNIT COST FOR SELECTING TOILET MODEL&#13;
&#13;
         The incentive available under the national rural sanitation campaign is supposed to be a reward for a family that stops open&#13;
         defecation and switches to using a toilet. It is not intended as a unit cost to cover the cost of constructing a toilet. In fact, a&#13;
         household can construct a toilet of its choice based on affordability and preference. However, since monitoring of outcomes&#13;
         is weak, the use of incentives as unit costs for constructing toilets persists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         In some sample districts that score low on the quality of processes and report weak outcomes, subsidy plays a key role in&#13;
         determining the choice of technology promoted. When the incentive/subsidy was ` 600 per toilet, districts instructed GPs&#13;
         to construct a direct single leach pit toilet fitted with a pan and trap and no superstructure. When the incentive/subsidy&#13;
         increased to ` 1,500, the model was modified to make the leach pit off-set from the slab. When the incentive/subsidy was&#13;
         again increased to ` 2,500, the structure was modified to include a junction box with provisions for an additional pit and four&#13;
         walls raised to a height of up to 4 feet.&#13;

    BOX 12. CROSS-VERIFICATION OF TSC MONITORING DATA&#13;
&#13;
    In one of the high scoring sample districts, it was found that TSC is monitored on a routine basis through monthly and quar-&#13;
    terly reviews at the district level. According to the Project Officer of the District Rural Development Agency, TSC and national&#13;
    livelihoods program are seen as flagship programs in the district.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Over and above the parameters specified for the online monitoring of TSC such as expenditure and toilet construction&#13;
    against targets, the district has also initiated its own verification of toilet usage, an indicator that is currently not tracked by&#13;
    the national routine monitoring system. This is based on cross-verification by teams comprising block officials and members&#13;
    of support organizations. Support organizations are NGOs engaged by the district to support community mobilization for&#13;
    rural sanitation. Cross-verification means that teams from one block visit local governments in another block in such a way&#13;
    as to avoid reciprocal verification. In other words, Block A team visits Block B, which in turn visits Block C. All 228 GPs in the&#13;
    district are covered in this exercise and the findings showed that usage of toilets is quite high and incidence of open defeca-&#13;
    tion varies from 2 to 16 percent across GPs.&#13;

    BOX 13. NON-MONETARY INCENTIVES: EXAMPLE OF DAKSHIN KANNADA DISTRICT IN KARNATAKA&#13;
&#13;
    In Dakshin Kannada district, the leadership has played a key role in motivating the staff to work on rural sanitation. No cash&#13;
    incentives are given but non-monetary recognition is highlighted through simple gestures such as recognizing change agents&#13;
    at public functions such as Republic Day celebrations, giving an opportunity to staff to lead and teach others, letters of&#13;
    appreciation from the district Chief Executive Officer, and an opportunity to be a part of the team that receives the NGP prize&#13;
    from the President of India in New Delhi.&#13;

                          1.1 STRATEGY FOR TSC IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
                             1. When was the TSC launched? Prior to the TSC, was there any rural sanitation program opera-&#13;
                                tional? If yes, what was the experience and results achieved?&#13;
                             2. Is TSC a departure from the way conventional rural sanitation programs are implemented? If&#13;
                                yes, how?&#13;
                             3. How are TSC Guidelines goals and approach interpreted? Is there a common understanding at&#13;
                                different levels of implementation from state to Panchayat?&#13;
                             4. What priority is given to TSC vis-Ã -vis other development programs? What is the approach to&#13;
                                TSC implementation? Does it follow the TSC Guidelines in letter and spirit?&#13;
                             5. What are the main challenges faced in implementing this strategy? Have there been any shifts in&#13;
                                the districtâ&#128;&#153;s approach to implementing TSC?&#13;
                             6. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this strategy? What recommendations would you&#13;
                                make to overcome any weaknesses?&#13;

                               1.2 INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AND CAPACITY&#13;
                                  1. Describe the institutional structure to implement and monitor the TSC at the following levels:&#13;
                                     â&#128;¢ District&#13;
                                     â&#128;¢ Block&#13;
                                     â&#128;¢ GP&#13;
                                     Ask: Who is responsible? What role/function do they play? What is their incentive to be involved&#13;
                                     with the TSC? Are named positions staffed? If not, why not, and since when?&#13;
                                  2. Is there a dedicated TSC cell within the nodal agency or is this shared with other departments/&#13;
                                     programs? How well is this cell functioning? In case the cell became redundant, what were the&#13;
                                     main reasons and how can these be overcome?&#13;
                                  3. How is staff inducted into the TSC? Are they on deputation or recruited from the open market?&#13;
                                     What training is given to newly appointed staff? Does TSC progress have any bearing on staff&#13;
                                     performance review? Are there any incentives/disincentives to deliver on TSC goals?&#13;
                                  4. Are any private contractors or NGOs hired to support implementation? What is their role?&#13;
                                  5. Is there coordination of the nodal agency with other linked line departments/agencies? How&#13;
                                     many coordination mechanisms are still active and how well are these working? If any coordina-&#13;
                                     tion mechanism failed to work, what were the key factors and how can these be addressed?&#13;
                                  6. In your opinion, are existing institutional arrangements adequate (in terms of staff, budget,&#13;
                                     capacity to implement, and so on) to meet the TSC goals within the program time frame?&#13;
&#13;
                               1.3 FINANCING&#13;
                                  1. What resources are available to implement the TSC in terms of:&#13;
                                     â&#128;¢ Financial allocations16&#13;
                                         Ask: Are fund flows predictable? Any bottlenecks or delays? How can these be overcome?&#13;
                                     â&#128;¢ Non-financial resources, for example, training institutions, cross-subsidy for TSC activities&#13;
                                         from other rural development programs, staff on deputation, and so on.&#13;
                                  2. What is the overall budget and breakdown of costs for implementing the TSC program?&#13;
                                     Does it cover ODF and other aspects of total sanitation, for example, Solid and Liquid Waste&#13;
                                     Management (SLWM)? Is this allocation adequate?&#13;
                                  3. Is fund flow consistent or are there bottlenecks? How can any bottlenecks be overcome?&#13;
                                  4. Are households mobilized to invest in their own toilet? How?&#13;
&#13;
                               COMPONENT 2: IMPLEMENTING&#13;
                               2.1 PROGRAM APPROACH TO CREATING DEMAND&#13;
                                  1. What is the process of creating demand in a GP:&#13;
                                     â&#128;¢ Who is the target audience at the community level? How was it identified?&#13;
                                     â&#128;¢ What are the main messages used in demand creation? How were these identified? Does it&#13;
                                        focus on collective or individual behavior change?&#13;
                                     â&#128;¢ What methods are used to create demand at the community level? How often? For example,&#13;
                                        Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools, house-to-house meetings, IEC tools (wall paint-&#13;

administrative functions to elected local bodies at village,              participatory principles, which seeks to achieve not only&#13;
block, and district levels. It is called a Gram Panchayatat               100 percent open defecation free (ODF) communities, that&#13;
the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the block level, and               is,all households have access to and use a functional toilet at&#13;

known as a Mukhiya or a Sarpanch (also see: Panchayati                    program of the GoI, a village is considered ODF only when&#13;

            Linking service delivery processes and
            outcomes in rural sanitation : findings from 56 districts in India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The year 2012 marked the close of the
            Government of India's (GoI's) Total Sanitation
            Campaign (TSC). The program was started in 1999 to achieve
            universal rural sanitation coverage. Although rural
            sanitation coverage has increased during TSC, progress still
            falls short of the program goal of universal coverage. The
            objectives of this assessment are to: provide GoI with an
            overview of the range of service delivery processes adopted
            by different districts across states and their relative
            performance in terms of outcomes; identify which service
            delivery processes are linked to better (or worse)
            performance; and identify where the key bottlenecks are to
            achieving or sustaining outcomes. In the first round of this
            assessment undertaken in 2010, six service delivery
            processes were identified as being critical for achieving
            sustainable rural sanitation outcomes at scale. In this
            second round, the number of processes assessed was increased
            to nine and grouped into three thematic components
            corresponding to the three stages in which the districts
            implement the program: catalyzing, implementing, and
            sustaining. Once this is in place, program implementation
            needs to focus on aligning operations to facilitate
            achievement of outcomes. Finally, the outcomes achieved must
            be sustained to achieve downstream impacts such as
            improvements in health and quality of life.
