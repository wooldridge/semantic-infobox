Abstract&#13;
The central purpose of the paper is to analyze various forms of&#13;
government intervention in the loan market in terms of their effect on&#13;
efficiency. This provides the essential basis for evaluating and judging&#13;
these policies. It also shows where earlier policy prescriptions are correct,&#13;
incomplete or wrong.&#13;
One of the implications of the paper is that the credit market&#13;
differs fundamentally from the market for ordinary goods and services.&#13;
Consequently conventional analysis of the loan markets, based on theory&#13;
applicable to these goods, can be misleading even when similar prescriptions&#13;
are reached. This is because the similarity may be restricted to special&#13;
circumstances. Another important highlight of the paper is the vital role of&#13;
collateral in the loan market. These two issues are addressed in the&#13;
introductory discussion on the special nature of credit markets, which forms&#13;
an important prerequisite for understanding the subsequent section and the&#13;
rest of the paper.&#13;
The selective literature review is designed primarily for readers&#13;
who require a bridge between the existing literature and the current model.&#13;
It therefore surveys the assumptions and limitations of these models and&#13;
indicates how the assumptions are made more realistic in the current model.&#13;
The reader uninterested in such details can skip this section without loss of&#13;
continuity.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF RESULTS&#13;
1.1 General Background and the Problem to be Addressed&#13;
Almost all countries have, or have had until recently, controls on&#13;
deposit and loan interest rates. In most developing countries and many&#13;
developed countries there are legal limits on maximum interest rates&#13;
chargeable in general or to special categories of borrowers. Where legal&#13;
limits do not exist, the same purpose has been achieved through informal&#13;
limits enforced by discount policy and other indirect methods.!' Governments&#13;
have also subsidized or enforced cross-subsidization of loan rates to&#13;
different categories of borrowers, different maturities of loans or for&#13;
different usage. A similar history exists for differential limits on credit&#13;
expansion and forced allocation of credit to different categories of&#13;
borrowers.!/&#13;
Even though there has been a tendency to reduce or eliminate such&#13;
intervention in developed countries, many forms of intervention remain. Such&#13;
intervention by developing country governments has increased considerably over&#13;
the past ten years. Table 1 gives an overview of the types of intervention&#13;
that have prevailed in twelve Asian countries.&#13;
Controls on deposit interest rates have been in widespread use and&#13;
remain so. These are thought to be a major cause of negative real rates as&#13;
illustrated by table 2.&#13;

On the loan side, many countries still subsidize export credit, some&#13;
like Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Korea, quite heavily. In Korea it&#13;
has been used as an active instrument of a policy for increasing exports.&#13;
This intervention appears to be prompted by a vague idea of increasing&#13;
competitiveness in international markets. In countries where governments have&#13;
played a major role in economic development, which is to say, almost all&#13;
countries classed as developing, Governments have tried to increase the flow&#13;
of bank loans for investment purposes. This has often been formulated as a&#13;
desire to increase the proportion of long term loans and to reduce that of&#13;
short term ones, and to limit the rates charged on the former.&#13;
As an illustration consider the case of the Philippines where loans&#13;
for a term of less than two years have a maximum effective rate ceiling of 16%&#13;
and those for a term of more than two years have a rate ceiling of 19%. Table&#13;
3 (last column) shows the approximate percentage of total loans which are&#13;
medium or long term.&#13;
The report from which table 3 has been taken has as one of its major&#13;
conclusions the reform of the financial system, "to increase the proportion&#13;
made available to borrowers on medium and longer terms". Both the proportions&#13;
are quite common in less developed countries.&#13;
In addition to the perceived link between investment and growth,&#13;
there is also a suspicion on the part of developing country governments of a&#13;
link between short term commercial loans and commodity speculation. The&#13;
latter is often linked further to supply of short term loans by informal&#13;
credit markets, where these exist, to wholesalers and other commercial&#13;
intermediaries. Through this association the entire role or usefulness of&#13;
informal credit markets is called into question, without a clear understanding&#13;
of what this role is.&#13;

Over the past decade there has been a great increase in LDC&#13;
government intervention in the credit market for agricultural loans and loans&#13;
to small-scale non-agricultural enterprises. In both cases (as in the&#13;
previous case of long-term loans), minimum credit allocation requirements are&#13;
usually combined with specification of maximum loan rates chargeable on such&#13;
loans. These interventions are often based on a vague suspicion on the part&#13;
of Governments that "not enough" loans are going to certain classes of&#13;
borrowers, to certain sectors and for certain purposes. The standard by which&#13;
too little" or "too much" is to be judged is often an arbitrary one; the&#13;
proportion of loans going to a particular sector should be roughly in&#13;
consonance with its share of economic activity or value-added. The case of&#13;
India illustrates this emphasis on so-called "priority sectors" for bank&#13;
lending. In a 1969 study the National Credit Council determined that too&#13;
large a proportion of credit was directed toward trade and industry! It&#13;
therefore recommended that a much greater proportion of credit be directed&#13;
toward priority sectors like agriculture, small scale industry and other small&#13;
entrepreneurs. Initially there was no target, but later a target was set at&#13;
33.3% of total credit to go to (all) priority sectors, and currently stands at&#13;
40% of total credit. Table 4 gives the position in 1969 and the changes since&#13;
then.&#13;

There is a wide variety of interest rates, all administratively set,&#13;
applicable to borrowers from these priority sectors. These depend on the size&#13;
of the borrower and/or the loan, among other factors. Small farmers can&#13;
borrow at rates ranging from 9.5 to 11%, and small entrepreneurs at 8 to&#13;
15.5%. This contrasts with loan rate ceilings of 18 to 19% for non-priority&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
In the case of agricultural credit there has long been a contention&#13;
and much debate in the literature,./ that monopolist lenders or landlords&#13;
extract surplus from peasants by charging high interest rates. Underlying&#13;
this view is a notion of fragmented and imperfect capital markets. Many&#13;
different, sometimes contradictory, explanations have been offered for this,&#13;
but it is not entirely clear why fragmentation is more acute in the credit&#13;
market than in the market for goods and services. More recently, the green&#13;
revolution in LDCs has refocused attention on the problem of credit&#13;
availability to small landholders and its effect on diffusion of technological&#13;
innovations.  The distribution of gains between borrowers and lenders, and&#13;
between small and large farmers, is often addressed by imposition of ceilings&#13;
on interest rates charged to agricultural borrowers.-/&#13;
The large organized firms are often thought to get too much credit&#13;
from the organized banking system at relatively low rates, at the expense of&#13;
small entrepreneurs. The amount of credit going to the large firms has often&#13;
sought to be restricted, sometimes on the grounds of concentration of&#13;
economic power or on distribution grounds. More recently, concern with&#13;
employment issues has brought the credit needs of small entrepreneurs more&#13;
directly into focus. It has also revived interest in informal credit markets&#13;
which appear to make a much larger proportion of their loans to small,&#13;
informal enterprises.&#13;

Three very broad underlying reasons for government intervention can&#13;
be discerned; these are first market failure or imperfections in the credit&#13;
market and the related question of distribution of gains between borrowers and&#13;
lenders. Second, market failure or imperfections in other markets which might&#13;
necessitate, or make it useful to, intervene in the credit market. And third,&#13;
broader economy wide questions of equity and divergence of social from private&#13;
optimality. The present paper will focus exclusively on the first of these&#13;
reasons. That is, what are the causes and consequences of market failure or&#13;
market imperfections in the credit market? What is the effect of different&#13;
government policies and different government interventions when such failures&#13;
and imperfections exist (and also when they are thought to exist but actually&#13;
don't)? This forms the basis for defining situations under which government&#13;
intervention may be justified and for evaluating different policies for&#13;
correcting such imperfections.&#13;
In examining credit markets it is useful to separate issues&#13;
concerned with the deposit side of the market from the loan side. The former&#13;
is concerned intimately with the important issue of incentives and&#13;
disincentives for savings. The present paper will not address this issue. It&#13;
assumes the deposit side of the market as given. On the loan side of the&#13;
market the paper does not directly consider the question of pure consumption&#13;
loans, though it has implications for this issue. The focus is on the&#13;
business loan market or loans for production (and distribution) purposes.&#13;
However loans to agricultural households, where it may not be possible to&#13;
distinguish between use for production and use for consumption, fall directly&#13;
within the purview of the paper.&#13;

1.2 Selective Review of the Literature&#13;
Given the long history of government intervention in credit markets&#13;
one might expect a vast literature on the optimality or non-optimality of&#13;
financial markets, the possible sources of inefficiency and the appropriate&#13;
policy responses. The literature is somewhat disappointing. It is based&#13;
essentially on two sets of opposing beliefs. The first set draws its&#13;
inspiration from the traditional neoclassical model.5/ In this view there is&#13;
no problem to be solved. If anything it is government intervention which&#13;
creates problems. If governments lift all restrictions, the market will&#13;
optimally allocate funds among different categories of borrowers. At the&#13;
other extreme is the   institutional  view,!' which posits that many less&#13;
developed countries are characterized by a feudal market structure and an&#13;
exploitative landlord tenant relationship extracts surplus from farmers&#13;
through  usurious   interest rates.  The only way to correct this situation is&#13;
to sweep away the credit and other institutions which give rise to it.&#13;
With respect to the developing countries the literature has&#13;
focussed, till quite recently, on rural credit markets and the question of&#13;
whether interest rates are 'too high and the reasons for this. An&#13;
institutional variation of the traditional neoclassical model postulates&#13;
highly fragmented credit markets that are, in effect, hundreds of isolated&#13;
markets each characterized by a traditional monopolist.!/ The issue then&#13;
becomes whether in each such sub-market there exist enough lenders to make the&#13;
market competitive. However the question remains why credit markets are more&#13;
fragmented than other markets, such as those for labor, output and urban&#13;
goods, as it would seem much easier to physically move funds around than these&#13;
other goods and services. If the answer is that all markets are fragmented&#13;
then one is led to the institutional solution of wholesale reform. If the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
answer is that, the other markets are not fragmented then one returns to the&#13;
problem, why credit markets are more monopolisticl8/&#13;
We will show subsequently that the credit market is a very unique&#13;
market and inherently different from markets for other goods. This tends to&#13;
produce situations which are neither 'competitive' nor 'monopolistic' but may&#13;
be characterized as a "competitive monopoly". This word is chosen in&#13;
preference to the usual monopolistic-competition because the market is&#13;
different in significant ways from typical conditions of monopolistic&#13;
competition.&#13;
Another variation of the traditional neoclassical model is to&#13;
introduce transaction costs of intermediation. Again intermediaries exist&#13;
between producers and consumers of virtually all goods, and it is not clear&#13;
why such costs should play a more important role in credit than in other&#13;
markets. In the context of lending to small enterprises however, differential&#13;
transaction costs provide a plausible explanation for differences in lending&#13;
patterns by informal and formal banks.2/ Informal banks are postulated to&#13;
have lower transaction costs on average in lending to smaller firms than&#13;
organized banks. This could result in a greater proportion, as compared to&#13;
the organized banks, of informal banks loans going to small enterprises. The&#13;
evidence on this is however inconclusive. The administrative costs for&#13;
lending by both types of banks to small firms seems to be approximately the&#13;
10/&#13;
same.-L The framework is extended to include bad debts or defaults as a&#13;
constituent of total transaction cost. With this extension, the evidence does&#13;
offer some support for the hypothesis that urban informal lenders and&#13;
organized commercial banks have different transaction costs for this given&#13;
category of borrowers.-1/ Opposing implications have however been drawn from&#13;
this analysis; the traditional neoclassical one is to allow both informal and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
formal markets to function without government intervention. The radical one&#13;
is for government to intervene to change administrative costs and default&#13;
risk, perhaps by trading off increases in the former with reductions in the&#13;
latter. The importance of this extension however lies in the valid concern&#13;
with differences in administrative costs plus riskiness across borrower-lender&#13;
categories even though risk is treated in a simplistic way 12/&#13;
A more realistic way of incorporating uncertainty about repayment of&#13;
principal and interest can be as proposed in Wai (1957) and Bottomley&#13;
(1975). A specified proportion (p), of the loan plus interest is assumed to&#13;
be repaid by the borrower. Alternatively one can assume that at the time the&#13;
loan is given, there is a probability (p) that the entire loan plus interest&#13;
will be repaid. The loan interest rate (r) must be such.that on an average&#13;
the returns to the lender must be greater than or equal to the opportunity&#13;
cost of funds, (i), plus the transaction costs (t), (which include returns to&#13;
capital and labor). In competitive equilibrium these must be equal i.e.&#13;
(1+r)L.p = (1+i+t)L, where L is the loan size. On manipulation this shows&#13;
that the loan interest, r can be written as&#13;
r = i + t + 1iP&#13;
p   p    p&#13;
which contrasts sharply with the previous simpler incorporation of the&#13;
possibility of default, as a risk premium (d) which is simply added on to the&#13;
interest rate and transaction cost (i.e. r = i+t+d). The new formula is used&#13;
(for rural credit markets), merely to calculate the expected competitive loan&#13;
rate of interest, and with some knowledge of actual rates to judge the&#13;
existence or extent of monopoly power. These are few policy implications for&#13;
the government except perhaps for government to encourage or establish bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
branches in the areas where monopoly is significant. However it is often&#13;
found that opening of such branches makes little difference to the terms and&#13;
amount of loans to most categories of borrowers who are the focus of&#13;
government interest. The reason for this will become clearer when the&#13;
competitive monopoly model is analyzed.&#13;
The literature recognizes that the volume of loan, borrower income&#13;
and its variability, the debt-equity ratio and collateral play a role in&#13;
determining the default rate (1-p).!3'    But the reason for this is unclear and&#13;
no attempt is made to incorporate them formally into analysis. The present&#13;
paper incorporates these into the analysis and illuminates their role in the&#13;
credit market. It also shows how problems like inadequate collateral affect&#13;
loan terms and amounts and may justify certain forms of government&#13;
intervention. The role of information about borrowers, in bank assessments of&#13;
the probability of default'L4/ and bank's subjective judgments about the&#13;
credit worthiness of particular borrowers151 is also alluded to in the&#13;
literature. It will be shown in this paper how bank subjective judgments&#13;
about returns and risk play a central role in the credit market. More&#13;
importantly it will also show what effect government policy intervention in&#13;
such situations have on the loan market.&#13;
We turn briefly to the literature which has arisen in the context of&#13;
developed country credit markets. The dominant issue in this literature has&#13;
been whether credit rationing can exist in free markets characterized by&#13;
rational profit maximizing banks.L6/    Borrowing is for either of two purposes,&#13;
what may be termed productive business, and financial investment. The latter&#13;
which includes borrowing for purchase of financial securities, bonds etc. in a&#13;
perfectly competitive market for such securities, is not of major importance&#13;
to LDCs and therefore need not be reviewed here. For productive business,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
where investment opportunities are specific to the borrower, only a special&#13;
type of borrowing is considered in which a fixed amount of investment K is&#13;
required.   Further the focus is on new investments.    It is assumed that the&#13;
returns from this investment are uncertain and that repayment varies&#13;
continuously with the realized returns, when returns are insufficient to&#13;
provide full repayment. This contrasts with the model reviewed earlier where&#13;
there were only two possibilities, full repayment or no repayment. Here&#13;
different amounts of repayment are possible, each having a probability&#13;
assigned to it. This is clearly more realistic. The literature concludes&#13;
that the supply curve of the lender for a borrower represented by such a&#13;
repayment schedule will be backward bending. The reasoning is that given the&#13;
fixed nature of the investment and the pattern of returns, there is a ceiling&#13;
on total repayment. Beyond a certain point a higher interest rate doesn't&#13;
lead to higher repayment and it does not pay the bank to give a larger loan.&#13;
From this the implication is drawn that if the demand curve of the borrower&#13;
lies entirely outside the supply curve, rationing will result.&#13;
Among the limitation of the fixed investment requirement is the&#13;
implicit assumption of fixed co-efficient production technology. It also&#13;
seems to exclude short term and commercial loans which form the major portion&#13;
of total bank loans even in developed countries. There is also an apparent&#13;
contradiction on the demand side. The credit rationing literature assumes&#13;
that the shortfall between the fixed capital requirement (K) and the loan (L)&#13;
is made up by firm equity contribution (E). That is E = K - Ls. However&#13;
after all the analysis, it is assumed that the loan demand curve can&#13;
arbitrarily lie outside it and the firm's equity is greater than desired by&#13;
the owner (s) i.e.     E &gt; K - LD   where sub-scripts D and S represent demand&#13;
and supply. This implies that the equity market is imperfect and that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
firm expects the bank to make a commitment greater than the owner(s) feels is&#13;
optimal for himself. The basic problem is that not only loan supply but also&#13;
loan demand must depend on the uncertain return from the project.17/ Most&#13;
papers also either implicitly assume a monopolist lender, or leave the entire&#13;
market structure on the loan side unclear. Finally, the papers do not say&#13;
anything about the optimality or efficiency of the market and the effects of&#13;
government intervention in the market. All these issues will be dealt with in&#13;
the present paper.&#13;
In analysing loans for financial investment, Azzi and Cox (1976)&#13;
consider the role of equity and collateral in credit markets which is not&#13;
explicitly considered in earlier models. They introduce collateral into the&#13;
model as a price like variable similar to the loan interest rate. In effect,&#13;
both collateral and firm equity affect the    quality   of the loan from the&#13;
perspective of the lender.i-! In the market for business loans considered in&#13;
the present paper, this may be true for equity. However collateral has a much&#13;
more complex role, that of equilibrating the market, and is therefore&#13;
intimately linked to the question of competition and degree of monopoly. 19/&#13;
Finally, Jaffee and Russell (1976) develop a model of the consumer credit&#13;
market which explicitly considers the inability of the lender to distinguish&#13;
between honest and dishonest borrowers or alternatively between higher and&#13;
lower income borrowers. They show that a competitive market will either be&#13;
heavily rationed or will be unstable. They hypothesize that instability may&#13;
be eliminated through the emergence of a monopoly. In the present paper we&#13;
will also consider these problems in the context of a business loan market,&#13;
and show that a stable non-rationed market can exist, but is likely to be&#13;
inefficient. This leads naturally to the question of alternative government&#13;
policies to correct the situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
1.3 The Special Nature of the Credit Market&#13;
It is useful to start a discussion of the credit market by looking&#13;
at the traditional neoclassical model of the competitive economy which&#13;
underlies most analysis. The market for funds is conceived to be like the&#13;
market for any good or service, with the supply of savings constituting the&#13;
supply curve for loans, and the demand for funds for investment and&#13;
consumption purposes constituting the demand curve for loans. There is no&#13;
explicit role for financial intermediation, as the market smoothly transfers&#13;
funds from savers to investors and consumers.&#13;
Intermediaries do exist between producers of goods and the ultimate&#13;
consumers. One way they have been explicitly considered, is by imagining a&#13;
good at the producers location as a different one from that available to the&#13;
consumer. Wholesalers, retailers etc are then seen as transforming goods from&#13;
one form into another. For most purposes this is a reasonably satisfactory&#13;
solution where ordinary goods and services are concerned. For a bank, acting&#13;
as a financial intermediary, and receiving deposits and making loans at the&#13;
same location, or costlessly transmitting funds between different branches,&#13;
this seems a patently contrived solution. It does however alert us to the&#13;
fact that there are really two markets here, not one as postulated by the&#13;
simple savings-investment model. On one side is the market for deposits, with&#13;
a supply curve given by the traditional savings side of the market, and a&#13;
demand curve constituting the demand for loanable funds by banks. On the&#13;
other side is the market for loans, with a supply curve depending on banks and&#13;
a demand curve aggregated over individual borrowers.2!/&#13;
There is a fundamental difference between either of these two&#13;
markets for funds, and the corresponding market for a good. In any goods&#13;
market there is a simultaneous exchange of value; the payment for the good is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
made at the same time as the supply of the good-21!     It is a fundamental&#13;
feature of the credit market, that the payment for the 'good' is made at a&#13;
later date than that at which the 'good' is supplied-22/     On the deposit side&#13;
of the market, the good consists of the savings or other deposits and the&#13;
payment consists of interest plus principal. On the loan side the 'good' is&#13;
the loan amount the repayment is the principal plus interest. In both cases&#13;
the good is exchanged for a commitment, to pay a specified sum or sums in the&#13;
future.  Clearly the actual realization of the commitment depends both on the&#13;
ability and the intentions of the individual or firm making the commitment.&#13;
Uncertainty about both these aspects therefore plays a fundamental role in the&#13;
credit market.23/&#13;
To illustrate this from the deposit side of the market we have to go&#13;
back to an era before central bank chartering and monitoring of banks and of&#13;
public deposit insurance corporations. Depositors' uncertainty about a bank's&#13;
ability to repay clearly had an influence on their willingness to deposit&#13;
money, with the phenomenon of a 'run on a bank' arising when their judgment&#13;
changed. Such uncertainty, particularly the possibility of a bank (or banks)&#13;
going bankrupt can exert a strong influence on the supply curve of savings.&#13;
In poor underdeveloped countries where banking institutions are not well&#13;
established, savings may still be influenced by such uncertainty. However as&#13;
this is not the focus of our analysis, we return to the loan side of the&#13;
market.&#13;
Assume for the moment that all actual and potential borrowers are&#13;
perfectly honest and fully intend to repay the loan if they are able to. That&#13;
is, there are no questions about the intent to repay the loan (or pay for the&#13;
'good'). Assume also that there are a large number of identical banks,24/ so&#13;
that there are no problems of monopoly or oligopoly. Because each borrower's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
return from productive activity and, consequently, his ability to repay is&#13;
different, there must be a different supply curve for each borrower. In the&#13;
neoclassical goods market the identity of the sellers or the buyers is of no&#13;
relevance to the transaction.1k' All that matters is that the former have a&#13;
good to sell and the latter the means to pay for it. In the credit market&#13;
there is no simple market supply curve for loans but a number of individual-&#13;
specific supply curves. For practical purposes we may lump together a number&#13;
of potential borrowers with approximately similar pattern of returns and&#13;
repayment ability. For simplicity assume that within a class the borrowers&#13;
are identical, so that borrowers can be divided into a (smaller) number of&#13;
classes. Assuming further that within each class there are a large number of&#13;
borrowers, it is reasonable to talk about a supply curve for loans to this&#13;
class of borrowers and a demand curve from these borrowers. However, it is&#13;
still more fruitful to think in terms of a representative bank's supply curve&#13;
for a single representative borrower and that borrower's demand curve. This&#13;
is because, ultimately the loan transaction is between a specific bank and a&#13;
specific borrower, and we are less likely to loose sight of the many&#13;
assumptions made in the process of going from this to aggregative supply and&#13;
demand curves for the class.&#13;
From this point it is useful to focus on the nature of business&#13;
loans. The borrower in this case is a firm, be it an incorporated firm or an&#13;
unincorporated entrepreneur or trader. The loan is to be used directly for&#13;
production or trade (as distinct from financial investments), the returns from&#13;
which are uncertain. These returns depend inter alia upon the nature of the&#13;
productive activity, the capital required, the industry in which the firm&#13;
operates, and the ability of its managers. Other characteristics of the firm,&#13;
such as invested equity, affect the prospects of loan repayment, for any given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
realization of returns to the firm. Thus for example, of two firms which&#13;
ended up with the same returns, the one with higher equity would have greater&#13;
capacity to repay the loan. In analyzing the loan market it is useful to&#13;
adopt the partial equilibrium approach in which we take all other&#13;
factors/characteristics as given while determining the factors endogenous to&#13;
the market. The loan amount (L) and the loan interest rate (r) are obviously&#13;
two such variables. The third most vital variable, which is often neglected,&#13;
is collateral (C), and this plays a role unique in the credit market.&#13;
To appreciate this role of collateral consider a hypothetical&#13;
situation in which collateral value, C, completely covered the value of the&#13;
loan plus interest, that is (1+r)L = C.26/ This market would be essentially&#13;
indistinguishable from a goods market because, in effect there is a&#13;
simultaneous exchange of goods of equal value. Uncertainty about the returns&#13;
to the firm from productive activity and its ability to repay would become&#13;
irrelevant to the loan market.Z./ Practical observation of both informal and&#13;
formal credit markets shows that loans are often made without any collateral&#13;
at all. Typically there are various amounts of collateral taken, with perhaps&#13;
the complete coverage case occuring occasionally at the other extreme. The&#13;
very fact that uncertainty about the variables mentioned earlier plays a vital&#13;
role in the credit market suggest that collateral must be only one of the&#13;
variables constituting the terms of the equilibrium loan contract between the&#13;
firm and bank.&#13;
To understand the precise role of collateral in the loan market one&#13;
must re-examine the nature of competitive equilibrium in a single goods&#13;
market. This market is characterized by a supply schedule in which the&#13;
quantity supplied is a function of market price, and a demand schedule in&#13;
which quantity demanded is a function of the market price. Equilibrium is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
defined as the intersection of the two curves, or the single price at which&#13;
quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. Competitive equilibrium however&#13;
entails something further. It is recognized that at the demand-supply&#13;
equilibrium there may be positive 'pure profits'. Competitive equilibrium&#13;
requires that existing firms (or at least the marginal firm), earn zero&#13;
profit. This is brought about by the entry and exit of firms, which shifts&#13;
the supply curve to the right or left at each price as the total supply is&#13;
correspondingly increased or reduced. In the loan market, for any given value&#13;
of collateral, we can similarly obtain a supply locus relating loan supply to&#13;
the loan interest rate, and a demand locus relating loan demand to the&#13;
interest rate. As before, for any given collateral, equilibrium is defined as&#13;
the intersection of the two curves. At first sight the collateral value&#13;
appears to be indeterminate, as long as it lies between zero and the value of&#13;
loan plus interest, as, for each such value we have an equilibrium. However,&#13;
even in the extreme case in which there are several identical firms and&#13;
several identical banks, the loan transaction is ultimately a transaction&#13;
between one firm and one bank. In this situation as long as the number of&#13;
banks is 'high enough' so that they act as 'perfect competitors' a change in&#13;
the number of banks has no effect on the amount a given bank is willing to&#13;
loan to the particular firm, at the announced interest rate and collateral&#13;
value, i.e. there is no shift in the supply curve for the given firm or for&#13;
any other firm from the class. A change in the collateral value, however,&#13;
does shift the supply curve, and also changes the expected profits of the bank&#13;
making the loan.18/ Competitive equilibrium can then be conceived off as&#13;
being established by changes in the collateral value which result in zero&#13;
expected profits for the bank making the loan. At this point no competing&#13;
(identical) bank can offer better terms, for this would entail expected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
losses. In other words there is a unique value of the loan interest rate and&#13;
collateral value for which the market is in competitive equilibrium (given the&#13;
usual types of assumptions needed to ensure uniqueness of equilibrium).&#13;
As the question of monopoly in credit markets has played such an&#13;
important role in the literature on LDC credit markets we must consider how a&#13;
monopolistic loan market differs fundamentally from monopolistic goods&#13;
markets. Maintaining all earlier assumptions except that there is now only&#13;
one bank in a region. This bank has access to the urban or foreign capital&#13;
market so that it faces a perfectly elastic supply of deposits (it is still a&#13;
competitor on the deposit side of the market). The previous analysis suggests&#13;
that the traditional diagram of monopoly in the goods market is not&#13;
applicable.29/ It has already been noted that there are many values of&#13;
collateral at which demand and supply loci intersect, and one such&#13;
intersection constitutes the competitive equilibrium. This suggests that&#13;
another such equilibria may be the monopoly equilibrium 30/ One can think of&#13;
collateral as a transfer of value from the bank to the firm. This not only&#13;
increases the expected profits of the bank making the loan, but&#13;
correspondingly reduces the expected profits of the firm. If one starts from&#13;
the competitive equilibrium value of collateral, as defined earlier, and&#13;
increases it, eventually there would be a point at which the borrowing firm's&#13;
expected profits would be reduced to an amount which it would make even&#13;
without taking the loan (say P ). A marginal increase in collateral would&#13;
mean an expected net loss to it from taking the loan, and its demand for loans&#13;
would then be zero. The point of equivalence represents the loan terms at&#13;
which the bank is making the greatest possible profits from the loan&#13;
transaction (with the given firm), and this can be defined as the monopoly&#13;
equilibrium. lWe will show later that the degree of monopoly or oligopoly can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
be directly related to an index which increases linearly with collateral, with&#13;
a zero value representing perfect competition and a value of one representing&#13;
complete monopoly. In the simplified framework outlined the loan interest&#13;
rate will be shown to increase monotonically with the degree of monopoly.&#13;
Differential Expectations&#13;
We have implicitly assumed that there is some 'objective' view of&#13;
the uncertainty of returns to the firm from the productive activity, which is&#13;
shared by the bank and the firm. This in turn implies a shared view of the&#13;
likelihood (or probability) of full repayment, partial repayment or no&#13;
repayment except for the collateral value which is certain. In general this&#13;
is not true; we can expect different participants to make different judgments&#13;
about the likelihoods even if they had the same information. As an&#13;
illustration consider the differing judgments about future inflation made by&#13;
different financial and economic experts having the same basic economic&#13;
information. In less developed countries, where information flows are much&#13;
less smooth than in developed countries subjective judgments are even more&#13;
likely to differ. For simplicity we initially make the assumption that all&#13;
the competitive banks have identical expectations regarding repayment by the&#13;
firm but that these are different from-the expectations the firm itself has&#13;
about the likelihood of its repaying fully, partially, etc. We term this the&#13;
differential expectation case, and assume that the banks are more pessimistic&#13;
than the firm in that they expect a lower mean value of returns from the&#13;
productive activity, than does the firm. 91/ This in turn implies that the&#13;
banks' judgment of the expected value of what will be repaid is less than what&#13;
the firm judges it will have to repay in expected value terms.32/    It will be&#13;
shown in chapter IV that this introduces an imperfection in the market which&#13;
reduces the loan size below the optimal and increases the loan interest rate:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
The loan supply curve, as defined earlier, is shifted to the left along the&#13;
demand curve.33/ This suggests that appropriate intervention may correct the&#13;
situation. A range of typical government policy options are analyzed in&#13;
chapter IV.&#13;
To understand the reason, it may be helpful to look at the simple&#13;
model reviewed in section 1.2. In this model there are only two&#13;
possibilities; full-repayment with probability (p) and no repayment. Recall&#13;
that there is no collateral in this model and p is completely exogenous. The&#13;
loan interest rate (r) in that case was shown to be r = ipt + 1pP where i is&#13;
p     p&#13;
the deposit interest rate and t the transaction cost. If the banks are&#13;
pessimistic in this case, it implies that the probability of full repayment&#13;
(p) is assumed by the banks to be lower than the actual value (or the realized&#13;
proportions). From the formula it is easily seen that the loan interest rate&#13;
(r) is higher than it should be. Given a downward sloping demand curve this&#13;
would result in a lower than desirable loan size. An analogy relating to&#13;
inflationary expectations is given in footnote 31 to illustrate the same&#13;
issue.&#13;
Differences in Expectations among Suppliers&#13;
Finally we can drop the assumption that all banks have identical&#13;
expectations or judgments regarding the returns to and repayment by the firm&#13;
under consideration. Let us order the banks, with the least pessimistic,&#13;
(when compared to the firms expectations in the sense defined earlier) first&#13;
and the most pessimistic last. Clearly no bank will make a loan to the firm&#13;
on terms (r,C) at which expected profits are negative. Bank number 1 is able&#13;
to offer the best terms, bank number 2 the second best and so on (chapter&#13;
V). The greater the relative bank pessimism the higher the interest rate.&#13;
Even accounting for differences in collateral required, the' terms that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
more pessimistic bank can offer will be worse in the sense that the firm's&#13;
expected profits are lower. Imagine all these banks competing against, each&#13;
other to obtain this firm's business. Now suppose that bank 2 offers the best&#13;
loan terms (r,C) that it possibly can (its expected profits are zero at this&#13;
point). Given the firm's demand curve, there is an equilibrium value of loan&#13;
size at these terms and an associated value of expected profits for the firm,&#13;
say  P       Banks 3 to n cannot offer better terms than these because this&#13;
would imply negative expected profits for them. Bank 1 can offer better&#13;
terms. To attract the firm, all it needs to do is to offer marginally better&#13;
terms, which imply a marginally greater expected profit for the firm than&#13;
P' . It does not need to offer the best possible terms that it can. There is&#13;
in effect an element of implicit monopoly profits accruing to the bank.&#13;
However these profits are not in general merely short term profits. Unlike&#13;
monopolistic-competition in the goods market, they do not depend on cost&#13;
differences or on wrong perceptions about how other sellers will react. They&#13;
are linked directly to the different expectations of the banks 34/ The&#13;
equilibrium loan terms are similar in form to the monopoly terms in that they&#13;
enable Bank 1 to extract the maximum surplus, given the constraint that the&#13;
firm has the option of switching to Bank 2 and making profit P' (In a pure&#13;
monopoly the only alternative is to not take the loan). That is why we term&#13;
this market a competitive-monopoly235/ This is the general model, and it can&#13;
be shown that the competitive equilibrium (and 'monopoly' equilibrium) is a&#13;
special case of this.-36/ It should also be noted that in the case of an open&#13;
economy, that in general, one or more banks could be foreign banks.&#13;
Because the focus of this analysis is on government policy, with&#13;
specific reference to the policy instruments that have been used historically,&#13;
we have taken the expectations of the participants as given. However to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
draw out the full implications of the model it is useful to look at the&#13;
information flows that underlie these expectations. In deriving these&#13;
implications we will often make the assumption that the closer are the&#13;
information links between a firm and a bank the smaller is the gap between&#13;
their respective expectations about the productive activity for which the loan&#13;
is taken. There are two aspects to these information links. The most obvious&#13;
is that flows of information will depend on the channels of communication,&#13;
including personal contacts, and on the judgment by the bank of the&#13;
reliability of such channels. The second aspect is the bank's interpretation&#13;
of whatever information is received. This in turn depends on the expertise&#13;
(knowledge) of the bank and the firm and the similarity and differences in&#13;
their general experience and outlook. As an illustration, consider a lender&#13;
who in the past (or at present) operated as a firm in a particular industry,&#13;
or alternatively has many friends and relatives operating in this industry.&#13;
We would expect his information links with the industry to be strong. The&#13;
same would be true if he has done a lot of lending to firms in this&#13;
industry. On a firm specific basis we would expect a lender who has dealt&#13;
with a potential borrower as a supplier of inputs, buyer of output or belongs&#13;
to the same caste or kin group to have stronger information links with this&#13;
borrower.37/ A similar result would follow if the lender has dealt with the&#13;
potential borrower as a depositor or has provided him with other banking&#13;
servicesA38/&#13;
The analysis of this paper suggests that if market 'fragmentation'&#13;
is important in LDC credit markets it is this fragmentation in the flow and&#13;
interpretation of information which is at the root of it. Though these&#13;
information problems may play a role in goods and service markets they have a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
much more important role in credit markets because information and&#13;
expectations are fundamental to the lending process.39/&#13;
It has been assumed, so far, that the borrowing firm's intentions&#13;
are perfectly above-board and honest. It is obvious to anyone familiar with&#13;
bank operations that judgments about the ability of the firm are supplemented&#13;
by those about its sincerity. The special problems which arise, and which are&#13;
not present in the goods market,40/ can be illustrated by a simple case in&#13;
which there are two types of firms: one perfectly honest and the other&#13;
completely dishonest. It never pays the latter to repay the loan as long as&#13;
collateral is less than principal plus interest. On the other hand for the&#13;
honest firm the optimal collateral is in general less than the principal plus&#13;
interest. The problem can then be framed as an inability by banks to&#13;
distinguish between the two types of firms in a given class of borrowers. The&#13;
banks have some judgment about the proportion of honest firms in the class or&#13;
the probability that any given firm is honest. Compared to a hypothetical&#13;
situation in which honest borrowers could be perfectly distinguished the&#13;
actual equilibrium is one in which these borrowers receive smaller loans at&#13;
higher interest rates. The expected profits of the bank from dishonest&#13;
borrowers are negative. This means that the average repayment per borrower,&#13;
all coming from the honest borrowers, is reduced so that the supply curve for&#13;
loans shifts to the left. From a slightly different perspective the presence&#13;
of dishonest borrowers imposes a negative externality on honest borrowers&#13;
whose expected profits are consequently reduced. In the extreme case in which&#13;
the banks feel that the proportion of honest borrowers is too low, the terms&#13;
become so bad that they drive out the honest borrowers completely, and no&#13;
loans are made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
Information problems are an important feature of the credit&#13;
market. In addition to the inability to distinguish between honest and&#13;
dishonest borrowers, banks have difficulty in distinguishing between more -&#13;
and less - productive borrowers, more and less risky borrowers, and between&#13;
use of loan for production or consumption purposes (as in agricultural&#13;
households). In each case the loans are supplied on terms which are an&#13;
average of the two types which results in worsening the terms to and harming&#13;
the more profitable (from the banks' perspective). There are ways of&#13;
correcting some of these problems where the social benefit exceeds the private&#13;
benefit, so that government intervention is desirable and necessary as is&#13;
shown in chapters VI and VII.&#13;
1.4 Summary of Results and Implications&#13;
The paper provides a unified framework for analyzing credit markets,&#13;
and allows apparently disparate observations and facts in the banking and&#13;
institutional literature to be understood and interpreted. More importantly&#13;
it provides a unique framework for determining the effect of government policy&#13;
on credit market efficiency.&#13;
The paper starts by making as many simplifying assumptions as&#13;
possible without eliminating the basic features of the market. In suceeding&#13;
chapters these assumptions are relaxed one by one to see the effect on market&#13;
equilibrium. In each case an attempt is made to draw out the many&#13;
implications of each result, to analyze policy implications and to judge the&#13;
usefulness of government policy intervention. Before summarizing the results&#13;
it is necessary to provide some definitions. The borrower (referred to as the&#13;
firm) is assumed to borrow funds from the lender (referred to as the bank) for&#13;
productive purposes. The returns from this productive activity is&#13;
uncertain. The firm and all banks have some subjective judgment or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
expectations about the pattern of this uncertainty (the probability&#13;
distribution of returns). We will say that the banks have more pessimistic&#13;
expectations than the firm when the mean value they ascribe to these uncertain&#13;
returns is less than that ascribed by the firm. Variance or spread may also&#13;
differ in certain ways but this is not important in the present context. Put&#13;
differently, the banks' judgment of the firm's productivity is less than the&#13;
firm's own judgment about its productivity. "Identical expectations" means&#13;
that the firm and all banks have the same judgment-A-Y Differential&#13;
expectations are defined to mean that the given firm's judgment is different&#13;
from the banks', but all the banks have the same judgment 42/&#13;
In chapter III, it is shown that in an efficiently functioning&#13;
credit market the expected marginal product from the use of a loan must equal&#13;
the opportunity cost of funds, earlier called the deposit interest rate (i),&#13;
to the lender plus the marginal costs variable part of transaction cost, (t)&#13;
of transferring these funds to the firm. Interestingly, neither of these need&#13;
be equal to the loan interest rate (r). Contrary to the popular conception&#13;
the loan interest rate is not the sole cost of the loan to the borrower. The&#13;
cost or price of the loan has two dimensions, comprised of the loan interest&#13;
rate and the collateral. 43/ The above efficiency condition can be used&#13;
directly to determine whether any firm or group of firms is getting the&#13;
'right' amount of loan (if i and t can be determined). Associated with this&#13;
condition is the optimal loan size.    It is shown that this is independent of&#13;
the fixed elements of the bank's and the firm's transaction costs, the degree&#13;
of uncertainty and the degree of monopoly-!      The last only effects the&#13;
distribution of gains between bank and firm or their relative gains from the&#13;
loan transaction.   The reason for this is that given identical expectations,&#13;
both participants agree that this generates the greatest expected surplus for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
division between repayment and firm profits. If both bank and firm have&#13;
identical expectations but are over-optimistic compared to some 'true' value,&#13;
this can mean that a loan transaction takes place when it shouldn't 45/&#13;
Similarly if they are both too pessimistic no loan may be given when it&#13;
should.46/&#13;
In a competitive equilibrium with identical expectations the loan&#13;
interest rate is shown to be inversely related to the firm's equity. If the&#13;
firm's owner(s) recognizes this link between his (their) equity in the firm&#13;
and his (their) loan terms, and carries out a simultaneous determination of&#13;
his (their) equity contribution and loan demand, the equity decision is also&#13;
efficient whether or not a perfect equity market exists. However, the&#13;
assumptions of identical expectations and risk neutrality limit the generality&#13;
of this result. It is possible to define a category of prime borrowers for&#13;
whom the equilibrium collateral value is zero. These are likely to be the&#13;
least risky and most well established customers, which have the lowest&#13;
transaction costs. The interest rate charged to these borrowers sets a lower&#13;
limit on interest rates; The bank should not be expected to charge a lower&#13;
rate to any other customer, if allocational efficiency in the credit market is&#13;
to be obtained.&#13;
The monopoly case presents two noteworthy differences. An increase&#13;
in the firm's equity, or a decrease in the opportunity cost of funds to the&#13;
market, does not lead to better terms for the firm. It merely brings about an&#13;
adjustment in the loan rate and collateral demand, with the expected profits&#13;
of the firm remaining unchanged. This is because the monopolist is able to&#13;
extract any surplus generated by the loan transaction whatever the exogenous&#13;
conditions. This offers some support for the suspicion in the institutional&#13;
literature that the existence of complete monopoly reduces the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
incentive to introduce technical innovations with large minimum capital&#13;
requirements (K). For those whose available equity is less than this&#13;
requirement, there would be virtually no incentive to make such an investment&#13;
as almost the entire surplus would go to the monopoly bank.47/&#13;
Chapter IV considers the "differential expectations" case, in which&#13;
the firm's expectations can differ from those of the banks. This is shown to&#13;
lead to inefficiency. If the banks are more pessimistic than the firm, the&#13;
supply locus shifts adversely along the demand locus so that the loan interest&#13;
rate is higher and the loan amount lower than optimal. Other things being&#13;
equal, the greater the degree of monopoly,48/ the higher the interest rate and&#13;
collateral requirements. The loan amount is no longer independent of the&#13;
degree of monopoly. There are two cases: the conventional case, consistent&#13;
with traditional analysis, in which the loan size decreases with degree of&#13;
monopoly (so that the existence of monopoly causes efficiency); and the&#13;
unconventional case, in which the opposite happens.&#13;
In competitive equilibrium, the greater the banks' degree of&#13;
pessimism relative to that of the firm, the greater the degree of&#13;
inefficiency, and the lower the expected profit of the firm.49/ If this&#13;
difference is large enough, it is possible for the loan terms to become so&#13;
adverse that the expected profit of the firm becomes lower than it would be in&#13;
the absence of any loan transaction. No such transaction will then take&#13;
place, and the loan market will cease to exist for the firm or the class of&#13;
firms. This result is independent of the 'true' productivity of the firm: it&#13;
depends only on the difference between the firm's and the banks' judgment.&#13;
Thus, some categories of firms may be excluded from the loan market purely&#13;
because of the 'wrong' subjective judgment of the banks. Further, as no loan&#13;
is made, no new information is generated about the productivity of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
borrowers which might change perceptions. The situation may persist until an&#13;
enterprising bank takes a chance or government policy intervenes. This may&#13;
help to explain why organized, largely urban banks in developing countries do&#13;
not lend to unorganized informal small firms, and agricultural borrowers.      It&#13;
may also explain low levels of long term lending, and of lending to new&#13;
entreprenuers, new industries and those desiring to use sophisticated&#13;
technology. Even if lending takes place, as in the case of non-traditional&#13;
exports, the loans may be less than necessary and carry a high interest&#13;
rate. Similar things happen when the economy is opened to international&#13;
capital flows. Multinationals or large organized firms can obtain funds at&#13;
international rates, but other firms are completely excluded from this&#13;
market. In all these cases the problem is an assymetry in the amount of&#13;
information available and the inability of the banks to evaluate relatively&#13;
unfamiliar activities and methods of operations. Government policies can be&#13;
used to correct this problem, however.&#13;
It can be shown that a ceiling on interest rates compounds the&#13;
problem instead of correcting it, or creates one if none existed before.&#13;
Collateral requirements rise and the expected profits of the firm are reduced&#13;
even further.   The loan size falls further thus increasing inefficiency.     If&#13;
the firm's expected profits fall sufficiently, it may not find it profitable&#13;
to take any loan. The imposition of minimum lending requirements for a class&#13;
of firms also raises collateral requirements, reduces the firm's expected&#13;
profits and may eliminate it from the market. If this does not happen however&#13;
efficiency will be restored. The best way to correct the inefficiency arising&#13;
from differential expectations is to introduce either an interest subsidy or a&#13;
lump sum subsidy per loan. Either of these policies increases efficiency and&#13;
moves the size of loans, interest rates and firms' expected profits in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
right direction. In the case of 'monopoly', none of these four policy options&#13;
can affect firm profits. In addition the fixed sum subsidy (per loan) has no&#13;
effect on the equilibrium. The minimum lending requirement policy may&#13;
therefore be preferred to the interest subsidy policy as it involves no&#13;
subsidy to the monopolist. Alternatively, an interest subsidy may be&#13;
accompanied by a lump sum tax on the monopolist, but this may not be a&#13;
realistic option. The analysis of competitive equilibrium shows that credit&#13;
ceilings can be justified in one case: one in which the credit market is&#13;
functioning efficiently for only one group of firms, while all other firms are&#13;
suffering from the inefficiency analyzed above. A credit ceiling on this&#13;
group of firms would reduce their expected marginal product of loans, and&#13;
bring them closer to the levels for all other firms. Table 5 summarizes the&#13;
implications of these and other policies.&#13;
The previous analysis assumes that all firms have sufficient&#13;
collateral to satisfy the equilibrium requirements. This may not be true for&#13;
poor household firms and farmers. When collateral is not sufficient, the loan&#13;
interest rate rises, but not enough to compensate fully. Loan amounts&#13;
therefore fall, increasing market inefficiency. Under certain conditions no&#13;
equilibrium may exist, so that such firms are excluded from the loan market.&#13;
The best policy in this situation is to offer a collateral subsidy for all&#13;
loans to this category of borrowers. This can be a fixed amount of collateral&#13;
or a proportion of total collateral to be paid by the government in case of&#13;
default by the firm. Private insurance programs can not address this problem&#13;
as these would increase bank's transaction cost (T). This in turn moves the&#13;
loan amount, interest rate and collateral value in exactly the opposite&#13;
direction possibly leaving no net effect.&#13;

The policy analysis must be modified slightly in the presence of&#13;
collateral constraints. Both interest ceilings and minimum lending&#13;
requirements raise the equilibrium collateral level and thus hurt the poorest&#13;
entrepreneurs most. In the latter case when the class of firms is a broad one&#13;
(such as all agricultural producers) the banks have an incentive to&#13;
concentrate all loans on the wealthier households with the largest available&#13;
collateral. This is in fact what is observed in LDCs where such programs were&#13;
implemented. Both the interest subsidy and the subsidy per loan reduce&#13;
collateral requirements and therefore tend to draw in producers previously&#13;
excluded for this lack of collateral.&#13;
The model also explains what happens when LDCs open their economies&#13;
to international capital flows. Public sector corporations, being backed by&#13;
the government, have the most effective collateral and are able to borrow at&#13;
international rates. Other firms, even those with sufficient wealth, do not&#13;
usually have collateral in a form fungible enough to satisfy foreign banks.&#13;
Their effective collateral for foreign borrowing is much less and consequently&#13;
the equilibrium loan rate much higher. If this rate is higher than their&#13;
traditional local rate, access to international capital markets has no effect&#13;
on them. The model also sheds light on government borrowing in international&#13;
capital markets. Developed countries can be viewed as prime customers for&#13;
whom virtually no collateral is needed. Developing countries would require&#13;
different amounts of collateral. Because of the absence of international&#13;
legal enforcement effective collateral is virtually zero. Such constrained&#13;
equilibria would result in lower than optimal loan sizes and higher interest&#13;
rates. Differential expectations between banks and countries exacerbate this&#13;
problem.10/ There are two other noteworthy differences from the identical&#13;
expectations case. The effect of changes in firms equity on competitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
equilibrium is ambiguous. This explains why many empirical studies of the&#13;
relationship between equity levels and interest rates have proved totally&#13;
inconclusive. If the introduction of HYV technology in agriculture is seen&#13;
primarily as increasing working capital requirements and the productivity of&#13;
working capital, then the effect on loan volume becomes ambiguous. Given&#13;
differential expectations, the introduction of HYV may produce greater&#13;
(smaller) credit market inefficiency, thus increasing (reducing) the need for&#13;
government intervention.&#13;
In chapter V, we drop the assumption that all banks have the same&#13;
expectations. We continue to focus on the case in which the firm is more&#13;
optimistic than the banks, as it seems the most realistic one. The resulting&#13;
model was explained towards the end of section 1.3. It was indicated there&#13;
that if we put the banks in order, with the most optimistic first and the&#13;
least optimistic last, bank one will make a loan at terms which give as much&#13;
profit to a firm as it could get with the best terms that bank two could&#13;
offer. Among the results which follow are that loan terms are defined by&#13;
competition between the two most optimistic banks, and are independent of what&#13;
the rest of the banks (3 to n) have to offer. The more pessimistic the view&#13;
of bank two, the higher the expected profit and the implicit monopoly element&#13;
in the profits of the bank (bank one) making the loans. If there is only one&#13;
bank, the solution reduces to the 'monopoly' equilibrium of the differential&#13;
expectations case. If banks one and two have exactly the same expectations&#13;
and do not collude with each other, the solution reduces to the competitive&#13;
equilibrium of the differential expectation case. The only type of collusion&#13;
which would change the last result is one in which banks agreed to divide the&#13;
market by assigning different sets of potential borrowers to different banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Consider the case of rural credit markets and rural moneylenders who&#13;
are often suspected of extracting monopoly profits. The analysis in chapter V&#13;
suggests that the situation is one of competitive monopoly. The moneylender&#13;
-landlord, farmer, retailer, output buyer or pure moneylender - with the&#13;
closest information links and similarity of expectation to the borrower makes&#13;
the loan, but earns an implicit monopoly profit. The size of this profit&#13;
depends chiefly on the money lender with the most closely closely expectations&#13;
and information links.   One would expect that a moneylender based in a village&#13;
has better information about its inhabitants than does a lender in a different&#13;
village.  As was noted at the end of section 1.3, however, the flow of&#13;
information is not the sole criterion for information links. Knowledge of the&#13;
productive activity concerned can be equally important, as information about&#13;
the activity has to be interpreted correctly if it is to be meaningful. Thus,&#13;
we find cases in which farm households borrow from a village moneylender, but&#13;
all the weavers in the village borrow from a moneylender in a distant village&#13;
whose entire clientele consists of weavers from many different villages5/&#13;
In effect, the monopoly element of profit can arise merely from the special&#13;
information and knowledge possesed by the banker who actually makes the loans.&#13;
When an urban based bank opens a rural, branch or is forced to do so&#13;
by the government, it can easily happen that, given its limited information&#13;
links, there is no effect on the rural credit market. This is what we would&#13;
expect if the new branch was in the position of banks 3 to n for all&#13;
categories of borrowers. For some categories of borrowers, however, such as&#13;
large farmers, it may replace a local money lender as the closest&#13;
competitor. In this case, we would observe an improvement of the credit terms&#13;
for this category of borrowers only, but the loans would continue to be made&#13;
by the traditional source. Only in the case in which the urban banks'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
expectations were closest to those of the potential borrowers would we expect&#13;
the latter to start taking loans from the new bank. The last situation seems&#13;
highly unlikely because we have not so far considered inter-bank differences&#13;
in transaction costs and the opportunity cost of funds. These are likely to&#13;
be significantly lower for large urban banks. Because of these two factors&#13;
some borrowers, usually the largest, most organized and modern farmers, would&#13;
get more loans at better terms. Some of the medium sized farmers might&#13;
benefit from the increased competition from the urban bank, through the&#13;
consequent reduction in the (implicit) monopoly rent obtained by traditional&#13;
lenders. The large mass of peasants may not be affected at all, however. One&#13;
of the policy implications of this analysis is the desirability of encouraging&#13;
non-traditional lenders like newly rich medium farmers to become bankers in&#13;
rural areas. An alternative is to subsidize and encourage the urban banks to&#13;
acquire personnel with local backgrounds and specialized agricultural&#13;
knowledge as lending agents before entering rural credit markets.5!'    In fact&#13;
if banks work closely with agricultural extension agents in diffusing new&#13;
technology and practices, they may have a significant advantage in lending to&#13;
farmers introducing HYV technology. Given the limited scientific knowledge of&#13;
traditional money lenders, modern organized banks could easily establish the&#13;
closest links with farmers who have recently decided to use new agricultural&#13;
technology.&#13;
The model also provides insight into the role and nature of informal&#13;
urban credit markets. Given the similarities in organizational structure and&#13;
methods of operation of informal small-scale enterprises and informal bankers,&#13;
information links and expectations may be closer than between the later and&#13;
modern organized banks. We expect a similar congruence between organized&#13;
banks and large organized firms. The model would then suggest that informal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
banks will lend largely to small informal firms and organized banks to large&#13;
organized ones.53V   A testable implication of the model is that observed&#13;
transaction costs and/or default rates for organized bank-small firms loans&#13;
(which actually take place), need not be different from those 6f informal&#13;
bank-small firm loans. An interesting variation on the above noted&#13;
segregation of borrower types comes from Korea. An important section of the&#13;
Korean informal kerb market lends to the same large corporations, who happen&#13;
to be rationed by the government on the organized markets.54/ This&#13;
paradoxical situation proves to be quite consistent with the present model.&#13;
The informal lenders use the personnel and managers of the organized banking&#13;
sector to evaluate potential borrowers. The information links of these&#13;
personnel are clearly with large organized firms. One policy implication of&#13;
the analysis is that informal banks should in general be encouraged rather&#13;
than restricted. There is, however, an important proviso. Given the nature&#13;
of these markets the scope of information links can be highly restricted.&#13;
Thus, for example informal banks may be caste or kin based 55/ or specialized&#13;
in certain markets such as those for grain and agricultural raw materials. A&#13;
general encouragement to informal banks may have little effect on credit to&#13;
small entrepreneurs or specific industries; well focused incentives, designed&#13;
to encourage, e.g., small entrepreneurs with specialized knowledge to become&#13;
bankers would prove much more fruitful. The model also provides a rationale&#13;
for the creation of specialized banks such as industrial development banks and&#13;
export-import banks, as the accumulation of specialized knowledge and the&#13;
creation of information links can improve the efficiency of lending.&#13;
An analysis similar to that done for the introduction of an urban&#13;
based bank into a rural area can be done for the entry of international banks&#13;
into an indigenous LDC credit market when restrictions on capital movements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
are lifted. We would expect loans to be made primarily to multinational firms&#13;
and large government enterprises. Increased competition may have some effect&#13;
on loan terms for large organized indigenous firms, but is unlikely to have&#13;
much of a direct effect on the terms at which loans are made to the large&#13;
majority of medium and smaller firms.&#13;
Finally, the model presented in this chapter provides micro-&#13;
foundations for Schumpeter's theory of the important role of financial&#13;
intermediation in growth and development in the context of technical&#13;
innovation and the innovating entrepreneur. It provides similar justification&#13;
for the Gershenkron (1960) hypothesis.16/&#13;
So far, the question of the firms' intentions have been ignored. In&#13;
chapters VI and VII we consider situations in which the potential borrower&#13;
willfully tries to mislead the lender in some way. To make these complex&#13;
issues easier and to delineate their effects more clearly, we return to the&#13;
simplifying assumptions of the identical expectations case. First we consider&#13;
the problem of the dishonest borrower who tries to pass himself off as an&#13;
honest one. Then we examine the case of a firm which knowingly acts as if it&#13;
is more productive than it is, in order to obtain better terms from the&#13;
bank.57/ The analysis shows that these firms can benefit at the expense of&#13;
honest or more productive firms. More importantly, the higher the proportion&#13;
of dishonest or less productive firms, the greater the degree of market&#13;
inefficiency as loan amounts fall. Thus these situations of 'moral hazard' or&#13;
adverse selection' as they are called in the insurance literature can&#13;
independently cause inefficiency in the market.5!' This inefficiency is very&#13;
similar to that caused by differential expectations, and the policy analysis&#13;
of that case is essentially applicable here also. There is one major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
difference, however. The dishonest and the less productive borrowers who are&#13;
the direct cause of the problem, will gain from the policy intervention.&#13;
It is shown in these cases, that there is a minimum proportion of&#13;
honest/productive borrowers, say pmin, below which the terms become so bad for&#13;
them, that they drop out of the market and no loans are made. The same result&#13;
follows if banks judge that the proportion of honest/productive borrowers is&#13;
less than Pmin, even if the actual value of p is greater than Pmin.    This is&#13;
an extreme form of inefficiency.&#13;
One or both of these problems of moral hazard (honest/dishonest&#13;
borrowers) and adverse selection (less/more productive borrowers) explain&#13;
several phenomena which are observed in credit markets. Among these are the&#13;
following:5!9/ The interlinking of credit and other markets; the tendency for&#13;
arrears of credit co-operatives to rise and become ruinous in areas where&#13;
farmers have great political influence; the exclusion of various categories of&#13;
business borrowers in developing countries in transition (this is likely to be&#13;
greater than in either closed static peasant economies, or in advanced&#13;
economies with well developed communication systems); the lack of loans to new&#13;
entrepreneurs or firms with little history; the reluctance of banks to make&#13;
long term loans; delayed and gradual growth in loans to recently established&#13;
types of productive activity (new products, product categories), non-&#13;
traditional exports and firms introducing unfamiliar types of technology. For&#13;
example, consider the problem of short term loans versus long term loans. As&#13;
the former can be endlessly repeated, the bank obtains new information and has&#13;
the opportunity to evalute performance at the end of each (short) loan term so&#13;
that the banks judgments can therefore become more certain. Over the course&#13;
of a long term loan the state of the economy, the industry and the firm can&#13;

solely on the basis of initial information. It is therefore much more&#13;
difficult to identify which of several productivity classes each firm falls&#13;
into, and whether it will remain there. Further, even though the firm appears&#13;
to be honest at the time the loan is made, the longer time during which the&#13;
bank has little feedback and control increases the risk that major changes&#13;
will occur which will make the firm dishonest.&#13;
The analysis shows how these problems can be dealt with by the&#13;
banking version of research and development. This would involve developing&#13;
indicators which separate a class of firms into two groups one of which has a&#13;
higher proportion of honest/more productive firms. Excluded borrowers (or&#13;
types of loans) may be brought into the loan market by raising p' above&#13;
Pmin- It is also shown, through a simple example, that the private return to&#13;
such R&amp;D may be significantly lower than the social return because of the&#13;
problem of appropriation. A case is therefore made for government subsidies&#13;
to this activity. However because of the peculiar nature of this R&amp;D, the&#13;
special problems of monitoring it, and the likelihood that it involves a&#13;
process of learning by doing, -6 it may be necessary to couple subsidies with&#13;
minimum lending requirements for the given class.&#13;

II. THE BASIC MODEL&#13;
2.1 Repayment under Uncertainty: An Overview&#13;
We assume for this and the next three chapters that the borrower is&#13;
honest, and has no deliberate intention to distort facts and/or cheat the&#13;
lender. Earlier models implicitly assumed that loans or credit are for&#13;
investment in a completely new project, and that the technology to be used was&#13;
of the fixed co-efficient type. A large proportion of credit, however, is&#13;
short term commercial credit. Further, in addition to the usual&#13;
substitutability between labor and capital, recent studies demonstrate that&#13;
working capital is an important independent factor of production. 11 The&#13;
present model therefore assumes that the loan could be for a new project or an&#13;
existing business, and for manufacturing, services, trade or agriculture.&#13;
The lender must form some estimate of the likely repayment by a&#13;
borrower for any given loan terms and different loan amounts at these terms.&#13;
The pattern of repayment or the expected repayment can be seen as made up of&#13;
two parts. One is the likely pattern of returns to the productive activity&#13;
for which the loan is taken by the borrower. In general this return must&#13;
depend on the size of the loan which, along with the borrower's own funds or&#13;
equity contribution, constitutes the total capital of the. firm. Further, at&#13;
the time the loan is made, this return is in general uncertain, and this is&#13;
what leads to the uncertainty in repayment. We would expect that as the loan&#13;
size increases the expected or mean value of the return would increase, but by&#13;
decreasing amounts. The second part is a repayment schedule relating any&#13;
given level of realized return to the amount repaid. This depends on both the&#13;
terms of the loan (interest rate, collateral) and the amount loaned. The bank&#13;
can then calculate the expected repayment for any loan contract for the given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
borrower, by putting these two things together. As the opportunity cost of&#13;
making the loan is known with certainty the expected profits of the bank are&#13;
obtained by subtracting these costs from the expected repayment.&#13;
The calculation for the firm is the mirror image of this process,&#13;
with the expected repayment calculated in the same manner. This would be&#13;
identical to the calculation of the lender if both had the same judgment about&#13;
the pattern or probability distribution of returns. In general, however,&#13;
these tend to differ and so too does the calculated value of expected&#13;
repayments. The expected profits of the borrower are then obtained by&#13;
subtracting these from the expected returns from the productive activity.&#13;
2.2 Dependence of Uncertain Returns on Loan Taken&#13;
More formally we assume that to produce and sell the given good or&#13;
service, the firm or entrepreneur desiring the loan requires a minimum capital&#13;
stock (k &gt; 0). The net return, gross of costs to be incurred in the loan&#13;
transaction, is y for the time period under consideration. This period is&#13;
taken to be equal to the term of the loan. The uncertain return, y, is&#13;
assumed to have the density and distribution functions f(y) and F(y)&#13;
respectively. It is assumed that the return cannot fall below some value&#13;
-w.2/ The rationale for this is that the firm or entrepreneur cannot lose&#13;
more than his legally identifiable wealth. Further, if the period is not too&#13;
long, as is true for commercial loans, there is a limit to losses that can be&#13;
incurred during it. We also assume that there is a maximum value of the&#13;
return which will not be exceeded, i.e. there is zero chance that the return&#13;
during the period will be above this value.3/ Following usual practice, the&#13;
density function f(y) can be depicted as in the figure below: thus the&#13;
probability that y will have the value of y1 is F(yl).4/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
f(y)  ,&#13;
y1 -y Y1 y+1y&#13;
2         2&#13;
As noted ealier, however, the return y is not independent of the&#13;
amount of capital (k) employed by the borrower. Formally this is represented&#13;
by assuming that the density function f(y) depends on k, that is f(y) =&#13;
f(y,k). This can be depicted in the following diagram (k &lt; k( &lt; k2);&#13;
f(y}  l ,&#13;
g(-k-k) f(y,k1   f(y, k2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
In general both the mean value of the distribution and its spread would&#13;
change. In the present paper we make the simplifying assumption that the&#13;
shape of the distribution is identical for all k and only the mean changes.&#13;
That is, there is a given density f(y) for k = k. Any increase in k over k&#13;
increases the mean or expectation of y, by translating the density function to&#13;
the right (see the figure) by an amount g(k-k). Corresponding to the usual&#13;
marginal productivity conditions in traditional production theory, we put some&#13;
limitations on this function which can be taken as assuming declining marginal&#13;
product of the loan.5/ The shift function, representing production and sales&#13;
constraints, is assumed to be known with certainty. The total capital (k) is&#13;
the sum of the firm's or entrepreneur's equity contribution (E) and the loan&#13;
L, i.e. k=E+L. Formally, we will assume that E is determined outside the&#13;
model. Hereafter we will refer to the borrower as the firm, and the lender as&#13;
the bank. Both the bank and the firm have a subjective evaluation of the&#13;
firm's prospects during the term of the loan, represented by the density&#13;
function f(y) [or the distribution of returns F(y)]. Where necessary we will&#13;
distinguish the two by putting a prime on the firm's distribution [F'(y) or&#13;
f'(y)].&#13;
2.3 Dependence of Repayment on Returns&#13;
In addition to the loan interest rate r, collateral C is part of the&#13;
terms of the locn contract. We assume for simplicity that this is a value&#13;
the bank can recover from the firm with certainty. 6/ The maximum amount of&#13;
collateral that the firm can offer depends on the nature of the project,-/ its&#13;
equity contribution and its legally identifiable outside wealth.!/ The&#13;
maximum acceptable collateral Cma to the bank will also depend on the bank's&#13;
judgment about its value and recoverability. We will, however, take Cma as&#13;
given, with C constrained as Cm&gt; C &gt;0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
Most earlier models make repayment dependent on end of period&#13;
wealth. 9/ If this exceeds the due amount, full repayment is made; if not,&#13;
the whole wealth is transferred. This type of repayment schedule-occurs only&#13;
in the case of bankruptcy, and may also be a reasonable approximation for very&#13;
long term loans. In practice banks are extremely reluctant to demand full&#13;
repayment when compliance would entail closing down the firm and declaring&#13;
bankruptcy. This is quite rational when expectation of returns exceeds loan&#13;
repayment obligations. Firms are of course equally anxious to ensure that the&#13;
firm's future returns are not adversely affected by a single adverse realiza-&#13;
tion of what is known by both to be a random variable.  In effect repayment at&#13;
the end of the period is a function of returns during the period with an&#13;
expectation that remaining sums due will be cleared as soon as possible.&#13;
Within the limitations of the single period model, however, we can only&#13;
approximate this situation.      For any loan contract (L,r,C) repayment as a&#13;
function of returns y is assumed to have the following form (shown in figure-&#13;
1):&#13;
Min [(l+r)L, Max(L+y-A,C)]&#13;

Where the symbols have the following meaning:&#13;
y   =     Return on the productive activity in which the loan is to be used.&#13;
r   =    Rate of interest on loans by bank to firm.&#13;
i   =    Rate of interest on bank deposits, or the opportunity cost of funds&#13;
to the bank.&#13;
L   =    Value of loan&#13;
C   =    Value of collateral&#13;
t   =    Variable component of transaction/administration cost to the bank&#13;
T   =    Fixed component of transaction/administration cost to bank.     Includes&#13;
administrative costs and returns to capital.&#13;
A   =    Transaction cost to the firm, or administrative cost of taking and&#13;
repaying loan.&#13;
at =     -(L-C)+A = C-L+A&#13;
b'  =    rL+A&#13;
a   =    a'-g,   b=b'-g&#13;
Given the definition of collateral, repayment of C is assured to the&#13;
bank. If the net income y-A is greater than the interest due, rL, full repay-&#13;
ment is made. When net income is less than interest due, repayment is reduced&#13;
by an equivalent amount so as to leave the net return to equity at zero&#13;
(figure 2).&#13;
2.4 Definition of Competitive Equilibrium&#13;
Before proceeding further it is useful to define the equilibrium&#13;
concept used in this paper. There are assumed to be several categories or&#13;
classes of borrowers. All borrowers within a class/category are assumed to be&#13;
identical with respect to all characteristics relevant to the loan&#13;
transaction. In the competitive case we assume that there are a large number&#13;
of identical banks, initially assumed to possess identical information about&#13;
the borrowing firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
To determine the terms of the equilibrium loan contract between a&#13;
bank and any firm in a given category, we envision a traditional Marshallian&#13;
(or Walrasian) procedure as follows: Each bank obtains all its inputs (and in&#13;
particular its funds) on perfectly competitive markets. In other words each&#13;
bank can obtain as much in deposits as it wants at the competitive deposit&#13;
interest rate i. On the loan side, all banks act as perfect competitors,&#13;
taking the loan interest rate (r) and collateral (C) terms as given and&#13;
determining the loan they are willing to make to any firm from that category&#13;
by maximizing expected profits with respect to loan amount. Thus for each (r,&#13;
C) pair there is a unique loan amount which any (one of the identical) bank&#13;
(s) will be willing to make to any (one of the identical) firm (s) in the&#13;
given category. As noted in the introduction, each loan transaction is&#13;
ultimately a bilateral one between one bank and one firm.&#13;
The firms in the given category similarly act as 'perfect&#13;
competitors' by taking the loan interest rate and collateral as given and&#13;
determine their loan demand by maximizing expected profits with respect to&#13;
loan amount. Thus for each (r, C) pair there is a unique loan amount that a&#13;
firm desires.&#13;
As in the traditional model competition between the banks is assumed&#13;
to reduce the expected profits of the bank from any loan to zero. This&#13;
condition along with the traditional condition that loan supply equal loan&#13;
demand at the equilibrium terms (r , c ) determines the competitive loan&#13;
contract (L , r*, c*) between a bank and a firm from the given category. It&#13;
is of course irrelevant which particular bank from the set of identical banks&#13;
makes the loan to which particular firm from the set of identical firms in the&#13;
given category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
This is where the present model differs from the traditional model&#13;
of the goods market. In that model the 'supply equals demand' conditions&#13;
determines a unique price quantity pair, while the zero profit condition&#13;
determines the number of sellers. Here the demand-supply condition defines a&#13;
set of feasible (r, C) combinations, with the unique competitive equilibrium&#13;
determined by the zero expected profit condition. On the other hand, as long&#13;
as the number of banks remains sufficiently large so that they act as perfet&#13;
competitors, the entry and exit of banks has no effect on the loan amount that&#13;
any existing bank is willing to provide to a particular firm on any given&#13;
terms (r, C).&#13;
The concept of equilibrium as outlined here appears (superficially)&#13;
to be different from the contractual equilibrium commonly used in models of&#13;
share tenancy. In the latter case the bank would maximize its expected&#13;
profits with respect to all variables of the loan contract, subject to&#13;
optimizing behavior (as depicted here) on the part of the firm.     It can easily&#13;
be shown that the competitive equilibrium (zero expected profit for banks)&#13;
obtained in the two ways is identical.&#13;
2.5 Derivation of Demand and Supply Curves for Loans&#13;
Throughout this paper we assume risk neutrality on the part of both&#13;
bank and firm. This is in line with traditional theory if the former is also&#13;
considered to be a type of firm. One could also appeal to the law of large&#13;
numbers if the bank has many borrowers with uncorrelated returns. More real-&#13;
istically the present paper can form the point of departure for a more general&#13;
analysis using the mean-variance approach.&#13;
The expected profits (PB) of the bank can be obtained from figure 3&#13;
and the probability distribution of y, and on simplification (see appendix 1)&#13;
is 12/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
PB ' X - (l+i+t)L-T where&#13;
X - (l+r)L fdF(y) + fb(L'A+y+g)dF(y) + C                (1)&#13;
is the expectation of repayment, and all other variable have been defined&#13;
earlier.   For any (r,C) the bank obtains the optimal loan size by maximizing&#13;
expected profits to obtain (see appendix 1).13/&#13;
XL = l+i+t                                              (2)&#13;
where XL is the differential of X with respect to L. XL therefore represents&#13;
the expected marginal increase in total (principal plus interest) repayment as&#13;
the size of the loan made by the bank increases. On simplifying, this reduces to&#13;
rf mOdF(y,k) + gb =ldF(y,k) = JadF(y,k) + i + t            (2')&#13;
b  ~      ga'             -w&#13;
where we have re-substituted F(y,k) for F(y) along with the changes this&#13;
entails. The optimality condition (2) can be understood with reference to&#13;
figure 1. In the full repayment region, y &lt; b', a marginal change in loan&#13;
increases the bank's profit by the amount r, so that the first term is the&#13;
marginal increase in expectation of returns for this portion. Now g is the&#13;
marginal productivity of capital or loan or the marginal change in the expec-&#13;
tation of total returns. In the partial repayment region, a' &lt; y &lt; b', the&#13;
whole of this is passed on to the bank, as is clear from figure 2.     Therefore&#13;
the second term is the marginal change in expectation of returns for this&#13;
region. In the default region, y &lt; a', there is no increase in repayment. On&#13;
the contrary any increased L is not repaid and therefore appears as a marginal&#13;
cost in the first term on the right. (i+t) is of course the marginal cost to&#13;
the bank for obtaining and loaning more funds, and is incurred with&#13;
certainty. Equation (2') therefore equates the marginal change in expectation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
of returns to the marginal change in expectation of cost. This is also&#13;
summarized in equation (2).&#13;
We can implicitly solve equation (2) for loan size in terms of the&#13;
loan interest rate and collateral as LB     LB (r,C).  For given C, this curve&#13;
has the characteristics of a loan supply curve. This identification must be&#13;
made with caution however, because it is a given bank's optimal supply&#13;
response to a single borrower having the characteristics assumed, when both&#13;
bank and firm are acting in a competitive market framework. By implicitly&#13;
differentiating this function, it is shown in appendix 1 that it must have&#13;
either of the two forms shown below     /&#13;
LB i&#13;
/~~~~ Ir&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
The firm's expectation of profits, (PFO' from figure 2 and the&#13;
firm's judgment of the probability of returns, on simplification (see appendix&#13;
1) are&#13;
PF =L+y+g-A-X',                                               (3)&#13;
15/&#13;
where  y is the mean or expected value of the return y,-       and&#13;
X'=(l+r)L fb dF'(y) + fb (L-A+y+g)dF'(y) + Cl 'F'(y)&#13;
b            a                       -&#13;
is the firm's expectation of repayment. As noted earlier we use a prime on&#13;
F(y) to indicate the firm's subjective distribution. For any (r,C) the firm&#13;
maximizes (3) with respect to loan size L to obtain,&#13;
XL'=g'(k-k)                                                   (4)&#13;
where XL' is the differential of X' with respect to L.       XL therefore&#13;
represents the expected marginal increase in total (principal plus interest)&#13;
repayment as the size of the loan taken by the firm increases. Equation (4)&#13;
can be simplified to yield&#13;
rfmdF(y,k) = fadF(y,k) + gI(fadF(y,k) + f dF(y,k) )         (4')&#13;
b                                         b&#13;
As in the case of the bank, the firm equates the marginal change in&#13;
expectation of its costs to the marginal change in expectation of returns.&#13;
The first two terms are similar to those for the bank but appear on the&#13;
opposite side of the ledger. The last term is the marginal change in&#13;
productivity which is expected to accrue to the firm. Again equation (4)&#13;
summarizes the marginal condition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
If we implicitly solve (4) we obtain loan 'demand' as a function of&#13;
r and C; LF=LF(r,C). For a given C this can be interpreted as the given&#13;
firm's loan demand function, again with the caution that the firm will deal&#13;
with only one bank. The shape of this demand function is the inverse of that&#13;
for the supply function. That is it is either negatively sloped, or initially&#13;
negative and then positively sloped. If we depict the demand and supply&#13;
curves together we have two possibilities as in figure 4(a) and 4(b):&#13;
Figure 4 (a) Loan 'demand' and         Figure 4 (b)&#13;
supply curves for&#13;
given C.&#13;
LB                                     LB&#13;
&amp;       LF Demand     LB Supply        &amp;&#13;

L8 I~ ~ ~~~~~~L&#13;
r                                       r'  r&#13;
In figure 4(b) it is obvious that equilibrium at r' is unstable and&#13;
must reduce to that at r*. Unless otherwise stated, we will therefore refer&#13;
only to the case in figure 4(a) in subsequent discussions. Note that when&#13;
E &lt; k neither curve will extend below Lmin=k-E as this is the minimum loan&#13;
necessary for the productive activity to take place and produce any return at&#13;
all.&#13;
2.6 Definition of the Pessimism Factor&#13;
Before going on to the analysis it is useful to define a pessimism&#13;
parameter O. For the formal analysis, the most important way in which the&#13;
bank's and firm's subjective distribution will be taken to differ, will be in&#13;
terms of this factor O. Thus we can re-write the distribution function F(y)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
as F(y,e).   An increase in e  from   91  to  E2  is defined as an increase in&#13;
pessimism if&#13;
F(y,E)1)  F(y,G2) for all y                                 (5)&#13;
with strict inequality for at least one y 161 In the formal analysis unless&#13;
otherwise specified, the only difference between the bank's subjective&#13;
distribution F(y) and the firm's subjective distribution F'(y) will be assumed&#13;
due to differences in the risk parameter    9.  This amounts essentially to a&#13;
difference in perception of the mean or expected value of the return y 17/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. Identical Expectations and Definition of Loan Market Efficiency&#13;
3.1 Efficiency of Competitive and Monopoly Equilibrium&#13;
We start with an analysis of the case in which the subjective distri-&#13;
butions of the banks and firm are identical, i.e. F'(y) = F(y). This will be&#13;
referred to as the identical expectations case. _Y      In this case the expec-&#13;
tation of repayment (X), and all its derivatives, are identical for the firm&#13;
and the banks.   The optimality conditions (2) and (4) reduce to&#13;
g'(L + E - K) - i + t                                         (5)&#13;
XL = 1 + i + t                                                (4)&#13;
This amounts to equating loan demand with loan supply, for a given collateral,&#13;
or finding the intersection of the loan supply and demand loci for any given&#13;
collateral. This assumes, however, that both the parties to the transaction&#13;
made non-negative expected profits. Therefore if the loan is actually made we&#13;
must also have,&#13;
PB &gt; 0 and PF &gt; PF                                            (6)&#13;
where PF is either the expected profits of the firm (for E &gt; K) if no loan is&#13;
taken, or the opportunity cost of equity funds (if E &lt; K). If we implicitly&#13;
differentiate (5) and (4) and use equations (1) and (3), we obtain (appendix&#13;

The solution of (5), (4) and (6) therefore appears to have the&#13;
characteristics of an Edgeworth contract curve in (r,C) space. Graphically&#13;
this can be represented as curve HJ in figure 5(a) and H'J' in 5(b) below&#13;
PB(L*, r, C) = 0 at H'(H) and PF(L*,        ) =PF at J'(J) 2/ where PBincreases&#13;
and PF decreases progressively from H to J (and from.H' to J').&#13;

The curve HJ differs significantly from the Edgeworth contract curve, however,&#13;
ref lecting the difference in the equilibrium. concept needed here, which is&#13;
discussed in sections 1.2 and 2.4. In the latter, the competitive equilibrium&#13;
point can be anywhere on the curve. Here it is natural to define the point H&#13;
as the perfectly competitive equilibrium and J as the monopoly equilibrium,&#13;
HJ bears more resemblance to a contract curve in a two person zero sum game.&#13;
The HJ curve is invariant to the number of identical banks and identical firms&#13;
that are present in the market, however, and applies to each bank-firm pair.&#13;
Figure 5(b) shows how this curve arises in the supply-demand framework: as C&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57 -&#13;
increases from C to C both curves shift to the right, raising r from r to r.&#13;
Given identical expectations, L remains unchanged at L*=g'1l(i+t)-E+K.&#13;
Before discussing the competitive equilibrium further, it is useful to draw&#13;
out the implications of equation (5).&#13;
Equation (5) is a rather remarkable result.    It shows that at loan&#13;
market equilibrium, the expected marginal product of capital will be equated&#13;
to the marginal cost of funds to the banks plus the marginal cost of trans-&#13;
ferring these funds from savers to borrowers. This result is independent of&#13;
the banks' and firms' transaction costs, T and A respectively. - It is also&#13;
independent of the interest rate on loans, the shape of the probability&#13;
distribution of returns and the degree of risk involved. As (5) does not&#13;
contain collateral C, it is also independent of the degree of competition or&#13;
monopoly in the loan market.&#13;
It is fairly easy to show that equation (5) is a necessary condition&#13;
for loan market efficiency. For this purpose it is useful to think of the&#13;
loan market as a black box whose input consists of deposit funds and whose&#13;
output consists of returns to the productive activity. Ignoring transaction&#13;
costs (t, T, A) the two sides of equation i = g'(L + E - K) correspond to the&#13;
marginal inputs into and outputs from the sub-system (given E).     If i &gt; g' the&#13;
net expected product of this sub-system can be increased by reducing the loan&#13;
amount. If i &lt; g' the net expected product of the sub-system can be increased&#13;
by increasing the loan amount. If we define efficiency in terms of expected&#13;
values given the current information set of borrowers and lenders, i must&#13;
equal g' in an efficient system. This argument carries over unchanged if&#13;
transaction costs are identical across all bank-firm pairs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
If we make the usual generalization about embedding this market in a&#13;
competitive economy, economy wide, funds will be allocated to their most&#13;
productive use as long as all banks have equal variable transaction costs t,&#13;
and each loan transaction is made between bank-firm pairs having identical&#13;
expectations. Recall that we have already made the assumption that the bank&#13;
deposit market is competitive. This assumption may not be violated if a bank&#13;
has a monopoly for some sub-category of borrowers firms. If, however, there.&#13;
is only one bank with a global monopoly, the assumption becomes clearly&#13;
unreasonable. Though the above results may still apply for this case, it is&#13;
beyond the scope of the present paper to provide a definitive answer. From&#13;
(7) we also see that for the identical expectations case, we can usefully&#13;
r-r    C-C&#13;
measure the degree of monopoly by either of two indices -      or -    . Further&#13;
r-r    C-C&#13;
the greater the degree of monopoly the greater the transfer of income from&#13;
borrower to lender.    Therefore questions of the distribution of gains between&#13;
borrower and lender and degree of monopoly are directly related.&#13;
Consider the competitive solution with expected bank profit PB equal&#13;
to zero. Traditional models of the credit market have assumed that the&#13;
marginal product of capital would be equated either to the unique interest&#13;
rate prevailing in the market for savings - investment, or to the risk&#13;
adjusted rate if uncertainty is present on the borrowers side. Harberger&#13;
(1980) conjectured however, in the context of international capital markets,&#13;
that if "lenders and borrowers perceived default risk in the same way the risk&#13;
free rate would govern everybody's behavior." This conjecture is shown by the&#13;
above model to have been a very perceptive one, if we substitute the words&#13;
risk in returns' for 'default risk' and assume that transaction costs are&#13;
zero. In this case the expected marginal product of all business loans would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
be equated to the same (deposit) interest rate.    If transaction costs are&#13;
allowed, however, the transaction costs for more risky loans are likely to be&#13;
higher than for safe loans and the universal equality will no longer hold.&#13;
When t and i are identical for all banks, the expectation of&#13;
marginal productivity of capital is equal in all uses. Now suppose the&#13;
variable transaction cost differs across banks for any group of identical&#13;
borrowers, and for different groups of borrowers. Clearly, marginal&#13;
productivity is unlikely to be equal in all uses. In equilibrium each group&#13;
will borrow from the bank with the lowest t for that group. Equation (5) is&#13;
still a necessary condition for loan market efficiency. If T and A also&#13;
differ across bank-firm pairs the equilibrium loan transaction need not be&#13;
between the pair with the lowest t (Chapter V). Nevertheless the total&#13;
expected net return from the loan transaction between any bank-firm pair is&#13;
still highest, when (5) is satisfied. The fixed transaction cost of the bank,&#13;
T, and that of the firm, A, are likely to be positively related as both depend&#13;
on mutual knowledge.!/ These in turn are likely to be positively related to&#13;
the variable component for the bank (t) for the same reason. The last may not&#13;
be true, however, if differences in t are due to the fact that some banks are&#13;
subject to reserve requirements while others are not. 5/&#13;
Equation (5) shows that the loan level is inversely related to the&#13;
variable component of the transaction cost.    Therefore if this is so high for&#13;
some group of firms that g'(E-K)=i+t, the loan market will cease to exist for&#13;
this group.  Recalling that t is the cost factor associated with loan amount&#13;
L, it is unlikely itself to differ for different loan-size classes, i.e.&#13;
between small and large borrowers. It could differ between old and new&#13;
borrowers as the bank takes time to establish the minimum cost procedure for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
given borrower. New borrowers would therefore tend to receive smaller loans&#13;
than similar borrowers who have an established pattern of interaction. This&#13;
is unlikely to be the major factor leading to the disappearance of the loan&#13;
market, however.&#13;
Reserve requirements and the type of instruments in which these&#13;
funds are held are linked directly to t. If government imposed reserve&#13;
requirements are dictated solely by questions of monetary policy and control,&#13;
these may be non-optimal from the perspective of bank operation. This would&#13;
give rise to a difference in t between banks subject to reserve requirements&#13;
and those not so subject. The latter, including informal lenders, would then&#13;
tend to make larger loans to firms with identical characteristics. From the&#13;
social perspective, moreover, there will be a cost in terms of higher marginal&#13;
product and lower output which must be balanced against any gains in terms of&#13;
monetary control.&#13;
3.2 The Competitive Loan Market: Comparative Statics&#13;
We turn next to fuller consideration of the competitive&#13;
equilibrium. We assume that there is a group of one or more identical firms&#13;
and a group of two or more banks with identical transaction costs for this&#13;
group. In the absence of collusion, tacit or explicit, competition between&#13;
the banks will ensure that all loan transactions will take place at zero&#13;
profits for the banks. 6/ Competitive equilibrium is therefore determined by&#13;
equations (5), (4) and (8) below&#13;
PB=X - (l+i+t)L - T = 0                                      (8)&#13;
These equations determine the loan contract (L*,r,C) between any bank and any&#13;
member of the group of firms. In terms of supply-demand diagram of figure&#13;
5(b) this represents the point H'. Implicitly differentiating these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
equations, and solving (appendix 2) we obtain the following:&#13;
br     br   &gt;       Â°'  or  &lt;  Â°'          br  &gt;  Â°; aT   &lt; Â°&#13;
ac     aC   &gt;      bc  &gt;       ac  &gt;        c           PF&#13;
at= &lt;  Â°    &lt;      oÂ° A  &lt;  Â°   T  &gt;  Â°;    A&#13;
br          bC  &gt;        F   _&#13;
be          a0  &lt;   X          be&#13;
As we would expect, a rise in the cost of funds to the bank or in&#13;
its operational costs leads to a rise in the interest rate charged on loans.&#13;
The negative relationship between equity contribution and the interest rate on&#13;
loans is also not surprising if we see the former as affecting the 'quality'&#13;
of the loan, and consequently the price charged for it. 7/ The fact that all&#13;
these factors, except the bank's fixed transaction cost, have an ambiguous&#13;
effect on the collateral C is more interesting. Previous authors have&#13;
generally thought of collateral as a 'quality of loan' variable like equity.&#13;
8/ Alternatively it has been seen, along with interest as a multi-dimensional&#13;
price. 9/&#13;
These results can be interpreted in terms of the supply-demand loci&#13;
LB and LF given in figure 4(a), by using the differentials obtained in&#13;
appendix 1. -LO/ A rise in the bank's deposit interest costs i, or the&#13;
variable transaction cost t, shifts the 'supply' locus down for every r,&#13;
raising the loan rate and lowering loan size. It also directly lowers bank&#13;
expected profits PB below zero. The rise in the loan rate compensates for&#13;
this fall. If it undercompensates, collateral must rise to lift PB above&#13;
zero, also raising r further in the process. If it over-compensates,&#13;
collateral must fall to bring PB down to zero. This reverses the original&#13;
rise in r but obviously not enough to negate it.&#13;
A rise in firm transaction cost A, shifts the supply locus down and&#13;
the demand locus, up at each r, by equal amounts. This raises the interest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
rate while leaving the loan size unchanged. The former raises expected bank&#13;
profits above zero. This is corrected by a fall in collatetal which shifts&#13;
the curves in the reverse direction, by equal amounts. This tends to reduce&#13;
but not negate the initial increase in r.&#13;
A change in bank's fixed transaction cost lowers expected profits&#13;
but has no effect on either curve. This is compensated for by a rise in&#13;
collateral. This shifts the supply curve down and the demand curve up for&#13;
each r, by equal amounts, thus raising the loan interest rate but leaving loan&#13;
size unchanged. If this component of bank transaction cost (T) for any&#13;
category of borrowers is too high, loan terms can become so adverse that the&#13;
firm would expect less profits if it took the loan than it would otherwise.&#13;
In this case the loan market would cease to exist. A similar result follows&#13;
if A is too high. 1/ In terms of the 'contract curve' of figure 5(b), HJ and&#13;
H'J' shrink to a single point and then dissapear when C becomes greater than&#13;
3.3 Analysis of Effects of Changes in the Pessimism Factor&#13;
An increase in e, perhaps representing an increase in pessimism&#13;
relative to a 'true i',    shifts both demand and supply curves to the right by&#13;
equal amounts. This leaves the loan amount unchanged, but raises the interest&#13;
rate, which in turn has a positive effect on expected bank profits PB*     An&#13;
increase in e also directly reduces the bank's expectations of repayment and&#13;
its expected profits. If this direct effect is less than the indirect effect&#13;
in absolute value, PB becomes positive, while in the opposite case it becomes&#13;
negative. Restoration of zero profit equilibrium then requires a fall in&#13;
collateral in the former and a rise in the latter case. A fall (rise) in C&#13;
shifts both curves to the left (right) by equal amounts, leaving loan size&#13;
unchanged, but reducing (enhancing) the initial rise in the loan interest rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
(see figure below). A rise in loan interest rate with a fall in expected&#13;
returns to productive activity is what we might expect, but the fact that&#13;
collateral requirements may fall in this case is an interesting and somewhat&#13;
unexpected result.&#13;

It is easily shown that expected firm profits will fall with an&#13;
increase in the pessimism factor O. This can be interpreted in terms of the&#13;
definition of 0 which implies that the expected or mean returns of the firm&#13;
fall.  It follows that there will be a    01, say 0 in   below which it is not&#13;
profitable for the firm to take a loan as the interest payable has become too&#13;
high. Recall that 0 here represents the identical expectations or subjective&#13;
judgment of the banks and the firm. In principle this G could be different&#13;
from the true i, say 0 T. Consider a situation in which the subjective&#13;
pessimism factor   0 is greater than   0 i   while the true iT (a hypothetical&#13;
construct)   is less than imi   (O &gt; 0    &gt;n &gt;T).  In this case the loan-&#13;
min4.-m-in&#13;
/~ ~ ~ ~~~~~2&#13;
transaction would take place when it should not havep        Such a situation may&#13;
arise during a stock market or credit boom.     We can similarly have the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
opposite case in which the loan market does not exist when it should&#13;
(0 &lt; 0mi &lt; 0T). This pessimistic situation may characterize a traditional&#13;
peasant and a traditional moneylender when they are contemplating a loan for&#13;
an unknown and unfamiliar HYV technology in agriculture. In both cases we&#13;
have a form of inefficiency as a result of wrong mutual expectations.&#13;
Nevertheless, as long as the market exists only when it should&#13;
(either    , 0T &gt;0min or 0 ,m1 T   min ). identical expectations will ensure&#13;
efficiency in the market, no matter how large or how small the difference&#13;
between these identical expectations (0) and the true value ( T) (See footnote&#13;
31 of the introduction for an analogy).&#13;
The question of equity between bank and firm is, however, intimately&#13;
related to the relative position of    0 and  0 .   If banks and firms are over&#13;
T&#13;
optimistic on average the firms will tend to benefit at the cost of the banks,&#13;
as loan interest rates will be lower than they should be. Similarly if both&#13;
are too pessimistic, higher loan interest rates will on average produce a&#13;
relative gain for banks at the cost of firms. This provides an explanation of&#13;
the much noted "natural pessimism of bankers"; it would be more profitable for&#13;
banks in the long run if they could induce firms to adopt a similarly cautious&#13;
approach in judging business returns. This has implication for the analysis&#13;
in the next chapter where bank and firm expectations differ. We would expect&#13;
the banks' judgment of 0 to be biased on the positive side relative to the&#13;
firms(or judgments of mean returns to be biased negatively).&#13;
3.4 Implications for Equity Decisions and Debt-Equity Ratio&#13;
It can also be shown that    P F/ E = g' &gt; 0.  This has interesting&#13;
implications if we step outside the formal loan model to consider equity&#13;
decisions. If no loans were taken, the firm would determine its equity E by&#13;
equating g'(E-K) to h'(E) the marginal cost of E.         If a loan is taken,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
there are two possibilities: if the firm treats the two decisions as&#13;
independent, for a given loan contract (L,r,C) it will maximize expectation of&#13;
profit to obtain equation g'(E+L-K) - XE = h'(E) . This 'perfectly&#13;
competitive' solution means under-use of equity funds and a higher debt-equity&#13;
ratio. If it recognized the link between higher E and better loan terms,&#13;
however, then using 6PF/bE = g' it will choose E so that g'(E+L-K) = h'(E).&#13;
The debt equity ratio will be lower in this interlinked case. In this case&#13;
Pareto optimality is ensured even if the equity market is imperfect, 14/ as&#13;
h'(E) = i+t the opportunity cost of funds to the banks.&#13;
3.5 Prime Borrowers and Prime Rate Convention&#13;
In the above analysis we have assumed that an interior solution&#13;
exists. That is, the equilibrium value of collateral (C) satisfied 0 &lt; C &lt;&#13;
Cma, where Cma is the maximum acceptable collateral mentioned in chapter II.&#13;
It is fruitful to postpone consideration of the case in which C &gt; Cma to the&#13;
next section. Here we consider what happens if C &lt; 0. This situation arises&#13;
when the bank's expected profits PB are positive at the supply-demand&#13;
equilibrium (L'r') for C = 0 i.e. PB(L',r',O) &gt; 0, as shown in figure 6&#13;
(derived in appendix 1) 15/&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
In appendix equation (2") it is shown that PB from (1) can be re-&#13;
written as&#13;
B = (r-i-t)L -      T -  | F(y)dy where a &lt; b.&#13;
Therefore if the fixed transaction cost T is zero, and the&#13;
distribution function such that F[b] = F[rL+A-g] is very small so that there&#13;
is little risk of default or partial repayment even at C = 0, PB (L',r',O)&#13;
could be positive. This may be the situation for what are commonly referred&#13;
to as a bank's Prime Borrowers'.&#13;
We have a peculiar situation here in which the 'equilibrium'&#13;
(L',r'), with loan demand equated to supply, results in positive profits for&#13;
the bank. On the other hand the 'competitive equilibrium' (Lct rc) with zero&#13;
profits results in rationing. That is, the firm is willing to pay a higher&#13;
interest charge to get a larger loan size, to the left of PF along LF.      The&#13;
firm is better of at (Lcj rc), however, than it would be at (L', r') or at any&#13;
point on LF between these two points.&#13;
By setting a floor on the interest charged to prime borrowers, the&#13;
'Prime Rate Convention' referred to by many observers of the banking scene&#13;
could act as a collusive device to reduce (interest rate) competition for&#13;
these borrowers. This would tend to shift the 'equilibrium' point, closer to&#13;
(L', r'), with competition for prime borrowers diverted to provision of&#13;
facilities and services in loan and deposit transactions. In this case there&#13;
would be a hierarchy of prime borrowers, according to the implicit monopoly&#13;
profits that they bring at the floor rate. If tacit collusion is less than&#13;
perfect, rationing of prime borrowers would be observed. It has been shown&#13;
earlier that a rise in deposit interest rate i would raise r by shifting LB&#13;
and LF to the right. On the other hand a rise in the collusive floor - the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
prime rate - will take time to adjust, given the difficulties of tacit&#13;
collusion. 16/   Given the large gap between LF and LB at all r &lt; r', we should&#13;
observe an increase in rationing during such periods.&#13;
Hodgman (1961) has explained the phenomenon of prime borrowers,&#13;
prime rates and rationing by assuming a non-competitive market on the deposit&#13;
side, and collusive understanding between banks. Paradoxically the present&#13;
model shows that 'equilibrium' rationing will exist in the 'competitive' case&#13;
but not one in which there is perfect collusion on the loan side. Timberg and&#13;
Aiyer's (1980) study of informal bankers in India shows that they require&#13;
little formal collateral 17/ from many of their borrowers. The present model&#13;
suggests that these customers probably constitute their 'prime borrowers' just&#13;
as General Motors, Exxon etc. do for U.S. banks.&#13;
3.6 Loan Terms Under Monopoly&#13;
The analysis of the monopoly case given by equations (4), (5) and&#13;
PF = IF is essentially similar to the competitive case (see appendix 2). In&#13;
the competitive case, changes in deposit interest rate, bank and firm&#13;
transaction costs are negativelyi related to expected firm profits and changes&#13;
in equity are positively related to them. Here these changes are similarly&#13;
related to expected bank profit, but have no effect on firm profits. The&#13;
monopolist bank continues to extract the surplus generated by the loan&#13;
transaction; it cannot do better, as the firm would not take any loan if it&#13;
tried to do so.&#13;
There are some noteworthy differences, however. A change in the&#13;
fixed component of the bank's transaction cost has no effect on loan terms.&#13;
As before it reduces bank profits but here no compensating adjustment is&#13;
required as this just reduces the monopoly element. The bank variable&#13;
transaction cost component and the deposit rate or opportunity cost of bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
funds (i) are still positively related to the loan interest rate, but the&#13;
effect on collateral is now unambiguously negative. This is because a rise in&#13;
both these following from a rise in i or t, would lower firm profits below&#13;
those required to keep the firm in the loan market. This result provides a&#13;
potential test of the hypothesis of monopolist segmented markets. If i+t vary&#13;
across these markets, then the loan rate and collateral would tend to be&#13;
inversely related to each other; this will not necessarily be so if the&#13;
markets are competitive. The effect of differences in equity contributions by&#13;
firms on the loan interest rate and collateral are also different for the&#13;
competitive and monopoly situations. An increase in equity has an ambiguous&#13;
effect on loan rates for a monopoly but reduces them in a competitive&#13;
market. On the other hand the effect on collateral is negative for the&#13;
monopoly but ambiguous for the competitive market. A comparison of firms&#13;
(from a given region) which differ only in their equity contribution thus&#13;
provides a potential test for competition/monopoly. If the relation between&#13;
loan interest rates and equity is zero or positive and that between equity and&#13;
collateral is negative, this would indicate a monopoly situation. A&#13;
competitive market would be indicated if the relation between equity and&#13;
collateral is zero or positive but the relation between equity and interest is&#13;
negative. Given that optimal loan size is fixed under identical expectations,&#13;
the same test could be carried out using the equity/debt ratio instead of only&#13;
equity.&#13;
If we again consider the equity decision we find that in the&#13;
'competitive' or non-interlinked case, the results are as before. 18/&#13;
Interestingly, however, interlinking in the monopoly case does not require&#13;
that the two decisions be made simultaneously. By definition PF=2F and does&#13;
not change with equilibrium loan contract (L,r,C). Therefore the equity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
decision must be made prior to the loan decision and is the same as that for&#13;
the no-loan case (L=O). 19/   It is shown in appendix 2 that FPB/ E &gt; 0, so&#13;
that the bank's monopoly profits are high when the marginal cost of equity&#13;
funds is low and vice-versa. 20/ This has an interesting implicaion for the&#13;
case in which the monopolist is a village money lender, and the firm a poor&#13;
agriculturist with few sources of family funds. The rate of return on the&#13;
money lender's funds are likely to be less than earlier analysis has led us to&#13;
expect.&#13;

IV. DIFFERENTIAL EXPECTATIONS AS A CAUSE FOR INEFFICIENCY&#13;
4.1 The Degree of Inefficiency&#13;
The differential expectations case is defined by the condition that&#13;
the group of identical banks has a subjective distribution of returns differ-&#13;
ent from the subjective distribution of the group of identical firms. The&#13;
discussion will focus on the case in which the banks' subjective distribution&#13;
is characterized by greater pessimism than the firms' distribution. 11 The&#13;
formal analysis, however, covers the opposite case as well. The main reasons&#13;
for differential perceptions include assymetries in information availability&#13;
and knowledge, and the high cost to banks of obtaining more information.&#13;
Given the scope of the paper and limitations of space we will take these&#13;
differentials as given and investigate the consequences. 3/ This will be&#13;
followed by a discussion of cases in which such differentials are likely to be&#13;
significant and the type of policy intervention required.&#13;
With both the bank and the firm maximizing profits, the 'contract&#13;
curve' 4   is given by equations (2), (4) and (6):&#13;
XL    l+i+t                                                  (2)&#13;
X'L = 1+g'                                                   (4)&#13;
PB &gt; 0 and PF &gt; SF                                           (6)&#13;
As in the identical expectation case a competitive solution with zero expected&#13;
profits for banks at non-negative collateral may be impossible for some group&#13;
of firms. That is if we solve (2) and (4) for (L,r) given C, then PB(L,r,C)&gt;O&#13;
for C = 0. As in the previous section these would constitute the group of&#13;
'Prime Borrowers' or favored customers of any bank, and the analysis of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
previous section for these borrowers applies here also. 5/           For the rest of&#13;
the section we assume that PB(L,r,O) &lt; 0. If we solve (2) and (4) with the&#13;
first part of (6) holding with equality we obtain the competitive solution&#13;
(L,r,C) which delimits one end of the 'contract curve'. Similarly solving (2)&#13;
and (4) with the second part of (6) holding with equality, the Pseudo-monopoly&#13;
(monopolist acting as a price taker)!/ solution (               delimits the other&#13;
end. Implicitly differentiating (2) and (4) it can be shown (appendix 3)&#13;
that,&#13;

Equation (9') shows that the form of the curve is the same as HJ in&#13;
figure 5(a), and an index of the degree of 'monopoly' can be defined as&#13;
before. Equation (9) reveals a major difference from the identical expec-&#13;
tations case; the loan size is no longer invariant to the degree of&#13;
'monopoly'. Equations (9) and (10) show that the contract curve in (L,r)&#13;
space, H'J', must have one of two important forms, H"J" shown in figures 7(a)&#13;
and (b) below, where L* is the optimal loan size from figure 5(b), 7/&#13;

The right side of (9) shows that the occurance of one or the other&#13;
case is determined by the relative slopes of the demand and supply loci in&#13;
(r,C) space. As this also plays an important role in subsequent analysis it&#13;
is useful to examine it further. Using the differentials in appendix 1, and&#13;
including the iso-profit curves for the bank and firm, we obtain figures 8(a)&#13;
and 8(b) corresponding to 7(a) and 7(b).&#13;

The relative slopes of the bank and firm iso-profit curves for given&#13;
L are drawn on the assumption that the bank's subjective parameter e is&#13;
greater than the firm's subjective parameter e'. In this situaton the slope&#13;
of the former is greater than the latter. In the absence of formal proof one&#13;
can only speculate that the relative slopes of LBL and LF=L are similarly&#13;
linked to the pessimism parameters, so that the conventional case is more&#13;
likely for e &gt; O' and the unconventional for e &lt;     '.8     Note that for e &lt; 8',&#13;
H"J" in figure 7(b) lies entirely above L=L*, but has the same slope. 9/&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
The institutional literature contains many assertions that&#13;
monopolistic money lenders in rural areas are a major cause of agricultural&#13;
stagnation in developing countries. There is also often an explicit or&#13;
implicit assertion that the imperfect/non-competitive nature of developing&#13;
country credit markets are a major factor in underdevelopment. The above&#13;
analysis shows that if the bank's subjective 9 is greater than the&#13;
subjective i' of the firm and the slope of the loan supply curve is greater&#13;
than the loan demand curve in (r,C) space, a Pseudo-monopoly lender will make&#13;
smaller loans at higher levels of interest and collateral than a competitive&#13;
one. Further, given the analysis of the previous section, in this&#13;
'conventional' case the degree of 'monopoly' is directly related to the degree&#13;
of inefficiency. Thus the higher the degree of 'monopoly' the greater will be&#13;
the divergence between the marginal productivity of capital and the cost of&#13;
obtaining and transferring funds from savers to producers. If we make the&#13;
link from productivity to savings, investment and growth, the conventional&#13;
case with differential expectation does provide support for the institutional&#13;
hypothesis.&#13;
The 'unconventional case' leads to just the opposite conclusions. It&#13;
suggests that there may be cases, or groups of firms, for which 'monopoly' in&#13;
the loan market, is preferable to competition purely on efficiency grounds.&#13;
In terms of figure 7(b), what happens is that as C increases, the LF curve&#13;
shifts to the right by a greater amount than LB curve. This raises the loan&#13;
level, bringing it closer to the optimal level L*. 10/&#13;

4.2 Analysis of the Competitive Market under Differential Expectations&#13;
In the competitive case, expected bank profits are zero (PB = O,&#13;
(6'). The solution can be obtained by solving equations (2), (4) and (6'),&#13;
below.&#13;
X - (1+i+t)L - T = 0                                           (6')&#13;
For the purpose of analysis, we can totally differentiate and solve these&#13;
equations as in appendix 3. We will first deal with the conventional case of&#13;
figures 7(a) and 8(a) and then return to the qualifications and complications&#13;
introduced by the other case. For a change in the banks' subjective pessimism&#13;
factor e, we have (see appendix 3),&#13;
oL &lt;, l    ar &gt;O, lac Z0      and     F =        eY + X  &lt; O&#13;
where X0, the differential of X with e, is the change in the bank's&#13;
expectations of repayment due to a change in its subjective 0 . It is also&#13;
the direct effect of a change in 0 on the bank's expectation of profits.&#13;
Suppose we start from a position of identical expectations and increase the&#13;
bank's pessimism factor. In terms of the supply-demand diagram below,&#13;
L&#13;
LF (C)              LB (C *)&#13;
L ~ ~ ~  ~~~/L~&#13;

PB&gt;PB      B&#13;
r r&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
the original equilibrium is at (L*,r*,C*) with PB-0*.1!!     An increase in 0&#13;
shifts the supply curve LB southeast to L'B, tending to lower the loan amount&#13;
and raise the loan interest rate. Because of the direct negative effect of e&#13;
on PB(X, &lt; 0), it also shifts the bank's isoprofit curves so that PB is now&#13;
negative.  PB may be negative or positive, however, depending on whether the&#13;
increase in r under or over-compensates for the direct negative effect on&#13;
expected profits. If P'B &lt; 0, the collateral C must rise to raise profits to&#13;
zero. This shifts both supply and demand curves to the right, raising r and&#13;
reducing L further (conventional case equation 9), till equilibrium is re-&#13;
established at the intersection of L"B and L"F with P"B=O. If P'B &gt; 0&#13;
collateral must fall to establish the zero profit equilibrium. Both curves&#13;
shift to the left. This reverses to some extent the initial fall in loan size&#13;
and rise in loan interest rate, but still leaves the former below and the&#13;
latter above its initial value.&#13;
The differentials in (11) show that the greater the difference&#13;
between the bank's subjective e and that of the firm, the smaller the loan and&#13;
the higher the interest rate charged. Therefore the degree of inefficiency in&#13;
the loan market measured from the optimal position (L*,r*), is directly&#13;
related to the difference between the subjective expectations of the two.&#13;
Further, this is independent of any 'true' or objective e in the productive&#13;
activity, as long as it does not lead to the absence of the loan transaction&#13;
when the 'true O' would suggest that it should exist, or to the presence of&#13;
the transaction when the 'true O' suggests that it should not.&#13;
From the last differential in (11), we also see that the firm's&#13;
expectation of profits falls with the bank's subjective pessimism factor 0.&#13;
Eventually PF is reduced to Py, the expected profits of the firm in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
absence of any loan transaction. Any increase in e beyond this will lead to&#13;
the disappearance of the loan market for this group of firms. In terms of the&#13;
'contract curve', as e increases the gap between C and C is reduced with an&#13;
increase in e, till it becomes zero.      After this C &lt; C and the market ceases&#13;
to exist. In terms of the demand-supply loci there are three possibilties as&#13;
in figures 9(a), 9(b) and 9(c) below. If the firm's equity contribution is&#13;
greater than minimum capital requirements, the PF=1F point can occur for&#13;
positive or zero loan values, as shown in figures 9(a) and 9(b) respect-&#13;
ively. If the equity contribution is less than minimum capital i.e. E &lt; K,&#13;
the PF=PF point can occur at L &gt; K - E or at L=K - E, as shown in figures 9(a)&#13;
and 9(c) respectively.    In figures 9(b) and 9(c) what happens is that any&#13;
increase in e shifts the demand locus to a position L'B at which no&#13;

competitive equilibrium exists for PF &gt; 5 .      The above analysis shows that&#13;
differences between the firms' and banks' perceptions can lead banks not to-&#13;
lend to certain groups of firms, even if the actual or true 0 is even lower&#13;
than that perceived by the firm (implying that the true expected return is&#13;
even higher than that perceived by the firm itself).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.3 Absence of Credit Rationing in Free Markets&#13;
We turn next to a consideration of the question of credit rationing&#13;
which has been so popular in the literature. Framier and Gordon (1965),&#13;
Modigliani and Jaffee (1969) and others obtained a loan supply locus of the&#13;
type drawn in figure 4(b), and reproduced below as LB in figure 10(a), for the&#13;
identical expectations case. For rationing&#13;
Figure 10&#13;
L&#13;
BA\)                         LB.&#13;
to take place, LB must lie below LF so that the two curves do not intersect.&#13;
Consider first the identical expectations equilibrium of the previous&#13;
chapter. It was shown there that, as long as an interior solutions exists,&#13;
the supply (L.) and demand (LF) locii must intersect at L = L* where the&#13;
latter is defined by g'(L+E-k) = i+t. As this is independent of the&#13;
collateral C and the pessimism parameters of the bank and the firm (C) this&#13;
implies that the demand locus intersects L      L* for all C and i, and also that&#13;
the supply locus intersects L = L* for all C and e.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
Consider now the differential expectation equilibrium with a firm-&#13;
pessimism parameter i' and a bank pessimism parameter e ( e &gt; i' as above).&#13;
When e = i' a competitive, identical expectation equilibrium prevails at&#13;
(L*, r*, C*). As e is increased above i', the analysis shows that LB moves&#13;
vertically down, to Li while LF remains unchanged, and expected bank profits&#13;
become negative or positive.   We have shown, however, that LB must intersect&#13;
L = L* for all values of the pessimism parameter and in particular for 0.&#13;
Therefore LB continues to intersect LF. Now if expected bank profits have&#13;
become positive, collateral must fall to restore competitive equilibrium. The&#13;
analysis shows (appendix) that this must move the LF curve vertically up and&#13;
the LB curve vertically down. Thus the two curves must continue to intersect&#13;
in this case. On the other hand, if bank expected profits had become negative&#13;
collateral must increase. This shifts the two curves vertically in the&#13;
opposite direction.  We know, however, that both the LB and LF curves must&#13;
intersect L - L  for all C; therefore, LF can never be moved above L = L    or&#13;
LB below it. Therefore the two curves must have a point of intersection.&#13;
This shows that rationing equilibrium is ruled out if an interior maximum&#13;
exists, even though the market can go out of existence because of differential&#13;
expectations. The intuitive reason for this is quite simple: There are two&#13;
variables in the system (interest rate and collateral); these can always be&#13;
adjusted to equate demand and supply, while at the same time ensuring zero&#13;
expected profit for the bank. Alternatively, if collateral availability is&#13;
unconstrained, there is always a collateral value C = (1+r)LD which eliminates&#13;
all the risk for the bank and it has no hesitation in giving the requested&#13;
loan, so that this cannot exceed loan supply at the given terms.    Here r&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
adjusts to ensure that the competitive zero profit condition is met [r = T +&#13;
(i+t)LDi.&#13;
Before ruling out the possibility of rationing of individual&#13;
borrowers, it is useful to consider corner solutions, which we have not.&#13;
explicitly considered so far (except in footnotes). When firm equity E &gt; k,&#13;
the minimum capital requirement, no corner solution arises. If E &lt; k a corner&#13;
solution can arise if g'(o) &lt;     . This happens when i+t &gt; g'(o), for in this&#13;
case we must have L = Lmin = k-E. There are three possibilities: the bank's&#13;
maximization. has no interior solutions, the firm's maximization has no&#13;
interior solutions, and both have no interior solution. In the last case both&#13;
loan supply and loan demand equal Lmin so there is obviously no rationing. In&#13;
the first case loan demand is equal to Lmin. If the loan supply curve did not&#13;
intersect L = Lmin, it would have to lie entirely below it. This would imply&#13;
that the: total capital of the firm after getting the loan K = Ls + E &lt; Lmin +-&#13;
E = k. By definition of k, there can be no production and no loan repayment&#13;
in this case.   Therefore the bank would have no interest in making the loan or&#13;
the firm in taking it. Such a rationing equilibrium is self contradictory and&#13;
cannot occur.&#13;
Finally consider the case in which loan supply is given by L =&#13;
Lmin. In this case there are two possibilities as given in the following&#13;
figures:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

r'               r                    r        r&#13;
Therefore in this case a rationing equilibrium seems possible. The above&#13;
analysis shows that a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for rationing&#13;
to occur is that E &lt; k, g'(o) &lt; i+t, LB = Lmin (i.e., the bank does not have&#13;
an interior maximum, and firm has an interior maximum).&#13;
4.4 Implications for Long Term Loans, Lending to Small Entrepreneurs&#13;
and Loans for New products and Exports&#13;
Observers of the credit market in different countries have remarked&#13;
that the banking system seems to direct all its lending towards short term&#13;
commercial loans in the early stages of development. Even in more developed&#13;
countries the proportion of longer term investment loans rise only slowly and&#13;
often appears to governments to be 'inadequate'. We hypothesize that this may&#13;
be because the subjective 0 differential between firms and banks is positively&#13;
related to the period of the loan. One possible explanation is as follows:&#13;
the longer the term of the loan, the greater the possibility of non-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
standard economic conditions and novel external shocks occuring in the firm's&#13;
economic environment; these may adversely affect its mean or expected return&#13;
for the whole period. The firm's returns over the long term are therefore&#13;
more critically dependent on its adaptive abilities. The firm is likely to be&#13;
quite definite about its own abilities. For the bank on the other hand, this&#13;
will be an additional source of uncertainty which increases with the length of&#13;
the time period. A series of short term loans covering the entire long period&#13;
would on the other hand generate new information at each stage, and leave open&#13;
the possibility of a different decision. This would tend to make the&#13;
subjective 0 differential for short term loans less than for longer term&#13;
ones. Other things being equal, the model shows that this would lead to a&#13;
lower volume of long term loans at higher interest rates than for short term&#13;
loans.&#13;
Another fact relating to the organized banking system which has been&#13;
noted and questioned is the small proportion of its total loans going to small&#13;
entrepreneurs and firms. Given the size and importance-of the small scale&#13;
informal sector in developing countries it is not surprising that this is of&#13;
special concern to them. But even the United States still has a Small&#13;
Business Administration and special programs for providing loans to this&#13;
sector. In many countries the important difference between large and small&#13;
firms is that the former are public (or in some cases private) limited&#13;
companies. These firms are subject to with rules for maintenance of accounts,&#13;
internal and external auditing, and publication and dissemination of&#13;
performance results. The smaller firms usually have unlimited liability and&#13;
few such rules. In many developing countries they do not even maintain&#13;
systematic written accounts. We therefore expect the information assymetr 13/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
and consequently the subjective 9 differential between banks and firms to be&#13;
larger for small firms than for large ones. _L    Even if the small firm has-&#13;
definite written information which it communicates to the bank when it applies&#13;
for a loan, the bank's uncertainty about the quality of the information is&#13;
likely to be greater than in the case of a larger applicant. If this argument&#13;
is correct, the model suggests that small informal firms are likely to obtain&#13;
a less than optimal share of credit.&#13;
We would expect a similar variance in the bank-firm 9 differential&#13;
for old established and new firms. The former have a history of productive&#13;
activity which can, at least in principle, be drawn upon to make predictions&#13;
about the future. For the new firm no such history exists; the bank must&#13;
depend much more on its judgment of the adaptive and entrepreneural ability of&#13;
the firm. As suggested earlier the firm's own views on this are likely to be&#13;
much more definite than the bank's.    This would tend to produce a greater&#13;
subjective 9 differential between the bank and the new firm, resulting in&#13;
smaller loans to new firms.-L     An interesting and well established way of&#13;
countering this in LDCs is to use foreign collaboration or imports of foreign&#13;
technology from prominent firms in developed countries as implicit predictors&#13;
of future performance.&#13;
Parallel arguments relating to information assymetry, quality of in-&#13;
formation supplied by the firm, and uncertainty in judgment of ability, lead&#13;
us to expect significant differences between the subjective 9 parameter of&#13;
the bank and the firm in the following cases:&#13;
-- Firms engaging in modern industrial production in the early&#13;
stages of industrialization when the only experience of banks&#13;
is with traditional production, trade and agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
- Firms pioneering export of non-traditional manufactured&#13;
goods where exports have consisted of primary and traditional&#13;
goods.&#13;
-- Firms entering new industries like electronic and chemicals&#13;
in a country which has had only simple engineering and textile&#13;
manufacturing for sometime.&#13;
-- Firms using radically new technology to produce goods which have&#13;
been produced by a relatively static and tried technology 16/&#13;
To some extent, all these are disequilibrium phenomena and one can argue about&#13;
the length of time for which such a situation will prevail. The model shows,&#13;
however, that this involves non-optimal use of resources and lower&#13;
availability of credit to new and pioneering sub-sectors and sectors of the&#13;
economy which may be of vital interest to the government.&#13;
4.5 Policy Analysis&#13;
We turn next to a consideration of the policies which may be followed&#13;
to correct the inefficiency arising from a gap in subjective perceptions by&#13;
banks and firms. As noted earlier, the interest rate is higher and the loan&#13;
size lower under these conditions than in the optimal situation. Consider&#13;
first an interest ceiling. In figure 11(a) below, L* is the optimal loan&#13;
size, while the current equilibrium is at (L', r', C'). Analysis of the&#13;
demand supply equations (2) and (4) shows that     r &lt; 0,    &lt;         B and aB &gt; O.&#13;

competitive equilibrium at (L', r', C'), this shows that a ceiling on interest&#13;
rates at r &lt; r' would reduce bank profits to below zero. In the present model&#13;
this means that no 'demand-supply' equilibrium can exist. A 'rationing&#13;
equilibrium' can exist, however, as is shown in figure 11(b): a reduction in&#13;
the interest rate from r' to r shifts the demand and supply loci to the left,&#13;
to L'B and L'F respectively. This reduces expected bank profits to P'B &lt; 0.&#13;
To restore bank profits to zero, collateral requirements rise to C" at which&#13;
P1B=0. At rationing 'equilibrium', differentiation of equations (2) and (6)&#13;
shows that,&#13;
ac &lt;    aL &gt;   , apF &lt; O. &#13;
&lt; 0  -r &gt; 0, &#13;
Imposition of an interest rate ceiling moves the loan size further away from&#13;
optimum, while increasing collateral requirements and reducing the firm's&#13;
expectation of profits. The increased collateral requirement means that less&#13;
wealthy firms are now more likely to run into the collateral constraint,&#13;
cma. 17/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
Imposition of loan volume requirements on bank lending to this group&#13;
of firms is equivalent to prescription of minimum statutory loan size for each&#13;
member of the group. In terms of figure (12) below, let the loan size be&#13;
fixed at the optimal value L*. If the collateral level is unchanged, banks'&#13;
Figure 12&#13;
Lr    E,"   r'           r&#13;
L'&#13;
LF (r, c' ~ ~ LF r,C"&#13;
expected profits would be negative. Therefore the collateral level rises,&#13;
shifting both curves to the right and raising expected bank profits. However,&#13;
our earlier analysis showed that the equilibrium loan size falls with&#13;
collateral, so that a demand-supply equilibrium is not possible given that&#13;
L=L* is statutorily required. The solution is therefore given by equations&#13;
(4) and (6) which show that,&#13;
a   aL  &gt; saL&lt;Â°&#13;
One such solution is shown in figure 12 as the intersection of P'B=o and L'F&#13;
with 8L- &gt; O. An equilibrium with arL &lt; O would result if expected bank prof its&#13;
respond very strongly to increases in collateral. In this case, only a small&#13;
increase in C is required to restore expected bank profits to zero, and&#13;
'equilibrium' is at r &lt; r'. Loan volume requirements can therefore restore&#13;
the optimal loan size, but are accompanied by a rise in collateral require-&#13;
ments. These have the unintended effect of reducing expected firm profits,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
and to that extent harming the firms they are designed to help. 1!, Note also&#13;
that if PF is reduced below _F, this group would be completely eliminated from&#13;
the market.&#13;
To consider the effect of interest subsidies and taxes, let r be the&#13;
interest paid by the firm and r+r, that received by the bank, where r5 is the&#13;
subsidy. Therefore r is replaced by r+r, in the bank's equations. If we&#13;
solve the modified equations (2), (4) and (6), differentiating as before&#13;
(appendix 3) we obtain,&#13;
aaLr&gt;    Â°     &lt;o,                F&gt; &#13;
An interest rate subsidy therefore raise the loan size, reduces the interest&#13;
charged to the firm and raises firm expected profits, thus moving these vari-&#13;
able towards their values in the optimal, identical expectations, case.        The&#13;
interest subsidy also lowers collateral requirements and will move them&#13;
towards or away from the identical expectations case, as 8C/8        0.&#13;
Interestingly a lump sum subsidy for lending to this group of firms&#13;
has the same effect. This is seen by carrying out the analysis for the fixed&#13;
portion of bank transaction cost T. We have (appendix 3),&#13;
aT &lt; Â° 0 T &gt;     - aT &gt; 0  aT  &lt; o. L9&#13;
Thus a lump sum subsidy also raises the loan size and the firm's expected&#13;
profits while lowering the loan interest rate and collateral level. The&#13;
choice between either of these two subsidy policies, and the loan floor policy&#13;
must therefore be based purely on equity considerations. This choice could be&#13;
modified when an interior solution does not exist due to collateral restric-&#13;

tions. 20/&#13;
Governments have often used credit restrictions and credit limits for&#13;
specific groups of borrowers. There is one situation in which this could be&#13;
justified(2nd best optimum). Consider an economy in which there is one group&#13;
of firms for which bank-firm subjective expectations are identical or almost&#13;
so. If the rest of the borrowers have a significantly greater but&#13;
undifferentiated or undifferentiable subjective 0 gap, a reduction in loan&#13;
size to the first group would tend to equalize expected marginal product of&#13;
loans among all borrowers. Consider a loan ceiling L=E &lt; L* in terms of the&#13;
diagram.below. The unconstrained equilibrium is such that PB=0 and P"B &lt; 0,&#13;
so that a competitive rationing equilibrium at (E, r) is ruled out.     Solution&#13;
of equation (2) and (6) shows that&#13;

An increase in collateral shifts both curves to the right till the supply&#13;
curve L'B intersects L=T at a point at which expected bank profits P'B are&#13;
zero. Thus the rise in collateral is exactly compensated for by a fall in the&#13;
interest rate. Expected firm profits are however reduced in the process.&#13;

4.6  Comparative Studies:   Similarities and Differences from Identical&#13;
Expectations&#13;
We turn next to a brief consideration of the effect of exogenous&#13;
changes on the differential expectation equilibrium. The effect of changes in&#13;
deposit interest, bank variable transaction cost, bank fixed transaction cost&#13;
and firm transaction cost are essentially similar. The only difference is the&#13;
effect of changes in the last two on loan size. In the identical expectations&#13;
case, changes in T and A have no effect on loan size. In the differential&#13;
expectations case, the bank's fixed transaction cost T is negatively related&#13;
to L, so that the greater the T the more is the divergence of L from optimal-&#13;
ity. This means that high levels of transaction costs will accentuate the&#13;
ineffiency resulting from the bank's higher subjective risk factor. This&#13;
suggests that the lump sum subsidy policy considered earlier may be preferable&#13;
on practical grounds, 21/ when a high T occurs along with a high risk&#13;
differential. The effect of firm transaction costs on loan size is&#13;
ambiguous. Policy intervention cannot therefore be justified purely on&#13;
analytical grounds.&#13;
The effect of equity changes on all three variable (L, r, C) is&#13;
ambiguous in this case.   Moreover 6P F/E   # g', so that the discussion of&#13;
interlinkages between equity and loan markets does not apply here. It is&#13;
interesting briefly to consider a special type of technical change, which does&#13;
not change the minimum capital stock K and the associated base distribution of&#13;
returns F(y). If we replace g by kg we can analyze the effect of natural&#13;
technical change which affects only X. This may be a useful approximation of&#13;
new technology in agriculture in whose introduction working capital for&#13;
fertilizer etc. plays a major role. In the identical expectations case we&#13;
have Xg'(L+E-K) = i+t, so that the effect of an increase in X is to raise the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
equilibrium loan size. In the differential expectations case we find that&#13;
this effect is ambiguous. 11/ Therefore technical change dould result in a&#13;
decrease in loan size, moving the group of firms further away from optimality,&#13;
and making government intervention more necessary.&#13;
4.7 Effects of Collateral Non-availability on Loans and Policy Prescriptions&#13;
Throughout this section we have assumed that the maximum acceptable&#13;
collateral Cma is sufficiently large for an interior solution to exist. In&#13;
figure 13, the unconstrained solution is (L, r, C), with PB=o.    If Cma &lt; C,&#13;
this shifts both curves to the left to a position such as L'F and L'B. We&#13;
Figure 13 (a)                             Figure 13 (b)&#13;
L                                         L&#13;
know from earlier analysis that aPB/ a     0 so that    &lt; 0, and a competitive&#13;
PI,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#13;
demand-supply equilibrium cannot exist. An 'excess-supply' equilibrium may or&#13;
may not exist, however. Figure 13(a) shows a case in which equilibrium can be&#13;
obtained by raising r sufficiently to a point at which the bank's expectation&#13;
of profits become zero (P"B=O). On comparison with figure 13(b) it is clear&#13;
that a necessary condition for this is that the slope of the P"B=O curve be&#13;
more negative than that of the L'F(r, Cma) curve. That is&#13;
Xr         XL&#13;
X 1 -i t &lt; 8" --_Lr.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
Given this condition we can solve equations (4) and (6) to get&#13;
aL &gt; 0 -r &lt; 0    PK &lt; 0.&#13;
Therefore if GCa &lt; C this will reduce the loan amount further below its&#13;
optimal value.  This would be accompanied by a rise in the loan interest rate&#13;
and a fall in the firm's expected profits.&#13;
Consider a group of firms which are identical except for the amount&#13;
of acceptable collateral they can offer. There are several possible reasons&#13;
why Cma may differ between firms even when equity contribution E and minimum&#13;
capital K are identical. An important factor is differences in wealth held in&#13;
assets which do not form part of the productive enterprise under&#13;
consideration. Thus we expect poorer firms or individuals to have lower&#13;
acceptable collateral than richer ones. When collateral may be partially made&#13;
up of, e.g., an entrepreneur's residence, its effective value may be much less&#13;
than the market value in countries where courts would hesitate to make&#13;
individuals homeless. Similarly, if collection costs are higher for certain&#13;
borrowers such as unincorporated firms, the effective value of the collateral&#13;
may be lowered. Another factor affecting collateral that is external to the&#13;
firm is the marketability of the assets owned, and in extreme cases the&#13;
existence or non-existence of a market for certain assets: The same land in an&#13;
isolated area may constitute less Cma than in a non-isolated one, as may a&#13;
house in a rural as opposed to an urban area; the collateral value of a&#13;
tractor may differ quite markedly before and after the green revolution as a&#13;
general market comes into being. Relative uncertainty about the market value&#13;
of an asset may also lower Cma, given our assumption of collateral as having a&#13;
definite floor value. Finally, an assured or permanent source of income may&#13;
be considered acceptable collateral in some situations but not in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
others.-L     The results show that less well endowed firms will receive&#13;
smaller loans at higher interest rates than better endowed ones, and will&#13;
consequently have lower expected profits. This relationship will of course no&#13;
longer apply when acceptable collateral exceeds the unconstrained equilibrium&#13;
level C.&#13;
This analysis also has implications for international capital&#13;
markets. First consider borrowing by governments in international capital&#13;
markets. In these markets, economically strong developed countries like the&#13;
U.S.A., Germany and Japan constitute prime borrowers for whom optimal&#13;
collateral may be close to zero, so that they can borrow freely and&#13;
efficiently. Next consider less developed countries, for whom the optimal&#13;
collateral can vary from zero to the total size of the loan plus interest.&#13;
There is no international authority to enforce collateral agreements between&#13;
countries, however, so we can expect collateral to be constrained to zero.&#13;
The model thus suggests that developing countries will get suboptimal loans at&#13;
higher interest rates than is the case for developed countries.&#13;
Now consider the case of an LDC which opens itself to the&#13;
international capital markets and allows free capital movements for the first&#13;
time. It has been observed in many cases that public sector firms are the&#13;
first and sometimes the only firms to have access to loans from international&#13;
banks. As any default by these companies would reflect on the international&#13;
credit-worthiness of the government, foreign banks expect a government to bail&#13;
them out in case of potential default. In effect the government provides an&#13;
implicit collateral which allows these firms to operate efficiently using&#13;
international funds. Since other similar but privately owned companies do not&#13;
have this implicit collateral, they are in a position where collateral is&#13;
constrained, and where loans are consequently smaller and interest rates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
higher. Thus the differential between international and local loan interest&#13;
rates for non-public firms can remain high despite the predictions of neo-&#13;
classical trade/capital theory.&#13;
The most direct policy to overcome the inefficiency caused by&#13;
collateral constraints in domestic banks' internal lending is to institute&#13;
government supported guarantee programs. Two types of guarantees which have&#13;
the same effect are as follows: the government promises to pay the bank a&#13;
lump sum CO in case of default, or it agrees to pay the bank an extra&#13;
proportion s of the collateral obtained from the firm. It is easily shown&#13;
that in the unconstrained equilibrium case we have (appendix 3),&#13;
&gt; 0,  Or   &lt; O,      &lt;        F  = xC &gt; Â°&#13;
0           0          0          0&#13;
These signs are the same as those for the constrained solution. As we would&#13;
expect, the guarantee substitutes perfectly for the lack of acceptable colla-&#13;
teral. If the policy maker cannot distinguish between firms with different&#13;
amounts of collateral then the better endowed and particularly those who&#13;
already have sufficient collateral would seem to obtain an unintended bene-&#13;
fit. Loan size rises, however, and this produces a gain in effiency as long&#13;
as the loan size remains below its optimal level.&#13;
Interestingly this policy could be used instead of a lump sum subsidy&#13;
policy even when there is an interior solution with no firm having inadequate&#13;
collateral. Comparison of the differentials above with those in equation (12)&#13;
shows that the directional effect on all variables is identical whether there&#13;
is a default subsidy or a lump sum subsidy. In principle one could determine&#13;
from the equations which policy requires less government expenditure and&#13;
choose between the two on that basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
It is useful to consider how the effects of the policies discussed&#13;
earlier are modified if collateral constraints become effective. Assume for&#13;
analytical convenience that before the policy intervention an unconstrained&#13;
solution exists. Consider first the imposition of interest ceilings. As&#13;
analyzed earlier in figure 11(a) and 11(b), a rationing equilibrium would&#13;
require a rise in collateral and a fall in L.    If a collateral ceiling becomes&#13;
effective, a competitive equilibrium cannot be established and no loans would&#13;
be made as banks would expect negative profits. Therefore imposition of an&#13;
interest ceiling would hurt the less endowed most, by eliminating them from&#13;
the loan market. The same thing happens in the case of a statutory minimum&#13;
loan size requirement as analyzed in figure 12.    Reframing this policy in&#13;
terms of the total loan volume allocated to this group of firms provides a&#13;
somewhat different effect. A forced balance is established at the&#13;
intersection of the L=L* and L'F(r,Cma) curves, at a lower interest rate and&#13;
with negative expected bank profits.    In effect, the government forces an&#13;
income transfer, in terms of income expectations, from the banks to the&#13;
firms.  Interestingly, the lower the firm's acceptable collateral, the greater&#13;
the income transfer that it receives, so that the least well endowed benefit&#13;
most. If the government has incomplete information about the number of people&#13;
in the group and the optimal size of loan, it will not be able to police the&#13;
requirements adequately. In this case the banks will seek out the well&#13;
endowed and lend first to them. If this volume of lending is sufficient to&#13;
meet statutory requirements, no funds will go to the poorer firms.&#13;
Both the interest subsidy and lump sum subsidy policies reduce&#13;
collateral requirements. Therefore the collateral constraint cannot come into&#13;
operation if it did not exist before. On the contrary these policies would&#13;
tend to eliminate the constraint if it had existed before.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
4.8 The Unconventional Case&#13;
This completes the discussion of the conventional case. We turn&#13;
briefly to the unconventional case of figures 7(b) and 8(b). The difference&#13;
between these cases is best illustrated by considering the contrary effect of&#13;
a change in bank fixed transaction cost T on the equilibrium value. Consider&#13;
an equilibrium (L, r, C). An increase in T has no effect on the demand-supply&#13;
curves, but makes bank expected profits negative. The only way in which&#13;
equilibrium can be restored is through a rise in C. In terms of the demand-&#13;
supply curves such as those in figures 7(a) or 7(b), both curves must move to&#13;
the right, thus also raising interest rates. In general, the loan value may&#13;
rise or fall. What actually happens is clear from figures 8(a) and 8(b),&#13;
where the original equilibrium is at the intersection of the LB and LF curves&#13;
with PB1 = 0. The rise in T makes PB1 &lt; 0, so that restoration of zero&#13;
expected profits requires movement to the northeast to a curve such as PB2.&#13;
From appendix 1 we know that in (r, C) space a fall in L moves curve LB=L to&#13;
the southeast and curve LF=L to the northwest. Therefore if LB and LF are to&#13;
intersect at PB1, as they must in equilibrium, L must fall in the conventional&#13;
case of figure 8(a) and rise in the unconventional case of 8(b). The effect&#13;
of changes in the deposit interest rate i or in the bank's subjective risk&#13;
factor e can be explained along similar lines. The only difference is that in&#13;
both cases there is an initial movement of the supply curve LB to the south-&#13;
east in (L, r) space tending to reduce L. This means that there is an extra&#13;
term which is always negative. This reinforces the signs in the conventional&#13;
case but provides a contrary term in the unconventional case. Therefore for&#13;
the unconventional case we have,&#13;
aL  &lt;     (L 0&#13;
M io,     30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
The directional effect on r, C and PF are identical in the two cases.&#13;
In the unconventional case we thus have two sub-cases. When -L &gt; 0,&#13;
differential expectations lead to inefficiency due to excessive loan size.&#13;
Paradoxically, however, a lump sum subsidy is still the right policy for&#13;
restoring optimality, as OL/bT is now positive. When UL/0 &lt; 0 inefficiency&#13;
is due to sub-optimal loan size as in the conventional case, but the correct&#13;
policy is just the inverse. That is a lump sum tax must now be imposed to&#13;
restore optimality. 24/&#13;
4.9 The Pseudo-Monopoly Solution&#13;
To round of this discussion we contrast the pseudo-monopoly solution&#13;
with the competitive solution (conventional case). The 'monopoly' equilibrium&#13;
is obtained by solving equations (2), (4) and (13).&#13;
PF = L+y+g-A-X =PF                                           (13)&#13;
We can totally differentiate and solve these equations to obtain the effect of&#13;
exogenous changes (appendix 4). The effect of changes in the deposit interest&#13;
rate or the opportunity cost of funds i and the transaction cost factor t, are&#13;
aT &lt;       - ai &gt; Â°,  ai &lt; 0,   ai  &gt; 0.&#13;
There is a noteworthy difference from the competitive case: 25/ the collateral&#13;
value is here (unambiguously) negatively related to i and t. This means that&#13;
in 'monopolistic' markets, changes in the cost of bank funds will have an&#13;
opposite effect on loan interest rates and collateral. This provides a par-&#13;
tial test, as in competitive markets they will not be consistently related. A&#13;
similar contrast arises for changes in the banks subjective pessimism factor&#13;
0. We have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
aL &lt; 0, aao &gt; o,    ac, &lt; 0,  asB &lt; Â°.&#13;
This means that the greater the difference in subjective pessimism between the&#13;
bank and the firm, the lower the collateral required, as the higher interest&#13;
rate more than compensates for it. 26/    This provides a potential test of the&#13;
model, if we can identify groups with different subjective 0 gaps, and&#13;
markets with different degrees of 'monopoly'. In the competitive case r and C&#13;
will not be consistently related across groups, while in the monopoly case&#13;
they will be inversely related.&#13;
As expected bank profits are inversely related to the 0 differential,&#13;
this would provide. a positive incentive to close the gap, if objective or true&#13;
0 is lower than the bank's. Thus the 0 differential is more likely to be&#13;
eliminated in the 'monopoly' situation than in the competitive one.&#13;
Changes in the bank transaction cost T have no effect on the&#13;
'monopoly' equilibrium. They merely modify the degree of 'monopoly'&#13;
profits. In the competitive case however, we expect an inverse relationship&#13;
between the loan interest rate and the collateral for different groups of&#13;
firms for which T changes. As changes in T only affect expected bank&#13;
'monopoly' profits, a lump sum subsidy is totally ineffective in moving loan&#13;
size towards the optimal. The effect of interest rate ceilings and minimum&#13;
loan requirements are, however, almost identical to those under competition.&#13;
27/ The only difference is that any fall in expected income affects the bank&#13;
rather than the firm. Finally, the effect of collateral limitations and the&#13;
nature of the interior maximum are again almost identical to those in the&#13;
competitive case, and the discussion of that case applies here also.&#13;
&#13;

V. COMPETITIVE MONOPOLY AS THE GENERAL MARKET FORM&#13;
5.1 The Formal Model&#13;
In the previous chapters we have made the simplifying assumption that&#13;
all banks are identical and have the same subjective judgment of uncer-&#13;
tainty.  In the present chapter we will selectively relax these assumptions&#13;
and point the direction towards a general model. As before we consider the&#13;
loan market for a group of identical firms, where the number of firms could be&#13;
one or more. There are n banks, where n &gt; 2. We consider a competitive&#13;
market, where 'competitive' is defined in terms of price taking behavior. We&#13;
will also assume that an interior solution exists. For simplicity we consider&#13;
only the conventional case with all the banks' subjective pessimism greater&#13;
than or equal to that of the firms'.Consider the case in which all the.banks&#13;
are identical except in their subjective judgment of 0 . That is each has a&#13;
different pessimism factor for the given group of firms. We can order the&#13;
banks in such a way that   01 &lt; 02 &lt; 03 .... &lt; 0 . For the present we will&#13;
assume that 01 is less than 02' and 02    less than 03.   The analysis of the&#13;
last section suggests the nature of the equilibrium that will prevail. We had&#13;
for the competitive and pseudo-monopoly cases:&#13;
Competitive Case:      bL &lt;      r &gt; O     c &gt; O     F &lt; O              (14)&#13;
Pseudo-monopoly Case: 6L        br &gt; OB                                 (15)&#13;
Consider any firm from the group of firms.    Let P   be its hypothetical&#13;
expected profits if the loan contract (Li, ri, Ci) between it and the bank was&#13;
determined in such a way that each bank acted as a 'perfect competitor.' That&#13;
is it determined its optimal loan supply by taking loan rate and collateral as&#13;

given, and then let the collateral be determined by the condition that its&#13;
expectation of profits is zero. Then from (14) it is clear that&#13;
PF1 &gt; PF2 &gt;       &gt; P...&gt;Fn                                    (14)&#13;
Recalling our discussion of the contract-curve in earlier sections, (Lj, r,&#13;
Cj) is the most attractive contract that bank i can offer any firm in the&#13;
group. That is the bank cannot increase the firm's profit expectations above&#13;
PFi without making its own expected profits negative, and consequently loosing&#13;
any interest in making a loan. Given all the assumptions made above and those&#13;
made for the uniqueness of the identical expectations equilibrium we have:&#13;
Theorem 1:     A Nash equilibrium exists, having the following charac-&#13;
teristics: all firms in the group take a loan from bank 1, the&#13;
terms of the loan being determined by what may be called com-&#13;
petitive monopoly. This is defined by the equations,&#13;
PF2 = L+y+g-A-X'&#13;
X1L = I+i+t                                          (16)&#13;
X'L = 1+g'&#13;
where X1 is Bank l's expectation of repayment, and X1L the dif-&#13;
ferential of Xi with respect to loan size L.&#13;
Proof:         From (14') and the following discussion no other bank is&#13;
prepared to offer a contract for which firm expectation of&#13;
profits PF are greater than PF2. Therefore Bank 1 does not need&#13;
to offer PF &gt; PF2. Bank 1 cannot offer a contract for which&#13;
firm expected profits PF are less than PF2 as bank 2 could then&#13;
offer                      P q&#13;
offer a quasi-monopoly contract with +PF2-           ' where n is&#13;
F  F  ~ n&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
any number greater than one.   Clearly PF2 &gt; pF &gt; p    and from our&#13;
discussion of contract curve, we know that aP B/ac = - aP F/ac &gt; 1&#13;
so that the PB corresponding to this contract must be&#13;
positive.  Therefore bank 1 must ensure PF=PF2.    Given this&#13;
constraint bank 1 obtains optimal profits from the contract&#13;
given by the solution of the set of equations (16), and has no&#13;
incentive to change it (as long as it is a price taker).&#13;
Corollary 1: The terms of the loan contract are independent of the subjective&#13;
0 parameters of banks 3 to n. Elimination of one of these&#13;
banks from the market does not affect the terms of the contract&#13;
for the group of firms under consideration.    Entry of another&#13;
bank with subjective risk factor greater than that of banks one&#13;
and two similarly does not affect the loan terms for this&#13;
group. This follows from the fact that equations (16) do not&#13;
contain any parameters affected by these actions.&#13;
Corollary 2: The greater the subjective 9 of bank 2 the greater will be&#13;
the expected monopoly profits of bank 1 as long as this&#13;
pessimism factor does not exceed that of bank 3. This follows&#13;
from equation (14) as 6P F2/M2 &lt; 0 and from (16)&#13;
where 6P I/P     &lt; 0.&#13;
Bi   F2&#13;
Corollary 3: The lower is the subjective 0 of bank 1 the higher will be&#13;
its expectation of profit. The solution of (16) essentially&#13;
yields (15), from which oP   /be &lt; o 2/&#13;
Bi   1&#13;
Theorem 2:     If Â°1 = Â°2, then the Nash equilibrium reduces to the perfectly&#13;
competitive differential expectations equilibrium of the last&#13;
section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
If Â°1 = Â°2, PF2=PF1, and from the definition of PF1' PB1=o0 Note that the&#13;
equilibrium contract is still unique, but each firm of the group may take the&#13;
loan from either bank 1 or bank 2. Further corrolary 1 continues to apply.&#13;
5.2 The Process of Reaching Equilibrium&#13;
One can think of several scenarios, which would lead to the estab-&#13;
lishment of the equilibrium of theorem 1. The simplest is a repeated market&#13;
or repeated play of the implicit game. The shorter the term of the loan, the&#13;
more numerous are the potential replications. In fact as much as two-thirds&#13;
of short term commercial loans in the USA are repeat loans. At the other&#13;
extreme long term investment loans are for more or less unique projects which&#13;
are very unlikely to be replicated. For short term repeat loans we would also&#13;
expect a gradual convergence between the subjective distribution of the firm&#13;
and the bank making the loan because of the accumulation of information and&#13;
knowledge. In the context of theorem 1 we expect bank ls subjective pessimism&#13;
factor to approach that of the firm. However there is no inherent reason to&#13;
expect a similar convergence between the pessimism factors of the other banks&#13;
and the firm. From (15) we would therefore expect a gradual rise in loan&#13;
size, collateral and bank expected profits, 1' and a fall in the loan interest&#13;
rate.&#13;
A more direct scenario is suggested by the 'contract curve'. For any&#13;
given bank, 0 is fixed so that the division of equilibrium expected profits&#13;
between bank and firm is determined by the collateral value. If banks start&#13;
with a high value of C and progressively reduce it to offer more attractive&#13;
expected profits to firms in the group, these eventually rise to PF2. At this&#13;
point only banks 1 and 2 are left in the competition for these firms. A mar-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
ginal reduction in C attracts them to bank 1, at the contract given by&#13;
equation (16). This procedure is equivalent to a competitiv.e auction. 4/&#13;
If there is no cost to renegotiation of contract, an alternative is a&#13;
very simple two stage process. In the first stage the banks bid as perfect&#13;
competitors to establish which bank will give loans to the group of firms. In&#13;
the second stage the winning bank readjusts the loan terms till the group is&#13;
on the verge of switching to the next most competitive bank (bank 2).&#13;
5.3 Implications for Credit Markets&#13;
The above model provides a partial explanation of phenomenon observed&#13;
in developing countries and in the early stages of development generally.&#13;
Despite the fact that there are moneylenders and money lending operations in&#13;
virtually all villages of an agricultural economy, there has been a continuing&#13;
suspicion of 'monopolistic interest rates'. This has been hypothesized as due&#13;
to fragmentation of the credit market, and sometimes due to collusion. The&#13;
meaning of fragmentation is not well defined especially if the moneylender or&#13;
borrower does not have much difficulty in physical movement between the com-&#13;
munities. On the other hand the extent and quality of information available&#13;
to the moneylenders is likely to be quite different, with superior information&#13;
available in most cases about potential borrowers in the community in which he&#13;
resides. 6/ The gap in subjective perceptions between lender and borrower&#13;
from the same village community will be lower than for one from different&#13;
communities. This will give rise to quasi-monopoly profits as suggested by&#13;
Theorem 1 and corrolary 2. In effect the important 'fragmentation' is in the&#13;
flow of information.&#13;
Consider what happens when a metropolitan or urban based bank opens a&#13;
rural branch or is forced by government to do so. From corollary 1 we know&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
that if its subjective 0 factor is greater than that of the actual lenders&#13;
and their closest competitors (i.e. Banks 1 and 2), there will be no effect on&#13;
the given set of borrowers. 7/   This seems often to be the case for a large&#13;
subset of potential rural borrowers and in particular the small farmers, given&#13;
these banks' poor knowledge of farming operations, and their lack of&#13;
information about particular farmers. If the new banks' subjective 0 is&#13;
higher than that of the actual lenders but lower than that of other&#13;
competitors we would observe a reduction in quasi-monopoly profits of&#13;
moneylenders. Note however that the bank will still get no business from this&#13;
group. Only in cases in which it has the lowest subjective 0 , as seems to&#13;
happen most often for the largest farmers, will it attract customers from the&#13;
moneylenders.&#13;
This suggests that a more appropriate government policy would be to&#13;
encourage potential bankers within the community to become active as&#13;
bankers. An instructive example of a case in which this happened naturally,&#13;
comes from the green revolution in North India. -8   Large farmers who intro-&#13;
duced new technology continued to have a demand for outside credit to intro-&#13;
duce further innovation despite an increase in their income. Farmers with&#13;
medium size holdings who also went in for the new technology also had an in-&#13;
crease in income. They were unable to introduce further innovations however&#13;
because of economies of scale of minimum capital requirements. Left with&#13;
surplus funds they became bankers to the neighboring smaller farmers who were&#13;
unable to obtain sufficient credit from outside sources. In terms of our&#13;
model, these farmers would have almost perfect information about other farmers&#13;
operating in the neighboring fields, and therefore virtually identical&#13;
expectations. Therefore they would completely displace other bankers by&#13;
offering better terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
An alternative policy would be to encourage or subsidize activity by&#13;
the urban banks which would tend to reduce the gap between their subjective&#13;
perceptions and those of the farmers'. This would be particularly useful in&#13;
areas where the existing moneylenders also have a wide gap, because of lack of&#13;
knowledge about the new agricultural technology. We expect such a gap to&#13;
arise between a progressive farmer who is convinced about the value of new&#13;
technology and a traditional moneylender whose experience is still limited to&#13;
lending for traditional agriculture. One way to reduce the perception gap is&#13;
sugested by the innovative experience of the Syndicate Bank in India. 9/ This&#13;
bank recruited personnel with strong local ties and consequently general&#13;
knowledge, as well as graduates of agricultural universities. The latter had&#13;
the explicit purpose of educating farmers in the new technology and helping&#13;
them implement it. In terms of the present model what is of equal if not&#13;
greater importance is the supply of information which it generates. This can&#13;
reduce bank subjective pessimism and bring it closer to the former's, thus&#13;
leading to larger loans at better terms.&#13;
In many developing countries we observe an informal banking sector&#13;
which lends almost exclusively to small entrepreneurs and traders, but is&#13;
restricted to small sub-sets of it. 10/ On the other hand the organized&#13;
banking system appears to direct a very small proportion of loans in this&#13;
direction, and lends largely to large organized firms. From the above model&#13;
this is what we would expect if the informal sector had a smaller subjective&#13;
0 differential for the given sub-sets of small firms, while the organized&#13;
banks had a smaller 0 differential for large organized firms. -i/ Timberg&#13;
and Aiyer's (1980) study suggests that many informal bankers have their&#13;
origins in and are often restricted in their operation to very specific groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
of firms. Some of these are caste or community based, while others are based&#13;
in special markets like the food grain or shoe markets. These special social&#13;
and information links would result in a virtual congruence of their and the&#13;
firms' subjective perceptions. On the other hand formal banks and large firms&#13;
have organizations and procedures which are very similar. Both are&#13;
characterized by formal organization and accounting procedures. The banks&#13;
have formalized methods of evaluation while the firms have publicly audited&#13;
and published account as discussed in an earlier section. This means that the&#13;
ability to communicate information is much greater between organized banks and&#13;
firms than between formal banks and informal firms. Therefore the identity of&#13;
expectations is greater in the first case, and is likely to be greater than&#13;
for informal banks and organized industry. By the same reasoning if organized&#13;
banks lend at all to medium-small firms it will be to the more organized and&#13;
modernized ones.&#13;
In the last section we suggested certain policy measures to reduce&#13;
inefficiency due to the risk differential between formal banks and small&#13;
firms. An alternative policy may be to encourage informal banks to extend&#13;
their sphere of operation. However this has to be done with selectivity&#13;
because some of these banks may be limited in their operation by the special&#13;
links mentioned above. The government should try and identify informal banks&#13;
or potential banks with special knowledge or special links to firms in&#13;
industry subgroups in which the problem of differential expectations exists.&#13;
Thus government may encourage exporters or owners of high technology firms to&#13;
set up banks to serve firms in these areas. Similarly it might set up a&#13;
specialized export-import bank or a high technology bank. This would also&#13;
provide a rationale for setting up industrial development banks in newly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
industrializing countries, and for linking industrial consultancy with loans&#13;
to small manufacturing firms in existing trade oriented banks.&#13;
Hodgman (1961), Kane and Malkiel and others have emphasized the&#13;
deposit relationship and requirements to keep countervailing deposits when&#13;
taking loans as a source of oligopoly profits. In the present model we assume&#13;
a perfect market on the deposit side so that no such oligopoly profits can&#13;
arise. However deposits can be an important source of information on the&#13;
inflows, outflows and incomes of the potential borrower.. Further, banks have&#13;
an interest in insuring that existing deposits are not transferred elsewhere&#13;
as they will act as an information source to the competing bank. From&#13;
corollary 2 we know that this will reduce the banks' profits from loans to the&#13;
depositor firm if the difference in judgment (about 0) between the firm and&#13;
the competing bank is reduced. L2/ By the same reasoning firms may have an&#13;
incentive to maintain deposits at two banks, though the increased transaction&#13;
costs make it unlikely in most cases.&#13;
An interlocking directorate between a bank and a potential borrower,&#13;
may similarly act as an expectation differential reducing factor. We would&#13;
expect such firms to borrow almost exclusively from the interlocking bank&#13;
which is able to offer it the best terms given its access to more and better&#13;
information. The bank in turn would earn quasi-monopoly profits.&#13;
5.4 Role of Transaction costs&#13;
In view of the importance given to transaction costs in earlier dis-&#13;
cussions, i3/ we briefly consider another special model in which banks have&#13;
identical risk perceptions, but have different fixed transaction costs. We&#13;
can again order the banks such that T1 &lt; T2 &lt; T3 &lt; ..- &lt; Tn. Similarly we can&#13;
define a perfectly competitive solution, which yields profits PFi' PF1 &gt; PF2 &gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
PF3 &gt;   &gt; PFn' to any firm which takes a loan from bank i at the perfectly&#13;
competitive terms. Theorems 1 and 2 and their corollaries go through exactly&#13;
as before. These continue to apply if we individually allow the variable com-&#13;
ponent of bank transaction cost (t), or the deposit interest rate/opportunity&#13;
cost of bank funds (i) to differ between banks. This suggests that the&#13;
general equilibrium contract for a given group of firms, when (e,T,i,t) are&#13;
all allowed to differ across banks, will have the same characteristics as&#13;
those in theorem 1. The only difference is that banks can no longer be ranked&#13;
by a single parameter. They must now be ranked according to their inherent&#13;
competitiveness. This is reflected in the perfectly competitive solution for&#13;
each bank i, that is by the PFi defined earlier.&#13;
Returning to transaction cost differences between banks some of the&#13;
earlier analysis of rural branches of urban based banks may be modified some&#13;
what. We would expect such branches to have at least in early years, a higher&#13;
fixed transaction cost component, and a lower variable cost component or lower&#13;
deposit interest rate. If we ignore 0 differentials we would expect&#13;
relatively larger borrowers to borrow from the organized bank and smaller ones&#13;
to borrow from the traditional money lender. Introduction of 0 differentials&#13;
along the lines of earlier analysis would reinforce the conclusions about&#13;
small farmers, while leaving only large farmers as borrowers from the organ-&#13;
ized banks. Bottomley's (1975) data provides support to this conclusion. A&#13;
parallel argument would apply to formal and informal banks in the urban&#13;
environment, particularly to their lending to small firms. We would therefore&#13;
expect organized banks to lend only to the more modern and larger of the&#13;
informal sector firms, for whom they have relatively lower fixed transaction&#13;
costs and smaller risk differential.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5.5 Macro Implications and Role of Bank Intermediation&#13;
Before concluding this section it is interesting to speculate on some&#13;
of the implications of the micro models of this and the last three sections,&#13;
for macro aspects of the economy. According to Schumpeter financial inter-&#13;
mediation has an important role in the growth and development of the&#13;
economy. He emphasizes the role of technical innovation and the innovating&#13;
entrepreneur. If our hypothesis of the greater 0 differential between lender&#13;
and borrowers for this type of innovative productive activity is true the&#13;
present model provides an explanation. Firstly if available equity is less&#13;
than minimum capital required, and the 0 differential is large, no loan will&#13;
be made, and introduction of the innovation must await accumulation of&#13;
sufficient equity funds. Even if the loan transaction takes place the extent&#13;
of exploitation and the gap between actual and optimal exploitation depends on&#13;
the lending banker. The bank-firm 9 differential for this and other banks&#13;
also determines how much of the profits accrue to the entrepreneur thus pro-&#13;
viding a base for future innovation.&#13;
The present model also provides a micro-economic justification for&#13;
the Gershenkron hypothesis about the role of banking in European industrial-&#13;
ization. According to Gershenkron (1960) British industrialists had generated&#13;
substantial savings from their prior overseas trading activities. These were&#13;
sufficient to meet the minimum capital requirements for the light industry&#13;
which they pioneered. In terms of our analysis, when savers and investors are&#13;
identical, and no intermediation is required, there is no question of any sub-&#13;
jective 0 differential. L4/ In terms of the analysis of section III, when no&#13;
loan is taken, expected marginal product of capital is equated to marginal&#13;
cost of equity. Given a perfect deposit market, this would ensure optimal use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
of resources. Even if short term commercial loans are taken, the risk differ-&#13;
ential, the departures from optimal loan size, and the transfer of resources&#13;
from producers to banks would be relatively small. Gershenkron postulates&#13;
that minimum capital requirements of plants increased with the emergence of&#13;
new intermediate goods industries, into which the continental countries had to&#13;
invest at the start of their industrialization. Given their lower savings-out&#13;
of-profit base, they had to depend on intermediaries for larger and-longer&#13;
term loans. In terms of the analysis of section IV this would have meant a&#13;
greater bank-firm risk differential. Consequently it would have led to lower-&#13;
than - optimal loans and higher loan interest rates, and lower expected&#13;
profits and incentives to invest. In the extreme case it would have meant&#13;
that many investments did not take place at all. According to Gershenkron&#13;
this challenge was met by the introduction of new types of banks. In terms of&#13;
our model these were essentially innovations which reduced the bank-firm risk&#13;
perception (C) differential. -L     One of the most important of these were made&#13;
by the German banks in terms of their intimate and detailed participation in&#13;
borrower firms. -L    As suggested earlier this would generate information&#13;
which would tend to bring about a congruence of expectations and consequently&#13;
an optimal use of resources. In the third stage, constituted by Russian&#13;
industrialization he concludes that the state played a similar role in the&#13;
bank intermediation process. Our earlier analysis in this section suggests&#13;
some of the methods and justification for government organized banks.&#13;
In a traditional static society each persons's investment tends to be&#13;
out of own savings, or at most out of direct borrowing from savers in the same&#13;
community. The role of intermediation is minimal. In a newly industrializing&#13;
economy and in an industrialized one, savings is seldom equal to investment.&#13;
If savers had the same expectations as investors, they could just as well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
participate directly in equity. 17/ Banks play an important role because&#13;
these expectations are not equal. In terms of our model there is a gap&#13;
between the perceptions of savers and of investors. Financial intermediaries&#13;
including the banking system, play a role by reducing (loosely speaking) the&#13;
effective gap between the two. In effect it does this by introducing&#13;
different layers in the form of specialist institutions. These generate&#13;
information, sometimes at less cost as a joint product of other activities,18/&#13;
which bring about a convergence in perceptions between it and the next layer&#13;
of intermediaries or the final investor. This creates markets for loans to&#13;
productive activities which would not have existed otherwise, and improves the&#13;
efficiency of the economy. This would tend to raise savings, investment and&#13;
growth.&#13;

VI. HONEST AND DISHONEST BORROWERS: THE PROBLEM OF MORAL HAZARD AND&#13;
EXISTENCE OF MARKETS&#13;
6.1 The Problem and Its Analysis&#13;
So far we have assumed that all borrowers honestly repay their loans&#13;
according to the mutually accepted repayment schedule (figure 1,section&#13;
2.3). In this section we introduce the possibility of wilful dishonesty. We&#13;
assume that a firm which defaults incurs losses. These could be in the form&#13;
of a loss in future earnings, or psychic losses due to social or moral&#13;
pressure. Formally, we will assume that the firm's expected present value of&#13;
income, apart from any gains or losses in the one period in which the loan is&#13;
used for production activity, is reduced by Z in the event of default. From&#13;
the repayment schedule in figure 1, it is apparent that if there are no&#13;
psychic losses a firm will default if expected repayment L+y-A &gt; C+Z, or y &gt;&#13;
C-L+A+Z.  We could then define honest borrowers as ones whose psychic loss is&#13;
so great that this economic calculus is irrelevant for the loan under&#13;
consideration. Alternatively, we could arbitrarily assign a monetary value to&#13;
the psychic loss, and include it in Z. In this case honest firms are those&#13;
for whom C+Z &gt; (1+r)L.&#13;
Consider a group of firms which are identical in all other relevant&#13;
respects, but consist of honest and dishonest firms. In the present paper we&#13;
will consider the simplest possible case. We assume that there are only two&#13;
types of firms, one having Z=O, and the other Z=-. 1/ If the bank could dis-&#13;
tinguish perfectly between these two sub-groups of firms, we would have two&#13;
separate groups. Reverting to the differential expectation case of&#13;
Chapter IV, the honest borrowers would have a separate market of the type&#13;
analyzed there. Dishonest borrowers repay only the amount C (the collateral&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
value), no matter what their returns are. As before, the interesting analysis&#13;
occurs only when C &lt; (1+r)L, so that we will continue to assume this 2/ In&#13;
this case no loans are made to dishonest firms.&#13;
Now assume that banks given their present knowledge, cannot&#13;
distinguish between honest and dishonest firms. -/ The banks have an&#13;
identical subjective probability p, that any firm from the group is honest.&#13;
Honest firms will pay according to schedule, while dishonest firms will always&#13;
default. The banks' expectation of profits from a loan to any firm in the&#13;
group is the probability weighted average of the repayments by honest and&#13;
dishonest firms:&#13;
PB=p(X-(1+i+t)L-T) + (1-p) (C-1+i+t)-T)&#13;
=pX+(1-p)C-(1+i+t)L-T                                          (17)&#13;
The competitive equilibrium'is easily derived along the lines of that in&#13;
chapter IV by replacing equation (1) by (17). That is we have:&#13;
PXL=1+i+t&#13;
Xi=1+g'                                                          (18)&#13;
pX=(1+i+t)L+(T-(1-p)C)&#13;
Totally differentiating and solving, we show (appendix 5) that, for the con-&#13;
ventional case in Chapter IV,&#13;
L   &gt; O    or &lt; O,  ac &gt;&lt; O,  'pF &gt; F                           (19)&#13;
where the PF refers to profit expectations of an honest firm. If p=l there&#13;
are only honest borrowers and the solution is as before. As p falls below 1,&#13;
the honest firm's expected profits fall, and the loan interest rate rises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
Thus the presence of dishonest borrowers hurts the honest borrowers.       More&#13;
importantly, loan size also falls.    As these results apply even in the&#13;
identical expectations case, the presence of dishonest borrowers is a separate&#13;
and independent cause of inefficiency in the business loan market.&#13;
We know that at p=O there are only dishonest borrowers and the bank&#13;
earns negative profits.   The equilibrium contract is L=O.      The last&#13;
differential of (19) suggests that there is a P=Pmin at which PF will be&#13;
reduced to P . Thus if P &lt; Pmin, the market will cease to exist; the expected&#13;
gain from the loan becomes negative for honest borrowers, and they drop out.&#13;
This can be shown formally, by considering the 'monopoly' solution, given by&#13;
the first two equations of (18) and&#13;
P =L+y+g-A-X' (20)&#13;
Let the equilibrium 'monopoly' contract be (E., r, C).    From our earlier,&#13;
analysis, we know that this yields the highest expected profit to the bank.&#13;
Differentiating and solving the monopoly case (appendix 5) we can show that,&#13;
0,     brop                                                   (21)&#13;
aL &gt; 0,   r&lt; O,    aC&gt; Â°,    a    0-                              (1&#13;
If p=l there are no dishonest borrowers, and this gives the maximum&#13;
possible expected bank profits, which are positive. If p=O, there are only&#13;
dishonest borrowers; any loan yields negative expected profits to the bank.&#13;
Therefore, given the last differential in (21), there must be a 0 &lt; Pmin &lt; 1&#13;
for which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
Thus the banks will not make any loans to this group of firms if the former's&#13;
subjective probability of a firm being honest is less than this Pmin, because&#13;
even under the most favorable terms this would result in negative profits. In&#13;
some ways this is similar to Ackerloff's "Lemons" case. The presence of&#13;
dishonest borrowers drives out the honest by worsening the terms of the loan&#13;
contract, so that the market for loans ceases to exist for this group of&#13;
firms.&#13;
If the 'actual' proportion of honest borrowers in the group is&#13;
greater than pmin' but banks feel that it is less than pmin, no market will&#13;
exist. There is no inherent mechanism here for correcting misperceptions,&#13;
unlike that which exists for repeated loans (discussed in the last section).&#13;
The emergence of a market in this case may have to await either the random&#13;
emergence of a bank with 'Keynesian animal spirits' and optimism, or govern-&#13;
ment intervention.&#13;
In a slightly more general context, when the dishonest borrower is&#13;
characterized by a Z &gt; 0, we can determine whether a market would exist for&#13;
this sub-group if all members could be perfectly identified. We find that&#13;
there is a Zmin such that a market exists for all Z &gt; Zmin, and not for&#13;
Z &lt; Zmin' This suggests that when honest and dishonest borrowers cannot be&#13;
identified the market will continue to exist if Z &gt; Zmin9 but be characterized&#13;
by inefficiencies as shown for Z=O. The degree of inefficiency is likely to&#13;
decrease as Z increases.   When Z &lt; Zmin, we expect to find as for Z=O, a&#13;
Pmin=Pmin(Z) such that no market exists if banks' subjective probability of a&#13;
firms' honesty is less than Pmin(Z)* We expect this minimum probability to be&#13;
a positive function of the expected firm loss Z.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6.2 Implications of the Model&#13;
In Ackerloff's (1970) model of the used car market it is reasonable&#13;
to assume that there is a complete change in the buyers and sellers in the&#13;
market in each period. In the present case it is more reasonable to assume&#13;
that the identity and number of banks remains stable. If the market comes&#13;
into existence, one might expect that eventually all dishonest borrowers will&#13;
be identified and separated from the market for honest borrowers. The extent&#13;
to which this happens and the time it takes depends on many factors,&#13;
however. One is the number of times these firms enter the market or undertake&#13;
repeated loan transactions. We would expect the degree of repetition to be&#13;
relatively high for short term commercial loans, and almost nonexistent for&#13;
very long term loans. At any given time, therefore, the market for longer&#13;
term loans is more likely to be characterized by the problem of dishonest&#13;
borrowers. As discussed earlier differential expectations are also more&#13;
likely in this case so that the degree of inefficiency is higher for long term&#13;
loans.&#13;
Another relevant factor is the information and communication systems&#13;
in the economy as well as those between (actual and potential) banks. In a&#13;
highly developed economy such as the U.S.A. both are likely to be relatively&#13;
sophisticated. This means that dishonest borrowers cannot continue to obtain&#13;
loans on the same terms as honest ones by simply moving to another bank. Once&#13;
their dishonesty is proved, the fact will tend to be rapidly communicated,&#13;
making it impossible for them to borrow from most other banks under 'normal'&#13;
terms. Banks, knowing this, would be relatively willing to take chances with&#13;
familiar borrowers. In a developing country, on the other hand, the&#13;
information systems may be quite elementary; dishonest borrowers may thus be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
able to continue to disguise their true intentions by simply moving to a&#13;
different bank in a different area. In this case, as local bankers are aware&#13;
of this possibility they are likely to be relatively unwilling to take chances&#13;
with new and unknown borrowers. Paradoxically, this problem may not arise in&#13;
a traditional static society where economic mobility is very low. Because&#13;
there are strong economic disincentives to movement, firms are restricted to&#13;
an area where information and communication is perfect. Furthermore the&#13;
social system may be very tightly knit, and social pressures are likely to&#13;
induce high psychic and possibly even economic sanctions against dishonesty.&#13;
Thus, the value of Z may be high enough to make most borrowers honest. A/&#13;
Finally, in the general case when Z &gt; 0, even a dishonest borrower&#13;
does not default if y &lt; C-L+A+Z so that no new information is obtained when y&#13;
is less than C-L+A+Z. Therefore, even when transactions are continually&#13;
repeated and information on defaults is perfect, it will take a random number&#13;
of periods to detect the dishonest firms.&#13;
In the literature on banking, reference has often been made to the&#13;
critical role of the banker's personal judgment of the potential borrower.&#13;
Subjective probabilities are, of course, judgmental but they are based largely&#13;
on economic performance in the activity for which a loan is required. The&#13;
above model suggests that what may be equally if not more important, is a&#13;
judgment of a borrower's desire honestly to repay the loan. In such a judg-&#13;
ment, superficially irrelevant things like a borrower's social standing,&#13;
general prestige, reputation and moral behaviour may become quite relevant.&#13;
The model provides an explanation for a paradoxical factor in the&#13;
rating system used by U.S. banks for personal credit. Other things being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
equal a borrower who has run up a large debt in the past but paid most or all&#13;
of it gets a higher rating than one who has never run up a debt. Further the&#13;
higher the past but now repaid debt the higher the credit rating. In the&#13;
absence of personal judgment of honesty, a past but repaid debt provides a&#13;
measure of the individual's unobservable Z factor and of the probability that&#13;
he is honest. On the other hand, a person who has never been a debtor is an&#13;
unknown quantity as far as his Z factor and the probability that he is honest&#13;
are concerned. These must therefore be deduced from the average for the&#13;
residual group, and have a high degree of uncertainty.&#13;
The model also provides a possible explanation of the observation in&#13;
LDCs, that even when urban based banks open branches in rural areas, their&#13;
lending often remains small in proportion to the deposits collected. Rural&#13;
moneylenders, and others like traders, retailers and landlords to whom money-&#13;
lending is a secondary occupation have an intimate knowledge of the potential&#13;
borrowers in the vicinity. They can therefore make finer distinctions about&#13;
the potential honesty and dishonesty of borrowers, and can lend selectively to&#13;
subgroups of borrowers who may appear as a single unprofitable group to the&#13;
outside bank. If these banks are forced by government to lend to these groups&#13;
at controlled interest rates they are likely to show higher default rates and&#13;
lower profits than the local moneylenders because of the inability to identify&#13;
dishonest borrowers. As suggested earlier, however, there will be a tendency&#13;
for default rates to fall as information accumulates and dishonest borrowers&#13;
can be identified.&#13;
The model also provides an explanation of the much noted linkage&#13;
between credit and other markets in developing countries. 5/ If interlinkage&#13;
of markets raised the borrower's expected income loss Z, it could create a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
loan market where none existed before. Similarly, it could raise the volume&#13;
of loans, and reduce the loan interest rate. Thus -a landlord, by linking&#13;
credit and tenancy can ensure honest repayment of loans. In the same way,&#13;
monopoly retailers or grain merchants in small villages can ensure honesty in&#13;
loan repayment by linking the consumer goods or grain markets with the loan&#13;
market.&#13;
Defaults on loans made by government funded credit co-operatives are&#13;
frequent in many developing countries. Further, it is often observed that&#13;
large farmers have a relatively high default rate. 6 The model suggests that&#13;
the absence of sufficient social and moral pressures, and/or the perceived&#13;
unwillingness of government to use strong measures to recover these debts will&#13;
tend to reduce the expected income loss (Z) to borrowers - thus raising the&#13;
number of dishonest individuals and the total default rate. Moreover, those&#13;
with access to the political power structure which initiates credit programs&#13;
can influence the extent and timing of repayment. These people, mostly the&#13;
large farmers, will tend to have a relatively low Z and relatively high&#13;
default rate, contrary to what we might expect on purely economic grounds. A&#13;
policy of more stringent enforcement for the economically better-off has been&#13;
suggested to correct this situation. Alternatively, governments could&#13;
encourage locally based individuals with surplus funds to become bankers&#13;
through training subsidies or supplies of credit.&#13;
It was noted in Chapter V that urban informal bankers in developing&#13;
countries lend to certain groups of small entrepreneurs because the subjective&#13;
risk differential between them is low. One reason given for this was the&#13;
close socio-economic links between the banks and firms. These same links&#13;
would provide superior information on the potential honesty and dishonesty of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
borrowers, and would thus allow separation of these groups. This would&#13;
enhance loan volume and improve further the loan terms they could offer to&#13;
firms.&#13;
6.3 Research and Development in Banking and the Difference Between Private&#13;
and Social Benefits&#13;
Consider a loan market for a group of firms in which the proportion&#13;
of honest firms is less than Pmin' and the banks' subjective probability of a&#13;
firm's being honest, p &lt; Pmin. In this case, no loans are made to this group&#13;
of firms. Now consider the possibility of an innovation in banking technology&#13;
which would consist of a development of a set of indicators, I; if a firm&#13;
posesses these indicators, the banks' subjective probability of it being&#13;
honest is higher than Pmin' That is, p'= Pr(Honest/I) &gt; Pmin. This&#13;
innovation requires an R &amp; D expenditure of C1, however. These expenditures&#13;
can be thought of in two ways. One is in terms of the discounted value of&#13;
expenditures incurred in gathering information and statistically processing it&#13;
to develop the indicators. Another is in terms of the discounted value of&#13;
expected losses incurred in lending to this group 7/ In the latter case,&#13;
information about the group would accumulate over time through direct contact&#13;
during the lending process which allows finer discrimination between&#13;
firms 8 Presuming that this group repeatedly takes loans, or that the&#13;
information is relevant for other similar groups, this would progressively&#13;
raise Pr (Honest/I') till p'=Pr(Honest/I). For the purposes of formal&#13;
exposition, we ignore inter-temporal processes and assume that a fixed cost C1&#13;
is required to develop I, which raises p to p' &gt; Pmin.&#13;
More precisely, from the initial group of m potential borrowers, it&#13;
allows the bank to separate out n &lt; m firms for which the probability of being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
honest is p'. The question to be answered is whether any bank will undertake&#13;
this activity. Readers familiar with the literature on R&amp;D will note that the&#13;
issue is similar in many respects to the questions addressed by this&#13;
literature. That is, among other things, the answer depends on market struc-&#13;
ture and the appropriability of the invention or development. The most&#13;
noticeable difference between development of this kind of information and&#13;
normal R&amp;D is, that the former is not a patentable product or process, but a&#13;
method and its associated data. The use of the method can give virtually&#13;
costless information on the identified subset of firms, so that the 'imitation&#13;
lag' may be very small. The system also shares some of the characteristics of&#13;
basic scientific research.&#13;
In the present paper we consider the simplest possible model, which&#13;
is plausible given the above characteristics. Consider a competitive loan&#13;
market. The innovating firm can appropriate monopoly profits from the&#13;
identified sub-group for only one time period. In other words, all banks are&#13;
assumed to acquire the relevant methodology costlessly at the end of the first&#13;
period of use of its use. Competitive pressures then reduce expected profits&#13;
from the sub-group to zero in the next period. The optimal quasi-monopoly&#13;
contract for the innovating firm during the first period is given by equations&#13;
(18) with the last equation replaced by (20).    Let this be (L,i,), and the&#13;
associated expected profits PB(E,i,C). The expected return from innovation,&#13;
E(I), is&#13;
E[I] = mPBB(L,r,C)-CI&#13;
=  m[p'X(T,F,G)+(l-p')C-(l+i+t)L-T]-CI                      (22)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
Obviously innovation will occur only if expected returns are&#13;
positive. It is seen from (22) that the larger the size of the market or the&#13;
number of firms (m) in the sub-group the greater the expected return and the&#13;
incentive to innovate. Similarly, the fixed component of bank transaction&#13;
cost for this group is inversely related to the expected gain. Therefore high&#13;
transaction costs (T) for any group of firms will discourage innovation.       In&#13;
the historical development of modern bank intermediation, we would thus expect&#13;
large identifiable groups and those with low transaction costs to be brought&#13;
into the market first. As the information and communication systems develop&#13;
and T falls, more groups would progressively enter the market.&#13;
This provides an additional reason for the smaller amount of modern&#13;
bank lending to heterogeneous groups of small entrepreneurs. We expect the&#13;
fixed component of transaction costs to be higher for this group, so that&#13;
markets for them would appear much later than for large public limited com-&#13;
panies with recognized professional management and public accountability.&#13;
A very interesting result is the effect of the deposit interest rate&#13;
on the incentive to innovate. It is easily shown (see appendix 5) that&#13;
&lt; 0, in both the differential and identical expectation cases.     Lower&#13;
deposit interest rates provide an incentive for banking innovations which&#13;
bring new borrowers into the market and improve the efficiency of the loan&#13;
market. It is not possible, however, to conclude from this that government&#13;
ceilings on interest rates would have the same incentive affect. On the con-&#13;
trary, limitations on the total availability of funds to banks could have the&#13;
opposite effect, by making the given group or subgroup a lower priority&#13;
borrower in bank lending. Note also that banking innovations which expand the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
scope of the business loan market would be expected to accelerate in countries&#13;
in which the deposit interest rate is falling.&#13;
Let us assume that the group of firms defined earlier is small enough&#13;
so that as a first approximation the bank deposit interest rate (i) remains&#13;
unchanged if it enters the market. Assume a perfectly competitive economy.&#13;
The expected social benefit is greater than the expected private benefit&#13;
(equation 22), by the discounted increase in the productivity of the sub-group&#13;
of firms, from next period on. The expected increase in productivity is&#13;
equivalent to the expected quasi-monopoly profits, E[I]+C1, from the next&#13;
period on. These must be positive by definition, as p' &gt; Pmin. Therefore the&#13;
social benefits always exceed the private benefits in this case. We&#13;
hypothesize that this will continue to be true for more complicated models, as&#13;
long as the social discount rate does not exceed the private rate. Thus if&#13;
the private incentive is not strong enough for the loan market to exist, a&#13;
strong a priori case exists for government subsidies to banks, or government&#13;
funding for R&amp;D in developing such indicators of the kind discussed above.&#13;
The actual decision will of course have to weigh. the social benefit against&#13;
the cost C1.&#13;
The devising of an effective policy to accomplish this poses&#13;
problems, however. There is no tradition of formal research in this field, so&#13;
it is difficult to identify the R&amp;D activities which are to be eligible for&#13;
tax deductions. Moreover, the output of the process in the form of informa-&#13;
tion and an evaluative methodology is intangible, so that a lump sum subsidy&#13;
may simply be absorbed by the bank, leaving the direct incentive unchanged.&#13;
The only way to ensure use of a subsidy for the required purpose is to link it&#13;
with a condition that the bank must make a certain volume of loans available&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
to the identified group. This would be particularly useful if, as suggested&#13;
earlier, the innovation process is linked to the generation and analysis of&#13;
information through actual loan transactions to the group (CI is the expected&#13;
loss during this period). !/ Forced allocation of credit for a limited period&#13;
of time may therefore be an essential ingredient of a successful policy of in-&#13;
novation in the banking field. In the context of economic development policy&#13;
government funding of efforts to collect, collate and disseminate banking&#13;
innovations in this area is the other essential ingredient.&#13;

VII. LACK OF INFORMATION AND ADVERSE SELECTION&#13;
7.1 Outline of the Problem&#13;
In this chapter we consider a very simple model of adverse&#13;
selection. It is'assumed that there is a group of firms consisting of two&#13;
types of firms. 1/ Firms in these two sub-groups differ only in the degree of&#13;
pessimism attached to the returns from the productive activity for which the&#13;
loan is desired; otherwise they are identical. One sub-group has pessimism&#13;
parameter 91 and the other has pessimism parameter 92. The bank knows that&#13;
these two sub-groups exist, but given its present information, cannot&#13;
determine which sub-group any firm from the group belongs to. It has a&#13;
subjective probability p of any firm belonging to the less risky group&#13;
1(9s). This type of situation is most likely to occur for bank loans to new&#13;
entrepreneurs and possibly also for existing entrepreneurs expanding into new&#13;
and unrelated activities. In general this type of situation is more likely&#13;
for longer term loans than for shorter term ones.&#13;
From the firms' perspective there are two possibilities. One is that&#13;
the firms themselves do not know their correct e parameter, but only that it&#13;
is one of the two mentioned earlier. This case does not really involve&#13;
adverse selection, and will not be considered further. The other case is one&#13;
in which the firms know which of the two sub-groups they belong to. However,&#13;
the firms in sub-group 2 with lower productivity or expected returns&#13;
(higher 0), act in their loan requests as if they had the same 0 parameter as&#13;
the other group. As will be apparent, if they did not do this they could be&#13;
easily distinguished, because for each (r,C) value they would have a higher&#13;
demand for loans than sub-group 1. This is easily seen by recalling from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
earlier analysis that an increase in 0 shifts the firm's loan demand curve to&#13;
the right in (L,r) space for each C.&#13;
The expected return to the bank from making a loan to any member of&#13;
the group is a probability weighted average of the expected profits from a&#13;
less and more productive firm, and is given by the following equation;&#13;
PB = pX1 + (1-p)X2 - (l+i+t)L - T     X - (l+i+t)L - T            (23)&#13;
where&#13;
i = (1+r)L fb(y)dy + f (L+y+g-A)f(y)dy + cf     f(y)dy&#13;
1(y)=Pf(y,Oc) + (1-p)f(y,02) 21 and X1 and X2 represent the expected repayment&#13;
from firms belonging to sub-groups 1 and 2 respectively.      X in (23)&#13;
constitutes the expected repayment from a member of the undifferentiable&#13;
group, and is a probability weighted average of X1 and X2. 3/&#13;
Given the earlier definition of 0, it is easily shown that -(y) has a&#13;
lower mean than f(y,01), and a higher mean than f(y,02). Recalling the&#13;
analysis of the identical expectations case in chapter III, 4/ this means that&#13;
the loan supply (LB) curve for the undifferentiable group is an average of the&#13;
hypothetical supply curves for the two sub-groups (i.e. LBHI and LBH2) and&#13;
must lie between these hypothetical supply curves (see figure 14). Therefore&#13;
the loan size for the less risky group would be lower and the interest rate&#13;
would be higher than it would be if the less productive group could be&#13;
identified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

7.2 The Formal Analysis&#13;
More formally, we assume that the banks' and firms' subjective&#13;
pessimism parameters are identical. That is, the banks have the same&#13;
subjective                       Figure 14&#13;

parameter 49i for sub-group i (i=1,2) as the sub-group itself has. The&#13;
competitive equilibrium solution is given by the following equation;&#13;
XL = PXlL + (1-P)X2L = l+i+t&#13;
XlL =l+g'                                                         (24)&#13;
x_PX1 +'(1-P)X2 =(1+i+t)L + T&#13;
The first equation of (24) can be simplified, on substitution of the second&#13;
equation of (24) to,&#13;
X2= 1 +     i+t-pg'                                               (25)&#13;
1-P ~ ~ ~  ~   ~~      &#13;
Note that if we put 92=91, (24) reduces to the hypothetical identical&#13;
expectations equilibrium solution for sub-group 1. Similarly if we put 91=92&#13;
(and relabel XIL as X20), it reduces to the identical expectations equilibrium&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
for sub-group 2.    Differentiating (24) and (25) totally and solving (appendix&#13;
5), we obtain two cases: which are very similar to the Conventional and&#13;
Unconventional cases of Section IV. We have a conventional case when&#13;
-H 2         FH2= L&#13;
Here LFH2=LBH2 and LFH1=LBH1. As before, it is not possible to prove&#13;
formally, but we speculate that the conventional case is more likely&#13;
for     &lt;   ,in which case we also hv          r&gt;           -b              We will&#13;

I FH 1=l-F     IFH2 =-F&#13;
assume therefore that conventional case applies.&#13;
For the conventional case we therefore have (appendix 5) 5/&#13;

The set of equations (24) and (25) reduce to the hypothetical sub-&#13;
group 1 solution for p=1. Therefore the first two differentials of (26) show&#13;
that for p &lt; 1, the loan size must be lower and the interest rate higher for&#13;
this more productive subgroup than if the sub-groups were perfectly&#13;
separable. Non-separability therefore reduces loan size below the optimal&#13;
level, giving rise to inefficiency. Further, the higher the proportion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
sub-group 2 firms in the group, the greater the degree of inefficiency.    In&#13;
terms of figure 14, a lowering of p shifts the supply curve for the&#13;
undifferential group (LB) to the right, decreasing loan size. As in the moral&#13;
hazard case, therefore, this is an independent source of market&#13;
inefficiency. There is a qualification here, however. We have implicitly&#13;
assumed that it is more profitable for sub-group 2 firms to conceal their true&#13;
demand curves and act as if their pessimism parameter is     * That is, PF2 &gt;&#13;
PFH2; the second last differential in (26) suggests that this may not be so&#13;
for all values of p. At p=O the .group consists entirely of firms with&#13;
parameter 02. From the last differential of (26), the initial introduction of&#13;
firms with parameter 01 will raise the profits of the sub-group 2 firms with&#13;
parameter 02. This may not remain true for all higher values of p, however,&#13;
as the gain from better terms may be offset by the loss from reduction in loan&#13;
size. A sufficient condition for concealment to remain profitable (i.e. PF2 &gt;&#13;
PFH2) is for 6PF2/aP &gt; O in (26).&#13;
Assume that PF2 &gt; PFH2 and therefore the solution is given by (24)&#13;
and (25). From (28), for any given proportion of the two sub-groups in the&#13;
given group, sub-group l's profits and loan size fall and interest rates rise&#13;
with 02, the sub-group 2 pessimism factor, [see figure 15(a)]. This effect is&#13;
somewhat similar to the effect of an increase in the bank's subjective&#13;
pessimism factor e in the differential expectations case.    Here the effective&#13;
or average   0 can be  conceived as lying between   01 and  0 2.  In both cases&#13;
the firm's (here group 1 firm's) factor has not changed so that the gap&#13;
between the effective pessimism factor of the bank and that of the firm group&#13;
grows, leaving the firm worse off.   On the other hand, when 01 changes there&#13;
are two effects(see'figure 15(b)). One is a change in the gap between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
01 and 02$ and consequently the bank's effective 0, so that an increase&#13;
in 01 would reduce the bank-subgroup gap and tend to raise expected profits&#13;
and loan size. In addition, the rise in 01 also shifts the sub-group 1 demand&#13;
curve to the right (relative to the supply curve) tending to reduce loan&#13;
size. 6/   The total effect on loan size is therefore uncertain.     The loan&#13;
interest rate rises, however.&#13;

7.3 Non-lending to Certain Categories of Firms&#13;
Sub-group 1 firms' expected profits are positively related to the&#13;
proportion of such firms (p) in the undifferentiable group [see (26)]. This&#13;
suggests that as this proportion decreases a point may be reached at which&#13;
their expected profits are just equal to what they would make without taking&#13;
any loan. More careful consideration suggests that this can only happen under&#13;
certain conditions. First consider a situation in which a loan market for&#13;
both sub-groups exists under hypothetical conditions in which firms could be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
assigned with certainty to one or the other group. This implies that under&#13;
competitive conditions each sub-group would have had the identical&#13;
expectations equilibrium outlined in chapter III, with PFH1 &gt; SFH1 and PFH2 &gt;&#13;
PFH2. In this case we would generally not expect that a mere change in the&#13;
proportion of each type of firm in the undifferentiable group would result in&#13;
subgroup 1 firms' expected profits falling below PF.     This possibility cannot&#13;
be ruled out, however, because the lower the proportion of subgroup 1 firms,&#13;
the lower the loan size for both types of firms. This means that the expected&#13;
returns to productive activity fall for all firms taken together.&#13;
Consequently, the pool of resources to be divided between loan repayment and&#13;
firm profits becomes progressively smaller. Given the fixed element of bank&#13;
transaction cost T, and firm transaction cost A, this surplus could possibly&#13;
be reduced below the sum of these two surpluses in the hypothetical case.&#13;
Next consider the more clear cut case in which, if the firms could be&#13;
assigned to one sub-group with certainty, no loan would be made to the less&#13;
productive subgroup 2 firms (i.e. PFH2 &lt; PFH2).     In this case, considering the&#13;
undifferentiable group, we know that if the proportion of more productive&#13;
firms is one (p=l) the market exists and these firms have a net gain from the&#13;
loan transaction. Similarly, we know that when there are only non-productive&#13;
firms (p=O) no loan is made. Finally, from the above analysis we know that&#13;
the expected profits of subgroup 1 firms fall progressively if p decreases&#13;
from 1 to 0. We therefore expect that there is a value of p, say Pmin, at&#13;
which group 1's expected profits are equal to PF, and below which this group&#13;
of firms will drop out completely (because loan terms become so adverse as to&#13;
result in net loss from borrowing). If this is so, then for all p below Pmin&#13;
the loan market for the whole group would collapse, as the exit of type 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
firms would leave only type 2 firms i.e. p goes from Pmin to zero, and these&#13;
firms would not on their own receive any loans at all. This process, in the&#13;
more general context of n indistinguishable sub-groups of firms,. is called&#13;
adverse selection. In this more general context it denotes a process by which&#13;
more stringent loan terms result in the exit of the best customers in the&#13;
market, resulting in still worsening terms for the remaining firms and&#13;
possibly still further exits.&#13;
If banks feel that the proportion of more productive firms is less&#13;
than Pmin, no market will exist even if the proportion is in fact greater.&#13;
The rest of the analysis is exactly analogous to that in the previous chapter&#13;
(see section 6.3). A case can therefore be made for government subsidies for&#13;
R&amp;D in this case also.&#13;
The situation in which agricultural or other households borrow for&#13;
productive purposes, but surreptitiously divert some of the loan to&#13;
consumption purposes is easily framed as a problem of adverse selection. For&#13;
any given loan size L, total capital used in production k, is equal to equity&#13;
plus loan size minus the amount diverted for consumption (M) (K = E+L-M).&#13;
Consider two types of households one of which diverts an amount M1 to&#13;
consumption and the other diveerts M2. This is equivalent to saying that the&#13;
firms equity contribution for the first sub-group is El = E-M1 and for the&#13;
second sub-group is E2 = E-M2 as K1 = E1+L and K2 = E2+L. Assume now that&#13;
these sub-groups are identical in all other relevant characteristics. As&#13;
before, for any firm in the group, the bank cannot distinguish whether it&#13;
belongs to sub-group 1 or sub-group 2, although it has a subjective judgment&#13;
of the proportion of each type of firm in the group. We would get a figure&#13;
very similar to figure 14, that is,&#13;

and the analysis would go through exactly as before.&#13;
7.4 Absence of Long Term Loans and Other Implications&#13;
Some of the implications of this model were outlined in section 1.4&#13;
of the Introduction. One of the most important is the problem of long term&#13;
loans. It was explained there how adverse selection (and, to a lesser extent,&#13;
moral hazard) provides a major part of the explanation of why long term loans&#13;
to more productive investors may be of less than optimal size and at higher&#13;
than optimal interest rates. Adverse selection is probably the most&#13;
significant explanation of the small numbers of loans, both medium and long&#13;
term, to firms entering new and (to the bank) unfamiliar lines of activity&#13;
(new products, new exports etc.). In the absence of historical information on&#13;
the new activity, it is very difficult for the firm to judge its productivity.&#13;
By definition, the initiator of the activity must have acquired information&#13;
and knowledge about this activity and be quite optimistic about this activity,&#13;
otherwise he would not go in for it. From the prospective of the banks,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
however, some new activities may be productive while others are less so, and&#13;
the particular group to which any given one belongs is uncertain. This tends&#13;
to result in less than optimal loans for the more productive new activities.&#13;
In some cases no loans may be made at all. A similar situation arises with&#13;
new entrepreneurs and firms, but the moral hazard problem is equally important&#13;
in this case.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER WORK&#13;
8.1 Overview&#13;
The paper defines efficiency in the business loan market in terms of&#13;
the equality between the expected marginal product of the loan and the&#13;
marginal cost of obtaining and transferring funds from bank depositors to bank&#13;
borrowers. The importance of this definition is that it is independent of the&#13;
degree of uncertainty in the returns from the productive activity for which&#13;
the loan is desired, as long as banks and firms have identical perceptions&#13;
about this uncertainty. In this case, efficiency is not affected by an&#13;
increase in bank oligopoly or monopoly powers where such power is precisely&#13;
and quantifiably defined by the model itself.     It is also shown that effi-&#13;
ciency in the loan market ensures efficiency in the equity decision if the&#13;
loan and equity decisions are interlinked to take account of the effect of the&#13;
latter on the contract terms of the former. There is underinvestment in&#13;
equity, however, if this link is not made and the two decisions are made&#13;
independently.&#13;
By contrast, questions of the distribution of gains between borrower&#13;
firms and lender banks are intimately related to the difference between the&#13;
"true" productivity   and the identical (by assumption) perceptions of the bank&#13;
and firm. If the degree of perceived productivity is less than the "true"&#13;
productivity, the bank benefits at the cost of the firm. Similarly, if the&#13;
perceived productivity is greater than the actual or true productivity, the&#13;
firm benefits at the cost of the bank. Therefore on an average banks would&#13;
benefit from the principle of conservative judgment which is generally&#13;
attributed to them, if they can convince firms to be equally conservative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
Even if the firms do not have the same conservative judgment, banks still gain&#13;
relative to firms, if on average the firms' expectations are 'true' and those&#13;
of the banks are pessimistic relative to the 'true' productivity. These&#13;
distributional considerations can have important effects if saving and&#13;
investment propensities of the bankers and owners of firms differ, but this&#13;
question lies outside the scope of the present paper. One can speculate,&#13;
however, that the remarkable growth of manufactured exports from Korea is at&#13;
least partly due to the replacement of bank conservatism by optimism with&#13;
respect to manufacturer - exporters under the direction of the government.&#13;
The paper also shows that the degree of bank monopoly with respect to any&#13;
group of borrowers (e.g. moneylenders and rural borrowers) also directly&#13;
affects distributional equity. The greater the degree of monopoly, the&#13;
greater the benefit to the bank at the cost of the firm. These distributional&#13;
effects could have an effect on savings, investment and growth.&#13;
The paper identifies three major causes of inefficiency in the loan&#13;
market. The first relates to bank-firm differences in the perception of&#13;
uncertainty with regard to productive returns. The second relates to moral&#13;
hazards, or the inability of the bank to separate honest from dishonest&#13;
borrowers. The third relates to adverse selection, or the inability of banks&#13;
to distinguish between firms with greater and smaller mean returns. In all&#13;
three situations, the extreme case of inefficiency is represented by the&#13;
disppearance of the loan market for the group or sub-group of firms. In the&#13;
first case, that of differential expectations, it is shown that under certain&#13;
conditions the degree of 'monopoly' is directly related to the degree of&#13;
inefficiency. There is also a possible but less likely case in which&#13;
'monopoly' actually reduces the degree of inefficiency.     In either case,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
however, certain government policies involving, e.g., lump sum subsidies,&#13;
interest subsidies, collateral subsidies and forced lending can remove this&#13;
inefficiency. The paper also shows that there are certain differences between&#13;
the 'monopoly' and competitive situations in the relationship between loan&#13;
interest rate and collateral; these can be used to test the model. The paper&#13;
also analyzes the situation in which lack of acceptable collateral can lead to&#13;
inefficiency, and excessive transaction costs can lead to the disappearance&#13;
of the loan market.&#13;
In the moral hazard and adverse selection cases, we defined a process&#13;
of research and development in banking as the development of indicators to&#13;
separate honest from dishonest borrowers. It was shown that the returns to&#13;
private research may be significantly lower than the social returns in many&#13;
cases. A strong case can therefore be made for government subsidies to&#13;
research in this area.   It was also shown that this may require linking such&#13;
subsidies with forced lending to particular groups where the problem of moral&#13;
hazard or adverse selection is acute.     Similar support may also be useful in&#13;
separating firms with different degrees of uncertainty in returns.&#13;
The general model, termed competitive monopoly, is only briefly&#13;
analyzed but has some interesting implications. It helps explain why&#13;
accusations of monopoly profits by rural moneylenders in a less developed&#13;
country may have some validity even when there are many such moneylenders in&#13;
different villages in the same area.    It also explains why the introduction of&#13;
an organized urban bank into such an area may have no effect on the rural&#13;
credit market. Where informal credit markets exist in developing countries,&#13;
the model suggests conditions under which (and types of bankers for whom) it&#13;
would be socially optimal to encourage them. This result contradicts to some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
extent the usual belief of governments that such markets must be restricted or&#13;
controlled.&#13;
8.2 Changes in Degree of Uncertainty&#13;
There are certain issues which have not been addressed in the paper&#13;
and certain simplifying assumptions which may need to be relaxed in future&#13;
work. These will be considered briefly. Throughout the paper, changes in&#13;
expectations were analyzed in terms of the pessimism factor, an increase in&#13;
which implies an expectation of lower mean returns from productive activity.&#13;
Another way in which expectational changes can be analyzed is in terms of the&#13;
riskiness or spread of the distribution of the returns. These are referred to&#13;
in the literature as mean preserving spreads. The analysis of changes in&#13;
riskiness is more complicated, because in addition to all the cases analyzed&#13;
it is also possible to get the opposite case.     Thus for example, increased&#13;
differences in perception of risk between banks and firms can decrease&#13;
efficiency, as in the case of increases in the pessimism differential, but may&#13;
also increase efficiency (depending on various functional forms and exogenous&#13;
parameter values). Another major difference (which in effect follows from the&#13;
above) is that, given the risk neutrality assumption throughout the paper,&#13;
differences in risk perception, no matter how large, are unlikely to result in&#13;
disappearance of the loan markets for the given firms. l/ There is still no&#13;
rationing, however. This result is different from Stiglitz and Weiss (1981),&#13;
who assume exogenously given collateral, equity, capital requirements (and&#13;
consequently also loan size) and non-negative returns to the productive&#13;
activity, and then show that rationing is possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
8.3 Non-perfect Market on the Deposit Side&#13;
It is assumed in the paper that the bank can obtain unlimited funds&#13;
at the deposit interest rate i. In most countries there are government&#13;
imposed ceilings on this rate, which is usually fixed by the government.&#13;
Consider the case in which this exogenous rate acts as a constraint on total&#13;
savings.   If we assume that total savings at this rate are exogenously divided&#13;
up among the banks, as for example by free depositor choice, all the results&#13;
of the model go through unchanged. All that happens is that the deposit rate&#13;
i is replaced by a shadow cost of funds, say x , in the bank's loan&#13;
decisions. The banks now earn monopoly profits on the deposit side equal to&#13;
the difference between   X and i multiplied by their total deposits.     Loan&#13;
decisions, though now based on X, have the same qualitative feature as those&#13;
analyzed in the paper.&#13;
8.4 Risk Aversion on the Part of Borrowers or Lenders&#13;
The paper assumes risk neutrality by firms and banks. In traditional&#13;
theory, if equity markets exist this is shown to be a reasonable approximation&#13;
for all firms. In most LDCs, however, such markets do not exist and both firm&#13;
equity and loan demand may be affected by degree of risk aversion. I would&#13;
hypothesize that, apart from complicating the derivation of the loan demand&#13;
curve, this would not make any essential difference to the qualitative&#13;
analysis. -/ The problem is less important in the case of banks if they can&#13;
pool their risk across different firms. This is possible if the returns of&#13;
different firms are not highly correlated and if each loan is a small&#13;
proportion of the total loans outstanding.     In the case of traditional&#13;
agriculture, however, the returns of different borrowers may be highly&#13;
correlated. This would require incorporation of bank risk aversion. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
model can be extended to include a tradeoff between the banks' expected&#13;
profits and the variance in these profits.    If firms, are risk neutral,&#13;
preliminary analysis suggests that the loan size would be lower and the&#13;
interest rate and collateral higher if banks are risk averse than if they are&#13;
risk neutral.&#13;
8.5 Multiperiod Loans&#13;
Finally it would be possible to consider the question of loan terms&#13;
and the choice between short and long term loans, if the model were extended&#13;
to a multiperiod framework. The structure of the model is quite suitable for&#13;
this extension.&#13;
8.6 Implications for Entrepreneurial Savings&#13;
The model has implications for equity contributions and&#13;
entreprenurial savings which are not touched on in the paper. Consider a&#13;
situation in which equity markets are highly imperfect or non-existent.&#13;
Assume that the marginal cost of equity or entrepreneurial saving is non-&#13;
decreasing with equity. Now suppose that government puts a ceiling on loan&#13;
interest rates which is an effective ceiling for certain borrowers who would&#13;
otherwise be charged higher rates. For a given level of equity the analysis&#13;
of chapter IV shows tht collateral rises and loan amounts fall. The latter&#13;
would in turn imply a rise in the marginal product of the loan plus equity&#13;
above the marginal cost of equity. Equilibrium would require an increase in&#13;
equity contribution and consequently in entrepreneurial savings. Similar&#13;
results follow if ceilings are put on deposit interest rates. This means that&#13;
a ceiling on interest rates may raise savings instead of reducing them, as&#13;
traditionally assumed.&#13;

Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) where rationing results from Adverse&#13;
Selection. Rationing is defined as the willingness of the borrower to&#13;
pay a higher interest rate than that prevailing in the market, to obtain&#13;
a larger loan than he is getting.&#13;
17/ We will show that when this is taken into account there will in general&#13;
be no rationing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
18/ They show that no rationing exists in this case. See also Barro (1976).&#13;
19/ The peculiar nature of this market is explained in the section below.&#13;
20/ Obviously the demand for deposits in the first market is not independent&#13;
of the supply of loans in the second. But this situation is quite common&#13;
in production theory where the firm's derived demand for inputs depends&#13;
on conditions in the output market.&#13;
21/ If goods are sold at credit, by definition a credit transaction is taking&#13;
place at the same time as a goods transaction. Similarly a futures&#13;
market for a good involves a commitment to a simultanenous exchange at a&#13;
future date, at a prespecified price.&#13;
22/ In many ways this is the inverse of the insurance market. Those familiar&#13;
with insurance markets will recognize, as we proceed, many similarities&#13;
between the two. The flow of services associated with purchase of&#13;
consumer durables also have some features and problems common with those&#13;
in the credit market and have been addressed in the literature on quality&#13;
of consumer durables.&#13;
23/ From the perspective of general equilibrium theory if there were complete&#13;
futures and contingent markets credit would essentially be like any other&#13;
good. Our analysis starts from the practical situation were such markets&#13;
do not exist and where there is no such equilibrium.&#13;
24/ Identical in sense to be made precise later.&#13;
25/ In the literature on joint products and two part tariffs there is some&#13;
discussion of this issue with respect to goods sale. However this issue&#13;
is a peripheral one in the general neoclassical model.&#13;
26/ We are assuming that C is the net value, after subtracting any&#13;
transaction costs, that the firm could obtain with certainty at the end&#13;
of the period of the loan. Alternatively we could assume that there is a&#13;
perfect neo-classical market for the asset that constitutes the&#13;
collateral, and that collateral actually involves a transfer of title to&#13;
the bank at the time the loan is made.&#13;
27/ If C is itself uncertain there are certain complications. This aspect is&#13;
not considered in the present paper. See however Barro (1976).&#13;
28/ As we will show it also shifts the demand curve.&#13;
29/ Nor is the traditional one for a monopsony.&#13;
30/ A more formal analysis is presented in chapter III.&#13;
31/ This is considered formally in chapter IV. An analogy with the Fisherian&#13;
analysis of the real and nominal rates of interest may help some readers&#13;
in understanding the implications of this analysis.     In this analysis the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
nominal rate of interest is equal to the real rate of interest plus the&#13;
rate of inflation.   No matter what the rate of inflation the real amount&#13;
of Savings and Investment are not affected.    Further, as long as both&#13;
savers and investors have the same expectations of inflation for the&#13;
current period the Savings and Investment remain at this 'Pareto-Optimal'&#13;
level for the period under consideration, no matter what the true rate of&#13;
inflation turns out to be. If the true inflation is greater than&#13;
anticipated the savers suffer relative to the investor/borrowers and&#13;
vice-versa. This is exactly analogous to what happens in our Identical&#13;
expectations case. Further when savers and investors/borrowers have&#13;
different expectations say the savers are more pessimistic about&#13;
inflation the savings curve moves to the left relative to the identical&#13;
expectations case resulting in lower than optimal savings and&#13;
investment. This situation is again analogous to our Differential&#13;
expectations case.&#13;
32/ Recall that the expected value is calculated as follows: If there are&#13;
three possibilities, repayment of V1 with probability p1, V2 with&#13;
probability P2 and V3 with probability p3 where Pl+p2+p3 = 1 than the&#13;
expected value of repayment is p1Vl+p2V2+p3V3.&#13;
33/ Here r is on the vertical and L on the horizontal axis. Collateral must&#13;
also adjust to restore competitive equilibrium. This means that both&#13;
curves undergo further shifts before equilibrium is established at higher&#13;
r and lower. L.&#13;
34/ As bank 1 makes the loan there is in general no presumption that bank 2&#13;
or any of the others will receive new information which will make their&#13;
estimates converge to those of bank 1. However such convergence is&#13;
possible, and we would expect it to occur more frequently in developed&#13;
market economies than in informationally fragmented LDCs.&#13;
35/ To my knowledge this is the first time that the credit market, or any&#13;
market has been conceived off in this way.&#13;
36/ In fact two non-colluding banks with identical judgments/expectations is&#13;
sufficient for this solution to reduce to the competitive equilibrium&#13;
defined earlier.&#13;
37/ Though the model is quite general its primary focus is on conditions in&#13;
less developed countries, and the entire chapter has this focus.&#13;
38/ See Campbell and Kracaw (1980) for a treatment of information generation&#13;
as a joint product of other activities. See also Long (1980) for a&#13;
similar suggestion. See Posner (1980) for the role of kin and caste&#13;
groups in pre-modern societies.&#13;
39/ It probably has an equally important role in the dissemination and&#13;
adoption of technical innovations, and in insurance markets.&#13;

40/ This particular problem does not have a major role in the insurance&#13;
market context. See Chapter VI for the analysis.&#13;
41/ Strictly, the subjective distributions are identical.&#13;
42/  Actually only the two most optimistic banks' judgments have to be the&#13;
same. Note that total transaction cost of making a loan for amount L is&#13;
T+tL where T and t are constants. Transaction cost includes returns to&#13;
all factors employed in the bank.&#13;
43/ They are not however simple substitutes, as the discussion of the&#13;
equilibrating role of collateral in section 1.2 has indicated.&#13;
44/ Risk neutrality on the part of both firm and bank is assumed.&#13;
45/ For example in a stock market boom, or in a lending spree proceding a&#13;
spate of bank bankruptcies.&#13;
46/  For example in conditions we associate with the term, 'lack of&#13;
entrepreneurship.'&#13;
47/ This also gives some support to McKinnon's view that higher savings rates&#13;
would allow large enough total savings so that the equity contribution&#13;
can be raised above K.&#13;
48/ Using the term in its popular sense.&#13;
49/ Using the term in its popular sense.&#13;
50/ Other factors which are not addressed here must also be considered for&#13;
such loans. Basically risk aversion and portfolio diversification&#13;
considerations are important because of the large size of loans relative&#13;
to total loans by a bank, and the correlation between different&#13;
countries' repayment problems.&#13;
51/ In this case, bank 2 is probably the local moneylender from the village&#13;
in which the weavers work and live.&#13;
52/ See Thingalaya (1978) for the experience of the Syndicate Bank in India&#13;
along these lines.&#13;

India.&#13;

57/ This model is directly applicable to the case of an agricultural&#13;
household which takes a loan ostensibly for productive purposes and then&#13;
uses part of it for consumption. This problem is equivalent to one in&#13;
which the borrower tries to pass himself off as having greater equity&#13;
participation in a productive activity than he actually has. This can be&#13;
treated in the same way as the productivity problem.&#13;
58/ There is no rationing of borrowers, however, unlike the case in Stiglitz-&#13;
Weiss (1981) where adverse selection can lead to rationing.&#13;

dues exceed this value. There is an element of moral hazard in this&#13;
which is not considered in this section. Stiglitz-Weiss (1981) are an&#13;
exception. Their repayment function depends on gross returns to the&#13;
firm, which are assumed to be non-negative.&#13;
10/  This formulation is well suited for extension to the multi-period case.&#13;
11/  As there is no moral hazard, the firm honestly tries to repay as much as&#13;
feasible. Clearly alternative repayment schedules are possible. The&#13;
simplest one is used here.&#13;

1/   Formally it does not matter if both differ from some 'true' or objective&#13;
distribution. More on this below.&#13;
2/   For the last equation to be satisfied, 5 &lt;     y+g-A-L -T.  Throughout the&#13;
paper we will assume that this type of condition holds, with L replaced&#13;
in general by L. It can easily be shown that this solution is identical&#13;
to the more traditional monopoly solution given by; maximize PB subject&#13;
to XL = 1 + i + t and PF &gt; 3F&#13;
3/   With qualifications about the existence of the market to be made below.&#13;
4/   There can be situations, however, in which A can be substituted for T,&#13;
and banks force firms to incur additional costs so as to reduce their&#13;
own. Thus the requirement by banks that applications for long term loans&#13;
be accompanied by project feasibility reports can be seen in this&#13;
light. On the other hand this example may be showing the peculiar effect&#13;
of interest rate ceilings and government imposed lending requirements&#13;
which force banks to keep T as low as possible.&#13;
5/   Reserve requirements are considered further below.&#13;
6/   Normal profit or return on bank capital is assumed to be included in the&#13;
bank's transaction costs.&#13;

8/   See Baltensperger (1978), Azzi and Cox (1976).&#13;
9/   See Barro (1976).&#13;
10/  Recall that the loan interest rate r, is on the x-axis.&#13;
11/  In both cases we have   y + g(L +E-K) - A - T - (i+t)L   &lt; PF&#13;
12/  The marginal condition g' = i+t would still be satisfied, however.&#13;
13/  The opportunity cost of E is assumed given by the function h(E).     The&#13;
second order condition is g"-h" &lt; 0, which is ensured if h" &gt; 0.&#13;
14/  Imperfections could be due to information constraints or the more usual&#13;
oligopoly-monopoly conditions.&#13;
15/  Identical expectations are not a necessary or sufficient condition for&#13;
this case to arise, or for the results it leads to. The same thing can&#13;
happen in the non-identical expectations case. It is considered here,&#13;
however, as it is empirically more likely to be associated with this&#13;
case.&#13;

17/  In the sense defined here, as the guaranteed repayment.     Many banks,&#13;
formal or informal, take lien on accounts receivable. In many cases&#13;
these are so easily disposable that it is doubtful whether they can be&#13;
included in the C considered here.&#13;

1/   The often noted 'natural conservatism of bankers' suggests that this is&#13;
the most relevant case in practice.    Also see the discussion in section&#13;
3.4 (Chapter III) on the relative gains to the bank and the firm.&#13;
2/   If these are the major reasons, the present section implicitly assumes&#13;
that the expected costs of information are greater than the expected&#13;
returns from the information at the margin.     Further, they remain so for&#13;
exogenous changes considered in the analysis. This is likely if costs&#13;
are incurred in discrete amounts.&#13;
3/   For a discussion of information in the related context of financial&#13;
intermediation see Campbell (1976), Leeland and Pyle (1977), Cambell and&#13;
Kracow (1980) and Benston and Smith (1979).&#13;
4/   This is the contract curve if banks act as price takers, independent of&#13;
the number of banks in the market; i.e. even a single (monopoly) bank is&#13;
assumed to act as a price taker.&#13;
5/   It is hypothesized however that this case is empirically more likely to&#13;
occur with identical expectations than if the differential is&#13;
significantly large.&#13;
6/   A Pseudo-monopolist is defined as a bank which acts as a price despite&#13;
the fact that taker it is the only bank.     Implicit in this unrealistic&#13;
analytic construct is a Walrasian arbitrator who announces contract terms&#13;
to whom the monopolist must give a supply response. The usefulness of&#13;
this construct is that it vastly simplifies the exposition. It also&#13;
forms the basis for the definition of competitive monopoly in the next&#13;
section. The actual monopoly solution is as follows: Maximize P&#13;
subject to XL = 1 + i + t and PF &gt; PE. This solution yields a loan size&#13;
which is smaller than, and an interest rate which is greater than, the&#13;
corresponding pseudo-monopoly solution. In the identical expectations&#13;
case, however, the monopoly and pseudo-monopoly solutions are identical.&#13;
7/   Both figures are drawn on the assumption that bank parameter      e &gt; 0 ' the&#13;
firm's parameter. A hybrid case with L reaching a maximum at some C, C &lt;&#13;
C &lt; C is also possible. But the analysis of the slopes of L = L in&#13;
figures 8(a) or 8(b) below suggests that for some L, the curves must&#13;
intersect at more than one point. This may involve multiple equilibria&#13;
which are not considered in the present paper.&#13;
8/   A not entirely convincing explanation is as follows:      In the conventional&#13;
case the marginal worth of collateral in terms of interest is greater to&#13;
the bank than the firm, which we might intuitively expect when the bank's&#13;
subjective mean is greater than the firm's.&#13;
9/   In this case the degree of inefficiency is again positively related to&#13;
the degree of monopoly. The pessimistic perception of the bank or banks&#13;
leads to a greater than optimal loan size even at the competitive&#13;
level. This is aggravated further under monopoly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
10/ If the speculation/hypothesis presented above is true, this unusual case&#13;
may not arise.&#13;
11/  For existence of equilibrium,    y - g (L +E-k) - A - T - (i+t)L    &gt; 0.&#13;
12/ In figure 9(c) demand is positive for higher loan interest rates, and a&#13;
given collateral level. Demand would be reduced to zero at a collateral&#13;
level high enough to elicit positive supply.&#13;
13/ This relates to the question of the communicability and interpretation of&#13;
information which was touched on in section 1.3 of the Introduction.&#13;
14/ In "open" LDC economies, a similar problem might be expected with regard&#13;
to lending by international banks to local as opposed to multionational&#13;
companies.&#13;
15/ An added complication is adverse selection, which is considered in&#13;
Chapter VII.&#13;
16/ Some of these problems have been overcome in developing countries by&#13;
using the brand name, trademark or 'stamp of approval' of well known&#13;
foreign companies. Part of the explanation will be provided in Chapters&#13;
VI and VII on moral hazard and adverse selection.&#13;
17/ This is discussed further in section 4.7 below.&#13;
18/ If both L and r are specified, collateral would be still higher and&#13;
expected firm profits still lower. If L, r and C are all specified at&#13;
the identical expectation levels, bank expected profits would be negative&#13;
and firm expected profits greater than for the unconstrained&#13;
(differential expectations) solution.&#13;
19/ These signs are the same as those obtained in the identical expectations&#13;
case.&#13;
20/ Collateral restrictions are considered in section 4.7.&#13;
21/   Inter Alia, it imposes smaller information requirements on the policy&#13;
maker.&#13;
22/ The loan interest rate could be positively or negatively related in both&#13;
identical and differential expectation cases.&#13;
23/ Acceptability depends on the socio-economic and the economic-legal&#13;
system. This also raises questions of moral hazard which are considered&#13;
in a later section.&#13;
24/ The other policies will result in similar paradoxes.&#13;
25/ In the conventional case we also have WL/Ui &lt; 0.&#13;
26/ C must fall if P = PF is to be restored, as the initial rise in r due to&#13;
a rise in 9 (or i or t) makes PF negative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -&#13;
27/  We expect similar results for the interest and collateral subsidy&#13;
policies. The type of rationing equilibrium obtained by Modigliani and&#13;
Jaffee (1969) is similar to that obtained here under interest rate&#13;
ceilings. That is, if the interest rate for the firm has to be equal to&#13;
some rate r which is less than the unconstrained optimal, rationing will&#13;
result as in their model.&#13;
&#13;

1/   This can easily be shown using the supply demand diagrams or by total&#13;
differentiation.&#13;
2/   This is true as long as the assumption that the banks pessimism factor is&#13;
greater than that of the firm is satisfied.&#13;
3/   Average profits would tend to rise if firm's expected mean is closer to&#13;
the 'actual' or 'true' mean.&#13;
4/   See Holt (1980)&#13;
5/   This has elements of the 'Vickery auction' considered by Holt (1980).&#13;
The present model could be reframed along the lines of Holt's paper to&#13;
yield a slightly different solution.&#13;
6/   This may not be true if borrowing is for a specialized productive&#13;
activity like textiles, brassware etc. In this case knowledge of the&#13;
banker plays as important a role as mere physical contiguity and&#13;
information flow, as information has to be interpreted correctly to be&#13;
meaningful.&#13;
7/   If the new bank has lower transaction costs or has access to cheaper&#13;
funds these and subsequent statements would have to be modified.&#13;

11/ Again we are ignoring differences in transaction costs and cost of bank&#13;
funds, and focussing on differences in perception.&#13;
12/ The Syndicate Bank has induced individuals to deposit savings at the bank&#13;
with promises of future loans.&#13;
13/ See Benston and-Smith (1979), Bhatt (1978), Bhatt and Roe (1979).&#13;
14/ t = 0 also.&#13;
15/ There were probably also innovations in banking which reduced the risk to&#13;
bank depositors. However these are outside the scope of the present&#13;
paper.&#13;

1/   A more general model can be built but is relegated to a subsequent&#13;
paper. Some of the implications are discussed briefly below.&#13;
2/   A sufficient condition is (1+r)L &gt; Cma.&#13;
3/   Clearly dishonest firms must present a demand curve similar to that of'&#13;
honest ones in order to obtain a loan. Their actual demand is infinite,&#13;
and they would easily be detected if they did not present a facade of&#13;
honesty.&#13;
4/   See Posner (1980)&#13;
5/   See for e.g. Braverman and Srinivasan (1980), Mitra (1980).&#13;
6/   See Ladman and Tinnermeier.&#13;
7/   This is suggested by Anderson and Khambata in their study (1980) of&#13;
government-induced lending by banks to small entrepreneurs. See pages 9&#13;
and 50 and Chapter 8 of this study.&#13;
8/   This is more likely for short term lending, and suggests that governments&#13;
should not force banks to start lending long to unfamiliar borrowers,&#13;
thus compounding their problems. Short term lending will itself generate&#13;
information of value for future loans.&#13;
9/   It is likely that, this is how spontaneous innovations in banking have&#13;
actually resulted. Note, however, that initial monopoly profits may&#13;
disappear entirely during this process which can be observed by other&#13;
banks. On the other hand, it is unlikely that other firms can&#13;
instantaneously and costlessly acquire the innovation.&#13;

1/   The extension to n &gt; 2 types is quite straightforward.&#13;
2/   The generalization to n subgroups is obvious:&#13;
f(y)     pl p1f(y,E1)  Fpi = 1.&#13;
3/   In the competitive case.&#13;
4/    f(y) is similarly the probability weighted average of the probability&#13;
density of return functions for firms from the two sub-groups.&#13;
5/   Assuming existence at non-zero supply and demand.&#13;
6/   The effect on expected profits is uncertain.    This is seen from the&#13;
differential expectation case if we change the firm's parameter e'&#13;
instead of the bank's parameter O.&#13;

o'B   bpF&#13;
p = O)7w(e get -a-     0 so that -5O +  -  = 0 where ff represents the&#13;
risk factor.&#13;
2/   Note however that the expected value of repayment to the firm is&#13;
different from the banks expectation even in the identical expectations&#13;
case. This implies that loan size need no longer be optimal in the sense&#13;
defined in chapter III. The direction of change is ambiguous, however.&#13;

Appendix 1:&#13;
Given the definition of the shift function g(k-k) it is easy to show&#13;
that&#13;
fa,G(y,k)F(y,k)dy + fbaG(y+g,k)F(y)dg                                (1)&#13;
for all values of a' and b' where a=a'-g, b=b'-g, and G is any function of y&#13;
and k. We will use this equivalence throughout the paper.&#13;
The expected profits of the bank using figure 1 of text, are&#13;
PB= [(r-i-t)L-T]fb,dF(y,k) +    b [y-A-T-(i+t)L]dF(y,k)&#13;
+ [C-[l+i+t)L-T] afdF(y,k)                                           (2)&#13;
where r is the loan rate of interest, i the deposit rate of interest, or the&#13;
opportunity cost of funds to the bank, t and T are the variable and fixed&#13;
component transaction cost to the bank, C is the collateral, L the loan value,&#13;
b'= rL+A, a' =-(L-C)+A, A is the borrower firm's fixed transaction cost for&#13;
the loan. k=E+L is the total capital stock and y the return (gross of cost A)&#13;
of the firm from productive activity.&#13;
The above equation simplifies to&#13;
PB = X-(l+i+t)L-T                                                     (2)&#13;
X=(l+r)LfbdF(y) + fb RdF(y) + CIa dF(y)                              (3)&#13;
where R=L+y+g-A. a=-(L-C)+A-g, b=rL+A-g, and X given in (3) is the bank's&#13;
expectation of the gross repayment (principal plus interest) to it by the&#13;
firm. -1 The middle term of (3) can be integrated by parts to obtain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
JaRdF(y)=(L+g-A)(F[b]-F[a] + yF[y] a- JF(y)dy&#13;
=(l+f)LF[b] - CF[a] - fbF(y)dy&#13;
On substituting this in (3) and that in (2), we obtain&#13;
P =(r-i-t)L-T - fbF(y)dy                                             (2")&#13;
B=f&#13;
For a loan to be made profits must be non-negative. From (2"), this&#13;
means that if T is positive, or a &lt; b i.e. (l+r)L &gt; C, r &gt; i+t.&#13;
For given r and C, the bank maximizes its expected profits.&#13;
Differentiating (1) we have&#13;
ap                                                                    (4)&#13;
= XL - (1+i+t) =&#13;
where XL = (l+r) f'dF(y) + (1+g)f bdF(y)                                         (5)&#13;
is the differential of X with respect to L. On subtracting one from both&#13;
sides of (4) we have&#13;
rJbdF(y) + g' fbdF(y)=fa dF(y) + i + t                               (4')&#13;
which can be re-written, for expositional simplicity using (1) as&#13;
f, dF(y,K) + g'f b,dF(y,K)=f dF(y)y,K) + i + t&#13;
which is the same as (2) of text.&#13;
The second order conditions for a maximum are&#13;
2= X    = -(r-g')2f[b] + g"fa dF(y) + (l+g')2f[a] &lt; O                  (6)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -&#13;
where XLL is the second order differential of X with respect to L, and g' and&#13;
g" are the first and second order differentials of g(k-k) with respect to its&#13;
argument. The first two terms in (6) are negative while the last is non-&#13;
negative.   Given that f[-w]=0, the last term must be zero for a &lt; -w or&#13;
L &gt; C+A-w-g. Therefore XLL must be negative beyond some L less than this.&#13;
We also know that PB=O for L=O. Further from (2')&#13;
im BP = fim [(r-i-t)L - T f|dF(y)]+     rfbI [y-A-T-(i+t)L1dF(y)&#13;
= 0 + f_ ydF(y) - (i+t) Em L = -&#13;
and from (4) and (5) we have,&#13;
Lim                m   dF(Y) +   im4  gl dF(y) - (1+i+t)&#13;
- g -(i+t) &lt; 0    as Li   g' = g &lt; i+t.&#13;
Ignoring inflection points, this shows that if a unique solution to&#13;
(4) exists, it must be a maximum, and if there is more than one solution there&#13;
must be at least a maximum and minimum. If there is no non-negative solution&#13;
to (4'), then the maximum must be at L=O. We will assume in the text that an&#13;
interior solution exists, and that there is a single maximum (and perhaps a&#13;
minimum). XLL &lt; 0 is therefore assumed to be satisfied at equilibrium.&#13;
It is interesting to note that there is no maximum of PB with respect&#13;
to r or C:&#13;
a    = X   = Lfb dF(y) &gt; 0, '=' only if f(y)=O for y &gt; W &lt;&#13;
X     =     MydF(y) &gt; 0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -&#13;
We also have&#13;
T= -1,           0,  -AF = 1 and       = 0, -B = XE &gt; 0&#13;
Equation (4) has the implicit solution&#13;
LB = LB(r,C)&#13;
For any given C, the slope of the LB curve in (L,r) space is obtained&#13;
by totally differentiating (4) and (5) as&#13;
dLB      XLr                                                           (8)&#13;
dr       XLL&#13;
aXL                                  &gt;0 if g' &gt; r&#13;
where XLr =          fr bdF(y) + L(g'-r)f[b] =    &gt;                              (8')&#13;
&lt;0 if g' &lt; r&#13;
we also have&#13;
kLrr= -2Lf[b] + (g'-r)L f'[b] &lt; 0.&#13;
If we plot XL as function of r(for given L), it must have either of two&#13;
patterns for r &lt; g' and similarly for r &gt; g', which are shown as I' and II',&#13;
and I and II respectively on the figure below:&#13;
XLI&#13;

/II             rr&#13;
g'     r'                ~~~~~~~~r&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 162 -&#13;
From (4) the solution of L is at XL=1+i+t. It is apparent therefore that if&#13;
XL has the shape of curve I, XLr &gt; 0, and if it has the shape of curve II,&#13;
XLr &gt; 0 for lower r and XLr &lt; 0 for higher r. Therefore LB must have either&#13;
of the two following shapes (with XLL &lt; 0),&#13;
LB                                     LB&#13;
r                                   r&#13;
Figure        XLr &gt; 0                      Figure        XLr Z&#13;
It is shown in the text that equilibrium will be on the rising portion of the&#13;
curve in the second case also. Therefore XLr &gt; 0 for subsequent analysis.&#13;
We also have from (4) and (5)&#13;
aLB     XLC                                                          (9)&#13;

as XLC '      = -(l+g')f[a] &lt; 0                                               (9')&#13;
In the figures above, the curves shift down as C rises. The following&#13;
differentials are also useful for subsequent analysis:&#13;
aLB   aLB     1  &lt; 0                                                (10)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

aLB     XLE&gt;                        asX     &gt;  Â°                     (11)&#13;

where E is the equity contribution of the firm.&#13;
The last term in (11') is negative, as g" &lt; 0, and represents the decrease in&#13;
marginal productivity, of a given loan L, as equity E increases. The first&#13;
two terms on the right represent the change/increase (if r &gt; g') in&#13;
expectation of repayment in the partial and full repayment sections (y &gt; a).&#13;
(LB     XLALA                                                        (2&#13;

XLA = -(1+g')f[a] - (r-g')f[b] =.&lt; 0 for r &gt; g'                     (12')&#13;
A  0 for r &lt; g'&#13;
It is shown subsequently that for the identical expectations case g'=i+t and&#13;
therefore r &gt; g'. We will assume in most of the analysis that r &gt; g'&#13;
continues to hold even if expectations are not identical.&#13;
Given the definition of O in equation (5) of section II, we can re-&#13;
write XL from (5) as&#13;
XL=(l+r) - (r-g')F[b] - (1+g')F[a]                                    (5')&#13;
ThenX     =-    &lt; 0                       if r &gt; g'                             (14)&#13;
LO    be_&#13;
We have already suggested that r &gt; g' for the identical expectations case (as&#13;
will be shown below). We will assume throughout this paper that even if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 -&#13;
r &lt; g', in the non-identical expectations case an increase in pessimism&#13;
factor O raises r but may raise or lower g'.&#13;
We will use the same notation for the firm's subjective distribution&#13;
of its returns, F(y). The only place where f(y) and F(y) occur are in the&#13;
expectation of repayment, and for the firm we will relabel this (X) as X'.&#13;
The expected profits of the firm are&#13;
F = f b(y_rLA)dF(y,K) + |a(y+L-C-A)dF(y,K)&#13;
= L+y+g-X'-A                                                          (15)&#13;
where X'=(l+r)L f'dF(y) + fbRdF(y) + C|     dF(y)                               (16)&#13;
fbdFy      a            -w&#13;
R=L+y+g-A, a = (L-C)+A-g, b = rL+A-g and X' is identical to X except that F(y)&#13;
is the firms subjective distribution instead of the bank's. Differentiating&#13;
PF with respect to L and re-arranging, we have&#13;
L=                                                              (17)&#13;
and the second order condition is&#13;
g"-X LL=g"(1- IbdF(y)) - (l+g')g'f[a] + (r-g') f[b] &lt; 0                         (18)&#13;
which will be asummed to be satisfied.&#13;
We can solve (17) to obtain the loan demand for the firm as a&#13;
function of r and C,&#13;
LF=LF(r,C)&#13;
Differentiating as before, we have&#13;
aLF   X' Lr    &lt;                                                     (19)&#13;
~~~Tr   I  &gt;     as XL    (  0&#13;
br     ~LL           L&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 165 -&#13;
Thus the sign of (19) is exactly the opposite of (8), the corresponding&#13;
differential for LB in the identical expectations case, i.e. if XL=X'L.        This&#13;
is true of the differential of LF with respect to E , C, and A so that it is&#13;
not necessary to repeat the earlier analysis. The only significant difference&#13;
is that LF is independent of the bank deposit rate i, and the variable&#13;
component of bank transaction cost, t. For XL # X'L due to differential&#13;
expectations, the earlier analysis also applies, after modification with&#13;
negative sign.   This means that in (L,r) space the LF curve has negative&#13;
slope, or a negative slope followed by a positive. Further this curve shifts&#13;
up for a rise in C or e.&#13;
For a change in E we have, using (11')&#13;
aLF     XLE -      (r-g')g'f[b]+g'(1+g')f(a)-g"(1-fbdF(y)) &lt; 0&#13;
bE        g -XLL                 g"  - XLL&#13;
It will be useful to obtain the shape of the isoprofit curves in&#13;
(L,r) space for any given C.    For the bank, implicitly differentiating (2) and&#13;
solving, we have&#13;
B           r&#13;
Br       (XLi-t-i) &gt; 0 as XL &gt; i+t+1&#13;
Recalling that XL = i+t+1 at optimality the isoprofit curve must&#13;
have negative slope below and positive slope above the LB curve. Further&#13;
as bPB/bC &gt; 0, profits must increase to the northeast along the LB curve. For&#13;
the firm we have from (15)&#13;
F =      r   &gt;Â°as 1+g      XL&#13;
- 1+g       as1+gXL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 166 -&#13;
As l+g'=XL at the demand curve LF, this slope must be positive below&#13;
this curve and negative above it.         Further as     P F/6C &lt; 0 profits must increase&#13;
to the northwest along the LF curve.&#13;
We can also obtain the (Frechet) differentials of X and XL as&#13;
follows:&#13;

Appendix 2: Identical Expectations&#13;
In the identical expectations case the subjective distributions of&#13;
the return's to the productive activity for which the loan is desired, are the&#13;
same for the bank and the firm. That is, X=X' and all their derivatives are&#13;
also identical. From (4) and (17) we obtain the equilibrium conditions for L&#13;
and r given C as,&#13;
g'(E+L-k) = i+t                                               (20)&#13;
XL = i+t+1                                                (4)&#13;
From the first equation L can be determined as a function of E, i and t&#13;
L = g -1(i+t)-E+k                                            (20')&#13;
Using the implicit differential of (20) in (4) we have&#13;
Ldr=LCdCdXLEIAdA+(kXkdE)dE+ -               ,LL   (di+dt)         (21)&#13;
On subsituting from (6) and (11') it is seen that&#13;
XLL-XLE= -r(r-g')f[b] &lt; 0&#13;
Therefore, we have, recalling the analysis of the previous section,&#13;
br &gt; 0,   br &gt; 0,   Dr &lt; 0,  br &gt; 0,   or    br &lt; 0          (22)&#13;
ac       a;o-       aEa                 i    at&#13;
Note that r and C are independent of A and T.      If we differentiate the banks&#13;
expected profit function (2) using (4) and (7) to simplify, we have&#13;
dC= XC +     C X  &gt; 0                                        (23)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
and similarly for the firm's expected profits,&#13;
dPF      Cr                                                   (23')&#13;
-i-= -x    - x   -R-&lt; 0                                        2&#13;
Note that the sum of the expected profits does not change. If perfect&#13;
competition in the bank loan market is defined, as is usual, by the zero&#13;
profit condition, we get two cases.      One in which PB 1      4 0 and the other&#13;
B C=O&#13;
in which PBI      &gt; 0.  We will deal here with the former.       From (2) we must&#13;
have&#13;
X=(1+i+t)L+T                                                    (24)&#13;
Equilibrium values of L,r and C are then determined by equations (20), (24)&#13;
and (4). Implicitly differentiating these equations, simplifying and solving,&#13;
we have&#13;
diC&#13;
rl      1   XLC    -xc     L       L         -XE       -XA  1   -X0]    dE     (25)&#13;

Using equation (2") in appendix 1&#13;
X      a=     =       f       dy &lt;                  0 as 6F[y,0] &gt; O&#13;
a&#13;
for all y and "&gt; 0" for at least one y. XE is the direct effect on bank's&#13;
expectations of profits due to change in subjective e for a given loan&#13;
contract (L,r,C).&#13;

If we step outside the model to consider how equity E may be deter-&#13;
mined, we obtain an interesting result.       Let the opportunity cost of equity&#13;
funds to the firm be h(E), h' &gt; 0. For any given L optimality requires&#13;
g'(E+L-K) = h'(E)&#13;
Differentiating and solving we have -E =        v--  &lt; 0 if h" &gt; g" as is required&#13;
for a maxima. This is definitely fulfilled if h" &gt; 0 i.e. if the marginal&#13;
cost of obtaining equity is non-decreasing with E. We have shown above that&#13;
in the loan market -aLE = -1. For global equilibrium, we must have h'(E)=i+t.&#13;
i.e. Identical expectations automatically ensures optimal allocation of&#13;
equity funds.&#13;
In the monopoly case, (24) is replaced by the following equation&#13;
F=L+7y+g-A-X, where PF is the profit of the firm in the absence of any loan&#13;
transaction, or the opportunity cost of funds if E &lt; k. This can be solved&#13;
along with (20) and (4). Totally differentiating and solving these equations&#13;
we obtain,&#13;

Xr -X      Xc = L(b dF(y) -    f   (y)  adF(y))&#13;

F'[a]             &gt;  0a            e'(34)&#13;
where F'(y) = F'(y,O') = F(y,O'), F(y) = F(y,O); we have shown earlier&#13;
that 6F &gt; 0. Therefore for 0 &gt; O' we have F[a] &gt; F'[a] and F[b] &gt; F'[b] or 1-&#13;
F'[b] &lt; 1-F'[b] we could also have a degnerate case in which both inequalities&#13;
are replaced by equalities, but we will ignore this case.&#13;

To analyze the effect of interest ceilings, first solve (4) and (17)&#13;

The last differential shows that if there is a competitive equili-&#13;
brium, with PB = 0, at (L*,r,C), putting a ceiling rg &lt; r on loan interest&#13;
rates will make bank profits negative. Therefore a non-rationed equilibrium&#13;
cannot exist. However a rationing equilibrium does exist; In this case LF&gt;LB&#13;
so that equation (4') is still satisfied.       Solving this with the zero profit&#13;
condition (24), we have&#13;
x&#13;
dC = - - dr &gt; 0 for dr &lt; 0&#13;

XC~~~~&#13;
dL  -     (XL    X   X    c) dr &lt;  O  for dr &lt; O&#13;
To analyze the corner solution for C &gt; Cma the maximum acceptable&#13;
collateral, consider equation (32). This shows that banks expectation of&#13;
profits PB must be negative at C = Cma, and therefore an equilibrium with&#13;
demand equal to supply does not exist. However an excess supply equilibrium&#13;
can exist; In this case LB &gt; LF, and (17) and (24) are satisfied.&#13;
Differentiating and solving we obtain&#13;

When J5 &gt; O, PB falls below zero if L &lt; L* so that an unrationed&#13;

increases and a demand-supply balance exists, but at a point where the bank is&#13;
making monopoly profits. However a competitive equilibrium with rationing is&#13;
possible in both cases, with LF &gt; LB. Solving (17) and (24) we have&#13;

To analyze the effect of interest subsidies or taxes, we replace r in&#13;
the bank equations (4) and (24) by r+rs where rs is the subsidy. Then for the&#13;
competitive case we can solve (4), (17) and (24) as before. The only changes&#13;

are, to add the term - X- drs on the right of (24'), and the terms&#13;

To analyze the effect of government guarantee programs in case of&#13;
default, we consider two types of guarantees:              One in which the government&#13;
promises to pay the bank a lump sum CO in case of default, and the other case&#13;
in which it agrees to pay a proportion sC of the (ensured) recovery C. C in&#13;
the bank's equation is replaced by C + CO and C(l+s) respectively in the two&#13;
cases. As in the interest subsidy case this adds -dCo (or -Cds) on the right&#13;
of equation (24').       Similarly it adds -XLLdCo (or - XjCCds)           to equation&#13;
(17). Therefore we obtain&#13;

We turn next to the case of Adverse selection. Re-arranging the&#13;

X   E  pXI   +  (1-p)X2     =  (1+i+t)L + T&#13;
We can totally differentiate these equations and solve. From the&#13;
last equations we have&#13;
dC   -        (X dr + (X&#13;

            The nature of credit markets in developing
            countries : a framework for policy analysis
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The central purpose of the paper is to
            analyze various forms of government intervention in the loan
            market in terms of their effect on efficiency. This provides
            the essential basis for evaluating and judging these
            policies. It also shows where earlier policy prescriptions
            are correct, incomplete or wrong. One of the implications of
            the paper is that the credit market differs fundamentally
            from the market for ordinary goods and services.
            Consequently conventional analysis of the loan markets,
            based on theory applicable to these goods, can be misleading
            even when similar prescriptions are reached. This is because
            the similarity may be restricted to special circumstances.
            Another important highlight of the paper is the vital role
            of collateral in the loan market. These two issues are
            addressed in the introductory discussion on the special
            nature of credit markets, which forms an important
            prerequisite for understanding the subsequent section and
            the rest of the paper.
