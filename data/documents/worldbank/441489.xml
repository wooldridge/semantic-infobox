In this context, concern for the financial solvency of   degree by all countries that carry out some supervi-&#13;
insurers stems from two principal sources: a fear that    sion.) This Note describes the two supervisory methods.&#13;
insurers may offer coverage at low premiums and fail&#13;
to maintain sufficient reserves to pay future claims           Irrespective of the regulatory approach, however, the&#13;

approaches to insurance supervision have arisen in    ing authority for their supervision. (This legislation&#13;

company adherence to these rules while letting the           insurer because the long-term  insurance contracts&#13;

developed by the local professional association of actuaries  can be ceded to unauthorized, usually foreign, reinsurers. A&#13;

            Insurance regulations primarily aim to
            protect the interests of consumers and investors and to
            safeguard the soundness and solvency of insurance companies.
            Close regulation and supervision are justified by the high
            information costs associated with insurance products. These
            information costs arise from three main sources: (1) the
            complexity of contractual terms and conditions of coverage
            that put consumers at a considerable disadvantage against
            insurance companies and their agents; (2) the need to pool
            the insured with different risk characteristics into
            relatively homogeneous groups which can cause problems for
            both consumers and insurance companies; and (3) the
            difficulty of assessing the financial soundness of insurers.
            This Note explains how regulators address these problems.
