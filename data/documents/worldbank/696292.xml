RURAL MUNICIPALITIES' PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN&#13;
1.1   In March 1994 the Government of Nicaragua requested IDA assistance in&#13;
preparing a project that: (i) would have a large social impact on the poorest groups in&#13;
the country's main agricultural region (Departments of Le6n and Chinandega in the&#13;
Pacific region); and (ii) would address natural resource issues in this region and in the&#13;
forest areas most threatened by agricultural expansion (Department of Rio San Juan,&#13;
and portions of the Department of Chontales, and the Autonomous Regions of the&#13;
South and North Atlantic). The proposed Departments and Regions had already been&#13;
categorized as highest priority in the country's National Environmental Action Plan&#13;
(NEAP), completed in 1993 and supported by IDA.&#13;
1.2   The National Agricultural Council's (CONAGRO) request for a project that&#13;
would simultaneously tackle rural poverty and natural resources was consistent with&#13;
IDA's country strategy. Nicaragua is the second poorest country in Latin America&#13;
and poverty is essentially a rural phenomenon. The rural poor are located in areas of&#13;
fragile natural resources. There is an intimate link between rural poverty and natural&#13;
resource (environmental) degradation. Rural poverty is an immediate cause of natural&#13;
resource degradation and natural resource degradation constrains the economic&#13;
opportunities of the rural poor. Lagging rural investment in the heavily populated&#13;
Pacific region is a factor underlying the increased migration to the especially fragile&#13;
Atlantic region.&#13;
1.3   Project preparation, financed by the Government of Japan, the Fund for&#13;
Innovative Approaches in Human and Social Development (FIAHS), the Dutch Trust&#13;
Fund and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) began in December 1994 and was&#13;
carried out by a team of consultants under the supervision of the National Agricultural&#13;
Council (CONAGRO), with assistance from the Regional Unit for Technical&#13;
Assistance for Agriculture and Rural Development in Central America (RUTA III). An&#13;
IDA pre-appraisal mission reviewed the project in August 1995, and the appraisal&#13;
mission took place in February/March 1996.&#13;
The term municipality is used throughout this report as a translation for the Spanish municipio.&#13;
As used in most of Latin America the municipio refers to a geographical and admninistrative&#13;
division that includes both urban and rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.4   During preparation, the objectives of rural poverty reduction and improved&#13;
natural resource management remained essentially unchanged, but it became very clear&#13;
that these objectives could be met only if the project placed a strong emphasis on&#13;
improving the capacity of local institutions in rural areas (municipal governments, local&#13;
NGOs and community organizations) to develop coherent community and municipal&#13;
investment plans within which viable subprojects could be designed and implemented.&#13;
This view was supported by the following considerations:&#13;
*  Growing evidence from Bank projects in Latin America that decentralized&#13;
rural development can be a successful strategy for reducing rural poverty.&#13;
*  Field assessments carried out during preparation indicating that local&#13;
institutions have a clear understanding of the needs of rural populations&#13;
and the priorities for natural resource management.&#13;
*  The lack of sustainable capacity in Nicaragua, at either the local or&#13;
national level, to assist the rural poor, to apply and enforce natural&#13;
resources policies, to manage protected areas, to ensure preservation of&#13;
key biodiversity values or to deal with the serious issues of indigenous&#13;
land tenure, especially in the Atlantic Region.&#13;
*  The on-going reform of local government, supported by IDA's&#13;
Institutional Development Credit (Credit No. 2690-NI), the formation of&#13;
the Sectoral Decentralization Commission (SDC), and the partial reform&#13;
of the Constitution (June 1995) including fiscal decentralization and the&#13;
proposed new Municipalities Law now in the National Assembly.&#13;
1.5   Given these factors, preparation focused strongly on the technical and&#13;
institutional needs of local government to develop viable subprojects aimed at rural&#13;
poverty alleviation and natural resource management. At the same time, it was&#13;
recognized that rural decentralization does pose environmental risks. Local&#13;
institutions do not easily internalize issues which extend beyond the local level.&#13;
Therefore, project preparation continued to develop components which would address&#13;
global, national and regional issues, as follows:&#13;
*  Global issues, of which conservation of biodiversity in the Atlantic is the&#13;
most important, are to be addressed by an associated project which will be&#13;
submitted to the GEF Council for funding by the end of 1996.&#13;
*  National issues are addressed through a technical assistance component&#13;
designed to enable GON to carry out a coherent policy and institutional&#13;
framework for natural resources and the environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Regional issues are addressed through an environment and land use&#13;
planning and monitoring system included in the project.&#13;
1.6   Preparation of the associated GEF project started in November 1995,&#13;
immediately after the National Assembly ratified the Convention on Biological&#13;
Diversity. It is expected that the GEF proposal will be submitted to the GEF Council&#13;
for endorsement before the end of 1996 and that appraisal will take place in early&#13;
1997. This timing is consistent with the proposed phasing of the project, which&#13;
consists of three phases, the first two supported by IDA and the third phase supported&#13;
by both IDA and GEF. The GEF supported activities are conceived as an integral part&#13;
of phase 3 of the Rural Municipalities Project (paragraph 6.24).&#13;
B. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONTEXT&#13;
1.7   During the last four years the Nicaraguan economy has undergone a&#13;
stabilization effort accompanied by a strong fiscal adjustment. Recently the economy&#13;
has begun to turn around as demonstrated by a 3.3% GDP growth in 1994 and 4.2%&#13;
in 1995 due in part to recovery of the agricultural sector. In the agricultural sector&#13;
basic grains (corn, beans, rice and sorghum) account for approximately 40 percent of&#13;
total agricultural GDP. A similar proportion of agricultural GDP is accounted for by&#13;
livestock. The primary sector accounts for about 33% of total GDP.&#13;
1.8   From the outset the proposed project was seen as a means of alleviating rural&#13;
poverty. Nicaragua is the second poorest country in Latin America. Per capita&#13;
income in Nicaragua was halved during the 1980s to less than US$400 (World Bank,&#13;
Review of Social Sector Issues, 1993). In 1993 infant mortality was over 70 per 1,000&#13;
live births and illiteracy affected over 20 percent of the population. According to the&#13;
IDA's Poverty Assessment (1995), more than 50 percent of the population is below&#13;
the poverty line and almost 20 percent below the extreme poverty line, defined as an&#13;
inability to afford minimum calorie intake. These poverty statistics are far worse than&#13;
for any other country in Central America.&#13;
19   In Nicaragua, as in most poor countries, the incidence of poverty is especially&#13;
high in rural areas. A high proportion of the total population (41 percent) and of the&#13;
poor (63 percent) and extremely poor (78%) lives in rural areas. Seventy six percent&#13;
of the rural population are poor and 36 percent extremely poor, compared to 32&#13;
percent and 7 percent, respectively, for the urban population. Sanitary services are&#13;
available to only 16 percent of the rural population, and drinking water to only 19&#13;
percent (UNDP, Report on Human Development, 1993). The poorest rural regions&#13;
are Segovias and the Northern Region, followed by the Western Region. The lowest&#13;
incidence of poverty is found in Managua and in parts of the relatively unpopulated&#13;
Atlantic Region.&#13;
1.10  Economic growth, particularly in the rural sector, will help alleviate rural&#13;
poverty. But the rural poverty problem is so serious and widespread in the country&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
that without specific initiatives targeted at reducing rural poverty it is unlikely that the&#13;
conditions of the rural poor will improve for many years.&#13;
C. LAND USE, RuRAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCE&#13;
DEGRADATION&#13;
1.11  Nicaragua's natural resources are under increasing threats from expanded&#13;
agriculture, livestock and forestry production in fragile areas. The country's total land&#13;
area is approximately 12 million hectares, of which only 1.3 million hectares are&#13;
considered arable. However the land area actually used for agriculture is almost 2&#13;
million hectares, far in excess of the sustainable potential. A further 4.4 million&#13;
hectares of extremely poor quality land has been cleared for pasture. Another 2.6&#13;
mnillion hectares are classified as "production forests", but are mostly subject to&#13;
unmanaged exploitation and few resource rents accrue to local communities. About&#13;
3.4 million hectares, or 28 percent of the national territory, mostly in the Atlantic zone,&#13;
a region known for its pristine tropical rain forests and wetlands and the fragility of its&#13;
soils, is untouched, except by the subsistence activities of indigenous communities.&#13;
1.12  In addition to problems caused by the expanding agricultural frontier, a major&#13;
problem is the inappropriate use of those lands which have already been cleared,&#13;
notably in the Pacific Zone and in the poor Northern Region. Rural areas are&#13;
decapitalized due to lagging investment, deterioration of the physical capital and&#13;
degradation of the natural capital. Farming and grazing systems tend to be extensive&#13;
with low inputs of labor, fertilizer and water per unit of land. Livestock is reared on&#13;
mostly unimproved pastures with stocking rates ranging from about I animal unit per&#13;
hectare in the humid Atlantic Zone to 1.5 animal units per hectare in the sub-humid&#13;
Pacific Zone.&#13;
1.13  Despite deep, fertile volcanic soils, in Nicaragua's Pacific Northwestern zone&#13;
(Le6n and Chinandega) unemployment is high and land productivity low. This zone&#13;
contains about 15 % of the total land area and 25% of the country's population with&#13;
nearly 100 people/km2. In the target communities of Le6n and Chinandega, the&#13;
available farming land can only sustain about one third of the population at current&#13;
levels of technology. A typical farm household (of about 5.7 people living off a farm of&#13;
fewer than 7 hectares) derives an income of about US$130 per capita, which is well&#13;
below the extreme poverty line, and in one of the target areas of the project 31% of&#13;
the population lives in households with fewer than 1.4 hectares (average income of&#13;
US$220 per family per year) or with no land at all (9%).&#13;
1.14  In contrast, in the Atlantic zone soils are typical of the high rainfall humid&#13;
tropics, i.e. highly weathered, acidic and of low fertility and there are also natural pine&#13;
savannas of very poor soils and a complex system of wetlands. This zone contains&#13;
almost 50 percent of the total land area of the country, but only 6 percent of its people&#13;
with a density of only 3 people/km2. The majority of inhabitants of the Atlantic region&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
are indigenous (43%) and of African origin (15%) and the total population is about&#13;
250,000 people.&#13;
1.15  Traditionally, the Atlantic has been a zone of forest exploitation, mining,&#13;
fisheries, limited migratory agriculture and indigenous subsistence activities, but this&#13;
situation is changing. Recent years have seen a sharp rise in its population, as poor&#13;
families have migrated from the Northern and Western region and as Government has&#13;
sought land on which to settle ex-combatants. This has resulted in a high rate of forest&#13;
clearing for subsistence farming, followed by expansion of extensive livestock&#13;
operations, as farming has proven to be unsustainable.&#13;
1.16  The interaction of poverty and resource degradation is illustrated, not only by&#13;
the destructive use of the Atlantic forests, but also by a high rate of soil erosion, which&#13;
is a particular threat to sustainable agriculture in the Pacific zone. Nationally, 7.7&#13;
million hectares (64% of the country) are affected by erosion with 1.1 million hectares&#13;
suffering from serious water erosion and 155,000 hectares, 27% of the best&#13;
agricultural lands, subject to wind erosion. Adding to the pressure on land is the&#13;
return of demobilized soldiers and refugees, of whom it is estimated that 250,000 will&#13;
seek land in the near future. These new settlers will join the ranks of poor farmers in&#13;
the hillsides of the Pacific, Northern and Segovia regions or will seek subsistence on&#13;
the fragile lands of the Atlantic zone.&#13;
2. INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES&#13;
A. OVERALL RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
2.1   Three different levels of government intervene in rural development and natural&#13;
resource management. Nicaragua is divided into 141 municipalities. These&#13;
municipalities are grouped in Regions and Departments, but these do not have&#13;
administrative roles except for the two Autonomous Regions in the Atlantic.2&#13;
At the national level, the National Assembly has responsibility for elaborating decrees&#13;
and laws, which may be initiated by legislators or by the President of the Republic,&#13;
who may also publish executive decrees in administrative matters, regulate the laws&#13;
and legislate by delegation of the National Assembly. The govermnents of the&#13;
autonomous regions, North Atlantic Autonomous Region and South Atlantic&#13;
Autonomous Region (RAAN and RAAS) have legal jurisdiction over the use of water,&#13;
forests, community (indigenous) lands and their environmental protection. Through&#13;
the Regional Councils regional governments issue "regional directives" (ordenanzas&#13;
regionales) which regulate regional affairs. Municipal governrments legislate through&#13;
2   Regions and Departments were eliminated in the Partial Reform of the Constitution of 1995,&#13;
with the exception of the Autonomous Regions of the Atlantic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
"municipal directives" (ordenanzas municipales) in matters expressly stated in the&#13;
National Municipalities Law.&#13;
B. SECTOR COORDINATION&#13;
2.2   CONAGRO. The National Agricultural Council (CONAGRO) was created in&#13;
1993 by presidential decree to coordinate policies and activities in the rural sector.&#13;
Since 1994 CONAGRO has grown in importance, having assumed the key role for&#13;
rural development, coordinating the activities of the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG),&#13;
the Institute of Natural Resources (IRENA, now assumed by a Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Natural Resources -- MARENA), and the National Institutes of&#13;
Agrarian Reform (INRA) and Agricultural Technology (INTA), with financing from&#13;
the IDA Agricultural Technology and Land Management Project (Credit No. 2536-&#13;
NI). CONAGRO has placed high on its agenda issues relating to the management of&#13;
natural resources. CONAGRO also oversees the PNDR (Programa Nacional de&#13;
Desarollo Rurat), which was recently created to coordinate an IDB financed project&#13;
of the same name.&#13;
C. NATURAL RESOURCES INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES&#13;
2.3   MARENA. In January 1994, a new Ministry of Environment and Natural&#13;
Resources (MARENA) was created out of the former IRENA by Presidential Decree&#13;
1-94. It now has the authority to: (i) coordinate and direct all public policy towards&#13;
natural resources; (ii) promote sustainable use of natural resources; and (iii) propose&#13;
laws, regulations, standards and strategies for sustainable use and protection of natural&#13;
resources and the environment through participatory processes.&#13;
2.4   These changes in the institutional structure for natural resources are a step&#13;
forward, but they do not in themselves change the fact that at the national level there is&#13;
a severe lack of capacity to develop policy or to implement it. The principal needs in&#13;
MARENA are the strengthening of the (i) unit for monitoring the use of natural&#13;
resources or the observance of laws and regulations governing their use; (ii) unit for&#13;
formulation and analysis of policies; (iii) unit in charge of tracking the implementation&#13;
of international treaties on climate and the environment; and (iv) unit overseeing&#13;
protected areas. In addition MARENA needs to develop (i) a strategy for dealing with&#13;
indigenous peoples issues; and (ii) its capacity to oversee the process of land use and&#13;
environmental planning. Finally, MARENA needs to assert its leadership in the sector&#13;
by providing training and technical assistance to other institutions on environmental&#13;
matters, in particular to: the National Assembly, charged with reviewing and&#13;
approving all environmental and natural resources legislation; the judicial system&#13;
(Supreme Court of Justice and the Attorney General's Office), charged with applying&#13;
it; specialized police and armed forces, which play an important part in enforcement&#13;
and which have already established agreements with MARENA for the monitoring of&#13;
parks and biological reserves, control of illegal logging, control of illegal trade in&#13;
wildlife, monitoring of turtle landings, and preventing and fighting forest fires; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
local governments which, given their expanding role in rural development and&#13;
envirornment, need a clearer understanding of their competencies and obligations.&#13;
2.5   Legal Frameworlk The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) notes&#13;
that the laws and policies governing ownership and use of natural resources are out-&#13;
dated. Nicaragua inherited from the eighties a legal framework based on central&#13;
planning and public ownership and control of natural resources which needs to be&#13;
reformed. This legal framework is inconsistent with current GON's strategy of&#13;
reducing the size of central government focusing its institutions on normative aspects,&#13;
it is inconsistent with the thrust towards privatization of important sectors of the&#13;
economy, and it is inconsistent with the rights of indigenous peoples and roles of&#13;
Regional and Municipal Governments as expressed in the Constitution and Autonomy&#13;
Law of 1987, the Partial Reform of the Constitution of 1995 and the proposed&#13;
Municipalities Law.&#13;
2.6   Nicaragua has already made some progress in rationalizing the legal&#13;
framework. Various laws are in draft form and proposals for laws covering forestry,&#13;
fisheries, mining, energy and contaminants are under discussion in the National&#13;
Assembly. A General Environmental Law was ratified in April 1996 covering a wide&#13;
range of subjects including natural resources and land use planning, the creation of a&#13;
National Environment Committee, an Environmental Fund and an Environment Unit in&#13;
the General Attorney's Office, the creation of a National System of Protected Areas,&#13;
the Environment Impact Assessment process and general guidelines on biodiversity,&#13;
forests, wildlife, water, soils and mnineral resources. The law gives MARENA the main&#13;
role in overseeing its implementation of the law and it also establishes new roles for&#13;
municipal governments in particular in executing land use and natural resources plans&#13;
and overseeing natural resources.&#13;
2.7   The General Environmental Law needs to be supplemented by complementary&#13;
regulations. New laws governing natural resources not well covered in existing&#13;
proposals (coastal zones, biodiversity, protected areas, soils and water) are also&#13;
needed as are regulations for each law (forests, mines, fisheries, coastal zones,&#13;
biodiversity, protected areas, soils, water, contaminants and energy) and support for&#13;
enforcement. New laws and regulations should help clarify the rights and obligations&#13;
of the private, social and public sectors as well as where local and regional&#13;
governments responsibilities begin and central government responsibilities end.&#13;
Significant conflict arises in the forestry and fishery sectors between local authorities&#13;
and communities, who want to reap the benefits from natural resources in their areas,&#13;
and natural resource users who capture most resource rents, but contribute little to&#13;
local development. The rights of communities inside protected areas also need to be&#13;
clarified and the inconsistencies between the rights of indigenous communities&#13;
expressed in the Constitution of 1987 (amended in 1995) and Autonomy Law of 1987&#13;
and existing and proposed natural resources legislation need to be resolved. However,&#13;
the technical capacity of GON to propose and regulate, and of the Assembly itself to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
review these proposals and to legislate on them is limited and technical assistance is&#13;
needed to support the legal and policy reform process.&#13;
2.8   Natural Resources Strategies. Government has made progress in developing&#13;
a national strategy for the environment and natural resources. A National Forestry&#13;
Action Plan (TFAP) was approved by Presidential Decree 246-92 on September 7,&#13;
1992. In the same decree, approval was given to the National Strategy for&#13;
Conservation and Sustainable Development (ECODESNIC) and a Strategy for&#13;
Environmental and Land Use Planning (EOAT). A National Environmental Action&#13;
Plan (NEAP) was approved by Presidential Decree 261-93 on December 3, 1993.&#13;
Together these plans provide a reasonable framework within which the following&#13;
priorities have been established for investment and institutional development (Annex&#13;
2): (i) soil conservation, water resource management and forestry; (ii) targeting of&#13;
resources to the Pacific Western Region, to the western part of the non-metropolitan&#13;
Managua Region, to the Segovias and Northem Regions and to the Atlantic Region;&#13;
(iii) integration of policy reform, coordinating the activities of the line ministry&#13;
(MARENA), the National Assembly, and the judiciary and enforcing agencies; (iv)&#13;
giving municipal governments and communities a say on how resources in their&#13;
jurisdictions are utilized and managed, decentralizing implementation of projects to the&#13;
municipal level; (v) participatory planning at the local level to guide public investment,&#13;
and (vi) better targeting of the benefits of resource use to local communities. All of&#13;
these aspects would be supported by the proposed project. MARENA has also issued&#13;
a draft Biodiversity Strategy which is now undergoing a process of public&#13;
consultation. This strategy assigns top priority to the conservation of a biological&#13;
corridor in the Atlantic region which would be supported by the GEF component of&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
D. RURAL DECENTRALIZATION&#13;
2.9   Rationale. Centralized public investment and natural resource management&#13;
decisions are one of the problems in the rural sector. Many local rural institutions --&#13;
local governments, NGOs and community organizations -- are weak because until&#13;
recently they have been side-stepped by public investment and natural resources&#13;
programs managed from the center. Decentralization of responsibility for planning and&#13;
investment decisions to the local level is extremely important for improving rural&#13;
development programs and the situation of the rural poor because it makes more likely&#13;
that genuine local development needs are met. Today this view is shared by the&#13;
Government, NGOs and foreign donors and is consistent with the process of reform of&#13;
central government institutions, which is being supported by IDA's Institutional&#13;
Development Credit (Credit No. 2690-NI). The principles underlying current thinking&#13;
on decentralization are that national priorities should be satisfied through broad&#13;
thematic and zonal targeting of investment resources and that local mechanisms should&#13;
be used for their specific disposition. In the few cases where "local choice"&#13;
mechanisms through municipal government and communities have already been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
functioning in Nicaragua the results have been generally positive. The GTZ/INIFOM&#13;
(Municipal Autonomy Project/Proyecto de Fortalecimiento de la Autonomia&#13;
Municipal) is one example, and the SIDAMINIFOM development programs for&#13;
infrastructure and community works in periurban poverty zones are another. There is&#13;
also an expanding body of evidence elsewhere on the advantages of decentralized rural&#13;
development solutions, several of which are being supported by the World Bank in&#13;
Latin America, for example, in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. (See paragraphs&#13;
4.6 through 4.7 on lessons from experience).&#13;
2.10  Legal Framework. The foundation for local government action in local&#13;
economic development has until now been the Municipal Law of 1988 (Ley de&#13;
Municipios - Ley No. 40). This law authorizes local government to provide services&#13;
and exercise administrative authority over: (i) environmental protection; (ii) regulation&#13;
of urban development and land use; (iii) solid waste management; (iv) reforestation;&#13;
(v) oversight of natural resource use and protection; and (vi) creation of mechanisms&#13;
for popular participation in local decision-making. Several larger and/or better funded&#13;
Municipal governments (e.g., Le6n, Chinandega, El Castillo) have begun to exercise&#13;
these powers through the establishment of municipal environmental offices, employing&#13;
technical specialists, and the creation of environmental and natural resource advisory&#13;
committees. In a number of foreign donor-assisted projects as well, municipal&#13;
governments are beginning to function in their expanded roles.&#13;
2.11  Constitutional Reform. The 1995 Constitutional Reform (Reforma Parcial&#13;
de la Constituci6n) had important implications for local government. Key aspects of&#13;
the constitutional reform include: (i) regions were eliminated as administrative units&#13;
with the exception of the RAAS and RAAN; (ii) municipal governments were given&#13;
broad responsibilities over socioeconornic (rural and urban) development within&#13;
municipalities; (iii) municipal governments must now be consulted regarding natural&#13;
resource use contracts in their jurisdictions; (iv) mayor, vice-mayor and councilors&#13;
will all be elected directly for a period of four years; and (v) a percentage of the&#13;
national budget will be transferred to those municipalities with lower resource&#13;
mobilization potential. Following this reform of the Constitution, a new&#13;
Municipalities Law currently being discussed by the National Assembly would, inter&#13;
alia: regulate the election process; more clearly define competencies between&#13;
municipal and central government; comrnit the GON to transfer a percentage of&#13;
national public revenues to local governments according to pre-established formulas.&#13;
IDA has maintained an active dialogue with the GON on the decentralization process&#13;
in the context of the Institutional Development Credit (No. 2690-NI) and the&#13;
preparation activities for the proposed Rural Municipalities Project. IDA has also&#13;
financed technical assistance on decentralization and local public finance issues (see list&#13;
of reports in project file in Annex 13).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2.12   Fiscal Transfers3. The constitutional reform described above creates&#13;
conditions under which the proposed project could be sustained, by guaranteeing&#13;
disadvantaged municipalities a financial base on which to build their planning and&#13;
implementation capacity. Fiscal transfers from central government to municipalities are&#13;
currently insignificant (3% of total municipality revenues in 1994), and in their absence&#13;
disadvantaged municipalities rely on programs of line agencies or specialized&#13;
institutions such as the Nicaraguan Social Investment Fund (EISE), over which they&#13;
have little control. In 1994, 74% of all municipal finance originated from taxes and&#13;
fees, with the bulk coming from sales taxes and business registration fees. These taxes&#13;
are predominantly collected in trading centers where businesses are located, usually&#13;
cities and towns, which capture a disproportionate share of the country's local&#13;
revenues. As a result of this bias, the fourteen more urbanized municipalities in the&#13;
country, including 49 percent of the population, account for 75 percent of all&#13;
municipal expenditures. The municipality of Managua alone, which has 24% of the&#13;
Nicaraguan population, accounts for 42% of all municipal expenditures. While urban&#13;
municipalities such as Le6n and Chinandega invest more than US$4.00 per capita per&#13;
year and have total expenditures of more than US$20.00 per capita per year, the more&#13;
rural ones invest less than US$0.50 per capita per year and have total expenditures of&#13;
less than US$2.00 per capita per year.&#13;
2.13   Central Government Coordination of Municipal Affairs. The key&#13;
institution in charge of municipal issues at the central government level is the&#13;
Nicaraguan Institute for Municipal Development (INIFOM). INIFOM is a financially&#13;
autonomous institution created by Decree No. 497 of March 2, 1990. It has clear&#13;
objectives: to strengthen municipal govermment and to promote municipal&#13;
development. Accordingly, INIFOM provides training and technical assistance to&#13;
municipal govemments; is in charge of inter-institutional coordination between&#13;
municipalities and central government agencies; carries out studies and research&#13;
related to municipal issues; and channels centrally financed projects to municipalities.&#13;
INIFOM is also the key institution coordinating the decentralization strategy of the&#13;
govemment, the President of INIFOM being Chairman of the GON Sectoral&#13;
Decentralization Commission (SDC). IN1FOM is an unique institution in Latin&#13;
America. Its President has the rank of Minister and sits in cabinet meetings, but is&#13;
chosen by and responds to a Board of Directors composed of 32 people, six chosen by&#13;
the GON and the other 26 being elected mayors representing municipal governments.&#13;
INIFOM is therefore an agency both of the GON and of the local governments and is&#13;
the defacto representative of local governments at the cabinet level. This is&#13;
INIFOM's main strength. A recent report done for IDA's Institutional Development&#13;
3  Details on municipal financing are in the background papers in the project file: (15) Hacienda&#13;
Municipal y Decentralizacion"; (3) Capacidad lnstitucional de las Municipalidades"; (26)&#13;
"A signaci6n y Recursos para Inversi6n Municipal"; and (44) Estudio de Diagnostico&#13;
Institucional y Reestructuraci6n - INIFOM, Municipalidades".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
Credit4, which is supporting the strengthening of 1NIFOM, identified a series of&#13;
weaknesses related to administrative functions and to the capacity to assist municipal&#13;
governments, which are summarized in Annex 1 and which would be addressed by the&#13;
Institutional Development Credit (Credit No. 2690-NI) cofinanced by the World Bank&#13;
and DANIDA, and by the proposed project.&#13;
E. LOCAL CAPACITY&#13;
2.14   Rural Development and Natural Resources. Municipal governments are&#13;
being given ever increasing roles in economic activity, but for the most part have&#13;
serious limitations in their ability in assuming those roles. In the proposed project&#13;
regions, with several notable exceptions (e.g., Le6n, Chinandega) municipal&#13;
governments do not have the technical capacity for rural development and natural&#13;
resource planning and management. During project preparation a typology of&#13;
municipalities was developed (Annex 1), based on the relationship between municipal&#13;
capacity and revenues. Within the 32 project municipalities already selected for the&#13;
proposed project, the capacity to assume increased responsibility over poverty, natural&#13;
resource management and economic development ranges from "extremely limited" to&#13;
"limited". Le6n is the only exception. And it is the only municipality with a&#13;
medium-term, strategic development plan and with the administrative, managerial and&#13;
technical capacity to implement it. After Le6n, the municipality of Chinandega is the&#13;
most capable in terms of technical/administrative resources and financial status. The&#13;
other municipal governments are generally weak financially, administratively and&#13;
technically. Not unexpectedly, a negative correlation exists between the degree (and&#13;
costs) of on-going environmental degradation and municipal government capacity.&#13;
The smallest and poorest municipalities often are located in the more sensitive zones&#13;
(e.g. near remaining forests, in upper watersheds, in coastal zones, etc). While these&#13;
municipalities would tend to be of higher priority in the proposed project, they would&#13;
also be the municipalities with the least capacity to assume responsibility for planning&#13;
and managing the kind of investment envisaged under the project.&#13;
2.15  Financial Management. Adequate experience of financial management is only&#13;
present in those municipalities which have been able to raise and manage substantial&#13;
local revenues of their own. During preparation, an evaluation was carried out of the&#13;
financial control systems in 32 municipalities proposed for the project. In each&#13;
municipality procedures, staff qualifications, and practices were evaluated against the&#13;
Bank's norms and guidelines contained in the Financial Accounting, Reporting and&#13;
Auditing Handbook (FARAH). Of the 32 municipalities in the proposed project only&#13;
Le6n and Chinandega met the FARAH criteria. The study was used to develop an&#13;
indicator of financial management standards which is presented in Annex 1, Table&#13;
Al.4 and Annex 10, Figure AlO. 1. The study also proposed an action plan, to be&#13;

project file, see Annex 13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
supported by the project, to bring financial controls up tc Bank standards5. All project&#13;
municipalities do have at least rudimentary financial accounting and control systems.&#13;
About 70% of project municipalities have their defined organizational structure&#13;
completely staffed. Some 40% of them have manuals of municipal government&#13;
functions and 30% have terms-of-reference and manuals of procedures for municipal&#13;
employees. All but one municipality maintains a set of books which are current, and&#13;
the majority (80%) have contracted external, independent audits within the last three&#13;
years.&#13;
2.16 Non-Government Organizations (NGOs). Supported by numerous donor&#13;
programs, NGOs have assumed a key role as implementing agencies at the local level.&#13;
The term NGO, as used in Nicaragua, refers to a wide range of organizations - public&#13;
garden user groups, women's groups, farmers' cooperatives, religious groups,&#13;
environmental advocacy groups, and donor focused organizations. The NGO&#13;
movement has developed mainly where government is weakest, in particular in social,&#13;
rural development and environmental activities, with most growth occurring between&#13;
1990 and 1992. Today, there are more than 300 NGOs in Nicaragua. Most are&#13;
legally established. Most traditional NGOs have their own revenues from either&#13;
government transfers, membership fees, charges for services or international funding.&#13;
Some, more recently, have tended to rely on voluntary contributions and voluntary&#13;
work. NGOs dependent on international funding tend to be fairly well equipped, while&#13;
local ones are usually very weak. Nevertheless, collectively, the NGOs have assumed&#13;
an important role in the rural landscape and have acquired a high visibility (see Annex&#13;
1 for more details on NGOs).&#13;
2.17  Community Organizations. There is a wide variety of participatory systems&#13;
in Nicaragua, reflecting the recent history of the country, the political inclinations of&#13;
local government and the influence of donor programs. The most basic unit for&#13;
community participation in non-indigenous areas is the comarca, a non-administrative&#13;
geographical unit with roughly 500 people. On average, there are 50 comarcas per&#13;
municipality. In most comarcas there is an informal community assembly, the most&#13;
important community decision structure. In some municipalities comarcas elect a&#13;
community member to represent them at the municipal level or in inter-community&#13;
assemblies. By law some of the municipal council meetings, and in particular those&#13;
involving key budgetary decisions, are open to all the inhabitants of the municipality.&#13;
Municipal councils also hold extended meetings where community representatives are&#13;
invited to participate. The indigenous conmmunities in the project area (the Sutiabas in&#13;
the Pacific and several groups in the Atlantic) maintain most of their traditional&#13;
decision-making structures, but also participate in the non-indigenous structures where&#13;
these are operational. A constraint to decentralization beyond the municipal level is&#13;
the cumbersome process needed for communities or groups of individuals to achieve a&#13;
legal status, which requires approval by the National Assembly. This constraint would&#13;
be addressed by the proposed project.&#13;

F. BANK GROUP LENDING IN NICARAGUA&#13;
2.18 Cumulative Bank/IDA lending as of end-June 1996 totaled US$ 702 million for&#13;
28 Loans, 19 Credits, and 4 Supplementary IDA Reflow Credits. Of these, 28 Loans&#13;
and 10 Credits were approved and fully disbursed by FY80, and 9 Credits and the 4&#13;
Supplementary Credits were approved during FY92-96. There have been three IFC&#13;
operations that have been fully disbursed. The Board approved credits to support: an&#13;
Economic Recovery Credit in FY92, a First Social Investment Fund in FY93, an&#13;
Agricultural Technology and Land Management Project and a Health Sector Reform&#13;
Project in FY94; an Education Project and an Institutional Development Credit in&#13;
FY95 and a Second Social Investment Fund, a Second Economic Recovery Credit and&#13;
a Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project in FY96. Due to the break in project&#13;
implementation in Nicaragua during the 1980s, there is relatively little recent&#13;
experience from which to draw lessons on design or implementation. As far as can be&#13;
judged to date, however, the experience has been generally good. As of December&#13;
1995 there were no problem projects in Nicaragua and four out of seven projects were&#13;
rated highly satisfactory. The only project in the rural sector, the Agriculture&#13;
Technology and Land Management Project, is rated highly satisfactory.&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTWES&#13;
3.1   The main objectives of the proposed project are to reduce rural poverty and to&#13;
improve natural resources management. These objectives can be narrowed down&#13;
more specifically to the following:&#13;
*  To establish a mechanism based on municipal governments and community&#13;
organizations for reducing rural poverty through rural investment in&#13;
economic infrastructure, improved natural resource management and&#13;
small-scale communal productive activities.&#13;
*  To ensure that central government institutions acquire the capacity to&#13;
provide a coherent overall framework for natural resource policy making&#13;
and enforcement, accounting for global, national and regional&#13;
environmental priorities.&#13;
*  To promote the long-term integrity of a biological corridor along the&#13;
Atlantic slope of Nicaragua, conserving key global biodiversity values.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
B. PROJECT SUMMARY DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2   To meet these objectives, the project would have three components:&#13;

aspects of natural resources and rural water subprojects; (iv)&#13;
methodologies for technology transfer; and (v) subproject and fund&#13;
administration.&#13;
*  Establishing and monitoring a registry of service providers at the municipal&#13;
level.&#13;
Grants for Community and Municipality Subprojects (US$ 23.4 million)&#13;
3.6    Activities. The project would finance small grants for eligible subprojects&#13;
proposed for financing by groups of beneficiaries, legal representatives of rural&#13;
communities, municipalities and groups of municipalities in the Pacific and Atlantic&#13;
regions and approved by municipalities within a municipal financing ceiling (see para.&#13;
6.16) through a demand driven and participatory decision-making mechanism covering&#13;
the following thematic areas:&#13;
*  Environment and natural resources, including investments in the control of&#13;
spill-over effects of soil erosion, protection of water sources, control of&#13;
wind-erosion, natural reserve protection, wetlands and mangrove&#13;
protection and management, riparian management, control of agro-&#13;
chemical pollution and control of water contamination.&#13;

community water supply, small processing, warehouses and distribution&#13;
infrastructure and equipment, community roads and other subprojects to be&#13;
maintained and operated by groups or communities of the rural poor.&#13;
*  Community productive subprojects for the rural poor, including collective&#13;
soil and moisture conservation, reforestation, farm forestry, subsistence&#13;
agriculture inputs, subsistence livestock inputs, wildlife farming,&#13;
ecotourism, subsistence fishing inputs and micro-enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Capacity building, including technical and legal assistance, training,&#13;
education, extension and applied research on all the above subproject&#13;
categories, on operation, maintenance and cost-recovery aspects; orn other&#13;
aspects of municipal and community management; and on the elaboration&#13;
of community land demarcation proposals.&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCES POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS COMPONENT&#13;
Institutional Development of MARENA (US$3.0 million)&#13;
3.7    Activities. The project would finance minor equipment, consultants, studies,&#13;
training, seminars and workshops, study tours and other training expenses and&#13;
incremental salaries and other recurrent costs for:&#13;
*  Establishment of a Project Implementation Unit in MARENA including an&#13;
implementation coordinator, an indigenous peoples specialist, a&#13;
procurement specialist and a disbursements specialist.&#13;
*  Strengthening the Directorate of Planning, Division of Policy and Planning,&#13;
the Division of Inter-institutional Relations, the Division of Protected&#13;
Areas and the regional delegations in project areas.&#13;
* Preparation and dissemination of municipal and regional environmental and&#13;
land use plans (ELUP) and a system for monitoring threats to natural&#13;
resources and compliance with the plans with full involvement of regional&#13;
and local governments and consultations and participation of indigenous&#13;
and non-indigenous communities.'&#13;
* Preparation, consultations, participation and dissemination related to&#13;
legislative proposals, regulations and studies covering the following&#13;
themes: (i) regulation of the General Environmental Law; (ii) proposal and&#13;
regulation of a Protected Area and/or Biodiversity Law; (iii) proposal and&#13;
regulation of a Forestry Law; (iv) contributions to the proposal and&#13;
regulation of a Fishery Law; (v) initiatives for the harmonization of&#13;
decentralization, natural resources and indigenous peoples legislation; (vi)&#13;
analysis of relations between rural poverty and environmental degradation&#13;
and other unidentified studies as approved by IDA.&#13;
7   The General Environmental Law of March 1996 assigns to MARENA and INETER the role of&#13;
issuing norms covering these plans and to municipal governments the role of elaborating and&#13;
executing them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Inter-institutional Assistance Program (US$2.1 million)&#13;
3.8    Activities. The project would finance training, workshops, study tours,&#13;
technical assistance and minor equipment for inter-institutional assistance to be&#13;
provided by the Division of Inter-institutional Relations of MARENA to other&#13;
agencies: (i) the National Assembly, in reviewing legislative proposals related to&#13;
natural resources and environment; (ii) the Judiciary, by preparing trainers, curricula&#13;
and training materials, and training of about sixty Supreme Court and other judges in&#13;
environmental matters; (iii) the Office of the Attorney General, through the&#13;
establishment of an Environmental Affairs Unit (created by the General Environmental&#13;
Law of 1996); (iv) police environmental units, by preparing trainers, curricula and&#13;
training materials on control of illegal logging, wildlife trade and contamination from&#13;
mining and other industries; (v) army environmental units, by preparing trainers,&#13;
curricula and training materials on monitoring of turtle landings in the Pacific, control&#13;
of forest fires and monitoring of resource degradation and of protected areas; (vi) legal&#13;
offices of central government agencies, through training and technical assistance in&#13;
environmental and natural resources legislation and regulation; and (vii) thirty-two&#13;
municipal governments, by preparing trainers, curricula and training materials,&#13;
providing training in the role and responsibilities of municipalities in natural resource&#13;
and environmental management, including local natural resource taxation and&#13;
elaboration, use and monitoring of environment and land use plans. A detailed&#13;
workplan for this program is in the Project Implementation Plan in the project files.&#13;
ATLANTIC BIODIVERSITY CORRIDOR COMPONENr (GEF)8&#13;
3.9    During final preparation of this component a detailed environment and land use&#13;
plan for the Atlantic region of Nicaragua will be finalized including a delineation of the&#13;
biodiversity corridor and a proposal for the strategic use of resources in the Atlantic&#13;
including protected areas, buffer zones, forest reserves, indigenous traditional&#13;
territories and areas for economic development activities. This environment and land&#13;
use plan referred to in this document as the ABC strategy would be the basis for&#13;
defining kinds of subprojects to be promoted or excluded and source of financing,&#13;
either the grants included under the rural municipalities development component or the&#13;
grants included under the financing mechanism for the sustainability of the corridor&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
8   Although conceptually part of the same project, the GEF component would be managed as a&#13;
separate operation, with different timing, project documentation, legal agreements and&#13;
supervision reports. The GEF component is still under preparation, is expected to be submitted&#13;
for Board approval in FY98, and, if approved, implementation would start with phase 3 of the&#13;
IDA components. The component description presented here is preliminary and could be&#13;
changed during further preparation of the component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
Involvement of Local Communities, Indigenous Groups, NGOs and&#13;
Governments in Biodiversity Management&#13;
3.10  Activities. The project would finance consultants and training for: (i)&#13;
disseminating information on project activities among indigenous and non-indigenous&#13;
communities in the Atlantic region and involving them in project implementation; (ii)&#13;
training indigenous and non-indigenous communities in sustainable biodiversity use&#13;
and protection; (iii) assisting indigenous communities in pursuing formal recognition&#13;
for their land and natural resources rights; (iv) training and technical assistance to&#13;
municipal and regional governments for the implementation of the ABC strategy; and&#13;
(v) training of central government agencies on the ABC strategy.&#13;
Biodiversity Planning, Information, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
3.11  Activities. The project would finance equipment, consultants, studies,&#13;
workshops, training and dissemination materials, travel expenses and incremental&#13;
salaries and other recurrent costs for (i) continued land use planning within the ABC;&#13;
(ii) implementing a biodiversity monitoring system in coordination with communities&#13;
and local and regional governments to warn of threats to biodiversity; and (iii)&#13;
establishing a system for evaluating potential impacts on the ABC of development&#13;
activities (such as roads and other infrastructure and logging, mining and fishing&#13;
concessions) and for proposing and enforcing mitigating measures.&#13;
Subprojects for Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use9&#13;
3.12  Activities. The project would finance (i) equipment, consultants, training,&#13;
workshops, seminars, studies and study tours for the establishment and operating costs&#13;
of a financial mechanism to promote the long-term sustainability of the ABC and&#13;
ensure coordination between the programs supported by different agencies; and (ii)&#13;
grants for sub-projects covering the following themes:&#13;
*  Management of protected areas, including protection investments,&#13;
management plans and recurrent costs related to the maintenance of the&#13;
protected areas of Bosawas, Cayos Miskitos, Indio-Maiz, Cerro Silva and&#13;
Wawashan.&#13;
*  Subprojects of sustainable use of biodiversity submitted by indigenous and&#13;
non-indigenous communities, municipalities, NGOs and the private sector&#13;
for areas included in the ABC in a way similar to the matching grants&#13;
described under the Rural Municipalities Component. Matching grants&#13;
would only finance subprojects that have a clear positive impact on&#13;
biodiversity and the integrity of the ABC, including training and technical&#13;
assistance for communities in biodiversity protection and sustainable uses,&#13;
9  The nature of the financing mechanism will be defined during preparation of this component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
demarcation of key areas, biodiversity monitoring and inventories, vigilance&#13;
systems, environmental education, ecotourism, sustainable uses of&#13;
biodiversity, etc. These subprojects could be financed as quid pro quo&#13;
agreements, whereby the recipient commits to sustainable resource use and&#13;
conservation practices in exchange for support for their development&#13;
needs. More traditional community development projects not specifically&#13;
tied to biodiversity would be eligible for financing under the Rural&#13;
Municipalities Component.&#13;
Subprojects, submitted by indigenous communities, for demarcation of&#13;
indigenous lands or territories which include biologically important&#13;
habitats.&#13;
4. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFICIARIES AND PARTICIPATION&#13;
4.1   Beneficiaries. The main project beneficiaries are communities of rural poor&#13;
within municipalities of the Western (Le6n and Chinandega) and Atlantic regions,&#13;
including indigenous communities, who would receive grants for community&#13;
development projects prioritized by them. Through the project these conmmunities&#13;
would be able to play a more important role in planning and investment decisions at&#13;
the level of municipal governments. Other beneficiaries would include municipal&#13;
governments which would receive technical assistance to run municipal affairs and&#13;
which would approve and finance subprojects prioritized by communities, and NGOs&#13;
and local private sector service providers, which would receive training and assist&#13;
communities and local governments with the design and implementation of&#13;
subprojects. Government institutions would benefit from technical assistance to&#13;
strengthen their normative role in decentralization and natural resources. The entire&#13;
Nicaraguan society would benefit from improved management of natural resources.&#13;
Finally the world would benefit from biodiversity conservation in the Atlantic slope of&#13;
Nicaragua.&#13;
4.2   Participation. Project design included a large number of participatory events&#13;
involving local communities, local governments, NGOs and central government&#13;
agencies. One key objective of the project is to strengthen participatory mechanisms&#13;
at the level of local governments to increase the ability of the rural poor to voice their&#13;
demands and of local governments to meet them. Project preparation included and&#13;
implementation would include the following categories of activities to foster&#13;
participation:&#13;
* Information Sharing: seven workshops and many meetings took place&#13;
during preparation in the Departments of Le6n and Chinandega in the&#13;
Pacific region and of San Carlos, Bluefields and Nueva Guinea in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Atlantic region. More than 94 different organizations, including 32&#13;
municipal governments and more than 50 NGOs, participated. During&#13;
implementation the project would continue to be widely disseminated&#13;
among eligible beneficiaries using appropriate technologies (paragraphs&#13;
3.5 and 3.10).&#13;
*  Consultation: a process of consultations with beneficiaries has been going&#13;
on since project identification, regarding project design, investment&#13;
priorities and local decision-making mechanisms. Social Assessments that&#13;
included rapid rural appraisal of target populations (indigenous and non-&#13;
indigenous) were carried out as part of preparation for the proposed&#13;
project. An Indigenous Peoples Development Plan for the communities of&#13;
the Atlantic region is well advanced as part of the preparation for the&#13;
Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor Component (GEF). The results of the&#13;
Social Assessment are summarized in Annex 3, and the Indigenous&#13;
Peoples Strategy to be supported by the project is summarized in Annex 5.&#13;
On-going consultations with beneficiaries to monitor the extent to which&#13;
the project is reaching them have been programmed during&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3  Participation in implementation is one key project objective that focuses&#13;
on strengthening local decision-making structures: the Intercommunity&#13;
Assembly made up of representatives of comarcas and indigenous&#13;
communities within a municipality; and the Community Supervision&#13;
Committee to increase the local accountability of municipal governments.&#13;
Furthermore, technical assistance to GON agencies will include&#13;
strengthening the process of local participation and consultations&#13;
regarding policy matters and the Project Implementation Unit in INIFOM&#13;
and MARENA, the Division of Interinstitutional Relations of MARENA&#13;
and the Municipal Technical Units would include participation specialists.&#13;
*  Ownership will be promoted because most local investments will be&#13;
chosen, implemented and operated by the beneficiaries themselves.&#13;
B. GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE&#13;
4.3   The project would concentrate on the Western Region (90% of local&#13;
investments) and the Atlantic Region (10% of local investments). First, these were&#13;
the two priority regions identified by CONAGRO and they are also priority regions in&#13;
the National Environmental Action Plan. Second, Leon and Chinandega is a region of&#13;
high population density, unemployment and poverty, and also the region with the&#13;
highest agricultural potentiallo. Thus, the project is likely to have a large social impact&#13;

22&#13;
in the region. Third, in Le6n and Chinandega there is a relatively well-developed&#13;
local administrative capacity, NGOs and legally established community structures&#13;
(associations, cooperatives, etc.)"'. Moreover GON views this project as a pilot for&#13;
the proposed fiscal transfers to disadvantaged municipalities contemplated in the 1995&#13;
Constitution. Those fiscal transfers (block grants) would, if and when the new&#13;
Municipalities Law is enacted, benefit the 141 municipalities in the country and it is&#13;
important for GON to develop a working model of decentralized decision-making&#13;
mechanisms in a smaller number of municipalities to be later extended to the rest of the&#13;
country. Local governments and communities are much weaker in the Segovias and&#13;
Northern regions, where most of the extremely poor are located, and those regions&#13;
would not serve well for a model to be replicated. Fourth, in Segovias and Northern&#13;
regions there are already other donor projects, including two large IDB projects&#13;
focused on rural poverty and development (the PNDR and the recently-approved&#13;
Watershed Management Project). Finally, the project also extends to the Atlantic&#13;
because of the richness of its biological heritage, and the need to include Atlantic&#13;
municipalities in the capacity building and decentralization process, while at the same&#13;
time securing the conservation of critical global biodiversity values.&#13;
C. COMPLEMENTARITY BETWEEN THE IDA AND GEF COMPONENTS&#13;
4.4    The two IDA components, rural municipalities development and natural&#13;
resources policies and institutions, and the GEF component, Atlantic Biodiversity&#13;
Corridor, are all critical for achieving the project's interdependent objectives of&#13;
reducing rural poverty and improving natural resources management, including&#13;
conservation of biodiversity in the Atlantic.&#13;
F First the project would focus institutionally on strengthening the capacity&#13;
of rural municipal governments and communities to identify, design,&#13;
approve and manage eligible investments. In light of the current process&#13;
of reform of the state supported by IDA's Institutional Development&#13;
Credit (Credit No. 2690-NI) which is helping increase the quality and&#13;
efficiency of public services through restructuring and rationalization of&#13;
central government institutions and improve the financial and personnel&#13;
management systems, the use of decentralized mechanisms for channeling&#13;
local investments is necessary. This strategy is also consistent with the&#13;
Bank's experience elsewhere with rural poverty projects and with the&#13;
expanding the role of local government in the Nicaraguan economy.&#13;
However decentralization needs to be accompanied by the strengthening&#13;
of the normative and enforcement role of central governrment over natural&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
resources and the environment. The natural resources sectors are plagued&#13;
by environmental externalities that spill over the boundaries of local&#13;
jurisdictions and local institutions are not suited for dealing with them. A&#13;
clear policy and institutional framework needs to be put in place to&#13;
minimize these environmental risks.&#13;
*  Second the IDA components would contribute to the Atlantic Biodiversity&#13;
Corridor: (i) channeling rural development investments and agricultural&#13;
intensification to the heavily populated Pacific region, thereby reducing the&#13;
causes leading to out-migration and expansion of the agricultural frontier&#13;
into the lowly populated Atlantic region; (ii) preparing critical legislation&#13;
on natural resource use and environment and supporting the enforcement&#13;
of existing and new legislation when enacted; (iii) through legislative&#13;
proposals, legal analyses and studies proposing and helping clarify&#13;
responsibilities over natural resource management between GON and&#13;
autonomous governments and indigenous communities of the Atlantic&#13;
region; (iv) strengthening the protected area system (SINAP) and the&#13;
institutional capacity of the Division of Protected Areas of MARENA,&#13;
charged with its management; and (v) training and strengthening Atlantic&#13;
municipal governments in environmental planning and monitoring and in&#13;
providing services to indigenous communities and increasing community&#13;
participation.&#13;
*  Third the GEF supported activities would complement the IDA&#13;
components by: (i) identifying priority areas for conservation and&#13;
sustainable use in the Atlantic to guide local public spending (the ABC&#13;
strategy); (ii) establishing sustainable mechanisms, including for&#13;
biodiversity protection, biodiversity monitoring and biodiversity impact&#13;
assessment procedures to ensure that local investment decisions&#13;
adequately internalize global biodiversity concerns related to the ABC;&#13;
(iii) financing local projects in the ABC related to global biodiversity&#13;
benefits; (iv) training local governments and indigenous and non-&#13;
indigenous communities in methodologies and technologies consistent&#13;
with the overall objective of improved natural resource management&#13;
including biodiversity conservation; and (v) as part of the Indigenous&#13;
Peoples Development Plan developing the legislative framework for&#13;
effective application of the indigenous peoples constitutional rights.&#13;
D. LESSONS FROM PAST BANK LENDING&#13;
4.5    Beneficiary Participation. There is considerable accumulated experience in&#13;
the LAC region on demand-driven development activities, which would be the basis&#13;
for the proposed project. A recent Bank review on this type of project in Latin&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
America'2 reported that: (i) by encouraging the active involvement of community&#13;
groups, such projects are much more likely to meet the community's needs than if they&#13;
are chosen to reflect the priorities of a government agency; (ii) once the communities&#13;
develop a sense of ownership of a project, they are willing to share in its costs and to&#13;
ensure its maintenance; and (iii) once a community group is given responsibility for&#13;
implementing a project that it has helped to design, it shows a great interest in&#13;
ensuring that the private contractor executing the project does so well and honestly.&#13;
4.6    Rural Decentralization. Experience of decentralized rural development&#13;
initiatives in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico has been positive. A recent&#13;
dissemination note"3 lists the following positive features: (i) local governments have&#13;
proven to be effective in identifying and implementing micro-projects; (ii)&#13;
decentralization has improved the response time of local governments to community&#13;
needs; (iii) local government action has improved transparency and accountability; (iv)&#13;
local governments have often been more effective in targeting the poor by involving&#13;
communities in project selection; and (v) in some cases, local governments have been&#13;
effective in raising local revenue. (See Section 7E for a discussion of risks of&#13;
decentralization and Section 7C for a discussion of costs and benefits of&#13;
decentralization).&#13;
4.7    A study that reviewed the rules governing three Demand-driven Rural&#13;
Investment Funds'4 is under completion by LATAD"5. It compares three projects&#13;
implemented long enough to have a track record--Colombia's Fondo DRI, Brazil's&#13;
PAC/FUMAC, and Mexico's Solidaridad programs--and explores the extent to which&#13;
a carefully-devised rule and incentive structure can replace central control and&#13;
centrally-imposed constraints, while assuring that "caudillismo" and "clientelismo"&#13;
will not become ascendant. The study demonstrates the wide range of possible&#13;
solutions that can be designed to foster accountability and efficiency, and highlights&#13;
the need for flexible rules that are grounded in the realities of local circumstances and&#13;
can be redesigned based on local experience. Specifically, the lessons learned from the&#13;
comparative analysis of these projects are: (i) A gradual process of increasing&#13;
decentralization allows individual municipalities to take control of the various aspects&#13;
of rural development, enhancing community participation. (ii) Targeting mechanisms&#13;

should be carefully designed both among and within municipalities. For example, the&#13;
differentiation of cofinancing requirements according to the income level of&#13;
municipalities--requiring a lower cofinancing from poorer municipalities--helps&#13;
improving poverty targeting. (iii) The enforcement of a complex set of rules is&#13;
essential but problematic. Therefore, particular emphasis should be given to&#13;
dissemination, monitoring, and enforcement. These lessons were incorporated in the&#13;
design of the proposed project.&#13;
4.8   Biodiversity Protection. The design and preparation of the proposed project&#13;
has drawn on lessons derived from World Bank experience in implementing&#13;
biodiversity projects. World Bank support to parks and protected areas has grown&#13;
rapidly over the last five years. The Bank's IBRD/IDA portfolio of biodiversity related&#13;
activities for FY92-95 includes some 27 projects with a total loan/credit value of US$&#13;
287 million. In addition, the Bank has implemented 31 GEF biodiversity projects&#13;
worldwide, for which the GEF participants have allocated $244 million between FY&#13;
92-95. A recent World Bank report, Mainstreaming Biodiversity in Development: a&#13;
World Bank Assistance Strategyfor Implementing the Convention on Biologzcal&#13;
Diversity, highlights some of the key factors contributing to successful project&#13;
implementation. These include: institutional strengthening, participation of local&#13;
stakeholders, financial sustainability, flexible and iterative processes, and decentralized&#13;
management of protected areas.&#13;
4.9   To date there have been no GEF projects in Nicaragua, but experiences of&#13;
bilateral financed projects in the Atlantic region, by DANIDA and the Netherlands in&#13;
the South Atlantic and GTZ and USAID in Bosawas in the North Atlantic, confirm&#13;
these lessons. These projects have found that small farmer training for the adoption of&#13;
appropriate technologies is the single most cost efficient intervention for&#13;
environmental protection in the region. They also found that assistance to indigenous&#13;
communities for the recognition of their lands and natural resources rights are an&#13;
essential condition for project success where indigenous communities are present.&#13;
Other highly successful activities include community development activities, such as&#13;
schools, which help to stabilize migrant populations, support for land titling for small&#13;
farmers, support on environmental matters to local govemments and to regionally&#13;
based representatives of the central govemment, and support to inter-institutional and&#13;
NGO coordinating mechanisms. The proposed project includes components and&#13;
measures that attempt to incorporate these lessons learned.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR IDA AND GEF INVOLVEMENT&#13;
4.10 Consistency with CAS. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for&#13;
Nicaragua, presented to the Board on May 27, 1994 (Report No. P-6340-NI), has the&#13;
following four key objectives: (i) reviving growth; (ii) reforming the public sector and&#13;
strengthening institutional capacity; (iii) improving environmental and natural resource&#13;
management; and (iv) alleviating poverty and investing in human capital. The&#13;
proposed project is consistent with these four objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
*  First, it would help foster economic growth by providing for public and&#13;
private investment in rural areas, targeting investments towards the&#13;
country's most productive agricultural region and the most heavily&#13;
populated.&#13;
*  Second, it would assist in the reform of public sector institutions involved&#13;
in natural resource management, strengthen municipal governments and&#13;
emphasize decentralization of investment decisions and project&#13;
implementation. GON views the local decision-making mechanism to be&#13;
supported by the project as a pilot to be replicated in other municipalities&#13;
with the implementation of the fiscal transfers mechanism for&#13;
disadvantaged municipalities included in the Partial Reform of the&#13;
Constitution of June 1995 and in the proposed Municipalities Law in the&#13;
National Assembly.&#13;
*  Third, it would improve environmental and natural resource management&#13;
through assistance for policy reform and specific subproject investments.&#13;
The associated GEF component, in particular, would support conservation&#13;
and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Atlantic Corridor.&#13;
*  Finally, it would assist in alleviating rural poverty and in improving the&#13;
skills of rural people and of local institutions that serve them. The project&#13;
would also meet a number of specific recommendations for the rural&#13;
sector of the recent Poverty Assessment for Nicaragua (Report No.&#13;
14038-NI), specifically: (i) strengthening sector implementation capacity&#13;
at the national and local levels; (ii) promoting agricultural growth by&#13;
removing information, marketing and infrastructure constraints; and (iii)&#13;
strengthening agricultural research, training and extension services.&#13;
4.11   Consistency with GEF Strategies. The proposed GEF component is&#13;
consistent with the guidance from the First and Second Conferences of the Parties&#13;
(COP I and COP2) as it would: address in situ conservation; include capacity&#13;
building; strengthen conservation, management, and sustainable use of ecosystems and&#13;
habitats, including coastal and marine ecosystems and mountain regions; strengthen&#13;
the involvement of local and indigenous peoples; and integrate social dimensions,&#13;
including those related to poverty. The proposed GEF component would also be&#13;
responsive to the objectives stated for the GEF Operational Program targeted to forest&#13;
ecosystems (operational program 2) and is part of a specific GEF sub-program&#13;
focused on Meso America that aims to protect a biological corridor from Mexico to&#13;
Colombia. Related projects are currently under preparation in Honduras and Panama.&#13;
4.12  Consistency with Other IDA Operations. The project would complement&#13;
four on-going IDA operations that support development of the rural sector, namely: (i)&#13;
the Institutional Development Credit (Credit No. 2690-NI), (ii) the First and (iii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
Second Social Investment Funds (FISE) (Credits No. 2934-NI and 2767-NI); and (iv)&#13;
the Agricultural Technology and Land Management Project (Credit No. 2536-NI).&#13;
*  The Institutional Development Credit (Credit 2690-NI) focuses on&#13;
supporting CERAP (Executive Committee for the Reform of the Public&#13;
Sector) and streamlining and improving management of GON agencies&#13;
through organizational reform, reduction of superfluous personnel and&#13;
programs and strengthening of management functions. Both MARENA&#13;
and INIFOM are included in the group of first six institutions to be&#13;
reformed and have recently negotiated Institutional Reform Agreements&#13;
(IRA) that would lay the ground rules for these institutions to receive&#13;
financial assistance. The proposed project would complement this Credit&#13;
by focusing on strengthening the technical functions of those institutions,&#13;
which are not covered by the IRAs, and by advancing the decentralization&#13;
process, which is one of CERAP's objectives.&#13;
*  The FISE, which is supported by both IDA (FISE I, Credit No. 2434-NI,&#13;
and FISE II, Credit No. 2767-NI), the IDB and other donors, started in&#13;
1993, and so far a high proportion (52 percent) of its investments has&#13;
covered social infrastructure (schools, health clinics, etc.), and only 0.2&#13;
percent has been directed towards the environment. The proposed project&#13;
would be highly complementary, in that it would focus on technical&#13;
assistance, natural resources and the environment, productive activities&#13;
and economic infrastructure in poor rural communities and it would place&#13;
special emphasis on strengthening local institutions -- municipal&#13;
governments, NGOs and communities. In the long-term, this process&#13;
should help provide a sustainable alternative to the FISE for channeling&#13;
local investments.&#13;
*  The Agricultural Technology and Land Management Project (Credit No.&#13;
2536-NI) focuses on agricultural research, extension and land titling on a&#13;
national scale for both small farmers and indigenous communities. The&#13;
land titling activities for small farmers are critical for the success of the&#13;
proposed project because more secure property rights would contribute to&#13;
reducing rural poverty by facilitating local investments. The land titling&#13;
activities for indigenous communities would help conserve natural&#13;
resources in indigenous lands and slow down the advance of the&#13;
agricultural frontier in the Atlantic. The proposed project would&#13;
complement this by supporting applied extension in natural resources&#13;
matters targeted at small farmers and by providing additional resources in&#13;
a demand driven fashion to assist with the demarcation of indigenous&#13;
territories, subjects which are not well covered in the on-going project.&#13;
4.13  The project would also complement the Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance&#13;
Project (Credit No. 2871-NI), recently approved by the World Bank, and which aims&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
at strengthening the institutions that are responsible for road transport in Nicaragua&#13;
and rehabilitating the Chinandega-Izapa section of the trunk road connecting&#13;
Nicaragua with Honduras and Costa Rica, which is in the proposed project main&#13;
region. This portfolio of projects in combination with the currently proposed one&#13;
would attack not only the social manifestations of rural poverty (poor health services,&#13;
sanitation, education), but also its root cause, the lack of technical, managerial and&#13;
financial capacity at the local level which underlies much of the rural poverty in the&#13;
country and the inappropriate and destructive use of productive resources.&#13;
4.14 Consistency with Other Donor Activities. There has been relatively little&#13;
leadership in Nicaragua on the matter of donor coordination. However, it is clear that&#13;
the proposed project and the on-going IDB/IFAD-financed National Rural&#13;
Development Program (PNDR) are central to the GON efforts to address rural&#13;
poverty. The PNDR is a newly-created institution through an IDB project which will&#13;
concentrate its efforts on the Central Region, providing finance primarily for irrigation,&#13;
drainage and economic infrastructure including road rehabilitation. The proposed IDA&#13;
project would complement the PNDR in that it focuses on a region of the country not&#13;
covered by the PNDR and delegates most decision-making to local institutions. The&#13;
proposed project would also support the expansion of successful operations piloted by&#13;
bilateral donors and NGOs summarized in Annex 1, if these projects are deemed top&#13;
priority by communities or municipalities and are included in municipal plans. The&#13;
proposed project would also make use of successful approaches to local government&#13;
strengthening supported on a pilot scale by SIDA, GTZ and USAID.&#13;
F. BENEFICIARY SUPPORT&#13;
4.15  There is evidence of strong support for this proposal. In the workshops&#13;
carried out in five departments and 32 municipalities and including NGOs and&#13;
community representatives, participants presented a portfolio of un-funded projects or&#13;
project ideas of US$31 million, with 38 percent for "green" environmental protection,&#13;
26 percent for productive projects of poor farmers, 25 percent for rural infrastructure&#13;
and 12 percent for training, research and extension. Past failures in micro-project&#13;
implementation were attributed by participants to a lack of trained personnel and to a&#13;
lack of adequate financial management, both of which are key constraints to be&#13;
addressed by the proposed project.&#13;
5. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
5.1   The total project cost (excluding the proposed GEF component) is estimated at&#13;
US$40.4 million equivalent, including incremental recurrent costs and contingencies&#13;
and duties and taxes (US$9.8 million). Base costs are US$38.7 million and&#13;
contingencies are US$1.7 million. Project costs are estimated at March 1996 prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
The foreign exchange component would be US$5.9 million. The main expenditure&#13;
categories would be goods, works, operating costs (operation and maintenance and&#13;
incremental salaries), consultant services, grants for subprojects, training, refunding of&#13;
Project Preparation Advance and unallocated. Cost tables are presented in Annex 7.&#13;
The costs of the proposed GEF component would be finalized during preparation and&#13;
appraisal but are currently estimated at US$10.0 million. GEF funding of US$7.0&#13;
million is currently estimated to cover the incremental costs of the project and US$3.0&#13;
million would be co-financed by a donor.&#13;
B. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
5.2   The proposed IDA credit of US$30 million equivalent would finance 74.2&#13;
percent of total project costs (excluding taxes and duties) over an implementation&#13;
period of 5 years. It would cover 96 percent of foreign costs and 71 percent of local&#13;
costs. Local cost financing is justified on account of the high proportion of total costs&#13;
accounted for by local expenditures and because of the severe fiscal constraints on&#13;
central and municipal governments. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that&#13;
US$3.2 million (7.9 percent of the total project costs) would be made available by the&#13;
GON over the project period as counterpart funding as follows: $243 million in 1997,&#13;
$534 million in 1998, $672 million in 1999, $807 million in 2000 and $943 million in&#13;
2001. Other local funding would be met from the following sources: municipal&#13;
governments, US$2.8 million (6.8 percent of total project costs); and private&#13;
beneficiaries (farmers groups, legally established communities, NGOs), US$4.4 million&#13;
(10.9 percent). The complete financing plan is shown in Annex 7.&#13;
C. RECURRENT COSTS&#13;
5.3   Incremental recurrent costs increase from about US$1.3 million during the first&#13;
year of the project to about US$1.7 million during the last year and following years.&#13;
Most recurrent costs are associated with the salaries of the staff of the Municipal&#13;
Technical Units (US$0.6 million to US$1.0 million per year). The salaries of the&#13;
Municipal Technical Units of weaker municipalities (type C) would be financed&#13;
through the GON budget until the proposed fiscal transfers to disadvantaged&#13;
municipalities become effective. Maintenance and operation cost of subprojects would&#13;
be financed through municipal budgets or contributions of beneficiaries. These&#13;
incremental costs would be covered by a combination of IDA financing on a declining&#13;
basis during the project period, GON counterpart funds, increased local resource&#13;
mobilization and the proposed fiscal transfers that are expected to be in place before&#13;
the project's end.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
6. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND&#13;
MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.&#13;
Central Government&#13;
6.1   Steering Committee. The project's Steering Committee would include the&#13;
Minister of Agriculture, representing CONAGRO, the Minister of Finance, the&#13;
Minister of MARENA and the President of INIFOM. The Project's Steering&#13;
Committee would meet four times a year to: (i) review the project's progress; (ii)&#13;
discuss and take action on any development or natural resources issues related to the&#13;
project; (iii) coordinate project activities and other donor and GON programs in&#13;
natural resources management, rural poverty and rural development; and (iv) support&#13;
project implementation activities through its line agencies and representatives at the&#13;
regional level, if requested.&#13;
6.2   INIFOM. INIFOM would be responsible for the implementation of the Rural&#13;
Municipalities Development Component. Its specific responsibilities would include:&#13;
*  Managing relations with IDA, CONAGRO and MIFIN; ensuring that&#13;
(i) administrative tasks are performed and reporting related to the&#13;
project accounts, disbursement applications and audits are carried out;&#13;
(ii) legal agreements with implementing municipalities are observed in&#13;
the implementation of the component; (iii) adequate counterpart&#13;
funding is provided in GON' s budget; (iv) funds are being used for&#13;
their intended purposes; (v) agreed procurement procedures are being&#13;
followed; (vi) and periodic reports are prepared.&#13;
*  Assisting municipalities with the planning and subproject cycle;&#13;
overseeing agreements with municipal governments for the execution&#13;
of specific subprojects; approving and disbursing against municipal&#13;
plans; operating the monitoring and evaluation system; conducting&#13;
procurement on behalf of municipal governments; supervising sample&#13;
projects and municipal plans; appraising subprojects and/or involving&#13;
line agencies or consultants in the appraisal of subprojects beyond the&#13;
thresholds; approving subprojects delegating such approval to&#13;
municipalities under conditions stipulated in the Operational Manual;&#13;
and making decisions regarding increases in the project approval&#13;
thresholds of municipal governments.&#13;
*  Designing TORs and supervising consultants for the various training&#13;
and technical assistance programs under the component, including&#13;
assisting municipalities set up the Municipal Technical Units; designing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
and supervising technical assistance requested by municipalities on&#13;
aspects of municipal management; promoting the project with&#13;
communities and training community leaders and professionals; pre-&#13;
qualifying NGOs and consultants; maintaining updated rosters and&#13;
making them available to municipalities; and assisting the&#13;
Decentralization Commission of GON. To simplify the technical&#13;
assistance tasks, most would be bundled together into a small number&#13;
of contracts covering the following three themes: (i) recruitment and&#13;
training of MTUs and assistance to municipalities with the financial&#13;
control and monitoring and evaluation systems; (ii) promoting the&#13;
project and community structures and participatory planning; and (iii)&#13;
training of NGOs and professionals and certification of professionals.&#13;
Because INIFOM is not a specialized institution it would consult with&#13;
GON' s line agencies on aspects related to the training programs and&#13;
appraisal of sub-projects beyond the thresholds.&#13;
6.3   INIIFOM Project Implementation Unit. To enable INIFOM to perform&#13;
those functions, a Project Implementation Unit would be set up in INIFOM in charge&#13;
of liaison with IDA and coordinating activities among the various Directorates of&#13;
INIFOM involved in project implementation. The INIFOM Project Implementation&#13;
Unit would include: the Director of Planning, a Technical Support Group formed by&#13;
staff from the Directorates of Projects, Technical Assistance, Financing and&#13;
Administration and Regional Delegations of Le6n and San Carlos and other regional&#13;
delegations as new regions join the project; and six staff/consultants: implementation&#13;
coordinator, planning and technical assistance advisor, participation and gender&#13;
advisor, disbursements and accounting officer, procurement officer and internal&#13;
auditor and two support staff: secretary and driver. INIFOM's staff working on&#13;
project implementation would be located in the various Directorates and would&#13;
coordinate project activities through the Technical Support Group.&#13;
6.4   MARENA. MARENA would be responsible for the implementation of the&#13;
Natural Resources Policy and Institutions Component and the proposed Atlantic&#13;
Biodiversity Corridor Component (GEF). Its specific responsibilities would include:&#13;
Managing relations with IDA, CONAGRO and MIFIN. This would&#13;
involve ensuring that administrative tasks are performed and reporting&#13;
related to the project accounts, reimbursement applications and audit. It&#13;
would also involve ensuring that agreements, if any, with beneficiary&#13;
institutions of the Interinstitutional Assistance Program are being&#13;
observed, that adequate counterpart funding is provided in GON's&#13;
budget, that funds are being used for their intended purposes, that&#13;
agreed procurement procedures are being followed and that periodic&#13;
reports are prepared.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
*  Executing all the activities of the Natural Resources Component&#13;
including designing TORs and supervising consultants for the various&#13;
training and technical assistance programs, elaborating environmental&#13;
and land use plans and involving municipal and regional governments in&#13;
the process, disseminating and monitoring them, drafting legislation and&#13;
holding public consultations to discuss the proposals, and supervising&#13;
studies on natural resources policy matters. To simplify the technical&#13;
assistance tasks these would be bundled together into a small number of&#13;
contracts covering the following themes: (i) strengthening the&#13;
Directorate of Planning and Protected Areas of MARENA; (ii)&#13;
environmental and land use planning and monitoring; and (iii) the inter-&#13;
institutional assistance program.&#13;
&#149;  Preparing and implementing the Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor&#13;
Component. This would involve finalizing preparation of component&#13;
including the ABC strategy in collaboration with municipal and regional&#13;
governments, involving communities in preparation activities and&#13;
ensuring that all tasks for its implementation are carried out.&#13;
6.5   MARENA Project Unit. The MARENA Project Unit would include: the&#13;
Director of Planning,; the Director of Protected Areas; and a Technical Support Group&#13;
formed by staff from the Directorates of Forestry, Environment and Finance and&#13;
Administration. An Implementation Coordinator would be recruited to assist the&#13;
Directors of Planning and Protected Areas with reporting requirements and other&#13;
matters related to the project. Disbursements, accounting and procurement activities&#13;
would be carried out by the relevant Divisions of MARENA under the supervision of&#13;
the Component Coordinator.&#13;
6.6   Line Agencies. Line agencies such as MAG, INTA, INRA, INAA, and MCT&#13;
and special agencies such as FISE and PNDR, would have an important role to play in&#13;
assisting with the technical appraisal of sub-projects above the threshold (see Annex 4&#13;
and Operational Manual), quality control over and contribution to the training&#13;
programs (see Annex 4), and overall coordination of project initiatives with other&#13;
activities under their responsibility. The FISE in particular would make available its&#13;
computerized subproject monitoring system for adaptation to the proposed project,&#13;
rosters of consultants, operational manual and procedures for appraising economic&#13;
infrastructure subprojects, and its experience in executing demand driven subprojects&#13;
in general. The project would cover incremental travel expenses of staff of these&#13;
agencies or the cost of consultants to assist them in appraising projects or in reviewing&#13;
or delivering training. The Executive Committee for Public Sector Reform (CERAP)&#13;
would assume responsibility for developing the Decentralization Strategy. As a&#13;
condition of disbursements: (a) for subprojects over US$50,000 equivalent, INIFOM&#13;
would sign (an) agreement(s) with MAG, MCT, MARENA, INRA, INTA, INAA,&#13;
PNDR and/or FISE to set forth their respective responsibilities in the revision of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
subprojects of over US$50,000; and (b) for the preparation of decentralization studies&#13;
INIFOM would sign an agreement with CERAP.&#13;
Local Government&#13;
6.7    Municipal Technical Units (MTUs). The Municipal Technical Units would&#13;
be the key project coordinating and implementing structures at the local level. They&#13;
would be established or (where they currently exist) strengthened in each participating&#13;
municipality to: promote the project, manage the participatory process including&#13;
helping communities define needs and identify projects; elaborate municipal plans;&#13;
assist communities with recruitment of consultants and NGOs for identification,&#13;
preparation, implementation and operation of subprojects in accordance with the&#13;
agreed criteria set out in the Operational Manual; appraise subprojects; carry out&#13;
procurement tasks on behalf of comrnmunities; supervise subprojects and oversee&#13;
agreements with communities; and liaise with INIFOM and other GON agencies.&#13;
Each Municipal Technical Unit would report to the Mayor and would include at least&#13;
three staff: one professional staff to be nominated Local Project Coordinator (LPC) by&#13;
the mayor, subject to no-objection from INIFOM, which would be in charge of all&#13;
matters related to the project and which would meet regularly with the Regional&#13;
Delegate of INIFOM to review component progress at the municipal level; one&#13;
participation specialist responsible for project promotion and conmnunity participation&#13;
activities; and one accountant responsible for maintaining project accounts and help&#13;
upgrade municipal accounts. These staff would either be municipal staff or would be&#13;
specifically recruited for the tasks depending on municipal strength.&#13;
6.8    Municipal Council. The Municipal Council, with the assistance of the&#13;
Community Supervision Committee and the Municipal Technical Unit, would ratify the&#13;
Municipal Investment Plans, approve subprojects included in those plans, ensure that&#13;
agreements with INIFOM and communities are being followed and make decisions&#13;
regarding unforeseen circumstances affecting subprojects.&#13;
Communities16&#13;
6.9   Intercommunity Assembly (IA). The Intercommunity Assembly (IA) would&#13;
be the key community decision-making structure. It would be formed by&#13;
representatives of each comarca and indigenous communities within each municipality&#13;
and could include representatives of community organizations such as producers&#13;
associations, religious groups, local NGOs, etc. The IA would normally meet three&#13;
16  The community structures to be fostered and strengthened by the project are for the most part&#13;
informal consultative groups of individuals from different communities and lack juridical&#13;
personality. Given that their role in the project would continue to be mostly for consultation and&#13;
information transfer, the lack of legal status of these groups is not deemed to be a constraint to&#13;
project implementation. Nevertheless the project would support the legalization of community&#13;
structures through (i) the preparation of legislative initiatives; and (ii) technical assistance to&#13;
communities in seeking legal status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
times a year to: (i) discuss and define priorities for community needs; (ii) assist with&#13;
the elaboration, discuss and make recommendations regarding municipal plans; and&#13;
(iii) elect the members of the Community Supervision Committee.&#13;
6.10 Community Supervision Committee (CSC). The CSC is a small structure&#13;
chosen by the Intercommunity Assembly whose main role would be to ensure that&#13;
municipal governments respect community interests during selection of proposals and&#13;
project execution. It would: (i) supervise project and subproject execution on behalf&#13;
of communities; (ii) issue monitoring reports on local government activities both to&#13;
communities and INIFOM; (iii) assist Municipal Councils in making decisions about&#13;
municipal plans and subprojects; (iv) ensure that municipal council decisions are fully&#13;
disseminated among community members; and (v) keep the Intercommunity Assembly&#13;
informed of project execution at the municipal level.&#13;
6.11  Project User Group (PUG). The Project User Group would be composed of&#13;
those community members with a direct interest in the subproject. The PUG could be&#13;
an informal or formal organization such as a local NGO, depending on the subproject.&#13;
The PUG would be responsible for providing assistance for or implementing, operating&#13;
and maintaining community sub-projects, either directly or through contractors.&#13;
Municipal Planning and Subproject Cycles.&#13;
6.12 Local Decision-making Mechanisms. A key objective of the proposed&#13;
project is to establish a decentralized mechanism for decisions over local investments&#13;
for poverty reduction and improved natural resources management. These mechanisms&#13;
are summarized in the planning and subproject cycles shown in Diagrams 1 and 2 and&#13;
more extensively discussed in Annex 4 and the Operational Manual.&#13;
6.13   Restrictions. Eligibility of and restrictions on subprojects are discussed in&#13;
Annex 4 and Operational Manual. Among others: (i) no subprojects would be&#13;
financed in towns of more than 10,000 people; (ii) 60% of grants in each municipality&#13;
for the project period (5 years) would be for subprojects outside the main town/village&#13;
in a municipality (cabecera); and (3) subprojects eligible for financing by commercial&#13;
lending institutions would not qualify. Subprojects would also have to be consistent&#13;
with Environment and Land Use Plans and with the ABC in the Atlantic (Rural&#13;
Municipalities Development Component and Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor&#13;
Component).&#13;
6.14  Municipal eligibility. To be eligible for project financing, municipalities&#13;
would have to enter into an agreement with INIFOM (the INIFOM-Municipality&#13;
Eligibility and Financing Agreement; sample included in the Operational Manual), in&#13;
which they would agree to: (i) follow the rules in the Operational Manual; (ii) create&#13;
or strengthen the Municipal Technical Unit; (iii) establish project accounts and bring&#13;
financial controls up to IDA standards as per indicators discussed in Annex 10; (iv)&#13;
establish and operate a project monitoring and evaluation system; (v) promote the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
project with communities and bring the level of community participation and public&#13;
accountability up to the standards discussed in the Operational Manual and per&#13;
indicators of Annex 10; and (vi) develop municipal investment plans respecting&#13;
community priorities and the environment and land use plans (ELUP) developed under&#13;
the Natural Resources Policies and Institutions Components.&#13;

cycle.                           advance payments for subprojects&#13;
in municipal account.&#13;
6.15   Subproject cycle. The subproject cycle is summarized in Diagram 2 and&#13;
detailed in Annex 4 and in the Operational Manual. Subproject proposals would be&#13;
submitted according to guidelines described in the project's training manual (being&#13;
developed) and, though simple, would include: (i) subproject background and&#13;
description; (ii) description of the executing entity and identification of beneficiaries&#13;
and project user group(s); (iii) justification; (iv) expected economic, environmental and&#13;
poverty reduction benefits including at least one implementation and one impact&#13;
indicator; (v) budget and financial plan; (vi) training and technical assistance plan; and&#13;
(vii) operation and maintenance plan. Subproject appraisal would include: (1) a&#13;
technical evaluation; (2) an environmental evaluation; (3) an evaluation of poverty&#13;
reduction potential; and (4) a recommendation for approval, rejection or redesign.&#13;
6.16   Financing Ceilings. Each year there would be a financing ceiling per&#13;
municipality calculated on the basis of a formula applied to a total annual budget that&#13;
increases from the first to the last year of the project. The formula takes into account&#13;
population, rural poverty, size of municipality, participation effort, resource&#13;

mobilization effort and fixed costs. The formula and annual allocations by municipality&#13;
are detailed in the Operational Manual and in Annex 4.&#13;
6.17 Penalties and incentives. Quality control would be ensured more through ex-&#13;
post mechanisms than through ex-ante controls. First, those municipalities that are&#13;
able to implement participation and accountability practices and receive positive audit&#13;
reports after one year of operation will be able to approve subprojects up to&#13;
US$50,000. The decision to delegate approval of all subprojects between US$25,000&#13;
and US$50,000 to municipalities will be taken by INIFOM subject to non-objection by&#13;
IDA and based on information submitted by external financial and technical audits and&#13;
by the Community Supervision Committees. Second, a municipality that is considered&#13;
non-performing by INIFOM, for example due to dishonest practices or refusal to&#13;
follow participatory practices or to target the rural poor, would, subject to IDA's non-&#13;
objection, lose access to the IDA financed grants and the municipality's communities&#13;
would be informed of the decision.&#13;

6.18  Local Cofinancing. All subprojects (with the exception of capacity building&#13;
subprojects) would require matching funds from beneficiaries, whether individuals,&#13;
legally established communities, cooperatives, producers' associations, NGOs or&#13;
municipalities, in accordance with criteria listed in Table 1. Two types of cofinancing&#13;
would be allowed: (i) by beneficiaries, which could be in kind or labor; and (ii) by&#13;
municipal governments.&#13;
6.19   Operational Manual. The eligibility of beneficiaries, the amount of financing&#13;
under a grant, the selection, appraisal, approval, monitoring and evaluation procedures&#13;
of the grants/subprojects are contained in the Operational Manual and assurances of its&#13;
compliance were obtained during negotiations. Adoption of the Manual is required&#13;
before disbursements for the Rural Municipalities Development Component.&#13;

Note: see Annex 1 for definition of types A, B and C municipalities.&#13;
B. POVERTY TARGETING&#13;
6.20   The overall project would include four general poverty targeting mechanisms&#13;
to ensure that the rural poor are the main project beneficiaries: (i) Subprojects would&#13;
be identified, approved or endorsed by community members in the Intercommunity&#13;
Assembly, which would ensure that the poor have an opportunity to present their&#13;
needs. Since the majority of the population in rural areas is classified as poor, it would&#13;
be likely that the needs of the poor would receive higher priority in collective&#13;
decisions; and since the opportunity cost of participating in the participatory&#13;
structures is likely to be higher for the non-poor than for the poor, it is likely that the&#13;
poor would be better represented in these structures than the non-poor. (ii)&#13;
Subprojects would be limited to a maximum of US$700 per beneficiary. (iii)&#13;
Subproject proposals would have to provide evidence that they benefit the poor; and&#13;
community productive subprojects would have to specifically target the poor. (iv)&#13;
Municipalities with a higher number of poor people would receive proportionally more&#13;
resources.&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
6.21   The proposed project would be implemented over 5 years and is expected to&#13;
be completed in 2001. A detailed cronogram of project activities is included in the&#13;
project implementation plan in the project file. These are also summarized in the table&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
of implementation indicators in Annex 10. A detailed operational plan for the first&#13;
year of the project is in the project file. To minimize implementation complexity the&#13;
project would be developed in three phases, the first phase consisting of further&#13;
preparation and the second and third phases consisting of implementation.&#13;
6.22  First Phase. The first phase (year 0) is being financed through a Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF), PHRD Grant and GEF Block B grant and would focus on&#13;
capacity building: (i) technical assistance for INIFOM and MARENA including the&#13;
establishment of project units; (ii) development of the policy framework for&#13;
decentralization and natural resources; (iii) capacity building activities in up to twenty&#13;
three municipalities of Le6n and Chinandega; (iv) promotion of the project with&#13;
communities, participatory planning on a pilot scale and implementation of two&#13;
subprojects per municipality in ten municipalities; (v) training and certification of local&#13;
NGOs and consultants to assist municipal governments and communities with the&#13;
subproject cycle; (vi) developing municipal environment and land use plans for the&#13;
Pacific Region and a regional land use plan and Indigenous Peoples Development Plan&#13;
for the Atlantic region; and (vii) delineating the ABC in the Atlantic and complete&#13;
preparation of the GEF component.&#13;
6.23  Second Phase. The second phase would last about two years (years I and 2)&#13;
and would continue the capacity building activities and initiate the investment program&#13;
in the twenty three municipalities of Le6n and Chinandega in the Pacific region and&#13;
provide technical assistance for the nine municipalities of the Departments of San&#13;
Carlos and RAAS in the Atlantic already identified (see Maps).&#13;
6.24  Third Phase. During the third phase (years 3 through 5), which would start&#13;
after the second year review, the project would continue in Leon and Chinandega and&#13;
in the nine municipalities of the southeast and would be extended to any new candidate&#13;
municipalities mutually agreed to by the GON and IDA, in particular those of RAAS&#13;
and RAAN in the Atlantic. The biodiversity protection activities in the Atlantic, which&#13;
are expected to be financed by the GEF grant, would also start in the second phase.&#13;
Although a large area, the Atlantic is sparsely populated and thus the proportion of&#13;
project funds, other than those assigned to biodiversity protection, channeled to the&#13;
Atlantic would be rather small. No subproject would be financed in the Atlantic&#13;
region until agreement providing for the financing of the GEF component is effective&#13;
and IDA has approved an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan for the Atlantic&#13;
region (see conditions of disbursements in paragraph 8.6).&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
6.25  IDA would finance civil works, goods including machinery and vehicles,&#13;
technical assistance, consultants and studies, training, grants for subprojects and&#13;
incremental operating costs on a declining basis. Procurement arrangements are&#13;
summarized in Table 2. MARENA and INIFOM would carry out procurement for&#13;
their own institutional strengthening sub-components. During preparation MARENA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
has been procuring satisfactorily under a Japanese Grant. MARENA and INIFOM&#13;
have managed numerous donor projects and MARENA is currently initiating&#13;
implementation of an IDB project. Although both institutions already have some skills&#13;
on procurement, these would be fuirther enhanced by having staff in both institutions&#13;
undergo IDA sponsored procurement training courses. INIFOM would be responsible&#13;
for all procurement carried out under subprojects financed by the $23.4 million grant&#13;
facility. In most cases, this responsibility for procurement implementation would be&#13;
transferred to the individual Municipal Technical Units (MTUs) under the INIFOM-&#13;
Municipality Implementation Agreements described below (para. 6.39) which would&#13;
specify that procurement would be according to the relevant Bank Guidelines, and as&#13;
detailed in the Operational Manual for the project. Staff of Municipal Technical Units&#13;
would also receive procurement skills as part of their training.&#13;

under the project. No ICB is expected under the project. Small works for the&#13;
rehabilitation of the offices of INIFOM, MARENA and municipalities are estimated to&#13;
cost US$242,000, and may be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of quotations from at least three qualified domestic contractors.&#13;
Vehicles and computer equipment will be procured through LIB among suppliers with&#13;
established maintenance and service in Nicaragua. Contracts for goods (other than&#13;
vehicles and computers) would be procured under NCB. Standard bidding documents&#13;
(SBDs) issued by the Borrower and satisfactory to the Bank would be used for all&#13;
NCB under the project. Goods estimated to costs less than US$50,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$70,000 equivalent, of which&#13;
the aggregate of goods other than vehicles should not exceed US$40,000 equivalent,&#13;
may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of international shopping&#13;
procedures. Contracts for goods valued below US$25,000 up to an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$200,000 (US$100,000 for TNIFOM and US$100,000 for MARENA) would be&#13;
procured through national shopping based on price quotations from at least three&#13;
bidders.&#13;
6.27  Goods, Works and Technical Assistance for Subprojects. The average size&#13;
of a subproject is expected to be US$10,000. Few subprojects are expected to exceed&#13;
US$50,000. Around 500 subprojects (15 per municipality) would be implemented&#13;
each year. Each community would receive about one to two subprojects during the&#13;
project's five years. Approximately, 30% of these subprojects will require small civil&#13;
works, 30% technical assistance and 40% materials and equipment. Where&#13;
communities lack the capacity to make the necessary purchases of materials or do not&#13;
wish to do so, or for subprojects of municipalities, municipalities would make&#13;
purchases packaging the procurement for several projects whenever possible.&#13;
6.28  Procurement for works and goods for subprojects would follow: (1) National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) for goods and works over US$25,000; (2) National&#13;
Shopping procedures for contracts of goods below US$25,000 up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$22 million equivalent; (3) lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on&#13;
the basis of quotations from at least three qualified domestic contractors, for small&#13;
works estimated to cost less than US$25,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$22 million equivalent; and (4) direct contracting for small works in distant or&#13;
scattered rural areas and where competitive proposals cannot be obtained for contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$10,000 per subproject, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$1 million. Where municipalities are very weak and in the process of being&#13;
strengthened the management of procurement activities would be contracted out to a&#13;
stronger neighboring municipality, to a private firm or NGO or would be managed by&#13;
the Regional Delegation of INIFOM.&#13;
6.29  Direct technical assistance to rural communities on all aspects of community&#13;
organization and management, training for project operation and maintenance, and&#13;
technical assistance for on-farm and off-farm productive activities of the rural poor&#13;
would be treated as subprojects. A roster of eligible technical assistance providers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
would be maintained in INIFOM and in each Municipal Technical Unit. This roster&#13;
would be built with assistance from specialized GON agencies and private consultants&#13;
and NGOs covering different areas of expertise under criteria acceptable to IDA. It&#13;
would include both graduates from the training programs and other eligible&#13;
professionals selected on the basis of CV analysis, legal status, past project related&#13;
experience and interviews. The community and/or municipality would select a&#13;
consultant from this roster, which would be updated quarterly. The Municipal&#13;
Technical Units would assist communities with the procedures for selecting local&#13;
consultants and/or NGOs.&#13;
6.30  Technical assistance, consultants, training and studies would be carried out&#13;
according to the Guidelines for the use of Consultants By World Bank Borrowers and&#13;
by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). Technical assistance,&#13;
consultants, training and studies under the project would amount to US$ 6.8 million&#13;
equivalent excluding those to be provided as separate sub-projects. Consulting&#13;
services would consist of: (1) small consultant assignments for individuals and firms&#13;
providing direct technical assistance to MARENA, INIFOM and municipalities; and&#13;
(2) larger tasks for: (a) recruitment and training of MTUs and assistance to&#13;
municipalities with accounting and financial controls and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
systems; (b) promotion of project, establishment of community participatory&#13;
structures and participatory planning; (c) training and certification of NGOs and&#13;
professionals; (d) the inter-institutional assistance program; (e) strengthening of the&#13;
Directorate of Planning of MARENA; and (f) environment and land use planning and&#13;
monitoring. For small tasks MARENA, INIFOM and municipalities would recruit&#13;
individual consultants from a short list of at least three candidates for each post. A&#13;
sample letter of invitation, award criteria and a sample contract, all acceptable to IDA,&#13;
would be included in the Draft Operational Manual. For technical assistance at the&#13;
municipal level in the fields of - inter alia - community organization and management,&#13;
subproject preparation, and maintenance for on-farm and off-farrm activities of the&#13;
rural poor, INIFOM would: (1) on the basis of minimum criteria acceptable to IDA,&#13;
establish a roster of organizations with appropriate capabilities; (2) select at least&#13;
three organizations included in the roster to be invited to present technical and&#13;
financial proposals for the services; and (3) award contracts on the basis of criteria&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;
6.31  Prior and Post Review Procedures. Although the level of IDA prior review&#13;
of procurement would be low (25%), it would be compensated in several ways. First,&#13;
the project physical performance evaluation would analyze procurement issues.&#13;
Second, financial audits would include procurement aspects. Third, INIFOM's&#13;
Regional Delegations would assign a procurement coordinator in charge of helping&#13;
communities and municipalities conform to procurement rules. Fourth, both&#13;
MARENA and INIFOM and the MTUs would receive training on procurement. And&#13;
finally, during IDA supervision, random reviews would be conducted of subprojects,&#13;
including field visits and review of subproject documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
6.32 IDA would conduct a prior review of: (1) all LIB contracts; (2) the first two&#13;
NCB contracts for goods and works (other than for subprojects); (3) the first contract&#13;
each for goods and works for Subprojects procured under NCB; and (4) consultant&#13;
selection documentation (terms of reference, short lists, contract, etc.) for consultants&#13;
recruited by INIFOM and MARENA with an estimated contract amount of&#13;
US$100,000 or more for firms and US$30,000 or more for individuals; (5) terms of&#13;
reference for all other consulting services contracts; and (6) all contracts based on a&#13;
single source contracting or of a critical nature.&#13;
6.33   During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government of&#13;
Nicaragua that the above procurement arrangements would be followed.&#13;

6.34 Post-review would be carried out for other procurement by implementing&#13;
agencies (INIFOM and MARENA) and municipalities. For this purpose, both&#13;
MARENA and INIFOM would recruit auditors, under terms of reference satisfactory&#13;
to IDA, who would not only examine financial implementation, but also procurement&#13;
procedures, physical implementation and impact on beneficiaries. These auditors&#13;
would carry out annual audits on the basis of a sample not lower than 60 percent of&#13;
the IDA financed investments in the first project year, 50 percent in the second project&#13;
year and 40 percent in later years. For convenience and to avoid overlaps, the same&#13;
auditors would carry out an ex-post review of the expenditures and investments&#13;
financed by IDA.&#13;
E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
6.35   The project has a 5-year disbursement period and the Closing Date would be&#13;
March 31, 2002. (The associated ABC project would have also a 5-year&#13;
disbursement period and the Closing Date would be March 31, 2003). Agreed project&#13;
activities begun after February 28, 1996 and would be eligible for retroactive financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
up to a maximum of USSDR694,000. The estimated disbursement schedule has been&#13;
determined by the estimated availability of counterpart funding (see Table in Annex 7,&#13;
page 13), and the implementation capacity of the implementing agencies.&#13;
6.36  The Credit would be disbursed against eligible project expenditures at the rates&#13;
of: (i) 85% for civil works; (ii) 100% for foreign supplied and 80% of locally supplied&#13;
or manufactured machinery, equipment, vehicles, and furniture; (iii) 100% for&#13;
consultant services, training and studies; (iv) 100% of the amount of the grants for&#13;
subprojects (excluding all taxes); and (v) incremental recurrent costs on a declining&#13;
basis (80% first two years, 60% third and fourth years and 40% thereafter; see Table&#13;
in Annex 7, page 12). A PPF advance of SDR 1,050,000 has been approved and it&#13;
will be refinanced upon credit effectiveness.&#13;
6.37  Documentation of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made on the basis&#13;
of full documentation for all expenditures made under contracts requiring prior review&#13;
by IDA and amendments to contracts for consultant services raising the value of such&#13;
contracts above the prior review limits. These contracts are: (i) all LIB contracts for&#13;
vehicles; (ii) the first two NCB contracts for goods; and (iii) consultant services&#13;
contracts directly procured by MARENA and INIFOM with an estimated contract&#13;
amount of US$100,000 or more for firms and US$30,000 or more for individuals. For&#13;
all other contracts and expenditures, including training expenditures (tuition, travel&#13;
subsistence), disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOE)&#13;
for which supporting documents would be maintained by MARENA, INIFOM and&#13;
Municipal Technical Units and would be available to external auditors and to IDA for&#13;
staff review.&#13;
6.38  Special Accounts. Two Special Accounts in US dollars would be opened in a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA. Special Account A would be managed by&#13;
INIFOM and Special Account B would be managed by MARENA. The initial&#13;
deposits in the SA-A will be US$1.7 million and in Special Account B US$400,000&#13;
corresponding to about four months of expenditures under the project for each&#13;
agency. An initial deposit of up to US$1,000,000 for SA-A and US$200,000 for SA-&#13;
B may be requested. Once disbursements have reached SDR2,776,000 for SA-A and&#13;
SDR694,000 for SA-B, the balance of the authorized allocation can be requested up to&#13;
the authorized limit. The SAs would be replenished monthly on the Borrower's&#13;
request (but no less frequently than every three months), or whenever one third of the&#13;
authorized amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs first.&#13;
6.39 Flow of Funds to Municipalities. IDA Credit funds would be transferred by&#13;
INIFOM on behalf of the Government to municipalities for the financing of&#13;
subprojects under INIFOM-Municipality Implementation Agreements to be entered&#13;
into. Each municipality would open a bank account. INIFOM would transfer funds&#13;
(the grants) monthly from the Special Account "A" to each municipality account&#13;
under the provisions of the implementation agreements and based on the financial plan&#13;
included in the INIFOM-Municipality Agreement reflecting the investment plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
approved by the municipality and agreed to by INIFOM. Initial deposits equal to 20&#13;
percent of financial requirements would follow immediately after approval of MIPs&#13;
and signing of the agreements to enable municipalities and beneficiaries to cover&#13;
project preparation costs. Payments from each municipal account to contractors&#13;
would be made on the basis of payment authorizations signed by the mayor and the&#13;
MTU (local project coordinator). Funds required for central procurement would be&#13;
retained by INIFOM in its Special Account. When municipalities would transfer funds&#13;
to beneficiaries legally established, communities, NGOs, etc., for communal productive&#13;
activities, INIFOM-Municipality-beneficiary agreements would be signed namely for&#13;
transfer of ownership and subsequent maintenance of the goods and works financed.&#13;
6.40  Documentation. INIFOM and MARENA would be responsible for&#13;
submitting regular replenishment requests with appropriate supporting documents for&#13;
expenditures under the project. The documents would include: (i) a standard&#13;
withdrawal application (Form 1903) for the total amount of eligible project&#13;
expenditures (but not the amount advanced to municipalities) to be replenished into&#13;
INIFOM's Special Account with a copy of the monthly bank statement for that&#13;
account; (ii) SOE form which will provide the summary of category expenditures&#13;
(INIFOM and MARENA) including grants for subprojects (INIFOM); (iii) standard&#13;
summary sheets (designed for each subproject and included in the disbursement letter)&#13;
and supporting documentation for all expenditures above the procurement prior&#13;
review thresholds; and (iv) a reconciliation statement for the special account. The use&#13;
of grants by municipalities and communities would be monitored through auditing&#13;
procedures, the monitoring systems and project and sub-project supervision&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
F.  FINANCIAL CONTROLS, AccouNTs AND AUDITNG&#13;
6.41  Financial Management Capacity. A diagnostic by professional accountants&#13;
of the financial capacity of the two implementing agencies (INIFOM and MARENA)&#13;
and of the thirty-two municipalities expected to participate in the project showed that&#13;
only MARENA, INIFOM and the two largest municipalities would be able to meet&#13;
IDA's recommended project accounting procedures. While all municipalities had a&#13;
basic cash accounting system that adequately recorded income and expenditure,&#13;
primary deficiencies found were: (i) lack of financial information on programs/projects&#13;
and no records of municipal assets; (ii) weaknesses in internal control; and (iii) lack&#13;
of adequately trained staff. INIFOM also had weak areas, particularly in internal&#13;
control, which are being addressed by the Comptroller's Office as part of the&#13;
Institutional Restructuring Agreement supported by the Institutional Development&#13;
Credit.&#13;
6.42 Technical assistance will be provided to each municipality to help implement&#13;
new accounting systems and procedures. INIFOM will also prepare revised standard&#13;
accounting procedures for municipalities in coordination with the Ministry of Finance&#13;
which is implementing the Institutional Development Credit. During project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
implementation, additional assistance will be provided to weaker municipalities to&#13;
further strengthen financial management, particularly in the areas of budgeting and&#13;
cash management, so they can effectively manage the increased fiscal transfers&#13;
expected by the end of the project period.&#13;
6.43   Project Financial Statements and Financial Reporting. Project financial&#13;
statements to be prepared by each participating municipality would include a statement&#13;
of sources and uses of funds, and a register of project assets or balance sheet where&#13;
appropriate. The funds flow statement would indicate sources (IDA, as well as&#13;
counterpart) and expenditures in accordance with main project components and&#13;
disbursement categories. Where municipalities have multiple subprojects, data would&#13;
be shown separately for each subproject to facilitate project monitoring and&#13;
preparation of project monitoring indicators. Project financial statements would show&#13;
actual and pending payments against budgeted. Information on sources and uses of&#13;
funds would be provided monthly. Information reported would also include the value&#13;
of contracts signed, i.e. commitments, relative to actual and pending payments.&#13;
6.44 The implementing agencies (INIFOM and MARENA) would maintain separate&#13;
records and accounts for project expenditures as well as a register of assets purchased&#13;
with project funds. They would also have the responsibility for preparing the project's&#13;
financial statements, including sources and uses of funds statements, according to&#13;
internationally accepted accounting standards. INIFOM would include balance sheets&#13;
in the financial statements. MARENA and INIFOM would also receive technical&#13;
assistance to help establish accounting procedures acceptable to IDA. INIFOM&#13;
would prepare financial statements for its own managed funds as well as consolidated&#13;
project financial statements based on the project financial statements submitted by each&#13;
municipality.&#13;
6.45   Auditing. A process for selection of auditors and the auditor's TOR were&#13;
agreed with INIFOM and MARENA during appraisal. The selection process includes&#13;
pre-qualifying audit firms, contracting auditors for one year with a provision to extend&#13;
for a further two years based on satisfactory performance, and initiating the process&#13;
for selection of auditors during project preparation with the objective of having&#13;
auditors in place by the start of loan disbursements. Both INIFOM and MARENA&#13;
would contract audit firms to audit the consolidated financial statements for the&#13;
components of the project.&#13;
6.46  The auditors report would include audits of the special account, an opinion on&#13;
the use of statement of expenditures (SOEs), confirmation that project&#13;
implementation was in accordance with provisions of the legal agreement and&#13;
verification of procurement transactions. The auditor's TORs also include a review of&#13;
internal controls and preparation of a management letter. Audit reports would be&#13;
submitted to IDA up to within six months of the close of the fiscal year. The first&#13;
audit reports would cover the first year's disbursement as well as disbursements under&#13;
the Japanese grant under separate TORs. Most project funds are expected to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
disbursed for a large number of small subprojects averaging about US$10,000 in at&#13;
least 32 municipalities, some of difficult access. It is expected that the external&#13;
auditors to a large extent will base their work on that of the internal auditors and will&#13;
exercise good judgment in selecting municipalities for direct audit to reduce the cost of&#13;
the audit.&#13;
6.47 Technical audits would be carried out separately. Technical audits would&#13;
consist of simple checks of subprojects ensuring that what is purchased is in fact there&#13;
and would exclude any assessment of whether resources were used efficiently or&#13;
appropriately or any technical issues.&#13;
G. SUPERVISION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
6.48  Supervision. Day-to-day supervision of the project would be carried out by&#13;
MARENA and INIFOM. IDA and GON would monitor the project's overall progress&#13;
during joint supervision missions, annual reviews and an Implementation Completion&#13;
Review.&#13;
6.49 Because of the large number of sub-projects which would be financed under&#13;
the Rural Municipalities Development Component, the demands for close supervision&#13;
would be high, and the financing plan includes resources for INIFOM to enable it to&#13;
meet them. There would be three supervision mechanisms for activities carried out by&#13;
municipal governments including subprojects: (i) by beneficiaries: the Community&#13;
Supervision Committee (CSC) would supervise implementation of municipal plans&#13;
and agreed projects and issue execution reports for INIFOM and the Intercommunity&#13;
Assembly; (ii) by municipalities: the Municipal Technical Units would supervise&#13;
subprojects executed by contractors and/or communities while Project User Groups&#13;
would supervise contractors implementing sub-projects on behalf of communities; and&#13;
(iii) by INIFOM: the Regional Delegation of INIFOM would also supervise&#13;
municipality and beneficiary compliance with terms of agreements with INIFOM and&#13;
municipal plans and subproject implementation.&#13;
6.50 Monitoring. Both MARENA and INIFOM would monitor overall project&#13;
progress and provide quarterly reports (March 31, June 30, September 30 and&#13;
December 31) to the Minister of Finance, CONAGRO and IDA. An outline for&#13;
quarterly reports is included in Annex 10. Progress would be measured against the&#13;
implementation indicators included in Tables A10. 1 to Al0.6 and Figure 10.1, Annex&#13;
10. The reports would be furnished to IDA no more than one month after the&#13;
completion of each quarter.&#13;
6.51  Project Launch Workshops. Upon project effectiveness, GON would&#13;
organize four project launch workshops targeted at: (i) MARENA and INIFOM; (ii)&#13;
Municipalities; (iii) Community leaders and local NGO representatives; and (iv) other&#13;
GON agencies supporting the project. Details are given in Annex 11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
6.52 Regular Supervision. Several times a year GON and IDA would organize&#13;
joint project supervision missions. Project supervision would provide implementation&#13;
assistance. Before each mission, GON and IDA would agree on the major subjects to&#13;
be supervised, which would always include an evaluation of the project's progress&#13;
based on the monitoring indicators, compliance with legal covenants, and procurement&#13;
and financial management supervision. Immediately after each mission, IDA would&#13;
send an Aide Memoire to GON which would contain the major agreements reached&#13;
during the mission and recommendations. Annex 11 provides more details on&#13;
supervision.&#13;
6.53 Annual Reviews. Each year, GON and IDA would carry out annual reviews.&#13;
Before such a review would take place GON and IDA would agree on detailed TORs&#13;
and staffing of the review teams. In particular the reviews would analyze: (i) status of&#13;
community participation and the role of municipalities in promoting it; (ii) status of&#13;
technical assistance and training program for municipal governments; (iii) status of&#13;
municipal planning; (iv) status of training of consultants and local availability of&#13;
trained consultants; (v) functioning of all aspects of the subproject cycle; (vi) status&#13;
of environmental planning and monitoring system; (vii) advances in the legal&#13;
proposals; (viii) status of the interinstitutional training program; (ix) status of&#13;
preparation and implementation when enacted of mechanism of fiscal transfers to local&#13;
governments; and (x) procurement, disbursements and financial aspects. Annual&#13;
reviews would also analyze the status of development and implementation of (i) the&#13;
legal framework for decentralization and natural resources; (ii) the Atlantic&#13;
Biodiversity Corridor strategy (see Annex 4 and para. 3.9 and 3.11); and (iii) the legal&#13;
framework to ensure the effective application of the rights of indigenous peoples as&#13;
expressed in the Constitution and Autonomy Law of 1987. During negotiations&#13;
assurances were obtained that these annual reviews would be carried out and that&#13;
GON would take remedial measures.&#13;
6.54  Implementation Completion Report. Not later than six months after the&#13;
project closing date, GON and IDA would carry out a joint project completion review&#13;
and produce an Implementation Review Report. Following this review, GON would&#13;
present to IDA a plan for the future operation of the project, furnish the plan to IDA&#13;
for comments, and carry out the plan taking into account IDA's comments thereon.&#13;
7. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.  SOCIAL IPACT&#13;
7.1   Target Population. The project is designed with the capacity to reach, directly&#13;
or indirectly, the rural population of the 32 selected municipalities. This coverage&#13;
would expand in the second phase with the inclusion of additional areas. The rural&#13;
population of the 32 municipalities was estimated in 1993 to be about 477,000. Of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
these, it is expected that the direct beneficiaries would be around 300,000 people, or&#13;
around 50,000 families, mainly small farmers and fishermen. Project investments per&#13;
capita per year considering the entire population of the 32 municipalities would&#13;
amount to about US$5. This level of expenditure is comparable to that seen in similar&#13;
Bank projects in Mexico -- about US$8 per capita per year -- and Colombia -- about&#13;
US$6 per year for equivalent definitions of target populations. Since the project&#13;
would establish a new system for financing and implementing sub-projects at the&#13;
municipal level, it is expected that in the longer term a much larger number of people&#13;
would benefit directly as further financing, namely from the proposed fiscal transfers&#13;
legislation, enters the system.&#13;
7.2   The rural poor. Some 40,000 households, over 70% of the region's rural&#13;
population, are below the poverty line. More than 60% are small farmers. On average&#13;
it would be necessary to invest between US$ 750 and US$ 4,000 per family to&#13;
increase a small farm income enough to pull the household out of poverty. The&#13;
expected US$6.7 million of productive subprojects would thus allow between 1,600&#13;
and 10,000 of such families to become non-poor (25% of the region's rural poor if the&#13;
higher figure is achieved). Comparatively, in 1993 only 720 poor farmers in the region&#13;
received some kind of assistance (averaging US$560). The proposed project would&#13;
increase the number of beneficiaries between 2.5 and 13 times. The rural poor would&#13;
also benefit from the non-productive subprojects: environment, public infrastructure&#13;
and capacity building (see Annex 12 for details).&#13;
7.3   Women. Because of the different roles that men and women play in society,&#13;
the project would potentially benefit men and women differently (see Annex 3 for a&#13;
more detailed discussion of gender aspects). First, although the project supports both&#13;
men's and women's organizations, the project would specifically promote women's&#13;
involvement in local and municipal governments and this involvement would be&#13;
maintained (see performance indicators in Annex 10). Second, the project would&#13;
attempt to diminish discrepancies in access to information and resources that typically&#13;
exist between men and women. Third, the project would support both men's and&#13;
women distinctive productive activities through the municipal funds (these would&#13;
include the basic grains produced by both men and women as well as agro-industries&#13;
and food processing, fruit and vegetable production, apiculture, spices and medicinal&#13;
plants, small livestock, and forest-based artesenal activities in the case of women).&#13;
Finally, the project would finance natural resource subprojects according to the&#13;
priorities of men, which tend to have both a commercial orientation, and women,&#13;
which have a commercial and social focus (for example, domestic water and energy&#13;
subprojects). A gender advisor would be placed in INIFOM to ensure that gender&#13;
concerns are present during implementation of the municipal development component.&#13;
7.4   Indigenous peoples. A Social Assessment for the Sutiaba in Le6n and&#13;
Chinandega was produced during preparation of the IDA components while an&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan for the Atlantic region is well under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
preparation.'9 Both the IDA and the proposed GEF components would benefit&#13;
indigenous peoples. First, indigenous communities would be able to submit&#13;
subproject proposals identified by them to local governments and would participate in&#13;
the decisions over local planning and subproject approval through their traditional&#13;
representative structures. Second, through subprojects indigenous beneficiary&#13;
communities would be eligible for technical assistance (including legal) for community&#13;
development including that required for the elaboration of community land titling&#13;
proposals. Third, indigenous communities would be the main executors of the&#13;
proposed GEF activities where the biodiversity corridor overlaps with their territory&#13;
through quid pro quo agreements under which communities would receive&#13;
development assistance prioritized by them in exchange for commitments to conserve&#13;
biodiversity.&#13;
7.5   Institutions. Institutional beneficiaries at the national level would be&#13;
MARENA and INJEOM, the legal offices of the Executive Branch, the Legislature,&#13;
the Judiciary and enforcing agencies. The increase in their capacity to legislate and to&#13;
enforce regulations governing natural resources and the environment would be&#13;
indirectly beneficial to all of Nicaraguan society.&#13;
7.6    At the municipal level, the most important benefit would be the legacy of&#13;
much-improved capacity among local groups and municipal government to identify,&#13;
prepare, evaluate and implement subprojects and in particular of much improved&#13;
capacity of communities of rural poor to voice their demands and of local governments&#13;
to meet them. This would be a valuable long-term asset.&#13;
B. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
7.7    The project would contribute to the improved management of biodiversity&#13;
forests, soils, water and fisheries. In total it is estimated that in the Pacific 25,000&#13;
hectares or 13% of current crop area would benefit from less erosion while 3% of&#13;
regional mangrove area would receive direct protection (see Annex 12). Additionally&#13;
the project would help protect the high biodiversity of volcanic ecosystems, improve&#13;
waterflow controls and help stabilize some watercourses. The GEF Component would&#13;
specifically support biodiversity conservation in the Atlantic. Because some of the&#13;
subprojects, particularly public infrastructure subprojects, may pose modest&#13;
environmental risks, the project is rated as a "B". There are two mechanisms for&#13;
screening out risky subprojects (see Annexes 4, 6 and Operational Manual): (i)&#13;
subproject approval would have to follow the guidelines detailed in Annexes 4 and 6,&#13;
in the Operational Manual and in the background study "Sistema de Procedimientos&#13;

&#13;
&#13;

Ambientalespara la Gesti6n AmbientalMunicipat'; and (ii) subprojects would have&#13;
to be consistent with priorities and restrictions reflected in the Environment and Land&#13;
Use Plans for the Pacific and Atlantic and with the ABC strategy. Additionally no&#13;
disbursements for subprojects would take place until the ABC component (GEF) is&#13;
declared effective, and until an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan for the Atlantic&#13;
is approved by IDA.&#13;
C. ECONOMIC AND FISCAL IMPACTS&#13;
7.8   Economic Efficiency. There are three dimensions of economic impacts from&#13;
the proposed project: (i) from decentralization; (ii) from natural resource and&#13;
environmental policy reform; and (iii) from subprojects.&#13;
7.9   The expected economic impacts from decentralization are primarily three: (i)&#13;
reduction in the costs of delivering public services relative to the costs of these&#13;
services if they were managed centrally; (ii) a better optimum (more efficient mix) of&#13;
local investments relative to the mix accruing if decisions were taken by a centralized&#13;
agency; and (iii) better community structures.&#13;
7.10  The expected economic impacts from natural resource and environmental&#13;
policy reform are primarily three: (i) economic efficiency gains from eliminating&#13;
conflicting regulations on natural resource use; (ii) reduction in the cost of governing&#13;
due to increased government credibility from enforcing a clearer set of regulations than&#13;
under the without project scenario; and (iii) better internalization of environmental&#13;
externalities by the public, private and NGO sectors.&#13;
7.11   The expected economic impacts from subprojects are: (i) reduction in the&#13;
costs of municipalities and communities in identifying, preparing, implementing and&#13;
operating subprojects; (ii) improved decision-making by private farmers and other&#13;
rural poor from the capacity building projects; (iii) economic gains from enhanced&#13;
environmental protection; and (iv) economic surpluses from economic infrastructure&#13;
and higher productivity from on-farm and off-farm economic subsistence activities to&#13;
be supported by the project.&#13;
7.12  Evaluation of Subprojects. The economic analysis focused only on a subset&#13;
of these benefits: the economic impacts of the expected portfolio of environmental,&#13;
infrastructure and productive subprojects. These estimates are fraught with&#13;
uncertainties and are presented to illustrate orders of magnitude of expected benefits.&#13;
Because subprojects are demand driven and it is not known ex-ante what community&#13;
and municipality choices would be, two estimates of sub-project demand were&#13;
developed by polling municipal governrments, NGOs and beneficiaries directly. These&#13;
estimates are summarized in Annexes 2 and 3.&#13;
7.13   Accounting for only the expected benefits from a selected number of expected&#13;
subprojects (municipal investments), but accounting for all the project investment and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
recurrent costs, yielded a benefit/cost ratio of 1.04, and a net present value of US$2.3&#13;
million (10% discount rate, Table 4). Hence, given that unaccounted benefits are&#13;
expected to be large, the project is likely to be highly economically viable.&#13;
7.14 Evaluation of Decentralization and Natural Resources Policy and&#13;
Institutional Reform Benefits. Although the costs and benefits from decentralization&#13;
were not quantified, other Bank and IDA projects confirm that decentralization&#13;
typically leads to a more efficient portfolio of investments, which are more likely to be&#13;
maintained and sustained and implemented, at a lower cost than when these&#13;
investments are channeled through centralized structures (see Section 4.D on Lessons&#13;
from Past Bank Lending). Because these other non-quantified benefits may be equal&#13;
to or more important than subproject benefits, and because quantifying those benefits&#13;
would help maintain GONs commitment to the project, a study of all the economic&#13;
impacts of the project, including those arising from decentralization and policy and&#13;
institutional reform would be conducted during the first year of the project.&#13;

7.15   Public Sector Role. There is also the question of whether the financing of&#13;
proposed categories of investments is better handled by the local public sector or by&#13;
the private sector (all would be executed by the private sector). For the subproject&#13;
categories of environment, public infrastructure and capacity building the rationale for&#13;
public sector involvement is clear since these entail substantial externalities and/or are&#13;
public goods. The issue is not as clear cut for collective private projects. The principle&#13;
underlying the public financing of collective private investments is that the initial&#13;
subsidies can help poor people raise their standards of living above the subsistence&#13;
level and help initiate a process of capital accumulation among the rural poor that&#13;
ultimately would help pull them out of poverty. If decisions to finance projects of&#13;
disadvantaged communities were left to the private sector it would be very unlikely&#13;
that the poorest communities would initially be able to attract private financing&#13;
(though once the profitability of investments and community management capacity is&#13;
demonstrated this may not remain a constraint). Hence public sector support for&#13;
collective private projects can be justified as an instrument for poverty alleviation.&#13;
There are precedents for this, for example in the Bank projects in Northeast Brazil and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
in DRD I and II in Mexico which financed similar categories of investments for&#13;
disadvantaged communities.&#13;
7.16  Fiscal impact. Fiscal impacts refer to the benefits foregone due to the&#13;
allocation of counterpart funds for project activities. These are significant only for the&#13;
Municipal Development Component. These counterpart funds (US $4.8 million for&#13;
GON and municipalities) would be primarilv provided by municipalities from own&#13;
revenues or from resources transferred from central government. Municipal co-&#13;
financing of subprojects is likely to result in: (i) a smaller percentage of municipal&#13;
investments targeted to urban areas (but not necessarily a decline in absolute terms);&#13;
(ii) a higher percentage of municipal funds allocated to environment and rural public&#13;
infrastructure at the expense of more traditional municipal investments (urban parks,&#13;
recreation facilities, urban street asphalting, etc.); and (iii) a decline in local programs&#13;
managed centrally (by MAS, INIFOM, Institute of Sports and National Assembly), but&#13;
an increase in the efficiency of fiscal resources used in the process. Additional fiscal&#13;
resources from GON (US$1.2 million) to support activities being directly implemented&#13;
by MARENA and INIFOM would also be needed. These would be justified since (i)&#13;
MARENA has already undergone drastic cuts in personnel and needs now to be&#13;
strengthened to be able to execute its priority functions in policy-making and&#13;
enforcement; and (ii) INIFOM has a key role to play in the short and medium future in&#13;
support of the process of fiscal and administrative decentralization.&#13;
D. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
7.17  There are four dimensions of sustainability: (i) sustainability of the local&#13;
institutional mechanisms, and in particular of whether communities will be able to&#13;
continue defining their priorities and causing municipal governments to respond to&#13;
them; (ii) sustainability of financial resources for disadvantaged rural municipalities,&#13;
which would allow these to meet community demands; (iii) sustainability of&#13;
subprojects, that is, their maintenance and replicability; and (iv) sustainability of&#13;
mechanisms for intemalizing environment values in public decision-making. There are&#13;
also important sustainability issues related to the proposed GEF component.&#13;
7.18   Sustainability of local institutional mechanisms --would be promoted by (i)&#13;
demonstrating through real experiences and training that both communities and local&#13;
government officials and politicians gain from the adoption of participatory methods;&#13;
communities gain a better portfolio of projects and local politicians gain a more&#13;
satisfied electorate; (ii) making resources available to disadvantaged municipalities&#13;
both through the project and through the proposed fiscal transfers legislation to make&#13;
it worthwhile for communities to organize themselves in order to cause local&#13;
governments to channel those resources to meet community priorities; (iii) making full&#13;
information about the project available to communities through project promotion; and&#13;
(iv) providing initial support to community and municipality decision mechanisms&#13;
(Intercommunity Assembly and Community Supervision Committee) that have low&#13;
operational costs and thus are likely to be maintained once their usefulness is proven.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
7.19  Sustainability of rinancial resources for disadvantaged municipalities--&#13;
would be secured through: (i) the proposed fiscal transfers legislation which, in a&#13;
budget neutral manner, would, if enacted, put in place a financing mechanism for local&#13;
governments equivalent to at least 4% of the GON revenues and which would be&#13;
transferred as block grants to those municipalities with greatest need according to the&#13;
formula similar to the one discussed in Annex 4; and (ii) technical assistance through&#13;
the project to disadvantaged municipalities on local resource mobilization.&#13;
7.20 Sustainability of community and municipality investments -- maintenance&#13;
and replicability -- would be met through five mechanisms: (i) the proposed fiscal&#13;
transfers from the central govermnent would, if enacted, put more resources at the&#13;
disposal of municipal governments which could be used to meet recurrent and&#13;
operational costs; (ii) the participatory process would ensure that those projects of&#13;
highest priority to communities would be financed and these communities would thus&#13;
have an interest in ensuring subproject sustainability; (iii) an acceptable operational and&#13;
maintenance plan, including definition of responsibilities for these activities, would be&#13;
a criteria for subproject approval; (iv) the project would support training to municipal&#13;
governments, communities and professionals on subproject operation and maintenance&#13;
and cost recovery mechanisms; and (v) in the particular case of productive&#13;
subprojects, cost recovery into beneficiary (association, cooperative, legally&#13;
established community) managed funds would be promoted as a means to generate&#13;
financial resources to replicate the subproject and to reach the largest number of&#13;
beneficiaries within a community.&#13;
7.21   Sustainability of mechanisms for internalizing environmental values in&#13;
public decision-making -- would be ensured through: (i) an active training program&#13;
including training of trainers and curricula development on environmental policies&#13;
targeted at key institutions with responsibilities over environment policy; (ii)&#13;
strengthening the monitoring and watchdog function of MARENA over other GON&#13;
agencies and regional and local governments; and (iii) streamlining of MARENA&#13;
through the Institutional Restructuring Agreement to be supported by the Institutional&#13;
Development Credit.&#13;
7.22  Sustainability of conservation activities (GEF) in the Atlantic -- would be&#13;
secured through (i) a financial mechanism currently being designed that would raise&#13;
additional resources from donors and local sources and would finance the recurrent&#13;
costs of conservation activities in the Atlantic and investment subprojects beyond the&#13;
closing date of the GEF component; and (ii) information and training for indigenous&#13;
and non-indigenous conmnunities and demarcation of territories of indigenous&#13;
communities which have a stake in ensuring the sustainability of natural resources in&#13;
the Atlantic region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
E. RISKS&#13;
7.23  There are five main risks in the implementation of the project, as follows:&#13;
7.24 The first relates to project complexity and to the capacity of INIFOM and&#13;
MARENA to implement the components under their responsibility. This risk would be&#13;
addressed by (i) establishing fully staffed Component Implementation Units in each&#13;
institution that would manage the INIFOM component and the MARENA&#13;
components, respectively, as two separate, but interlinked projects; (ii) processing the&#13;
GEF component as an associated, but separate operation with different timing,&#13;
documentation, legal agreements and supervision; (iii) grouping most technical&#13;
assistance activities in six technical assistance contracts, three to be managed by&#13;
INIFOM and another three by MARENA; (iv) phasing in project activities focusing&#13;
the first phase on capacity building, the second phase on preliminary investments and&#13;
the third phase on expanding the investment program and initiating activities under the&#13;
GEF component.&#13;
7.25  The second relates to the capacity of municipalities and beneficiaries to&#13;
generate high quality rural subproject proposals and implement them satisfactorily&#13;
without leakage of funds. These issues and how the project would deal with them are&#13;
detailed in Annex 4. This risk would be addressed as follows: (i) as a condition of&#13;
municipal participation, local governments would establish a Municipal Technical Unit&#13;
with at least two staff with expertise on participation and the subproject cycle and who&#13;
would undergo training and receive technical assistance; (ii) all municipalities would&#13;
establish project accounts following IDA standards, the project would provide&#13;
technical assistance for improving overall municipal financial controls as per agreed&#13;
indicators, and the component intemal auditor in INFOM would systematically carry&#13;
out audits of INIFOM and municipalities; (iii) the project would invest heavily in&#13;
training local professionals (local private consultants, NGOs and local government and&#13;
GON staff) in all aspects of the subproject cycle; these professionals would be the&#13;
main vehicle for ensuring the quality of subprojects; (iv) specialized line agencies&#13;
would be requested to issue a technical opinion for subprojects greater than&#13;
US$50,000; (v) both external and internal audits assisted by a social supervision&#13;
mechanism through the communities are included in project design; and (vi)&#13;
municipalities that misuse project funds would be penalized according to agreed&#13;
procedures (para. 6.17).&#13;
7.26  The third risk is that the government might weaken its efforts to reform natural&#13;
resource and indigenous peoples policies and develop and implement a coherent&#13;
decentralization strategy. Some GON agencies in particular may feel threatened by&#13;
decentralization. An associated risk is that the legislation on fiscal decentralization&#13;
would not be approved. This risk would not impact the project directly but would&#13;
make it less likely that it would be sustainable. These risks cannot be mitigated totally,&#13;
but efforts would be made under the project to carry out analytical studies of the costs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
and benefits of reform and decentralization and to conduct study tours to similar&#13;
projects in LAC to show GON the economic benefits from these strategies.&#13;
7.27 The fourth risk, also related to government commitment, concerns the level of&#13;
priority assigned to this project and the consequent security of counterpart funds. All&#13;
current evidence suggests a strong political commitment on account of: (i) the urgency&#13;
of rural poverty alleviation; (ii) the immediacy of the combatant and refugee&#13;
resettlement problem; (iii) the growing pressure from many sources to reverse the&#13;
process of resource degradation; (iv) political pressure from local governments which&#13;
have been able to push the reform agenda in their direction, for example in the recent&#13;
reform to the Constitution; and (v) the advances in proposing legislation on fiscal&#13;
decentralization. Moreover, the level of counterpart funding is covenanted in the&#13;
project's legal agreement.&#13;
7.28  Finally, there is a possible risk of competition with other donor agencies, due&#13;
to the rather poor record of donor co-ordination. As far as can be ascertained, the&#13;
proposed project would be complementary to other donor efforts. Moreover, this risk&#13;
has been minimized through consultations with GON, donor agencies and the IDB,&#13;
and IDA supervision missions would continue placing a high priority on coordination&#13;
with other agencies active in the natural resources and rural development field and in&#13;
decentralization.&#13;

RURAL MUNICIPALITIES PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
BACKGROUND: THE POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT FOR&#13;
DECENTRALIZATION "&#13;
1. RATIONALE FOR DECENTRALIZATION&#13;
Rationale for Decentralization. Decentralization of decision-making and&#13;
responsibility to the local level is considered an imnportant element in improving rural&#13;
development programs and natural resource management; a perception shared by&#13;
government, NGOs and foreign donors. This derives from the extreme weakness in the&#13;
mechanisms which exist to ensure that public investments are efficient and consistent with&#13;
rural development and natural resource management potentials at the local level. Where&#13;
contemplated, municipal-level priorities and opportunities have been limited to diagnostics&#13;
and consultations usually carried out by central GON agencies or outside programs rather&#13;
than through ongoing dialogue and shared responsibility. Thus, the distribution of&#13;
resources and investment activities heavily reflect central government priorities.'2 In&#13;
contrast, the principle underlying decentralization is that national priorities be satisfied&#13;
through incentives and broad thematic and zonal targeting of investmnent resources and&#13;
local mechanisms be preferred for their specific disposition. Local governments are closer&#13;
to the people and problems that result from poverty and often also from resource&#13;
degradation and hence internalize those costs better and more rationally prioritize the use&#13;
of scarce investment resources. In the limited instances where "local choice" mechanisms&#13;
have been functioning in Nicaragua the results are generally positive. The GTZ/INIFOM&#13;
Proyecto de Fortalacimiento de la Autonomia Municipal (FAMU) is one exarnple, and&#13;
the SIDA/INIFOM development programs for infrastructure and community works in&#13;
pern-urban poverty zones is another.!3- There is also an expanding body of evidence&#13;
elsewhere on the advantages of decentralized rural development solutions, several of which&#13;
are being supported by the World Bank in LAC, for example in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia&#13;
and Mexico.&#13;
I/    For a more complete treatment of the subject, see Project Working Papers: (3)&#13;
"Capacidad de Las Municipalidades "; (4) "Capacidad de Las Organizaciones No&#13;
Gubernamentales "; (25) "Fondos Municipales Para El Manejo y Conservacidn de Los Recursos&#13;
Naturales"; (16) "Programa de Generaci6n y Transferencia de Tecnologia Para el Manejo&#13;
Sostenible de Recursos Naturales"; (28) "Reglamento Interno - Proyecto PROTIERRA; (18)&#13;
"Demanda de Microproyectos "; 'Asignaci6n de Recursos Para Inversirn Municipales",&#13;
'Municipal Funds", 'Municipal Finances and Decentralization"&#13;
2'    Implementation capacity, in terms of NGO and government's human resources also&#13;
shows a "lumpy" distribution in response to donor financing. (Abaunza, B.M., 1993. Las&#13;
Organizaciones No Gubernamentales En La Generaci6n y Transferencia de Tecnologia, pg. 12).&#13;
3'     The immaturity of existing examples makes impossible useful comparisons of the&#13;
efficiency of centralized vs decentralized models in Nicaragua, however, neither is it clear that&#13;
such analysis will be pertinent. Given that macroeconomic and public sector restructuring&#13;
policies demand a diminished role for central government the creation, implementation and&#13;
strengthening of decentralized mechanisms is unavoidable.&#13;

Background: The Policy and Institutional&#13;
Context for Decentralization&#13;

2. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
Local Government. The legal framework of municipal governments is&#13;
included in the Constitution, the Electoral Law, the Municipal Law, the Law of Political&#13;
Administrative Division and the regulations on the Organization and Operation of&#13;
Municipalities, approved by executive decree. The foundation for local government has&#13;
been until now the Municipal Law of 1988 (Ley de Municipios - Ley No. 40). This law&#13;
authorizes local government to provide services and exercise administrative authority over:&#13;
(1) environmental protection; (2) regulation of urban development and land use; (3) solid&#13;
waste management; (4) reforestation; (5) oversight of natural resource use and protection;&#13;
and (6) creation of mechanisms for popular participation in local decision-making. Several&#13;
larger and/or better funded municipal governments (e.g., Leon, Chinandega, El Castillo)&#13;
have begun to exercise these powers through the establishment of municipal environmental&#13;
offices, employing technical specialists, and creating environmental and natural resource&#13;
advisory committees. In a number of foreign donor-assisted projects as well, municipal&#13;
governments are beginning to function in their expanded roles.'4&#13;
The 1995 Partial Reform of the Constitution (Reforma Parcial de la&#13;
Constituci6n) brought important implications for local government. Key aspects of the&#13;
constitutional reform include: (1) regions were eliminated as administrative units with the&#13;
exception of the RAAS and RAAN; (2) municipal govermments were given broad&#13;
responsibilities over socio-economic (rural and urban) development within municipalities;&#13;
(3) municipal governments must now be consulted regarding natural resource use contracts&#13;
in their jurisdictions; (4) mayor, vice-mayor and councilors will all be elected directly for&#13;
a period of four years; and most importantly (5) a percentage of the national budget will be&#13;
fiscally transferred to those municipalities with lower resource mobilization potential.&#13;
Following the constitutional reform a new Municipal Law has been drafted that&#13;
would, inter alia, (1) regulate the election process; (2) more clearly define competencies&#13;
between municipal and central goverrnments; (3) commit the GON to transfer a percentage&#13;
of the national public budget to local governments according to pre-established ceilings.&#13;
IDA has kept an active dialogue with the GON on the decentralization process in the&#13;
context of the Institutional Development Credit and the preparation activities for the&#13;
proposed project. IDA has financed technical assistance on decentralization and local&#13;
public finance issues (see list of reports in project file in Annex 13).&#13;
3. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;

Decree 44-94) to propose and manage a national decentralization strategy. The SDC&#13;
forms part of the Executive Committee for Public Sector Reform (CERAP -- Comite&#13;
Ejecutivo para la Reforma de la Administraci6n Ptublica). The SDC is composed of the&#13;
President of INIFOM, who chairs the SDC, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of&#13;
Health, the Ministry of Education, the President of INAA and the Vice-Minister of the&#13;
Presidency for State Affairs. The SDC has defined seven overriding principles that should&#13;
guide the decentralization process: (1) public participation; (2) political conmmitment; (3)&#13;
gradual change; (4) capacity building and technical assistance; (5) transfer of resources;&#13;
(6) strong legal framework; and (7) restructuring and modemization of institutions. The&#13;
proposed IDA project would specifically target aspects (1), (3), (4), (5) and (6). The five&#13;
immediate tasks of the SDC are to: (1) propose a decentralization strategy; (2) propose&#13;
the reform to the Municipalities Law including in a system of fiscal transfers for&#13;
municipalities, to be approved by the National Assembly; (3) strengthen INIFOM; (4)&#13;
develop a plan of technical assistance and capacity building for municipalities; and (5)&#13;
implement and test local government models in pilot municipalities. During preparation of&#13;
the proposed IDA project some of these actions have been supported with preparation&#13;
funds and would continue to be supported during project implementation. The SDC has&#13;
already proposed the draft document for the reform to the Municipalities Law (which is an&#13;
integral part of the decentralization framework) which would define more precisely the&#13;
constitutional reforms introduced recently. Many of the line agencies (Education, Health,&#13;
Water, Natural Resources and Environment) are increasingly delegating implementation of&#13;
programs and projects to the local level.&#13;
This process is at a critical stage today due to the combination between the&#13;
weaknesses of local governments, particularly the rural ones, and the demands posed by&#13;
the decentralization process. Municipal governments are being given an ever increasing&#13;
role in the economy but for the most part are extremely weak in aspects of planning,&#13;
administrative and financial management, resource mobilization, delivery of public&#13;
services, cost recovery, and participatory processes. Thus while there is a new thrust&#13;
towards decentralization at the national level, rural local institutions are at a loss for&#13;
assuming their new roles. Capacity strengthening of local governments, including more&#13;
community participation, which is consistent with the decentralization agenda of GON,&#13;
must proceed at the same pace as the national decentralization agenda for it to be&#13;
successful.&#13;
INIFOM. The key institution in charge of municipal issues at the central&#13;
government level is the Nicaraguan Institute for Municipal Development (INIFOM; see&#13;
Chapter 2 of the SAR for a discussion of INIFOM). A recent study supported by IDA's&#13;
Institutional Development Credit identified the following main weaknesses in INIFOM:&#13;
(1) unclear role once decentralization is accomplished; (2) high number of managers&#13;
relative to professional staff, (3) lack of capacity to respond to municipal demands for&#13;
technical assistance and municipal studies; (4) conflictive roles in municipal development&#13;
and in municipal auditing and monitoring; (5) employment and career insecurity of&#13;
INIFOM staff; and (6) weak regional offices.&#13;
INIFOM has signed an Institutional Restructuring Agreement with CERAP in&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. Under the IRA, INIFOM agrees to implement the actions defined&#13;
&#13;

in the Reform of the Public Service under the general supervision of the General&#13;
Directorate of the Public Service and the financial reforms identified in the Integrated&#13;
System for Financial Management, Administration and Auditing under the supervision of&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. More specifically INIFOM agrees to implement the following&#13;
reforms during the next two years: (1) On Institutional Reform: (a) to define strategic&#13;
objectives and the institutional role; (b) to redesign the organizational structure; and (c) to&#13;
establish a system of monitoring and evaluation. (2) On Technical Capacity: (a) to put in&#13;
place management systems to assist the process of decentralization and municipal&#13;
governments; (b) to train staff on decentralization and municipal strengthening; and (c) to&#13;
develop instruments for coordinating donor financed projects. And on Office Technology:&#13;
to implement a plan for electronic management of databases.&#13;
Municipal Financing. One critical issue is municipal financing. Among&#13;
Central American countries, Nicaragua allocates the highest percentage of GDP to&#13;
municipal financing (3.0% for Nicaragua in 1989 as opposed to 2.4% for Honduras;&#13;
1.2% for Guatemala; 1.1% for Costa Rica (1990); and 0.7% for Panama (1987).&#13;
However in Nicaragua the fourteen more urbanized municipalities capture the lion's share&#13;
of municipal resources. These fourteen municipalities account for 75% of all municipal&#13;
expenditures, but include only 49% of the population. While an urban municipality spends&#13;
on average more than US$20.0 per capita per year the more rural ones invest less than&#13;
US$0.50 per capita per year. The revenue and expenditure gap between the larger and&#13;
more urbanized municipalities, usually larger towns where regional offices of central&#13;
government agencies and most services are concentrated, and smaller and rural ones is due&#13;
to distortions arising from the municipal financing system.&#13;
Ninety seven percent of all municipal revenues are generated through various&#13;
local taxes and fees. There are very limited central government fiscal transfers (3% of&#13;
total municipality revenues in 1992) and in the absence of fiscal transfers municipalities&#13;
must rely on programs of line agencies or specialized institutions such as the FISE over&#13;
which they have little control. In 1992 74% of municipal revenues originated from taxes&#13;
and fees with the bulk coming from (I) the sales tax (3 7%); (2) the property tax (6%); (3)&#13;
the vehicle tax (5%); (4) the business registration tax (8%); and (5) user charges and fees&#13;
(16%). Sales taxes and business registration taxes, in particular, are predominantly&#13;
collected in trading centers where businesses are located, usually cities and towns. Less&#13;
urbanized municipalities, which generate important productive activities in agriculture, see&#13;
these activities be indirectly taxed (namely through the 2 percent sales tax) by urban&#13;
municipalities but do not share in the revenues. As a result urban municipalities have much&#13;
larger investment expenditures per capita than rural ones, which do not have the means to&#13;
invest in the public services necessary for the productive sectors.&#13;
A background paper prepared in the course of project preparation5&#13;
recommends that in the area of municipal financing the GON should: (1) strengthen the&#13;
finances of municipalities with weak economic bases through a national revenue sharing&#13;
system; (2) consolidate the current revenue structure of local governments; (3) eliminate&#13;

Finances and Decentralization".&#13;

the 50% minimum limit on cost recovery of user fees and encourage sustainability through&#13;
full cost recovery policies; and (4) make explicit in the municipal law that municipalities&#13;
may pledge financial assets as guarantees for payrnent and make clear the rights of&#13;
creditors to seize financial assets. The draft Municipalities Law in the National Assembly&#13;
includes a Section on municipal financing proposing a revenue sharing mechanism to&#13;
compensate municipalities with a low revenue generation potential. The principle is that&#13;
GON would transfer a percentage of its revenues (4%) to municipalities according to a&#13;
formula reflecting population, poverty, area, participation effort and own revenue effort.&#13;
The transfers would be financed by reallocating resources from local development&#13;
programs currently channeled through INIFOM, National Assembly, MAS and Institute of&#13;
Sports. IDA supported background studies on this issue (see Annex 13).&#13;
4. LOCAL INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY&#13;
A. Local Governments&#13;
Project Municipalities&#13;
During preparation two evaluations of the capacity of the 32 municipalities&#13;
selected for the project were carried out. The first evaluation developed three typologies of&#13;
municipality-A, B, and C--according to their revenue resources mobilization capacity (see&#13;
Table Al. l), while the second evaluation focused on the adequacy of municipal financial&#13;
management (see Figure A 0. 1). These assessments led to the conclusion that municipal&#13;
govermnents have important weaknesses, some of them intrinsic to the nature of local&#13;
govemments, and others resulting from the particular Nicaraguan context:&#13;
*  financial weaknesses that results in part from the limited resources;&#13;
*  administrative weaknesses because of the lack of a professional career at&#13;
the municipal level which leads to a high tumover of personnel;&#13;
*  urban bias: municipal councils have a vast majority of representatives from&#13;
urban areas though the share of voters from urban and rural areas is&#13;
approximately the same in Nicaragua. Although an urban bias is efficient&#13;
because the cost per beneficiaries of service provision is lower when&#13;
beneficiaries are concentrated, in Nicaragua this bias is inflated by an&#13;
electoral process that does not link elected officials to voters in rural areas;&#13;
*  insufficient use of public consultation and participatory approaches;&#13;
*  limited planning capacity, due in part to technical weaknesses, and in part&#13;
to the lack of resources needed from planning exercises;&#13;
*  difficulties in intemalizing regional, national and global enviromental&#13;
concems due to the local nature of municipal jurisdictions;&#13;
*  weak legal framework for local public finance and lack of revenue sharing&#13;
mechanisms that benefit disadvantaged municipalities.&#13;

Institutional capacity. Municipal capacity is highly correlated with own&#13;
revenues. During project preparation a typology of municipalities was developed based on&#13;
this relationship (Table A 1.1). Within the 32 project municipalities already selected for&#13;
the project the capacity to assume increased responsibility over poverty natural resource&#13;
management and economic development ranges from "extremely limited" to "limited".&#13;
Le6n is the only exception. It is the only municipality with a medium-term, strategic&#13;
development plan and with the administrative, managerial and technical capacity to&#13;
implement it. After Le6n, in terms of administrative and technical ability and financial&#13;
status the municipality of Chinandega is the most capable. The remainder of municipal&#13;
govermnents are generally weak in financial, administrative and technical ability. They&#13;
have little capacity to generate income and make investments. They lack the necessary&#13;
technical resources, both in terms of human resources and basic equipment.&#13;

Existing capacity reflects the demands which have been placed on municipal&#13;
government. With few exceptions (e.g., Le6n and Chinandega), the vast majority of public&#13;
investments in social, productive, and environmental infrastructure and services are made&#13;
with funds which bypass municipalities. In the few cases where funds do pass through&#13;
municipal government, they are maintained outside municipal accounts and donors reserve&#13;
responsibility for accounting and oversight. As a result the most relevant weaknesses are&#13;
those related to financial administration and management. Without financial resources&#13;
there is little incentive to generate capacity for administration and management and without&#13;
administrative and managerial capacity it has been difficult to access and increase&#13;
financial resources.&#13;
Financial Management Experience. Municipalities do have experience (and&#13;
thus capacity) where they have been able to raise substantial local revenues. Total 1994&#13;
investment for development activities by government (local and national) 16 in project&#13;
municipalities was US$9.3 million (see Table Al.3). In the overwhelning majority of&#13;
cases investments in developmental activities were very modest and the funds managed by&#13;
municipal government represented only a small percentage of the total. A statistical&#13;
breakdown shows:&#13;
(1) a median investment per municipality of US$139,000; ranging from&#13;
US$36,000 (Cinco Pinos) to US$4.5 million (Le6n);&#13;
(2) a mean per capita investment of US$8.20; ranging from US$2.82&#13;
(Posoltega) to US$23.52 (Leon); and&#13;
(3) that funds generated by municipal governments accounted for 41% of&#13;
total investments; ranging in individual municipalities' contributions from&#13;
less than 1% to 72%. 50% of municipalities contributed less than 10%,&#13;
and 90% less than 25%.&#13;
All project municipalities have at least rudimentary financial accounting and&#13;
control systems (see Table Al .4 and Figure AIO. 1). About 70% of project municipalities&#13;
have their defined organizational structure completely staffed. Some 40% of them have&#13;
manuals of municipal government functions and 30% have terms-of-reference and manuals&#13;
of procedures for municipal employees. All but one project municipality maintains a set of&#13;
6' - "Development Activities" are defined here as those carried out either with municipal funds&#13;
or with funds that originate from the FISE or MAS, these latter representing transfers from&#13;
central government. Investments made through foreign donor's projects (bi-lateral, NGO, etc)&#13;
are not included here.&#13;

During preparation a detailed evaluation of the systems or financial control&#13;
within each of the 32 municipalities was carried out7. In each municipality procedures,&#13;
staff qualifications and practices were evaluated against the Bank's norms and guidelines&#13;
contained in the Financial Accounting, Reporting and Auditing Handbook (FARAH). The&#13;
results are sunmnarized in Table Al.4. The study was used to develop an indicator of&#13;
financial mnanagement standards which is presented in Annex I 0, Figure A I 0. 1. The study&#13;
also proposed an action plan, to be supported by the project, to bring financial controls up&#13;
to Bank standards.&#13;

Municipal Decision-Making. As entities responsible for raising their own&#13;
operating budgets, municipal governments have had to develop mechanisms for making&#13;
decisions which include some prioritization and conflict resolution functions. All&#13;
important decisions are made by the Municipal Council, which has ultimate authority. The&#13;
strength of the Municipal Councils, however, lies only in their role as a political decision&#13;
making body, i.e. they are not broadly representative of the municipal population's political&#13;
or socio-economic diversity. They are elected proportionally from political party lists&#13;
(which tend to head the lists with candidates from urban areas) with the result that a&#13;
disproportionate number of councilors are urban residents while rural and urban residents&#13;
vote in similar proportions. Roughly it was calculated that on average only 13% of&#13;
councilors reside in rural areas while rural populations contributed roughly 50% of all&#13;
votes. Hence Municipal Councils do not intemalize as well the concems of rural&#13;
communities as they do of urban ones and are not well positioned to initiate activities&#13;
directed at sustainable rural development, rural poverty the environment, and natural&#13;
resource management. This is further underscored in the majority of project municipalities&#13;
where the average level of educational attainment among the mayors and councils is low.&#13;
There is a rising comprehension in many rural based municipalities, however, that the only&#13;
a      The "Financial Management Indicator" was developed on the basis of 27 weighted&#13;
variables which assessed the accounting system, staff adequacy, internal auditing, and financial&#13;
management of the 32 municipalities&#13;
&#13;

viable source of municipality wealth and hence municipal revenues is the rural sector.&#13;
There is thus a renewed effort to develop municipal programs to support further&#13;
development of rural based activities often seen as a source of local taxes, although there is&#13;
very limited technical capacity to design and implement such programs.&#13;
Civic society participation in municipal decision-making. Informal mechanisms&#13;
which function to enhance participation in the decision-making process exist in the&#13;
majority of project municipalities. (see Table A1.5). The majority of municipalities also&#13;
have some type of organized "Community Development" committees. A special case with&#13;
a large impact are the Local Development Committees (LDC) created by the Ministry of&#13;
Social Affairs (MAS). LDCs are local structures made of sometimes elected and&#13;
sometimes non-elected community representatives and notables (priest, teacher, etc.) that&#13;
propose local investment priorities for public financing. LDCs are a controversial&#13;
initiative among municipal governments for two reasons: (1) there has been little financial&#13;
support for the investments identified by LDCs and thus some people claim that LDCs&#13;
have lost clout and there is some participation fatigue as the initial efforts led to limited&#13;
results; and (2) LDCs are a structure that is parallel to and substitutes for decision-making&#13;
functions of local government (municipal council), hence often are ignored by them.&#13;

B. Non-Government Organizations (NGOs).&#13;
Typology of NGOs. Capacity among local NGOs is critical to the feasibility&#13;
of devolving greater responsibility to the local level (see Table Al.6). NGOs play an&#13;
extremely imnportant role in most phases of local development and they control substantial&#13;
human and financial resources.19 NGOs are required to have a legal identity (personalidad&#13;
jurdica) and under the law are considered as civic, non-profit organizations.&#13;
Associations and cooperatives (such as for producers) take their legal form and identity&#13;
through the regulations enforced by the Direcci6n de Cooperativas in the Ministry of&#13;
Labor. NGOs operating within the project area can be divided into four types: (1)&#13;
national-level NGOs created before 1990; (2) national-level and local-level NGOs created&#13;
since 1990; (3) associations with local coverage; and (4) projects administered by foreign&#13;
donors that convert into NGOs:&#13;
(1) National-Level NGOs Created Before 1990 includes FUNDE, FACS,&#13;
CEPAD, CEPRODEL and CAPRI; all of which manage a diverse&#13;
portfolio of programs that include: social assistance, sustainable&#13;
development, environment, gender, child care, and emergency&#13;
response/disaster relief. Since 1990 they have all been implementing&#13;
credit programs for financing productive activities. Since 1992 they have&#13;
all also added "green" emphases to their programs.&#13;
(2) National and Local-Level NGOs Created Since 1990 developed&#13;
primarily specific thematic areas such as woman-in-development, child&#13;
care, human rights, sustainable development, environment, etc. Examples&#13;
of national-level NGOs of this type include: CIPRES which implements&#13;
sustainable development projects, and NITLAPLAN which specializes in&#13;
credit intermediation to small and medium farmers. There are numerous&#13;
examnples of local-level NGOs; as a group they have diverse roots both&#13;
within the municipalities (e.g. SELVA an environmental NGO which&#13;
operates only in one municipality) and outside (e.g. Fundaci6n Le6n 2000,&#13;
an NGO which developed out of a central government agency program).&#13;
The majority of these NGOs provide services to projects, responding to&#13;
those areas in which financing is available.&#13;
(3) Associations With Local Coverage are organizations with a membership&#13;
consisting of individual farmers or farmer cooperatives. The latter type&#13;
are second-level associations or cooperative unions (e.g., UNAG,&#13;
UROCOOM, and UCOOM) whose clients are service and credit&#13;
cooperatives and multi-sectoral cooperatives. They tend to specialize in&#13;
facilitation of credit and marketing. The former provide a range of&#13;
9' - According to a PRIAG study (Abaunza, B.M., 1993. Las Organizaci6nes No&#13;
Gubernamentales En La Generaci6n y Transferencia de Tecnologia), Nicaraguan NGOs may&#13;
currently be providing services to about 70,000 households and managing as much as US$ 100&#13;
million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Background: The Policy and Institutional&#13;
Context for Decentralization&#13;

services (e.g., credit, training, extension, and marketing) but only to&#13;
affiliated individuals. Many affiliates are farmers who have been&#13;
"saneados" for failure to repay loans and are thus no longer creditworthy.&#13;
Few women have had access to the associations' credit programs and, as&#13;
a result, there is a growing move toward the establishment of women's&#13;
associations (e.g. APROAL in Le6n).&#13;
(4) Foreign Donor Projects That Convert Into NGOs include the projects&#13;
Manual L6pez and CHINORTE (now, "Fondo Del Desarrollo") which&#13;
now remain as NGOs with a regional coverage. Their programs tend to&#13;
cover health, potable water, women-in-development, and natural resource&#13;
management. They also provide credit, acting as intermediaries for both&#13;
state and private banks.&#13;
NGO Activities. The activities of the NGOs working within the project area&#13;
fall within the following categories (see Table Al.6):&#13;
(1) sustainable development programs - directed toward small farmers in the&#13;
dry and humid tropics, offering technical options to overcome production&#13;
constraints (e.g. improved seed, soil and moisture conservation, soil&#13;
fertility management);&#13;
(2) micro-enterprise development - primarily credit intermediation programs,&#13;
these tend to be urban-based programs with little rural presence;&#13;
(3) credit intermediation - stand alone projects which operate communal&#13;
banks, cajas rurales, etc.&#13;
(4) agricultural credit - cooperative programs for production and marketing of&#13;
basic grains and some few, other agricultural commodities;&#13;
(5) environmental education - generally oriented toward the promotion of&#13;
improved farming and land use practices; and&#13;
(6) women's programs - these tend to focus on micro-activities (e.g. chickens&#13;
and pigs) at the household-level; there is an incipient trend (e.g. APROAL&#13;
and UNAG/Chinandega) to recognize women's wider roles in the economy&#13;
and environment and provide a broader range of opportunities than the&#13;
current.&#13;
NGO Capacity. With little exception NGOs are highly dependent on funding&#13;
from foreign donors; the exceptions are the credit intermediaries and those that sell&#13;
services (technical assistance, training, marketing). Neither national governrnent nor local&#13;
philanthropists are a significant source of financing. As a result, the national-level NGOs&#13;
have had a good deal of experience in proposal writing and competitive fund-raising with&#13;
foreign donors. The local NGOs have much less experience in these areas, mostly due to a&#13;
lack of infornation about funding sources and their individual requirements.&#13;

The national NGOs established before 1990 exhibit a higher level of&#13;
institutional capacity for financial management of projects. They maintain computerized&#13;
accounting systems and have well-established, professional sources from which to solicit&#13;
institutional assistance. They are also becoming self-sufficient in terms of recurrent costs,&#13;
though as yet this does not signify an ability to cover basic administrative costs with their&#13;
own funds. Having developed the capacity to access multi-lateral funds (e.g., from IDB&#13;
and EU), they have also had to develop professional systems for project administration and&#13;
monitoring. As a normal routine, they maintain project funds and the NGO's personal&#13;
funds in separate bank accounts, keep up-to-date financial and accounting records, and&#13;
submit themselves to annual external audits. The national NGOs established since 1990&#13;
also tend to exhibit a reasonable level of institutional capacity, though less advanced given&#13;
their shorter institutional life.&#13;
The majority of the local NGOs created since 1990 demonstrate potential, but&#13;
as yet their admninistrative capacity is limited. Their weakest area tends to be accounting&#13;
systems. As noted above, due to the lack of resources for institutional strengthening the&#13;
development of capabilities in these areas has lagged behind. The exception to this has&#13;
been those NGOs (e.g. Fundaci6n Le6n 2000) which developed out of central government&#13;
programs where capacity building funds were provided.&#13;
The associations with local coverage could be characterized as having a&#13;
capacity lying somewhere between that of the national and local NGOs. The second-level&#13;
associations maintain professional accounting and administrative personnel at their central&#13;
offices. Where the problems occur is at the level of the cooperatives and groups with&#13;
whom they work. At this level the lack of formal education and resources with which to&#13;
contract specialized personnel translates into minimal administrative and accounting&#13;
capabilities. The problems are exacerbated by the absence of any standardized accounting&#13;
systems and minimal access to training. Where exceptions exist, i.e., in the larger&#13;
cooperatives that can afford to hire personnel with more education and experience, the lack&#13;
of resources for training and office equipment (e.g., computers) is an obstacle.&#13;
As regards the NGOs arising out of foreign donor projects, they are well-&#13;
trained and professionally equipped, particularly in those cases such as CHINORTE where&#13;

an effort was made to leave adequate installed capacity for fund management following&#13;
project closure.&#13;
C. Local Technical Capacity for Natural Resources Management&#13;
On-going Projects. There are a number of initiatives in the project areas&#13;
directed at improving agricultural productivity. In the Pacific area, there are two&#13;
important bilaterally financed projects (Proyecto Pikin Guerrero (NORAD) and Proyecto&#13;
de los Maribios (Netherlands financed, FAO executed)) aimed at developing sustainable&#13;
agricultural technology in the buffer zone around and on the lower slopes of the Maribios,&#13;
the chain of volcanos that runs parallel to the coast a little to the north-west of Le6n and&#13;
Chinandega towns, and a third one (FINNIDA financed) that aims more specifically at&#13;
reforestation, to establish windbreaks and thus reduce wind erosion. In the Caribbean,&#13;
there are two main groups working in the field of agricultural technology. One, an NGO&#13;
"CIPRES" which has substantial experience with soil management (fertility and erosion&#13;
control) for small farmers and the other, a bi-lateral project (Dutch-financed) "PRODES"&#13;
which has its own research station and outreach program in Nueva Guinea, where it is&#13;
developing alternative production systems for the area. Other foreign-financed projects of&#13;
interest are DANIDAIManglares (developing mangrove management techniques in the&#13;
Estero Real), and CATIE/MADELENA (applied forestry research and demonstrations for&#13;
fuelwood, poles and timber production).&#13;
Technology Transfer. INTA provides rather limited extension services to&#13;
small and medium-scale farmers, and, in keeping with Government's policy to achieve the&#13;
gradual privatization of the research and extension agencies, a growing part of these must&#13;
be provided by the private sector. Presently, INTA fields about 50 technical specialists&#13;
and 200 extensionists countrywide; in the project area in the Pacific zone there are a total&#13;
of about 24 extensionists covering 11 municipalities&#13;
A study no of 88 entities (NGOs, projects, universities, institutions) active in&#13;
natural resource management found that over 60% of them worked in the promotion of soil&#13;
conservation and fertility management. The main technical offerings in these areas were&#13;
live barriers, organic fertilizers, green manure crops, contour cultivation and reforestation.&#13;
Only 21% of these worked directly with agricultural production, though this primarily&#13;
implied improved seed and provision of hand tools. Other activities (e.g., family gardens,&#13;
IPM, forest and fruit tree nurseries and small irrigation) were promoted by 13% of the&#13;
entities studied. Only 4% assisted with commercialization of farm products. One of the&#13;
main weaknesses identified by the study was the lack of training for technical personnel;&#13;
the overwhelming majority of resources for training were directed toward farmers and&#13;
fanner/technicians.&#13;
The number of natural resource technical specialists and professionals&#13;
(agronomists, agriculturalists, livestock specialists, foresters, biologists, botanists,&#13;
ecologists etc) in the project areas (Pacific and Caribbean zones) is uncertain. Best&#13;

estimates range between 250 and 350 for the total number of governnent, private sector,&#13;
and NGO technical specialists in the project's regions. An FAO study "1 found among&#13;
688 employees in 9 NGOs that only some 5% were natural resource professionals. The&#13;
PRIAG study (see cite in footnote #4) covered 18 NGOs that were estimated to account&#13;
for about 75% of technology transfer activities in the non-government sector. Between&#13;
them these 18 NGOs employed 668 persons which 119 were natural resource professionals&#13;
(50% with licenciatura and 50% tecnicos medios). In addition, these 18 were supporting&#13;
a network of 1,170 rural promoters who worked directly with an estimated 11,000 to&#13;
15,000 families. The number of natural resource technical specialists outside of&#13;
government is assumed to have risen significantly over the last two years since these&#13;
studies were completed. Restructuring of the public sector has been steadily reducing the&#13;
number of positions in government.&#13;
The Non-Government Sector. A great deal of capacity exists within the&#13;
NGO sector, however, it also tends to be dispersed and can be quite variable in quality. In&#13;
general terms NGOs' main weaknesses lie in their administrative, project formnulation,&#13;
project analysis and natural resource technical skills. In terms of logistical support, the&#13;
NGOs are relatively better off than the majority of the municipal governments.&#13;
Weaknesses in extension methodologies have been noted among a large percentage of the&#13;
NGOs which provide extension and other training activities to small farmers. These&#13;
include:&#13;
(1) little experience with use of participatory diagnostic tools for problem&#13;
identification and proposal development;&#13;
(2) limited understanding of the technical limits (physical, biological,&#13;
chemical) to the technical menu they promote;&#13;
(3) frequent improper application of the technical menu (e.g. poor species/site&#13;
matching, improperly planted and spaced vegetative barriers; mis-&#13;
application of organic inputs, etc);&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
BACKGROUND: NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES AND THE PROJECT AREA!'&#13;
1. NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES&#13;
Nicaragua is a country known both for its large areas of still pristine forests,&#13;
watercourses and coral reefs in the Atlantic and for a high level of resource degradation in the&#13;
Pacific, Northem and Central regions. Underlying most of the resource degradation are&#13;
misguided policies, extreme poverty, the civil war and migratory pressures due to the war and&#13;
other factors. The Atlantic region has so far escaped these pressures due to poor access, low&#13;
population density and the war period during which various armed groups sought refuge in its&#13;
forests. The situation is changing however and pressure from refugees, landless farmers and&#13;
legitimate development needs are accelerating the advance of the agricultural frontier.&#13;
Soils&#13;
While soil erosion is considered to be the most important cause of soil degradation&#13;
on a national level, other phenomena may be as or more important on a local scale (i.e.&#13;
compactation, salinization, acidification, and sodification). Erosion by water is the main&#13;
process of interest, wind erosion is also important in numerous (specific) locations throughout&#13;
the westem half of the country. About 7.7 million ha are affected by erosion, of which 52% is&#13;
classified as having light to moderate erosion; 33% as having moderate to high erosion; and&#13;
15% as high to severe erosion. The main causes of accelerated erosion are: (1) deforestation;&#13;
(2) lack of integration of conservation practices into land use practices (including roads); (3)&#13;
rapid, uncontrolled expansion of annual cropping and livestock over the last 30 years; and (4)&#13;
inappropriate land uses.&#13;
At a national level, drops in yield have been noted and ascribed to erosion. Little&#13;
empirical evidence exists though one study found a yield decline in com of 82% over a 9 year&#13;
period as a result of soil loss (NEAP/NIC, 1994). Areas identified as having priority&#13;
erosion/soil degradation problems are: (1) the southern watershed of Managua; (2) the foothills&#13;
of the San Cristobal, Chonco and Casita volcanic complex; (3) the foothills of Volcan&#13;
Cosiguina; (4) Le6n - La Paz Centro areas; (5) south slope of the Meseta de Carazo; (6)&#13;
Volcan Mombacho and adjacent areas; (7) the plains in the Tipitapa - Granada area; (8) the&#13;
northwestern portion of the Rio Coco watershed; (9) the Jalapa Valley; and (10) the Nueva&#13;
Guinea area.&#13;
Forests&#13;
Since 1950 forest cover has been reduced from 7 million hectares to an estimated&#13;
4.3 million hectares (TFAP, 1992). In 1985, one author (Peters, 1985) estimnated the rate of&#13;
1' - For a more complete treatment of the subject, see Project Working Papers: (29) "Ordenamiento&#13;
Ambiental del Territorio (PROTIERRA) - Problemasy Recomendaciones",.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

deforestation to be 0.1 million ha/yr. Other authors estimates range from between 0.07 million&#13;
ha/yr in 1990 (Utting, 1993) to about 0.125 million ha/yr for the period 1981 to 1990 (FAO,&#13;
1993) and 1991 (Merlet et al, 1993). According to the NEAP (1994) this rate has increased in&#13;
the last few years to 0.15 million ha/yr. Land classified as suitable only for forestry usage&#13;
occupies about 6.2 million ha; divided as 1.8 million ha for conservation and 4.4 million ha for&#13;
sustainable use. Some 2.5 million hectares of these lands are deforested and being used for&#13;
extensive livestock production or are abandoned and under mixed grass/shrubs. Of the&#13;
remaining forest areas about 88% or 3.8 million hectares consists of a humid, tropical forest&#13;
cover type with which there is very little positive management experience to draw upon.&#13;
The main value of forests in Nicaragua has been in its conversion to agriculture.&#13;
As such, the "expansion of the agricultural frontier" is reported to be the principle cause of&#13;
deforestation. The greatest pressures are apparently in the Atlantic and parts of the Central&#13;
zone. At current rates it is estimated that only 10 to 15 years would be required to eliminate&#13;
the remaining areas of productive broadleaf forests (NEAP, 1994). The end of the war and&#13;
return of peace to the near-forest zones and demobilization of a large number of soldiers (both&#13;
government and contras) in recent years has apparently contributed significantly to an increase&#13;
in the rate of conversion. The expansion of agricultural lands and forest conversion also have&#13;
roots which lie in: (1) lack of economic incentives for forest management; (2) low productivity&#13;
and non-sustainable agricultural practices; (3) poorly defined or missing land tenure; (4) lack&#13;
of alternate employment; (5) a strong agricultural tradition in which forests are considered an&#13;
obstacle; and (6) little or no tradition of forest management.&#13;
The traditional system for forest management in Nicaragua has been to remove&#13;
only the valuable species with no subsequent consideration of damage to the residual stand or&#13;
for follow up management and/or control. In this system forest was not treated as a renewable&#13;
resource, it was simply mined for its value. There are very few examples in the country of&#13;
forest management for long term production. In addition, information to manage the forests is&#13;
generally lacking. The forests and lands which belong to the state have never been defined or&#13;
delimited. National and regional trend data on forest cover and forest use is lacking.&#13;
Management data on forest resource abundance, distribution and regenerative capacity is&#13;
almost completely missing.&#13;
In 1992 about 60% of net energy consumption came from fuelwood (57%) and&#13;
charcoal (1 %); almost 99% of which went for residential use (NEAP/NIC, 1994). According&#13;
to the TFAP (1992), wood fuel represented about 95% of the average US$ 148.8 million&#13;
annual value of forestry products in the early 1990s. Whether or not fuelwood harvesting&#13;
constitutes a forest degrading activity in some locations is unknown. What is certain is that&#13;
fuelwood production and harvesting is unmanaged and risks exist of it becoming a forest&#13;
degrading activity. Harvesting and sales of wood fuels constitutes a significant income&#13;
generating activity among the rural poor. Fuelwood is in short supply near densely populated&#13;
urban centers and prices have been reported as being high. However, near densely populated&#13;
areas in the Pacific zone (i.e. Le6n) there are indications that fuelwood is currently priced as if&#13;
it were abundant. Given the large areas of land being allowed to reconvert to woody&#13;
vegetation, fuelwood may indeed be abundant.&#13;
&#13;

Fire is apparently a problem in a large number of areas where recurrent burning&#13;
(primarily for agricultural purposes) is a major contributor to forest degradation and failure of&#13;
reforestation efforts.&#13;
Water&#13;
Inappropriate land uses, lack of a regulatory framework and inadequate protection&#13;
(e.g. effluent and solid waste treatment, control of contaminants, provision and enforcement of&#13;
penalties/incentives, etc) have all contributed to a deterioration of the nation's water resources.&#13;
Problems are further intensified by a lack of planming and subsequent conflicts over water&#13;
allocation (e.g. between hydroelectric and irrigation). Specific, priority issues include scarcity,&#13;
watershed management and water quality.&#13;
Scarcity. The Pacific side and Central Zones receive the least rainfall and&#13;
commonly, both their rural and urban areas are characterized as suffering water supply&#13;
deficits. Conflict over water allocation appear certain to increase given the desire to expand&#13;
irrigated areas and divert water for economic development (e.g. agroprocessing facilities).&#13;
Drought in some degree is not infrequent in many parts of the Pacific and Central zones and&#13;
the current farming systems, particularly of the small farmers appear to be extremely&#13;
vulnerable to drought. Land use practices which decrease the infiltration of rainfall (e.g.&#13;
frequent burning, up-and-down slope cultivation, etc) may be contributing to reductions in&#13;
groundwater and of surface water low flows on some local scale. Other factors contributing to&#13;
the deficits undoubtedly include population increases with little or no parallel investment in&#13;
upgrading of water systems and in some areas of the Pacific zone possibly includes&#13;
uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater.&#13;
Watershed management. Watersheds which have been identified as requiring&#13;
management for production of surface water include: Managua - Rio Mico; Matagalpa - Rios&#13;
San Francisco and Molino Norte; San Rafael del Sur - Rio Jesus; Nueva Guinea - Rio Zapote;&#13;
Ocotal - Rio Dipilto; Boaco - Rio Fonseca; and Puerto Cabezas - Rios Taupi and Braquiria.&#13;
Those identified as requiring management for groundwater include: Chinandega - Rio Acome;&#13;
Santo Tomas - Rio Cuipar; and Bluefields - Rio Escofran.&#13;
Potable water. About 20% of the rural population versus 79% of the urban&#13;
population have access to potable water (NEAP, 1994). In comparative terns, the percentage&#13;
of persons with access to potable water in Nicaragua is the lowest in Central America. Over&#13;
80% of rural households suffer from contaminated water (World Bank, 1992. SAR Social&#13;
Investment Fund)&#13;
Water quality. There are no systematic data regarding water quality therefore a&#13;
comprehensive overview of the problems cannot be given. What is known about the&#13;
dimensions of water quality consists of:&#13;
(1) Lake Managua. The lake comprises the worst case of contamination in the&#13;
country. Apart from the natural salinization process which the lake is&#13;
undergoing, other causes of diminishing water quality include: the direct&#13;
discharge of sewage, industrial wastes, agrochemicals (both from use and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Background: Natural Resources Issues and the Project Area&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
manufacture), effluents from the Momotombo Geothermal Plant, garbage&#13;
dumping on the lakeshores and sediment inflows. It is estimated that over 40&#13;
tons of mercury have been discharged into the lake in the last 20 years. Other&#13;
lakes reportedly suffering from serious contamination include the Lagunas&#13;
Tiscapa and Masaya. Water quality of Lake Managua is being handled&#13;
through an IDB project currently under preparation.&#13;
(2) Industrial contamination. One of the potentially most serious problems in&#13;
the country is associated with Laguna Asososca, which is an important water&#13;
supply for Managua. Apparently the laguna receives water from the aquifer&#13;
which lies below the industrial zone between Laguna Asososca and Lake&#13;
Managua. The aquifer has been contarninated by industrial discharges thus&#13;
affecting water quality in the laguna. Relatively good data exists on the&#13;
physico-chemical and bacteriological status of the laguna.&#13;
(3) Agrochemical contamination. The high rates of pesticide usage in some&#13;
agricultural areas, especially the (current and past) cotton growing areas, has&#13;
resulted in agrochemical residues in both groundwater and surface water. In&#13;
the Pacific zone around Chinandega, El Viejo, El Realejo y Le6n levels of&#13;
nitrate nitrogen in groundwater exceed 40 mg/It (or 4 times the amount&#13;
allowed in the United States). In the Pacific and Central zones, the&#13;
agrochemical contamination of surface water is reported for the rivers Esteli,&#13;
Grande de Matalgalpa, Jinotega-Apanas, Acome, Chiquito, Oro, Fonseca,&#13;
Mayales and San Juan. The Jinotega and Matagalpa rivers, in addition,&#13;
receive significant levels of direct discharges from coffee processing.&#13;
(4) Sediment. Accelerated erosion caused by inappropriate land use practices is&#13;
reported in all parts of the country. No empirical data is available. Impacts&#13;
are reported in all estuaries, lakes and river courses. Sediments would be a&#13;
major vehicle for transport of agro-chemicals to water bodies.&#13;
(5) Urban Areas. Fecal contamination, non-point source pollution from&#13;
agriculture, industrial effluents and deficiencies in the wastewater systems are&#13;
the main problems. Managua, among all urban areas, has the greatest&#13;
problems.&#13;
(6) Mining. The rivers Tunky (or Sucio), Mico, Maiz and Tecomapa are&#13;
reported to be contaminated by cyanide and other heavy metals as a result of&#13;
mining and processing activities.&#13;
(7) Saltwater intrusion. Overexploitation of groundwater in some of the westem&#13;
parts of the country (e.g. Chichigalpa, Chinandega, Corinto, and Poneloya)&#13;
has caused saltwater intrusion as far as I Okm inland from the coast.&#13;

Coastal Zone and Fisheries&#13;
In Nicaragua three of Central America's five largest rivers feed a unique system of&#13;
bays and lagoons which serve as critical breeding habitat for major commercial species (e.g.&#13;
shrimp and lobster). On the Pacific side, sedimentation and agrochemical residues (e.g. in&#13;
Estero Real in the Gulf of Fonseca) are potentially effecting the wild shrimp populations which&#13;
breed in these waters. On the Caribbean side rich coral and sea grass resources (one of the&#13;
largest sea grass areas in the world) exist which are habitat for the endangered manatee and&#13;
almost one-half of the Atlantic's population. The commercial and biodiversity values of these&#13;
areas are perhaps the highest in Central America. Priority issues include the fishery, shrimp&#13;
culture and mangroves:&#13;
Fishery. Fishing pressures are known to be increasing while adequate data is not&#13;
available either on the magnitude of the catch nor on the carrying capacity of the resource.&#13;
The fishery is little diversified and thus the majority of fishing efforts are concentrated on a&#13;
few species (sea bass, lobster, green sea turtle, shark and red snapper). There is some&#13;
indication that the shrimp catch along the Pacific coast and the lobster catch along the&#13;
Caribbean have reached their limits. In addition, the unregulated use of fish traps and the high&#13;
loss of non-target species caused by shrimper's nets are thought to be significant factors&#13;
contributing to the observed declines in marine fauna populations.&#13;
Shrimp culture. The expansion of shrimp culture is thought to have little&#13;
scientific base and to potentially be destroying coastal habitat with unknown effects on zones&#13;
which are extremely important as breeding grounds for both marine and avifauna. It is feared&#13;
that uncontrolled expansion of shrimp culture will begin along the Caribbean coast in those&#13;
areas which are critical breeding habitat for six commercial species of (wild) shrimp.&#13;
Mangroves. The main area of mangrove loss is along the Pacific coast. The&#13;
losses are the results of: (a) harvesting fuelwood and timber for local use; and (b) shrimp&#13;
culture, both from clearing and ponds creating changes in water levels and salinity.&#13;
Biodiversity&#13;
Less is known about the biodiversity values of Nicaragua than any other Central&#13;
American country. Ten principal ecosystems have been identified and described; the&#13;
identification work, however, is not necessarily complete. Information on biota is highly&#13;
uneven. Some 1,200 species or an estimated 95% of vertebrates have been identified, whereas&#13;
an estimated 65% of plant species have been identified (8,550 species with 56 endemic&#13;
species). The list of saltwater fish (311 Pacific species and 305 Atlantic species), mollusks&#13;
(2,000 species), corals (42 species), and plants (107 algae species and 5 sea grasses) and of&#13;
freshwater fish (46 species with II endemic) is considered to be almost complete. The lists of&#13;
terrestrial invertebrates is extremely weak and the only insect and mycological information&#13;
available is on those with economic importance to the agricultural sector. Specific, priority&#13;
issues include loss of biodiversity, habitat loss and protected areas.&#13;
Loss of biodiversity. The primary causes of species and ecosystem loss are the&#13;
same as those driving deforestation with the addition of conmmercial harvesting pressures to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;

supply a growing local and intemational market with specimens and products from wildlife. It&#13;
is estimated that 2% of terrestrial vertebrates are in danger of extinction and 10% are currently&#13;
threatened. The agricultural frontiers to the north and east are the most dynamic zones of loss.&#13;
Habitat loss. The overwhelming majority of tropical dry forest habitat has already&#13;
been lost as these areas were the initial zones cleared for livestock and some annual crop&#13;
cultivation. Only remnants of this forest type still exist within the Pacific zone. Little&#13;
information is available on mangrove habitat and trends in loss. Pressure on mangrove may be&#13;
increasing in the westem coastal zone areas near the Honduran border where development of&#13;
shrimp culture is of interest (Coastal resources).&#13;
Protected areas. Within the approximately 3.4 million hectares of land which&#13;
have undergone little modification from human influences there are about 2 million hectares&#13;
which are considered in the NEAP to be worthy of protection within the protected areas&#13;
system. To date over 85% of this 2 million hectares lies within 71 legally constituted protected&#13;
areas; legally constituted by presidential decrees, not by a protected areas system law. Among&#13;
these 71 areas are: a) 0.06 million hectares under active protection and/or management; b) 0.25&#13;
million hectares under some minimal protection scheme; and iii) the remainder without&#13;
management plans, without management activities of any kind, and without any personnel to&#13;
guard or monitor the area. The other 1.4 million hectares are classified as production forest or&#13;
potential agricultural lands. Under the General Environrnent Law of 1996 new protected areas&#13;
will need to be approved by law.&#13;
2. LEGISLATION, STRATEGIES AND INSTITUTIONS&#13;
Legal Framework&#13;
The national environmental action plan (neap) notes that the laws and policies&#13;
governing ownership and use of natural resources are out-dated, disjointed and incoherent.&#13;
The most critical need is passage of legislation and/or regulations covering eleven natural&#13;
resources and related themes: environment, forestry, mining, fisheries, biodiversity, protected&#13;
areas, pollution, water, soil conservation, coastal zone management, indigenous land and&#13;
natural resources issues, and municipal and autonomous governments. Nicaragua has made&#13;
important efforts to rationalize the legal framework for natural resources; the general&#13;
environment law was ratified by the national assembly in April 1996. Various laws are in&#13;
draft form or already under discussion in the national assembly (the fisheries law, the mining&#13;
law, the energy law and the pollution law).&#13;
Natural Resources Strategies&#13;
In spite of the legislative bottlenecks noted above, some progress has been made&#13;
recently in developing a national strategy for the environment and natural resources:&#13;
Presidential Decree 246-92 approved (1) the National Forestry Action Plan (TFAP); (2) the&#13;
National Strategy for Conservation and Sustainable Development (ECODESNIC); (3) the&#13;
Strategy for Environment and Land Use Planning (EOAT). The National Environmental&#13;
Action Plan (NEAP) was approved by Presidential Decree 261-93 on December 3, 1993.&#13;
&#13;

Between them, these plans and strategies provide a reasonable framework within which&#13;
priorities have been established for investment and institutional development and that is&#13;
consistent with the decentralization agenda to be supported (see Table A2. 1).&#13;

Rural Development. The National Agricultural Council (CONAGRO) was&#13;
created in 1993 by presidential decree to coordinate policies and activities between the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture, the Institute of Natural Resources (IRENA, now MARENA), and the&#13;
Institutes of Agrarian Reforn and Agricultural Technology (INRA and INTA). Since 1994&#13;
CONAGRO has grown in importance, having assumed the role of key coordinating GON&#13;
structure for rural development and has placed high on its agenda issues relating to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;

management of natural resources. INRA (Instituto Nicaraguense de Reforma Agraria) is the&#13;
institution in charge of titling lands. It is being supported by the IDA's Agricultural&#13;
Technology and Land Titling and Land Management Project (Credit No.2536-NI) and plans&#13;
during the project to award about 25,000 titles in the Pacific, Northern and Central regions.&#13;
INTA (Instatuto Nicaraguense de Tecnologia Agropecuaria) is the institution in charge of&#13;
research and extension. It is also being supported by IDA Credit No. The PNDR (Programa&#13;
Nacional de Desarollo Rural) was recently created as a result of an IDB project of the same&#13;
name. The focus of the PNDR was initially on the Central region of Nicaragua, but since then&#13;
it has absorbed various donor financed rural development projects that were spread out&#13;
through several institutions, namely MAG and MARENA. MAG has seen its role weakened&#13;
following the proliferation of specialized institutes and programs. A draft Law on the&#13;
Organization, Competencies and Procedures of the Executive Branch of Government (Proyecto&#13;
de Ley de Organizaci6n, Competencias y Procedimientos del Poder Ejecutivo) is being&#13;
discussed in the National Assembly. In this law the proposed mission of the MAG would be&#13;
(1) to manage the agriculture development policy; (2) to promote crop diversification; (3) to&#13;
develop agriculture crop zoning; (4) to cooperate in plans and programs for environmental&#13;
protection; (5) to establish agricultural schools; (6) to promote the competitiveness of&#13;
agricultural production; (6) to collaborate in industrialization and commercialization of&#13;
agricultural products; and (7) to manage fitosanitary controls.&#13;
Natural Resources and Environment. In January 1994, a new Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) was created out of the former IRENA by&#13;
Presidential Decree 1-94. It now has the authority to: (1) coordinate and direct all public&#13;
policy towards natural resources; (2) promote sustainable use of natural resources; and (3) to&#13;
propose laws, regulations, standards and strategies for sustainable use and protection of&#13;
natural resources and the environment through participatory processes. Currently, MARENA&#13;
is, together with INIFOM, one of the first six institutions of Government participating in the&#13;
reestructuring contemplated in the Institutional Development Credit. This credit would support&#13;
the streamlining of MARENA and the strengthening of its basic functions including financial&#13;
management, functional structure and personnel and administration. Recommendations&#13;
already under implementation include the reorganization of the Ministry into three inter-&#13;
disciplinary directorates (Policy and Strategy, Regulation and Control, and Interinstitutional&#13;
Relations) and the devolution of some natural resource projects to the PNDR and&#13;
municipalities, along with appropriate technical assistance to strengthen municipal capacity.&#13;
The main activities to be financed by the Institutional Development Credit are the following:&#13;
(1) institutional reorganization including redefinition of mission, objectives, functions,&#13;
organization and administrative procedures; (2) implementing a system for coordinating&#13;
externally financed projects; (3) improvement of project management; and (4) develop and&#13;
implement a strategy for information technology. In 1996 a new General Environment Law&#13;
created the National Environment Comnuission, headed by MARENA, in charge of&#13;
coordinating environmental activities and an Environment Fund, to channel resources for the&#13;

Enforcement Agencies. The General Environment Law of 1996 created an Office&#13;
of Environmental Affairs in the General Attomey's Office. Additionally, prior to this legal&#13;
development which has not yet materialized with the necessary appointments and funding the&#13;
Armed Forces and the National Police have been assuming an increasing role in matters of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

environmental and natural resources legislation. The Armed Forces includes in its statutes&#13;
(C6digo de Organizaci6n, Jurisdiccion y Previsi6n Social Militar; Ley 181 de 02.09.94)&#13;
supporting the branches of the executive with natural resource conservation and renovation,&#13;
improving the environment and ecological equilibrium and collaborating in the strategic plans&#13;
established by the President, which include the Tropical Forestry Action Plan and the National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan. In March 1995 MARENA and the Armed Forces signed an&#13;
interinstitutional agreement (Convenci6n Interinstitucionalpara la Conservac6n delMedio&#13;
Ambiente y Uso Sostenible de los Recursos Naturales MARENA-EPS, 29 de Marzo de 1995)&#13;
which defines the areas and mechanisms of coordination between the two institutions. Under&#13;
this agreement the Armed Forces agreed to include in its annual operating plans activities&#13;
ranging from monitoring of protected areas to the control of illegal trade of wildlife. The&#13;
National Police executes orders issued by the authorities and in particular by MARENA in the&#13;
natural resources and environmental areas. The National Police has signed a special&#13;
agreement with the Ministry of Health through which the police assumed the role of sanitary&#13;
inspectors. A similar agreement for the control of illegal logging is being discussed with&#13;
MARENA. Neither the Armed Forces nor the National Police have any special training on&#13;
natural resources and environmental aspects and this is considered a major constraint that&#13;
prevents these institutions from assuming the roles contained in the agreements they subscribed&#13;
to.&#13;
Other Environmental Institutions. A number of other institutions intervene in the&#13;
natural resources and environmental areas. The Ministry of Health has responsibilities over&#13;
water contamination. INAA (Instituto Nicaraguense de Acuaductos y Alcantarrillados)&#13;
regulates water use, proposes the establishment of water reserves in collaboration with&#13;
MARENA and cooperates with the Ministry of Health on water pollution. The National&#13;
Commission of Hydrological Resources (Comisi6n Nacional de Recursos Hidricos), which&#13;
depends from the President of the Republic, is in charge of water policy and solving water use&#13;
conflicts. The Ministry of Construction and Transport, together with MARENA, has&#13;
responsibilities over oil and other fossil fuels pollution. The National Ports Corporation&#13;
(Empresa Nacional de Puertos) and the General Directorate of Aquatic Transportation&#13;
(Direcci6n General de Transporte Acudtico), together with MARENA, oversee contamination&#13;
by ships. The Ministry of Agriculture and MARENA oversee issues of soil conservation. The&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture, MARENA, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Construction and&#13;
Transport, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Finance (Customs) and the municipalities all have&#13;
responsibilities over agro-chemical contamination, a very serious problem in Nicaragua, in&#13;
particular in the cotton rich area of Le6n and Chinandega. Until recently Nicaragua was the&#13;
largest producer of DDT in Central America and although DDT is now banned, problems of&#13;
contamination by this and other substances persist and are considered a serious health hazard&#13;
and one of the most critical environmental issues in the country. The Ministry of Economy is in&#13;
charge of issuing licenses and concessions for the fishery, mining and forestry, but MARENA&#13;
has a control and monitoring role over both the fishery resource and forests and contamination&#13;
from mining. The Nicaraguan Fisheries Corporation is in charge of fisheries policy.&#13;
3. NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES IN THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
Some 1.7 million of Nicaragua's 4.2 million people live in rural areas. Among&#13;
these rural inhabitants, 55% live in poverty and another 20% live in extreme poverty (IDA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Background: Natural Resources Issues and the Project Area&#13;
Page 10 of 12&#13;
Poverty Assessment, 1993). For rural people, the natural resources sector (including&#13;
agriculture) provides the main opportunities for income generation and employment. Currently&#13;
agriculture provides about 90% of employment for an estimated 420,000 persons.&#13;
Relative to other economic sectors, the agricultural sector has the lowest individual&#13;
income and wages. Agricultural employment is highly correlated with poverty. Despite&#13;
limited economic opportunities, the number of persons seeking a livelihood from natural&#13;
resources based sectors (including agriculture) has increased. With unemployment at 13%&#13;
nationally and underemployment estimated at 44%, the natural resources based sectors serve&#13;
as the "employer of last resort"; they are a social safety net where the exploitation of natural&#13;
capital subsidizes the survival of the poor and unemployed.&#13;
The combination of rural poverty and lack of altemative employment is expressed&#13;
on the environment through:&#13;
(1) increasing soil degradation from deforestation ' followed by the conversion of&#13;
forest lands to marginal livestock and agricultural uses and from the lack of&#13;
integration of conservation practices into land uses;&#13;
(2) increasing degradation of forest and biodiversity resources due to the&#13;
expansion of the agricultural frontier, non-application of control and&#13;
management systems in all types of exploitations (fuelwood, poles, timber,&#13;
hunting, harvesting of secondary products, etc), and inadequate protection of&#13;
parks and reserves;&#13;
(3) ongoing deterioration of water resources due to watershed degradation,&#13;
sediment loading, lack of treatment of effluent (urban, agroprocessing,&#13;
mining), and over-pumping of groundwater; and&#13;
(4) over-fishing and destruction of mangroves for domestic purposes and shrimp&#13;
pond construction.&#13;
Two regions where this situation is of particular concern are: (1) the former cotton&#13;
production areas of the Pacific (Departments of Le6n and Chinandega) where the decline of&#13;
cotton production has eliminated the region's major employer and forced many ex-agricultural&#13;
laborers and their children to turn to subsistence farming seeking land in areas of fragile&#13;
natural resources or to migrate to cities; and (2) along the agricultural frontier in the Atlantic&#13;
in the Departments of Rio San Juan, Chontales and Jinotega and in RAAS and RAAN. In the&#13;
latter, many ex-combatants and displaced persons have moved to the agricultural frontier in&#13;
search of lands and livelihood. A significant percentage of the poorest households are female&#13;
headed. Many of the rural householders are "new" farmers having had little or no previous life&#13;
experience as agriculturalists. Also in the Atlantic, climatic and soil conditions are sufficiently&#13;
different from those in Nicaragua's other agricultural regions that even experienced farmers&#13;
coming there are at a disadvantage.&#13;
2 _ In the Pacific zone much of the deforestation is historic, however there is yet ongoing degradation&#13;
of the remnant forest areas for domestic uses (timbers, poles, fuelwood). As the remaining Pacific&#13;
forests are generally those found in protected areas, upper watersheds, and coastal zones (mangroves),&#13;
the value of the environmental services which they perform as wildlife and breeding habitat and&#13;
watershed protection are still significant both locally and internationally (i.e. Golfo de Fonseca and&#13;
the forests of the Cordillera Volcanica Central).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

The project area thus comprises 32 municipalities in the Departments of&#13;
Chinandega and Le6n in the Pacific and Departments of Rio San Juan, RAAS and RAAN in&#13;
the Atlantic zone (see Table Al.9 for list of municipalities already selected for the program&#13;
and Maps in Annex 12). During the project's annual reviews the possibility of extending the&#13;
project to RAAN and parts of the Department of Jinotega and Chontales would be considered.&#13;
Within the 32 municipalities are located a total of 1,498 communities (1,283 in the Pacific&#13;
zone and 215 in the Atlantic zone). Total rural population (i.e., potential beneficiaries) of the&#13;
32 municipalities is about 477,000 persons (60,000 persons in the nine municipalities selected&#13;
in the Atlantic).&#13;

RURAL MUNICIPALITIES PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
SOCIAL ASSESSMENT:&#13;
POVERTY, GENDER AND INDIGENOUS ISSUES IN THE WESTERN REGION'&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
The Nicaraguan govemment used several consultative and participatory mechanisms&#13;
to prpare the project, including a series of workshops with non-governmental-organizations&#13;
(NGOs), community representatives, local governments and local leaders. From the outset&#13;
thiese takeholders provided important contributions to the design of the project. In addition,&#13;
prcuect prepamtion included a Social Assessment (SA) in the Departments of Le6n and&#13;
Chnandega, which are the project target areas during its first phase of implementation. The&#13;
SA was carried out between May and September 1995, with support from the FLAHS Fund.&#13;
And it included a special investigation of the indigenous group Sutiaba. The next step is to&#13;
eend the SA to the Atlantic region and include in it an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan,&#13;
to be conpleted before the GEF supported component and activities in RAAS and RAAN are&#13;
iniated.&#13;
The main objectives of the SA were to: (1) identify key stakeholders; (2) identify who&#13;
are the rural poor and what their living conditions are; (3) understand the views of the poor on&#13;
the causes of poverty and how to overcome them; (4) understand existing fanning systems and&#13;
te particular constraints under which farmers operate; (5) evaluate the main needs and&#13;
obstades to income generation among the poor; (6) evaluate the linkages between poverty and&#13;
anironment degradation; (7) assess the degree to which the rural poor are organized in NGOs&#13;
and/or in Community Based Organizations (CBOs); (8) assess the strength of local&#13;
organizations and the kind of services the rural poor obtain from them; (9) evaluate the&#13;
stakeholder's perceptions of local governments; (10) evaluate key gender issues and how the&#13;
project should address them; and (11) make recommendations on how to eluimnate/mitigate&#13;
risks, stabilize migration and strength the capacity of community organizations to better deliver&#13;
project services.&#13;
The SA included a study of the Sutiaba indigenous group, which is located in the&#13;
Department of Le6n. The Sutiabas are a mixture of an ethnically diverse population coming&#13;
from different areas of Le6n and rest of the country. Although the majority of residents have&#13;
Subtiaba ancestry, many others are not Subtiaba descendants but consider themselves Sutiaba.&#13;
This summary is based on background documents produced by Marcia Leite Ariera (consultant,&#13;
poverty), Mari Lisbeth GonzAlez (consultant, indigenous people), Marvin Ortega (consultant,&#13;
rapid rural appraisal) and Maria Correia (gender specialist, LA2NR). Social Assessment&#13;
Coordinator for the project is Valeria Pena (LATEN).&#13;

2. SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
Project Stakeholders&#13;
The primary stakeholders of the project are: (l) small farmers and other rural&#13;
poor-both men and women; (2) other farmers; (3) children and youth; (4) commnunity based&#13;
organizations; (5) the Subtiaba indigenous group; (6) NGQs; (7) municipal governments; and&#13;
(8) central government agencies. With the exception of some central government agencies it is&#13;
expected that all stakeholders will gain from the project. Some central government agencies, in&#13;
particular in the rural sector, could oppose the project since decentralization would somewhat&#13;
reduce their power.&#13;
General Economic and Demographic Features&#13;
The agricultural land in Leon and Chinandega used to be the most fertile of the&#13;
country-both areas were major producers of corn, beans and fruits. Since the 1950s,&#13;
however, production shifted towards export commodities like cotton, sugar cane and bananas.&#13;
The shift in production caused a loss of soil fertility over the long-In due to inappropriate&#13;
technzologies and over reliance on agrochemicals. The civil war, political conflict, returning&#13;
refugees, decreasing export crop prices, inflation and environrnental degradation have since&#13;
contributed to produce a decline in the living standards of the population. With a&#13;

Chinandega consists of 13 municipalities and has a population of about 373,000, which relies&#13;
primarily on agriculture. In both departments, about half the population live in rural areas. As&#13;
is common in poor regions, the population of the Western Region is young and younger than&#13;
Nicaragua's population as a whole-45.4 percent of the population consists of pre-school-age&#13;
and school age children under 14 years of age. About one fifth of the population is less than&#13;
six years old.&#13;
The adult population is predominantly female. About 25 percent of all households are&#13;
single headed and of those more than four fifths are headed by women. Differences in poverty&#13;
levels among single headed households are also apparent. In the rural Western Region, 75&#13;
percent of single headed households are poor, compared to 70 percent of conjugally headed&#13;
families. Moreover, as shown by the RRA, rural households headed by women are associated&#13;
with very small properties, smaller than three and a half hectares.2&#13;
Because labor is the most important asset of the poor, households become poorer as&#13;
the number of working age adults decreases in relation to the number of dependents. The&#13;
dependency ratio3 of the region, 0.84, is higher than the average ratio in rural areas (0.98).&#13;
Tne dependency ratio of the poor in the whole Western Region rises to 0.95. Households are&#13;

Number of children less than 12 years plus individuals over 60 years old divided by all other household&#13;
members.&#13;

more crowded in rural areas where poverty is greater: the average size of households is 5.4 in&#13;
the entire region, 3.2 in urban areas, and 5.7 in rural areas. The average size of households is&#13;
also higher among the poor and extreme poor: 6.8 in the whole Western Region and 6.7 in the&#13;
rural areas of the Western Region. Children make-up the majority of dependents.4 Children&#13;
make up a greater proportion of the population under the poverty line than among the non&#13;
poor.&#13;

Land Tenure&#13;
Four types of farmers were identified in the RRA. Small farmers with holdings&#13;
smaller than 3.5 hectares constitute the first group-58 percent of farmers are in this category.&#13;
Approximately one third of these households are female single-headed families. These small&#13;
properties, are more frequently found in the municipalities of El Jacaral, Santa Rosa, Achuapa,&#13;
Larreynaga y Quezalaguaque in the Department of Le6n, and in the municipalities of&#13;
Morazon, Cinco Pinos, San Francisco, Santo Tomas, San Pedro and Posoltega, in the&#13;
Department of Chinandega. Farmers tend to produce for self consumption and survival and&#13;
sell any surpluses they may have in local markets. Productivity levels, however, are&#13;
T he proportion of individuals over 60 years old is very low: 0.05 in the region and 0.01 in the rural area.&#13;
&#13;

constrained by the size of property, the absence of credit, and the low technology available.&#13;
These farmers have few or no trees close to the house and typically do not cultivate&#13;
vegetable gardens. Many farmers received land through the Sandinista agraran reform and&#13;
lack land titles, although the current Government is making efforts to provide secure titles.5&#13;
The second group-comprising some 29 percent of farmers-cultivate 3.5-15 hectares&#13;
of mostly corn, beans and sesame (ajonjoli). They also usually own a cow to produce milk for&#13;
household consumption. The female role is central in the survival strategies of this group,&#13;
since women sell domestic produce and are the primary household contact with the public.&#13;
A third group, about 8 percent, have larger properties and produce for the extemal&#13;
market, usually in association with livestock production. They are found in the municipalities&#13;
of El Viejo, Larreynaga, El Sauce, La Paz Central, Nagorote, Le6n, Chinandega, Somotilla,&#13;
and Villanueva. Although opportunities are limnited, smaller farmers are a source of labor for&#13;
these large farms.&#13;
Finally, a fourth group is composed of about 7 percent of farmers who are organized&#13;
in cooperatives created during the last decade. Usually, they combine work in the common&#13;
fields with work in their own land. Although women participate in cooperatives as family&#13;
laborers or as family members, they are often not formally recognized as cooperative members.&#13;
3. RURAL POVERTY&#13;
Living Conditions of the Poor&#13;
LSMS respondents in rural areas of the Westem region and SA participants were&#13;
distributed among 31 rural communities. The conditions of the 31 conmmunities are as follows:&#13;
*  2 have post offices&#13;
*  8 have paved roads leading to their communities&#13;
*  13 do not have access to motorized transportation&#13;
*  8 have a doctor and 6 a nurse, 13 do not have any doctor, nurse or midwife&#13;
* 4 have a pharmacy&#13;
* 5 do not have primary schools&#13;
* none of the commnunities have a daily market.&#13;
All respondents agreed that living conditions had not improved during the five years&#13;
previous to 1993. On the contrary, members of 26 communities believed that conditions had&#13;
worsened while the other five believed they have stayed the same. Absence of employment&#13;
opportunities, inflation, and high cost of living are the reasons given for this situation. In&#13;
Puerto Morazan it was reported during the RRA that "we are poorer now than before&#13;
because there are no sources of employment'" Very often, the pessimism is expressed in a&#13;

Land Management Project.&#13;

kind of religious fatalism, for example, "There are many people saying that this is the will of&#13;
God", as was said in Chinandega.&#13;
Access to water and sanitation in the project area is inadequate, particularly among the&#13;
rural poor. Less than half all households in the Westem Region have piped in-house water, of&#13;
which 72 percent of non-poor and 7 percent are extremely poor. Urban residents have greater&#13;
access to piped water but differences between poor and non-poor are greater in these urban&#13;
zones. Seventy percent of urban households have piped water, of which almost four fifths are&#13;
non-poor and 3 percent are poor. The inequality between groups is less dramatic in rural areas&#13;
because so few have access to water: 70 percent of the extreme poor, 63 percent of the poor,&#13;
and 68 percent of the non-poor do not have in-house piped water in rural zones.&#13;
Access to sanitation services is even scarcer. Only about 20 percent of all households&#13;
in the Western region are connected to public sewer systems, most of them non-poor&#13;
households. The extreme poor simply do not have access to sanitation services. Even septic&#13;
tanks benefit only 7 percent of households. In rural areas of the Western Region, 99 percent of&#13;
households have no access to public sewer systems, septic tanks, or cesspools. All households&#13;
with access to any of these types of sanitation services are non-poor.&#13;
The Poor's Perceptions of the Causes of Poverty&#13;
According to the local rural population, three major factors cause poverty: lack of&#13;
employment, diminishing productivity and limited markets. Participants cited stagnant&#13;
agricultural and livestock activities as the main reasons for limited employment and income.&#13;
For those who own the land, productivity has diminished and there is no credit available.&#13;
Among landowners interviewed during the RRA, 83 percent had not received credit or financial&#13;
assistance during the year prior to the interview. Lack of extemal and internal markets&#13;
emerged as another primary reasons for poverty. As explained by a small farner in El Viejo,&#13;
"The peasants do not have seeds, do not have minimal agricultural inputs, there is no&#13;
credit, there is no one to whom to sell, someone who buys instead of robbing us."&#13;
Data from the LSMS confirm the people's evaluation of their own poverty.&#13;
Altogether, 56 percent of respondents reported not working in the seven days prior to the date&#13;
of the interview, and 51 percent reported not having looked for a job, which can be interpreted&#13;
as an indicator of hopelessness. Once again, differences between urban and rural areas are&#13;
striking. Of those who had worked, 60 percent were urban-based and 40 percent were from&#13;
rural areas. During the year prior to the LSMS, 50 percent reported not having worked and of&#13;
those who had worked, 81 percent were urban residents. Among those rural inhabitants who&#13;
consider themselves employed, 41 percent are self-employed.&#13;
Irrational natural resources management is not cited in the RRA as a cause of poverty&#13;
and low agricultural productivity. Although there is a broad recognition that this is a&#13;
constraint, environment degradation was overwhelmingly identified as a consequence of&#13;
poverty as opposed to a cause.&#13;
Male temporary migration is now a common feature of the region. Migration is&#13;
directed towards Costa Rica more often than to other rural areas of Nicaragua. According to a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

priest in El Jicaral, "As they do not have anything to work with, no seeds, many go to&#13;
Costa Rica, lately 2500 have gone. Many also look for work In Ledn, Chinandega and&#13;
Matagalpa because in El Jacaral there are nojobs, the banana production does not&#13;
provide them employment anymore and the quality of the land is now very bad". Male&#13;
outmigration puts a strong pressure on women who are left to care for households in conditions&#13;
of extreme disadvantage. Migration, which began as a coping strategy for the poor, often&#13;
results in the break down of the family and neighborhood patterns of solidarity.&#13;

aural Organizations&#13;
In the Western Region people believe that solidarity is an important mechanism to&#13;
overcome poverty. According to a participant of the RRA: "only people who belong to some&#13;
organization are able to be conscious, the rest of the population, where there are no&#13;
organizations, is inditferent'. About 40 percent of RRA participants belong to at least one&#13;
organization. Of those who are organized, 42 percent belong to a producer organization, such&#13;
as a cooperative; 31 percent to a religious organization; 12 percent to a comununity&#13;
organization; 6 percent to a development project; 6 percent to a political party; and 3 percent&#13;
to a union. The organizational system which prevails is very intricate, having as key actors&#13;
foreign governments and donors, local and international NGOs, and local communities. This&#13;
system probably provides the most important safety net for the rural poor as indicated by the&#13;
following examples:&#13;
*   "There is a Commission for the environment protection in Villanueva and&#13;
Somotillo, counting with the participation of Casa de la Mujer, the Asociaci6n de&#13;
Ganaderos, the Polos de Desarrollo and the Police" (RRA).&#13;
*   The Fondo para Chinandega Norte, which is funded by Switzerland, was&#13;
constituted with support from the Secretaria de la Mujer de Chinandega and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;

Page 8 of 22&#13;
comprises more than 1000 women who, together with some NGOs, implement&#13;
several development projects.&#13;
In Chinandega, in the municipalities of Somotillo, Santo Tomas, Cinco Pinos,&#13;
San Pedro, San Francisco and Villanueva, the Commission de Desarrollo&#13;
Comarcal was formed and funds about ten projects with financial help from the&#13;
Swiss government.&#13;
According to the RRA, the most frequent organizational structures found in the area&#13;
are the following:&#13;
*  Comrtes comunales or comites comarcales operate at the level of municipality&#13;
and are usually initiated by the communities themselves. Members, who are&#13;
elected by the Community, usually consist of the midwife, the person in charge of&#13;
health services (brigadista de la salud), the teacher, a representative of the&#13;
municipality, and the priest. During the last decade, the Comites served as a&#13;
vehicle for demanding land. In Le6n, the Comites are the strongest and most&#13;
organized voice of local communities.&#13;
*  Cooperatives were organized during the last decade with the objective of pooling&#13;
resources, such as land and labor. Today about 61 cooperatives are active in the&#13;
area with 1,116 members, working 25,000 hectares of land.&#13;
*  Women groups, the most important of which are the Casas de Mujer, are spread&#13;
across some municipalities and linked to the National Organization of Women.&#13;
The focus of the Casas de Mujer is on professional training. They seldom work&#13;
on rural activities.&#13;
*  NGOs, are present in the entire region, particularly in Le6n, Chinandega,&#13;
Somotillo, El Sauce and El Viejo (refer to Annex I for details on NGOs).&#13;
*  Project Organizations such as: (1) Apoyo a la Actvidad Forestal Campesina de&#13;
Le6n, funded by Finland; (2) Proyecto de Conservaci6n y Manejo de Recursos&#13;
Naturales, funded by Holland and FAO; (3) Proyecto de Cultivos de Camarones&#13;
en Estanques, Puerto Morazon, funded by Christian Initiative of Munster&#13;
(Germany); and (4) Programa de Apoyo a la Conformaci6n de una Estrategia&#13;
de Desarrollo Alternativo para el Campesino Pobre, funded by Austria.&#13;
The Poor's Poverty Alleviation Priorities&#13;
Despite differences in access to formal education, men and women identify the same&#13;
priorities for alleviating their poverty. Support to agricultural subsistence activities was&#13;
overwhelmingly considered the highest priority amnong those interviewed by the RRA, followed&#13;
by access to health services and clean water (see Box 3.).&#13;
The Poor's Perceptions of Local Governments&#13;
Results of the RRA indicate that perceptions of local governments are mixed. While&#13;
most (75 percent) knew who was the mayor, 44 percent knew the council members, and 27&#13;
percent concurred that local governments consulted the population, many complained about&#13;
authorities. A common complaint was that although communities had been invited to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Assessment:&#13;
Poverty, Gender and Indigenous Issues in the Western Region&#13;
Page 9 of 22&#13;
municipal meetings and workshops, these events lacked continuity and only a few people&#13;
participated. Others noted that not aUl communities participate in workshops. Those who said&#13;
that the municipal administration does not consult the population, cited lack of community&#13;
organization, politics and the mayor's incapacity as reasons.&#13;
Participants also acknowledge the limitations of local governments to respond to local&#13;
problems. Some participants recognized that the local administration tries to answer their&#13;
needs as demonstrated by one response: "they gave landfor twenty years, for reforestation&#13;
on a lifelong basis, as a response to community requests, therefore they listen to peasants&#13;
and to the community" (male commnunity member, Chinandega). Others thought that the&#13;
mayor did not make an effort to meet community demands: "he listens to them either through&#13;
their representatives or he sees them in his office, but he does not solve the problems"&#13;
(female conmmunity member, Le6n). Activities carried out at by the municipal administration&#13;
creates a certain awareness of local government. Fifteen percent of respondents said that the&#13;
mayor had helped them with land problems whereas about 20 percent had received help for&#13;
seeds. Thirty nine percent recognized municipal support for education, 37 percent for health&#13;
and 36 percent for road maintenance.&#13;

In terms of the best form of organization for articulating conmnunity demands, 43 percent&#13;
preferred a Comite Comarcal, 17 percent wanted a small committee, 11 percent preferred&#13;
small groups of interested people, 11 percent preferred individual interaction with municipal&#13;

4. GENDER ISSUES&#13;
Gender Roles and Priorities&#13;
While men's roles in the economy are well acknowledged, women play an important&#13;
role in the survival strategies of the poor not only through their partnership with men in&#13;
conjugal-headed households, but because they frequently live on their own, heading households&#13;
without a male partner. Studies in Nicaragua indicate that while rural men control productive&#13;
resources and land, women in poor households-both jointly and single headed-contribute&#13;
significantly to household income. Single headed female households depend exclusively on&#13;
women's income. Similarly, women in conjugal households are often responsible for providing&#13;
fbr the family during the agricultural off-season and periods of scarcity. Particularly when&#13;
fann and off-fhrm opportunities for men are restricted, women will resort to selling garden&#13;
products and small livestock, petty trading and domestic labor in order to sustain the family.&#13;
Women's crops are also a major source of family nutrients year round and therefore represent&#13;
a key element of the rural poor's survival strategies.&#13;
The survey showed that in terms of addressing poverty, support to agricultural&#13;
production is the highest priority of men and women, however, their agricultural technology,&#13;
extension and training needs will vary. A division of labor in agricultural and livestock&#13;
production exists in Nicaragua. Broadly speaking, basic grains and livestock are primarily the&#13;
domain of men while women are the dominant producers of horticulture products, fruits and&#13;
small livestock and play a secondary role in producing basic grains. Women also predominate&#13;
in marketing farm products.&#13;
Men and women use natural resources for different purposes and this, in tum, affects&#13;
their priorities and participation levels in environmental projects. The principal causes of&#13;
deforestation in the project area are felling for commnercial purposes, the expansion of&#13;
agricultural lands and hunting-which are typically male activities and hence male interests.&#13;
Women, in contrast, tend to be more concerned about domestic fuelwood. Water emerged as a&#13;
prirnary interest of both men and women but while domestic consumption was a female&#13;
concem, men showed greater interest in water for irrigation and production. Gender-based&#13;
interests in natural resources are reflected in participation rates in environmental projects&#13;
which tend to have intrinsic social goals and be domninated by women. Women's decision-&#13;
making roles on these projects, however, is usually less prominent than men's.&#13;
Gender Differences in Education&#13;
Female single-headed households are at disadvantage when it comes to education.&#13;
Education plays a central role in an individual's ability to move out of poverty and, therefore,&#13;
the fact that female heads of households are much less educated than males places female&#13;
single-headed households in a more vulnerable position. The gender inequality pattem is&#13;
pervasive in the Western region in which, for each educational level complete, male heads&#13;
outnumber women heads on a 2 to I basis up to the primary level and on a 4 to 1 basis from&#13;
the secondary level as graph 4 in the next page shows. The pattem of inequality is greater in&#13;
rural than in urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Assessment:&#13;
Poverty, Gender and Indigenous Issues in the Westem Region&#13;
Page 11 of 22&#13;
Gender and Participation in Rural Organizations&#13;
The SA indicates that men and women are involved in different forms of organization&#13;
with women participating to the greatest extent in service-oriented groups (religious and&#13;
community) and men predominating in producer organizations (UNAG, cooperatives and&#13;
unions). For example, men comprise 88 percent of members of agriculture and livestock&#13;
cooperatives in the region. Men also predominate in municipal governmen. in the region,&#13;
comprising 83 percent of mayors and 89 percent of the consejales. While a gender&#13;
breakdown of local government committees (comarcales) is not available, it is expected that&#13;
women's and men's involvement is more balanced given that these committees typically consist&#13;
of the local midwife, teacher and health worker as well as representatives of producer groups&#13;
and the church.&#13;

A corollary of gender differences in organizations is that, relative to men, women will&#13;
have less access to information and resources because producer groups tend to be better&#13;
organized and have greater political clout. The SA supports this assertion. It showed that&#13;
overall men's participation in organizations was greater than women's and that membership in&#13;
organizations was associated with land tenure security and other resources. Women surveyed&#13;
also had less knowledge of their municipal leaders than men.&#13;

5. THE SUTIABAS&#13;
Who Are the Sutiabas?&#13;
The Sutiabas are one of thirteen Nicaraguan indigenous groups that claim a "native&#13;
background". In the words of a Sutiabas leader, "nativ background is the right that all of&#13;
us, native people, have, to respect our own culture and historical lraditions,fornm  of social&#13;
organization and the ownership of our communal land". The basis for the Sutiabas ethnic&#13;
identity is rooted in their kinship relationships, which provide social and ethnic cohesion. The&#13;
Sutiabas kinship system, however, has been eroded as a result of the changes that the country&#13;
has experienced through its history. Kinship is no longer restricted to the children of Sutiaba&#13;
fathers and mothers, but rather to the identification of individuals with Sutiabas values and&#13;
costumes. The migration of ladinos to the Sutiaba region, attracted by the possibility of&#13;
fanning communal lands since colonial times, allowed for a reinterpretation of kinship&#13;
networks to include the children of the ethnic nix which resulted from migration. Migration&#13;
also brought about acculturation, loss of control over communal land property, and periods of&#13;
violence resulting discrimination and from the predominance of ladinos.&#13;
Sutiaba History&#13;
Since Spanish colonization, the history of the Sutiabas is characterized by a permanent&#13;
tension on land rights and efforts on the part of Le6n landowners to take increasingly larger&#13;
tracts of traditional indigenous territories. Strategies to squeeze the Sutiaba's traditional land&#13;
rights included invading their lands, dissolving Sutiaba autonomous forms of economic and&#13;
social organization through national government legislation and promoting "ladinizacion" of&#13;
indigenous communities. Since the mid-18th Century, the Sutiabas have constituted an&#13;
independent political-administrative division of the city of Le6n. In 1850, with the introduction&#13;
of coffee plantations, the need for labor led the government to issue legislation on vagrancy and&#13;
mandatory labor which justified the forceful and massive recruitment of Indians for farm labor.&#13;
The introduction of cotton crops in the 1950s exacerbated tensions and violence.&#13;
Some battles have marked the Sutiabas political conscience and have became political&#13;
references which, in tum, have strengthened their ethnic identity. Intemal contradictions on the&#13;
most effective means of conducting such disputes, on the other hand, have weakened the&#13;
community to some extent.&#13;

The Sutiaba population of about 36,000 constitutes 17 percent of the total population&#13;
in the Department of Le6n.6 The majority -approximately 23,000-live in urban areas and&#13;
the remaining 12,000 living in rural areas. Rural Sutiabas are spread over nine rural&#13;
comarcas which are also populated by non-Sutiaba residents. Rural residents currently&#13;
occupy an area of approximately 580 square kilometers, which represents a small fraction of&#13;
previous Sutiabas' territory.&#13;

Urban Sutiaba live in the traditional historical site of the Sutiaba pueblo, on the&#13;
westem side of the city of Leo6n and in twenty-four small urban settlements to the North, South&#13;
and West of the Sutiaba pueblo. The Governuent created these settlements in the mid-80s as&#13;
part of its overall strategy to counter military aggression originating in neighboring Honduras.&#13;
The municipal administration of Le6n, has been using the areas around the Sutiaba community&#13;
to establish settlements and absorb the city's natural urban growth. Such settlements&#13;
-although created without consulting the Sutiabas-are not a source of conflict because the&#13;
Sutiaba community has accepted the new settlers. Overall, it is estimated that around 15&#13;
percent of the urban population (approximately 3,500 residents) live in the settlements, with&#13;
the remainder living in the historical Sutiaba site.&#13;
Although the majority of residents have local Sutiaba ancestry, it common for all&#13;
dwellers in Sutiaba territory to identify themselves as indigenous Sutiabas, to share the&#13;
Sutiabas cultural traditions, and to make claims to communal land. Ninety-eight of RRA&#13;
participants identified themselves as indigenous Sutiaba, although only 71 percent have either&#13;
the father or the mother born in Sutiaba. The same percentage of women and men identified&#13;
themselves as indigenous Sutiabas, although there are more women (80 percent) than men (64&#13;
percent) with at least one Sutiaba parent.&#13;
The Sutiabas Land Claims&#13;
Presently, Sutiaba lands extend from the Northwest to the Southeast of the City of&#13;
Le6n, in the plains between the Maribios Mountains and the Pacific coast. The land is mostly&#13;
flat except south of the city of Le6n where slopes are steeper and elevations reach almost 150&#13;
meters above sea level. Two rivers, the Telica and the Chiquito cut the region. The Chiquito&#13;
River has been contaminated by domestic and industrial waste. Both rivers contain about 40&#13;
percent of all river water in the department. Statistical data on Sutiaba land and land&#13;
ownership is conflicting and disorganized. Different versions of what constitutes Sutiaba&#13;
property makes it difficult to deternine precisely which portion of the land belongs to the&#13;
conmmunity, which portion belongs to peasants and which portions were under the control of&#13;
other groups. The royal title in the hands of the indigenous community states that the land&#13;
belonging to the Sutiabas is equal to 63 "caoallerias" and 12 "atillos", ancient Spanish&#13;
measures about which there is no information on the corresponding area.&#13;
A key to understanding the Sutiabas land situation is the way land titles have been&#13;
distributed and are recognized. Within the 7,000 hectares which are under the direct control of&#13;
the conmmunity, many small farmners were given supplementary titles to land.. Only 11 percent&#13;
of small farmers recognze that the land they work is part of traditional communal lands.&#13;
Fewer than 15 percent of members of local cooperatives are Sutiabas, but these cooperatives&#13;
own between 27 and 30 percent of traditional Sutiaba lands (8,000 hectares).&#13;
Among rural and urban participants of the RRA, about 44 percent do not own any&#13;
property, 45 percent own some property, and the rest work on communal properties. Fifty&#13;
percent of land owners own less than 10 manzanas and the vast majority-89 percent-have&#13;
registered legal title to the property. Only 3 percent of Sutiabas farmers were cooperative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Assessment:&#13;
Poverty, Gender and Indigenous Issues in the Westem Region&#13;
Page 14 of 22&#13;
menbers. Eighty percent of urban Sutiabas do not own land and 6 percent are small&#13;
landowners with properties less than 3 manzanas.&#13;
The majority of Sutiabas live in poverty, have few resources for market production&#13;
and are exposed to climatic hazards. Farmers with properties of about 15 hectares who live&#13;
above the poverty line constitute only 8 percent of farmers. In rural areas, only 6 percent of&#13;
residents do not own any land but about 50 percent own properties smaller than 3.5 hectares&#13;
and live in extreme poverty. An important segment in rural areas are the 40 percent of&#13;
peasants with properties between 7-15 hectares. They are poor peasants who sell an important&#13;
part of their crops in the market and who, like their urban counterparts, are very vulnerable to&#13;
climatic changes.&#13;
Employment and Income Among the Sutiaba&#13;
Employment dynamics among the Sutiabas does not differ from the general trends of&#13;
the other poor in the Westem region. Unemployment is high and employment, when available,&#13;
is restricted to low paid and unqualified jobs. In the urban area, about 44 percent of&#13;
participants considered themselves as unemployed and about 20 percent did not have a&#13;
permanent job. In total about 65 percent of respondents in urban Sutiaba were unemployed or&#13;
held unstable jobs.&#13;
Women Sutiabas are restricted to professions such as commnerce, maid services,&#13;
teaching and nursing. The majority of Sutiabas women who do not work define themselves as&#13;
housewives rather than unemployed. According to one participant: "I haven 't had a job since&#13;
1990; Idon 't even lookfor ajob anymore because I can 'tfind any" (Sutiaba housewife). In&#13;
urban areas, the economically active population for women is the same as that of men.&#13;
Women also have lower incomes relative to men (a little over 50 percent of the price of a basic&#13;
food basket for women as opposed to 70 percent for men). The middle-level&#13;
technic4l/professional category for women in commerce is the only employment category that&#13;
has above average income levels, although these incomes are only close to the price of the&#13;
basic food basket. A significant proportion of women work as maids, which is one of the&#13;
lowest paid jobs in the economy. In rural areas, the situation for women is even more difficult&#13;
because they are not even recognized a farmers although most perform agricultural tasks&#13;
alongside men.&#13;
The majority of the rural-based economically active population works as small farmers&#13;
or rural workers. The latter are mostly seasonally employed for about 5 to 6 months a year.&#13;
All rural families grow basic crops such as beans and com usually on lands smaller than one&#13;
manzana. Quantities of food produced are not enough to sustain the family, a situation that&#13;
forces members of the family to seek alternate survival strategies such as selling firewood and&#13;
working as day laborers or in construction jobs in exchange for food.&#13;
The Sutiabas are organized in 18 cooperatives which sow about 2,600 hectares of&#13;
corn, beans and sorgo annually. The cooperatives, however, do not generate permanent work&#13;
year round for their members. Crops are grown using non-traditional technological levels and&#13;
generally occupy members 6 months every year, leaving them unemployed for the remaining 6&#13;
months.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Assessment:&#13;

Page 15 of 22&#13;
The Sutiabas and the Environment&#13;
The Sutiabas have no experience managing forest areas nor has this concem been part&#13;
of their tradition in light of the more pressing need for survival. Sutiaba territory lacks&#13;
important forest areas except fbr a few patches of tropical dry woods. Forest destruction is&#13;
caused mostly by cutting for domestic and commercial firewood. Almost 82 percent of RRA&#13;
participants use firewood for cooking.&#13;
Social Organization Among the Sutiabas&#13;
Social capital among the Sutiabas is high-about 48 percent of RRA participants are&#13;
members of community organizations. Although gender differences are small, more men are&#13;
organized than women. The largest organization is the ndigenous Community; 55 percent of&#13;
RRA participants reported belonging to the Indigenous Community, of which a slightly higher&#13;
proportion were urban-based. The second most important form of organization are those&#13;
related to development projects-17 percent of participants claimed that they were members of&#13;
these types of groups.&#13;
The traditional Sutiaba organizations are the Junta Directiva de la Comunidad&#13;
Indigena, the Consejo de Ancianos, the Consejos Comunales, and the Juntas de&#13;
Cementerio. Characteristics of these organizations are as follows:&#13;
&#149;   The Junta Directiva is elected by popular vote for a two-year mandate, although&#13;
government regulations state that elections should be annual. As a result of the&#13;
economic, social and political changes that affected the ethnic composition of the&#13;
Sutiaba communities, the Sutiabas require only kinship as a basis for membership&#13;
in the community. Thus, voting rights are given to any individual who has been&#13;
residing in the comnmunity for more than seven years whenever they accept and&#13;
identify with the Sutiabas' indigenous values, even in the absence of Sutiaba&#13;
ancestry. From a political and administrative point of view, this is the&#13;
indigenous organization with the largest mandate, although it does not constitute a&#13;
pure form of autonomous local governrment. Both urban and rural Sutiabas are&#13;
under the jurisdiction of the municipality of Leon.&#13;
*   The Junta Directiva is not a traditional Sutiaba organization although it was&#13;
created by the Sutiabas to deal with issues related to the indigenous community.&#13;
Its origins relate to the Sutiabas process of incorporation in Le6n. Most likely the&#13;
organizational structure started as a mechanism promoted by government and&#13;
local landowners to counter indigenous land disputes which had been led by&#13;
traditional indigenous organizations like the Consejo de Ancianos. Basic&#13;
activities of the Junta Directiva are: mediating community relationships with the&#13;
city administration and the central government; administering community land;&#13;
coordinating activities with different indigenous organizations; and representing&#13;
the Sutiabas in the Coordination of Nicaraguan Indigenous Communities. It has&#13;
also promoted activities in the area of social, economic and cultural development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Assessment:&#13;
Poverty, Gender and Indigenous Issues in the Western Region&#13;
Page 16 of 22&#13;
But the Junta Directiva 's main asset in the moral authority won during land&#13;
disputes. The Junta is recognized by the Sutiabas as their moral and political&#13;
authority even though this role has been weakened in recent years by political&#13;
polanzation.&#13;
*   The Consejo deAncianos was the highest authority in the community before the&#13;
Spanish colonization and has remained so despite attempts by past governments&#13;
and colonial powers to weaken this organizational structure. The council&#13;
virtually disappeared in the first half of the twentieth century, but reappeared in&#13;
the 80s due to interest among the people and particularly the efforts of the Junta&#13;
Directiva. The Consejo de Ancianos is an autonomous moral authority with&#13;
approximately 35 members who are elders in the community. Members must be&#13;
born in Sutiaba, belong to old famnilies of conununal tradition, be recognized as&#13;
an advocate of communal land property, have been a member of the Junta&#13;
Directiva, and have an untarnished reputation.&#13;
*   The Consejos Comunales are neighborhood organizations with representatives&#13;
elected at the vicinity-level. Their rnain responsibility is to respond to social&#13;
demands of residents.&#13;
*   The Juntas de Cementerio are in charge of maintaining and managing five&#13;
community cemeteries as well as observing religious traditions and Holy Week&#13;
rituals.&#13;
Traditional productive organizations no longer exist among the Sutiaba. The&#13;
cooperatlvas, which are presently the most usual model of productive organization in the&#13;
community, emerged in 1979. Each of the 18 Sutiaba cooperatives has an average of 17&#13;
members, who are mostly urban based. Eleven of the cooperatives are part of the UCAIS&#13;
(Uni6n de las Cooperativas Indigenas de Sutiaba), which provide associate members with&#13;
technical assistance, storage, marketing and legal and bookkeeping advice. UCAIS has the best&#13;
capacity for economic management in the community.&#13;
In addition to the advice it provides to associate members, UCAIS operates a number&#13;
of other programs including a program for female farmers; the Asociaci6n de Ganaderos de&#13;
Sutiaba (ASOGASA), which is a small association of members who own lands outside the&#13;
Sutiaba territory limits; and the Fondo Revolvente de Credito Xuchiall, which is revolving&#13;
loan fund for productive activities. This fund was created by the Junta Directiva de la&#13;
Comunidad and the Nicaraguan Institute for Investigations and Popular Education (INIEP).&#13;
Until 1995, it had provided financing to 122 families, 79 percent of which were female single-&#13;
headed. A team of indigenous Sutiaba professionals manage the fund.&#13;
The two most important organizations that work with women and youth among the&#13;
Sutiabas are:&#13;
The Fundacion para el Desarrollo Integral de la Mujer Indigena "Xochitl&#13;
Acatl " which receives support from European funds and UNICEF to work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Asssmnt:&#13;

with women. Funds support informal credit for poultry production, vegetable&#13;
gardens, cattle and reforestation. To this date, 47 female single-heads of&#13;
household have benefited from resources for productive activities. Funds also&#13;
offer educational programs in health, family planning, pre-natal and infant&#13;
care, and sanitation. In cooperation with the Universidad Nacional&#13;
Aut6noma and cooperating physicians, the Foundation supports clinical&#13;
activities which have benefited an average of 290 patients a month in&#13;
traditional medicine and 240 in non-traditional medicine. Other programs for&#13;
women and youth at risk include education in sexuality, fertility, sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases, solidarity and equality.&#13;
The Movimiento de J6venes Indigenas "Hringue Nidi Ruis" (Children of the&#13;
Sun) offers program in health, water, electricity, education, enviromnent,&#13;
culture and sports. Major sources of funding include UNDP and UNFPA for&#13;
the project on Recreation and Attention Centers for Sutiaba Adolescents&#13;
(CARAS).&#13;
Tlhe presence of non govermnental organizations in the Sutiaba territory is weak&#13;
except for the ones mentioned above. CARE, CIPRES and CEPAD also support small&#13;
susainable projects in water, agriculture and irrigation in a few districts.&#13;
6. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
The main conclusions of the Social Assessment are as follows:&#13;
(a)    Rural areas of the Western region show the poorest social indicators. In&#13;
contrast with urban areas, poverty in rural zones is greater, opportunities are&#13;
fewer, educational levels are worse, and there is less access to infrastructure&#13;
services. Health and education facilities, sanitation, roads, and access to&#13;
local markets are unsatisfactory in many areas.&#13;
(b)    Rural households are more crowded and have a higher dependency ratio than&#13;
in urban ones. The proportion of children in poverty is high in the entire&#13;
region, and higher in rural than in urban areas. Children are an at-risk&#13;
population group.&#13;
(c)    In the project area, the main gender issues are: (i) single-headed households,&#13;
which tend to be female, tend to be poorer than conjugally-headed households;&#13;
(iii) both men and women play a role in the survival strategies of the poor but&#13;
women have a particularly critical position because they are responsible for&#13;
most single-headed households and often provide for conjugally-headed&#13;
families during periods of scarcity; (iv) the gender division of labor on the&#13;
farm and in the household imply that technology, extension and training needs&#13;
among men and women vary; (v) men and women use natural resources&#13;
differently and therefore also have different priorities in environmental&#13;
activities; (vi) educational levels among women tends to be lower than among&#13;
men which, in tum, affects women's ability to participate in project activities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Assessment:&#13;
Poverty, Gender and Indigenous Issues in the Western Region&#13;
Page 18 of 22&#13;
and (vii) men and women have different forms of organization which affects&#13;
their access to information and resources.&#13;
(d)    The rural poor, including the Sutiaba rural poor, are predominantly small&#13;
farmers, often landless. Frequently, households live off properties of less than&#13;
3.5. Productivity is low and access to markets is difficult.&#13;
(e)    Two interrelated factors cause poverty: first, the small size of property&#13;
coupled with extremely low productivity from inappropriate technologies and&#13;
lack of financing; and second, the absence of off-farm employment&#13;
opportunities for the poor.&#13;
(f)    According to the poor, poverty results from lack of employment, low&#13;
agricultural productivity and limited access markets. Based on their diagnosis&#13;
of poverty, the priorities of the poor are: first, projects oriented to support&#13;
agricultural production; and second, health services. Water supply is a&#13;
priority for both agricultural needs and family consumption. The environment&#13;
is not seen a priority because is it not perceived as a constraint to poverty.&#13;
(g)    The sense of hopelessness that prevails arnong the poor is often compensated&#13;
by a cultural disposition for social solidarity. The poor in the project area are&#13;
well organized. They participate in community groups such as the cornites&#13;
comarcales, cooperatives, women's associations, Sutiaba cooperatives,&#13;
NGOs, and project groups. Foreign donors, however, largely mobilized and&#13;
sustain these community organizations.&#13;
(h)    The main problems of the Sutiabas are land disputes. However a vast portion&#13;
of the Sutiaba land is under conmmunity control and this control cannot be&#13;
legally challenged. This includes cooperative land legalized by the&#13;
governnent. Indigenous leaders requested that the project prioritize women&#13;
because their experience shows these investments produce greater benefits to&#13;
the family. Rural projects are of little interest to urban-based Sutiaba because&#13;
they are for the most part city dwellers.&#13;
7. ACTION PLAN FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project implementation would take into account the recommnendations of the Social&#13;
Assessment and Indigenous and Gender studies in the following ways.&#13;
Rural Poverty&#13;
(a)    Municipal Technical Units and INIFOM would actively promote the project in&#13;
eligible communities to make information available to the rural poor by using&#13;
local meetings, churches and radio in this dissemination process. Considering&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Assessment:&#13;
Poverty, Gender and Indigenous Issues in the Western Region&#13;
Page 19 of 22&#13;
the low formal education level, particularly among women, the project would&#13;
emphasize visual materials such as videos.&#13;
(b)    The project would promote and support two key community structures to help&#13;
the poor voice their demands and force local governments to respond to&#13;
them-Interconrmunity Assembly and Community Supervision&#13;
Committee-which include members elected by communities.&#13;
(c)    The project would support several training programs for communities directly&#13;
and for professionals (private, NGOs, government) that would provide&#13;
services to these communities.&#13;
(d)    The subproject categories include most priority investments identified by the&#13;
poor during the Rapid Rural Appraisals.&#13;
(e)    Periodic rural appraisals would assess the results of project implementation&#13;
and, in particular, if it is effectively reaching the poor. A annual review would&#13;
permit changes in the project to accommodate results from rapid rural&#13;
appraisals.&#13;
Gender&#13;
(f)    Gender Goals. The project would promote male and female participation and&#13;
benefits to men and women by including gender as an explicit goal of&#13;
municipal development. Gender goals would also be reflected in the&#13;
philosophy of the municipal development component of the project and&#13;
included in staff training so that gender becomes a part of staff values.&#13;
Training on gender issues would also include members of the municipal and&#13;
participatory structures involved in the project (municipal governments,&#13;
municipal technical unit, intercommunity assembly and community&#13;
supervision committee)&#13;
(g)    All personnel working on the project would be given the explicit responsibility&#13;
of involving men and women in municipal development activities, and this&#13;
duty would be reflected in staff terms of reference (including INIFOM&#13;
personnel, other project staff and municipal technicians). The project would&#13;
avoid establishing special segregated programs for women which tend to&#13;
marginalize women and imply that women's programs are an appendage to&#13;
mainstream project activities.&#13;
(h)    To ensure that gender is adequately internalized in project implementation the&#13;
project would recruit a participation and gender advisor to work on staff of&#13;
INIFOM as part of the project team. The advisor would act as a catalyst and&#13;
resource person and ensure that gender is adequately covered in promotion and&#13;
information dissemination activities, participatory microplanning and&#13;
monitoring. The advisor would also monitor the effectiveness of the project in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Assessment:&#13;
Poverty, Gender and Indigenous Issues in the Western Region&#13;
Page 20of22&#13;
reaching men and women. Tenms of reference for the participation and gender&#13;
advisor are in the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
(i)    Training Programs. To enhance men's and women's participation, the&#13;
project would train staff on how to detect gender differences and constraints to&#13;
participation, and how to develop strategies for overconiing gender barriers in&#13;
the project.&#13;
(j)    Project Promotion. The project would ensure that promotional material and&#13;
communications channels reflect gender differences and constraints.&#13;
Specifically, materials would avoid gender stereotypes in visual displays and&#13;
text and portray men and women as equal participants in the project. The&#13;
project would design a promotional and communications strategy for men and&#13;
women based on the following information in project areas: (a) specific local&#13;
gathering spots for men and women; (b) frequently used or accessible forms of&#13;
mass media for men and women; (c) time that men and women use media&#13;
channels; and (d) traditional means of communication. It is expected that the&#13;
project will establish a door to door promotional campaign to ensure both men&#13;
and women are invited to introductory meetings and microplanning sessions.&#13;
If societal norms inhibit women's participation with men, the project will&#13;
gather men and women separately and train community men and women on&#13;
gender issues to avoid possible conflicts.&#13;
(k)    Participatory Planning and Subproject Implementation. The project would&#13;
use a participatory planning methodology with a gender perspective to ensure&#13;
that both men and women have access to municipal funds and are involved in&#13;
determining community priorities and planning and executing subprojects.&#13;
The methodology will consider: gender-based social divisions in the&#13;
cosnmunity; time schedules of men and women; gender differences in&#13;
geographical mobility; literacy, education and training differences in men and&#13;
women; and organizational capacity and legal status of men's and women's&#13;
groups.&#13;
(I)    The project will encourage female participation through their own&#13;
organizations in situations where men dominate and have greater influence in&#13;
conmmunity organizations, but will work towards mainstreaming women in&#13;
community groups by training women in organization, leadership and self-&#13;
esteem and training men on gender issues. The project will also schedule&#13;
activities to coincide with time and geographical limitations faced by men and&#13;
women (e.g. on Sundays following or before religious services).&#13;
(m)   Training and Capacity Building at the Community Level. The project will&#13;
support training programs to compensate for illiteracy among community&#13;
members which in tum impedes participation in the project (particularly on the&#13;
part of women). Training and information disseniination will involve means&#13;
other than written materials (such as oral communications tools) to avoid&#13;
illiteracy obstacles. The project will recruit trainers and intermediary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Social Assessment:&#13;
Poverty, Gender and Indigenous Issues in the Western Region&#13;
Page 21 of 22&#13;
organizations based on their capacity and experience to work with illiterate&#13;
people. Training naterials supported by the project will include manuals,&#13;
workbooks and learning tools, such as games, that use simple concepts,&#13;
illustrations, colors and cartoon figures.&#13;
(n)    Project Monitoring and Evaluation. The project establishes gender&#13;
desegregated indicators into the monitoring and evaluation process of the&#13;
project to measure the differential impact of the project on men and women&#13;
and the effect of men's and women's participation on project outputs.&#13;
Indicators that will be differentiated by gender include: (a) members of&#13;
participatory structures; (b) attendance at community assemblies; (c)&#13;
participation in community and municipal planning; (d) number of people&#13;
participating in environmental, natural resources and productive subprojects;&#13;
and (e) number of direct and indirect beneficiaries of subprojects.&#13;
(o)    Special Studies and Review Procedures. The project would finance special&#13;
studies to measure the effect of the project activities on poverty reduction, by&#13;
gender of the individual involved in the activity. Specifically, the annual&#13;
reviews would examine: (i) gender opportunities and constraints to&#13;
participation at the family, group and conmnunity level and project strategies&#13;
to overcome these constraints and/or create opportunities (i.e. impact of&#13;
information campaigns and communications channels used, timing of&#13;
introductory and participatory sessions, special training for men on gender&#13;
issues, leadership training for women, etc.); (ii) impact of INIFOM staff,&#13;
municipal technicians and consultants (used to provide technical assistance) to&#13;
promote male and female participation in project activities (impact of training&#13;
for staff, staff incentives); and (iii) the strengths and weaknesses of&#13;
approaches to integrate men and women in project activities.&#13;
Sutiabas&#13;
(p)    Resolution of the century long problem of Sutiaba land tenure will involve a&#13;
slow process of negotiations and conflict resolution between the Sutiaba and&#13;
non-Sutiaba and will not be directly addressed by the project. Land titling&#13;
issues would generally be addressed by INRA which is being supported&#13;
through the Agricultural Technology and Land Management Project (Credit&#13;
No. 2536-NI). The proposed project would help the Sutiaba through two&#13;
mechanisms: (i) Sub-project proposals for the preparation of land demarcation&#13;
proposals would be eligible for financing and (ii) Indigenous organizations&#13;
would be strengtlhened through the training programs and specific capacity&#13;
building subprojects that they may propose.&#13;
(q)    Regarding participation and municipal investments, the Sutiabas and other&#13;
indigenous comrnmunities would be treated differently from non-indigenous&#13;
communities. While for non-indigenous people a community is defined as a&#13;
"comarca" which is a geographical unit, for indigenous people in the Pacific&#13;
and Atlantic, the community would be the indigenous group independently of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

their regional coverage. Indigenous traditional decision-making structure&#13;
would be the mechanisms for defining priorities and supervising subprojwct&#13;
inmplenentation.&#13;

NICARAGUA&#13;
RURAL MUNICIPALITIES PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION1&#13;
1. Component I: Rural MuniciDalities Develonment&#13;
Background and Rationale&#13;
The rural municipalities development component was designed to respond to: (1)&#13;
the need to strengthen local institutions in rural areas: local governments, NGOs and&#13;
communities; (2) the need to foster economic growth in rural areas where most of the poor are&#13;
located; (3) the need to directly provide support to the poorest men and women; and (4) the&#13;
need to conserve and restore critical natural resources and protect the local environment.&#13;
There were several key considerations underlying the design of this component: (1)&#13;
in Nicaragua local institutions are closer to problems of, internalize better and can be more&#13;
easily made accountable to the needs of the rural poor; (2) with the proper incentives local&#13;
institutions can be more efficient in practicing sustainable management of natural resources;&#13;
(3) lagging rural investment is partially due to a local financing system that benefits large&#13;
urban centers and that has prevented local rural institutions from developing their decision-&#13;
making capacity; (4) given the current assistance programs to reform central government&#13;
agencies focusing them on normative aspects there is a need to decentralize the delivery of&#13;
local public services and goods; (5) key institutions such as the FISE and NRDP that&#13;
presently deliver local investments have a limited time horizon and can only be sustained with a&#13;
permanent flow of aid resources; there is a need for long term sustainable alternatives to them;&#13;
(6) there is cumulative evidence from Brazil, Bolivia, Mexico and Colombia that if properly&#13;
designed, systems for delivering rural development services and addressing rural poverty&#13;
through local governments can be quite successful; (7) Nicaragua's strategy as reflected in the&#13;
Partial Reform to the Constitution of 1995, in the work of the Decentralization Commission of&#13;
Government and in various laws and regulations is to increasingly shift more resources and&#13;
decision power to local governments; and (8) local governments already have large&#13;
responsibilities over sustainable development in their jurisdictions.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The objective of this component is to establish a mechanism based on municipal&#13;
governments and community organizations for reducing rural poverty through rural investment&#13;
in economic infrastructure, improved natural resource management and small-scale communal&#13;
productive activities.&#13;
I     This Annex describes some project features that are described in more detail in the following&#13;
documents in the project file: Plan de Implementaci6n del Proyecto, Reglamento Operativo, Manual&#13;
de Capacitaci6n and Plan Operacional para 1996/1997.&#13;

Component Description&#13;
This component would include the following subcomponents: (A) institutional&#13;
development of municipalities; (B) information, participation and training; (C) community and&#13;
municipality sub-projects; and (D) institutional development of INIFOM.&#13;
(A) Institutional Development of Municipalities (US$5.8 million)&#13;
The objective of this subcomponent is to create the minimum technical and&#13;
managerial capacity at the municipal level to assist the rural poor, manage natural resources&#13;
and protect the environment, to support local economic development through public goods; to&#13;
manage the Community and Municipality Subprojects Subcomponent; and to manage the&#13;
funds that will be forthcoming later as part of the system of fiscal transfers for disadvantaged&#13;
municipalities. The sub-component includes two activities: (1) Creation/strengthening of&#13;
Municipal Technical Units; and (2) Training and technical assistance on project management&#13;
and municipal affairs.&#13;
All project municipalities have been classified relative to each other into one of&#13;
three categories (high-A, moderate-B, and low capacity-C) based on their administrative and&#13;
financial capacities and the presence of other enabling elements, e.g., NGOs, development&#13;
committees, etc. (see Table Al. 1).&#13;
Municipal Technical Units&#13;
Each municipal government would create a Municipal Technical Unit responsible&#13;
for project activities at the local level. The minimnum staffing of the MTU would include (1) a&#13;
project's specialist (engineer, agronomist, etc,); (2) a participation specialist; and (3) an&#13;
accountant/financial specialist. These staff could be existing staff assigned to those specific&#13;
tasks (in type A municipalities), new staff (in type C municipalities), or a combination (in type&#13;
B municipalities).(See Table Al. 1 for classification). One of these staff would be nominated&#13;
Local Project Coordinator and would be the main contact person for project activities.&#13;
The project would finance minor equipment and office upgrading, consultants,&#13;
incremental salaries and other recurrent costs to assist municipal with the following activities:&#13;
(1) recruitment of staff for and physical establishment of the MTUs; (2) operation of MTUs&#13;
for the execution of activities (1) to (13) below; (3) setting-up a subproject monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system; and (4) setting-up a system of financial controls and project accounts at the&#13;
municipal level.&#13;
The functions of the MTU (see Operational Manual), would include:&#13;
(1) promoting the project with beneficiaries;&#13;
(2) assisting communities set up and operate the Intercommunity Assembly and&#13;
the Community Supervision Committee;&#13;
(3) promoting, training and assisting Intercommunity Assembly with participatory&#13;
planning;&#13;
(4) preparing municipal investment plans (MIP) including financial cronogram;&#13;
(5) assisting communities and municipalities with project preparation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Page 3 of 21&#13;
(6) carrying out procurement activities on behalf of INIFOM, including&#13;
maintaining roster of local consultants and NGOs and assisting communities&#13;
with their recruitment;&#13;
(7) reviewing subproject documentation, appraise subprojects and make&#13;
recommendation to municipal council;&#13;
(8) detecting technical assistance needs of subproject proponents and assist them&#13;
with technical assistance plan;&#13;
(9) supervising all subprojects and issuing reports of physical advances;&#13;
(10) maintaining the municipal subproject monitoring system;&#13;
(11) preparing municipal technical assistance plans and channeling these to&#13;
INIFOM;&#13;
(12) reporting to INIFOM on the project's progress at the municipal level and&#13;
requesting disbursements into municipal accounts;&#13;
(13) maintaining project accounts at the municipal level;&#13;
Technical assistance and training for municipal government.&#13;
The project would finance consultants, seminars, workshops, study tours and other&#13;
training expenses for the MTUs and other municipal staff in the following thematic areas:&#13;
(1) the subproject cycle, including on the identification, preparation, appraisal,&#13;
implementation and operation of subprojects in various thematic areas;&#13;
(2) participatory methods including participatory planning;&#13;
(3) environment and land use plans and design and planning of rural development,&#13;
natural resources and enviromment programs;&#13;
(4) gender and indigenous peoples related issues;&#13;
(5) accounting, auditing and financial management related to the project and&#13;
municipal operation in general;&#13;
(6) subproject monitoring, evaluation and reporting;&#13;
(7) procurement for works, goods and consultants and NGOs at the local level;&#13;
(8) local revenue generation and cost recovery for maintenance activities;&#13;
(9) personnel recruitment and management;&#13;
(10) municipal administration;&#13;
(11) legal assistance&#13;
Agreement to receive training and/or technical assistance in the thematic areas (1)&#13;
through (7) would be a condition of municipal eligibility for the Community and Municipality&#13;
Subprojects Sub-component. These training programs would be organized and managed by&#13;
the Directorate of Technical Assistance of INIFOM, which would recruit consultants or NGOs&#13;
to provide the services and/or do the quality control over the programs. Training and technical&#13;
assistance on the thematic areas (8) through (11) would be demand driven. INIFOM would&#13;
receive demand from municipal governments in this area and recruit consultants or set up&#13;
training programs, pooling municipalities whenever possible.&#13;
(B) Information, Participation and Training (USS2.8 million)&#13;
The objectives of this subcomponent are (1) to make the rights and responsibilities&#13;
of communities and local governments widely known to increase the level of community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Page 4 of 21&#13;
control and local transparency and accountability; (2) to increase the supply of local technical&#13;
services to support communities and municipalities; and (3) to generate increased demand for&#13;
subprojects. This sub-component includes three activities: (1) promotion and dissemination of&#13;
project; (2) creation and operation of community participatory structures and participatory&#13;
planning; and (3) training of community leaders, NGOs and local consultants.&#13;
There would be two kinds of communities eligible for participatory planning and to&#13;
propose projects. For most population community would be defined as the "comarca" which&#13;
is the smallest geographical unit commonly recognized in Nicaragua. A typical comarca&#13;
includes about 100 families, while a municipality could have about 50 comarcas. For&#13;
indigenous communities, the indigenous traditional community structures would be treated as&#13;
commnunities for project purposes.&#13;
Promotion and dissemination of project at the local level&#13;
The project would finance consultants, dissemination materials, seminars,&#13;
workshops and travel expenses for the promotion and dissemination of the project at the&#13;
community level through town meetings, radio, TV, videos, written materials, other infornal&#13;
communication devices and seminars and workshops for community members, leaders and&#13;
notables. Promotion and dissemination activities would take place periodically and would&#13;
include at least the following thematic areas:&#13;
(1) Overall project description including objectives, components, resources and&#13;
responsibilities, aspects of operational manual and cronogram of&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(2) Community participation aspects including commnunity participatory&#13;
structures and participatory planning;&#13;
(3) Women and indigenous peoples issues;&#13;
(4) Environmental issues including role of environmental and land use plans;&#13;
(5) Examples of project successes and failures in other communities including&#13;
types of subprojects approved, procurement arrangements, subproject costs,&#13;
etc.&#13;
Promotion and dissemination activities would be the joint responsibility of MTUs&#13;
and INIFOM, which would recruit NGOs or consultants to assist with the process and develop&#13;
dissemination materials. A community member would be designated as project promoter at the&#13;
community level and would be the community focal point for promotion and dissemination.&#13;
Intercommunity Assembly and Community Supervision Committee and Participatory&#13;
Planning&#13;
The project would finance consultants and travel expenses to assist with the&#13;
creation and/or operation of the Intercommunity Assembly and the Community Supervision&#13;
Committee and with participatory planning events.&#13;
The Intercommunity Assembly is the key community structure at the municipal&#13;
level. It is composed of community representatives (comprising at least 70% of all the&#13;
communities within a municipality) and may include also representatives of local NGOs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Page 5 of 21&#13;
religious groups, producer associations, and local notables (priest, teacher, nurse, etc.) . The&#13;
key functions of the Intercommunity Assembly are:&#13;
(1) to priorize the needs of the various communities into an overall expression of&#13;
community needs and priorities at the municipal level and to solve conflicts&#13;
between different communities for project resources;&#13;
(2) to define the general strategy for rural development;&#13;
(3) to discuss, endorse and support the Municipal Investment Plan to be financed&#13;
by the project;&#13;
(4) to elect members of the Community Supervision Committee and to review&#13;
their reports.&#13;
The Community Supervision Committee is a small structure in charge of ensuring&#13;
that community interests and the interests of rural areas are adequately taken into account. It&#13;
will have the same number of members as tiue Municipal Council. Each member will be&#13;
elected for one year. The project will pay a small fixed fee per member for each meeting&#13;
attended to cover travel expenses and opportunity costs of labor. The key functions of the&#13;
Community Supervision Committee are:&#13;
(1) supervise project execution at the municipal level on behalf of communities;&#13;
(2) report to the Intercommunity Assembly and INIFOM on project execution and&#13;
issue certificates of sub-project completion to the MTU and INIFOM;&#13;
(3) oversee municipality/community agreements and compliance with project&#13;
objectives.&#13;
The activities related to the establishment and operation of the Intercommunity&#13;
Assembly and Community Supervision Committee would be jointly executed by the MTUs and&#13;
INIFOM, which would recruit consultants to assist with the process.&#13;
Participatory planning would be the process for prioritizing community problems&#13;
and needs and start suggesting solutions to these problems. Participatory planning would be&#13;
carried out by the community with facilitators which would include both the MTU and&#13;
consultants or NGOs recruited by INIFOM to assist with the process.&#13;
Community members would meet to carry out participatory planning exercises to&#13;
agree on needs and investment priorities and to elect community representatives to the&#13;
Intercommunity Assembly (IA). The MTU would integrate priorities of each community&#13;
within each municipality into a municipal investment plan (MIP), which could include also&#13;
projects identified by one or more municipal governments. The MTUs would also take into&#13;
account recommendations from the Environment and Land Use Plans (ELUP). MIPs would&#13;
be submitted to the Intercommunity Assembly (IA) for discussion and priorization of&#13;
investments among communities. The Community Supervision Committee (CSC) would be&#13;
responsible for advising the municipal government, monitoring the implementation of the&#13;
municipal investment plan and informing conmmunities of progress. The MIPs would be&#13;
approved by Municipal Councils and submitted to the Regional Delegation of INIFOM for&#13;
non-objection and confirmation of eligibility for IDA financing or for other financing sources.&#13;

Training for and Registry of Service Providers&#13;
The project would finance equipment, consultants, seminars, workshops, rental of&#13;
facilities, training materials, study tours and travel expenses for training programs (Pacific and&#13;
Atlantic) to build the capacity among relevant professionals of local NGOs, private sector and&#13;
government agencies on:&#13;
(1)  all aspects of the subproject cycle including identification, preparation,&#13;
appraisal, implementation and operation.&#13;
(2)  participatory planning, project identification and preparation methodologies in&#13;
the context of the proposed project;&#13;
(3)  technical aspects of natural resources and rural water projects subprojects and&#13;
on use and interpretation of environmental and land use plans;&#13;
(4)  application and transfer of technical systems for sustainable resource&#13;
management;&#13;
(5)  project and fund administration, management and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
The training program is designed to ensure that the professional skills of natural&#13;
resource management specialists and sub-project managers are adequate for sub-project needs.&#13;
This component is targeted at local NGOs, private sector and government operating at the&#13;
local level who must assist communities and municipalities with all aspects of the subproject&#13;
cycle from identification to operation and who will ultimately exert technical control over the&#13;
subprojects. In the past the provision of opportunity to maintain and/or upgrade the&#13;
professional skills of this group has been largely ignored.&#13;

Restrictions on subprojects. Consistently with the project's focus on rural&#13;
development through the provision of local public goods, poverty alleviation and environmental&#13;
protection, the following restrictions would apply:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Page 9 of 21&#13;
(1) subprojects in towns of more than 10,000 inhabitants do not qualify;&#13;
(2) at least 60% of funds invested annually are for sub-projects outside of the&#13;
head town of the municipality;&#13;
(3) activities of second-level organizations (e.g., NGOs, governnent line agencies,&#13;
universities, private sector firms, etc) which are not first requested by and&#13;
directly linked to municipalities, communities or community-level groups do&#13;
not qualify;&#13;
(4) activities which could cause irreversible environmental damage (e.g.,&#13;
conversion of forest to other uses; drainage of wetlands; channelization of&#13;
rivers and streams; use of agrochemicals with a WHO rating of 'A') would not&#13;
qualify;&#13;
(5) beneficiaries must be community organizations or groups of at least 10&#13;
households; individual activities do not qualify;&#13;
(6) subprojects otherwise financeable by banks or other lending institutions do not&#13;
qualify; compliance with this restriction would be checked during project&#13;
audits and supervision;&#13;
(7) the maximum cost per beneficiary is US$700.&#13;
Subproject cycle. Responsibilities over the subproject cycle would be the&#13;
following:&#13;
(1) Subproject identification The project ideas would have been defined and pre-&#13;
approved in the MIPs. The MTUs would assist communities with further&#13;
identification of projects for which the services of local private consultants,&#13;
NGOs or government officials qualified through the registry of service&#13;
providers could be contracted. The identification phase would also include&#13;
defining the Project User Group (PUG), those community members with a&#13;
stake in the subproject and that later would supervise or execute its&#13;
implementation, operation and maintenance.&#13;
(2) Subproject preparation Subproject preparation would be the responsibility&#13;
of the MTUs for municipality subprojects or MTUs and/or PUGs for&#13;
community subprojects. In most instances MTUs and legally established&#13;
communities would hire qualified private consultants, NGOs or government&#13;
agencies to assist communities and MTUs with project preparation. Projects&#13;
would cover the costs of consultants or travel expenses of government staff.&#13;
Projects would be prepared according to guidelines included in the Training&#13;
Manual and the project proposal would need to include a (a) management&#13;
plan; (b) operation, maintenance and, if the case, cost recovery plan; (c)&#13;
technical assistance plan; (d) co-financing p!an identifying sources of&#13;
financing; (e) simple monitorable indicators; and (f) the sub-project agreement&#13;
and other signed letters and agreements depending on the case and according&#13;
to the formats in the Operational Manual (Reglamento Interno).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Page 10of21&#13;
(3) Subproject appraisal and approval. The Municipal Technical Unit would&#13;
review all project proposals and recommend to the Municipal Council&#13;
approval, rejection or further preparation. The MC would approve all&#13;
subprojects that: (a) meet community priorities as outlined in MPs; (b)&#13;
include acceptable management, operation, cost recovery and technical&#13;
assistance plans; (c) include criteria for monitoring and evaluation; (d) are&#13;
technically sound; (e) include co-financing by beneficiaries and/or&#13;
municipalities; (f) meet environmental criteria; (g) fit poverty objectives; and&#13;
(h) target rural areas. All projects of US$25,000 or less would not require&#13;
further approval. All projects of US$50,000 of graduated municipalities&#13;
would not require further approval. Projects not under those thresholds would&#13;
have to be approved by INIFOM and environmentally cleared by MARENA.&#13;
For the appraisal of projects INIFOM would request the assistance of line&#13;
agencies - INTA, NRDP, INAA, FISE, MCT. - and could also recruit&#13;
consultants to assist with the appraisal.&#13;
(4) Subproject implementation. Subproject implementation would also be the&#13;
responsibility of the MTUs and communities. Projects could be either&#13;
implemented by legally established communities themselves, by contractors&#13;
recruited by the MTUs on behalf of communities, or by a combination of the&#13;
two. Project implementation would in specific cases include training on&#13;
project operation, maintenance and cost recovery. All projects would be&#13;
supervised by the MTU and communities and/or Project User Groups&#13;
established. All projects greater than US$50,000 and samples of smaller&#13;
projects would be also supervised by the Regional Delegation of INIFOM.&#13;
(5) Operation, maintenance and cost recovery. Operation, maintenance and&#13;
cost-recovery would be the responsibility of legally established communities&#13;
and/or municipal governments depending on the project and the particular&#13;
model to be adopted would be described in the project proposal. For the&#13;
specific case of productive projects, cost-recovery into community funds&#13;
would be promoted and the project would finance technical assistance and&#13;
training on the management of these funds. These rotating funds would be the&#13;
mechanisms for spreading the benefits of private goods projects over the&#13;
largest number of community members in order to avoid conflicts and build up&#13;
the social capital in communities.&#13;
Municipality eligibility&#13;
Municipal eligibility. To become eligible for the sub-projects municipalities would&#13;
have to enter into an eligibility and financing agreement with INIFOM (a sample is included in&#13;
the Draft Operational Manual) in which they agree, prior to eligibility for sub-project grants,&#13;
to:&#13;
(1) follow the rules in the Operational Manual;&#13;
(2) create or strengthen the Municipal Technical Unit;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Page 11 of 21&#13;
(3) establish project accounts and bring financial controls up to Bank standards as&#13;
per monitoring indicators and criteria and action plan presented in the&#13;
background document "Evaluaci6n/Diagn6stico Contable de 32 Municipios,&#13;
INIFOMy MARENA" which is in the project file;&#13;
(4) establish and operate a project monitoring and evaluation system as described&#13;
inAnnex 10;&#13;
(5) promote the project with communities and assist communities setting up and&#13;
operating the community structures and follow participatory planning methods&#13;
as discussed under Subcomponent (B);&#13;
(6) develop municipal investment plans respecting community priorities and the&#13;
environment and land use plans (ELUP) discussed below&#13;
(7) when specific financing is provided, signing imnplementation agreements for&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
Financing Ceilings. Financing ceilings play three roles: (1) by imposing a budget&#13;
constraint on municipal governments and communities they would force these to prioritize and&#13;
optimize their portfolio and to develop trade-off analysis and conflict resolution mechanisms,&#13;
in the process helping strengthen local decision-making structures; (2) they would avoid&#13;
biasing funding toward the larger and better situated municipalities which are more capable of&#13;
presenting sound subproject proposals; and (3) they would permit to better target project&#13;
resources toward meeting poverty and environmental objectives. Each year there would be a&#13;
financing ceiling per municipality calculated on the basis of a formula applied to a total annual&#13;
budget that increases from the first to the last year of the project. The results (in percentage)&#13;
are presented in Figure A1. 1. These caps will be reviewed and modified annually based on&#13;
performance and demand. The indicators and their weights are:&#13;
(1) poverty index, using the FISE index of "unsatisfied basic needs" - 42%;&#13;
(2) necessity index, using municipality's rural population as a proxy for necessity&#13;
- 34%;&#13;
(3) economic efficiency index using as proxies: municipal tax collections - 14%;&#13;
and the total community counterpart (in-kind and cash) from previous year's&#13;
municipal development investment program - 10%.&#13;
Penalties and incentives. See para 6.17 of the SAR for the proposed penalties and&#13;
incentives.&#13;
Local co-financing. All subprojects (with the exception of capacity building sub-&#13;
projects) would require matching funds from beneficiaries, whether farmner groups,&#13;
communities, NGOs or municipalities, in accordance with criteria listed in Table I of the SAR.&#13;
Environmental review of subprojects. The process for environrmental review of&#13;
sub-projects is discussed in the background document "Sistema de Procedimientos&#13;
Ambientales para la Gesti6n Ambiental Municipal" The environmental review of subprojects&#13;
would be carried out by the MTU for all subprojects and by the MTU and MARENA for&#13;
projects greater than US$50,000 or subprojects included in risk 1II category (see below). At&#13;
the Municipal-level technical unit staff would review preliminary proposals against pre-&#13;
determined inclusion and exclusion criteria and ascertain the proposal's coherence viz. the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

municipal environment and land use plans. Those passing this stage would be required to&#13;
complete a simple form which describes project activities, geographic location of each activity&#13;
and the presence of sensitive areas (rivers, protected areas, forests, etc), and which explicitly&#13;
defines the projects consistency with the ELUP and national environmental legislation; and&#13;
how subproject interventions would be maintained following subproject completion.&#13;

MTUs would categorize the subproject based on Decree 45/95. Projects would be&#13;
classified as: (1) Category I - subprojects without negative environmental impact; does not&#13;
require an EA; (2) Category II - subprojects with limited potential negative impact; requires&#13;
an EA; explicit approval not required; (3) Category III - requires a full ETA and environmental&#13;
management plan, completed by a qualified professional and approval by MARENA. For&#13;
category I and II proposals, the MTU could assign up to 20% of total estimated microproject&#13;
cost to contract the required work. In the case of microprojects with environmental analyses&#13;
and/or need for MARENA approval, the MTU would be responsible to obtain that approval.&#13;
Table A1. 13 lists the main environmental risks associated with subproject categories.&#13;
Subproject Operation Phase: The major environmental issues during operation&#13;
would relate to soil erosion, soil nutrient management, agrochemical usage, natural forest&#13;
management, and overexploitation of resources. The following measures would be taken to&#13;
reduce risks and avoid or mitigate the potential negative impacts:&#13;
(1) a project-wide, four year, ongoing training and technical assistance program&#13;
targeted at all natural resource professionals and higher/mid-level technicians&#13;
in the project areas on the subproject cycle would include compliance with&#13;
environmental norms and regulations and best management practices to meet&#13;
them. This would include a review of implementation experiences and&#13;
systemization of best management practices for dissemination by INTA and&#13;
project activities;&#13;
(2) subprojects with environmental risks would include a TA plan;&#13;
(3) subprojects would include (a) financing of formal/informal environmental&#13;
education programs to raise key local issues to the level of public debate and&#13;
educate populace on altematives and trade-offs; and (b) financing of applied&#13;
research activities to address specific concerns such as: adapted crop varieties;&#13;
soil/crop specific fertilizer trials to rationalize usage; validation of IPM&#13;
practices; and monitoring of regenerative capacities of managed resources;&#13;
(4) annual independent reviews of selected microprojects in each municipality,&#13;
which include technical and environmental audits.&#13;
(D) Strengthening of INIFOM (US$3.3 million).&#13;
The objectives of this sub-component are to help develop: (I) the conditions in&#13;
INIFOM to implement the component and (2) a legal framework to ensure project&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
Strengthening of INIFOM&#13;
The project would finance minor office works, equipment, consultants, studies,&#13;
seminars and workshops, study tours and incremental salaries and other recurrent costs for the:&#13;
(1) Directorate of Planning which will be responsible for implementation of the&#13;
Rural Municipality Development Component; the project will cover the costs&#13;
of a Planning Advisor, Procurement Advisor, Accountant and&#13;
Disbursements Officer and Project Auditor.&#13;

Component II. Natural Resources Policy and Institutions&#13;
Background and Rationale&#13;
The Natural Resources Policies and Institutions Component was designed to&#13;
increase the capacity at the central government level to ensure that public and private&#13;
actors internalize environmental concerns in their decisions. This is particularly&#13;
important in the context of the decentralization process to local governments and&#13;
communities supported by component I. Local institutions are known for inadequately&#13;
considering the costs of their actions on other jurisdictions, and this is particularly so in&#13;
the case of the environment where there are substantial regional, national and global&#13;
externalities. Hence it is necessary for central government to keep track of these effects&#13;
and through a variety of instruments prevent local jurisdictions from taking actions that&#13;
cause more harm on others than the benefits that accrue to them.&#13;
The second important consideration in the design of both this component and&#13;
of component III - the associated Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor Project to be financed by&#13;
GEF - was to assist government in putting in place a legal and institutional framework&#13;
that would create the necessary conditions, as stated in Bank policies, for future Bank&#13;
supported investment projects in the natural resources sectors, and in particular in&#13;
forestry and coastal zone management.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The key objective of this component is to ensure that GON and local&#13;
institutions and communities take into account important regional, national and global&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

environment aspects in their decisions by improving the policy and institutional&#13;
framework for natural resources.&#13;
Component Description&#13;
This component consists of a small technical assistance program covering&#13;
two different areas: (A) strengthening of MARENA; and (B) interinstitutional&#13;
assistance program.&#13;
(A) Strengthening of MARENA (US$3.0 million)&#13;
The objective of this subcomponent is to increase the institutional capacity of&#13;
MARENA in the areas of (1) policy; (2) environmental planning and monitoring; and (3)&#13;
protected area management. The environmental planning and monitoring activities would&#13;
help develop an information system identifying critical environmental risks at the local&#13;
level that will be used to assist municipal governments with their investment decisions&#13;
under component I and that will enable MARENA to object to risky investments for the&#13;
environment in the context of components I and III. The project would finance&#13;
equipment, minor office upgrading, consultants, seminars and workshops, study tours&#13;
and incremental salaries and operating costs for:&#13;
(1) Strengthening the recently created Directorate of Planning and within it&#13;
the Divisions of Policy, Planning and Interinstitutional Relations and&#13;
the Directorate of Protected Areas. The project would finance&#13;
advisors in international agreements, participation, indigenous issues,&#13;
and NGOs, policy and protected area management.&#13;
(2) Advice, studies, consultations and dissemination for the elaboration of&#13;
legal proposals, regulations and studies covering the following themes:&#13;
(a) regulation of General Environment Law; (b) proposal and regulation&#13;
of a Protected Area and/or Biodiversity Law; (c) proposal and&#13;
regulation of a Forestry Law; (d) contributions to the proposal and&#13;
regulation of a Fishery Law; (e) legal or regulatory initiatives for the&#13;
harmonization of decentralization, natural resources and indigenous&#13;
peoples legislation; (g) analysis of relations between rural poverty and&#13;
environmental degradation and other unidentified studies.&#13;
(3) Strenghtening the Regional Delegations of MARENA in Le6n and&#13;
Chinandega and in the Atlantic region to enable them to perform their&#13;
functions under the project in support of components I and III.&#13;
(4) Elaboration, consultations and dissemination of Municipal&#13;
Environment and Land Use Plans (3 plans) for Le6n, Chinandega and&#13;
San Carlos. The ELUPs are an important contribution to the Municipal&#13;
Development Component as they will make information available to&#13;
local governments and communities regarding environmental risks and&#13;
threats and areas of highest potential productivity.&#13;
(5) Elaboration, consultations and dissemination of an Environment and&#13;
Land Use Plan for the Atlantic including the delineation of the Atlantic&#13;
Biodiversity Corridor (see Component III). The Atlantic ELUP will be a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Page 18 of 21&#13;
law information tool for MARENA to advise other government agencies&#13;
on the environmental risks from investments such as roads, forests and&#13;
mining concessions and will also guide investment decisions in the&#13;
Atlantic under component I.&#13;
(6) An informal Environment Threats Monitoring System based on&#13;
infornation to be provided by local governments, indigenous and non-&#13;
indigenous communities and local representatives of central agencies.&#13;
The environment and land use plans would start at the beginning of the&#13;
project. Supported by national level land use and soils data, upon project startup in each&#13;
participating municipality, the project would finance a Municipal-level process, the&#13;
objective of which would be to bring together municipal government, technical&#13;
professionals, communities, NGOs, cooperatives, associations, etc., to: (1) prioritize&#13;
natural resource protection, conservation, and management needs; (2) identify geographic&#13;
and thematic opportunities for enhancing income through improved resource management&#13;
within those needs; (3) identify positive experiences with technologies and systems in the&#13;
zone for natural resource protection, conservation, and management needs and for&#13;
enhancing income through improved resource management; (4) diagnose specific areas&#13;
and needs for training and capacitation of professionals and technicians in order&#13;
implement priority activities; and (5) identify and map areas subject to specific&#13;
environmental risks. As part of the process, multidisciplinary teamns would be contracted&#13;
to carry out field diagnostics, including the identification of environmentally sensitive or&#13;
critical zones. The output from this process would be an instrument to be utilized in the&#13;
local microproject approval process.&#13;
(B) Inter-institutional Assistance Program (US$2.1 million)&#13;
The NEAP identified lack of capacity to design, implement and&#13;
enforce environmental policy as the key problem underlying environmental&#13;
degradation in Nicaragua and called for an integrated program of multi-&#13;
institutional support to increase capacity of several agencies in Nicaragua to&#13;
handle environmental issues. The objective of this component is to increase the&#13;
capacity of MARENA to assist other government agencies with implementation&#13;
and enforcement of environmental policies.&#13;
The project would finance consultants, seminars and workshops, study&#13;
tours and minor equipment to assist MARENA in providing technical support&#13;
services to the (1) National Assembly on elaboration or review of legislative&#13;
proposals related to natural resources and environment and related topics; (2)&#13;
Judiciary on developing curricula, training trainers, developing training materials&#13;
and training of about sixty Supreme Court and other judges on environmental&#13;
matters; (3) Office of the Attorney General with the establishment of an&#13;
Environmental Affairs Unit; (4) police environmental units on developing&#13;
curricula, training trainers and developing training materials on control of illegal&#13;
logging, wildlife trade and contamination from mining and other industries; (5)&#13;
army environmental units on developing curricula, training trainers and&#13;
developing training materials on monitoring of turtle landings, forest fires control&#13;
and monitoring of resource degradation and protected areas; (6) legal offices of&#13;
central government agencies on training and technical assistance on&#13;

municipal governments on training trainers, developing training materials,&#13;

natural resource and environmental management, including local natural resource&#13;
taxation and environmental planning.&#13;
Component III. Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor&#13;
Background and Rationale&#13;
The Atlantic slope of Nicaragua is biologically an extremely rich area of&#13;
lowland tropical rain forests, coastal wetlands, pine savannas, and higher altitude pine-&#13;
oak forests. These ecoregions and ecosystems have high global importance on their own&#13;
merits, but in addition, they form part of a critical link in a larger Mesoamerican&#13;
Biological Corridor (MBC) linking North America, Central America, and South&#13;
America. Although this area in Nicaragua is one of the most intact natural areas&#13;
remaining in Central America, there is no assurance that key components will be&#13;
protected in the long-term as part of a viable protected areas system. It is now threatened&#13;
by colonists spilling over to the Atlantic from Nicaragua's more densely inhabited Pacific&#13;
slope.&#13;
The Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor (ABC) represents the Nicaraguan portion&#13;
of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Support for an ABC has long been a national&#13;
priority in Nicaragua. The Tropical Forestry Action Plan and the National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan, both completed in the early 1990's, explicitly recognized the&#13;
importance of strengthening protected areas in the Atlantic slope and maintaining the&#13;
intactness of this last large area of natural habitat in Central America. Nicaragua's&#13;
Ministry of the Environment (MARENA) has issued a draft version of the country's&#13;
Biodiversity Strategy and this document is now undergoing a process of public&#13;
consultation. The Strategy document identifies the ABC as a top national biodiversity&#13;
priority.&#13;
There is widespread concern among national, regional, and local governments&#13;
that the current patterns of frontier development on the Atlantic slope are unsustainable,&#13;
non-economic and are the source of substantial social problems. Moreover, there is&#13;
insufficient control over logging and mining concessions in the region, in part because&#13;
Nicaragua has not yet put in place the legal and institutional framework to minimize&#13;
environmental risks from these activities, which could become potentially important in&#13;
the Atlantic. More importantly there are serious issues of indigenous land and natural&#13;
resources tenure.&#13;
Large portions of these ecoregions in the proposed ABC are presently&#13;
included in protected areas. However, in most of these protected areas, there are no&#13;
management activities, protection is weak or non-existent, the legal status is unclear,&#13;
there is legal confusion over indigenous rights and responsabilities and the actual&#13;
boundaries on the ground are ill-defined and unmarked. Support for protected areas and&#13;
their buffer zones in this part of Nicaragua is being provided by a variety of donors and&#13;
aid agencies including USAID, GTZ, the European Union, the Danish, Dutch, Canadian,&#13;
and Austrian governnents, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), World Wildlife Fund&#13;
(WWF), the Caribbean Conservation Corporation, and others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Page 20 of 21&#13;
Objectives&#13;
This component (associated project) seeks to ensure the long-term&#13;
conservation and sustainable use of the biodiversity resources of an Atlantic Biodiversity&#13;
Corridor (ABC) through the Atlantic slope of Nicaragua. Such a corridor would be a&#13;
critical link in a larger Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC). The Nicaraguan&#13;
ecoregions and ecosystems within the proposed ABC have high global importance on&#13;
their own merits and as a whole, represent the most intact natural habitats remaining in&#13;
Central America.&#13;
Component Description&#13;
To achieve the objectives outlined above, the proposed project is organized&#13;
into three components. The definition of the ABC itself is one face of a multi-faceted land&#13;
use strategy for the entire Atlantic slope. This planning exercise, taking into account both&#13;
biological and socioeconormic considerations, is currently being undertaken with GON&#13;
and GEF Project Development Fund (PDF) resources. The three components are:&#13;
(A) Involvement of Local Communities, Indigenous Groups, NGOs and&#13;
Governments in Biodiversity Management&#13;
The project would finance consultants and training for: (i) development of and&#13;
promoting the project with indigenous and non-indigenous communities in the Atlantic&#13;
region; (ii) training indigenous and non-indigenous communities in sustainable&#13;
biodiversity use and protection; (iii) assisting indigenous committees in pursuing formal&#13;
recognition for their land and natural resources rights; (iv) training and technical&#13;
assistance to NGOs, and municipal and regional governments for the implementation of&#13;
the ABC strategy; and (v) training of central government agencies on the ABC strategy.&#13;
An Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) is currently under preparation.&#13;
(B) Biodiversity Planning, Information, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
The project would finance equipment, consultants, studies, workshops, training&#13;
and dissemination materials, travel expenses and incremental salaries and other recurrent&#13;
costs for (i) continuing the ABC planning activities; (ii) implementing a biodiversity&#13;
monitoring system in coordination with communities and local and regional governments&#13;
to warn of threats to biodiversity; and (iii) establishing a system for evaluating potential&#13;
impacts on the ABC of development activities such as roads and other infrastructure and&#13;
logging, mining and fishing concessions and for proposing and enforcing mitigating&#13;
measures.&#13;
(C) Financial Mechanism for the Sustainability of the ABC2&#13;
The project would finance equipment, consultants, training, workshops,&#13;
seminars, studies and study tours for: (i) the operation of a financing mechanism to&#13;
promote the long-term sustainability of the ABC including fund rising; and (ii) grants for&#13;
sub-projects covering the following themes:&#13;
2      The nature of the financing mechanism Nill be defined during preparation of this&#13;
component.&#13;

management plans and recurrent costs related to the maintenance of the&#13;
protected areas of Bosawas, Cayos Miskitos and Indio-Maiz and other&#13;
protected areas identified as being of high global and national importance.&#13;
* Subprojects of sustainable use of biodiversity submitted by indigenous and&#13;
non-indigenous communities, municipalities, NGOs and the private sector&#13;
for areas included in the ABC in a way similar to the matching grants&#13;
described under the Rural Municipalities Component. Matching grants&#13;
would only finance subprojects that have a clear positive impact on&#13;
biodiversity and the integrity of the ABC, including training and technical&#13;
assistance for communities in biodiversity protection and sustainable uses,&#13;
demarcation of key areas, biodiversity monitoring and inventories, vigilance&#13;
systems, environmental education, ecotourism, sustainable uses of&#13;
biodiversity, etc. These subprojects could be financed as quid pro quo&#13;
agreements. For example, in exchange for an indigenous community&#13;
agreement to patrol and monitor threats to biodiversity in their traditional&#13;
lands, the subproject could finance community basic needs such as water,&#13;
seeds, etc. More traditional community development projects not specifically&#13;
tied to biodiversity would be eligible for financing under the Rural&#13;
Municipalities Component.&#13;
- Subprojects of demarcation of indigenous territories submitted by indigenous&#13;
communities.&#13;

ANNEX 5&#13;
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES STRATEGY FOR THE ATLANTIC REGION&#13;
1. OVERVIEW OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES&#13;
In 1993, the estimated indigenous population of Nicaragua was 231,727&#13;
inhabitants, representing 5.2 percent of the total. The greatest concentration of indigenous&#13;
people is found in the Atlantic region where Miskito, Sumu, Rama and Garifona peoples live.&#13;
The Miskito, with over 110,00 people, are the most numerous of indigenous peoples. In fact,&#13;
in 1993, they represented over 58 percent of the population of the North Atlantic region and&#13;
close to 48 percent of the total indigenous population of the country. In contrast, in the Pacific&#13;
region, there are also several indigenous peoples, among them the Subtiaba, Monimb6,&#13;
Matagalpa, Sebaco and Jinotega, but they are not as numerous as those in the Atlantic.&#13;
In the heavily populated Pacific and Northern regions indigenous groups have had&#13;
for a long timne to adapt to the dominant non-indigenous populations and have lost access to&#13;
some of their traditional lands and cultural identity. In the Atlantic Coast, on the other hand,&#13;
with a low population density and vast areas of pristine habitats, indigenous peoples for the&#13;
most part still have access to their traditional territories and have been able to maintain the&#13;
essence of their traditional lifestyles.&#13;
A fundamental issue that needs to be solved in Nicaragua relates to indigenous land&#13;
and natural resources rights. Clarifying these rights could go a long way in contributing to&#13;
economic growth in Nicaragua. Until indigenous land and natural resources rights issues are&#13;
solved in the resource rich Atlantic it will be impossible for Nicaragua to pursue careful&#13;
exploitation and sustainable use of its minerals, forests and fishery. Potential investors will be&#13;
scared away, resource values will not be maximized, and conflict and gridlock will prevent&#13;
indigenous communities from benefiting fully from resource use and GON from enforcing&#13;
important environmental regulations.&#13;
The problem is not one of Nicaragua's willingness to advance in the recognition of&#13;
indigenous land and natural resources rights. To the contrary, public statements and recent&#13;
initiatives demonstrate that there is good will in working towards a solution to these problems.&#13;
But due to the less acute social problems in the Atlantic and the formidable task of building a&#13;
democracy in a war ravaged and very poor country, indigenous issues have not been a top&#13;
priority and efforts have been channeled instead towards land tenure and titling, poverty&#13;
alleviation and demobilization of soldiers elsewhere in the country. Moreover, given the&#13;
limited capacity of specialized institutions to address the many policy and legal inconsistencies&#13;
affecting indigenous peoples rights, advances have been slow.&#13;

2. OBSTACLES TO THE RECOGNITION OF INDIGENOUS LAND AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCES RIGHTS IN THE ATLANTIC'&#13;
MARENA commissioned two studies to (i) identify main obstacles for advancing&#13;
with the recognition of indigenous land and natural resource rights contemplated in the&#13;
Constitution; and (ii) to propose a strategy/action plan for the government for removing those&#13;
obstacles. These studies were commissioned as part of the Indigenous Peoples Development&#13;
Plan for the Atlantic which is required before appraisal of the GEF component (see below).&#13;
The main conclusions/recommendations of these studies are briefly summarized below.&#13;
The Legal And Institutional Context&#13;
There are good prospects for the recognition of indigenous land and natural&#13;
resources rights in the Atlantic:&#13;
*  There is a solid constitutional and legal basis in the Constitution and&#13;
Autonomy Law of 1987 that guarantees the rights of indigenous communities&#13;
of the Atlantic to their traditional territories and natural resources contained in&#13;
them.&#13;
-  There is a clear political will, expressed by various GON agencies and the&#13;
President of the Republic, to advance with the recognition of the traditional&#13;
rights of indigenous communities over land and use and management of natural&#13;
resources in those lands.&#13;
*  There is a high level of awareness in the indigenous communities themselves&#13;
over their territorial rights as a historical and legal commitment of the State&#13;
and an understanding that these rights entail substantial autonomy in the&#13;
management of community matters and use and disposition of natural&#13;
resources.&#13;
*  There is a clear political and administrative conscience of regional governments&#13;
of the importance of recognizing traditional indigenous land rights consistently&#13;
with historical commitments and existing norms.&#13;
*  There are solid indigenous organizations and indigenous representations at the&#13;
level of municipal and regional governments that will facilitate the process of&#13;
recognizing indigenous land claims.&#13;
Main Limitations and Difficulties&#13;
There are legal, admrinistrative, technical, socio-economic and cultural obstacles to&#13;
advancing with the recognition of indigenous land and natural resources rights.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Strategy for the Atlantic Region&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
Legally the main obstacles are the following:&#13;
*  There is no legal scheme defined in the agrarian or indigenous legislation prior&#13;
to the Constitution and Autonomy Law of 1987 for the administration of&#13;
community lands, other than the one specified under the Civil Code and in&#13;
various laws and decrees published since the beginning of the century and&#13;
which were applied to the different situation of indigenous conmmunities of the&#13;
Pacific. This Civil Code model (communal property) represents a contract&#13;
between community members as co-owners of an asset, but is insufficient for&#13;
the administration of a territory historically belonging to a culturally&#13;
differentiated group, as is the case with communities in the Atlantic. The 1987&#13;
Autonomy Law, on the other hand, contemplated the indigenous community&#13;
land property right as inalienable and indescriptable and not subject to sale,&#13;
donation, seizure or attachment.&#13;
*  There is no clarity as to the competencies over property rights, use and&#13;
management of natural resources between Central Government, regional&#13;
governments and indigenous communities. There are, however, dispersed&#13;
throughout various pieces of legislation, enough elements to permit a&#13;
clarification of most legal issues affecting indigenous property and natural&#13;
resources. Unfortunately this process of legal clarification has not yet taken&#13;
place in Nicaragua.&#13;
T [NRA is the public entity in charge of titling of agrarian lands and of&#13;
redistributing national lands and "tierras baldfas". The agrarian reform titles&#13;
issued by INRA have all the restrictions applicable cable to agrarian reform&#13;
(size, intended use, etc.). However, in no agrarian legislation is INRA&#13;
explicitly given responsibility over assigning commnunity lands to indigenous&#13;
communities under community titles. Hence, although the 1995 Constitution&#13;
and the 1987 Autonomy Law recognize indigenous rights, there is no agency&#13;
explicitly in charge of executing community titles, nor have procedures been&#13;
defined for demarcation and titling or certification.&#13;
*  There may exist discrepancies between the municipality, a&#13;
geographic/administrative unit, and the indigenous territory, subject to its own&#13;
community government, once these are created.&#13;
*  There may exist conflicts between community natural resources rights obtained&#13;
through the process of recognition of community lands and the restrictions&#13;
associated with various types of protected areas when these overlap with&#13;
indigenous communities.&#13;
*  There are no clear procedures for granting juridical personality to communities.&#13;
Administratively, lack of procedures for recognizing indigenous land titles creates&#13;
a climate of uncertainty that affects key GON agencies with responsibilities that interact with&#13;
indigenous communities in the Atlantic, namely INRA, MARENA, MAS and regional&#13;
governments. Although all these institutions need to participate in the process of recognizing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Strategy for the Atlantic Region&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
community lands, the responsibilities and administrative roles of each one have not been&#13;
defined.&#13;
Technically, there is no definition of the traditional communal lands of each group&#13;
nor an inventory of the Atlantic regarding its resources and most appropriate land use. This is&#13;
important to estimate the size of the territories needed by communities to ensure subsistence.&#13;
There are different views regarding the types of territorial or land rights that should be&#13;
recognized to communities: by community, by ethnic group, by watershed. There is no&#13;
definition of the most appropriate methods for measuring territories: traditional topography,&#13;
aerophotography, mapping or a combination of these.&#13;
Socially, there is no clarity over how to handle the cases of minority communities&#13;
that have already lost some of their territories, either because traditional lands were assigned to&#13;
settlers or occupied by other indigenous communities. There is an incomplete inventory,&#13;
although some inforrnation does exist, about conflicts between different indigenous&#13;
communities or groups of communities in particular regarding the use of trails and natural&#13;
resources in the areas claimed. Such an inventory is essential for the definition of conflict&#13;
resolution mechanisms as part of the procedures for legal recognition of indigenous land titles.&#13;
Culturally, there is lack of information about the community organization and&#13;
government that would facilitate the definition of the management model for lands under&#13;
commnunity and the customary law management.&#13;
Key recommendations for government&#13;
The study's key recommendations for GON were the following:&#13;
(1) To finalize the collection and analysis of legal instruments related to&#13;
indigenous land and natural resource rights, including (i) treaties and&#13;
agreements with foreign governments; (ii) Constitutional texts, laws, decrees&#13;
and other legal initiatives of the State that affect the lifestyle of indigenous&#13;
communities, and traditional forms of government and land tenure; (iii)&#13;
decisions of the judicial system related to the rights of indigenous&#13;
communities; (iv) official opinions of central government on the matter; and&#13;
(v) agrarian legislation applied to indigenous communities of the Pacific.&#13;
(partially done in background study)&#13;
(2) To carry out a complete inventory of all land titles granted in the Atlantic for&#13;
both indigenous and non-indigenous inhabitants and in particular titles granted&#13;
under the Harrison-Altmirano Treaty, Agrarian Reform titles, and titles&#13;

(6) To propose a law defining the property regime for indigenous conmnunities&#13;
referred to in Article 107 of the Constitution (tentatively referred to in here as&#13;
the Indigenous Land Law) and clarifying the rights that indigenous&#13;
communities in their lands have over forests, water, wildlife, etc.&#13;
(7) To clarify the responsibilities and obligations of indigenous commnunities, the&#13;
regional government and MARENA in the administration of natural resources&#13;
in indigenous lands and include these responsibilities in the proposed&#13;
Indigenous Land Law and in legislation affecting natural resources.&#13;
(8) To review various legislative initiatives related to natural resources (forestry,&#13;
water, fisheries, protected areas, energy, etc.) to more precisely define aspects&#13;
with implications for indigenous peoples and ensure consistency with their&#13;
constitutional rights.&#13;
(9) To define the procedures for legally recognizing indigenous land rights,&#13;
defining responsibilities, community participation, etc., including procedures&#13;
for legally recognizing indigenous communities.&#13;
(10) To create a special structure involving several agencies under INRA&#13;
leadership and including regional support committees and a technical support&#13;
group in charge of preparing and reviewing proposals for decisions over the&#13;
various indigenous land cases and to ensure coordination between the various&#13;
GON agencies and regional governments in the process.&#13;
4. GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH INDIGENOUS LAND&#13;
AND NATURAL RESOURCES RIGHTS&#13;
Government's Action Plan&#13;
GON is presently discussing the results of the studies mentioned above as well as&#13;
other similar studies commissioned by INRA and plans to carry out workshops to generate a&#13;
broad consensus over priorities for action and assignment of institutional responsibilities for&#13;
their execution. This Action Plan, expected to be completed before appraisal of the GEF&#13;
project, and to constitute an integral part of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan being&#13;
prepared under the GEF component, would be supported by IDA through country dialogue in&#13;
the context of the CAS due in 1997, and by on-going and proposed operations namely (i) the&#13;
Agricultural Technology and Land Management Project (Credit No. 2536-NI); (ii) the&#13;
Nicaragua Indigenous Peoples IDF Grant No. 028902; (iii) the proposed IDA financed&#13;
project; and (iv) the proposed GEF financed project. Preparation funds for the GEF project&#13;
would help finance the workshops for the preparation of the Action Plan.&#13;
Country dialogue&#13;
The issue of how to support GON in the medium-term (1997-2000) in advancing&#13;
with the recognition of indigenous land rights would be discussed in the context of the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy due in FY97. If needed and agreed by GON and IDA the FY97 CAS&#13;
would more specifically detail the future IDA strategy for assisting GON with this issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Strategy for the Atlantic Region&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
Agricultural Technology and Land Management Project (Credit No. 2536-NI)&#13;
INRA, one of the two implementing agencies of this on-going project, is completing&#13;
an action plan for solving technical, legal and procedural obstacles to recognition of&#13;
indigenous land rights and awarding of indigenous titles and is also carrying out a diagnostic&#13;
study of indigenous people in the Atlantic region. INRA is likely to be the lead agency chosen&#13;
for advancing with this issue although it needs to be supported through a higher level&#13;
comrnmission including other GON agencies, narnely MARENA, MAS, INETER and Regional&#13;
Governments and representatives of key stakeholders. INRA is presently reprogramming its&#13;
activities in the context of the on-going project to give a higher priority to indigenous land&#13;
titling during its second phase, which is about to start.&#13;
Indigenous Peoples IDF Grant No. 028902&#13;
The Indigenous Peoples Grant being implemented by MAS includes training and&#13;
workshops for indigenous peoples on a variety of issues. Aspects of indigenous land and&#13;
natural resources rights are being included in the thematic topics covered.&#13;
Proposed IDA and GEF projects&#13;
As discussed elsewhere in this report the proposed project includes two distinct&#13;
operations to be processed under separate project cycles: the Municipal Development&#13;
Component and the Natural Resources and Policies Component, to be supported by IDA, and&#13;
the Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor Component, to be supported by GEF. For ease of&#13;
exposition the IDA components will be referred to as the IDA project and the ABC component&#13;
as the GEF project. Geographically the proposed IDA project is split between the Westem&#13;
Region (Le6n and Chinandega), where 90% of the community investments would take place,&#13;
and the Atlantic Region with 10% or US$2.5 million ear-mark-ed for community development&#13;
activities. The GEF project would take place entirely in the Atlantic and would be the main&#13;
mechanisms for channeling funds for this region. The reason for the split of the IDA project is&#13;
because IDA project funds are needed for the Atlantic for assistance to indigenous&#13;
conmmunities with their development needs. Only 10% are allocated to the Atlantic because the&#13;
region is sparsely populated, people are less poor than in the Western region, and local&#13;
implementation capacity is more limited.&#13;
Consistently with the proposed calendar for the IDA and GEF projects, GON&#13;
decided during preparation to carry out a Social Assessment/Indigenous Peoples Development&#13;
Plan for the IDA project focused on Leon and Chinandega. The Social Assessment/Indigenous&#13;
Peoples Development Plan for the Atlantic would be carried out as part of preparation for the&#13;
GEF project. This split was necessary in light of the different timing of the two operations and&#13;
the need to better define the GEF project, including the delineation of the biodiversity corrioor,&#13;
before a meaningful Social Assessment/IPDP could be developed. IDA disbursements for&#13;
subprojects in the Atlantic would be conditional on the GEF project becoming effective,&#13;
including the subrnission to IDA/GEF of an acceptable Indigenous Peoples Development Plan&#13;
for the Atlantic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Strategy for the Atlantic Region&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
Proposed GEF project&#13;
The GEF project would benefit indigenous communities as well as benefit from&#13;
their activities. Sustainable use of natural resources by indigenous peoples is consistent with&#13;
conservation of biodiversity and indigenous peoples would benefit from increased&#13;
environmental protection since this would reduce the threats on their resources from logging,&#13;
mining and fishing interests. The GEF project, which includes protected areas in the Atlantic,&#13;
raises some issues, however, related to indigenous peoples traditional natural resource use&#13;
rights in the context of biodiversity protection inside and outside of protected areas, and thus&#13;
includes two specific components to address these issues.&#13;
First, protection of biodiversity in indigenous traditional territories inside or outside&#13;
protected areas in the Atlantic would be achieved through quid pro quo agreements with&#13;
indigenous communities which have historical rights to vast areas to be included in the&#13;
biodiversity corridor. Second, a project component would finance activities to involve&#13;
indigenous communities in biodiversity protection and to assist them with community land&#13;
demarcation and natural resource management plans.&#13;
The Social Assessment/Indigenous Peoples Development Plan for the Atlantic&#13;
would comprise four main parts: (i) an analysis of the legal framework affecting indigenous&#13;
peoples, review of their organizations and institutional responsibilities, already completed (see&#13;
report entitled "Viabilidad y Condiciones Legales de Cunmplimiento de un Componente de&#13;
Legalizacion de Tierras a las Comunidades Indigenas de la Costa Atl6ntica dentro del&#13;
Proyecto de Manejo de Recursos Naturales" by Roque Roldan summarized above); (ii) an&#13;
Action Plan being developed by GON through workshops for prioritizing next steps in&#13;
addressing the legal constraints mainly for land titling and assigning institutional&#13;
responsibilities for their execution (see above); (iii) a participation plan to fully involve&#13;
indigenous communities in the design and implementation of the GEF component; and (iv) a&#13;
social assessment including rapid rural appraisals of non-indigenous communities in the&#13;
Atlantic and a participation plan for these communities.&#13;
Proposed IDA project&#13;
The proposed IDA project does not pose noticeable risks for indigenous&#13;
communities. On the contrary, although not specifically targeting indigenous communities, it&#13;
has built in mechanisms to give indigenous communities equal access to the project's resources&#13;
as non-indigenous communities and to support and strengthen all rural communities.&#13;
Nevertheless a Social Assessment/Indigenous Peoples Development Plan for the Sutiaba&#13;
community in Leon was carried out during the preparation of the proposed project to improve&#13;
the design of the participatory mechanisms included in the project. The results of the Social&#13;
Assessment/IPDP for Leon and Chinandega were summarized in Annex 3.&#13;
The technical assistance program to be managed by MARENA would include&#13;
improving the policy framework for natural resources including contributions to legislative&#13;
proposals under discussion in Nicaragua consistent with the constitutional rights of indigenous&#13;
communities and the constitutional principles of decentralization. The results of the studies&#13;
and analysis to be supported by the project would be disseminated, consulted and discussed&#13;
through workshops and other events with civic society. The IDA project would support a&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Indigenous Peoples Strategy for the Atlantic Region&#13;
Page 8 of 8&#13;
person in MARENA in charge of participation and relations with NGOs and an indigenous&#13;
expert responsible for interaction with indigenous commnunities.&#13;
The technical assistance program (IDA and GEF) would also finance a land use&#13;
plan for the Atlantic that would include land use potentials and a preliminary identification of&#13;
indigenous traditional territories (IDA project budget:USS 120,000). This plan, which would&#13;
be approved by INETER, the agency officially responsible for demarcation of indigenous&#13;
territories, would be extensively consulted and discussed with indigenous communities and&#13;
regional governnents. The program also includes budget for studies of social and indigenous&#13;
issues to be carried out during the project's first year (total budget US$155,000).&#13;
The possibility of extending the IDA project investment activities (Rural&#13;
Municipalities Development Component) to the entire RAAN and RAAS for the benefit of&#13;
indigenous communities was included in project design (total budget: US$2.3 million) subject&#13;
to the GEF project becoming effective, and the submission to IDA of an Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plan. An Environmental and Land Use Plan acceptable to IDA is also scheduled&#13;
to be completed by December 31, 1997. Although financial resources are not the key&#13;
constraint to the process of recognizing indigenous land and natural resource rights, the&#13;
proposed IDA project would make funds available to communities for a wide range of&#13;
subprojects to be proposed by the communities themselves, including technical and legal&#13;
assistance for the elaboration of community demarcation and natural resource management&#13;
proposals. These funds would be available both to indigenous communities in the Atlantic&#13;
region and to the Sutiaba in Le6n. This project component also includes funds for training&#13;
indigenous and non-indigenous commnunities on a wide range of topics and for participation,&#13;
dissemination and information activities for which indigenous communities would be eligible.&#13;
Project annual reviews would include assessments of progress made in the&#13;
preparation/implementation of the IPDP.&#13;

NICARAGUA&#13;
RURAL MUNICIPALITIES PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
The proposed project is essentially beneficial to the environment since its objectives&#13;
include improving the policy and institutional framework for natural resources, improving&#13;
natural resource management at the local level, reducing the pressures on the Atlantic frontier&#13;
and protecting biodiversity in the Atlantic through the associated GEF project.&#13;
Environmental risks posed by the project, although minor, are associated with some&#13;
of the sub-project categories to be financed and the decentralization process to be supported by&#13;
the project. A mitigation plan for sub-projects was included in the sub-project cycle and is&#13;
described in Annex 4 and in the Operational Manual. An important instrument for managing&#13;
environmental risks would be the Environment and Land Use Plans (ELUP) to be developed&#13;
during the project's first year both for the Pacific and the Atlantic regions. These plans would&#13;
identify areas of high environmental risks and contain other information necessary for&#13;
MARENA and the MTUs to make decisions regarding environmental aspects of subprojects.&#13;
To minimize environmental risks from decentralization, an environmental&#13;
assessment process and mitigation plan at the municipal level, detailing the procedures that&#13;
municipalities should adopt to screen out investments that pose high environmental risks or to&#13;
include mitigating measures, was developed by INIFOM as part of the preparation for the&#13;
proposed project. The procedures are described in the project's background document in the&#13;
project file: " Sistema de Procedimientos Ambientales para la Gesti6n Ambiental Municipal".&#13;
These procedures, once implemented, would apply not only to the municipalities eligible for&#13;
the project, but to all municipalities in the country.&#13;
Activities in the Atlantic pose higher environmental risks, thus they would only be&#13;
initiated once the Environment and Land Use Plan for the Atlantic, including a delineation of&#13;
the proposed Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor, is completed. Subprojects in the Atlantic would&#13;
have to be consistent with this plan and with the Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor Strategy and&#13;
would only start once the associated GEF project becomes effective.&#13;

RURAL MUNICIPALITIES PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING, AND EVALUATION&#13;
1. MONITORING&#13;
The establishment of an efficient project monitoring system is instrumental to&#13;
assure the consistency of project activities, and in particular of the investment program, with&#13;
the stated objectives. A set of monitoring indicators, based on the project's logical framework&#13;
analysis, is shown in Table A 0. 1 through AI 0.7 and Figure 10. 1. The project monitoring&#13;
system is separated in two distinct units: one dealing with the municipal development&#13;
component implemented by INIFOM; and a second one focused on natural resource&#13;
management and protection implemented by MARENA. The project monitoring system would&#13;
be based on a Management Information System (MIS) with a database which organizes&#13;
pertinent physical and financial information.&#13;
A. Municipal Development Component&#13;
This component relies heavily on a decentralized system of decision-making and&#13;
management, involving a large number of small, diverse subprojects. Hence, since the ex ante&#13;
determination of the pattern of project investment and other key parameters is not possible,&#13;
effective supervision depends on the existence of a capable monitoring system. This system&#13;
will provide information regarding the progress of the subproject in its different stages (e.g.,&#13;
subproject approval, procurement, implementation, and disbursement), types of projects&#13;
approved and implemented, and verify that project activities are consistent with the guidelines,&#13;
targeting methodology, and selection criteria included in the Operational Manual (Reglamento&#13;
Operativo). This MIS would be managed with a decentralized database to be established by&#13;
the MTU, and aggregated at the INIFOM regional and central levels. INIFOM would also&#13;
disseminate lessons learned through monitoring among municipalities and communities. For&#13;
each subproject, the MIS would record at least the following information:&#13;
(1)  a brief subproject description;&#13;
(2)  location by community and municipality;&#13;
(3)  number of beneficiaries and among them number of women and indigenous&#13;
people;&#13;
(4)  cost of the subproject and co-financing including community contribution;&#13;
(5)  date of contract signing;&#13;
(6)  starting and finishing dates for the subproject;&#13;
(7)  an index of physical work carried out at each monitoring visit and a physical&#13;
measure at completion (e.k. kms. of community road rehabilitated; wells&#13;
built, area under erosion control, etc.);&#13;
(8)  acceptance by the community of the finished subproject;&#13;
(9)  name and address of community contact person;&#13;
(10) subproject sustainability, effective use, and replicability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Project Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
Responsibilities. Responsibilities for monitoring will be shared between local and&#13;
central levels. Local monitoring would involve the community members involved in each sub-&#13;
project (Project User Group - PUG), the Community Supervision Committee (CSC), and the&#13;
Municipal Technical Unit (MTU). INIFOM's Regional Offices would assist in monitoring&#13;
some of the larger and special projects and could request assistance from specialized line&#13;
agencies such as MAG, INTA, INRA, MAG, MARENA, PNDR, INAA, FISE and MCT.&#13;
Local monitoring (supervision) of the cost and efficiency of works under implementation would&#13;
increasingly be carried out by the MTU, with support from the INIFOM Regional Offices,&#13;
which at present does the majority of this work. The central office of INIFOM would be&#13;
responsible for organizing the data in the MIS and supervising its regional offices.&#13;
Technical assistance in monitoring would be provided during the project pilot phase&#13;
(year 1). While some working experience exists in these areas, it is essential that for a period&#13;
of time the units responsible for planning, monitoring and evaluation receive assistance from a&#13;
qualified consultant, in order to assist in the design and operation the system. TORs for a&#13;
consultant to assist INIFOM and MARENA in reviewing and fine-tuning the planning and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation functions and procedures is included in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan.&#13;
B. Natural Resources and Biodiversity Components&#13;
Monitoring of activities in this component can be handled using MARENA's&#13;
existing monitoring and reporting systems, except for the Associated Atlantic Biodiversity&#13;
Corridor Project (GEF). This component would require a specific system currently being&#13;
designed.&#13;
2. REPORTING&#13;
To the extent possible, reporting procedures within each component would follow&#13;
existing institutional reporting systems, in order to avoid duplication of effort. The complete&#13;
project reporting system would produce different types of reports, depending on the user level&#13;
involved. Two different project progress reports will be submitted to IDA: one from INIFOM&#13;
on municipal development; and one from MARENA on natural resources policies and&#13;
institutions and biodiversity protection.&#13;
MTUs would issue simple monthly reports (one or two pages) to INIFOM, signed&#13;
by the mayor, listing subproject progress, work carried out, implementation difficulties and&#13;
main actions programmed for the following month. Information would flow from this level to&#13;
the Regional Delegations of INIFOM, which would issue aggregate monthly reports. These&#13;
monthly reports would be sent to the Directorate of Planning of INIFOM in Managua.&#13;
INIFOM's Directorate of Planning would be responsible for bringing together the&#13;
data from both Regional offices, and other information on the project's activities managed&#13;
centrally (training, technical assistance, etc.), to be included in the reports for the senior&#13;
management of INIFOM, CONAGRO, MIFIN and for IDA to be issued following the end of&#13;
each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31). The quarterly reports&#13;
would contain the current update of the MIS, with all data provided in a suitable magnetic&#13;
base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Project Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
The Directorate of Planning of MARENA would also issue separate quarterly&#13;
reports (March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31) listing accomplishments,&#13;
problems and next steps, for senior management of MARENA, CONAGRO, MIFIN and IDA&#13;
The general content of each of the two quarterly reports (INIFOM and MARENA)&#13;
would include:&#13;
(1)  A summary of project implementation. This section would provide an&#13;
overall assessment of project progress, indicating major advances and&#13;
problems identified, in relation to targets set out in the annual operating&#13;
plan, as well as in regards to important unplanned events. Progress&#13;
regarding problems and proposed actions to resolve them from the previous&#13;
reporting period should be included.&#13;
(2)  Local and central government activities. Given the project's focus on&#13;
developing local institutions, the reports should clearly differentiate activities&#13;
and problems at the municipal/community level, from those carried out&#13;
directly by INIFOM and MARENA.&#13;
(3)  Indicators. Reference must be made to the main monitoring indicators (see&#13;
Tables AI0. I through AI0.5). These indicators would allow report&#13;
recipients to gauge project progress in important physical aspects. Where&#13;
changes in the indicators occur from one quarter to the next, these should be&#13;
reported and conunented upon. Where no change in an indicator takes place,&#13;
this should be clearly stated. Indicators of use of funds (financial&#13;
indicators), would be provided to indicate resources provided and used by&#13;
financing source (the IDA, Government of Nicaragua, Municipalities,&#13;
beneficiary communities)&#13;
(4)  Status of legal covenants. A summary of compliance with the project's&#13;
legal covenants as established in the legal documents (loan agreement,&#13;
INIFOM agreement, municipality agreements) would be an annex to each&#13;
report.&#13;
The two reports from INIFOM and MARENA pertaining to the final quarter of&#13;
each year, would include, in addition to the above information, accumulated data on the full&#13;
year's accomplishments and other information required to provide a complete picture of&#13;
component development. Tables of indicators would be designed in order to facilitate&#13;
comparison of the current year's data with that of previous years.&#13;
3. EVALUATION&#13;
The project would develop and implement a range of evaluation studies to measure&#13;
the impact of the subproject investments and to provide appropriate feedback to improve&#13;
project methodology and implementation. INIFOM would be responsible for drafting the&#13;
Termns of References (TORs) -- in accordance with IDA -- and contracting the consulting&#13;
services for the following evaluation studies:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Project Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
( I) Annual Reviews to assist the GON and IDA in the identification of positive&#13;
experiences and implementation problems and bottlenecks, in order to&#13;
recommend modification to project methodology and procedures for&#13;
incorporation during the second half of the project implementation period.&#13;
Among the various aspects of project implementation to be reviewed, the&#13;
annual reviews would evaluate the efficiency and impact of the different&#13;
components, the effectiveness of institutional development activities, the&#13;
level of community participation, and the ability of the project to target and&#13;
reach the poor. The annual reviews would evaluate the success of&#13;
subprojects in terrns of their specific objectives, and the quality, efficiency,&#13;
and sustainability of the investments. Within a statistically significant&#13;
sample, the study would better analyze the following points: (i) beneficiary&#13;
participation in the selection process; (ii) physical design adequacy, unitary&#13;
costs, and efficiency of procurement procedures; (iii) the targeting of&#13;
subproject benefits, and (iv) evaluation of sustainability, effective use, and&#13;
replicability of the investments after their physical implementation,&#13;
particularly in terms of capacity building.&#13;
(2)   Project Impact Evaluation. The project would finance a comprehensive&#13;
evaluation, based on a statistically significant sample, to assess project&#13;
impact. The impact evaluation would be carried out by independent&#13;
consultants and contracted under TORs and procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;

RURAL MUNICIPALITIES PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
The proposed project is complex because it deals with three levels of decision-&#13;
making -- central government, municipal governments and communities -- and two managing&#13;
agencies: INIFOM and MARENA. Moreover most of the project funds will go to a large&#13;
number of small subprojects covering a variety of sectors in two different regions of the&#13;
country. Although the project preparation team put particular care in minimizing complexity,&#13;
by phasing in project activities and building into project design checks and balances to keep the&#13;
project on track, supervision needs are greater than for the typical Bank project. Furthermore&#13;
there must be opportunities, during project implementation, to revisit project design and&#13;
management and to introduce corrections if needed to enable it to meet its objectives. Hence&#13;
comprehensive Annual Reviews would take place during implementation.&#13;
Pilot Phase&#13;
The pilot phase would take place during the project's first year and would focus on&#13;
technical assistance for building capacity in INIFOM, MARENA and municipalities, project&#13;
promotion and dissemination, preparation of municipal investment plans, training of service&#13;
providers, environment and land use plans and continuation of preparation of associated GEF&#13;
project. A limited number of subprojects would be identified and prepared to test procedures.&#13;
Project launch workshops. Four project launch workshops would take place&#13;
immediately after effectiveness (month 1). All workshops would take place at approximately&#13;
the same time. The first workshop would be targeted at the management agencies - INIFOM&#13;
and MARENA -- and in addition to reviewing project objectives, implementation arrangements&#13;
and procedures, it would focus on procurement, disbursements, financial management,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. The second workshop would include, in addition to INIFOM and&#13;
MARENA, other GON agencies expected to play a role in supporting project implementation,&#13;
namely MAG, INTA, INRA, PNDR, INAA and FISE. This short workshop would review&#13;
objectives and implementation arrangements and in particular discuss the roles of those&#13;
support agencies. The third workshop would be targeted at 32 municipal governments&#13;
already selected for the project. It would focus on reviewing the procedures described in the&#13;
Operational Manual (Reglamento Interno), Subproject Cycle Training Manual and Project&#13;
Implementation Plan. The fourth workshop would be targeted at community leaders and local&#13;
NGOs and would again review the above project management documents and in particular&#13;
clearly discuss community rights and responsibilities under the project. World Bank&#13;
participation in these workshops would be:&#13;

First Phase&#13;
The first phase of the project would take place during the project's first year. At&#13;
the start of this phase INIFOM, MARENA, municipal governments and some communities&#13;
would be familiar with the project procedures and would have received training and technical&#13;
assistance in key project areas. Procedures would have been tested. The environment and land&#13;
use plans would be ready. The focus of the first phase would be on continuing with the&#13;
technical assistance programs and on initiating the subproject cycle in selected communities in&#13;
the 23 municipalities of Leon and Chinandega.&#13;

Fifth Supervision Mission. This mission (month 16) would focus on subproject&#13;
identification, implementation and management aspects and it would do several field visits to&#13;
review subproject problems. Although the composition of the mission will depend on the kinds&#13;
of subprojects being implemented tentatively the following staff should participate:&#13;
Task Manager&#13;

focused on the subproject cycle and implementation arrangements. It would consist of:&#13;
Task Manager&#13;
Natural Resources Specialist&#13;
Water Engineer&#13;
Participation Specialist&#13;
Total Bank SW -- 6 SW&#13;
Second-year Review and Eighth Supervision Mission. This would be a full&#13;
mission (month 24) to review the entire project design, implementation arrangements,&#13;
management and organization, Operational Manual, training programs, community structures,&#13;
indigenous peoples aspects, municipal capacity, financial controls, monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
environment and land use plans and legislative proposals. This mission would propose changes&#13;
to the project implementation arrangements, if necessary, to permit a smooth implementation&#13;
during the second phase. The mission would also review candidate municipalities for the&#13;
project's second phase and prepare a supervision plan for that phase. The mission would&#13;
consist of:&#13;
Task Manager&#13;
Financial Analyst&#13;
Participation Specialist&#13;
Indigenous peoples specialist&#13;
Public Finance Specialist&#13;

Total Bank Resources for Pilot and First Phase&#13;
In total 51 SW would be needed for missions during the project's first two years&#13;
and another 30 SW would be needed at headquarters. The total staff requirements for the&#13;
project's first two years would be around 81 SW. Supervision requirements would decline&#13;
during the second phase once procedures are well internalized and key obstacles to&#13;
implementation removed.&#13;

Second Phase&#13;
The second phase of the project would consist of the last three years of the project.&#13;
This would be the full-fledged implementation phase with the number of subprojects in the 23&#13;
municipalities of Leon and Chinandega quickly increasing as experience with procedures&#13;
increases. The 9 municipalities of San Carlos and RAAS would initiate subprojects in this&#13;
phase. The Associated GEF project would also start at the beginning of this phase. A&#13;
supervision plan for the second phase would be prepared during the second-year review.&#13;

econometric studies have found time and again a clear positive relation between investments in&#13;
those activities and countries' economic development (see for example recent Bank's World&#13;
Development Reports on poverty, environment, health and infrastructure). On the other hand,&#13;
ex-ante estimation of the benefits of a particular investment of that sort is fraught with&#13;
difficulties, stemming from high levels of uncertainty, lack of engineering data on relationships&#13;
between inputs and outputs, limited price information and widespread externalities. These&#13;
difficulties are compounded in the proposed project because, given its demand driven nature,&#13;
which investments will be actually implemented is unknown. Hence the purpose of this Annex&#13;
is to more specifically identify project costs and benefits and to roughly estimate, as orders of&#13;
magnitude, the economic impacts of the project from a subset of activities given assumptions&#13;
of what kinds of subprojects will be demanded and implemented.&#13;
2. ECONOMIC BENEFITS&#13;
There are three dimensions of economic impacts from the proposed project: (1)&#13;
from decentralization; (2) from natural resource and environmental policy reform; and (3)&#13;
from subprojects.&#13;
The expected economic impacts from decentralization are primarily three: (a)&#13;
reduction in costs of delivering public services relative to the costs of these services if they&#13;
were managed centrally; (b) a better optimum (more efficient mix) of local investments&#13;
relative to the mix accruing if decisions were taken by a centralized agency; and (c) improved&#13;
community structures and thus increases in the social capital.&#13;
The expected economic impacts from natural resource and environmental policy&#13;
reform are primarily three: (a) economic efficiency gains from eliminating many spurious&#13;
regulations on natural resource use; (b) reduction in the costs of governing due to increased&#13;
government credibility from actually enforcing a clearer legal and policy framework than under&#13;
the without project scenario; and (c) better intemalization of environmental extemalities by the&#13;
public, private and NGO sectors.&#13;
The expected economic impacts from subprojects are primarily four: (a) through&#13;
leaming by doing and training reduction in the costs of municipalities and communities in&#13;
identifying, preparing, implementing and operating subprojects; (b) improved decision-making&#13;
by private farmers and other rural poor from the capacity building projects; (c) economic&#13;
gains from enhanced environmental protection; and (d) economic surpluses from economic&#13;

infrastructure and higher productivity from on-farm and off-farrn economic subsistence&#13;
activities to be supported by the project.&#13;
B. SUBPROJECTS&#13;
Methodology Used. During preparation economic analysis focused only on a&#13;
subset of those benefits: the economic impacts of the expected portfolio of environmental and&#13;
productive subprojects. The rationale was that if this subset of benefits is sufficient to cover&#13;
all economic project costs, the project makes economic sense and it is not necessary to estimate&#13;
the other, more difficult to quantify benefits. Because sub-projects are demand driven and it is&#13;
not known ex-ante what community and municipality choices will be, two estimates of sub-&#13;
project demand were developed by polling municipal governments, NGOs and beneficiaries&#13;
directly (see Annexes 1 and 3).&#13;
Therefore, the present estimates should be regarded as an exercise, aiming only at&#13;
giving an order of magnitude of the project's potential benefits. The exercise looks only to the&#13;
more productive related components (environmental protection, rural infrastructure, and rural&#13;
production) which together account for some 50% of expected total project costs. No benefit&#13;
estimates are attempted for the other 50% of the project which would cover institutional&#13;
strengthening activities and capacity building at the national and local level. Within each&#13;
category a short list of possible subprojects was used to illustrate the potential economic&#13;
benefits and the environmental and poverty alleviation achievements of the environmental&#13;
protection, rural infrastructure and rural production components. The following types of&#13;
subprojects were evaluated: (1) erosion control; (2) mangrove protection; (3) rural water; (4)&#13;
rehabilitation of municipal and community roads; and (5) subsistence agriculture/livestock&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
Environmental Subprojects&#13;
Erosion Control. Although soil erosion is to a large extent a natural process, its&#13;
acceleration due to deforestation, agricultural practices, and other rural development activities&#13;
(see Annex 2), can have detrimental consequences both at the farm level (reduced crop yields)&#13;
and off-site (flooding, biodiversity losses, damage to infrastructure). Although this analysis&#13;
focuses only on on-farm soil erosion impacts there is substantial anecdotal evidence that in the&#13;
Pacific Region of Nicaragua off-site impacts of soil erosion are even more important, in&#13;
particular through the damage to infrastructure (roads and irrigation systems) and respiratory&#13;
disease due to volcanic dust from wind erosion.&#13;
Agriculturally induced soil erosion and resulting crop losses have surfaced as major&#13;
concerns in all the surveys carried out during project preparation. Available figures seem to&#13;
confirm this concern. Soils in the project region are to a large extent young soils from volcanic&#13;
origin, hence prone to erosion, particularly wind erosion, as a result of the region's&#13;
predominant semiarid climate, with a long dry season. According to De Franco, et al (1993)1&#13;
soil losses in Leon and Chinandega agricultural areas range from a low 35 - 45 ton/ha/year, for&#13;
permanent or semi-permanent crops, like rice or sugar, to 100 ton/halyear or more, in soils&#13;

devoted to annual crops such as beans, corn, sesame and cotton. Soil losses in recently&#13;
deforested areas are higher.&#13;
De Franco, et al (1993) provide detailed erosion figures and associated yield declines&#13;
for six Nicaraguan regions, and eight different crops, from 1981 to 1991. Together with&#13;
production and yields figures (from Nicaragua's MAG) they were used to calculate:&#13;
(1) An average production value of US$179 per hectare/year. This is a weighted&#13;
average based on production and yield figures for the six most important regional&#13;
crops during 1993/94, valued at 1994 fann gate prices.2&#13;
(2) An average erosion induced yield loss of 1.5 % per hectare/year. This is also a&#13;
weighted average, based on 1981 - 1991 erosion figures, and 1993/94 production&#13;
figures.&#13;
Considering that the regional harvested area in 1993/94 was approximately 200,000&#13;
ha, the estimates from (1) and (2) can be used to roughly calculate annual erosion related&#13;
losses, and their present value over a multi-year period.&#13;
The potential on-farm gains of soil erosion control are significant. Arresting soil&#13;
erosion in the area currently under cultivation, over the next 20 years, would result in increased&#13;
crops with a present value of US$ 52 million dollars, or US$ 23 per ha (at a 10% discount&#13;
rate)3.&#13;
According to estimations developed during project preparation, conservation costs&#13;
could range from a low of US$ 81 dollars/ha (mostly cultivation and cropping changes, and the&#13;
use of vegetation barriers) to a high of US$ 405 dollars/ha. Estimated on-farm benefits rule out&#13;
the more expensive conservation methods. On the other hand, if an average cost figure of&#13;
US$137 is used, 75% (US$4.3 million) of the project's environmental protection component&#13;
would be enough to finance the protection of 27,400 ha, approximately 14% of the current&#13;
crop area. This would entail benefits of the order of US$ 8.6 million, and a benefit-cost ratio of&#13;
2.0. Benefits would be significantly higher if future increases in rural production (the&#13;
assumption is that production would continue at current levels except for gains from erosion&#13;
controls) or off-farm benefits had been considered as well.&#13;
These figures are only illustrative. A recent study conducted in Central America&#13;
(Lutz, et al, 1994) suggests that, in many instances, this is not the case even when erosion&#13;
control investments are provided at no cost. In Nicaragua, terraces were built on farns in the&#13;
Lake Xolotan watershed, at no cost to the farmers, with the purpose of reducing flood hazards&#13;
in Managua city. But since terraces interfered with cultivation practices, and did not result in&#13;
perceived benefits to the farmer, they were soon destroyed. Given the demand driven nature of&#13;
this project these problems would be avoided.&#13;

Mangrove Protection. The larger portion of Nicaragua's mangrove is in the project's&#13;
region, mostly in the Chinandega department. Although nearly 80% of the regions 84,700&#13;
hectare of mangrove have been declared protected area, they are actually highly intervened by&#13;
small farmers and fishermen's activities (extraction of firewood, poles, shellfishes, shrimp&#13;
larvae, and mangroves' bark), and the deforestation of large tracts of mangroves to install&#13;
shrimp ponds, of which 7,000 hectares have already been granted, and authorization is pending&#13;
for another 10,000 hectares.4&#13;
If the process of mangrove deterioration is not arrested, it will soon reduce the&#13;
productivity of the very same activities that now breed on it, a process already at work in&#13;
nearby countries such as Ecuador and Honduras. Unfortunately there is no comprehensive&#13;
study on the economic value of Nicaragua's mangroves, which could guide the design of&#13;
technical alternatives and the estimation of benefits.' In the meantime, available local and&#13;
intemational experiences provide some evidence of what such benefits might be:&#13;
(1) Families living from small-scale extractive activities in Chinandega's mangroves&#13;
report an annual income ranging from US$ 1,000 to US$ 2,000 net of production&#13;
costs, based on a harvesting area of approximately 10 ha. per family (an annual&#13;
economic value per mangrove ha/year of US$ 100 - 200 dollars).&#13;
(2) Due to the incipient shrimp pond production, larvae collection has been modest,&#13;
averaging some US$ 33,000 dollars a year, but if the full potential 30,000 ha. of&#13;
ponds were in place they could represent a market for shrimp larvae of some US$&#13;
4 million dollars a year, or US$ 133 per mangrove ha/year. Since current prices&#13;
paid for wild larvae --US$ 2.5 per thousand are half the cost of laboratory&#13;
produced larvae, this figure could be considered representative of the net benefits&#13;
provided by the ecosystem supply of wild larvae. Unfortunately there is no&#13;
indication to assess if this would be a sustainable larvae's capture level.&#13;
(3) The 1993 harvest of shrimp off Nicaragua's Pacific coast amounted to 715,500&#13;
kgs, 90% of which was exported at an average price of US$ 1.2 per kg. It seems&#13;
that current capture is well below its sustainable level, considering that studies of&#13;
shrimp productivity in coastal Asian waters off mangrove areas suggest that 1&#13;
hectare of mangrove can be the early breading ground of as much as 862 kgs of&#13;
adult see shrimps (with a corresponding gross value of US$ 4,950 dollar). It&#13;
should be noticed, though, that early larvae capture would reduce this productivity&#13;
figures and, furthermore the region's mangrove are already highly deteriorated.&#13;
Also it is not clear that the Asia figures can be extrapolated to the Nicaragua case.&#13;
(4) Studies of several Caribbean areas have estimated net harvest values ranging from&#13;
a low US$ 50 dollars/halyear where only traditional extractive activities take&#13;
4      Although several references mentioned 7,000 ha of existing ponds, those in production seem&#13;
to be only a fraction --around 250 ha. to 300 ha.-- considering 1993 figures for shrimp production --&#13;
138,198 kgs - and average yields of 545 kgs/hectare.&#13;
5      In 1995 two small projects with international support began working on sustainable&#13;
development projects in region's mangrove areas.&#13;

place, up to a high US$ 1,550 dollars/ha/year where intensive shrimp ponds are in&#13;
place (Hamilton/Snedaker, 1984).6&#13;
Considering the high range of extractive activities reported in the region's mangroves -&#13;
-US$ 200 per ha/year of net benefits-- the net present value of an hectare of mangrove over a&#13;
20 year period, would be around US$ 1,700-1,900. With a conservative mangroves'&#13;
deforestation figure of 3.5% per year, the present value of potential losses of mangrove&#13;
deforestation over a 20 years period would represent about US$33.8 million. It should be&#13;
remembered that these are "potential" net benefits, that only would accrue if and when the&#13;
mangrove is harvested on a sustainable base.&#13;
Costs of conservation cum sustainable production projects in mangrove areas varies&#13;
widely, with some estimates developed during project preparation as low as US$ 70/hectare&#13;
and two current projects in the area featuring costs around US$ 500/hectare. Allocating 25%&#13;
of the project's environmental component (US$1.5 million) to mangrove protection could result&#13;
in the conservation of some 3,000 hectare of mangrove, with a present value of potential&#13;
benefits of about US$ 3.6 million and a benefit cost ratio of 2.4.&#13;
Municipal and Community Infrastructure Subprojects.&#13;
Both provision of drinking water and roads improvernent have been singled out as the&#13;
most important infrastructure developments to ameliorate the plight of rural poor in Nicaragua&#13;
(World Bank, 1995). Therefore they are used below as examples of the activities that could be&#13;
funded by the project's infrastructure subprojects (US$ 7.4 million).&#13;
Rural water supply. According to end of 1993 figures, over 70% of Nicaragua's&#13;
rural poor lacked access to piped water, inside or outside their houses, or access to a public&#13;
standpipe. Almost all rural poor lacked any sewer system and over 156,000 rural poor (some&#13;
27,000 families) lacked a water connection or access to a public standpipe. The high social and&#13;
economic costs of this situation have been repeatedly highlighted:&#13;
"...children in households without water and sanitation are twice more likely to be&#13;
malnourished than children in households with water and sanitation.. Low coverage&#13;
of water and sanitation services.. explain why diarrhea and vector borne diseases are&#13;
still the main causes of morbidity and mortality in Nicaragua" (World Bank, 1995,&#13;
p.ii).&#13;
Poor people in rural areas pay for trucks delivered water more then ten times the urban&#13;
water rates: US$ 2 to US$ 3.3 per cubic meter, compared to an average of US$ 0.16 per cubic&#13;
meter paid in urban areas. Considering that, on average, poor rural dwellers without water&#13;
services use one hour a day for water collection, each family is investing the equivalent of US$&#13;
110 per year to obtain a very limited supply of poor quality water (this figure is based on a&#13;
salary of US$ 0.30 per hour, that is the lower end of hourly earnings of poor rural females).&#13;
Considering an opportunity cost correction factor for rural labor in Nicaragua of 0.6, the&#13;
economic cost of water collection at present per family-year would be US$ 66.&#13;

Costs of rural water provision vary with the characteristics of the site and the&#13;
pretended level of service. Cost of house connection to piped systems (gravity or power&#13;
pumped water systems) ranges from US$ 45 to US$ 100 per person. Providing individual or&#13;
communal manual pumps is much cheaper, with per capita costs in the range of US$ 10 to&#13;
US$ 30. Using US$ 50 as an intermediate value (US$ 290 per family), providing water to all&#13;
the non-served rural poor in Leon and Chinandega, would cost US$ 7.8 million. Assuming&#13;
that US$ 5.9 million would be spent in community rural water projects, the present value of&#13;
costs including 5% per year of operation and maintenance would add up to US$ 8.2 million,&#13;
compared with US$ 11.0 million of family savings. The benefit cost ratio would be 1.3.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Rural Municipal and Community Roads. Between 1980 and 1991&#13;
Nicaragua lost 3,500 km of rural roads, almost 20% of its 1980 road system. Bad rural roads&#13;
have been blamed for agricultural production losses, high transport costs, and hence high&#13;
spreads between market prices and farmn prices (see World Bank, 1995, vol 1). During 1994,&#13;
wholesale prices were 39% higher than farm-gate prices, for a weighted average of the six&#13;
more important regional crops.&#13;
Le6n and Chinandega have 2,500 Km of roads, of which 950 are rural roads, suitable&#13;
for dry season use only. The costs of upgrading community and municipality roads to an&#13;
around-the-year use standard range between US$ 800 to US$ 1,500 per km. To revamp the&#13;
thousand kilometers of existing rural roads and assuming the higher figure cost, would cost&#13;
about US$ 1.5 million (some 20% of the project's rural infrastructure component).&#13;
If better roads could reduce the spread between farm gate and wholesale prices by 5%&#13;
(from 39% to 37%), that would represent an extra income to local farmers in the order of US$&#13;
2.9 dollars/mz/year, as much as US$ 0.8 million per year considering the current harvested&#13;
area.7 Over 20 years, and considering the higher investment cost (US$ 1,500 per km) plus 5%&#13;
annual maintenance cost, the present value of total cost would amount to US$ 2.1 million,&#13;
compared to the present value of benefits of US$ 6.7 million and a benefit-cost ratio of 3.2&#13;
Increases in farm-gate prices are not the only result from better rural roads. According&#13;
to the World Bank poverty report, poor rural roads, together with lack of storage and treatment&#13;
facilities, contributed to the loss of as much as 20% of the corn and 8% of the beans harvested&#13;
in Nicaragua (World Bank, 1995 vol I p.42). Better rural roads would result in an increase in&#13;
production and a decrease in crop losses. Hence the figures quoted are a low estimate of the&#13;
benefits accruing from better rural roads.&#13;
Community Productive Subprojects&#13;
Each category of municipal investments would have, directly or indirectly, a positive&#13;
impact on rural production. The category of municipal subprojects specifically aims at&#13;
increasing rural production from poor farmers. In total about US$7.4 million of community&#13;
productive investments could be financed through the project. Their financial and economic&#13;
costs and benefits are addressed in this section.&#13;
' Based in a Co. 1465,20 per hectare average value for the 1993/94 harvest of 274,000 manzanas.&#13;
Although only a portion of the regional crop is produced in areas with poor roads, the total crop area&#13;
is used in this estimation since the 39% price spread is an overall average.&#13;

To evaluate the economic returns to subprojects included in this category eleven&#13;
expected crop or activity budgets and three farm models were assessed. These budgets and&#13;
farm models compare the with and without project situation and forecast improvements upon&#13;
current production practice that would result in a 20% to 33% increase in crop yields,&#13;
according to the selected crop or activity. The yield increases would come about through soil&#13;
conservation measures and new inputs, specially better seeds. Summary information on crops,&#13;
family income per cropped area, and expected outputs are provided in Tables A 12.1 and&#13;

For the purpose of the financial and economic analysis, several representative farm&#13;
models where developed in order to show what would happen without the project and what&#13;
would occur with the proposed project. The models indicate present and projected values for&#13;
the main variables (investments, labor use, operating costs, production and gross and net&#13;
family revenues) considering market prices the financial analysis and economic (or shadow)&#13;
prices for the estimation of the overall impact of the project. For the latter, a standard&#13;
conversion factor of 0.85 was considered and a cost of labor conversion factor of 0.60 was&#13;
used in order to obtain an approximation of the opportunity cost of family labor. The seven&#13;
farm models represent a variety of farming systems expected to be chosen/promoted and the&#13;
expected changes in cropping patterns/family incomes. Table A. 12.2 summarizes the with&#13;

The summary results of the economic retums from the adoption of those farm models&#13;
is presented in Table A12.3. All models are financially profitable suggesting that beneficiaries&#13;
are likely to be interested in the adoption of the conservation measures and changes in cropping&#13;
patterns sampled. However in the case of smaller-income farms, although financially profitable&#13;
(positive NPV and attractive IRR), a decline in family income in the first years may prevent&#13;
households from adopting the conservation measures and agroforestry systems analyzed. In&#13;
such cases it is justified, given the project's poverty objective, that financial incentives be&#13;
offered through the project in order to facilitate the adoption of the new patterns provided that&#13;
the soil improvement interventions and positive environmental effects are achieved.&#13;

To estimate the economic impact of the productive projects' subcomponent, with and&#13;
without project scenarios were considered, assuming that 10,000 small farmers (households)&#13;
would be benefited.&#13;
3.     POVERTY ALLEVIATION&#13;
The project focus is on environmental protection and poverty alleviation. References&#13;
have already been made to both issues in relation to the environmental protection and to the&#13;
rural water components. Some further comments on the extent and composition of poverty, and&#13;
on the potential poverty alleviation impact of financing rural production follow.&#13;
According to the World Bank 1995 study, Nicaragua's poverty line as of November&#13;
1993 was Co 214.47 of per capita monthly income (with an extreme poverty line at Co. 101.32&#13;
of per capita monthly income). Since the average rural family size is 5.8 persons per&#13;
household, the rural family income poverty line, adjusted to 1995 prices would be al Co.&#13;
18,700 family/year or US$ 2,487 /family/year.8&#13;
As of the end of 1993, Nicaragua had a total population of 4 million people. Le6n and&#13;
Chinandega accounted for 702,000 people of which 312,000 people lived in rural areas. At&#13;
that time, more than half Nicaragua's population was under the poverty line, and almost 20%&#13;
of the population was in extreme poverty. Country-wide, poverty is concentrated in rural&#13;
areas. This pattern is even more marked in Ledn and Chinandega (see Table A 12.4)&#13;
8      The poverty line is defined as the total per capita monthly expenditure at which an&#13;
individual obtains the minimum daily caloric requirements. The extreme poverty line is defined as the&#13;
level of per capita monthly food expenditures required to obtain the daily minimum caloric&#13;
requirement (World Bank, 1995, vo. I p.2). Hereafter figures for poor population are inclusive of&#13;
extremely poor population.&#13;

Total Number of Farms                           64.705 (100%)&#13;
As much as 83% of the rural poor male population is engaged in agriculture, in most&#13;
cases both as peasants and occasional wage earners. Although the majority of Nicaragua's&#13;
rural poor households are peasants, only half their income comes from farming and related&#13;
activities9 with another third coming from wages.&#13;
The US$ 6.7 million that according to demand estimates are expected to be channeled&#13;
to community productive subprojects could benefit between 1,450 and 10,000 such families. If&#13;
the higher figure were achieved it would signify benefiting 25% of the region's poor farmers.&#13;
Comparatively, in 1993 only 720 poor farmers in the region received some kind of assistance&#13;
(averaging $ 560 dollars).&#13;
Reaching 25% of the region poor farmers is probably difficult. According to some&#13;
estimates, for a farm to produce an annual income of US$ 2,500 dollars/year, it should have&#13;
between 4 and 14 ha in production (depending on the crop mix). But the majority of poor&#13;
farmers have holdings of less than 3 hectares. Significant increases in small farm sizes would&#13;
be called for in order to achieve above poverty incomes, based solely in the farm production.&#13;
On the other hand, farming is currently a marginal source of income for a considerable number&#13;
of poor peasants. Thus the project includes in the category of community productive&#13;
subprojects non-farm investments, such as microenterprises and small processing facilities,&#13;
which would be a way to complement, or in some cases substitute for, farn income, in order to&#13;
help a larger number of rural poor rise above poverty incomes.&#13;
4.     SUMMARY OF BENEFITS&#13;
Tables A12.5 through A12.7 give a summarv presentation of the findings in terms of&#13;
economic benefits, environmental improvements, and poverty alleviation. The proposed project&#13;
is expected to have a positive impact on the country's economy and on the sustainability of its&#13;
natural resources. The NPV of the incremental benefits, net of project costs was estimated at&#13;
9      These figures add up self-employment, imputed rent, and own production (World Bank,&#13;
1995 Vol 11 p.64)&#13;
&#13;

US$2.3 million and the Benefit/Cost Ratio at a 10% discount rate was 1.04. As for&#13;
uncertainties and the risks of failing to attain the proposed targets, rural infrastructure&#13;
development presents the lowest risks. While there is a large experience in rural projects, in&#13;
most cases rural development fails to attain the project's design figures. The environmental&#13;
component entails the highest risks due to Nicaragua's limited experiences with this type of&#13;
activities.&#13;

            Nicaragua - Rural Municipalities Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Rural
            Municipalities Project are to reduce rural poverty and to
            improve natural resources management. These objectives can
            be narrowed down more specifically to the following: 1) to
            establish a mechanism based on municipal governments and
            community organizations for reducing rural poverty through
            rural investment in economic infrastructure, improved
            natural resource management and small-scale communal
            productive activities; 2) to ensure that central government
            institutions acquire the capacity to provide a coherent
            overall framework for natural resource policy making and
            enforcement, accounting for global, national and regional
            environmental priorities; and 3) to promote the long-term
            integrity of a biological corridor along the Atlantic slope
            of Nicaragua, conserving key global biodiversity values. To
            meet these objectives, the project will have the following
            three components: 1) rural municipalities development,
            including institutional development, information,
            participation, training and grants; 2) natural resources
            policies and institutions involving institutional
            development and an inter-institutional technical assistance
            program; and 3) Atlantic biodiversity corridor (GEF), which
            will include land use and biodiversity planning, monitoring
            and evaluation and a financial mechanism to promote the
            sustainability of the corridor.
