&#13;
                             Robert W. Oliver                                  whole London capital market.    That was changed, and any management of&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               the Bank would, I think, have recognized that change.    This was not&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Harold, may I begin our second conversation by simply asking:       something that just sprang out of the bead of George Woods or anyone&#13;
&#13;
''What, in your view, were the major accomplishments of the Woods              else.     It was a major fact which the Bank bad to do something about.&#13;
&#13;
Years?"    What were some of the things that Hr. Woods and his associates      Having said that, I think we can observe that the accomplishments of&#13;
&#13;
sought to have the Bank achieve in those years?                                the Woods presidency were very considerable indeed.&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:    Well, I think it is useful to recall that not only was the                  He broadened the lending operations of the Bank very considerably&#13;
&#13;
management of the Bank changed at this time, but also the clientele of         to meet the needs of this new clientele.     In his very first&#13;
&#13;
the Bank was being substantially changed.       It has been said a good many   presidential address, he spoke of the need to do this to meet the needs&#13;
&#13;
times, and Woods himself said it, that Woods changed the Bank into a           of these new developing countries with a wider variety of loans and&#13;
&#13;
Development Institution.    I think that is only partly true.     I don't      with more loans of particular types.     He spoke among other things of&#13;
&#13;
think that you can say that the Bank was not a Development Institution         more agricultural loans.     And just to prove how fickle this kind of&#13;
&#13;
under Black.    It committed very large sums of sums of money in India,        analysis is, I think you might look at the figures, and, as you do, I&#13;
&#13;
for example.    It established the Economic Development Institute, for         think you will see something like three or four years before the Woods&#13;
&#13;
example.    It established the International Development Association.          Bank got up to the level of the agricultural lending that had been&#13;
&#13;
All those things were hall marks of something that was really a                achieved as a Black Bank.     So some of this is rhetoric, useful rhetoric&#13;
&#13;
Development Institution.                                                       and not insincere rhetoric, but it doesn't always directly reflect the&#13;
&#13;
    Woods certainly carried on that movement, but what I wanted to             facts.     Anyway 1 was saying that Woods greatly broadened the lending&#13;
&#13;
establish here was that the clientele of the       Bank was greatly modified   spectrum of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
by the assumption of independence by about 35 African states, which            OLIVER: Can I interrupt and ask two questions about what you said;         we&#13;
&#13;
previously bad been able to reach the resources of the Bank only               were talking about adding the independent African countries.         Does this&#13;
&#13;
throul!,b the metropolitan powers who were able to guarantee loans to          imply that there was a shift in Bank lending away from its previous&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                3                                                                              4&#13;

clients and toward its new African clients1 or were the African clients      want to keep on making the point that this was not solely the creation&#13;
&#13;
served by an expansion in total Bank lending?                                of the people who were running the Bank. it was also very much the&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:    I think they were served by an expansion of total bank            consequence of the kind of situation that was facing the Bank and its&#13;
&#13;
lending.   The Bank was not unaware that this was going to happen.    You    members.&#13;
&#13;
remember that Leonard Rist left his directorship of the Economics            OLIVER:    Were there discussions about local-currency financing?        I&#13;
&#13;
Department under Black and became the Bank's special representative in       would have thought that some of these smaller. internal. agriculture&#13;
&#13;
Africa for the purpose of getting ready for this development.                projects of these countries might have been handled by a simple local&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    In the case of the agricultural loans, was there a shift in       currency loan rather than World Bank foreign currency loans.&#13;
&#13;
the kind of agriculture loans which were being made between the later        GRAVES:    Well. you mean loans that could be used for local purchases?&#13;
&#13;
Black years and.                                                             OLIVER:    Yes&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:    I think there was.   But again this was not something             GRAVES:    Well. yes. this happened.     In fact. all this was studied and&#13;
&#13;
altogether decreed in the offices of the Bank.     You know the Bank does    foreseen really as early as the Fifth Annual Report which has a very&#13;
&#13;
deal with the real world, and it deals with real clients who come to it      interesting discussion of this whole question of local currency&#13;
&#13;
with real projects.    The shift that took place. if there was one -- I      financing and sets out what was understood to be the policy of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
think you have to look at this very carefully. was somewhat away from        in local currency financing. namely that the Bank normally would not&#13;
&#13;
the big irrigation projects (although immediately I can think of big         finance local currency expenditures unless this was the       best and&#13;
&#13;
irrigation projects that continued to be made in the Woods                   virtually the only way that the Bank could reach a problem of&#13;
&#13;
administration) and somewhat more in the direction of loans for              particular importance to the development of one of its member&#13;
&#13;
internal programs of farm credit and farm equipment.     I think you would   countries.       This was the tribute that the Bank paid to the language in&#13;
have to look at the figures very carefully.     But the point is. I think.   its Articles of Agreement which spoke of "exceptional circumstances"         e~&#13;
&#13;
that there was more of a demand for this second type of loan as time         being the justification for local currency financing.&#13;
&#13;
went on; it didn 1 t necessarily mean that there was less demand for the     Local currency financing had to some extent begun in the Black&#13;
&#13;
big projects. the kinds of things the Bank continued to do     with the      administration.       It was certainly accepted by the time of _the Woods&#13;
&#13;
irrigation loan in the Sudan. for example. the second irrigation loan        administration and bad become a normal way for the Bank to operate.&#13;
&#13;
in the Sudan. which incidentally checked out to be a bust anyway.     I      whereas in Blackâ&#128;¢s time. it certainly bad been an exceptional way for&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      5                                                                             6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Bank to operate.    At any rate. the point was that. under Woods.               the International Finance Corporation.    The first president of the&#13;
&#13;
the lending operations of the Bank broadened.        The   si~e   of the staff in   International Finance Corporation had been Robert Garner.    This was&#13;
&#13;
the Bank doubled in Woods' time.                                                    almost a gift to Bob Garner to get him out of the Bank. I don't know if&#13;
&#13;
     The Bank may have been the only institution in Washington. D. C.               you have happened onto this topic before. but this was kind of a&#13;
&#13;
which was actually     reduced in size for a time.     In about 1949. I             general judgment. Garner was so conservative that if the Bank was going&#13;
&#13;
believe. the size of the Bank was actually reduced in staff.              At that   to warm up to its tasks as time went on. Garner was going to be more&#13;
&#13;
time the Bank was not a very big institution.        In 1950. the total             and more of a handicap.     I'm sure that was part of Black's thinking&#13;
&#13;
staff. professional and non professional. was about 500.            The previous    when he made Garner the president -- that and the fact that Bob Garner&#13;
&#13;
year. if my memory serves me. it was 450. and that figure was down from             wanted to run the Corporation. was very happy to become the President&#13;
&#13;
500 in about 1948.     But. at any rate. the size of the Bank was doubled           of the Corporation.     But Garner's approach to the Corporation. like his&#13;
&#13;
in the Woods Administration,                                                        approach to the Bank. was pretty conservative.&#13;
&#13;
     It was increased particularly by the addition of economists to the                 Well. Woods changed that.     He found a way to increase the size of&#13;
&#13;
staff.   One thing which Woods felt about a stronger Bank presence and              the Corporation which made it possible for the Corporation to adopt&#13;
&#13;
action in the U. N. system was that it would have to be better                      somewhat different operating policies. to become more active than it&#13;
&#13;
recognized as a center of thought about development problems. and one               had been.     The method. as you remember. was for the Corporation to&#13;
&#13;
way Woods felt it would become recognized as a center of thought would              borrow money from the World Bank for use in the Corporation's&#13;
&#13;
be if you did more and better economic work.     If you look at the Annual          operations.    The Corporation had started on a very small scale. $100&#13;
&#13;
Reports of the Bank. you would see that the character of the Reports                million or so.     and this device enabled the Corporation immediately to&#13;
&#13;
developed.   It had been a pretty brass tacks. nuts and bolts report on             double. to triple. to quadruple the size of its resources.&#13;
&#13;
what the Bank was doing preceded by a general essay on some of the                      Another problem. which is not very germane to your question but&#13;
&#13;
problems facing the Bank.     If you looked at the Annual Report as it was          I'll go on to anyway since it's part of the general picture:        the&#13;

the Corporation thereafter.     The President of the Bank was always the     Bank. because there was great opposition to this idea of a series of&#13;

other agencies associated with the United Nations: the FAO. UNESCO.          best administrators that I ever had any contact with simply because he&#13;

presidents in a way that I think many of his staff felt was very              Budgeting work at that time1&#13;
&#13;
rational and very beneficial.      This was the kind of interest that Black   GRAVES:     The man singled out to inaugurate this system was John&#13;

had not shown. and in fact. as you remember. Black had not really been        Williams which â&#128;¢â&#128;¢         John was a very able fells.   He was one of the&#13;

terribly interested in the Bank during the last two years of his term.        best minds in the Bank.     I. for one. wasn't acquainted with anything in&#13;

But Woods was interested in the organization of the Bank and the way          John's experience which suited him for this work. but I didn't doubt&#13;

the parts were put together and the way they moved and thought.               that he was a very good man and might make something of this.        One&#13;

A particular aspect of this interest which came to be very important in       thing he did which was obviously very common sensical and seemed to us&#13;

the Bank's operations. of course. was the establishment of what became        a brilliant thought. once it bad seen the light of day. was that the&#13;
&#13;
known as the Program and Budgeting Department. which got to be very           Bank instead of allocating the costs of IDA administration to this&#13;
&#13;
important in the Bank. and this is something that Woods brought in from       department and that department. this operation end that operation. would&#13;

80mewhere. I don't know where.       It was a pretty new idea in the Bank.    simply make this a single line item in its budget.      Now that was very&#13;
&#13;
The Bank had a    m~rvelous   budgeting procedure in the beginning. which     sensible.     Anyway I am saying that because this was another evidence&#13;
&#13;
wdfi   that the Controller of the Bank went around and interviewed the        that Woods was interested in administration.&#13;

&#13;
      To go on with some other thinss that Woods was responsible for, he                  lunch with Senator Taft at one point when there was some problem that&#13;
&#13;
opened the Pandora's box of interpretation and translation in the Bank                    he solved. and Taft told Gene "You know. I think you are doing a&#13;
&#13;
as part of his objective to make the Bank serve its member countries                      wonderful job there at the World Banko I just happen to think it is the&#13;
&#13;
better. But it was under WoodS that the Bank began departing from the                     wrong job."     But even Taft thought that Black was a great guy and doing&#13;

concept that English was the working language of the Bank, and if you                     well.&#13;

&#13;
business with the Bank.            We started to get into the interpreting and            and had very much less clout with the U. S. Government and was&#13;
&#13;
translation business under Woods to the extent of having simultaneous                     operating at a tiae when the U. S. Government had very much less&#13;

      'l'bose were the accomplishments of Woods, at least as I see them.                  of support to IDA and to the Bank which Woods and everyone in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
He also suffered some slings and arrows which had not been suffered by                    wanted.&#13;
&#13;
his predecessors. chiefly because of IDA. partly because of other                         OLIVER:     May I ask you about the source of the clout?   On the face of&#13;

circumstances.                                                                            it. one might have thought that the person with as a high a standing in&#13;

both very important in the Bank's scheme of things:                  Russell as a         GRAVES:     Back away a little bit and ask yourself which is the more&#13;
&#13;
leader of his party in the Senate. and George as the Chairman of the                      important and prestigious institution in American life. the Chase Bank&#13;
&#13;
Finance Committee.             It probably didn't hurt any that William                   or the First Boston Corporation?     Gene was a senior Vice President of&#13;

&#13;
GRAVES:     I don't say that everybody loves the Chase Bank.      Not only          may remember, make it clear that the channels of communication between&#13;
&#13;
that. but Gene was a member of the in-group at Chase.         It was Winthrop       the Bank and the United States Government, in this case, is the&#13;
&#13;
Aldrich who suggested that Gene go down to Washington and become an                 Executive Director.    That's the channel.   And the Bank was much more&#13;
&#13;
Executive Director of the World Bank. so that Gene was there with ell               conscious of that in the beginning than it became later on.    The&#13;
&#13;
the prestige of Salmon P. Chase and all of his descendants.         Woods was       problem was that the Executive Director of the Bank in the first days&#13;
&#13;
there with all the prestige of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and all of its                had a lot of other things to do. and the job of liaison with Congress.&#13;
descendants.                                                                        to the extent that anybody did it. fell to the lot of the Alternate&#13;
        No. this is an important thing about Black.      He was -- this is a        Executive Director who. in Black's time. was a fells named Wheeler.&#13;
dreadful thing to say in a democratic day and age           he was an               John Wheeler.    (I may be getting that name wrong.)   He was a very nice&#13;
aristocrat.        Woods recognized this.   He once said when in the little         man. but not of the kind that could do very much about the&#13;
intimate kind of meetings that used to go on before,               As he was        Congressional side in anything more than a routine way.&#13;
&#13;
on the verge of being appointed to the Bank. he once said.        Â·~ell.   you           There was also the problem that if the Executive Director of the&#13;
&#13;
know. the President of the Bank {meaning Gene Black] is a gentleman                 Bank was also an official at the U. S. Treasury. which was not always&#13;
&#13;
which is more than I can say."         Now. if Woods actually said that â&#128;¢â&#128;¢          the case but was often the case. and the Treasury had other fish to fry&#13;
&#13;
At any rate. I was talking about government and its problems.            I really   in Congress.    larger and much more important fish than all the policies&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:     No. this is an important aside.                                         something for the Treasury and doing something for the Bank. using the&#13;

&#13;
make any apologies for this.                                                        doubt that the priority was going to go to the first degree interest of&#13;

to be    respec~ed    for that fact.   Was there any discussion in the Bank of           This was a problem that was pretty clear to everybody.    It wasn't&#13;

very clear what to do about it until finally the Bank did. as you know.     the positive attention of the Bank, but be was prepared to give it his&#13;
&#13;
begin to appoint staff who worked particularly on this problem.       Not   own positive attention which was pretty effective.   The only time that&#13;
&#13;
the first. but almost the first. was John Merriam. who had been the         I remember a serious block in Congress to anything the Bank was&#13;
&#13;
assistant of an officer to Republican Senator Koebel of California.         interested in was the case of the High Dam.   As you remember, it was&#13;
He came in with a specific assignment of trying to do something about       going to be financed jointly by the governments of Britain and the&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's relations with Congress.                                         United States and the World Bank. Well, there was a lot of opposition&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   About what year was that?                                         building up in the Congress to financing the dam for various reasons,&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:   This must have been in about 1968 or '69. I would guess.          but one of the them was that it was alleged that the water from the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   It was after Woods?                                               High Dam was going to grow a lot of cotton, and Senator George, who had&#13;

GRAVES:   It was after I left the Office of Information. which was the      been an ally of Black and the Bank, obviously didn't thrill very much&#13;
&#13;
end of '67. It was right at the end of the Woods era.                       to the idea of more cotton coming out of Egypt.    But, by and large, the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Are there some records of a former Congressman named              staffing up at the Bank didn't happen in Black's time.    As we discuss&#13;
Robertson. I think. being added to the Bank's staff?     Senator            it now, it appears to have happened at the end of Woods' term.&#13;
Robertson.                                                                  OLIVER:   Do you know if George Woods himself sought to speak to people&#13;
GRAVES:   Senator Robertson of Virginia, who may be better remembered to    in Congress and do the same thing in his administration that Eugene&#13;
posterity as the father of Pat Robertson, founder of the Baptist            Black had done successfully in his?&#13;
&#13;
College down in Norfolk and the head of the 700 club.    That's right,      GRAVES:   I'm sure he aust have, but I don't know of my own knowledge&#13;
&#13;
you're quite right.   Senator Robertson was brought into the Bank, was      of specific instances where this occurred. There was a lot of&#13;
&#13;
given an office in Demuth's shop.     But that would have been about 1967   travelling back and forth between the Bank and the Treasu:a:y, and Woods&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:     Well. the Treasury was beginning to be impressed by the              forgotten the level at which the Bank was operating when Woods came in.&#13;
&#13;
international balance-of-payments deficit of the United States. and the          I think was it $250 million.        At any rate, Woods wanted to operate on a&#13;

Treasury thought that the operations of the Bank were one reason for             level of a billion.    And as I think we did mention last time. one of&#13;

the deficits; and they were quite hard nosed about shutting down that            the reasons that he as very interested in the quick publication of&#13;

enlargement of IDA. at least on the scale that Woods wanted.          The Bank   morning.    (Perhaps more than that.)       1 1 11 mention them both and you can&#13;
&#13;
worked very bard and ultimately was successful in persuading the                 talk about them as you choose.          I'm interested in the source of ideas&#13;
&#13;
Treasury that in fact the Bank was not a negative influence on the               within the Bank.     What was the process by which ideas were generated in&#13;

balance of payments. which left the Bank in a curious. and. fortunately          the Bank and used?      I'm also interested in the shift in the success so&#13;
&#13;
for the Bank, almost completely unnoticed position.       Here was a great       to speak of the administration.         It has been noted by some that the&#13;
&#13;
development institution which in fact was importing dollars into the             second half of Woods' administration was. perhaps, not as salutary as&#13;
&#13;
United States from the developing countries.      That was the logical           the first half.&#13;
&#13;
inference one had to draw from this line of argument.                            GRAVES:    Nor even as salubrious I      Well on the source of ideas, I think&#13;
     What the facts are, I don't think anybody knows.         It sll in the      generally ideas are the human experience.         (I   don't want to risk any&#13;

end was a matter of book keeping:     what quantities you decide to assign       small generalities here.)      They sort of condense out of an atmosphere&#13;
&#13;
on what side of the ledger.     At any rate to my mind those were some of        in which there are a lot of thoughts being expressed or struggling for&#13;
&#13;
the particular achievements of the Woods' presidency and some of the             expression, and then, at some point, some of these thoughts crystallize,&#13;

problems.                                                                        and you have something which is called an idea.           Now Woods was very&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     While we are still on the subject of IDA, can you shed any           much the kind of person, I think, who tried to stir up an atmosphere of&#13;
&#13;
light on the discussions within the Bank as to the amount of IDA                 discussion and then to a get a crystallization. whether by himself or by&#13;

Replenishment the Bank should seek?                                              somebody else, of a thought.        I   think that this went on not only in the&#13;

&#13;
Corporation was suggested by a commission beaded by Nelson Rockefeller           paper or whatever.     And this looked like a boon to the capital&#13;

back in the early '50s. I think the idea was really not original with            exporting countries which. neverthe'less, might have a need occasionally&#13;

the air and enabled the bank to develop it further.                                      Well this discussion went on week after week in the senior staff&#13;
     Rosenstein-Roden was certainly one of the liveliest minds of the            of the Bank, which was sort of an odd place for it. but that is where&#13;

annoyed Bob Garner.   He couldn't stand all of this coruscation of               curious manner.    That this thing which had started out to be a service&#13;
thought.   There were others.   If you put the question in those terms. I        to the capital exporting members of the Bank ended up with the decision&#13;
think you will get different answers.    Raymond Cope, who was a very            that the Bank would charge higher rates of interest to its capital&#13;
exp~rienced   loan officer. was a very good man on ideas for improving           exporting members.     In fact the Bank developed something called a&#13;
&#13;
the nuts and bolts of the Bank, particularly the loan administration             "market rate" of lending for these countries.&#13;
&#13;
and that kind of thing.                                                                  They made a loan to Italy at a market rate which was s percentage&#13;

&#13;
because if this paper was going to be salable. it would have to be at           about that.        I'm also dubious about the President's Council.   The fact&#13;

a general trip to Europe in which he was more or leas universally              wondering if this is true and the extent that it contributed to his own&#13;

rebuffed). but be did that particular trip against the specific advice         discouragement in the second half of his administration.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   27                                                                          28&#13;

&#13;
GRAVES:     I don't know that George was discouraged to the point of           them a collection of anecdotes about Eugene R. Black. That was followed&#13;
&#13;
relaxing his efforts or anything like that. I doubt that.        But this      almost immediately by a telephone call from Bruce Gould to Gene saying.&#13;
&#13;
was, as I think we said at the beginning, not only a question of IDA,          "Look. if you want to put any note into public print. this is&#13;
&#13;
it was a question of entry into the U. S. capital market.        This a very   absolutely   n~   the thing to do."   So I don't want to take it in that&#13;
&#13;
serious and utterly unprecedented thing in the existence of the Bank:          direction.&#13;
&#13;
it had dire implications for the Bank to the point where we had to --               About Woods. I do think. and 1 thought before your project began.&#13;
&#13;
not shut dawn IDA operations entirely but to say, ''O.K. we'll go on           that Woods had probably done a lot more in a positive way for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
looking at projects, but we're not going to sign any commitments for           than people realized at the time or even realized after the time.       To&#13;
&#13;
swhile.w     This was really a very serious thing at the Bank.     Unkind      put it another way. to my mind. there couldn't have been any McNamara&#13;
&#13;
people say that George kind of panicked at this prospect. I don't think        if there hadn't been a Woods before. that.    And by that I mean that&#13;
&#13;
panic is necessarily the right word, but it is certain that he                 George. with all these flaws and unhappy incidents. created the kind of&#13;
&#13;
redoubled his efforts. sometimes in sort of a counterproductive way as         posture of the Bank which was necessary for its further development.&#13;
&#13;
in the case I mentioned. I think.                                              He created the kind of a staff base that was necessary for further&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well. 1 have no more questions on this subject. 1 wonder if        development.      I think he did more for the Bank than has generally been&#13;
&#13;
there are some areas of your recollections of the Bank I should have           realized. one reason being:     it's generally true about history (this is&#13;
&#13;
been asking and haven't yet.                                                   my second small generalization of this particular interview) that you&#13;

&#13;
to a serious of anecdotes. and I don't really want to take you in that         generation or two date the beginning of this particular thing to 1500&#13;
&#13;
direction.                                                                     A. D.: and then someone coaes along. who is not satisfied with the&#13;

        In the early Black administration. an effort was made. not by me.      conventional thought. and he goes back to the sources and he discovers&#13;
&#13;
this was before I caae into the Bank. to get the Goulds (I did mention         in fact that it began in 1200 A. D.     This happens time and time again&#13;
&#13;
this the last tiae we talked) to do a piece about Black in their               in the writing of History. and I think it is true in this case. because&#13;

&#13;
know.     One of the people in the Information Office at that time thought     began under Woods-- just as some of the things that Woods was given&#13;
&#13;
we could peak the interest of the Goulds in this subject by sending            credit for began under Black.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   29                                                                         30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     There is a very typical thing which is worth noting. although it         GRAVES:     Well I think that Woods -- Mike LeJeune can tell you about&#13;
&#13;
is somewhat on an anecdotal level.    George Woods' speech (I think it        this.     I think that Woods bad set a particular goal for numbers of&#13;
&#13;
was his speech at the First Annual Meeting of the Governors} frightened       econaaists in the Bank. and I think be had pretty auch reached that&#13;
&#13;
the investment community in New York and in all the proper places,            goal at the end of his administration.      Had he continued. there would&#13;

&#13;
remarks about the developing world and what the Bank was going to have        really any discernible pause.     The recruiting went on pretty much as it&#13;
&#13;
to do to meet the problems of the developing world.     This caused           had been.     Woods felt. -- at least t'o judge&#13;
&#13;
ripples of alarm through the investâ&#128;¢ent houses in North America and           by his remarks to the staff. that the chief need was for more&#13;
Europe.   In fact there bad to be a little special exercise by Bill           econoaists.     McNamara of course felt that the chief need was for more&#13;
Bennett and others to go and calm people down and say,    Â·~ook,    this is   everything.     So they continued to recruit economists. but they also&#13;
not going to threaten the integrity of the Bank's financial operations,       greatly increased their recruiting of almost every other kind of&#13;
and the bond holders don 1 t have to worry."                                  technical person.&#13;
     Well then McNamara became President of the Bank. and be gave a           OLIVER:     Was there a change in the kinds of issues that the economists&#13;

community becaae alarmed and people bad to go forth and calm people           GRAVES:     Well. I think we did a lot more non-productive econanic work&#13;
&#13;
down as though this threatened the integrity of the Bank's operations.        under HcNaaars.     I think under HcNuara the Bank has done a lot of&#13;

So this is just saying:     history does repeat itself. and also history      econoaic work that might equally well have been done by universities.&#13;

happens somewhat earlier than most people suppose.                            People could have been invited to caae into the Bank to do studies of&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
Woods time was an increase in economists.                                     from these studies into the operations of the Bank.      I think that if&#13;

            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1950 to 1975, Mr. Graves worked in the
            following areas: in the information and public affairs
            department as director (1950-1967); in the International
            Finance Corporation (IFC) as director of information
            (1961-1967); as associate director in the development
            services department (1967-1973) and in the international
