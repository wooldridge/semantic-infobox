RURAL ROAD REEIABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:          Republic of Peru&#13;
Implementing&#13;
Agency:            Ministry of Transport, Communications, Housing and Construction&#13;
Poverty Category:  Program of Targeted Interventions. The project's intends to: (a) improve&#13;
access of rural areas to markets and services, encompassing about 2.7&#13;
million people living in the initial six departments, and about 4.5 million or&#13;
20 percent of the population of Peru once the project is expanded to 12&#13;
departments; (b) form and strengthen small and medium size enterprises&#13;
and community groups that will be involved in the execution of works&#13;
financed by the project, and spur the creation of more than 250 micro-&#13;
enterprises participating in routine maintenance contracts; and (c) bring&#13;
benefits to about 100 provincial municipalities as a consequence of the&#13;
investment and institutional strengthening components included in the&#13;
project. About 35,000 one-year equivalent of non-skilled seasonal jobs&#13;
would be generated by road rehabilitation works and more than 4,000 of&#13;
non-skilled permanent jobs would be generated by road maintenance works&#13;
contracted out to micro-enterprises.&#13;
Loan Amount:       US$90 million equivalent, including up to US$9 million in retroactive&#13;
financing.&#13;
Terms:             LIBOR-based floating rate single currency loan in US dollars, payable in 17&#13;
years, including five years of grace. The loan will be amortized in level&#13;
payments of principal.&#13;
Commitment Fee:  0.75 percent on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing,&#13;
less any waiver.&#13;
Net Present Value: All sub-projects will meet eligibility criteria that assess institutional,&#13;
environmental and technical factors (including the sustainability of the&#13;
investments) as well as social and economic benefits. Social criteria based&#13;
solely on prevailing poverty indicators would be applied to sub-projects&#13;
with costs below a certain threshold. The economic criterion establishes a&#13;
benchmark minimum rate of return of 10 percent, based on a net increase in&#13;
agricultural and livestock output. The economic analyses of 76 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
the road rehabilitation sub-projects in terms of kilometers (70 percent in&#13;
terns of costs) under the pilot yields a net present value of almost US$25&#13;
million and a prorated internal economic rate of return of 44 percent.&#13;

PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILiTATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
1. RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. The Economic Setting&#13;
1.1   Peri has undergone a remarkable recovery since the inauguration of the Fujimori&#13;
administration in July 1990 which saw the implementation of the most comprehensive program of&#13;
economic reforms in the history of the country. While Peru has a generous supply of minerals,&#13;
fish and hydrocarbons, the country had seen vast fluctuations in its economy in its previous 40&#13;
years and poverty has been a long-standing problem. The reforms aimed at reducing inflation,&#13;
stabilizing the economy and radically changing the state-dominated economy into a market-&#13;
orientated one. The reforms were in large part embodied in the Constitution ratified by a close&#13;
margin in an October 1993 popular referendum. There has been a steady drop in the rate of&#13;
inflation (from 7,600 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 1994); the economy has recovered strongly&#13;
growing by 10% in 1994; and there has been enormous progress in reducing terrorism and&#13;
establishing public order.&#13;
1.2   The economic recovery has resulted in welfare increases for the vast majority of&#13;
Peruvians. In the short term, however, the benefits have not reached the poor to a sufficient&#13;
degree. Government priorities have increasingly shifted towards enhancing the access of poor&#13;
communities to mainstream economic activities by reversing the deterioration of basic&#13;
infrastructure after years of neglect. The Government is rehabilitating basic infrastructure&#13;
concentrating on areas with the highest prevalence of extreme poverty, the rural sierra and the&#13;
urban pueblos j6venes.&#13;
B. Rural Development and Poverty in Peru&#13;
1.3   After several years of slow agricultural growth, including negative growth from 1990-&#13;
1992, real agricultural GDP grew by over 6 percent in 1993 and by 13 percent in the first half of&#13;
1994. Better climatic conditions and increased rural security seem to be underlying factors for the&#13;
recovery. However, although production recovered in 1993 the levels of production were still&#13;
below average for 1986-1989 for most crops. In 1993, agriculture represented 12.3 percent of&#13;
GDP and industry (including fishing, mining and manufacturing) represented 34.1 percent of&#13;
GDP. About 40 percent of the economically active population work in the agricultural sector.&#13;
This percentage is higher in departments of the rural sierra like Huancavelica where about 60&#13;
percent work in the agricultural sector. GDP growth in the sector has been uneven while the&#13;
productivity of agricultural labor has also remained poor, improving only marginally during the&#13;
last three decades. On average, there was zero annual growth in the rate of food production per&#13;
capita between 1979 and 1992. Agricultural profitability declined with the removal of subsidies&#13;
and price control mechanisms and the decrease in world prices for many crops.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.4   Although the majority of Peru's population has traditionally been employed in the&#13;
agricultural sector, Peru6 is not an intrinsically agricultural economy. The per-capita availability of&#13;
cultivable land is only 0.13 hectares, which is less than one third the Latin American average of&#13;
0.44 and lower than the 0.18 average for Asia. Nevertheless, food products and non-elaborated&#13;
agricultural products contributed to about one third of Peru6's exports in 1993. Commercial&#13;
farming is concentrated in the costa in heavily irrigated areas where rainfall is limited and this&#13;
production accounts for 60% of agricultural GDP. The sierra, with only 18% of cultivable land,&#13;
has 36% of the country's population and relies largely on subsistence farming. The scope for a&#13;
large increase in agricultural productivity of the sierra is limited since this mountainous region&#13;
does not have a favorable natural environment for agriculture. On the other hand, the prospects&#13;
for growth of livestock farming (vacuno and alpaca) are encouraging as the price of livestock and&#13;
its byproducts has been rising. In addition, non-farm activities are important in the sierra, in&#13;
particular the production of handicrafts. The non-farm sector has also good prospects for growth&#13;
and should increasingly play a larger role in improving the standards of the rural poor.&#13;
1.5   Almost 30 percent of Perfu's population live in rural areas. The prevalence of poverty is&#13;
highest in the rural mountainous areas, where two thirds of the households are poor and 47&#13;
percent fall into the extreme poverty category. In the mountains less than half the population has&#13;
access to a public water system, and only 8 percent have access to public sewerage removal&#13;
services. The indigenous populations are much poorer than the rest of the population: they&#13;
account for 40 percent of the extremely poor and 25 percent of the poor. In health, the situation&#13;
has been worse in some rural areas, due to long-standing regional and ethnic inequalities. Infant&#13;
mortality rates are three times higher in rural areas than in metropolitan Lima. For example, while&#13;
the infant mortality rate averaged 58 per 1,000 births for the whole country, in the department of&#13;
Huancavelica, in the rural sierra, the rates were 107 deaths per 1,000 births in 1993. In nutrition,&#13;
in 1993, while 48 % of primary school children were defined as being chronically malnourished,&#13;
this was concentrated in the rural areas where 64% were chronically malnourished as compared to&#13;
34% in urban areas. In 1991, malnutrition affected as much as 73 percent of children under the&#13;
age of 5 in some rural areas (compared to 13 percent for the whole country). In education, in&#13;
1991, about 29 percent of the rural population was illiterate (compared to 15 percent for the&#13;
whole country), and 44 percent of rural women could not read or write.&#13;
1.6   Against this background, the enhanced macroeconomic conditions have laid the ground&#13;
for improvements in poverty indicators. A July 1994 survey stated that total poverty in Peru&#13;
declined from 54% in 1991 to 46% in 1994, and extreme poverty declined from 22% to 18% over&#13;
the same period. This decline in poverty levels has been attributed to the recovery of the&#13;
economy together with the implementation of various social programs in the last few years.&#13;
Nonetheless, the prevalence of both poverty and extreme poverty remains high in the rural sierra&#13;
with levels of 66 percent and 44 percent, respectively (Table 1). The rural sierra is estimated to&#13;
contain the largest number of extremely poor (about 1.6 million people) while, because of its size,&#13;
metropolitan Lima contains the largest number of poor (about 2.5 million people). The more&#13;
modest impact on poverty reduction to date in the rural sierra, reflects the depth and&#13;
intransigence of economic stagnation in rural Peru. Decades of uneven distribution of the benefits&#13;
of development, and the difficulty of expanding small scale improvements in economic and social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
infrastructure and delivering services outside the cities, has contributed to a slower pace of&#13;
recovery and reform in rural Peru.&#13;

C. Government Strategy for Rural Development and Poverty Eradication&#13;
1.7   In the face of overwhelming problems in the social sectors, particularly for the indigenous&#13;
community, the Government established in 1990 a social emergency program to provide direct&#13;
food and health assistance to the poor. This program was replaced in August 1991 by&#13;
FONCODES, the National Fund for Social Compensation and Development, a mechanism for&#13;
channeling government and external resources to labor-intensive projects. FONCODES, which is&#13;
centrally administered, encourages close involvement of community representatives, and responds&#13;
to demands from poor communities for rehabilitating social and economic infrastructure, and&#13;
improving access to basic social services.&#13;
1.8   In early 1993, the Government prepared its first poverty alleviation strategy. This strategy&#13;
focused on the promotion of broad based economic growth and the improvement in the living&#13;
conditions of the extreme poor through FONCODES as well as through food assistance, health,&#13;
and education programs coordinated through the Ministries of Health and Education. It&#13;
concentrated on targeting programs to the rural areas, particularly the rural sierra, where the&#13;
extreme poor are concentrated. This strategy has already begun to show results as indicated by a&#13;
decline in the percentage of those living in extreme poverty, detailed in the previous section.&#13;
1.9   Recognizing that the absolute numbers of poor are still high, among the highest in Latin&#13;
America, the Government, with the goal of poverty eradication in mind, has been broadening its&#13;
efforts at poverty reduction beyond FONCODES and centrally administered and funded programs&#13;
in the social sectors. These programs circumvent local governments, and while many are effective&#13;
in getting things done, their sustainability is uncertain. The Government has, (1) started&#13;
extensive programs, with local government involvement, to rehabilitate and maintain long&#13;
neglected basic infrastructure starting with roads and water supply and sanitation networks, (2)&#13;
initiated a program to rationalize social sector expenditure, (3) instituted a series of integrated&#13;
rural development projects implemented through FONCODES, (4) established a pilot program of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
decentralization of responsibility and funding for primary education in two school districts, (5)&#13;
decentralized responsibility for FONCODES project approval to select qualified local offices, and&#13;
(6) made initial efforts at improved central coordination of programs.&#13;
1.10  To consolidate and solidify these various efforts, the Government has initiated efforts to&#13;
rethink its poverty strategy. It is now developing a strategy with a longer term view toward social&#13;
integration and efficiency in service delivery. This strategy, which is under preparation to be&#13;
presented at the third Consultative Group, planned for October 1995, will continue to recognize&#13;
that the promotion of broad-based growth is key to poverty reduction efforts. Other essential&#13;
elements include increasing the efficiency of public sector service provision through: (1)&#13;
decentralization of infrastructure and social services which will require strengthening of local&#13;
governments and funding to match responsibility, (2) coordination of programs within central&#13;
government and with local governments, (3) clarification of the role of FONCODES, FONAVI&#13;
vis a vis other programs, (4) recasting and strengthening of central government functions&#13;
complementary to decentralization, and (5) further rationalization of expenditures. Further, the&#13;
strategy should ensure that programs are environmentally sustainable, and reach the indigenous&#13;
population and the large informal sector. In addition, it should clarify the role of the private&#13;
sector in infrastructure and social service provision.&#13;
D. Transport Sector Overview&#13;
1.11   The Peruvian transport system comprises: i) a classified road network of nearly 70,000&#13;
kin, of which about 11 percent is paved; ii) a system of 24 maritime and river ports; iii) a railway&#13;
network (about 2,000 km) made up of seven separate systems, with little physical or operational&#13;
integration; iv) 300 airports and landing strips, only 16 of which have paved runways; and v) a&#13;
system of pipelines, the most important of which is the 900 km North Peruvian pipeline from the&#13;
oil fields in the selva to the coast at Bayovar. Similar to trends in most other countries, the road&#13;
sector has increasingly predominated in the transport of passengers and freight across Peru6 (Table&#13;
2). In 1992, roads carried 71% of freight tons, followed by river and (mainly) coastal shipping&#13;
with 25%. Railways have decreased their participation to 4%, though they play an important role&#13;
along particular corridors (Callao-Huancayo and Matarani-Puno). Air freight transport hardly&#13;
reaches 0.1%. Passenger traffic largely moves by road, with the railways playing a critical role&#13;
along specific corridors that lack adequate access roads.&#13;

1.12  Transport infrastructure provision and operations have been concentrated in the hands of&#13;
public sector enterprises. Recent reforms aim at commercializing operations, transferring services&#13;
to the private sector, and reducing the level of public involvement in the construction and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
operations of the various transport infrastructure. One of the initial actions in this respect was the&#13;
privatization of the national airline carrier--Aeroperu--and the transfer of port operations to the&#13;
private sector. On-going efforts include the privatization of the railway company--ENAFER--and&#13;
the creation of a road authority that would increase the financial autonomy for the maintenance of&#13;
the national road network. These efforts are being supported by Loan 3717-PE. Annex 1&#13;
summarizes the main characteristics of the transport sub-sectors and details government actions&#13;
on each of them.&#13;
E. The Road Transport Sector&#13;
1.13  The Road Sector. Road transport is the dominant mode of domestic transport in Peru,&#13;
carrying about 70 percent of domestic freight traffic and 80 percent of inter-urban passenger&#13;
traffic. Yet PeruI has the lowest endowment in road infrastructure especially in terms of paved&#13;
roads compared to peer countries in Latin America. The condition of the road system in Perui is&#13;
not satisfactory to support national economic and social goals. From 1986 to 1991, investments&#13;
in the road sector were very limited. Reflecting a dramatic declining trend, the percentage of&#13;
government expenditures dedicated to the transport sector decreased from 6.1 percent in 1981 to&#13;
2.5 percent in 1990. Since 1991, investments have grown incrementally, reaching a level of&#13;
US$370 million in 1994, largely fueled by the multilateral and bilateral-financed programs of road&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation (Table 3). Analyses performed by the Planning Office of the&#13;
Ministry of Transport, Communications, Housing and Construction (MTC) indicate that the level&#13;
of investment would have to reach about US$600 million per year in order to bring the road&#13;
network to satisfactory standards.&#13;

1.14 Road Network. The Peruvian road network comprises about 70,000 km of roads of&#13;
which about 11 percent are paved roads, about 19 percent are gravel roads, while the remaining&#13;
70 percent are earth and non-engineered roads. This road network is organized into three tiers&#13;
consisting of(1) about 16,000 km of national roads, (2) about 14,000 km of secondary or&#13;
departmental roads, and (3) about 40,000 km of rural roads (see Table 4). The road system&#13;
deteriorated badly in the 80s due to mismanagement, severe financial constraints and deferred&#13;
maintenance practices. Government's emphasis on the strategic rehabilitation of the existing&#13;
infrastructure is reversing this trend. While the condition of the national network has improved&#13;
since 1990 as a result of on-going rehabilitation and maintenance programs supported by IDB, the&#13;
Bank and other donors, conditions on the secondary and rural networks remain critical. The poor&#13;
reliability of these roads also negatively affects the cost of road usage. The lack of all weather&#13;
roads coupled with poor maintenance practices and adverse topographical and climatic conditions,&#13;
render large segments of the rural road network impassable or very costly to users. This has&#13;
impeded development and contributed to the isolation of poor rural communities, particularly in&#13;
the mountainous sierra, where 66 percent of the population is poor and about 1.6 million&#13;
inhabitants live in extreme poverty.&#13;

1.15  Institutional Set-up. Administration of roads in Peru has gone through fundamental&#13;
changes in the last decade, in part due to a protracted decentralization process which is still far&#13;
from being settled. Historically, MTC's General Directorate of Highways (DGC) had overall&#13;
responsibility for the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of the entire road system.&#13;
The Regionalization Law (1984) transferred all roads to the newly established regional&#13;
governments. This mandate was partially reversed in 1991, when MTC was reassigned the&#13;
responsibility for managing the national road network, while departmental and rural roads&#13;
remained under the control of regional and local governments. Departmental and rural roads&#13;
receive insufficient attention from the various agencies falling under the jurisdiction of regional&#13;
and local governments. A weak institutional base, ill-defined responsibilities, and strong&#13;
dependence on central government budgetary allocations have prevented regional governments&#13;
from delivering more responsive services and coordinating development programs. Presently, the&#13;
future of Regional Governments is uncertain under the government's decentralization agenda.&#13;
1.16  The Municipal Law (Ley Organica de Municipalidades) passed in 1984 made provincial&#13;
and district municipalities responsible for rural roads planning, construction and maintenance,&#13;
responsibility that is shared with regional governments in the absence of sufficient resources. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Law establishes a distinction between provincial and district municipalities. However, functional&#13;
assignments between them are ambiguous in as much as both types of municipalities are given&#13;
largely the same set of responsibilities (though the legislation gives more prominence to the role&#13;
of the provincial municipalities). Such responsibilities, however, are not commensurate with the&#13;
institutional and financial capacity of those municipalities. This, compounded with ambiguities&#13;
and overlaps in the roles of the different levels of government and inherited dependency from&#13;
central government, results in a generalized avoidance of accountability in the sector. In response&#13;
to the weaknesses of local governments, community-based organizations have intervened in an&#13;
attempt to fill the gap and cope with the most compelling needs, but these efforts have been&#13;
isolated and unsustained. The result is a very large rehabilitation backlog and the poor&#13;
serviceability of the departmental and rural road network.&#13;
1.17  Road Financing. Currently, road users are charged taxes on the consumption of&#13;
automotive fuels, license registration fees, and tolls on thirteen major national roads (as of end&#13;
1994). Taxes on automotive fuels vary between 40 and 55 percent at the pump depending on the&#13;
type of gasoline or diesel. In 1993, these taxes (both the value-added tax--representing 30&#13;
percent of the revenues--and a selective consumption tax) generated about US$650 million or 16&#13;
percent of the total central government revenues. Revenues collected through tolls amounted to&#13;
about US$16 million in 1994 while license registration fees, mostly collected by municipal&#13;
governments, are negligible. With an annual budget of about US$370 million for road transport&#13;
projects, user charges (net of the general value-added tax) would cover the maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation costs of existing infrastructure. However, tax revenues are incorporated into the&#13;
general central treasury (or municipal treasury in the case of registration taxes) and only toll&#13;
revenues are directly collected and managed by MTC. As most of the revenues are collected by&#13;
the central government, local entities depend on transfers to be able to finance their&#13;
responsibilities in road transport. These responsibilities already translate into budgets in which&#13;
public transport projects--including the construction and rehabilitation of roads--constitute the&#13;
largest percentage of the investments (about 26 and 30 percent for provincial and district&#13;
municipalities, respectively).&#13;
1.18  For most municipalities, a principal source of revenue is the intergovernmental transfer&#13;
channeled through the Municipal Compensation Fund (MCF). The MCF is financed from a 2&#13;
percent surcharge (equal to about 10 percent of the receipts) on the national Value Added Tax,&#13;
along with an 8 percent share of the gasoline tax and with two other minor revenue sources.&#13;
There is a high degree of variation among the municipalities in terms of their dependence on these&#13;
transfers which are 80 percent earmarked for expenditures on capital investments. While the 12&#13;
largest municipalities outside Lima depend upon the transfers for only 12 percent of their&#13;
revenues, the 51 poorest municipalities depend upon the transfers for 80 percent of their revenues.&#13;
The latter clearly lack the capacity to raise funds locally to any meaningful extent. The fiscal&#13;
autonomy of municipal governments is very limited. They cannot impose taxes or determine tax&#13;
rates - these are determined at central level, and the same tax rate structure applies to all&#13;
municipalities. Municipalities can generally update tax bases, except for property tax (the main&#13;
municipal tax) which is updated by the National Council of Assessments. Overall, a lack of&#13;
transparency in the allocation of responsibilities and in the assignment of resources to the different&#13;
levels of government does not render a level and a structure of user charges that are both&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
sufficient to cover the maintenance and rehabilitation needs of the road network and equitable in&#13;
charging users in accordance with their contribution to road damage (and other externalities).&#13;
Progress on this matter is being monitored in connection with Loan 3713-PE, and will be further&#13;
developed for the particular case of the rural road network under a study that will be carried out&#13;
under this project.&#13;
1.19   Road Infrastructure and Transport Services. The importance of rural infrastructure&#13;
and transport services is reflected in the results of a 204-household indicative survey of rural&#13;
communities' access to transport, markets, input supply systems and social services. Table 5&#13;
disaggregates the average distance from sample households to various services by department.&#13;
The table suggests that access to motorized transport is lowest in the sierra departments, where&#13;
the project would be initiated. Table 6 shows the percentage distribution of distances between a&#13;
random set of 204 households and motorized transport, markets, schools, health posts, and other&#13;
facilities. Though a large percentage of households appear to have access to motorized transport,&#13;
access to important services such as health and secondary schools, markets, and technical&#13;
assistance entail travel over relatively large distances. The table also reflects the centrality of&#13;
transport infrastructure for technical assistance in agriculture.&#13;

1.20   Boxes 1, 2 and 3 illustrate how transport availability affects economic development and&#13;
poverty in Cajamarca and Cuzco. In the first case (Box 1), poor roads have resulted in high&#13;
production and service costs and risks, and have led to inappropriate technical choices. The&#13;
second case (Box 2) shows how a municipal government and the local transport organization&#13;
worked together to provide transport along an unprofitable route by cross-subsidization from&#13;
high-volume routes. Road rehabilitation and maintenance would decrease the overall vehicle and&#13;
managerial costs, increase the reliability of services, and reduce the costs to all the passengers and&#13;
transport operators. In the third case (Box 3), high transport costs along the poorly-maintained&#13;
roads surrounding the town of Ccorca and connecting it to Cuzco detract the commercial margins&#13;
of rural potato producers. To accommodate the high transport costs and the deficient road&#13;
conditions farmers are forced to use less-efficient means of transport.&#13;
Box 2 Passenger transport enterprise of "Santisima Cruz de Motupe"&#13;
Santisimna Cruz de Motupe (SCM) is a local transport organization that manages a fleet of 60 smal vans&#13;
servicing the periphery iof Cajamarca. This case shows how the regulatory powers of the municipality combined&#13;
with the managerial economies of scale at the private local transport organization converged to provide service of&#13;
acceptable cost:and frequency to low income, sparsely populated peripheral areas.&#13;
The municipality negotiated with and granted to SCM operation rights lover a combination of high-profit&#13;
and deficitary routes, :so transport service providers could operate profitably whilekservicing the low-revenue routes.&#13;
Incentives and Mregulationsi had to complement proper route mixtures and scheduling to deter the relatively&#13;
autonomous operators from concentrating on the profitable routes and neglecting the peripheral routes. To provide&#13;
operators with Ian incentive to serve:the deficitary routes, the municipal government (a) limited entry to the&#13;
profitable routes by non-affiliated transport operators, (b) reduced the cost and red tape needed to renew opeiration&#13;
permits, and (c) used its influence to prevent graft at the contracted routes. SCM, in turn, (a) agreed to pay and&#13;
supervise four controllers to monitor schedule and route compliance by all operators, and (b) negotiated preferential&#13;
group insurance rates for all affiliates.&#13;
Box 3: The Comuneros of Ccorca&#13;
Ccorca is a rural town of 4000 people located about 25 km from Cuzco. For centuries, sma11 farmers in&#13;
Ccorca have planted potatoes for household consumption and trading; Market pricesfor potatoes have a high&#13;
transport content, because potatoes are bulky and heavy. Fann-gate prices for.a sack of potatoes in Ccorca, for&#13;
instance, are about US$ 1.50, while market prices in Cuzco are close US$ 3.00. The price differential results:&#13;
mostly from transport costs, as there are no further processing. storage or packaging charges,:and:the potato&#13;
marets in  Cuzco are: fairly competitve. When transport conditions deteriorate, prices and marketing margins ate&#13;
affected..: Faced withmincreasing:transport costs, some farners use back porterage :and pack animals, but those less:&#13;
able tocay heavy loads or keepgporterage animals endure smaller incomes.&#13;
1.21   Box 4 summarizes some of the comments made by rural people who assisted to four&#13;
beneficiary-participant workshops during the appraisal mission (May-June 1995). The summary&#13;
highlights the benefits from road rehabilitation as perceived by the beneficiaries themselves. The&#13;
workshops appear to be a powerful means for mobilizing the public around transport issues and&#13;
creating ownership for project implementation. Overall, the field experiences validated the&#13;
approach taken for defining the project's objectives and performance indicators (summarized in&#13;
the logical framework given in Annex 3), the structure of its demand-driven approach (para. 3.8),&#13;
and the development of its social and economic justification (para. 3.10).&#13;

Box 4: Te View from the Beneficiawy Communities&#13;
During the appraisal mission (May-June 1995), four workshops were organized with the direct&#13;
participation of beneficiaries. TIwo involved community leaders (e.g., mayors) and heads of base organizations&#13;
(e.g., NGOs) in Cusco and Huancavelica; the other two involved open discussion with whole conunuities in one-&#13;
day meetings in the towns of Ccorca (Ctuzco) and Izcuchaca (Huancavelica). The following is a summary of the&#13;
participants' views on road transportation issues:&#13;
*  the road is too steep, too narrow, with too many curves; and bridges will not support average truck weight,&#13;
liniiting the supply of transport services and increasing transport costs&#13;
* high transport costs affect negatively not only prices and the timely delivery of market products but also the&#13;
cost of products imported into villages&#13;
*  the road becomes slippery when it rains, making it impossible for trucks to pass; the community is then&#13;
deprived of selling its products and obtaining the necessary production inputs&#13;
*  during the winter, there is no traffic due to potholes and the rains that flood the roads; the community is&#13;
isolated and cut from critical health and education services; all year-round, health providers and teachers do&#13;
not visit the village because of bad road conditions&#13;
*  with limited production and limited health and education services, people are emigrating and those who stay&#13;
are becoming poorer and poorer&#13;
* bad road conditions limit the frequency and quality of transport services; with limited services, operators have&#13;
the prerogative to accept passengers and the type of products to be transported, better road conditions will&#13;
bring more and better transport services and increased competition&#13;
*  with poor access, the quality of health and education services in the communities declines markedly because&#13;
professional doctors and teachers do not want to serve those communities, even when the basic facilities are in&#13;
place&#13;
*  well-maintained roads would allow improved transport services and commerce with neighboring&#13;
communities and progressive substitution of animal by vehicular transport&#13;
*  there should be a permanent public information campaign to make communities aware of their dependency on&#13;
roads in good condition for their well-being and development&#13;
*  important to reach a multi-sector agreement (among transport experts, comuneros, transport operators, etc.) to&#13;
ensure future support and execution of road maintenance&#13;
1.22   Road Construction Industry. There are about 1,300 construction firms registered in&#13;
CONSULCOP (Consejo Superior de Licitacionesy Contratos de 0bras Piblicas). Only 40 are&#13;
specialized in road construction, and their capacity is presently overburdened by the major road&#13;
construction programs that are currently taking place at a national level after a long period of&#13;
inactivity. A survey undertaken in 6 departments in connection with the preparation of the&#13;
proposed project showed that there is a large number of medium and small size contractors that&#13;
operate at the regional and local levels; out of the 285 firms surveyed, Ill have sufficient capacity&#13;
to undertake road rehabilitation contracts ranging from US$200,000-US$250,000. Some of them&#13;
are established informally due to the high cost of registration in CONSULCOP and the occasional&#13;
nature of their activities. The lack of financial resources at regional and local levels has prevented&#13;
these contractors from prospering and benefiting from a steady workload.&#13;
F. Rural Road Sector Issues&#13;
1.23   The broad national issue of administrative decentralization to local governments has a&#13;
major bearing on the solutions to sector issues. Government decision-making is highly&#13;
centralized, and the government has yet to define and implement its decentralization agenda. As&#13;
presently envisaged, the agenda aims at strengthening the role of municipalities, especially district&#13;
municipalities, vis-a-vis regional governments. So far it is neither clear whether the Regions will&#13;
continue in the present form nor the functions that will be assigned --if any-- to the adopted&#13;

inter-agency coordination, planning and maintenance, funding of road expenditures.&#13;
1.24  Institutional Organization. As with other sectors of the economy, the allocation of&#13;
responsibilities to regional and local governments in the road sector is far from settled.&#13;
Responsibility for construction, improvement and maintenance of roads other than the national&#13;
highways is not clearly defined and those outlined in the existing legislation have never been&#13;
matched by the resources and authority necessary to fulfill the designated functions (see para.&#13;
1.17). Furthermore, the present circumstances are characterized by ambiguity and overlap in roles&#13;
and responsibilities between all levels and by inter-government fiscal and financial arrangements&#13;
that encourage dependency, conflict and the avoidance of accountability.&#13;
1.25  While it is recognized that it will take time to address the variety of issues arising from the&#13;
incipient decentralization process, the proposed project would provide a venue for sustained&#13;
dialogue on the key policies in the rural roads sector. It will help MTC review the current&#13;
functional classification of roads and clarify the responsibilities of the organizations in charge of&#13;
the different road links in each network, taking into account their constitutional and legal&#13;
responsibilities as well as capacity to assume these responsibilities (see para. 1.32).&#13;
1.26  Inter-agency Coordination. A recent study in several departments in the sierra found&#13;
that MTC, the CTARs through their sector secretariats, provincial and district municipalities, and&#13;
seven deconcentrated units of the central government are involved in road construction and&#13;
maintenance (Table 7). This has added more confusion to the institutional organization. Because&#13;
of their inherent weakness, the CTARs have been unable to plan rural development and&#13;
coordinate these initiatives.&#13;
1.27  The proposed project would foster development of coordinated strategies at the provincial&#13;
and departmental level. The Project Implementation Unit (see para. 3.1) will provide a strong&#13;
focal point for overall coordination during project implementation. In addition, staff of MTC's&#13;
Planning Office will also be trained as part of the project to, among other functions, coordinate&#13;
investments with other sector ministries who have development and poverty alleviation programs&#13;
targeting the same provinces. MEF will ensure consistency of the overall budget allocations. But&#13;
more importantly, better coordination in the programming and execution of investments will be&#13;
achieved among the deconcentrated units of those institutions through the criteria adopted for&#13;
selection of sub-projects. The increased access to basic social and economic infrastructure by the&#13;
rural poor may not fully materialize in the absence of a coordinated effort where road&#13;
improvements are followed by other investments intended to increase economic productivity and&#13;
coverage of basic needs.&#13;
1.28 Rural Road Planning and Maintenance. An area with clear scope for improvement at&#13;
all levels is that of rural road planning and maintenance. The issue of sustainable maintenance in&#13;
Peru is very complex because it entails institutional and financial reforms, and cannot be addressed&#13;
without clarifying responsibilities, setting a basic institutional framework, and progressively.&#13;

building MTC and local governments' capacity to deliver day-to-day maintenance throughout the&#13;
entire road network. The deteriorated condition of the secondary and rural road networks calls&#13;
for a two-part strategy: i) an extensive rehabilitation program to bring roads up to a condition&#13;
where they can be maintained; and ii) a maintenance program, which will cover the "core"&#13;
improved road network and progressively extend to other road links until the entire road system is&#13;
subject to routine maintenance. To maximize the impact of the former, investment planning and&#13;
programmning needs to be improved by setting prioritization criteria with economic and social&#13;
factors clearly incorporated into them. For the latter to succeed, its implementation arrangements&#13;
must be tailored to the capacity of the implementing agencies. The project supports this strategy.&#13;
Another important step would be to complete an inventory of roads, on which basis the needs of&#13;
each administrative level and individual jurisdiction can be identified and the resources required&#13;
made available (see para. 1.32). Emphasis will be given to coordinating transport activities&#13;
between provincial municipalities and their districts, with the former taking the lead as they&#13;
present better prospects for success due to their stronger capacity as well as economies of scale&#13;
that derive from their larger size.&#13;
1.29  Rural Roads Funding. The resources available to local governments are very limited.&#13;
While at the national level, revenues from road users (gasoline taxes, taxes on vehicle imports and&#13;
ownership) have historically exceeded government expenditure on roads, local governments have&#13;
no similar buoyant source of local revenue, and largely depend on a centrally controlled property&#13;
tax and on intergovernmental transfers. Most of these transfers are allocated through the FCM,&#13;
which gives roughly US$300 millions per year to provincial and district municipalities on the basis&#13;
of population and infant mortality (see para. 1.17). About 80 percent of these funds are&#13;
earmarked for capital investments. In the absence of a decentralization of responsibilities over the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
secondary network (or an adequate source of local revenue to cope with its maintenance needs),&#13;
maintenance of the secondary network may be severely underfunded. Similarly, rural roads will&#13;
remain poorly maintained as long as the local governments have no appropriate revenue sources.&#13;
The issue of securing the flow of funds for maintenance is being addressed in the context of the&#13;
reorganization of the sector.&#13;
Government Strategy&#13;
1.30 Since January 1995, Government has embarked on a long-term effort to restructure road&#13;
sector management to improve its efficiency and effectiveness, in a process that involves&#13;
consultation with key government officials, representatives of the private sector, as well as IDB,&#13;
the Bank and GTZ. This started with a policy workshop to review the roles of the various levels&#13;
of government and the private sector in road sector administration and development. The&#13;
Government's strategy is designed to arrest the deterioration of the road network by (a) defining a&#13;
decentralization agenda that would clarify responsibilities over the three-tier road network and&#13;
resources to attend those responsibilities; (b) strengthening road administration, promoting private&#13;
sector participation, and building up capacity at the local level; (c) increasing budgetary&#13;
allocations for road rehabilitation and maintenance; and (d) focusing investments on areas with&#13;
high levels of poverty and emphasizing labor-based construction methods as a means to generate&#13;
employment in those areas.&#13;
Box 5: Main Tenets of Government's Road Transport Sector Strategy&#13;
* redirect the role of government (central and local) in the provision of road infrastructure&#13;
* strengthen first the deconcentration then the decentralization of the sector administration&#13;
*  continue strategic rehabilitation of key networks and removal of bottlenecks to reduce vehicle operating costs&#13;
*  ensure the necessary mechanisms to attend emergencies and disasters&#13;
* allocate resources to address the chronic lag of road infrastructure,provision, especially to the poor of rural&#13;
and:marginal urban areas&#13;
*  generate employment through programs of rehabilitation and maintenance of main roads and rural roads&#13;
* promote private sector investments in the sector through the application of Law Decree No. 758&#13;
. promote transport technological developments and better services in urban areas.&#13;

1.31   This strategy translates into priorities in the rehabilitation of the three-tier road system,&#13;
investments along the intermodal corridors that connect the coast and the inlands, and the&#13;
facilitation of private sector participation in railways, airports and ports (see Box 5). Within the&#13;
rural roads sub-sector, the government aims at implementing a wide-ranging program of road&#13;
rehabilitation in order to improve the quality of life of rural areas, enhance the accessibility of&#13;
rural areas to markets, promote the return of the peasant population to the rural areas, and, in all,&#13;
activate the rural economy. The long term goal is to progressively rehabilitate the whole of the&#13;
40,000 km. of the rural network. To start with, Government has designed a six-year rural road&#13;
program (1995-2000) that targets more than 30 percent of the rural road network, with priorities&#13;
established on the basis of: (1) the percentage of rural population; (2) the poverty indicators; (3)&#13;
the existence of parallel programs of social stabilization, and (4) the commitment of the local&#13;
population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
1.32  At an operational level, Government is taking steps to:&#13;
(a)   refocus MTC's mission on policy-making, investment planning, coordination&#13;
among transport modes, road usage regulation, and monitoring transport system&#13;
performance. To ensure that this mission is consistently carried out in the rural&#13;
road sector, key staff in the Planning Office will be trained under of the proposed&#13;
project (para. 3.1);&#13;
(b)   clarify the roles and responsibilities for road administration at the various levels of&#13;
government, in line with Government's decentralization agenda. Government has&#13;
decided that responsibility over rural roads falls under local government, with&#13;
financial and institutional support from MTC (initially channeled through the&#13;
proposed project). Responsibility over national and departmental roads, the latter&#13;
on a temporary basis until the agenda for political and administrative&#13;
decentralization is defined, falls under central government. In June 1995, MTC&#13;
revised the functional classification of all public roads (Decree 09-95), and is now&#13;
undertaking the inventory of the roads under responsibility of central government.&#13;
The inventory of the rural road network will be gradually carried out under the&#13;
proposed project;&#13;
(c)   establish a road agency, with technical, administrative and financial autonomy to&#13;
manage the national road network (and temporarily the departmental road network&#13;
with assistance from the proposed project). Key features of the proposed&#13;
legislation include (1) contracting out most of the work to the private sector,&#13;
including ample use of road concessions and Build-Operate-Transfer schemes, and&#13;
(2) operating under private sector labor regime, which will enable attracting&#13;
qualified staff MTC plans to submit to Congress legislation in this regard and&#13;
complete a study to define the organizational details; and&#13;
(d)   ensure the sustained funding of road maintenance at the central level and develop&#13;
mechanisms for financing maintenance of rural roads, consistent with the evolution&#13;
of Government's decentralization agenda. The latter is part of a broader policy&#13;
dialogue that aims at allocating revenue raising and administrative responsibilities&#13;
among the various levels of government in Peru. A study to propose more&#13;
appropriate mechanisms for financing maintenance of rural roads will be&#13;
undertaken under the proposed project (see para. 2.25).&#13;
1.33  IDB and the Bank have been involved in the definition and implementation of the&#13;
Government strategy in the road sector, and would continue doing so, in the context of the&#13;
supervision of their on-going highway projects (Bank's Ln. 3717-PE and IDB's 65 1-OC-PE and&#13;
836-OC-PE).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

G. Previous Bank Involvement in the Transport Sector&#13;
1.34  Previous Bank experience. Since 1952, the Bank has made 18 loans to Pernu in the&#13;
transport sector totaling US$641 million. However, only 52 percent (or two-thirds if the most&#13;
recent Transport Rehabilitation Project is not considered) have been disbursed. Of the total, 46&#13;
percent has been for highways, 17 percent for urban projects (a large part of which had urban&#13;
transport components), 12 percent for multi-modal projects, 12 percent for aviation, 9 percent for&#13;
railways, and 3 percent for ports. In the rural infrastructure sector, the Bank has also an on-going&#13;
US$100 million loan to support FONCODES, which includes funding for labor-intensive projects&#13;
in poor rural areas (about one third of the project consists of developing economic infrastructure&#13;
in rural areas).&#13;
1.35   Other donors are also active in the transport sector in Perui. Notably, IDB has approved&#13;
two road rehabilitation loans totaling US$462 million, and is participating in this project with&#13;
US$90 million. CAF (Corporaci6n Andina de Fomento) approved a US$50 million loan to&#13;
contribute toward the cost of the first IDB road rehabilitation project, and is expected to approve&#13;
very soon another loan for about US$75-100 million to develop the Ilo-Desaguadero Corridor.&#13;
Government has also obtained US$30 million from the US, and grants from Japan for studies,&#13;
rehabilitation of locomotives and acquisition of road maintenance equipment. As part of the&#13;
cofinancing arrangements for the Bank's Transport Rehabilitation Project, the OPEC Fund for&#13;
Development and KfW are participating with US$5 million and about US$38 million loans&#13;
respectively, the latter not yet approved. Annex 2 provides more details on Bank, IDB and other&#13;
donor lending in the Transport sector in Peruz.&#13;
1.36  Lessons learned. Aside from the macroeconomic conditions which beset the country in&#13;
1983 and led to the default on the Government's debt service payments to the Bank and hence to&#13;
the suspension of disbursements, lack of counterpart funds and institutional weakness have often&#13;
been the main reasons for the unsatisfactory performance of delays in transport projects. Besides,&#13;
implementation of these projects has been difficult due to the technical problems caused by&#13;
extreme physical conditions, inadequate engineering designs, and weak project management&#13;
aggravated by low salary levels of professionals in the executing agencies. The creation of the&#13;
PERT as the unit which is implementing the Transport Rehabilitation Project as well as the IDB&#13;
projects has attempted to address those shortcomings.&#13;
1.37  Road components were included in eight Bank loans to Peru which supported overall&#13;
highway development, transport corridor improvements, rural development, and reconstruction&#13;
after a major disaster. Experience exists with free-standing feeder road projects elsewhere,&#13;
especially in Africa and Asia. The principal problems in achieving sustainable results have been&#13;
(1) institutional weaknesses and inadequate coordination, leading to delays in implementation and&#13;
incomplete execution of the works; (2) inadequate monitoring of results.&#13;
1.38  Bank-wide experience has resulted in the following advice for designing a successful rural&#13;
roads project: i) there should be a strong government commitment and beneficiary participation in&#13;
defining priorities and funding for maintenance to ensure the sustainability of services and&#13;
infrastructure; ii) a central focal point should be established for formulating and reviewing rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
roads policy, for project planning and execution, and for coordination between the ministries of&#13;
agriculture, interior and transport; iii) a strong and dedicated project management team should be&#13;
created to assure timely implementation and adequate monitoring of the project; and iv) the&#13;
capacity for labor-based methods and intermediate means of transport should be developed.&#13;
These lessons have been incorporated in the design of the present project.&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin of the Project&#13;
2.1   Peru's badly deteriorated infrastructure limits its capacity to compete abroad and inhibits&#13;
economic growth. Transport infrastructure suffered from years of neglect and mismanagement.&#13;
To reverse this trend, Government has embarked on major institutional and policy reforms aimed&#13;
at improving efficiency in the delivery of transport services, and on strategic rehabilitation of key&#13;
road, railway and airport facilities. Rehabilitation of more than 6,000 km of main highways is&#13;
underway with the support ofthe Bank, IDB and other donors (see para.1.35). Yet the needs for&#13;
improved transport services and access in rural areas are staggering. This is quite evident in the&#13;
rural sierra, where poor access has led to isolation and contributed to extreme poverty. Perceived&#13;
as a prerequisite for distribution of improved living conditions, economic wealth and social&#13;
balance, in May 1994 Government requested both the Bank and IDB to support the proposed&#13;
project to address the needs for alleviating poverty and raising the living standards of the rural&#13;
poor by improving access to agricultural zones through rehabilitation and maintenance of the rural&#13;
road network.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.2   The Bank has been assisting the Government implement its poverty eradication efforts.&#13;
Initial efforts focused on the design and implementation of the stabilization and structural reform&#13;
program, key to the resurgence of growth. Under the Structural Adjustment Loan, the Bank&#13;
supported the Government's efforts to design the first poverty alleviation strategy. Following the&#13;
1993 clearance of arrears accumulated to the Bank since 1987, the Bank reinitiated investment&#13;
lending by offering a $100 million loan to the Government to support FONCODES. Loans for&#13;
basic health and nutrition, primary education, transportation rehabilitation and water rehabilitation&#13;
and management have followed. Additional loans are under preparation for irrigation&#13;
rehabilitation and rural electrification.&#13;
2.3   This project, the Rural Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance project, following the&#13;
Government's longer-term vision, is focused on local government service delivery and&#13;
maintenance. It is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board on&#13;
November 22, 1994, which has poverty reduction as its central objective, and concentrates on (1)&#13;
infrastructure development, (2) social sector development, (3) institution building, and (4)&#13;
macroeconomic sustainability.&#13;
2.4   The project would bolster infrastructure development by supporting a comprehensive road&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance program to arrest deterioration of the existing road system in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
rural sierra, safeguarding key social and economic links, and providing a framework for further&#13;
assistance to the rural road subsector. Bank's experience on free-standing feeder road projects&#13;
elsewhere, especially in Africa and Asia, has been incorporated into the design of the project.&#13;
Dialogue between the Government and the Bank during preparation resulted in stricter definition&#13;
of sub-project eligibility criteria, in-depth elaboration of community participatory mechanisms,&#13;
and stronger emphasis on institutional development matters. The project will have a positive&#13;
demonstration effect, and should be considered as a complement to the on-going Transport&#13;
Rehabilitation Project towards broader Bank assistance in the transport sector, in particular&#13;
towards facilitating the integration of poor rural communities into the mainstream economy and&#13;
the expansion of markets for agriculture and other non-farm products. The joint IDB-World&#13;
Bank collaboration further strengthens IDB's and the Bank's dialogue with the country and the&#13;
effectiveness of both banks' involvement in the sector.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
2.5   The overall purpose of the proposed project is to provide a well-integrated and reliable&#13;
rural road system through rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads and key links connecting&#13;
to the primary road system. This will help alleviate rural poverty and raise living standards of&#13;
rural communities through increased access to basic social and economic and income-generating&#13;
activities, the goal of the Government's strategy. The specific objectives are to: (a) reduce&#13;
transport costs and raise the reliability of vehicular access to expand markets for agricultural and&#13;
non-farm products; (b) integrate poorly accessible zones with regional economic centers; (c)&#13;
improve transport conditions in rural villages; (d) generate employment through the rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance of rural roads to mitigate rural poverty; and (e) build up institutional capacity at&#13;
local government level and develop small and medium enterprises to manage and carry out, on a&#13;
sustainable basis, the maintenance and upgrading of rural roads.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
2.6   The proposed project is being prepared jointly by Government and IDB and Bank staff.&#13;
The project would support the first phase of the Government's six-year program designed to&#13;
improve transport conditions between rural communities and production and consumption centers&#13;
(see para. 1.31). Government, IDB and the Bank would finance jointly the investments planned&#13;
under the project under the same project conditions.&#13;
2.7   The project emphasizes the connection of the benefited rural communities with a well-&#13;
integrated and reliable road system through rehabilitation and maintenance of a "core" road&#13;
network composed of rural roads and connecting primary and secondary roads. Several&#13;
advantages are foreseen from this strategy. First, it will remove the bottlenecks constraining&#13;
transport services in rural areas, maximize the population benefited, and, overall, have a greater&#13;
social and economic impact than in the case of isolated road improvements. Second, through&#13;
improved road access the project would permit easier coordination among other rural&#13;
development programs. Third, it introduces local governments to the principle of "network"&#13;
management (including the informal network of non-motorized tracks), which is key to improving&#13;
transport services. However, it will take time and substantial efforts in technical assistance for&#13;
this principle to take root among local governments, since this is a major change from the current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
practice where municipalities are mostly limited to occasional road emergency works. Thus,&#13;
while building an intense road investment program, the proposed project also supports a strong&#13;
institutional development component. The program will support MTC's policy to emphasize&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance over new construction.&#13;
2.8   In view of the large size of the program and the history of inactivity in the rural roads&#13;
subsector, MTC is carrying out a Pilot which would be financed retroactively by the project. This&#13;
Pilot has established the technical, administrative, socio-economic and cost information needed to&#13;
design the project (see para. 3.17). Though implementation of the pilot is still underway, the&#13;
experience gained so far has confirmed the validity of the assumptions and data used for project&#13;
design.&#13;
2.9   As presently designed by Government, the rural roads program entails rehabilitating in a&#13;
six-year time frame about 30 percent of the rural road network in 12 departments out of a total of&#13;
24. The proposed project would finance the first phase of the program which includes&#13;
investments started in 1995 in six departments under the Pilot, and investments from 1996 to&#13;
1998 which would progressively expand to cover the total of 12 departments. The second phase&#13;
of the program would be carried out under a follow-up project, to be supported by IDB and Bank&#13;
loans to finance additional investments in the same 12 departments starting in 1999 and on. This&#13;
follow on operation is tentatively planned for approval by end 1998 to ensure the continuity of the&#13;
financial plan. However, the actual scope of this second phase, as well as the amount of the loans&#13;
and appropriate time to process them, would be adjusted based on the performance achieved&#13;
during implementation of the proposed project. The project remains viable even if only the first&#13;
phase of the program is completed. In addition, phasing the financing will facilitate&#13;
accommodating changes in the project environment--i.e., progress in the decentralization&#13;
agenda --, reduce project risks and give more incentives (and leverage to IDB and the Bank) for&#13;
better performance. The decision to start preparation of the follow up operation would be&#13;
undertaken at the project third annual review which constitutes the mid-term review of the&#13;
program (see para.3.31 ).&#13;
2.10  The project would start in the six departments in the sierra region chosen for the Pilot,&#13;
which rank highest in terms of rural poverty, namely Ancash, Apurimac, Ayacucho, Cajamarca,&#13;
Cusco and Huancavelica. In 1997, the project would be expanded to also cover another six&#13;
departments, the next ones in terms of rural poverty: Huanuco, Junin, Pasco, Puno, San Martin&#13;
and Madre de Dios (with start-up of works in the two latter scheduled for 1998). This staged-&#13;
approach will give an opportunity to immediately apply lessons learned from the Pilot and during&#13;
the first year of project implementation to the additional departments incorporated into the&#13;
project. The 12 departments selected, out of a total of 24, account for about 61 percent of the&#13;
rural road network in Peru. They cover most of the sierra region, and some departments, also&#13;
areas of piedmont (Ceja de Selva) where road improvements can support alternative development&#13;
programs in coca producing areas.&#13;
2.11   The strategies used in the definition of the proposed project build directly from the Bank's&#13;
experience in other projects in Per6 (mainly the Social Development and Compensation Fund&#13;
Project), as well as experience in other countries and regions. The rehabilitation of critical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
sections, the promotion of small and medium contractors, and the development of micro-&#13;
enterprises systems for rural road maintenance, were pioneered in other Bank projects in Latin&#13;
America and Africa, and are consistent with the Bank's overall strategy for rural roads. The five&#13;
components of the proposed project are described below. The logical framework of the project as&#13;
well as the program it supports, with key indicators and physical targets by component, is given in&#13;
Annex 3. The performance indicators and physical targets were agreed at negotiations.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Rural Roads&#13;
2.12  This component would finance rehabilitation of about 7,500 km (out of the 12,500 km&#13;
planned under the program) of the rural road network to improve accessibility and help reduce the&#13;
overall deterioration of that network. Though poorly engineered, these one-lane roads have&#13;
geometric standards reasonably adapted to the terrain and the traffic they serve (from a few&#13;
vehicles a day up to 15-20 vehicles on peak market days, mostly micro-buses and 3 tons trucks).&#13;
The proposed works would concentrate on eliminating critical sections and spot improvements to&#13;
ensure adequate transitability and a level of access tailored to the specific transport needs of the&#13;
local communities. Through spot rehabilitation access is substantially improved at a low cost, in&#13;
terms of transport time required and accessibility during the rainy season. This would entail&#13;
correcting the surfaces with limited regraveling to provide a more durable running surface over&#13;
poor soils and on steep gradients, removing landslides, and constructing retaining walls and&#13;
additional drainage and erosion control structures. To obtain long-term benefits, spot&#13;
improvements would be followed by an effective road maintenance program.&#13;
2.13  Because of the simple nature of these rehabilitation works, they can be carried out through&#13;
labor-based methods without compromising quality and cost-effectiveness. Most of the works&#13;
will be contracted out to small local contractors, who will make use of the labor force available&#13;
from the benefited communities. The opening of a regular market for simple mechanized&#13;
rehabilitation works would also assist in strengthening the local construction industry. Other&#13;
works in remote areas or where heavy machinery is not needed, will be handled directly by the&#13;
communities, engaged through ad hoc agreements or conv'tenios. Use of local labor would&#13;
increase farm incomes during periods of reduced agriculture activity, notably between March and&#13;
September in the sierra, which is the dry season when most of the works will be carried out. The&#13;
experience of the on-going pilot program, as well as that of FONCODES, shows that the&#13;
commitment to, and direct participation of the population in these community-based arrangements&#13;
is possible.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Connecting Primary and Secondary Roads&#13;
2.14  This component would finance rehabilitation of primary and secondary roads that are&#13;
directly connected and give access to the feeder r oads systems under rehabilitation. These are&#13;
unpaved roads carrying traffic in the range of 50 to 200 vehicles per day, and that after many&#13;
years without any maintenance are in a deplorable condition. About 2,200 km (out of the 3,200&#13;
km envisaged under the program) of primary and mostly secondary roads will be rehabilitated&#13;
through the project. The: rehabilitation works envisaged for the main roads aim at restoring year-&#13;
round trafficability and will include such works as regraveling, grading, bridge replacing, slope&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
protection and drainage system repairs. Paving, widening or realignment are not envisaged, to&#13;
avoid unnecessary high standards that affect both cost and program output over time. This&#13;
component will be coordinated with works being undertaken by DGC (or its successor) on an&#13;
annual basis. Agreement was reached at negotiations that DGC will furnish to IDB and the Bank&#13;
by July 31 each year, starting in 1996, the rehabilitation and maintenance programs to be&#13;
undertaken with its own resources during the upcoming year.&#13;
Routine Maintenance of Rural Roads&#13;
2.15  This component aims at setting up a routine maintenance system. Innovative cost-&#13;
effective schemes based on contracting out labor-intensive works to micro-enterprises or local&#13;
cooperatives, and equipment-intensive works to small and medium contractors, would be&#13;
introduced. Present capacity of the public sector is limited. Involving communities and&#13;
developing small local contractors would increase capacity and build pressure over local&#13;
governments for continuous road maintenance. The strategy pursued under the project is that the&#13;
rural road network in most of the sierra region first must receive rehabilitation on critical sections&#13;
(spot improvements) before maintenance activities begin. Subsequent routine road maintenance&#13;
would consist of simple works regularly performed throughout the year to maintain the drainage&#13;
systems (ditches, culverts, vegetation) and the running surface (filling potholes and ruts,&#13;
maintaining the surface camber). The project would basically finance routine maintenance of&#13;
those roads rehabilitated through the project, but other roads could be included if local&#13;
governments commit themselves to supporting these activities. Maintenance of roads built or&#13;
rehabilitated by other rural development programs (e.g. FONCODES, INADE) would also be&#13;
eligible for project support, provided they are linked with, or in the vicinities of road sub-projects&#13;
being implemented under the project. This would entail maintaining from about 1,500 km of&#13;
roads at the beginning of the project to about 7,500 km at the project end.&#13;
2.16  The rationale for funding routine maintenance is that little or no maintenance has been&#13;
done in the past. Thus, it becomes necessary to demonstrate the long-term benefits of simple day-&#13;
to-day maintenance through the structured learning exercise that the project would provide. It is&#13;
of the essence that adequate funding be available not only for developing the proposed&#13;
maintenance schemes but also for sustaining their effectiveness through implementation.&#13;
Experience in other countries has shown that despite putting in place favorable co-financing&#13;
arrangements, it is very difficult and demands substantial efforts in technical assistance to mobilize&#13;
local governments to carry out routine maintenance.&#13;
2.17 The IDB and the Bank loans would finance maintenance on a declining basis, while&#13;
Government contribution would increase accordingly throughout project execution. Government&#13;
is reviewing the mechanisms for road funding, including the option of setting a Road Maintenance&#13;
Fund to secure a steady flow of funds for road maintenance at the various levels of administration.&#13;
However, a Fund would finance only a fraction of rural road maintenance costs, requiring&#13;
municipalities to mobilize their own resources to match this contribution, a burden well above&#13;
their current possibilities. A study financed under the project will help define a strategy to address&#13;
this issue (see para. 2.25) within the context of the Government's decentralization agenda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Improvement of Village Streets&#13;
2.18   Villages and small towns with populations up to about 2,000 inhabitants do not classify as&#13;
"urban" and often are neglected in "rural" transport programs. The road infrastructure in such&#13;
villages, despite servicing a high number of beneficiaries, is rarely planned for, and is developed&#13;
many times in an ad-hoc manner. Furthermore, construction of secondary and rural roads that go&#13;
through villages often neglects the impact on village amenities, such as street drainage.&#13;
Investments in village roads and streets have the potential to improve the welfare of village&#13;
residents through better access to village centers of activity (e.g., market, hospital, school,&#13;
cemetery) and improved health as a result of better drainage of runoff from roads and streets.&#13;
2.19  This component would finance street improvements in small rural communities to enhance&#13;
environmental conditions and raise living standards by upgrading or paving the section of the rural&#13;
road crossing a village. It is anticipated that about 220 km of village streets will be improved&#13;
under the six-year program, with the potential to benefit about 300 villages; about 140 km are&#13;
planned for execution under the project. The works will remain simple and appropriate for labor-&#13;
based construction methods, including: i) laying new stone pavements and/or resetting existing&#13;
stone pavements empedrados. Stone quarries are abundant in the sierra region and there is a long&#13;
tradition in the use of these materials that goes back to the early Incas; ii) paving with adoquines&#13;
of interlocking concrete blocks; and iii) paving with concrete slabs. The initial investment cost of&#13;
the two latter options are higher than asphalt surface treatments, but more cost-effective if&#13;
maintenance costs are brought into a life cycle cost analysis, and much less costly in terms of&#13;
foreign exchange.&#13;
2.20   The designs will emphasize improving drainage and safety conditions, and ensuring&#13;
sustainable maintenance. The community's capacity to maintain the improved streets will be a key&#13;
factor for choosing the appropriate technology. The project in general would finance&#13;
empedrados. The terms of reference for preparation of engineering studies require consultants to&#13;
provide detailed justification (and approval by PERT-PCR) for any departure from this standard&#13;
solution. Criteria in this aspect include comparative cost (based on life cycle cost analysis), type&#13;
of service to be provided, prevailing condition of other existing road infrastructure in the village&#13;
and capacity for future maintenance.&#13;
Improvement of Non-Motorized Rural Transport&#13;
2.21   Transport and mobility of goods and people in rural areas relies on the existence of&#13;
adequate infrastructure and on the access to means of transport. Improvement of accessibility and&#13;
mobility of rural areas must also take account of the unclassified network of tracks and footpaths&#13;
that service the transport needs of the rural poorest, and poor women in particular. Mobility&#13;
needs in rural areas are often met by non-motorized transport (NMT) modes, even on classified&#13;
roads. Widespread use of non-motorized vehicles (bicycles, tricycles) and animals is both&#13;
hampered by the poor condition of rural transport infrastructure (compounded with difficult&#13;
terrain conditions), and also by their high acquisition price which is above the cash income earning&#13;
capacity of most households. Field visits undertaken during project preparation showed that poor&#13;
inhabitants of small villages utilize a variety of intermediate- and non-motorized modes. Certain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
remote anexos and caserios are not serviced by the classified rural road network but by tracks and&#13;
paths that connect them to the closest village or municipal district.&#13;
2.22 The non-motorized rural transport component would provide local governments and&#13;
communities with a tool to help them formulate coherent programs for the management and&#13;
maintenance of village level infrastructure and improvement of transport technology. To this end,&#13;
this component will finance (1) technical assistance for village-level infrastructure management,&#13;
and (2) physical works aimed at removing unsafe spots and other bottlenecks constraining the use&#13;
of the intermediate means of transport. The project will not directly address the issue of&#13;
improving affordability to more efficient means of NMT. It is anticipated, however, that the&#13;
project would have positive indirect impact by (1) raising awareness of the importance of&#13;
transport services over the unclassified village network through this component, (2) helping&#13;
design ad-hoc local programs to mobilize additional financial aid for this purpose, and (3)&#13;
generating supplemental income through implementation of the road components. The project&#13;
would finance 80 percent of the total cost estimated by PERT-PCR for the proposed works based&#13;
on standard designs and unit costs. This would fully cover the cost of materials, equipment and&#13;
skilled labor, while most of the unskilled labor would be contributed by the community. Annex 4&#13;
describes in more detail the design and implementation arrangements for this component. The&#13;
community will be determinant in the selection, planning, implementation and financing of the&#13;
proposed works.&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
2.23   This component would consist of: i) technical assistance to improve planning and&#13;
management of rural roads at the national and local levels. This technical assistance will be&#13;
supported by two policy and institutional studies on local road management practices and rural&#13;
road financing; ii) technical assistance to develop micro-enterprises for execution of routine&#13;
maintenance using work methods tailored to the institutional and financial capacity of rural&#13;
municipalities; and iii) a package of technical assistance and training services to strengthen the&#13;
local road construction industry, to be offered on a voluntary basis to local contractors and micro-&#13;
enterprises who will be awarded contracts under the road rehabilitation components, and on-the-&#13;
job training to local engineering firms and beneficiaries on the preparation of feasibility studies and&#13;
technical project proposals. The project would also finance training in Peru and abroad for key&#13;
staff from MTC, PERT-PCR and local governments participating in project activities.&#13;
2.24 Technical Assistance to Improve Planning and Management of Rural Roads. The&#13;
terms of reference for this assignment are given in Annex 5. Recruitment of consultants will start&#13;
prior to loan effectiveness to ensure that the consultant services can be developed from the&#13;
beginning of the project (see para 3.22). The program will be organized into three streams:&#13;
(a)    Technical assistance to strengthen MTC's capacity for formulating and reviewing&#13;
rural roads policy, programming investments in coordination with other Ministries,&#13;
and monitoring compliance with investment programs and performance of the rural&#13;
transport system. Staff within MTC's Planning Office will be trained for this&#13;
purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(b)    Technical advice to PERT-PCR, during project execution. This would include&#13;
reviewing the adequacy of investment programs and quality of studies produced by&#13;
consultants, ensuring consistent application of the Project Operational Manual (see&#13;
para. 3.7), upgrading procedures defined in the Manual based on feedback from&#13;
project implementation (including preparation of an Environmental Manual for&#13;
environmental management of rural roads), assisting PERT-PCR's management in&#13;
evaluating performance of PERT-PCR's deconcentrated units and developing the&#13;
institutional strengthening components; and&#13;
(c)    Technical assistance to municipal provinces and distficts to strengthen their&#13;
capacity to plan and carry out rural roads maintenance. This would be a three-part&#13;
effort. First, exposing municipalities to the organizational shortcuts, the simple&#13;
planning and budgeting systems, and the extensive use of labor-based methods and&#13;
contract arrangements promoted under the project. Second, setting in place a&#13;
simple road performance evaluation system and establishing maintenance capability&#13;
and a coordinated strategy at the provincial level. This strategy should emphasize&#13;
coordination between municipal provinces and their districts, and between districts&#13;
and their villages. Third, fostefing grassroot environmental awareness among rural&#13;
communities and involving road users and other stakeholders in the road&#13;
management process to increase municipalities' accountability. The technical&#13;
assistance will put in place effective local participation mechanisms to improve&#13;
selection and execution of rural road projects and regularly assess progress in&#13;
achieving the project development objectives. Municipalities in the project area&#13;
will be required to participate in the technical assistance program, but the program&#13;
will also be available to other interested municipalities. The program will be&#13;
tailored to the size, structure and complexity of the different municipalities.&#13;
2.25   This package will be complemented by the two studies outlined below, whose final terms&#13;
of reference will be prepared by end-September 1996 to reflect the development of the&#13;
Government's decentralization policy. The design of sustainable mechanisms for the financing of&#13;
rural roads maintenance and the streamlining of road admiinistration practices at the local level, as&#13;
well as appropriate action plans to implement them in reasonable time, are foreseen as key&#13;
outcomes of the project (see Annex 3). These mechanisms and action plans will be thoroughly&#13;
discussed and agreed upon at the third annual review of the project (mid-term program review).&#13;
(a)    Study on Local Road Management Practices. Assessments on the institutional,&#13;
administrative and financial capacity of local governments undertaken as part of&#13;
project preparation have shown that cumbersome regulations and procedures used&#13;
for budgeting, procurement and administration of road works, and excessive&#13;
reliance on inefficient force account arrangements, constitute bottlenecks that&#13;
coupled with a weak financial base, seriously inhibit the capacity of local&#13;
governments to manage their rural roads networks in an efficient manner. The&#13;
proposed study would examine existing procurement legislation and practices to&#13;
uncover bottlenecks impeding project implementation and design system&#13;
improvements. It will also look at possible shortfalls constraining further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
development of the local construction industry, as needed to shift to a policy of&#13;
increased usage of private contractors. This would include factors such as&#13;
affordability of, and access to bank credit to finance equipment, and working&#13;
capital, legal and registration requirements, policy and employment conditions&#13;
which may influence a choice against labor-intensive methods, as well as the need&#13;
for further government support for promoting plant pools for equipment rental.&#13;
(b)   Study on Rural Road Financing. With support from IDB's Highways I project&#13;
(Loan 65 I-OC-PE), MTC has undertaken a study to analyze and propose&#13;
financing mechanisms to assure the adequate flow of funds for maintenance of the&#13;
national road network. The rural road network, by its own physical and traffic&#13;
characteristics requires a different perspective towards securing and channeling the&#13;
necessary maintenance funds. In any municipality rural road maintenance is but&#13;
one service among many competing for scarce resources (and likely less visible&#13;
than others). There are no ready made solutions to the central problem of&#13;
mobilizing local resources for maintenance of rural roads. Early involvement of&#13;
local government in planning seems to be beneficial in building up awareness, but&#13;
in the long term they must have some reliable means to raise funds themselves for&#13;
this purpose. The project would finance a study to analyze this issue. The study&#13;
would include an estimate of the maintenance needs for the rural road network and&#13;
the institutional mechanisms to meet those needs, including funding&#13;
responsibilities, by looking at a representative sample of district and provincial&#13;
municipalities and proposing practical and feasible ways of raising maintenance&#13;
revenues from the beneficiaries of the road infrastructure. The study would&#13;
conclude with specific recommendations regarding (1) the extent of financial&#13;
participation of higher levels of government; (2) the revenue-raising prospects and&#13;
mechanisms at the local level (municipalities and users) for rural road expenditures;&#13;
and (3) a feasible structure of revenues for road maintenance that would observe a&#13;
close relationship with road usage.&#13;
2.26  Technical Assistance to Develop micro-enterprises formed by groups of beneficiaries&#13;
for road maintenance. The difficulties of ensuring central-government maintenance of a myriad&#13;
of scattered rural roads, and the failure of traditional municipal force account works, suggest&#13;
private-sector involvement in the form of municipal contracts with small local engineering firms&#13;
and road maintenance micro-enterprises. The proposed component contemplates developing&#13;
micro-enterprises to undertake routine and emergency maintenance of rural roads (with possibly&#13;
larger firms supplying specialized equipment and know-how for more complex works). This&#13;
approach has been successfully introduced in Peru for some urban services (e.g., waste collection)&#13;
and specifically for road maintenance in Colombia. In addition, the use of micro-enterprises has&#13;
some comparative advantages for further developing rural areas: they may act as catalysts for&#13;
other local development initiatives, become contact points for extension services, and even&#13;
mobilize untapped local resources for local community ventures. This in turn may encourage&#13;
local governments to utilize the micro-enterprises. The technical assistance will guide the&#13;
transition towards locally supported use of the maintenance schemes developed under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
2.27  Typically, microenterprises will be made up of 8 to 14 people living close to the road, to&#13;
carry out manual routine maintenance activities on approximately 15 to 50 km. The project&#13;
would finance all activities related to (1) promoting the development of microenterprises among&#13;
leaders of the communities and base organizations, (2) assisting microenterprises throughout their&#13;
constitution, including legal and technical advice, (3) contracting out maintenance of more than&#13;
10,000 km to micro-enterprises, (4) putting in place adequate contract arrangements and payment&#13;
systems, (5) providing supervision and monitoring to ensure smooth implementation of the&#13;
program, and (6) supporting a dissemination campaign among local governments to sensitize them&#13;
about the benefits of the micro-enterprise program. Preparation of this component builds on the&#13;
recommendations of the Pilot Maintenance Study undertaken with support of the on-going&#13;
Transport Rehabilitation Project (Ln. 3717-PE). MTC through PERT-PCR will recruit&#13;
consultants for developing the first group of microenterprises by March 31, 1996 under the terms&#13;
of reference shown in Annex 5.&#13;
2.28  Technical Assistance and Training Services to Strengthen the Local Road&#13;
Construction Industry. This technical assistance package will aim at increasing the technical&#13;
and managerial capacity of small- and medium-scale local firms engaged in road construction and&#13;
maintenance. The rationale behind this component is that most firms in the target group are&#13;
expected to show weaknesses, in terms of management, work organization, and technical skills,&#13;
which might jeopardize the successful implementation of the sub-projects that they will be&#13;
commissioned to carry out. The provision of some technical assistance to contractors is deemed&#13;
an effective way of addressing this risk and provide a basis for long-term development of the local&#13;
construction industry. MTC through PERT-PCR will submit to IDB and the Bank the assistance&#13;
program, outlining the training services that will be offered as well as the strategies for their&#13;
delivery, proposed for the upcoming year, not later than July 31 each year, starting in 1996.&#13;
2.29  Three subprograms will be offered under this component, namely (1) a business&#13;
adrninistration and financial management program intended for entrepreneurs and their&#13;
administrative staff, (2) a work organization program primarily designed for foremen, and (3)&#13;
various technical training courses to improve the skills of basic workers. These subprograms&#13;
would have a practical orientation and take the form of on-the-job assistance training. Potential&#13;
beneficiaries will be free to accept or refuse this form of assistance, except in cases where&#13;
technical assistance is deemed indispensable for successful implementation of the sub-project and&#13;
therefore a condition for contract award.&#13;
2.30  This technical assistance component also includes support to local consultants to prepare&#13;
feasibility studies and technical project proposals that would be submitted to PERT-PCR for&#13;
funding. Training courses will be provided to ensure that the terms of reference and&#13;
methodologies developed for the project are well understood and correctly applied. Perhaps more&#13;
importantly, local consultants will be exposed to on-the-job training during the formal review and&#13;
approval of the studies submitted to PERT-PCR for financing under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
E. Environmental Assessment&#13;
2.31   The project has been rated "B", as no major environmental issues are foreseen. The&#13;
project supports rehabilitation and maintenance of existing unpaved rural and departmental roads.&#13;
Since these are in general existing roads, the risk of additional indirect negative impact linked with&#13;
human activities (i.e., colonization, deforestation) is limited and the proposed project activities are&#13;
unlikely to harm the ecological and social environment. The greatest environmental damages&#13;
associated with the existing targeted road network is erosion and flooding of farmlands and road&#13;
surfaces. By its very nature, the spot rehabilitation and maintenance strategy adopted has positive&#13;
impacts on the environment because of its strong focus on identifying and offsetting erosion&#13;
problems. Annex 6 presents an overall environmental assessment of the project works and&#13;
provisions included in the project to build environmental management capacity. Nevertheless,&#13;
performance audits (see para. 3.29 ) will include an assessment on the compliance with the&#13;
environmental guidelines agreed under the project.&#13;
2.32  Furthermore, the project would assist MTC and local governments in developing and&#13;
implementing a sound strategy for environmental management of rural road projects. The Project&#13;
Operational Manual will set environmental guidelines to adequately address the following issues:&#13;
i) procedures for environmental screening of projects at their preliminary identification. Simple&#13;
but effective guidelines will help assess potential risks and categorize the projects on account of&#13;
the actions recommended; ii) guidelines for identification of environmental damages and design of&#13;
corrective or mitigation measures, with emphasis on preparation of Environmental Management&#13;
Plans; iii) technical specifications for work execution, with clear provisions to ensure that work&#13;
methods are environmentally sound. These procedures will also be consolidated in an&#13;
Environmental Manual for rural roads to facilitate their application by local and regional entities&#13;
under and beyond the implementation of the project.&#13;
2.33   As noted in para. 2.24, the technical assistance program includes actions to institutionalize&#13;
these environmental practices. The Government's capacity to address environmental issues&#13;
related to road and transport services is weak. The overall responsibility for environmental&#13;
management in the transport sector rests with MTC. An Environmental Unit has been established&#13;
within MTC and technical assistance is being provided under the on-going Transport&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (Ln. 3717-PE). Through the technical assistance component, further&#13;
attention is given under the proposed project to foster (1) grassroot environmental awareness&#13;
among rural communities, (2) environmental planning and preparation of mitigation plans, and (3)&#13;
inter-institutional arrangements for implementation of environmental management plans.&#13;
F. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
2.34  Project Costs. The total project cost is estimated at US$250 million, with a foreign&#13;
exchange component of about US$83 million (33 percent). Base costs are in January 1995 prices.&#13;
Physical contingencies were calculated at 10 percent of base costs. Price contingencies were&#13;
calculated at an annual rate of 2.7 percent. This escalation rate was applied to both local and&#13;
international prices, which implies that the exchange rate is periodically adjusted to reflect the&#13;
difference between internal inflation and the evolution of world prices. Project costs are shown in&#13;
the attached summary, altogether with the costs estimated for the second phase of the program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(1999-2000) and the totals for the entire six-year program (1995-2000). Annex 7 details the cost&#13;
estimates on a year-by-year basis.&#13;
2.35   The costs of civil works are based on work quantities determined from field surveys and&#13;
engineering designs prepared by local consultants for the Pilot (see para. 3.17), entailing about&#13;
1,506 km of roads. The unit prices used in the project are slightly higher than those calculated by&#13;
the consultants and obtained from bids already received under the Pilot, in anticipation of a&#13;
possible increase of unit costs with the acceleration of construction activity in the project area.&#13;
2.36 Project Financing. The proposed Bank loan of US$90 million would finance about 36&#13;
percent of the total cost of the project. IDB would provide joint cofinancing through a loan of&#13;
US$90 million. Together, the two loans would cover all foreign costs and about 58 percent of&#13;
local costs. The loans will be made to the Republic of Perui. Government requested this joint&#13;
financing as opposed to parallel cofinancing to simplify project administration. This is feasible in&#13;
view that (1) both Banks are financing the same components under the same implementation&#13;
arrangements, and (2) no international procurement is envisaged as the small size of the contracts&#13;
is unlikely to attract contractors from outside the region. Government will provide about&#13;
US$70.3 million for Phase I of project implementation, of which about US$38.2 million are taxes.&#13;
A summary of the financial plan is attached below. A detail financial plan by component, covering&#13;
the proposed project (or phase I) and phase II of the program, is given in Annex 7.&#13;
G. Project Benefits&#13;
Intended Benericiaries&#13;
2.37  The project's intended beneficiaries are divided into three groups. First, there is the&#13;
population at large benefiting from better access in rural areas. In particular this will benefit the&#13;
poorest rural communities located in the sierra region, since sub-project selection criteria give&#13;
priority to these areas. The potential number of beneficiaries is the 2.7 million rural population&#13;
living in the first six departments targeted under the project. Further expansion of the project to&#13;
include a total of 12 departments will benefit an additional potential 1.8 million rural population.&#13;
All in all, this represents about 70 percent of the rural population of Peru and about 20 percent of&#13;
the total. In these rural communities women constitute a major beneficiary group for road and&#13;
track improvements. They are the largest group involved in taking products to the markets and&#13;
improved road reliability should increase their income earning capacity. Better access to social&#13;
services, such as hospitals and schools, would offer greater proportionate benefit to women.&#13;
Scope for involvement of women directly in road work activities is yet to be assessed.&#13;
2.38   Second, there are the small enterprises and community groups that will be formed or&#13;
strengthened as a result of their involvement in the execution of the works financed by the project.&#13;
This will improve the individual skills of the workers who will be employed, and the corporate&#13;
competitiveness of the small firms that will carry out the works so as to develop their capacity to&#13;
respond to increased opportunities for sustained employment after project completion. Since&#13;
most of the contractors have been working on sporadic informal basis, the project will contribute&#13;
to helping them achieve a transition from the informal to the formal sector. The project also&#13;

benefits local consultants and NGOs that will be engaged in the preparation of engineering designs&#13;
and supervision of works, providing expanded opportunities for their development under practices&#13;
that provide the necessary motivation for quality and efficiency. Access to opportunities will&#13;
break the conundrum of "no work-no experience-no qualification".&#13;
2.39   A third group of beneficiaries is constituted by a large number of municipalities that will&#13;
benefit from investment and institutional strengthening from the project. The 71 provincial&#13;
municipalities in the initial six departments are targeted under the project. This number could&#13;
increase to about 100 provincial municipalities, out of a total of 176 in the country as a whole,&#13;
once the project is expanded to cover 12 departments. However, other municipalities are&#13;
potential beneficiaries should they have interest in participating in the technical assistance&#13;
component of the project.&#13;
Economic Justification&#13;
2.40   Eligibility criteria were used early in the project preparation stage to screen investments&#13;
and identify rural roads selected for rehabilitation under the pilot and first-year programs of the&#13;
project. These programs include roads which were selected on the basis of geographic&#13;
(provincial) poverty indicators (infant mortality rates and unsatisfied basic needs). Thirty two&#13;
provinces, located in the six poorest departments, were targeted for intervention within the pilot&#13;
and first-year programs. The economic analyses (that take into consideration the expected&#13;
agricultural and livestock production) of 76% of the kilometers of the pilot yielded a net present&#13;
value of around US$25 million and a combined economic rate of return of 44.1%. No costs or&#13;
benefits have been quantified for the village-level investments and non-motorized improvements&#13;
(about 13 percent of the cost of physical investments), and institutional development, training and&#13;
technical assistance activities representing about 15 percent of the total base cost. Annex  11&#13;
details the methodology and results of the economic analysis.&#13;
2.41   For the second- to fifth-year programs, the eligibility criteria include institutional,&#13;
technical, environmental, social and economic factors whose application would follow a&#13;
structured process that would permit screening the level of social purpose of a particular project&#13;
and the prospects for its sustainability (see para 3.12). The Project Operational Manual would&#13;
detail the definition of the four eligibility criteria in order to ensure the application of uniform&#13;
yardsticks to the approval of projects across the different provinces. Their application, with the&#13;
assistance of a consultant firm (see para. 2.24), will help single out road projects with, first, a&#13;
strong social purpose and the adequate technical and environmental specifications and institutional&#13;
capacity and, second, for those of a larger scale (in terms of total cost and cost per kilometer), a&#13;
proven economic worthiness to the potential increase in the agricultural development of their area&#13;
of influence. At project negotiations, assurances were given that all sub-projects considered for&#13;
financing under the project will comply with the specified eligibility criteria, as defined in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Organization and Management&#13;
3.1    Operational Set-up. MTC will have overall responsibility for project coordination and&#13;
implementation. MTC lacks the capacity to directly manage a large rural roads project, and it&#13;
would involve a costly and lengthy process to rebuild the capacity. Actual implementation will be&#13;
delegated to a specialized unit, the Proyecto Especial de Rehabilitaci6n del Transporte -&#13;
Programa de Caminos Rurales (PERT-PCR), which was created in July 1995 by Ministerial&#13;
decree. With staff and budget separated from the rest of the Ministry, the unit enjoys ample&#13;
technical, administrative and financial autonomy. Its limited personnel is engaged at private-&#13;
sector salaries and paid from local counterpart funds. Most of the tasks will be undertaken by&#13;
consultants engaged under the project. The unit is led by an Executive Director who reports&#13;
directly to the Vice-Minister of Transport. Implementing the project within the proposed time&#13;
frame will demand strong skills to manage hundreds of road links spread over difficult remote&#13;
rural areas. This will require setting deconcentrated units in those departments with active&#13;
programs to manage the works, a strategy that is consistent with Government's agenda for&#13;
decentralization. The Operational Plan for the final establishment of PERT-PCR and its initial&#13;
deconcentrated units is shown in Annex 8. Due to the special nature of the statutes of PERT-&#13;
PCR, its duration is initially limited to the execution of the proposed project. At the third annual&#13;
review, Government jointly with IDB and the Bank will review the need to continue with PERT-&#13;
PCR after project completion, taking account of the progress made in the decentralization agenda.&#13;
3.2   The project operational set-up would have a three-layer organization that would attempt&#13;
to efficiently achieve an adequate monitoring of project execution, the decentralization of&#13;
responsibilities, and the participation of municipalities and communities, as follows (Chart 1):&#13;
(a)   PERT-PCR's central unit in Lima would be responsible for general project&#13;
management. This would entail (1) establishing indicative budgetary allocations&#13;
and investment programs, (2) designing and coordinating the institutional&#13;
strengthening component, (3) issuing implementation guidelines (through the&#13;
Operational Manual and further reviews of it), (4) channeling project funds to the&#13;
deconcentrated units, (5) putting in place and upkeeping the project ex-post&#13;
monitoring system, (6) auditing performance of deconcentrated units (para.3.29),&#13;
and (7) preparing progress reports, processing disbursement requests, and&#13;
managing the Special Account (para.3.46).&#13;
(b)   The deconcentrated executing units (UEDs) of the PERT-PCR, located in the&#13;
project areas (likely one per department or region participating in the project),&#13;
would be responsible for managing the work programs. This would entail (1)&#13;
promoting the project among, and entering into agreements (convenios) with&#13;
municipalities and communities, (2) coordinating with other decentralized agencies&#13;
their rural development and poverty alleviation programs, (3) defining and&#13;
programming investments in consultation with the municipalities, (4) engaging&#13;
consultants and NGOs for engineering studies, supervision of works and delivery&#13;
of institutional components, (5) tendering contracts for works, (6) administering&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
contracts and convenios (including payments), and (7) monitoring and reporting&#13;
implementation of the various project components.&#13;
(c)   Municipalities and communities at the local level. Though the project funds will&#13;
not be channeled to the municipalities, municipalities would participate in (1)&#13;
identifying sub-projects and coordinating with UEDs the investment programs, (2)&#13;
contributing to the cost of the works for community-managed components and&#13;
directly executing small works through convenios; (3) undertaking the institutional&#13;
action programs agreed under the project; and (4) overseeing through Road&#13;
Committees the delivery of programs and reporting any difficulties in the&#13;
implementation of the project.&#13;
3.3   Each UED will be established according to one of the following three possible options:&#13;
(1) contracting out management services to a private firm, (2) establishing an ad-hoc unit with&#13;
staff appointed by PERT-PCR, and (3) delegating the management functions to an existing&#13;
decentralized or local government agency restructured to meet the project requirements. It is&#13;
envisaged that nine units will be needed to efficiently manage the work programs in the 12&#13;
departments selected under the project. The location and phasing in the creation of these units&#13;
have been determined taking into account (1) the volume of work in each department or&#13;
geographic area, (2) potential gains to be realized through the proposed location, in terms of&#13;
improved accessibility to work sites (some rural areas are better reached from contiguous&#13;
departments rather than from their own department) and to the existing market of local&#13;
contractors and consultants, and (3) institutional and operational capacity available locally. The&#13;
size of the UJEDs will vary in line with the volume and nature of the work planned, but in general&#13;
will consist of 6 to 8 staff organized in three areas: (1) project development (planning, promotion&#13;
of subprojects and institutional building, (2) engineering (review of studies, procurement and&#13;
contract supervision), and (3) accounting and administration. The managers of the UEDs will&#13;
report directly to the Executive Director of PERT-PCR.&#13;
3.4   MTC through PERT-PCR will enter into inter-administrative 'participation agreements'&#13;
with municipalities with jurisdiction over project areas (though the agreements will generally be&#13;
structured on the basis of provinces, all districts within the province will be required to sign in).&#13;
The agreements, whose key features are described in Annex 8, will most notably spell out future&#13;
obligations and undertakings assumed by both parties with regard to the execution of the project.&#13;
The project will avoid further investments in those provinces where compliance with the&#13;
agreements and the institutional action programs has not been satisfactory. Also, with assistance&#13;
from PERT-PCR, provincial municipalities are expected to prepare, in consultation with their&#13;
districts, transport plans documenting the actions agreed to improve transport conditions in their&#13;
jurisdiction, as required under the Municipal Law.&#13;
3.5   Coordination with other development initiatives. At the central level, MTC will be&#13;
responsible for coordinating with MEF and the Ministries of Presidency (FONCODES, INADE)&#13;
and Agriculture all aspects regarding the Government's poverty alleviation strategy and the&#13;
allocation of funds to other programs to support it. MTC has initiated preliminary 'cooperation&#13;
agreements' with FONCODES and INADE, which control the largest rural infrastructure&#13;
programs, to define mechanisms for sharing socio-economic and sub-project generation data, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
coordinating implementation of investment programs within common targeted areas. Key&#13;
features of these agreements are shown in Annex 8. In addition, staff within MTC's Planning&#13;
Office will be trained as part of the project to strengthen the Office's capacity to set rural roads&#13;
policy, coordinate investments with other agencies who have developed rural development&#13;
projects, and monitor investments and transport performance on a continuous basis.&#13;

3.6      To ensure the coordination of efforts with other governmental programs in specific&#13;
regions or departments, the UJEDs would promote the establishment of regional inter-institutional&#13;
committees that would be responsible for further promoting the project, reviewing the list of&#13;
proposed subprojects, and providing information about other programs/projects in the vicinities of&#13;
the proposed subprojects. The inter-institutional committees would include representatives from&#13;
the communities (including women groups) in the vicinities of the projects being considered for&#13;
analysis. These conmmittees should meet as a minimum once a month and though they would not&#13;
&#13;

Box 6 Content of the Project Operational Manual&#13;
Indicatively, the manual would include:&#13;
*  descnption of background, objectives, and components of the project;&#13;
.  institutional framework and responsibilities: of the PERT-PCR and the UEDs, including the list of indiaors to&#13;
assess the performance of each unit and the methodology for calculating these indicators on a:six-month basis,&#13;
procedures for project administration and flow of funds;&#13;
*  minimum qualifications and regulation for the employment of staff, and restrictions that would apply to thea&#13;
staff to avoid conflict of interest;&#13;
*  procedures for the generation, selection (eligibility criteria), and approval of project proposals;&#13;
*  environmental guidelines to be followed in the execution of project works and to mitigate any adverse impacts&#13;
which may be generated by the rehabilitation of rural roads;&#13;
*  procurement procedures for works and consultant services, including guidelines for the pre-qualification of&#13;
firns, evaluation of proposals/bids, and awarding of contracts; and&#13;
*  obligations of the PERT-PCR and UEDs in implementation and monitoring, including the update of the.&#13;
database information system and the upkeep of accounting and disbursement records.&#13;
*  a set of model documents for items such as (I) agreements (convenios) with local institutions; (2) road.&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance standards, including technical specifications for both traditional and labor-&#13;
based methods of construction; (3) terms of reference for preparation of sub-project eligibihty and engineening&#13;
studies, and supervision works; (4) standard bidding documents and contracts for works; (5) letters of.&#13;
invitation, and contracts for consultant services; (6) terms of reference for performance audits; and (7) format&#13;
and content of database information system.&#13;
have any approval responsibility (which is fully vested upon the chief of the respective UEDs),&#13;
they would have the strong possibility of informing the UEDs of the advantages and&#13;
disadvantages of undertaking particular sub-projects and of carrying particular actions (such as&#13;
methods of construction, procurement, micro-enterprise development). A detailed list of current&#13;
rural development programs that need to be coordinated at the local level is given in Annex 8.&#13;
3.7    The Project Operational Manual. In order to ensure consistency in the implementation&#13;
of the project's various components across departments, PERT-PCR will use a Project&#13;
Operational Manual that will clearly define the guidelines and procedures to be followed by the&#13;
IJEDs when discharging their responsibilities in the execution of the project. MTC assisted by&#13;
consultants is finalizing the manual. The format and content of the manual was agreed at&#13;
negotiations (see Box 6 and Annex 9), and its adoption by PERT-PCR is a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness. Adherence to the manual will be assessed every six months by external auditors&#13;
engaged for the performance audit of PERT-PCR and its UIEDs.&#13;
B. Selection and Programming of Investments&#13;
3.8    Participatory Process in Sub-project Generation. To achieve the intended objectives&#13;
of alleviating poverty and building up local institutional capacity for sustainable maintenance, the&#13;
project makes the beneficiaries participate in the various phases of subproject generation, design,&#13;
implementation and maintenance. While the whole project design is built on this participatory&#13;
approach, it relies on the systematic use of participatory workshops especially designed to ensure&#13;
that community participation is undertaken in a systematic and organized manner. Specific&#13;
objectives of these workshops are to: i) assess transport needs at the community level, ensuring&#13;
that the needs of the rural poor are taken into account; ii) confirm with the beneficiaries the&#13;
priority of the proposed road rehabilitation subprojects and the commitment of the conmmunity to&#13;
their maintenance; iii) validate the design of the selected subprojects to include local solutions; iv)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
mobilize support for road maintenance through increasing ownership of the project and promoting&#13;
micro-enterprises formation; and v) provide local communities with necessary information about&#13;
the project and their role in the project.&#13;
3.9    As described in Box 7, several exercises were undertaken during project preparation to&#13;
develop the participatory mechanisms that would be applied throughout project implementation to&#13;
achieve the above mentioned objectives. These exercises confirmed the potential benefits and&#13;
viability of the participatory approach proposed under the project. Some adjustments to the initial&#13;
methodology proposed were introduced on the basis of the experience gained in the field. A full&#13;
description of the Participatory Process is given in Annex 10. Also included in the Annex are the&#13;
Operational Guidelines developed in the field in conjunction with PERT-PCR for application of&#13;
the participatory process and organization of workshops with beneficiary communities and&#13;
municipalities. The Guidelines are intended for use by local consultants, municipalities and&#13;
PERT-PCR staff in applying participatory mechanisms during project development and&#13;
implementation. Their use throughout project implementation will also expose municipalities to&#13;
participatory approaches and provide on-the-job training to community leaders and local&#13;
authorities involved.&#13;
Box 7 : The Participatory Approach during project preparation&#13;
*  Rationale. The Peruvian government is implementing general policies aimed at integrating the rural poor into&#13;
the mainstream of national economy and culture. In the rural roads sector, regardless of how well constructed&#13;
or rehabilitated roads are, without maintenance the trafficability of roads is compromised, and with it, a wide&#13;
array of services that directly impact in the livelihood of towns and villages. If changes of community&#13;
attitudes towards maintenance are necessary, then the people whose behavior has to change must see their own&#13;
interests linked with the change and commit themselves to it. The value of community participation in&#13;
ensuring the sustainability of projects is well documented.&#13;
*  Objectives. Validation of a participatory approach during project preparation. At project appraisal special&#13;
emphasis was given to developing a proven methodology that could be replicated by local facilitator teams&#13;
from MWC for enhancing commnunity participation in project implementation.&#13;
*  Approach taken Villages were selected for methodology testing and evaluation contingent upon poverty&#13;
evaluation, by which only extremely poor communities in isolated regions were included. The approach was&#13;
implemented at two levels. At the first level, the Community Participatory Workshops were held with&#13;
community leaders (alcaldes, gobernadores and such) and heads of base organizations that are representatives&#13;
of the intended beneficiaries, or heads of NGOs working with the poor in a similar way to the government&#13;
body, FONCODES. These meetings in the cities of Cusco and Huancavelica lasted 5 to 6 hours. At the&#13;
second level, the Community Participatory Workshops were designed around a broad open invitation to whole&#13;
communities, to gather in one-day meetings. This participatory design was applied to two rural communities,&#13;
one was Ccorca, in the Cusco Department and the second was Izcuchaca, in the Huancavelica Department.&#13;
Communities within walking distance were also included.&#13;
*  Selection ofstakeholders. Mayors (alcaldes) were the first resource used in selecting leaders from the rural&#13;
communities and gave detailed information about the basic structure of the community and its organizations.&#13;
Spontaneous mobilization happened: when local leaders knew about the meetings, they invited thernselves.&#13;
One group attended the Cusco meeting after hearing about it by the local radio news. Among those leaders,&#13;
representatives of women's groups like the Mother's Clubs were very important to provide a description of&#13;
social needs (education; health-care) related to road rehabilitation and maintenance. Also, in the case of the&#13;
Huancavelica meeting, they provided community women's view concerning their readiness for future road&#13;
maintenance works.&#13;
*  Conclusions. Community participatory workshops are a powerfiu way for mobilizing public involvement and&#13;
a sense of ownership of a development project. The role of the RRPM project concerning poverty alleviation&#13;
is more than a purpose declaration: it now becomes a shared objective that connects international funding&#13;
institutions, the government of Per&amp; and the high sierra comuneros.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
3.10   Subprojects of the pilot and first-year programs were selected on the basis of poverty&#13;
criteria among candidate roads located in the poorest provinces of the six poorest departments,&#13;
after consultation with local authorities. Subsequent subprojects would be identified on the basis&#13;
of the requests of communities, municipalities, and other public and non-governmental entities&#13;
submitted to PERT-PCR and, in particular, its UEDs. The UEDs are charged with promoting and&#13;
preparing subprojects using the participatory mechanisms described in Annex 10; they would&#13;
disseminate the objectives and components of the project through municipalities and local NGOs&#13;
and a radio campaign. The UEDs would organize participatory workshops with the various&#13;
communities involved, to finalize the identification of the main characteristics and components of&#13;
the requested subprojects. Local consultants will then be engaged to collect the information&#13;
necessary for assessing the eligibility of the requested subprojects and defining their technical&#13;
specifications. Upon approval of a subproject, the pertinent works would be procured with the&#13;
contracting of local construction companies or organized communities (particularly for smaller&#13;
scale maintenance works) under the rules specified in the Project Operational Manual (para.3.7).&#13;
3.11   Eligibility Criteria. In Peru, with two thirds of the rural population being poor or&#13;
extremely poor, investments in rural roads have a strong social policy purpose. Accordingly, the&#13;
Project emphasizes social factors for those project with costs below certain thresholds--in terms&#13;
of both total value and cost per kilometer. For investments with costs above those thresholds,&#13;
their economic worth would be evaluated on the basis of expected agricultural yields and&#13;
livestock production. The eligibility methodology of the Project Operational Manual (detailed in&#13;
Annex I 1) requires to assess the institutional and technical factors (including the sustainability of&#13;
the investments and their possible environmental impacts) of a proposed project as well as both&#13;
the social and agricultural-production feasibility. Non-quantified project benefits include&#13;
increased access to health and education services, accident reduction, and improved institutional&#13;
capacities at the local level. Non-quantified costs include the possible adverse environmental&#13;
impact of the execution of particular road works--for which mitigation measures and&#13;
methodologies are included for their application in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
3.12   Four criteria constitute the vertebras for the eligibility assessment of projects. The&#13;
institutional criteria refer to the level of identification the communities in the area of influence&#13;
would have with a particular road project, including the degree of commitment to the future&#13;
maintenance of those roads. This commitment takes place initially as part of the effort of the&#13;
community in requesting a sub-project or participating in its preparation and design, and second&#13;
by assessing the level of (a) priority of the sub-project as expressed by the communities through&#13;
the participatory workshops; (b) coordination with other rural programs in the area of influence of&#13;
the project; and (c) capacity for organizing the future maintenance of the rehabilitated project,&#13;
including the formation of micro-enterprises.&#13;
3.13   The technical criteria refer to the construction characteristics of the proposed sub-&#13;
projects, the soundness of their environmental mitigation measures, and their functionality within&#13;
the road network in the pertinent province or department. The construction (or technological)&#13;
characteristics aim at implementing works that (a) can be adequately maintained; (b) can maximize&#13;
the use of local labor; (c) their costs keep relation with the expected benefits of the road, and (d)&#13;
do not cause or adequately minimize environmental impacts. Furthermore, the proposed sub-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
projects would be analyzed within the context of the broader transport network and, in particular,&#13;
of the connection of the road to market and/or production centers of the province or department,&#13;
with the objective of defining connected "trees" of rural roads and, when necessary, of&#13;
departmental roads that would ultimately maximize the economic and transport benefits of the&#13;
investments. Both the institutional and technical criteria are of a narrative nature, and the results&#13;
of the evaluation would be documented by the pertinent analyst.&#13;
3.14  The social criteria, based on two readily-available poverty indicators (infant mortality rate&#13;
and unsatisfied basic needs) would be applied when the total cost and the cost per kilometer of a&#13;
sub-project fall under US$200,000 and US$8,500, respectively. Under these circumstances, a&#13;
sub-project would become eligible if the infant mortality rate is higher than 80 and the indicator&#13;
for the unsatisfied basic needs is higher than 70 percent (as described and documented by the&#13;
1993 Census of Population). Furthermore, to ensure the sub-project benefits a reasonable number&#13;
of people, it will also be required than the number of beneficiaries per kilometer is higher than&#13;
100. The thresholds for these indicators have been determined on the basis ofthe analysis ofthe&#13;
pilot sub-projects.&#13;
3.15   When a project surpasses the cost threshold for the solely application of the social criteria&#13;
or when it does not comply with these criteria, it would be subjected to economic criteria&#13;
whereby the rehabilitation and maintenance costs of the sub-project would be compared to the&#13;
benefits it would bring about in terms of the increase of the net agricultural and livestock&#13;
production (net of the local consumption and of production costs) in the area of influence of the&#13;
sub-project, without causing environmental encroachment into natural forests or protected areas.&#13;
On the basis of this information, the internal economic rate of return (IERR) of the sub-project&#13;
would be calculated and when the IERR is higher than 10% the project would become eligible.&#13;
The 10% benchmark has been selected considering that, first, the projects have a strong social&#13;
focus and, second, not all the benefits would be quantified (for instance, to simplify the economic&#13;
analysis, calculations would be performed on the production possibilities of the five major&#13;
agricultural, livestock products or other by-products in the area, leaving out a few others that may&#13;
also contribute to the benefits of the project).&#13;
3.16   The above-mentioned eligibility criteria should generate a program of projects that is&#13;
evenly distributed among the different departments of Peru and among the various project&#13;
components (e.g., between investments on village streets and on the rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of rural roads). To avert a skewed distribution at project completion, at each annual&#13;
review, an examination of the distribution would be performed and the necessary adjustments&#13;
would be incorporated to both the participatory process of project generation and the eligibility&#13;
methodology.&#13;
C. Implementation Strategy&#13;
3.17  The Pilot Program. In view of the large size of the project and the history of inactivity in&#13;
the rural road sector, Government decided to undertake a pilot prior to implementing the project.&#13;
The main objective of the pilot was to establish the basic technical, administrative, socio-&#13;
economic and cost information necessary to design the project (see Box 8). The 'Pilot Program'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Box 8: Objectives of the Pilot&#13;
Obtain information and generate experience about:-&#13;
*  the availabilit and capacity of local consultants (who reside in the project areas) to undertake the studies,;&#13;
adequacy of the terms of reference and the costs, quality and consistency of the studies;&#13;
* the nature of the works recommended, including their costs, duration and scheduling;&#13;
X  the capacity of the local contractors (who reside in the project areas) to undertake the works;&#13;
*  the socio-economic parameters in the project areas and the means of obtaining them;&#13;
recommended methods for the execution of the works, including specific proposals for the use of labor-&#13;
intensive methodologies;&#13;
* the distribution of the needs and works among road networks in order to adequately dimension the project.&#13;
encompasses about 1,485 km of road rehabilitation and 21 km of paving of village streets, with an&#13;
estimated cost of US$33.1 million. These works are located in 19 provinces within six&#13;
departments of Perui ranking highest in terms of poverty (Ancash, Apurimac, Ayacucho,&#13;
Cajamarca, Cusco, Huancavelica). One university and 21 local consultants were engaged to&#13;
collect socio-economic data and prepare the engineering designs for the roads. The studies&#13;
showed that the average number of direct beneficiaries is about 210 per km of road. The designs&#13;
are consistent with the spot improvement guidelines discussed in para. 2.12. The works are&#13;
limited to those necessary to reestablish trafficability and are suitable for labor-intensive&#13;
construction methods. The average estimated cost for rehabilitation of rural roads is slightly less&#13;
than US$10,000 per km; higher costs are associated with road sections with major landslides.&#13;
Cost estimates for improving village streets average about US$140,000 per km (these subprojects&#13;
rarely exceed 0.8 km in length), ranging from about US$58,100 (simple empedrados) to about&#13;
US$230,000 in one case (concrete pavements involving major additional works in drainage and&#13;
sidewalks). The works are being contracted out to small contractors. Contract amounts are&#13;
below US$250,000 and provide for the rehabilitation of an entire road section, typically extending&#13;
eight to 20 km. Consultants are retained to supervise all the works in a project area. An ad-hoc&#13;
Rural Roads Unit, established within PERT to assist in the preparation of the proposed project,&#13;
has been responsible for developing and implementing the Pilot Program. Since July 1995, the&#13;
Unit has become part of PERT-PCR. The progress and preliminary experience on the Pilot was&#13;
assessed during the appraisal mission to incorporate refinements to project design and&#13;
implementation. A more detailed description of the Pilot Program and its accomplishments to&#13;
date is given in Annex 12.&#13;
3.18   Though implementation of the Pilot is still underway, the experience gained to date has&#13;
generally confirmed the validity of the assumptions and data used for project design: i) the local&#13;
consultants (who reside in the project areas) demonstrated capacity to produce suitable designs in&#13;
a timely manner, including adequate economic and technical assessments, at an acceptable cost.&#13;
Feedback from initial reviews allowed to improve the terms of reference for the studies; ii) the&#13;
solutions proposed have been consistent with the type of road encountered, as a function of its&#13;
traffic characteristics and the population served. Consultants' cost estimates are on average about&#13;
US$10,000 per km (net of taxes). This figure has been used for financial planning of the project&#13;
in spite of the fact that so far contractor bids are 10 to 20 percent less than the consultants&#13;
determined values, given that contractors have been inactive in this sector for a long period of&#13;
time; iii) the small local contractors have shown so far sufficient capacity to undertake the works&#13;
under contracts in the range of US$200,000 to US$250,000. They were able to produce bids,&#13;
and where construction has already begun, to undertake the works in an efficient manner. One of&#13;
the aims of the project is the development of the local construction industry and there are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
indications that the project would address this objective; iv) the socio-economic criteria proposed&#13;
for the project were found to be workable and the data readily accessible by consultants for their&#13;
designs. v) the objective of using labor-based methods is being met in terms of the cost percentage&#13;
given to manual labor in the road rehabilitation component. PERT-PCR will monitor this aspect&#13;
more closely on the paving of village streets component to see that local material as well as local&#13;
labor is being used to the greatest extent possible; vi) the targets proposed for the rehabilitation of&#13;
primary and secondary roads were revised to take into account DGC's current accomplishments&#13;
in rehabilitating those networks. This experience has highlighted the need for continuous&#13;
coordination in the field.&#13;
3.19  In general, the findings from the Pilot to date are positive and, where necessary,&#13;
improvements have been incorporated. The incremental nature of the project and the number of&#13;
sub-projects allows for changes and updates to be readily incorporated.&#13;
3.20  Overview of Implementation Arrangements. As noted in paras.2.9 and 2.10, the&#13;
project would be carried out in twelve departments: Ancash, Apurimac, Ayacucho, Cajamarca,&#13;
Cusco, Huancavelica, Huanuco, Junin, Pasco, Puno, San Martin, and Madre de Dios (see Annex&#13;
8). Though not presently envisaged, other departments could be included in the project area in&#13;
addition to, or in substitution of these departments. However, prior to including a new&#13;
department, IDB and the Bank must be satisfied with (1) the adequacy and relevance of the&#13;
project objectives and implementation approach in the said department, (2) the organizational&#13;
structure proposed for the respective implementation unit, and (3) the indicators to assess&#13;
performance of such unit. Recognizing the recurrent issue related to the availability of&#13;
government counterpart funds, the planning of the project will be brought into the phase with the&#13;
Government's budget cycle. PERT-PCR will furnish to IDB and the Bank for review and&#13;
approval, not later than July 31 of each year of project execution, starting in 1996, the proposed&#13;
annual investment plan providing for the activities in each project area, the respective&#13;
justifications and implementation schedules, and proposed budget for each component of the&#13;
project during the upcoming year. Independents consultants, financed under the project, will&#13;
conduct biannual performance audits, to assess the quality of the works, the compliance with&#13;
environmental and procurement procedures set forth in the Project Operational Manual (see para.&#13;
3.29).&#13;
3.21  Road and Street Works Components. The Project Operational Manual establishes&#13;
guidelines, technical specifications and terms of reference for design and supervision of spot&#13;
improvement and rehabilitation works. The guidelines emphasize on-site designs for rural roads,&#13;
to keep engineering cost at an acceptable proportion of the total construction cost, and more&#13;
detailed engineering studies for primary and secondary roads. The use of the Manual will ensure&#13;
consistency in the solutions proposed. Annex 12 includes the list of road sections being&#13;
considered for the Pilot and the first year of project implementation. Contractors and&#13;
communities, the latter engaged through convenios, will carry out the works using labor-based&#13;
methods. Though the exception, it is possible that in some remote areas it could be difficult to&#13;
attract contractors with the machinery required. When not possible, PERT-PCR will contract&#13;
government-owned equipment fleets from either MTC or the subnational governments to&#13;
undertake equipment-intensive activities under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
Box 9 : C:riteria for SelectingFive Pilot Areas for NMTIComponent&#13;
iCriteria Ibrselecting thpilot areas would include but not be limitedto:&#13;
*  location in areas where project road components&amp;are executed to. ensure integrated&amp;sectoral action;&#13;
*  d; ivei;rse existence and use of non-motorized transport modes in order to test a variety of interventio istd&#13;
:r0ael patters that indicate suppressed tranport and mobility needs;&#13;
*  high degreeofvillage interest and existence of organized farmers or community development groups to ensurie:&#13;
i ommunity paticipation;:&#13;
*  commitment of local leadership through designating a local project manger responsible fWor iating contacts.&#13;
with thetconcerned communities.&#13;
3.22   Local consultants will carry out the engineering and supervision of the road works,&#13;
grouped taking into account geographic considerations. The quality of the designs produced so&#13;
far for the Pilot has been good and the costs have been kept below the estimated cost of the&#13;
works. Microenterprises developed through the project will undertake the labor-based routine&#13;
maintenance activities financed by the project. Other maintenance activities that require intensive&#13;
use of equipment will be contracted out to private contractors or carried out through convenios&#13;
with municipalities and MTC.&#13;
3.23   Non-Motorized Rural Transport. The component will be first implemented in five pilot&#13;
sites located in Huancavelica and Cusco. PERT-PCR, the implementing agency will determine&#13;
the location of these sites based on criteria set out in Box 9, and based on the willingness of&#13;
communities to actively participate in the sub-projects. The size of these "sub-projects" are often&#13;
such that feasibility studies become prohibitively expensive. Many of the intangible benefits of&#13;
village level infrastructure improvements are hard to quantify in monetary terms. Expected&#13;
benefits include extended life for the means of transport, safer transport conditions for people and&#13;
"acemilas", time savings through less detours, and improved load carrying capacity.&#13;
3.24   It is crucial that all aspects of the program are closely monitored and evaluated both to&#13;
determine whether it is worthwhile expanding and, if so, highlight any modifications, adjustments&#13;
or changes that may be necessary. A base line survey would be conducted in the five pilot areas&#13;
to choose the variables that would drive the expansion and design of the program. Variables to&#13;
explore include difficulty in reaching health and educational services, the main forms of inter-&#13;
village transport and the routes chosen, the amount of human porterage, the constraints for the&#13;
use of non-motorized modes, and the distances covered. In 1997, the coverage of this component&#13;
will be expanded on the basis of results from the monitoring of the Pilot. Staff trained in this&#13;
methodology will be assigned to the program to coordinate training in all districts.&#13;
3.25   Institutional Development Component. Implementation of the institutional&#13;
development component will be governed by the program of actions outline in Table 8. The&#13;
program entails certain actions that go beyond the scope of the project but are necessary to&#13;
enhance the institutional and financial framework for road sector management in Peru. The&#13;
program also lists the actions needed to carry out the project's institutional development&#13;
component and achieve its development objectives. The technical assistance in rural roads&#13;
planning and maintenance will be provided by an experienced consultant firm, with access to&#13;
international experts. Implementation of the technical assistance to develop microenterprises will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
be done through NGOs with actual experience in developing micro-enterprises for infrastructure&#13;
maintenance. In this approach, the NGOs will have a high stake in the quality of the service&#13;
provided by the micro-enterprises because of their interest in replicating the model elsewhere.&#13;
The microenterprises, in turn, will benefit from the experience and know-how the NGOs have&#13;
accumulated from similar experiences elsewhere. PERT-PCR, in turn, will assure through the&#13;
maintenance component of the project that there is sufficient demand for services of the&#13;
microenterprises. Municipalities will be exposed to the program, and their capacity to monitor&#13;
results strengthened through performance evaluations carried out jointly with PERT-PCR. The&#13;
establishment of an effective technical and management assistance operation to the small and&#13;
medium firms involved in project execution will be contracted out to outside entities (e.g., local&#13;
representations of the Colegio de Ingenieros, CAPECO, and regional universities).&#13;
D. Monitoring, Reporting and Bank Supervision&#13;
3.26 Monitoring. The monitoring of project implementation encompasses two levels. One&#13;
consists of the reviews of project performance and annual plans that will be undertaken by PERT-&#13;
PCR on a continuous basis; the other consists of performance audit exercises that would be&#13;
carried out by an independent firm on a six-month basis. PERT-PCR will select performance&#13;
monitoring indicators to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the UEDs in discharging the&#13;
project. Annex 8 gives details of the indicators proposed for this purpose as well as the design&#13;
and application of the Project Information and Monitoring System that would allow PERT-PCR&#13;
and the Banks to ascertain the progress in the implementation of each sub-project and the degree&#13;
of achievement of the project development objectives (as measured by the outcome of the Logical&#13;
Framework).&#13;
3.27  The project would use an information system for monitoring the implementation of the&#13;
large number of sub-projects scattered across the departments of Peru. The development of the&#13;
system entails the creation of a data base and the procedures for capturing key technical, financial&#13;
and social information for each sub-project. The database system would serve several purposes,&#13;
mainly: i) as decision- and monitoring-support system for the UEDs to know the main&#13;
characteristics of the sub-projects presented to them, record the approval procedures, and, by&#13;
consolidating the information for all the sub-projects under their jurisdiction, monitor overall&#13;
project performance in their department; ii) as monitoring-support system for the PERT-PCR&#13;
central office, which through the consolidation of the data from the UEDs, would have up-to-date&#13;
information on the progress and performance of the overall project; iii) as a supervision-support&#13;
tool for the lending agencies which at annual reviews would count on readily-available&#13;
information and a base for incorporating adjustments to the implementation variables of the&#13;
project; and iv) as an evaluation tool, the database will consolidate the information needed to&#13;
update the project indicators defined in Annex 3 in order to assess progress in achieving the&#13;
objectives of the project.&#13;

- 43 -&#13;
3.28  The maintenance of the data base would be the responsibility of each UED; the PERT-&#13;
PCR, upon receiving the information from the UEDs, on at least a monthly basis, would check the&#13;
consistency of the information and compel the daily maintenance of the database by the UEDs.&#13;
The project information and monitoring system would be installed in PERT-PCR's central office&#13;
and in each deconcentrated unit, and maintained throughout project execution.&#13;
3.29  Every six months, auditors acceptable to IDB and the Bank will conduct a performance&#13;
audit of the implementation of the project by examining a sample a sub-projects under execution&#13;
by the UEDs. The terms of reference, including criteria for establishing the scope and size of the&#13;
sample, are included in Annex 8. The audit will focus on the execution of the project physical&#13;
components (quality and cost of works), procurement procedures, and compliance with the&#13;
guidelines of the Project Operational Manual and the performance indicators agreed between&#13;
PERT-PCR and each UED. Through the audit, cost comparisons will be made available and&#13;
reviewed to identify procurement problems or other factors contributing to variations among the&#13;
different regions; the sample of work sites included in the audit will be expanded according to&#13;
these findings. Agreement was reached at negotiations that MTC through PERT-PCR will (1)&#13;
engage independent consultants acceptable to IDB and the Bank to undertake bi-annual audits,&#13;
starting with the semester January-June 1996, on the performance of PERT-PCR and its UEDs in&#13;
the implementation of the project, including achievement of physical targets, quality and cost of&#13;
the works, compliance with eligibility criteria, procurement, and environmental procedures set&#13;
forth in the Project Operational Manual, and achievement of the performance indicators for each&#13;
UED, and (2) furnish to 1DB and the Bank within 90 days after each semester the report of such&#13;
auditors.&#13;
3.30  Reporting. PERT-PCR will prepare quarterly progress reports for all components of the&#13;
project. These will be sent to the Bank within one month after the end of each quarter and will&#13;
describe (1) progress achieved during the previous quarter in the implementation and in the&#13;
achievement of the objectives of the project based on the performance indicators, (2) an&#13;
assessment of the problems and issues derived from the implementation of the project, (3)&#13;
updated implementation and disbursement schedules for the following two quarters, and (4) status&#13;
of compliance with the legal covenants contained in the Loan Agreement. The reports will&#13;
provide timely and updated information on project implementation, highlighting issues and&#13;
problem areas, recommending actions and commenting on progress in executing previous&#13;
recommendations. The format and contents of the progress reports, including key monitoring&#13;
indicators will be agreed at negotiations.&#13;
3.31  Annual Reviews. During the second quarter each year, the Bank, IDB and the&#13;
Government will conduct a formal joint review of the progress made in reaching the project&#13;
objectives and in implementing the project components. Participants will include key&#13;
representatives from the operating UEDs, pertinent consultants and NGOs involved in the&#13;
technical assistance component, MTC, MEF, decentralized agencies involved in rural&#13;
development programs, and of a sample of beneficiaries.&#13;
3.32  The annual reviews will provide an opportunity to assess (1) progress in project&#13;
implementation and achievement of the project objectives on the basis of agreed performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
indicators and targets, (2) the performance of PERT-PCR and each of its UEDs, (3) the&#13;
effectiveness of the work programs in terms of community and local government involvement,&#13;
local contractors response, coordination with other development programs, and achievement of&#13;
project objectives, (4) progress in implementing the institutional development components,&#13;
including compliance of participating municipalities with the Institutional Action Programs, (5)&#13;
the adequacy of the procedures stated in the Project Operational Manual, (6) progress in&#13;
restructuring and strengthening road maintenance administration and finance, and (7) the&#13;
justification of the investment and institutional proposals for implementation during the&#13;
subsequent year. The project implementation schedule and monitoring indicators will be updated&#13;
during the annual review. PERT-PCR would furnish to IDB and the Bank at least two weeks&#13;
before departure of the annual review mission, a "review report" containing the agenda for the&#13;
meeting, the current status with regard to the topics listed above and the annual plan proposed for&#13;
the prospective year. The format and content of these reviews would be agreed upon at&#13;
negotiations. Agreement was reached at negotiations that MTC and the Government will conduct&#13;
annual project reviews with IDB and the Bank to cover the above mentioned topics, and that in&#13;
the event of unsatisfactory progress, Government will prepare remedial action plans satisfactory&#13;
to IDB and the Bank within two months of the review.&#13;
3.33  Mid-Term Review. The third annual review will constitute a Mid-Term Review of the&#13;
six-year program and provide an opportunity for a more comprehensive assessment of the&#13;
achievements of the project to date, and of the prospects for successful project completion. Prior&#13;
to this review, PERT-PCR will conduct a performance survey in a sample of provinces&#13;
participating in the project to assess the progress in achieving the objectives of the project, as&#13;
defined by the set of agreed indicators. In addition to covering the topics listed above, this review&#13;
will examine the progress made by Government with regard to (1) its agenda for administrative&#13;
decentralization and the need to adjust the operational set up of the project accordingly, (2) the&#13;
establishment of a strategy for rural roads funding and, (3) the improvement of inter-agency&#13;
coordination, and (4) the participation of municipalities in project activities, including the&#13;
possibility that certain municipalities became direct executing agencies under PERT-PCR. The&#13;
review will consider proposals for restructuring or reorienting the program, taking account of all&#13;
relevant sector and project issues. At this stage, government, IDB and the Bank will discuss&#13;
specific arrangements for financing the second phase of the program including decisions on the&#13;
need to start preparation of the follow-on loans to support its execution, the amount of financing&#13;
required, the need to extend the program to cover more departments than the 12 presently&#13;
selected, and other adjustments considered necessary to enhance the development impact of the&#13;
program. Subject to actual performance in project implementation, the comprehensive nature of&#13;
this review is expected to provide sufficient information to appraise Phase II of the program.&#13;
3.34  Project Supervision. Building on the experience gained during project preparation, IDB&#13;
and the Bank will supervise the project through a shared project team. The respective task&#13;
managers will coordinate the timing and composition of field missions. Their frequency will be&#13;
guided by the progress and special requirements of project implementation. The missions are&#13;
expected to supervise the project twice a year. However, the supervision plan calls for a greater&#13;
involvement of the Resident Missions. The field offices will play an active role in (I) reviewing&#13;
sub-project eligibility and procurement. (2) monitoring the monthly update of the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
information system, (3) visiting work sites and municipalities involved in the technical assistance&#13;
program, and (4) providing follow-up and problem-resolution support. Overall, it is estimated&#13;
that the supervision effort will entail about 154 staff weeks for the duration of the project, with&#13;
the Bank's share estimated at about 77 staff-weeks (out of which 30 staff-weeks or 38 percent&#13;
correspond to staff stationed in the Bank's Resident Mission in Peru or local consultants). This&#13;
would result on an average of 20 to 23 staff-weeks during the first three years of project&#13;
implementation, an estimate that reflects synergies expected from sharing project supervision with&#13;
IDB and delegating responsibilities to the Resident Mission. The Bank-IDB Supervision Plan is&#13;
included in Annex 13.&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
3.35   All project components financed under the proposed Bank loan would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for Procurement (January 1995). All procurement&#13;
arrangements were confirmed at loan negotiations to ensure that they are in compliance with both&#13;
Bank and IDB guidelines. Civil works are estimated to account for about 82 percent of total&#13;
project costs, consultant services about 13 percent, and project management about 5 percent.&#13;
Table 9 shows the estimated project cost breakdown by procurement method. Table 10&#13;
summarizes the limits on types of procurement and prior review thresholds.&#13;
3.36  Civil Works. Procurement of small works estimated to cost less than US$50,000 up to&#13;
an aggregate of US$40 million may be done through direct contracting with (1) nuicleos&#13;
ejecutores (which is a recognized entity formed by members of a community to support&#13;
implementation of a specific investment in their area), and (2) micro-enterprises for road&#13;
maintenance developed under the project. This procurement modality would allow for: i)&#13;
implementation of works that would not attract local contractors because of their small size and&#13;
remote location; ii) poor rural communities to directly manage small investments and to make the&#13;
required 20 percent contribution to the work through partial donation of unskilled labor (non-&#13;
motorized rural transport component); and iii) local communities to take an active role in&#13;
maintaining their road infrastructure. The contracting of each work to a nuicleo ejecutor would be&#13;
supported by a technical proposal with its budget (expediente tcnico). PERT-PCR will establish&#13;
a system of standard regional unit prices to guide both the budgeting of the works and review of&#13;
contracts under direct contracting. PERT-PCR's inspectors or the consultants engaged to&#13;
supervise the work programs in a project area will provide monthly certificates and a final&#13;
certificate at completion of the works (actas mensuales-acta de recepci6n), which will specify the&#13;
works done and expenditure incurred, as a proof of successful execution of the work and&#13;
justification for reimbursement by the Special Account. Model agreements will be incorporated&#13;
into the Project Operational Manual. Subject to approval by IDB and the Bank, works (1)&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent and US$4,500,000 equivalent or less in the&#13;
aggregate, (2) of an equipment-intensive nature, and (3) to be carried out in areas where no&#13;
contractors with the required equipment are available, may be procured through force account&#13;
procedures satisfactory to the banks. Under the force account arrangements, the Bank loan will&#13;
finance 45 percent of the total expenditure incurred in respect of each force account package&#13;
("convenio"). In the approval of each convenio, the Bank will ensure that its 45 percent financing&#13;
share only includes the variable cost of equipment. The total cost of these force account packages&#13;
will be determined on the basis of pre-agreed schedules of costs per activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
3.37   Works estimated to cost US$250,000 equivalent or less per contract would be procured&#13;
under fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation would include a&#13;
detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the required completion date, a&#13;
basic form of agreement acceptable to IDB and the Bank, and relevant drawings when necessary.&#13;
All bids received will be opened in public on a predetermined date to be stated in the bidding&#13;
document. The award would be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for&#13;
the required work, and who has the experience and resources to successfully complete the&#13;
contract. Standard bidding documents and standard contract forms would be agreed during&#13;
negotiations and included in the Project Operational Manual. The combined aggregate amount of&#13;
contracts awarded under the above mentioned procedure and direct contracting (para. 3.34)&#13;
would not exceed US$153 million.&#13;

3.38 National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank would be used&#13;
for work contracts above US$250,000. It is anticipated that about US$53 million will be&#13;
procured under NCB procedures, with contracts ranging from US$300,000 to US$2 million. The&#13;
use of standard bidding documents and standard contract forms satisfactory to the Bank was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
agreed during negotiations. No International Competitive Bidding (ICB) is expected because of&#13;
the rather small size of the works financed under the project. However, ICB would be required&#13;
for any contract exceeding US$3 million equivalent. Participation of contractors from countries&#13;
outside the region in NCB and ICB is very unlikely. However, the procurement advertisements&#13;
and the bidding documents, will clearly state that participation of foreign firms from any country&#13;
eligible under the Bank guidelines is not precluded, and that the financing will be secured by the&#13;
Bank loan. In the event that the bidder who has submitted the lowest evaluated bid is from a&#13;
country not eligible under IDB, the Bank will authorize an increase in the pari-passu established&#13;
under the respective loan category in order to cover IDB's portion and meet the expenditures&#13;
incurred in respect of that contract. IDB will authorize a similar increase in respect of other&#13;
contracts eligible under IDB guidelines until the balance is reestablished.&#13;
3.39   Consultant Services. Consultants will be hired following the procedures established in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual. The services include studies, engineering designs, construction&#13;
supervision, technical assistance, training courses and auditing services. By and large, they will be&#13;
provided by local firms and individuals. The procedures already applied to recruit consultants for&#13;
the Pilot Program consistent with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by the World Bank&#13;
and by the World Bank as ani Executing Agency", dated August 1981, and conforming to IDB&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
3.40  Procurement Review. For civil works, all bidding packages of US$ 1.0 million or higher&#13;
will be subject to prior review of advertising, bidding documents, bid evaluation and contract&#13;
award; they will be handled directly by PERT-PCR's central office. The first NCB bidding&#13;
packages prepared by each deconcentrated executing agency of PERT-PCR and all force account&#13;
packages, irrespective of the amount, will also be subject to prior review. For consulting firms,&#13;
services estimated to cost US$100,000, as well as all single-source assignments, will be subject to&#13;
prior review of contracts, terms of reference, and selection procedures; for individual consultants,&#13;
services of US$50,000 or higher will be subject to prior review. For consultant services under the&#13;
above limits only the terms of reference will be subject to prior review.&#13;
3.41   Although the level of prior review would be low (about 15 percent for civil works and&#13;
about 58 percent for consultant services), it would be compensated for in several ways: i) external&#13;
auditors will conduct performance audits every six months (covering technical, environmental,&#13;
procurement and management aspects) on a sample of sub-projects satisfactory to the Bank and&#13;
I:DB (para. 3.29); ii) the project information and monitoring system, would be used to compare&#13;
costs of similar sub-projects within an executing unit and among units in order to detect possible&#13;
discrepancies which might indicate procurement problems and the need for further analysis.&#13;
Accuracy of the data in the project information system will be checked through the audits; and iii)&#13;
Bank and IDB supervision missions will conduct random reviews, including frequent field visits&#13;
and reviews of procurement documentation. It is anticipated that both the IDB and Bank&#13;
Resident Missions will play a key role in this regard.&#13;
3.42 Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing. The loan would finance&#13;
retroactively expenditures incurred under the Pilot Program not more than a year before loan&#13;
signing (see para. 3.17). Implementation of this pilot is being done in consultation with IDB and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
the Bank, including a review by the Bank of procurement actions. It is estimated that total&#13;
payments made in respect of the contracts for civil works and consultants services would be&#13;
around US$18 million. The amount to be financed retroactively out of the proceeds of the Bank&#13;
loan will not exceed 10 percent of the loan amount.&#13;

F. Disbursements, Accounting and Audits&#13;
3.43   Disbursements. The Project Completion date is June 30, 1999. The proposed loan is&#13;
expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1999, the closing date. The disbursement&#13;
schedule by the Bank fiscal year is shown in Table 11. It deviates from the standard disbursement&#13;
profile for Bank projects in Perui to take account of (1) the expenditure incurred under the Pilot&#13;
Program carried out in 1995, which would be financed retroactively, and (2) the slower pace for&#13;
subsequent disbursement, which is typical of projects financing a large number of small&#13;
investments. Disbursement estimates by quarters are given in Annex 14.&#13;

disbursements will be made against statements of expenditure (SOEs). All SOEs would be&#13;
transmitted through PERT-PCR administrative unit in Lima. Documentation supporting the&#13;

SOEs will be retained at PERT-PCR headquarters and made available for examination by Bank&#13;
staff during review missions (see Chart 2 and Annex 8). In addition, other technical and economic&#13;
information regarding the sub-projects included in any disbursement request will also be readily&#13;
available from the project data base (see para. 3.27).&#13;
3.45   Table 12 shows the basis of loan disbursements. Bank loan proceeds would be disbursed&#13;
against the following percentages of eligible expenditures (net of IGV tax): i) 45 percent for civil&#13;
works under the road rehabilitation and village components (90% in the case of contracts&#13;
awarded under NCB procedures to bidders from countries not eligible under IDB procurement&#13;
guidelines); ii) 45 percent of expenditure for works under force account procedures; iii) 30&#13;
percent of expenditure incurred before January 1, 1999 in respect of civil works under the road&#13;
maintenance component and 20% there after; iv) 50 percent for consultant services related to&#13;
feasibility and engineering design studies, supervision of works and performance audits; and v) 50&#13;
percent for technical assistance and training under the institutional development component of the&#13;
project. Loan proceeds under the IDB loan would be disbursed against same categories and&#13;
disbursement percentages under joint cofinancing, except for force account works (expenditure&#13;
under this category though not directly funded out of the IDB loan would be considered by IDB&#13;
as government counterpart funds to the project). Retroactive financing not exceeding US$9&#13;
million (Bank loan) would be provided for eligible expenditures incurred in respect of civil works&#13;
and consultant services under the Pilot Program.&#13;

3.46 Special Account. A Special Account will be opened and maintained in US Dollars, in a&#13;
commercial Bank acceptable to the World Bank. The authorized allocation, sufficient for about&#13;
four months' of financeable expenditures, will be US$6 million. The Bank will replenish the&#13;
Special Account upon receipt of disbursement requests from the Borrower. PERT-PCR will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
control the use of the Special Account and be responsible for preparing the disbursement requests&#13;
on behalf of the Borrower. These requests should be submitted every month, or when the special&#13;
account has been drawn down by a third of its initial deposit, whichever comes first. The&#13;
establishment and operating arrangements for the Special Account were confirmed at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
3.47 Local Currency Account. In addition to the Special Account in US Dollars, PERT-PCR&#13;
will use a local currency account. Agreement was reached at project negotiations that the&#13;
Government will deposit counterpart funds into the PERT-PCR's local currency account at the&#13;
beginning of each month to cover the counterpart funds need for all payments anticipated for that&#13;
month. All project accounts will be managed in accordance with generally accepted international&#13;
accounting standards. The local currency account was established in July 1995 to speed up the&#13;
processing of payments in respect of the Pilot.&#13;
3.48 Audits. At loan negotiations, agreement was reached that Government will appoint&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to IDB and the Bank to audit project expenditures, the Special&#13;
Accounts, the project accounts, and the SOEs, starting with the audit for 1995, in accordance&#13;
with terms of reference acceptable to both banks. Certified copies of the audit reports will be&#13;
furnished to the Bank within six months after the close of the Government's fiscal year. The audit&#13;
report will include a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against certified SOEs.&#13;
G. Project Risks and Safeguards&#13;
3.49  The achievement of the project goal assumes that Government will continue its support to&#13;
the poverty eradication policy and the project throughout its implementation. Specific project&#13;
risks and safeguards are described below.&#13;
3.50  Uncertainty in the development of the decentralization agenda. Project efforts to&#13;
clarify responsibilities in the road sector (see para. 1.32) and to build up capacity at the local level&#13;
through technical assistance will not have the intended impact --that is to mobilize local&#13;
governments to effectively assume their mandate to maintain rural roads-- in the absence of&#13;
adequate sources of funding to support these obligations. It is of the essence that Government&#13;
completes its decentralization agenda, with clear definition of roles and balanced distribution of&#13;
responsibilities and funding for sustainable road maintenance. The project supports a study to&#13;
develop a road-funding strategy that would secure funds for maintenance, and introduces&#13;
maintenance schemes well adapted to the institutional capacity of local governments, in an effort&#13;
to encourage municipalities to adopt a "maintenance culture". At the third annual review, the role&#13;
of local governments and departments (if any) will be carefully reviewed vis a vis the adopted&#13;
decentralization strategy and, if necessary, the project will be restructured to make it consistent&#13;
with the new institutional and financial set up.&#13;
3.51  Weak Institutional Base at the Local Level. The weakness of municipalities could&#13;
hinder permeation of the institutional strengthening component of the project. Factors that may&#13;
contribute to this risk include lack of leadership, shifting priorities and high turn over of public&#13;
officials at the local level. In order to finance investments in any province, the project would&#13;
require municipalities to enter into agreements which will clearly set the undertakings to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
assumed by them (e.g., commitments to maintain the roads, join the technical assistance program,&#13;
and prepare a transport plan). Satisfactory compliance with these agreements will be prerequisites&#13;
for further financing of works in the province. It is intended that the participatory approach built&#13;
into the project design will help develop "ownership" of the project by local governments and&#13;
communities, who will better link the purpose of the project to their own progress.&#13;
3.52  Inexperienced Project Management. The lack of institutional history and experience&#13;
with the project activities in Periu may result in delays in selecting sub-projects, completing pre-&#13;
investment studies and procurement of works, and administering the contracts. To arrest this&#13;
risk, the project implementation unit is organized around three key elements: strengthening&#13;
management skills, deconcentrating decision making, and putting in place performance monitoring&#13;
systems. By constitution, the executing agency will enjoy technical, administrative and financial&#13;
autonomy, and it will be conveniently supported by consultants. A similar scheme adopted for&#13;
implementation of the IDB-Highways I Project has proved successful. The Pilot is bringing out&#13;
experience on how to best handle the work programs.&#13;
3.53 Insufficient Absorptive Capacity of the Domestic Construction Industry. The road&#13;
construction industry is experiencing some difficulty in catching up with the increased demands of&#13;
the massive rehabilitation programs which are underway at the national level. The project targets&#13;
small and medium enterprises who may adapt more easily to the working environment of&#13;
municipalities, and provides technical assistance to further strengthen their managerial and&#13;
technical skills. The works are simple by nature and demand little machinery, but yet making this&#13;
equipment available to the contractors could be difficult in some areas (in which case MTC could&#13;
undertake equipment-intensive activities through special agreements). A study supported by the&#13;
project will further explore possible options to address this issue.&#13;
3.54  Inadequate Provision of Counterpart Funds for Project Implementation. This was a&#13;
recurrent problem in past Bank projects. It is assumed that the existing macro-economic&#13;
conditions will remain throughout project implementation. Nevertheless, the project would&#13;
realign its investment program to be in phase with the Government's budget. In addition, it&#13;
would require advance deposit of counterpart funds into the project account, similar to the&#13;
procedures successfully being employed in the on-going Bank Transport Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
3.55  Resurgence of Guerrilla Activity. The resurgence of guerrilla activity could hamper&#13;
execution of the project components in the affected areas. In the event that this happens, the&#13;
activities in those areas would be postponed until safe execution and supervision is possible.&#13;
However, it is expected that the very nature of the project and its reliance on communities and&#13;
local contractors and consultants for implementation will minimize the possibility of becoming the&#13;
target of guerrilla activity.&#13;
4. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
4.1   Agreement was reached during negotiations that:&#13;
a) MTC through PERT-PCR, will furnish to the Bank for review and approval, (1) not&#13;
later than July 31 of each year of project execution, starting in 1996, the proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
annual implementation plan providing for the activities in each project area, the&#13;
respective justifications and implementation schedules, and proposed budget for each&#13;
component of the project during the upcoming year (para. 3.20), and (2) quarterly&#13;
progress reports, including key monitoring indicators, within one month from the end&#13;
of the quarter (para. 3.30);&#13;
b) MTC through PERT-PCR will engage independent consultants acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, to undertake bi-annual technical audits, starting with the semester January-June&#13;
1996, on the performance of PERT-PCR and its UEDs in the implementation of the&#13;
project, including achievement of physical targets, quality and cost of the works,&#13;
compliance with eligibility criteria, procurement, disbursement, and environmental&#13;
procedures set forth in the Project Operational Manual, and achievement of the&#13;
performance indicators for each UED, and furnish to the Bank within 90 days after&#13;
each semester the report of such auditors (para. 3.29);&#13;
c) MTC and the Government will conduct annual project reviews with the Bank during&#13;
the second quarter of each year, covering the topics of (1) progress in project&#13;
implementation and achievement of project objectives on the basis of agreed&#13;
performance indicators and targets, (2) the performance of the implementing agency,&#13;
(3) the effectiveness of the work programs, in terms of community and local&#13;
governments involvement, local contractors response, coordination with other&#13;
development programs, and achievement of project objectives, (4) progress in&#13;
implementing the institutional development component, including compliance of&#13;
participating municipalities with the Institutional Action Programs, (5) the adequacy of&#13;
the procedures stated in the Project Operational Manual, (6) progress in restructuring&#13;
and strengthening road maintenance administration and finance, and (7) justification of&#13;
the investments and institutional proposals for implementation during the subsequent&#13;
year; and that in the event of unsatisfactory progress, Government will take remedial&#13;
action satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.31). In respect of the third annual review, the&#13;
Government and the Bank will evaluate the following additional items: (1) its agenda&#13;
for administrative decentralization and the need to adjust the operational set up of the&#13;
project accordingly, (2) the establishment of mechanisms for the financing of rural&#13;
roads and streamlining of local road administration practices, (3) the participation of&#13;
municipalities in project activities and the future of PERT-PCR after project&#13;
completion, (4) proposals for the restructuring of the program and specific&#13;
arrangements for financing the second phase of the program (para 3.33);&#13;
d) MTC will carry out the action program set forth in Table 8 of the SAR;&#13;
e) Government will appoint independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank to audit project&#13;
expenditures, the Special Account, Project Accounts and the SOEs starting with the&#13;
audit for 1995, in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to both banks;&#13;
certified copies of the such report will be sent to the Bank within six months after the&#13;
close of the Government's fiscal year (para.3.48).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
4.2   As condition of loan effectiveness, the Executive Committee of PERT will formally&#13;
approve and put into effect, in a manner satisfactory to IDB and the Bank, the Project Operational&#13;
Manual that will guide project implementation; such manual to be modified from time to time in&#13;
consultation with IDB and the Bank as needed to take account of the experience gained during&#13;
project execution (para. 3.7);&#13;
4.3   As condition of disbursement in respect of expenditures in the jurisdiction of, or for the&#13;
benefit of a provincial municipality, that the respective municipality has signed a Participation&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
4.4   As an event of default, the Bank will have the right to suspend disbursements in case (a)&#13;
the IDB loan does not become effective within six months of Bank loan effectiveness, or (b) the&#13;
IDB loan is suspended, canceled or terminated; unless the Government shows that such events&#13;
were not caused by its non-performance and that adequate funds from other sources are available&#13;
for the project.&#13;
4.5   Recommendation. With the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank Single&#13;
Currency Loan of US$90 million in US dollars, payable in 17 years, including five years of grace,&#13;
at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans.&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Transport Sector Overview&#13;
1.    The Peruvian transport system comprises: (i) a classified road network of nearly 70,000&#13;
km., of which about 11 percent is paved; (ii) a system of 24 maritime and river ports; (iii) a&#13;
railway network (about 2,000 km.) made up of seven separate systems, with little physical or&#13;
operational integration; (iv) 300 airports and landing strips, only 16 of which have paved runways;&#13;
and (v) a system of pipelines, the most important of which is the 900 km North Peruvian pipeline&#13;
from the oil fields in the selva to the coast at Bayovar. This system crosses the four distinct&#13;
transport zones of Perii: (i) the central corridor (Callao-Lima-La Oroya-Huancayo); (ii) the&#13;
southern corridor (Matarani-Arequipa-Juliaca-Puno); (iii) the coastal region from Talara in the&#13;
north to lo in the south; and (iv) the Amazonic selva. Rail and trucking carry about equal shares&#13;
of the mineral and concentrate cargo in the central corridor while trucking has a larger share of all&#13;
other products. In the southern corridors, where product markets are more varied, rail and&#13;
trucking are equally important. Within these corridors, there are segments that rely solely on rail&#13;
(e.g., Huancayo-Huancavelica). The coastal region involves some competition between trucking&#13;
and coastal shipping for long- and short-haul cargo. The Pan-American Highway carries&#13;
passengers and freight along the coast and serves as a conduit for export traffic to Peru's Pacific&#13;
coast ports. The Amazonic selva is served by a system of river ports with access to the Atlantic.&#13;
Due to Peru's rugged terrain, airports serve the important function of integrating the four zones.&#13;
2.    Similar to trends in most other countries, the road sector predominates in the transport of&#13;
passengers and freight across Peru. In 1992, the road carried 71% of freight tons, followed by&#13;
river and (mainly) coastal shipping with 25%. Railways have decreased their participation to 4%,&#13;
thought they play an important role along particular corridors--such as Callao-Huancayo with&#13;
779,000 tons transported in 1992, and Matarani-Puno, with about 550,000 tons transported in&#13;
1992. Air freight transport reaches hardly 0.1%. Passenger traffic largely moves by road, with&#13;
the railways playing a critical role along specific corridors--Huancayo-Huancavelica, Matarani-&#13;
Cusco, and Cusco-Machu Pichu-Quillabamba--with about 550,000 passengers transported in&#13;
1992 on each of those lines--that lack adequate access roads.&#13;
3.    Transport infrastructure provision and operations have been concentrated in the hands of&#13;
public sector enterprises. Recent reforms aim at commercializing operations, transferring services&#13;
to the private sector, and reducing the level of public involvement in the construction and&#13;
operations of the various transport infrastructure. One of the initial actions in this respect was the&#13;
privatization of the national airline carrier--Aeroperu--and the transfer of port operations to the&#13;
private sector. On-going efforts include the privatization of the railway company--ENAFER--and&#13;
the creation of a road authority that would increase financial autonomy for the maintenance of the&#13;
national road network.&#13;
4.    Road Sector. Road transport is the dominant mode of domestic transport in Peru,&#13;
carrying about 70 percent of domestic freight traffic and 80 percent of inter-urban passenger&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
traffic. Yet Peru has the lowest endowment in road infrastructure compared to peer countries in&#13;
Latin America. The condition of the road system in Perui is not satisfactory to support national&#13;
economic and social goals. From 1986 to 1991, investments in the road sector were very limited.&#13;
Reflecting a dramatic declining trend, the percentage of government expenditures dedicated to the&#13;
transport sector decreased from 6.1 percent in 1981 to 2.5 percent in 1990. Since 1991,&#13;
investments have grown incrementally, reaching a level of US$370 million in 1994, largely fueled&#13;
by the multilateral and bilateral-financed programs of road reconstruction and rehabilitation.&#13;
Analyses performed by the Planning Office of the Ministry of Transport, Communications,&#13;
Housing and Construction (MTC) indicate that the level of investment would have to reach about&#13;
US$600 million per year in order to bring the road network to satisfactory standards.&#13;
5.    The Peruvian road system comprises almost 70,000 km of roads, of which 11 percent are&#13;
paved roads, 19 percent are gravel roads, while the remaining 70 percent are earth roads and&#13;
trails. This road network is organized into three tiers (Table 1): i) a primary road system of about&#13;
15,692 km of roads or 22 percent of the total network, also known as national roads. Around 36&#13;
percent of these roads are paved. Approximately 70 percent of the freight traffic and 80 percent&#13;
of the passenger traffic takes place over the primary road network; ii) a secondary road system of&#13;
about 14,473 km of roads or 21 percent of the total network. These roads, also known as&#13;
departmental roads because they serve regional or departmental interests, are mostly poorly&#13;
engineered and unpaved; and iii) a rural road system of about 39,805 km. Most of this system&#13;
consists of short roads and tracks located in the sierra region at altitudes ranging between 1,500&#13;
and 4,600 meters above sea level.&#13;
6.    Administration of roads in Peru has gone through fundamental changes in the last decade,&#13;
in part due to a protracted decentralization process which is still far from being settled. Reform&#13;
measures instituted by the Government in recent years to improve the organization of the sector&#13;
have yielded mixed results. Historically, the General Directorate of Roads (DGC - Direccion&#13;
General de Caminos) within MTC had overall responsibility for the planning, design, construction&#13;
and maintenance of the entire road system, working through the central office in Lima and 24&#13;
deconcentrated Departmental Directorates. In 1982, the Regionalization Law transferred to the&#13;
new regional governments the jurisdiction over all roads, including the departmental directorates,&#13;
their equipment and staff. This mandate was partially reversed in 1991, when MTC was&#13;
reassigned the responsibility for managing the national road network, while the secondary and&#13;
rural roads networks remained respectively under the control of regions and local governments.&#13;
DGC accomplishes its activities through quasi-force account arrangements (Programa de Acci6n&#13;
Civica), military brigades, and to a lesser extent private contractors. Four district offices have&#13;
been recreated under DGC, but with very limited resources and an unclear mandate.&#13;
7.    DGC is too debilitated even to manage the national road network on its own. In 1992, a&#13;
special executing unit, PERT-Proyecto Especial de Rehabilitaci6n del Transporte, was&#13;
established to undertake implementation of multilateral-funded road rehabilitation projects. PERT&#13;
enjoys a special legal status, which provides for more financial autonomy and employment&#13;
conditions close to those prevailing in the private sector. This scheme has allowed improved&#13;
efficiency in project implementation. Later, in 1993, Government created S1NMAC-Sistema&#13;
Nacional de Mantenimiento de Carreteras to administer toll road collection and develop road&#13;
concessions and Build-Operate-Transfer schemes to bring the private sector in to manage and&#13;
finance road maintenance and rehabilitation. Results in this respect have been very limited so far.&#13;

8.    Departmental and rural roads receive insufficient attention from the various agencies&#13;
falling under the jurisdiction of regional and local governments. A weak institutional base, ill-&#13;
defined responsibilities, and strong dependence on central government budgetary allocations have&#13;
prevented the 11 Regional Temporary Administrative Councils (CTAR-Consejo Transitorio&#13;
Administrativo Regional) from coordinating regional development programs among the large&#13;
number of actors involved. Their interventions in the road sector have been limited to occasional&#13;
works, mostly carried out under unproductive force account arrangements. The "regionalization"&#13;
effort to place organizations closer to the regions did not increase their accountability and&#13;
capacity to deliver more responsive services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
9.    The Municipal Law (Ley Orgdnica de Municipalidades) passed in 1984 made&#13;
provincial and district municipalities responsible for rural roads investment planning and&#13;
maintenance, but such responsibilities are not commensurate with the institutional and&#13;
financial capacity of those municipalities. This, compounded with ambiguities and&#13;
overlaps in the roles of the different levels of government and inherited dependency from&#13;
central govemment, results in a generalized avoidance of accountability in the sector. In&#13;
response to the weaknesses of local governments, community-based organizations have&#13;
intervened in an attempt to fill the gap and cope with the most compelling needs, but these&#13;
efforts have been isolated and unsustainable. The result is a very large rehabilitation&#13;
backlog and the resulting poor serviceability of the departmental and rural road network.&#13;
10.   Vehicle Fleet. The vehicle fleet has grown an average of 2.8 percent per annum&#13;
from 1988 to 1993 (Table 2). The largest growth percentages pertain to rural vehicles and&#13;
buses (12.5 and 8.2 percent, respectively). This is a consequence of the initial low levels&#13;
of motorization in rural areas and the rapid increase over the period as a consequence of&#13;
growth in the rural areas. Vehicle ownership remains rather skewed and while in Lima&#13;
there is one vehicle for every 15 persons, fourteen departments have one vehicle for every&#13;
100 people or less. With the deregulation of imports in 1991, the number of vehicle&#13;
imports has grown substantially since then (up to 24,000 units), after a period with low&#13;
numbers (annual average imports of less than 2,500 units from 1986 to 1990) when&#13;
restrictions on the import of vehicles limited the purchase of new vehicles from the high&#13;
cost domestic plants. The recent increases have helped reduce the average age of the total&#13;
vehicle fleet (in spite of the fact that the increase has mostly been made up of second-hand&#13;
vehicles). Vehicle operating costs are high and particularly important for the growing&#13;
number of vehicles operating on the secondary and tertiary networks, due to the bad&#13;
condition of these networks. Traffic densities remain low, and less than 4 percent of the&#13;
kilometers of the national network have traffic volumes of more than 1,000 vehicles per&#13;
day. As one reflection of the deteriorated condition of the network, traffic safety remains&#13;
a compelling issue in the road sector (and particularly in urban areas). Statistical data&#13;
show more than 53 annual deaths per 10,000 vehicles, ranking Peru among the developing&#13;
countries with very high fatality rates. An on-going study financed under Loan 3717-PE&#13;
will address this issue and propose specific actions to improve road safety in Peru.&#13;

11.   Railways. A six-member Board of Directors, all appointed by the Ministry of&#13;
Transport, oversees the railway company and appoints its manager. In light of&#13;
deteriorating traffic, finances, track infrastructure, and rolling stock and inefficient&#13;
operating practices (some worsened by difficult topography) the government is&#13;
undertaking an action plan to increase ENAFER's autonomy and accountability by&#13;
delineating management responsibilities, reimbursing the company for the provision of&#13;
public service obligations (or alternatively, allowing the closing of uneconomic services),&#13;
and supporting measures--payment of a labor redundancy program, resolution of financial&#13;
obligations, organizational restructuring into three self-contained operating units, and&#13;
undertaking only critical emergency investments--to permit, ultimately, the privatization of&#13;
the entity. The form of this privatization has yet to be defined, but the likely approach&#13;
would consist of a combination of concessions and outright sale of specific branches which&#13;
are directly link to mining operations (e.g., Callao-Huancayo) or tourist attractions (e.g.,&#13;
Cusco-Machu Pichu). Developments in this respect (including financial support to a&#13;
rehabilitation program and key emergency investments) are being pursued and monitored&#13;
under Loan 3717-PE of the Transport Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
12.   Aviation. The aviation sector plays, as the railways do, a crucial role in&#13;
communicating areas of the country that, mainly due to topography, lack any other means&#13;
of transport. Furthermore, the success of recent trade liberalization efforts depends on the&#13;
proper functioning of aviation not to undermine the competitive edge of emerging export-&#13;
oriented activities such as fresh flowers and fruits and value-added textile manufacturing.&#13;
Management and operation of 59 public airports and landing strips as well as the air traffic&#13;
control and en-route navigation systems are carried out by the Corporaci6n Peruana de&#13;
AeropuertosyAviaci6n Comercial (CORPAC) which is overseen by MTC. Another set&#13;
of 133 airports and landing strips are privately owned, while 113 more are under the&#13;
control of Peru's municipalities and the Ministry of Defense. Most of all these airports,&#13;
however, basic navigational aids, radio contracts, or night lack time landing equipment.&#13;
None has more than one runway. This situation is particularly critical at the Lima&#13;
international airport whose runway and taxiway are badly in need of rehabilitation (the&#13;
rehabilitation is being financially supported by Loan 3713-PE.) CORPAC has improved&#13;
its operating results since 1989, particularly since the sale of Aeroperu--which owed&#13;
CORPAC large debts for services rendered as far back as 1985--and is proceeding with a&#13;
program of privatization, to contract out some of its airport services, and of labor&#13;
redundancy. Similarly, in January 1993, Aeroperu, the national carrier was sold to a&#13;
private consortium, fuirther reducing the burden on government finances. In general, the&#13;
aviation sector reforms have reduced paperwork and liberalized charges and fees and the&#13;
provision of airport landside services.&#13;
13.   Waterborne Transport. Ocean freight transport accounts for 95 percent of all&#13;
Peruvian international trade and for 25 percent of domestic freight. In the past, prior to&#13;
recent implementation of deregulation procedures, the Empresa Nacional de Puertos de&#13;
Perui (ENAPU) managed and operated about 16 of the 27 Peruvian ports (the rest being&#13;
privately operated or held by public industrial companies). In addition, there was a&#13;
national shipping line operating under a series of protective rules and regulations, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
stevedoring services were in the hands of a public monopoly. This framework created a&#13;
port system that, except for the independently-held ports (mainly handling export bulk&#13;
materials, petroleum and petroleum products), performed poorly. The framework&#13;
encouraged ill-conceived investments and inefficient operations mainly caused by the lack&#13;
of competition (e.g., port facilities at Paita and Salaverry were under-utilized). Since&#13;
1991, a series of decrees (Legislative Decree Nos. 644 and 688, and Supreme Decree No.&#13;
20-91-TC) (a) greatly simplify vessel registration requirements and procedures, (b)&#13;
eliminated all previous restrictions on export and import of cargo, including the payment&#13;
of fees when foreign vessels were used and the cargo reservation rules that favored the&#13;
recently-liquidated national shipping line; (c) phased out all administrative restrictions on&#13;
coastal shipping routes; and (d) permitted the introduction of private entities into ENAPU&#13;
port operations. As a result of these measures several international routes have been&#13;
reactivated and port tariffs (now set to account for ENAPU's real costs) have decreased&#13;
by between 30 and 50 percent. There still exist some distortions of subsidizing domestic&#13;
tariffs by levying higher tariffs on importers and exporters (to better compete with road&#13;
transport), and, though there is no immediate pressure for expanding infrastructure&#13;
facilities, there exist a great need for maintenance and modernization to be able to realize&#13;
the corresponding efficiency gains in port operations. These arguments also applied at a&#13;
smaller scale to the lake port of Puno, and the river ports of Iquitos, Yurimaguas,&#13;
Pucallpa, Puerto Maldonado, some of which suffer hydro-morphologic changes making&#13;
the facilities inaccessible for a significant part of the year.&#13;

RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Previous Bank and other Donors Experience in the Transport Sector&#13;
Overview of World Bank Experience&#13;
1.     Since 1952, the Bank has made 18 loans to Perfu in the transport sector totaling US$641&#13;
million. However, only 52 percent (or two-thirds if the most recent Transport Rehabilitation&#13;
Project is not considered) have been disbursed. Of the total, 46 percent was for highway projects,&#13;
17 percent for urban projects (a large part of which had urban transport components), 12 percent&#13;
for multi-modal projects, 12 percent for aviation, 9 percent for railways, and 3 percent for ports.&#13;
The Bank suspended loan disbursements for all projects in Perfu in May 1987, at which time the&#13;
Bank had made a total of 17 loans to Peru[ in the transport sector totaling US$491 million of&#13;
which US$169 million was later canceled. In the 1990s the Bank and other donors resumed&#13;
lending operations to Pert! and in 1994, the Bank made a loan in the transport sector of US$150&#13;
million for the Transport Rehabilitation project with possible cofinancing of US$38 million from&#13;
KfW, the German bilateral agency. In the rural infrastructure sector, the Bank also has an on-&#13;
going US$100 million loan to support FONCODES, which includes funding for labor-intensive&#13;
projects in poor rural areas (about one third of the project consists of developing economic&#13;
infrastructure in rural areas). Table 1 lists all the Bank projects in the Transport sector.&#13;

2.    The Transport Rehabilitation project consists of five components, the most important&#13;
concerning road rehabilitation. Six roads totaling 725 km would be rehabilitated under the&#13;
project. In addition, this component includes (i) a bridge program involving the acquisition and&#13;
recovery of Bailey bridges and the reconstruction of derelict old bridges; (ii) a pilot maintenance&#13;
program focusing on 620 km of road in a specified corridor, and (iii) a traffic safety program. In&#13;
parallel, the project would support government efforts to rebuild an institutional structure capable&#13;
of maintaining the road system. The other components include help to privatize and rehabilitate&#13;
the railway; rehabilitation of Lima's airport runway; a pilot project for non-motorized transport in&#13;
Lima to test methods of promoting the use of bicycles by low-income residents; and technical&#13;
assistance and training which would (i) strengthen the institutional capacity for managing roads&#13;
and bridges, and to support the creation and fostering of an autonomous agency responsible for&#13;
planning, operating, financing, and administering the highway network; (ii) build capacity in the&#13;
MTCC to manage environmental issues; and (iii) assist the railway in its privatization and&#13;
improving its management.&#13;
3.    The Rural Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance RRRMP project under review in this&#13;
SAR will be the second in the Transport sector since the resumption of lending operations with a&#13;
proposed loan of $90 million.&#13;
Other Multi- and Bilateral Donors&#13;
4.    The following discussion of other donors in the Transport sector does not cover all the&#13;
donors, but provides an insight into other participants in the sector. The IDB is the main funding&#13;
counterpart to the World Bank and the other donors largely act as parallel cofinanciers on the&#13;
various projects. The World Bank works in close collaboration with the IDB and on this RRRMP&#13;
project both agencies are acting as equal joint cofinanciers, rather than as parallel cofinanciers&#13;
which is usually the case.&#13;
5.   Inter-American Development Bank E1)B. In the period 1961 to 1989 the IDB had&#13;
loaned US$150 million in the Transport and Communications sector. In the 1990's IDB&#13;
approved two road rehabilitation loans totaling US$462 million. The first, in 1991, is a loan of&#13;
US$210 million for the Highway Repair and Maintenance project (Loan 651-OC-PE). The total&#13;
project cost is US$300 million with parallel cofinancing of US$50 million from CAF&#13;
(Corporaci6n Andina de Fomento), possible cofinancing of US$30 million from EIB, and grants&#13;
from Japan for studies, rehabilitation of locomotives and acquisition of road maintenance&#13;
equipment. The executing agency for the project is MTC Ministry of Transportation and&#13;
Communications. The project involves i) repair of about 1,400 km of the Pan American and&#13;
Central Highways as well as the repair of bridges and other structures; ii) periodic maintenance of&#13;
about 2,000 km of pavement, made up of 1,744 km of the Pan American Highway and 256 km of&#13;
the Central Highways between Lima and Huanuco; iii) administration and supervision; iv)&#13;
subsector reorganization. The project will fund studies to help the Government formulate policies&#13;
in the sector.&#13;
6.    The second, in 1994, is a loan of US$252 million for the Highway Rehabilitation and&#13;
Improvement program, Phase II (Loan 836-OC-PE). The total project cost is US$420 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
with the remainder being financed by the Government (no cofinanciers). This project is intended&#13;
to continue the work ofthe 1991 loan. In 1995, the IDB will be approving financing for the Rural&#13;
Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project with an amount of US$90 million. This is joint&#13;
cofinancing with the World Bank. The two Banks have worked closely on the development of the&#13;
RRRMIP project.&#13;

Note: Proposedfunding for RRRMP&#13;
7.    Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau KfW. In the 1990s, the German bilateral agency has&#13;
provided about US$5.8 million in funding for general Technical Assistance in all sectors, US$36&#13;
million for Structural Assistance, and is considering a US$38 million loan in parallel cofinancing&#13;
to the World Bank funded Transport Rehabilitation Project with a possible follow-up operation to&#13;
complete rehabilitation of a main road corridor (Olmos-Corral Quemado). It is also anticipated&#13;
that KfW will contribute US$90 million in 1995 to the Alternative Development program focusing&#13;
on irrigation. The World Bank is coordinating with GtZ, a German bilateral agency engaged only&#13;
in technical assistance, in its work in road maintenance and institutional building programs.&#13;
8.    Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund OECF - Japanese ODA. In 1991, OECF&#13;
provided the equivalent of US$616 million for Trade Sector Adjustment and in 1992 the&#13;
equivalent of US$143 million for Financial Sector Adjustment. Japan has contributed significantly&#13;
to project development. Under the IDB financed 1991 HIighway Repair and Maintenance Phase I&#13;
project, grants were given by Japan for studies, rehabilitation of locomotives and acquisition of&#13;
road maintenance equipment. The studies for the Bank's Transport Rehabilitation project were&#13;
funded by Japanese grants. A US$1.1 million Japanese Policy and Human Resources Grant was&#13;
used for the preparation of this RRRMP project as well as a second planned Transport&#13;
Rehabilitation project. The OECF is interested in cofinancing of the Government's commitment&#13;
of the ongoing World Bank funded 1994 Transport Rehabilitation project.&#13;
9.    OPEC Fund for International Development. The OPEC Fund contributed US$5&#13;
million to the Government's commitment of the Lima airport component of the ongoing World&#13;
Bank funded 1994 Transport Rehabilitation project.&#13;
10.   United States Agency for International Development USAID. USAID involvement in&#13;
Peruz aims at promoting democracy and civil society, countering the threat of the narcotics trade,&#13;
expanding microenterprises and small business development, expanding access to the use of basic&#13;

health and family planning services, and protecting the environment. It has a proposed budget of&#13;
approximately US$100 million for FY1996. Two projects are particularly related to the proposed&#13;
RRRMP project, i) the Development of Local Government program (PGEAGL) in conjunction&#13;
with INADE in the Ministry of the Presidency and ii) the 'Alternative Development Program'&#13;
(PDA) also under INADE. USAID will through PERT-PCR coordinate its projects with the&#13;
Bank's RRRMP project since both are aimed at the development of institutional capacity at local&#13;
level and rural development. The US Government will provide US$30 million over a five-year&#13;
period for the Alternative Development Program. Rehabilitation of feeder roads located within&#13;
the watershed where the alternative development program will be implemented is considered&#13;
crucial to the success of the PDA. The alternative development program is located in specific&#13;
small areas of the six departments of Ucayali, Huanuco, Pasco, San Martin, Ayacucho and Cusco&#13;
of which the latter five are departments selected for the RRRMP. Huanuco, Pasco, San Martin&#13;
are included in the second phase expansion of the RRRMP project to 12 Departments in 1997.&#13;
DGC has executed road rehabilitation in 1994 in the areas targeted by the USAID program in&#13;
Ayacucho and Cusco.&#13;
Lessons learned from previous projects&#13;
11.   Aside from the macroeconomic conditions which beset the country in 1983 and led to the&#13;
default on the Government's debt service payments to the Bank and hence to the suspension of&#13;
disbursements, lack of counterpart funds and institutional weaknesses have often been the main&#13;
reasons for the unsatisfactory performance or delays in transport projects. Besides,&#13;
implementation of these projects has been difficult due to the technical problems caused by&#13;
extreme physical conditions, inadequate engineering designs, and weak project management&#13;
aggravated by low salary levels of professionals in the executing agencies. The creation of PERT&#13;
as the unit which is implementing the Transport Rehabilitation project as well as the IDB projects&#13;
has attempted to address these shortcomings.&#13;
12.   Feeder road components were included in eight Bank loans to Peru which supported&#13;
overall highway development, transport corridor improvements, rural development, and&#13;
reconstruction after a major disaster. Experience exists with free-standing feeder road projects&#13;
elsewhere, especially in Africa and Asia. The principal problems in achieving sustainable results&#13;
have been (1) institutional weaknesses and inadequate coordination, leading to delays in&#13;
implementation and incomplete execution of the works; (2) inadequate monitoring of results.&#13;
13.   Bank-wide experience has resulted in the following advise for designing a successful rural&#13;
road projects: i) there should be strong government commitment and beneficiary participation to&#13;
ensure the sustainability of service and infrastructure; ii) a central focal point should be established&#13;
for formulating and reviewing rural roads policy, for project planning and execution, and for co-&#13;
ordination between the ministries of agriculture, interior and transport ; iii) a strong and dedicated&#13;
project management team should be created to assure timely implementation and adequate&#13;
monitoring of the project; and iv) the capacity for labor-based methods and intermediate means of&#13;
transport should be developed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

14.   Relevant to the road maintenance component of the RRRMMP, are the lessons learned from&#13;
the Peru Road Reconstruction project (Loan 706-PE, US$30 million, 1970), which included&#13;
technical assistance for road maintenance. The Project Performance Audit report indicates that&#13;
the major obstacles to the efficient implementation of an adequate maintenance program were&#13;
identified as i) the lack of a reporting system which would provide MTC in Lima with adequate&#13;
and timely information; ii) inadequate mechanisms for work planning and control; iii) insufficient&#13;
time devoted to highway maintenance in the regions, where MTC's advisory staff carried joint&#13;
responsibility for vehicle registration and other traffic operational duties; iv) SEM's inability to&#13;
supply and maintain highway maintenance equipment adequately while discharging obligations to&#13;
construction work forces and some other Government agencies; v) a poorly conceived&#13;
SEM/MTC interrelation which lacked incentives for SEM to maximize equipment availability; and&#13;
vi) the lack of necessary equipment and funds for maintenance operations.&#13;
15.   The lessons learned from this project report are recognized and the RRRMP has been&#13;
developed accordingly. Primarily, the difficulties experienced in ensuring central-government&#13;
Lima-based maintenance of a myriad scattered rural roads and the failure of traditional municipal&#13;
force account works, are acknowledged. In line with the decentralization process in the country,&#13;
the responsibilities for rural road maintenance will be decentralized. A management system is&#13;
being developed for the RRRMP project for co-ordination with the decentralized units for the&#13;
project. Technical assistance would be provided to develop micro-enterprises formed by groups&#13;
of beneficiaries for road maintenance on the recommendation that the private sector be more&#13;
involved in the form of municipal contracts with small local engineering firms and road&#13;
maintenance micro-enterprises. Micro-enterprises have been successfully developed for road&#13;
maintenance projects in Colombia and the Government of Perui has shown a strong interest in this&#13;
approach. The question of road funding will be addressed in the studies funded under the&#13;
RRRMP project,&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Non-Motorized Rural Transport Component&#13;
Sub-project sites and selection criteria&#13;
1.    The Non-Motorized Transport NMT component will first be implemented in five pilot&#13;
sites, two sites in the Department of Cusco and three sites in the Department of Huancavelica.&#13;
Given the intention to create a continuous, integrated 'farm-to-market' network of rural&#13;
infrastructure, project sites for the NMT component and road improvements under the 'main'&#13;
project must connect. By end-1995 PERT-PCR will have determined the location of the five pilot&#13;
sites and development of the pilot of the component will start in 1996. Selection of the pilot sites&#13;
will be based on the criteria set out in the Box I and using available information, such as data on&#13;
population, agricultural production, terrain characteristics, current transport patterns, and the&#13;
village-level infrastructure inventory for the Department of Huancavelica prepared by consultants&#13;
(Final Report Study for Formulation of a Rural Road Program). Furthermore, selection of pilot&#13;
sites will depend on commitment of local leadership (Alcaldes) and willingness of communities to&#13;
participate actively in the sub-projects.&#13;
2.    In 1997, the coverage of the component will be expanded to the 12 Departments of the&#13;
'main' project, using selection criteria and successful methodologies developed in the pilot&#13;
experiences. Again, selection criteria will include the condition that selected project sites must&#13;
connect with road improvements under the 'main' project. The technical assistance services&#13;
needed to expand coverage of this component will be procured by PERT-PCR by end- 1996 to&#13;
avoid delays in implementation.&#13;
Box i: Criteria for selecting five pilot sites for NMT Component&#13;
Criteria for selecting the pilot sites would include but not be limited to:&#13;
*  location in areas where project road components are executed to ensure, integrated sectoral action;&#13;
* diverse existence and use of non-motorized transport modes in order to test a variety of interventions; current&#13;
travel patterns that indicate suppressed transport and mobility needs;&#13;
*  high degree of village interest and existence of organized farmers or community development groups to ensure&#13;
community participation;&#13;
0  commitment of local leadership through designating a local project manager responsible for initiating&#13;
contacts with the concened coimunities&#13;
Evaluation of sub-project proposals&#13;
3.     The size of the sub-projects are often such that feasibility studies become prohibitively&#13;
expensive. Many of the intangible benefits of village level infrastructure improvements are hard to&#13;
quantify in monetary terms. Expected benefits include increased safety and reliability and time&#13;
savings through less detours. PERT-PCR's deconcentrated Units (UEDs) will evaluate the&#13;
project proposals submitted by the communities, based on the following guidelines: that i) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
selected works connect with roads being rehabilitated under the project; ii) the community has&#13;
determined its priorities and is committed to undertaking the works; iii) the proposed works are&#13;
consistent with the typical designs and standard costs expected under the NMT component.&#13;
Technical assistance to communities&#13;
4.    In the pilot, technical assistance will be provided to the communities to assist them identify&#13;
and prioritize the interventions and implement the sub-projects. Technical assistance will also be&#13;
provided to the involved communities to develop sustainable institutional capacity at community&#13;
level to prepare, implement and manage similar projects. This approach is intended to create a&#13;
sense of ownership at community level and therefore technical assistance should be provided by&#13;
an organization, experienced in working with rural communities and familiar with participatory&#13;
methodologies. Furthermore, technical assistance staff attached to the project must be located&#13;
close to the project sites to observe perceptions and attitudes of the participating communities.&#13;
Given these requirements, it is recommended that PERT-PCR identifies a suitable NGO to&#13;
provide the technical assistance for pilot of the NMT component by end-1995. Draft terms of&#13;
reference for the technical assistance to be provided are given in Attachment 1.&#13;
5.    The technical assistance provided to the communities will include development of training&#13;
programs for the community organization, to i) familiarize them with commercial practices&#13;
required to manage and use allocated funds; ii) identify priority interventions, and iii) ensure&#13;
project sustainability. The training programs will be developed in close collaboration with PERT-&#13;
PCR and must be sensitive to and build on existing capacities and practices of communities, with&#13;
special focus on increased participation of women in project activities.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
6.    Development of the component will start in 1996 and cover a time span of 18 months to&#13;
ensure adequate preparation, implementation and monitoring. The consultant engaged for the&#13;
supervision of road rehabilitation works will also be responsible for steering and facilitating&#13;
implementation of the NMT projects. The project itself however should be implemented on the&#13;
ground by the participating community. The deconcentrated units of PERT-PCR will be&#13;
extensively involved in the development of the NMT component. The nature and type of works&#13;
to be executed is demand driven and will be determined during project implementation. Cost&#13;
estimates of procurement will be based on standard designs and standard unit prices for various&#13;
types of improvements (structures, drainage, etc.). As spelled out in the attached terms of&#13;
reference, the consultant providing technical assistance in the pilot of the component, will prepare&#13;
a design manual that includes these data. The contracts for works are small and in remote and&#13;
scattered areas. PERT-PCR will disburse against certification of completion of each stage of the&#13;
works by the Rural Roads Supervision Consultant. This procedure intends to establish an&#13;
effective disbursement practice that focuses on the results of the work, i.e. the physical&#13;
verification that the structure has been built (and meets specified quality standards). Procurement&#13;
of goods and materials will meet requirements of economy and efficiency; the attached sample&#13;
contract provides options that are acceptable to the Banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
7.    To ensure accountability for the use of funds, the participating communities will open a&#13;
Bank account in the name of the sub-project to be operated only upon terms and conditions&#13;
specified in the contract between PERT-PCR and the community group. A sample contract for&#13;
these kind of activities is in the Project Files. After a reasonable advance to initiate works,&#13;
disbursements will be made in tranches by PERT-PCR upon certification of the supervision&#13;
consultant that the works have been satisfactorily completed.&#13;
8.    Community contribution can increase community commitment to the project; this includes&#13;
making communities responsible for maintenance of improved facilities. The project would&#13;
finance 80 percent of the total cost estimated by PERT-PCR for the proposed works based on&#13;
standard designs and unit costs. This would fully cover the cost of materials, equipment and&#13;
skilled labor, while most of the unskilled labor would be contributed by the community. PERT-&#13;
PCR will approve the wages for skilled masons to be funded under the project.&#13;
Contractual Issues&#13;
9.    Advance payments to initiate the activities must stipulate the purpose for which such&#13;
advances are to be used in the contract between the PERT-PCR and the communities. The&#13;
contract should also include adequate accounting guarantees. Performance guarantees will be&#13;
difficult to comply with for the targeted small community groups and should be waived against a&#13;
well defined program. These considerations are reflected in the sample contract.&#13;
10.   The selected consultant for the pilot may wish to sub-contract technical assistance services&#13;
it cannot perform itself. In this case, it must inform PERT-PCR timely and in writing of its&#13;
decision to do so and PERT-PCR has to approve the method and process through which the&#13;
subcontracting may be achieved. PERT-PCR will have a final say in the selection of such&#13;
subcontractors.&#13;
Expansion of the component&#13;
11.   The NMT component will be expanded based on the findings from the pilot. For&#13;
expansion within the pilot areas, communities will only be eligible for follow-up projects if they&#13;
demonstrate a proven track record in providing adequate routine and periodic maintenance of the&#13;
improved infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Non-Motorized Rural Transport Component&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference for Technical Assistance&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Transport and mobility of goods and people in rural areas relies on the existence of&#13;
adequate infrastructure and availability of appropriate and efficient transport modes. An&#13;
unclassified network of tracks and footpaths services a substantial part of the transport needs of&#13;
the rural poorest, women in particular, for whom the majority of transport movements are&#13;
unrelated to the rural road network. Physical barriers, e.g. river crossings, and poor condition,&#13;
e.g. lack of drainage, of the tracks and paths hamper efficient use of traditional transport modes,&#13;
such as mules. Furthermore, the lack of common roadside storage facilities are a major constraint&#13;
for the development of an efficient intermodal transport system that combines farm-roadside non-&#13;
motorized transport with roadside-market motorized transport.&#13;
2.    Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) represents an innovative approach in the transport&#13;
sector. It is very important to create awareness about the sentiments behind it so that participants&#13;
attach to it the importance it requires to make it successful and to create a sense of ownership at&#13;
community level. If a project is believed to be Government property, people loose the motivation&#13;
to participate actively in the belief that operation and maintenance is Government's responsibility.&#13;
This approach will require technical assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity at village&#13;
level to implement the pilot and to start sustainable management of village level infrastructure.&#13;
Technical assistance should be provided by an organization, experienced in working with rural&#13;
communities and familiar with participatory methodologies. Its staff, attached to the pilot, must&#13;
locate close to the project sites and their academic background must be such that they are able to&#13;
observe perceptions and attitudes of the participating communities.&#13;
3.    The Non-Motorized Transport NMT project is a component of the Rural Roads&#13;
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRRMP) which is being implemented through the offices&#13;
of PERT-PCR in the Ministerio de Transportes, Comunicaciones, Vivienda y Construcci6n&#13;
MTC. Initially the RRRMP is being implemented as a pilot program in six Departments of Peru6&#13;
(Ancash, Apurimac, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Cusco, Huancavelica). The RRRMP is supported by&#13;
funding from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.&#13;
Objectives of Consultant Services&#13;
4.    The objective of the consultant services is to assist local communities in the five pilot areas&#13;
in identifying priorities in village-level NMT infrastructure improvements and in developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
mechanisms for sustainable management and maintenance of improved NMT infrastructure. The&#13;
developed procedures must support the creation of institutional capacity at community level to&#13;
implement and manage village-level infrastructure, and should promote a sense of ownership by&#13;
the beneficiaries.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
5.    The services to be provided will include, but not be limited to the following:&#13;
(a) present the NMT objectives and possible components to all (including women's groups)&#13;
members of the selected communities;&#13;
(b)   determine existing institutional capacity and where lacking assist communities in the set-&#13;
up of organizational and administrative structures that enable them to implement the&#13;
NMT component, especially in regard to the right to administer resources and conclude&#13;
contracts, related to the sub-projects. To ensure sustainability, the consultant will assist&#13;
in the formation of formal Committees and the drafting of by-laws for the Committee's&#13;
functioning and the functioning of elected office bearers, including, inter alia, (i) the&#13;
composition, duties and powers of office bearers, (ii) arrangements for use of income and&#13;
income sharing, (iii) establishment of overall goals and policies of the Committee, (iv)&#13;
establishment of processes for regular reporting on financial and physical progress of the&#13;
project, (v) establishment of internal control procedures that ensure proper accounting&#13;
and use of the funds, (vi) development of regular meeting schedules for the entire&#13;
Committee, and (vii) a list of key decisions for which the office bearers need the&#13;
authorization of the entire committee;&#13;
(c) assist and advise communities during the project identification process and provide options&#13;
for various types and costs of possible interventions, ranging from the construction of&#13;
footbridges to the construction of simple roadside storage facilities;&#13;
(d) assist communities in the prioritization of proposed interventions, emphasizing the&#13;
importance of involving all interested community members, and assist in preparation of&#13;
project proposals;&#13;
(e) assist the community organization in the organization and operation of Bank accounts&#13;
related to the sub-project(s);&#13;
(f) provide to the communities the services of qualified personnel through all stages of the&#13;
activities carried out under the sub-project(s);&#13;
(g) procedures described in the Project Operational Manual to be obtained from PERT-PCR.&#13;
When subcontracting of works by the community organization is required, the consultant&#13;
assists in selecting contractors that are appropriately licensed. However, in the case of&#13;
subcontracting for a specified portion of the work, e.g. masonry, plastering, carpentry,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
skilled laborers can be contracted even if they do not have the license but meet the&#13;
requirements of PERT-PCR;&#13;
(h)  in project planning, implementation, monitoring and accountability;&#13;
(i)  collect quantitative and qualitative data throughout the life of the pilot. Continuation and&#13;
expansion of the project depends on the findings in the pilot and accurate data collection is&#13;
therefore essential to be used in deciding on the future of the project. In the pilot areas a&#13;
base line survey must be conducted to highlight current transport patterns and&#13;
infrastructure condition. Other forms of data needs would be identified as the project&#13;
progresses;&#13;
(j) develop of monitoring indicators, monitoring of the sub-projects and provision of monthly&#13;
progress reports. Indicators must not only determine the performance of the sub-projects,&#13;
but should include indicators that determine the impact of sub-projects on beneficiaries.&#13;
This will enable assessors to analyze adequacy of coverage, project selection criteria,&#13;
supervision procedures, and other aspects relating to the efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
sub-projects;&#13;
(k)  in close collaboration with PERT-PCR, develop a manual on the construction methods,&#13;
quality control procedures and standards of materials and application, based on locally&#13;
available materials and labor intensive techniques. It should provide methodologies for&#13;
assessment of conditions on the ground and associated standard designs that have been&#13;
developed in consultation with the communities, and propose reference prices with some&#13;
straightforward explanations about its calculations (unit prices and quantities). The&#13;
manual should also include precise and well defined rules for the selection of sub-projects&#13;
which have not been selected ex-ante, and provide project specific standardized contracts&#13;
for the procurement of goods and services, or if not feasible, provide guidance in&#13;
establishing such contracts. The manual should be brief, preferably not exceeding 20&#13;
pages, and must provide clear, step by step flow charts for preparation of project&#13;
proposals illustrated by pictograms, etc., and intended for use by communities in the field;&#13;
(1)  assist PERT-PCR in developing of training programs that build requisite skills within the&#13;
community necessary for project related activities; and&#13;
(m) inform PERT-PCR in writing of its decision to sub-contract services it cannot perform&#13;
itself PERT-PCR has to approve the method and process through which the&#13;
subcontracting may be achieved and will have a final say in the selection of such&#13;
subcontractors.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
6.    The consultant is responsible for steering and facilitating implementation of the projects.&#13;
The project itself however should be implemented on the ground by the participating community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
The following is suggested as a guide to streamline the start-up process; from here however the&#13;
consultant is encouraged to use the most efficient process as identified by the consultant itself&#13;
(a) meet with PERT-PCR to receive information on the geographic location of the 'main'&#13;
RRRMP pilot projects; responsible engineers in the Department of Cusco - Ing. A. Guerra&#13;
and in the Department of Huancavelica - Ing. A. Rodriguez,&#13;
(b) review the relevant information from consultants (Final Report Study for Formulation of a&#13;
Rural Road Program) on the NMT component which gives an inventory of potential NMT&#13;
paths in the Department of Huancavelica;&#13;
(c) determine in conjunction with PERT-PCR possible candidate communities within the five&#13;
selected pilot areas,&#13;
(d) travel to identified candidate communities; use universally acceptable participatory&#13;
approaches to present the project to the communities ensuring full participation; identify at&#13;
this stage the potential community committees or other bodies for project implementation.&#13;
In terms of institutional organization, in general there are two levels of authority: i)at the&#13;
District level; the Alcalde; ii) at the community level, the presidente of each community&#13;
who reports to the alcalde. It is envisaged that participation and implementation occur at&#13;
the Community level as identified above. The Alcalde of the District should be involved,&#13;
but decision making should take preferably place at the Community level;&#13;
(e) request the community to prioritize its needs in NMT and to indicate its commitment in&#13;
terms of labor; and&#13;
(f) determine the communities institutional capacity for project implementation, and where&#13;
lacking, develop such capacity with applicable technical assistance.&#13;
Prioritization of sub-projects&#13;
7.    The communities will be responsible for prioritizing their own needs and putting forward&#13;
proposals for funding. A certain amount of funding will be made available (possibly on the basis&#13;
of population) to communities for NMT improvements and the communities will prioritize their&#13;
needs within this framework. The consultant will assist the communities determine possible&#13;
options and their related costs. An efficient application of funds should be ensured through this or&#13;
a similar methodology.&#13;
Contract with a Community Group&#13;
8.    A sample contract "Contract with a Community Group" is available from PERT-PCR.&#13;
The project would finance 80 percent of the total cost estimated by PERT-PCR for the proposed&#13;
works based on standard designs and unit costs. This would fully cover the cost of materials,&#13;
equipment and skilled labor, while most of the unskilled labor would be contributed by the&#13;
community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
Estimated Consultant's Inputs&#13;
9.    The services of the consultant will be required for pilot of the project with a duration of 18&#13;
(eighteen) months. It is envisaged that the following professional inputs are provided by a 'core&#13;
team':&#13;
- an engineer (6 person/months)&#13;
- a sociologist (6 person/months)&#13;
- a promoter (12 person/months)&#13;
The same 'core team' of consultants should be responsible for all five NMT pilot projects. The&#13;
reason for this is to allow for consistency and to facilitate the drawing of conclusions for the pilot&#13;
as a whole. It will also give opportunity to determine issues that arise differently in different sub-&#13;
project areas. Furthermore, this 'core team' would be supported by a field worker in each of the&#13;
five pilot sites, organizing community assemblies, collecting data, etc. (5x18 manmonths).&#13;
Reporting Requirements&#13;
10.   In order to track and monitor the progress of the pilot project, the consultant will submit&#13;
the following reports to the PERT-PCR.&#13;
(a)  Inception Report - This report must be submitted within 30 days after the starting date of&#13;
the assignment. The report should outline the details of the methodology and strategy to&#13;
be adopted to achieve the scope of work together with a list of key personnel and their&#13;
work program.&#13;
(b)  Interim Report - This report must be submitted 6 months after the starting date for&#13;
review by PERT-PCR containing: (i) the results of initial activities with preliminary&#13;
conclusions and recommendations; (ii) details of work program for the immediate twelve&#13;
months; (iii) details of key issues that need to be resolved to ensure smooth running of the&#13;
project; (iv) the standard design manual to be included in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
(c)  Quarterly Reports - These reports to be issued one month after the end of each quarter&#13;
will contain a summary of the activities performed during the quarter together with the&#13;
conclusions and guidelines for the next quarter.&#13;
(d)  Draft Final Report - A Draft Final Report will be submitted 17 months after the starting&#13;
date giving a summary of all the works performed and presenting all findings, conclusions&#13;
and recommendations as are related to the objectives and scope of work defined for this&#13;
project. PERT-PCR will discuss the project with the consultant and make amendments&#13;
and additions where necessary, including the observations submitted by the Banks.&#13;
(e)  Final Report - The Final Report will be submitted within six weeks of the conclusion of&#13;
the discussions with PERT-PCR and submission of the comments of the Banks,&#13;
incorporating necessary modifications to the Draft Final Report covering all aspects of the&#13;
project.&#13;

ANNEX 5&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
1.    This component consists of: i) technical assistance to improve planning and management&#13;
of rural roads at the national and local levels. This technical assistance will be supported by two&#13;
policy and institutional studies on local road administration practices and rural road financing; ii)&#13;
technical assistance to develop micro-enterprises for execution of routine maintenance using work&#13;
methods tailored to the institutional and financial capacity of rural municipalities; and iii) a&#13;
package of technical assistance and training services to strengthen the local road construction&#13;
industry, to be offered on a voluntary basis to local contractors and micro-enterprises who will be&#13;
awarded contracts under the road rehabilitation components, and on-the-job training to local&#13;
engineering firms and beneficiaries on the preparation of feasibility studies and technical project&#13;
proposals. The project would also finance training in Peru and abroad for key staff from MTC,&#13;
PERT-PCR and local governments participating in project activities.&#13;
2.    Attachments 1 and 2 include the terms of reference for the technical assistance in rural&#13;
road planning and management and for the development of microenterprises for rural roads&#13;
maintenance, respectively. Selection of the consultants will start in September 1995, to ensure the&#13;
consultant services can be deployed from the beginning of project implementation.&#13;
3 .    PERT-PCR will prepare final terms of reference for the two studies on Local Road&#13;
Administration Practices and Rural Road Financing by end-September 1996, to take into account&#13;
the development of the Government's decentralization policy, which at this stage is not clearly&#13;
defined. The consultants will be engaged by end-December 1996, for about six to eight months to&#13;
complete the studies and discuss their recommendations with Government. The design of&#13;
sustainable mechanisms for the financing of rural roads maintenance and the streamlining of&#13;
contract administration practices at the local level, are foreseen as major outcomes of the project.&#13;
The studies will provide the basic recommendations for Government to formulate the strategies&#13;
needed in a manner consistent with its decentralization agenda, and prepare the action plans to&#13;
implement these strategies in reasonable time. The strategies and action plans will be thoroughly&#13;
discussed and agreed upon with IDB and the Bank at the project third annual review. At that&#13;
time, the review will determine the degree of success in achieving the project development&#13;
objectives, and subject to actual performance, decide whether to move ahead with the second&#13;
phase of the six-year program.&#13;

PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Esquema de Terminos de Referencia para Asistencia T&amp;enica en Planeaci6n y Gesti6n de&#13;
Caminos Rurales&#13;
Antecedentes&#13;
1.    La red de carreteras departamentales y vecinales del Perfi alcanza una longitud cercana a&#13;
los 57,000 km., de los cuales 3% son caminos pavimentados, 12% son caminos de grava, 25%&#13;
caminos de tierra y 60% son trochas carrozables. Todos ellos se caracterizan por el alto deterioro&#13;
producto de la falta de mantenimiento. Desde 1991 a la fecha el gobierno ha iniciado la&#13;
progresiva recuperaci6n del sistema vial del Perui. Habiendo completado la rehabilitaci6n de las&#13;
dos columnas vertebrales de dicho sistema --las carreteras Panamericana y Central-- existe un&#13;
marcado interes por parte del gobierno por consolidar el sistema de transporte integrando la red&#13;
vial nacional con las vias departamentales y vecinales que sirven a las zonas mas deprimidas y&#13;
necesitadas de infraestructura basica que propicie su desarrollo.&#13;
2.    Con este fin, el gobierno ha preparado el Proyecto de Rehabilitaci6n y Mantenimiento de&#13;
Caminos Rurales (PRMCR), que contara con financiamiento conjunto del Banco Mundial y del&#13;
Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo. El proyecto cubrira los departamentos de Ancash,&#13;
Apurimac, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Cusco y Huancavelica inicialmente, para extenderse a los&#13;
departamentos de Huanuco, Junin, Madre de Dios, Pasco, Puno y San Martin, a partir de 1997.&#13;
Este proyecto busca rehabilitar redes de caminos secundarios y rurales en la sierra del Peru, de&#13;
manera de restablecer las condiciones de transitabilidad y acceso a las zonas rurales mas&#13;
deprimidas. Las obras de rehabilitaci6n contempladas permiten emplear metodos de uso intensivo&#13;
de mano de obra en condiciones econ6micas y sin afectar la calidad o durabilidad de las mismas,&#13;
lo que permitira generar empleo durante los periodos de escasa actividad agricola. Asimismo, a&#13;
fin de que el impacto del programa sea mayor, los caminos seleccionados constituiran "proyectos&#13;
integrados", es decir, estaran agrupados en redes que aseguren una adecuada comunicaci6n de las&#13;
comunidades rurales con los centros de actividad econ6mica. Por ende, el programa incluira&#13;
tambien la rehabilitaci6n de los caminos departamentales --y nacionales si fuera el caso--&#13;
necesarios para proporcionar esta vinculaci6n. Se espera que esta estrategia tendra un mayor&#13;
impacto en el desarrollo de la regi6n que la rehabilitaci6n de caminos en forma aislada.&#13;
3.    Los municipios son responsables por la gesti6n de los caminos rurales. Sin embargo, la&#13;
debilidad institucional y falta de recursos que padece gran parte de los municipios de los&#13;
departamentos arriba mencionados, ha impedido que en la prActica desarrollen estas&#13;
responsabilidades. Es dificil para el gobierno nacional atender en forma directa estas redes y en&#13;
particular el mantenimiento de los caminos rurales alejados, y de cantidad indefinida, que&#13;
constituyen la red vial que sirve de soporte al desarrollo rural. El proyecto por consiguiente,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
juntamente con la ejecuci6n de las obras canalizara recursos de asistencia tecnica dirigidos a los&#13;
municipios provinciales y distritales, con el fin de prepararlos para que en un tiempo razonable&#13;
puedan Ilevar a cabo con exito la gesti6n de las redes viales que les competen.&#13;
4.    PERT-PCR desea contratar servicios de consultoria y asistencia tecnica para la ejecuci6n&#13;

municipios provinciales en la areas en las que se desarrolla el proyecto y su capacidad de&#13;
coordinaci6n e integraci6n con los municipios distritales que integran la jurisdicci6n&#13;
provincial. Este diagn6stico permitira elaborar el perfil institucional de la provincia,&#13;
clasificar los municipios seguin su potencial capacidad de gesti6n y determinar sus&#13;
necesidades de organizaci6n, de capacitacion tecnica y de vinculaci6n institucional.&#13;
(d)  Con base en las tareas anteriores, desarrollar modelos de organizaci6n, programas de&#13;
fortalecimiento institucional y de capacitaci6n tecnica, adecuados para los diversos tipos&#13;
de municipios cubiertos bajo el proyecto.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
(e)  Preparar los Planes de Acci6n Institucional a ser acordados entre PERT-PCR y los&#13;
municipios provinciales participantes en el proyecto. Estos planes incluiran los objetivos&#13;
concretos propuestos, las acciones a lievar a cabo por el municipio, por PERT-PCR y por&#13;
otros organismos de capacitaci6n con financiamiento del proyecto, y los tiempos en que se&#13;
concretarin las mismas, de manera de permitir un adecuado seguimiento. Los planes&#13;
contemplarin tambien la adopci6n de los diversos elementos de gesti6n y tecnicos que se&#13;
indican mas abajo por parte de los municipios, y que seran desarrollados en el transcurso&#13;
de la asistencia tecnica. El seguimiento directo de estos planes estara a cargo de las&#13;
UEDs, pero el consultor efectuara una evaluaci6n de control cada tres meses.&#13;
(f)  Preparar lineamientos y trmninos de referencia para la formulaci6n de planes viales&#13;
provinciales. Estos planes promoveran (i) la participaci6n de los municipios distritales&#13;
para la concepci6n de proyectos integrados, (2) el empleo sistematico de los mecanismos&#13;
de consulta y evaluaci6n de las comunidades y (3) la adopci6n de una estrategia a nivel de&#13;
provincia para el mantenimiento permanente de los caminos bajo su jurisdicci6n.&#13;
(g)  Desarrollar un sistema de inventario y seguimiento de la red de caminos rurales acorde con&#13;
la capacidad institucional de los municipios provinciales que deberan implementarlo. El&#13;
disefno del sistema y los instructivos elaborados por el consultor tendran en cuenta que los&#13;
mismos seran empleados por los municipios por lo que deberan adecuarse a los medios&#13;
tecnicos y financieros de los mismos.&#13;
(h)  Desarrollar sistemas de presupuestaci6n, costos y seguimiento de obras viales para su&#13;
implementaci6n en los municipios. El sistema de costos permitira dar cuenta de los costos&#13;
de todos los componentes, y en particular efectuar una cuidadosa evaluaci6n de los costos&#13;
reales de la administraci6n directa. Los sistemas de gesti6n del PERT-PCR se ajustaran&#13;
para su presentaci6n y utilizaci6n por parte de los organismos municipales.&#13;
Perfil de la empresa a ser contratada, cronograma e informes&#13;
7.    La empresa a ser contratada debera ser una consultora especializada en ingenieria vial&#13;

PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Esquema de Terminos de Referencia para Desarrollar Microempresas para Mantenimiento&#13;
Rutinario de Caminos Rurales en Peru&#13;
Antecedentes&#13;
1.    La red de carreteras departamentales y vecinales del Peru alcanza una longitud cercana a&#13;
los 57,000 km., de los cuales 3% son caminos pavimentados, 12% son caminos de grava, 25%&#13;
caminos de tierra y 60% son trochas carrozables. Todos ellos se caracterizan por el alto deterioro&#13;
producto de la falta de mantenimiento. Desde 1991 a la fecha el gobiemo ha iniciado la&#13;
progresiva recuperaci6n del sistema vial del Peruf. Habiendo completado la rehabilitaci6n de las&#13;
dos columnas vertebrales de dicho sistema --las carreteras Panamericana y Central-- existe un&#13;
marcado interes por parte del gobierno por consolidar el sistema de transporte integrando la red&#13;
vial nacional con las vias departamentales y vecinales que sirven a las zonas mas deprimidas y&#13;
necesitadas de infraestructura basica que propicie su desarrollo. Central a todos estos esfuerzos,&#13;
es el establecer los mecanismos que permitan el mantenimiento permanente de las vias&#13;
rehabilitadas, de manera que los beneficios derivados de las inversiones realizadas sean sostenibles&#13;
a largo plazo. Con este fin, el gobierno ha preparado el Proyecto de Rehabilitaci6n y&#13;
Mantenimiento de Caminos Rurales (PRMCR) que contara con financiamiento conjunto del&#13;
Banco Mundial y del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo.&#13;
2.    Es dificil para el gobierno nacional atender en forma directa el mantenimiento de los&#13;
caminos rurales alejados, y de cantidad indefinida, que constituyen la red vial que sirve de soporte&#13;
al desarrollo rural. Asimismo, en general las soluciones tradicionales aplicadas por los gobiernos&#13;
municipales han tenido poco exito para atender en forma eficiente y oportuna el mantenimiento de&#13;
dichos caminos. Esto ha llevado a recomendar una mayor participaci6n del sector privado, en la&#13;
forma de contratos de mantenimiento y, en particular, a traves de la conformaci6n de&#13;
microempresas y/o comites de mantenimiento constituidos por los propios beneficiarios de los&#13;
caminos. Existe en la sierra peruana una larga tradici6n de participaci6n comunitaria y se espera&#13;
que el involucramiento directo de las comunidades contribuira a arraigar una "cultura de&#13;
mantenimiento". Por otro lado, la creaci6n de microempresas para atender servicios piblicos, en&#13;
el marco de una estrategia de privatizaci6n social de algunos servicios que actualmente brinda el&#13;
Estado, es una iniciativa que se viene ejecutando en Peru6, asi como en otros paises de la regi6n,&#13;
en forma exitosa y con la ventaja de generar empleo estable entre la poblaci6n mAs deprimida.&#13;
3.    Precisamente, uno de los componentes del Proyecto de Rehabilitaci6n y Mantenimiento de&#13;
Caminos Rurales contempla el desarrollo de microempresas y la organizaci6n de comit6s de&#13;
mantenimiento a fin de proporcionar un mantenimiento rutinario y de emergencia a los caminos&#13;
rehabilitados bajo el proyecto. Frente a otros esquemas, el uso de las microempresas tiene&#13;
algunas ventajas comparativas para el desarrollo posterior de las Areas rurales: las microempresas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
pueden actuar de catalizadores para otras iniciativas de desarrollo local, como puntos de contacto&#13;
para la extensi6n de servicios, y pueden movilizar recursos auin sin explotar para las operaciones&#13;
de las comunidades locales. Esto, a su vez, puede alentar a los gobiernos locales a hacer uso de&#13;
las microempresas. Son objetivos especificos de este componente del proyecto:&#13;
(a)  Establecer microempresas que puedan atender en forma eficiente, oportuna y permanente&#13;
las tareas de mantenimiento rutinario de los caminos vecinales y departamentales&#13;
rehabilitados bajo el proyecto (o rehabilitados por la DGC u otras instituciones en las&#13;
mismas areas donde actua el proyecto);&#13;
(b)  Generar nuevos puestos de trabajo y destrezas entre los habitantes de bajos ingresos del&#13;
area rural del pais, contribuyendo a disminuir el desempleo;&#13;
(c)  Conformar grupos con mentalidad socio-empresarial, brindando la oportunidad a los&#13;
miembros directos de las microempresas de que sean artifices de su propio progreso&#13;
econ6mico y al mismo tiempo, por su efecto multiplicador, puedan convertirse en un&#13;
elemento dinamico para el desarrollo local y regional; y&#13;
(d)  Promover la participaci6n comunitaria en la identificaci6n y analisis de problemas viales y&#13;
en la implementaci6n de sus soluciones, vinculando la comunidad al desarrollo local y&#13;
regional de tal forma que se tome consciencia de que las vias han sido construidas para&#13;
beneficio comuin y deben ser conservadas por la comunidad con apoyo de los gobiemos&#13;
locales.&#13;
Objetivos&#13;
4.    El prop6sito de la presente asistencia tecnica es desarrollar los procedimientos y mecanismos&#13;
para conformar y emplear microempresas y/o comites organizados para el mantenimiento rutinario de&#13;
los caminos vecinales y departamentales, y poner en funcionamiento un cierto numero de ellas para&#13;
atender los carninos y redes viales seleccionados por el MTC para la fase inicial. Estos trabajos en el&#13;
campo permitiran validar las recomendaciones antes de extenderlas a otras areas del proyecto. Las&#13;
microempresas y/o comites organizados seran contratados en forma directa por el MTC (con&#13;
financiamniento del PRMCR) para llevar a cabo los programas de mantenimiento rutinario en el&#13;
contexto del proyecto, hasta tanto tales contrataciones entren en funcionarniento normal y puedan ser&#13;
transferidas para su administraci6n por parte de los gobiemos municipales. Basicamente, se esperan&#13;
cinco productos de la consultoria:&#13;
(a)  Definici6n de las bases legales, administrativas y financieras bajo las cuales deberan&#13;
conformarse las microempresas o los comites organizados de mantenimiento vial, teniendo&#13;
en cuenta las distintas alternativas juridicas que existen en el pais para el reconocimiento&#13;
de las mismas, y sus ventajas y desventajas segun las condiciones sociales, econ6micas o&#13;
geograficas de las areas donde seran implementadas bajo el programa.&#13;
(b) Disenio de los procedimientos tecnicos y administrativos para la programaci6n, ejecuci6n,&#13;
supervisi6n y gesti6n de los trabajos de mantenimiento rutinario a contratar con microempresas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
y/o comites organizados para mantenimiento, proporcionando todos los manuales tecnicos y&#13;
operativos, modelos de contrato, etc., necesarios para la implementaci6n del sistema.&#13;
(c)  Creaci6n y puesta en funcionamiento de las microempresas necesarias para atender las&#13;
necesidades de mantenimiento de la red de caminos vecinales y/o departamentales piloto&#13;
seleccionada por el MTC, con el fin de evaluar la factibilidad del esquema y procedimnientos&#13;
propuestos.&#13;
(d)  Formulaci6n del sistema de seguimiento y control del programa de microempresas,&#13;
identificando el arreglo institucional mas adecuado para llevar a cabo la gesti6n-seguimiento del&#13;
programa (incluyendo indicadores de gesti6n), su posterior traspaso a los gobiernos&#13;
municipales, asi como la capacitaci6n y asistencia tecnica que en forma continua ha de&#13;
proporcionarse para apoyar esta iniciativa en el largo plazo.&#13;
(e) Formulaci6n de la estrategia para extender el desarrollo de los esquemas y sistemas propuestos&#13;
al resto de las areas geograficas cubiertas por el proyecto, incluyendo la metodologia y&#13;
terminos de referencia para promotores o entidades a emplear para flevar a cabo la&#13;
conformaci6n de las microempresas.&#13;
Alcance de la Asistencia&#13;
5.    Con el fin de alcanzar los objetivos arriba indicados, el consultor llevara a cabo las siguientes&#13;
tareas en coordinaci6n con la unidad ejecutora del PRMCR:&#13;
(a)  Identificar las distintas alternativas juridicas y administrativas que existen en el pais para el&#13;
reconocimiento de las microempresas, estableciendo sus ventajas y desventajas y las&#13;
pautas socio-econ6micas (disponibilidad de mano de obra, periodos de interferencia con&#13;
actividad agricola, idiosincracia propia de las comunidades de la regi6n, etc.) que pueden&#13;
condicionar la viabilidad de las mismas. Las recomendaciones seran validadas en el campo&#13;
con base en un diagn6stico participativo de los problemas viales distritales y comunales, y&#13;
su interes en la formaci6n de microempresas de mantenimiento, de acuerdo con la&#13;
metodologia para analisis participativo incluida en el Manual de Operaciones del PRCMR.&#13;
Donde se vea necesario, el consultor propondra arreglos organizacionales altemativos&#13;
(empresas comunales o multicomunales, comites locales, consejos de desarrollo distrital,&#13;
etc.) para el mantenimiento de los caminos rehabilitados bajo el PRMCR.&#13;
(b)  Con base en la tarea anterior, definir el marco legal, administrativo y financiero bajo el cual&#13;
operaran los esquemas propuestos, preparar la documentaci6n de apoyo necesaria para&#13;
constituir las microempresas u otras organizaciones altemativas recomendadas, y determinar&#13;
que entidades con presencia nacional o regional estan en condiciones de desarrollar actividades&#13;
de financiamniento de capital inicial, capacitaci6n, asesoria y asistencia tecnica en forma&#13;
continua, con el fin de apoyar esta iniciativa en el largo plazo. El consultor recomendara las&#13;
politicas en materia de salarios y distribuci6n de excedentes, gesti6n de personal, puestos y&#13;
funciones, y manejo contable de las nuevas organizaciones, y explorara la conveniencia de&#13;
implementar un fondo rotativo operado por una entidad financiera reconocida en el contexto&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
de los programas del gobiemo para apoyo a microempresas, u otros mecanismos de&#13;
canalizaci6n de recursos, que permitan financiar el capital de trabajo inicial y los activos fijos&#13;
minimos necesarios para la operaci6n de las microempresas. De ser necesario, el consultor&#13;
propondra las condiciones financieras (tasas de inter6s, periodo de repago, periodo de gracia,&#13;
requerimientos de colateral) de acuerdo a las leyes y a la experiencia del pais con programas&#13;
similares. El consultor propondra tambien los mecanismos de participaci6n y coordinaci6n&#13;
entre los agentes involucrados, incluyendo PERT-PCR como delegado del MTC, los gobiernos&#13;
locales, y agentes pu.blicos y privados involucrados en el programa.&#13;
(c)  Disefiar los t6rminos para la contrataci6n directa de microempresas y/o comites organizados de&#13;
mantenimiento, definiendo las actividades tipicas a ejecutar, costos unitarios y recursos&#13;
necesarios para su ejecuci6n, los procedimientos para la programaci6n, ejecuci6n, supervisi6n y&#13;
valoraci6n de los trabajos de mantenimiento, asi como la distribuci6n de responsabilidades en la&#13;
ejecuci6n de las actividades mencionadas. El consultor analizara informaci6n existente en Peru&#13;
y obtenida de experiencias con programas similares realizadas en otros paises, con el fin de&#13;
desarrollar todos los instrumentos necesarios para la puesta en marcha y operaci6n del&#13;
programa de mantenimiento con microempresas u organizaciones similares, incluyendo el&#13;
disefio de las operaciones de mantenimiento, las especificaciones tecnicas, la organizaci6n y el&#13;
analisis de costos y tiempos de ejecuci6n de los trabajos.&#13;
(d)  Preparar normas de ejecuci6n, de cantidad y calidad, modelos de contrato, y manuales tecnicos&#13;
y operativos necesarios para apoyar la gesti6n del programa. El consultor establecera las&#13;
normas correspondientes a las actividades a incluir en los contratos teniendo en cuenta (1) las&#13;
condiciones prevalecientes (uso, disefio y topografia de la via) en los tramos de caminos rurales&#13;
rehabilitados por el PRMCR, sin que esto signifique Ilegar al nivel de detalle de un expediente&#13;
tecnico, (2) las recomendaciones de estudios similares realizados en el pais (e.g., Plan Piloto de&#13;
Mantenimiento Rutinario financiado con el Proyecto de Rehabilitaci6n de Transporte, estudios&#13;
y programas realizados por ONGs), y (3) la experiencia de personal de mantenimiento del&#13;
MTC. En la preparaci6n de los manuales para uso de las microempresas u organizaciones&#13;
alternativas se pondrA especial enfasis en los aspectos didacticos, haciendo uso de graficos y&#13;
lenguaje apropiado para las comunidades a las que estan dirigidos, proponiendo formas&#13;
sencillas de preparar los materiales, ejecutar y controlar la calidad de los trabajos con base en&#13;
practicas convenientemente adaptadas al medio local. Los manuales se ajustaran a los criterios&#13;
y estandares ambientales incorporados en el Manual de Operaciones del PRMCR.&#13;
(e)  Promover la formaci6n de microempresas o arreglos organizacionales altemativos en las areas&#13;
encomendadas por el MTC para la presente consultoria, teniendo en cuenta los resultados del&#13;
diagn6stico participativo y analisis socio-econ6nico realizado bajo la tarea (a) y las propuestas&#13;
formuladas bajo las tareas subsiguientes. Esta tarea comenzarA con el acercamiento a las&#13;
comunidades, diagn6stico de sus potencialidades, detecci6n de posibles interesados, definici6n&#13;
de los criterios para selecci6n de los candidatos que integraran las microempresas y, a traves de&#13;
la guia proporcionada por los promotores seleccionados o empleados por el consultor,&#13;
desarrollo de un proceso de integraci6n que culminara con la conformaci6n de la nueva&#13;
organizaci6n.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
(f3  Asegurar el establecimiento de las microempresas u organizaciones altemativas asegurando su&#13;
puesta en funcionamiento. A tal efecto, seleccionara en concertaci6n con los participantes de&#13;
la microempresa u organizaci6n de mantenimiento, la forma de constituci6n legal mas&#13;
apropriada para cada organizaci6n de mantenimiento, y concertara en representacion del MTC&#13;
la aprobaci6n/reconocimiento respectivo por parte de las instancias comunales, municipales y&#13;
nacionales si fuera necesario. Para los tramos de carninos encomendados por PERT-PCR, el&#13;
consultor presentara (1) el arreglo organizacional recomendado y caracteristicas de la&#13;
organizaci6n que se harA cargo del mantenimiento rutinario, (2) una definici6n de las tareas a&#13;
realizar, (3) un detalle del programa a ejecutar, los costos de mantenimiento por kil6metro y de&#13;
inversi6n inicial en las microempresas, (4) una proforma del contrato anual entre la&#13;
organizaci6n y PERT, y (5) una estimaci6n de las necesidades de capacitaci6n.&#13;
(g)  Asistir en la consolidaci6n de las microempresas u organizaciones altemativas formadas de&#13;
manera que estas puedan desenvolverse con autonomia. En esta fase, que se prolongara entre&#13;
6 y 9 meses, el consultor actuara sobre pedido, cuando los grupos directivos de las&#13;
nmicroempresas, los entidades comunales o municipales, o el propio PERT-PCR requieran de&#13;
sus servicios especificos. En este sentido, el consultor proporcionara capacitaci6n tecnica y&#13;
administrativa a las microempresas u organizaciones altemativas constituidas y asistira por lo&#13;
menos por un periodo de seis meses en la puesta en marcha, administraci6n y gesti6n de las&#13;
mismas bajo el programa de mantenimiento.&#13;
(h)  Establecer un sistema de seguimiento y evaluaci6n de la gesti6n del programa de&#13;
mantenimiento vial con microempresas que permita (a) revisar peri6dicamente el progreso del&#13;
componente, (b) medir los impactos en empleo, destrezas y nivel de vida de los socios de las&#13;
micro-empresas u otras organizaciones de mantenirniento, y (c) evaluar la efectividad de las&#13;
rnicroempresas u otras organizaciones en llevar a cabo los trabajos de mantenimiento. El&#13;
sistema debera disefiarse teniendo en cuenta su fiutura utilizaci6n por los organismos&#13;
municipales.&#13;
(i)  Preparar un plan para difusi6n y promoci6n del programa y sus objetivos entre las&#13;
organizaciones comunales, locales, regionales y otras instituciones publicas y privadas&#13;
involucradas en la gesti6n vial. El consultor elaborara trmrinos de referencia para el&#13;
alistamiento de promotores, ONGs u otros organismos con ventajas comparativas, a contratar&#13;
para la constituci6n de microempresas de mantenimiento en otras areas del pais. Asimismo,&#13;
propondra recomendaciones respecto a la estructura institucional e inter-administrativa para la&#13;
futura gesti6n del programa por los gobiemos municipales. Finalmente, el consultor&#13;
desarrollarA manuales para capacitaci6n de (1) promotores, y (2) microempresas u&#13;
organizaciones alternativas.&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABELIATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
1.    There are no major or significant environmental issues associated with the proposed&#13;
project. As the project entails mainly rehabilitation and maintenance, of existing roads the direct&#13;
impact of project works on natural ecosystems and right of ways are of less importance.&#13;
Proposed roads to be rehabilitated are already in consolidated areas in which indirect impacts have&#13;
already being exerted for many decades; therefore, additional pressures on surrounding natural&#13;
areas are expected to be negligible.&#13;
2.    However, there is evidence of important negative environmental impacts along existing&#13;
rural roads such as increased erosion, slope stability and drainage obstruction. These problems&#13;
will be addressed in the present project and the appropriate mitigation measures identified for the&#13;
design of the rehabilitation works, which will include all opportunities for environmental&#13;
enhancement along the corridors and the population settled in the area.&#13;
Environmental and Social Setting&#13;
3.    Most of the rural roads included in the Project are located between elevations of 1,100 to&#13;
3,700 meters above sea level. The terrain presents typical conditions of the high Andes with&#13;
rocky and gravel formations and annual precipitation under 1,000 mm, with some areas going as&#13;
high as 2,000 mm.&#13;
4.    Most rural roads were built without adequate design standards. Road surface grades are&#13;
made directly on natural terrain cuts, with inadequate treatment of lateral slopes and insufficient&#13;
or non-existent drainage systems. Inadequate construction techniques and the absence of&#13;
maintenance practices have led to increasingly deteriorating conditions of the rural road network.&#13;
5.    An environmental survey of 17 typical rural roads included in the Pilot Program (covering&#13;
approximately 252 km) concluded that: i) about 47% of the roads do not have lateral drains or&#13;
intercepting ditches and the existing ones are either silted and obstructed or inoperative; ii) about&#13;
76% of surveyed roads present flooding or groundwater table problems; and iii) about 64% of&#13;
roads present slope and embankment instability.&#13;
6.    These problems are further exacerbated by improper cultivation practices, slash and burn&#13;
techniques in steep slopes, and a lack of environmental awareness in the rural population. This&#13;
situation in turn exerts negative impacts on the existing rural road network causing frequent&#13;
landslides and obstructions in specific areas thus increasing maintenance problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
7.    The project is located in the rural area of the Peruvian Andes, where about 30 percent of&#13;
the country's population lives. About 67% of the sierra population is poor and more than 50% is&#13;
extremely poor. Around 25% of the rural poor and 40% of the extremely poor belong to&#13;
indigenous groups. The main economic activity in the area of influence of most rural roads is&#13;
agriculture, with migratory patterns in specific areas; many of the production systems are&#13;
unsustainable which has caused a great deal of deforestation and soil degradation in those areas.&#13;
8.    Due to the violence of guerrilla warfare during the last two decades, the rural population&#13;
was displaced to the urban centers (mainly Lima); however, as security conditions are improving&#13;
in rural areas, the rural poor and indigenous groups have been returning to their previous lands.&#13;
The proposed project would initially cover six departments that rank highest in rural poverty. The&#13;
project investments aim to improve access of the existing communities to a well-integrated rural&#13;
road network to support poverty alleviation and rural development.&#13;
Institutional Aspects&#13;
9.    MTC's capacity to address environmental issues associated with road projects is still weak,&#13;
in spite of major efforts carried out under the Transport Rehabilitation project. The&#13;
Environmental Unit in MTC has not been consolidated and there is a need for greater commitment&#13;
from the Ministry to reorganize and strengthen this unit. Most environmental activities for road&#13;
projects are undertaken by an ad-hoc environmental unit working within PERT-PRT. The&#13;
strengthening of the institutional set up and of the environmental unit in particular is being&#13;
supported by the Bank on-going Transport Rehabilitation Project and the two IDB funded road&#13;
projects. With regard to the rural road sector, the project finances technical assistance for PERT-&#13;
PCR in, among other areas, environmental practices. Table 1 below shows the various&#13;
environmental aspects cover under the institutional development component of the project. More&#13;
details on the scope of the technical assistance programs are given in the terms of reference&#13;
outlined in Annex 5.&#13;
Project Environmental Components&#13;
10.   Environmental issues and concerns have been integrated in the design of the project.&#13;
Instead of devising an independent environmental component, all project sub-components and&#13;
activities will introduce appropriate environmental language or terms of reference to: (i) carry out&#13;
environmental screening of proposed sub-projects; (ii) carry out environmental diagnosis and&#13;
identification of environmental enhancement opportunities along existing roads to be rehabilitated;&#13;
(iii) supervise the compliance with environmental requirements for project design and&#13;
construction. Environmental guidelines for rural road rehabilitation and maintenance will be part&#13;
of all bidding documents and contracts. These manuals will be designed and tested with&#13;
community participation in order to ensure appropriate language and applicability of proposed&#13;
environmental measures.&#13;
11.   The project will provide technical assistance to all the different actors involved in project&#13;
design and implementation. This includes environmental management of roads and construction&#13;
of critical environmental mitigation measures. Finally, the project will finance an environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
awareness program in the communities benefiting from the project. Table I summarizes the&#13;
enviromnental design of the project.&#13;
12.   The community participation strategy adopted for the project will further enhance the&#13;
positive environmental and social impacts of the project such as: (i) providing better access to&#13;
basic economic and health services for the rural poor; (ii) generating sustainable employrnent&#13;
activities through the support to community based microenterprises; and (iii) improving&#13;
environmental conditions in the rural communities.&#13;

Project Design                        TORs for technical design include environmental aspects according&#13;
to results of initial screening and diagnosis.&#13;
Rehabilitation/Maintenance Works      Environmental guidelines for rehabilitation and maintenance&#13;
contractors are part of bidding documents and contracts. An&#13;
Environmental Manual, specifically designed for rural roads and&#13;
with participation of communities will be completed and approved&#13;
by September 30, 1996&#13;
Supervision and Performance Audits    Terms of reference for supervision of works include specific&#13;
requirements as to compliance with environmental specifications.&#13;
Bi-annual technical and performance audits include assessing&#13;
compliance with environmental guidelines and specifications.&#13;
Institutional Development:            Includes (1) defining environmental policies and procedures, (2)&#13;
*  Technical assistance for rural road  assisting PERT-PCR in screening and supervising subprojects, (3)&#13;

ANNEX 8&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Set-Up and Project Organization&#13;
Legal Status and Organizational Structure of PERT-PCR&#13;
1.    MTC will have overall responsibility for project coordination and implementation. Actual&#13;
implementation will be assigned to a specialized unit, the Proyecto Especial de Rehabilitaci6n de&#13;
Transporte-Programa Caminos Rurales (PERT-PCR), created by Ministerial Decree No. 315-95&#13;
of July 19, 1995. PERT is presently implementing both IDB and World Bank projects under the&#13;
Transport Rehabilitation Program (Programa Rehabilitaci6n Transporte, PRT). The decree&#13;
establishes the two programs with the same status, each one led by one Executive Director who&#13;
directly reports to the Viceminister of Transport, and staffed according to the specific skills mix&#13;
required for project implementation. The PRT portion of PERT with responsibilities in the&#13;
rehabilitation of the national road network, will be transferred to the Superintendency of National&#13;
Transport Infrastructure once this new organization is established. The PCR portion, however,&#13;
will continue under PERT to fully implement the proposed project and carry out the rural road&#13;
program until municipalities develop the institutional and financial capacity to manage their rural&#13;
road networks. Due to the special nature of the statutes of PERT-PCR, its duration is initially&#13;
limited to the execution of the proposed project, but at mid-term program review, the&#13;
Government jointly with IDB and the Bank will decide whether there is a need to continue with&#13;
PERT-PCR after project completion.&#13;
2.    The overall institutional set up for project execution is described in paras. 3.1 to 3.3 of this&#13;
SAR (see the chart therein). The organizational structure of PERT-PCR is shown in Chart 1&#13;
below. With staff and budget separated from the rest of the Ministry, as well as from PRT, the&#13;
unit enjoys ample technical, administrative and financial autonomy. Its limited personnel is&#13;
recruited at private sector salaries and paid from local counterpart funds. Most of the tasks will&#13;
be undertaken by external consultants engaged under the project. Jobs descriptions and terms of&#13;
reference for each assignment are included in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
Operational Plan for establishing PERT-PCR's Deconcentrated Units&#13;
3.    Implementing the project within the proposed time-frame will demand strong skills to&#13;
manage hundreds of road links spread over difficult remote rural areas. This will require setting&#13;
some "deconcentrated" field offices (Unidades Ejecutoras Desconcentradas, UEDs),&#13;
conveniently located in those departments with active programs, to contract and manage pre-&#13;
investment studies, works and institutional building program. The functions assigned to the&#13;
UJEDs are summarized in Box 1.&#13;
4.    Each UED will be established according to one of the following three possible options:&#13;
(1) contracting out management services to a private firm, (2) establishing an ad-hoc unit with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
staff appointed by PERT-PCR, and (3) delegating the management functions to an existing&#13;
decentralized or local government agency restructured to meet the project requirements. Chart 2&#13;
shows the proposed Operational Plan for setting the deconcentrated units. It is envisaged that&#13;
nine units will be needed to efficiently manage the work programs in the 12 departments selected&#13;
under the project. The location and phasing in the creation of these units have been determined&#13;
taking into account (1) the volume of work in each department or geographic area, (2) potential&#13;
gains to be realized through the proposed location, in terms of improved accessibility to work&#13;
sites (some rural areas are better reached from contiguous departments rather than from their own&#13;
department) and to the existing market of local contractors and consultants, and (3) institutional&#13;
and operational capacity available locally. The size of the UEDs will vary in line with the volume&#13;
and nature of the work planned, but in general will consist of 6 to 8 staff organized in three areas:&#13;
(1) project development (planning, promotion of subprojects and institutional building), (2)&#13;
engineering (review of studies, procurement and contract supervision), and (3) accounting and&#13;
administration. The managers of the UEDs will report directly to the Executive Director of&#13;
PERT-PCR.&#13;

project targets planned for that year are achieved. The proposed targets for the coming year will&#13;
be agreed on with IDB and the Bank by October 30, each year. The project database (see&#13;
Attachments 1 and 2) provides the basis for calculating most of these indicators. In addition, the&#13;
performance indicators for project development impact will be monitored at the project third&#13;
annual review (program mid-term review) and at the end of the program through surveys&#13;
conducted in the context of the performance audits. These audits will verify every six months the&#13;
accuracy of the data in the project information system. An outline of the terms of reference for&#13;
the biannual performance audits is given in Attachment 3.&#13;
Participation Agreements with Municipalities&#13;
6.     MTC through PERT-PCR will enter into inter-administrative "participation agreements"&#13;
with provincial municipalities with jurisdiction over the project areas. The agreements will most&#13;
notably spell out future obligations and undertakings assumed by both parties with regard to the&#13;
execution of the project. Box 2 shows the key features of the participatory agreements. The&#13;
project will avoid further investments in those provinces where compliance with the agreements&#13;
and action programs has not been satisfactory.&#13;
7.     Municipalities, since at this stage lack the necessary institutional capacity, will leave to&#13;
PERT-PCR complete administration of contracts and convenios involved in project execution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Box 2: Key features of Participation Agreements&#13;
The Project Operational Manual includes a standard "Participatory Agreement" to be used during project&#13;
implementation. Key features of the standard agreement are:&#13;
*  LegalAspects. The agreement is between MTC (represented through PERT-PCR) and the provincial&#13;
municipality, but all district municipalities within the province must also sign in. Responsibility for&#13;
administering contracts and managing project activities is vested in PERT-PCR. The authority of&#13;
Municipalities to manage rural roads and to promote construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of rural&#13;
roads is reaffirmed.&#13;
.  Coordination. Coordination between municipalities and PERT-PCR is mandatory for selecting roads,&#13;
identifying and evaluating subprojects and carrying out studies and works related to these sub-projects.&#13;
Municipalities may also participate in the execution of project works provided they comply with the&#13;
requirements and procedures set forth in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
*  Commitments undertaken by Municipalities. Municipalities are required to (1) enter into the institutional&#13;
strengthening program and carry out the action plans drawn up together with PERT-PCR, (2) support&#13;
development of microenterprises and community-based maintenance committees for road maintenance, and&#13;
(3) allocate funds to maintain roads rehabilitated under the project upon finalization of the agreement.&#13;
*  Commitments undertaken by A4TC. MTC is required to (1) keep municipalities filly informed of all project&#13;
activities, (2) provide technical assistance for institutional strengthening in rural road management, (3)&#13;
evaluate together with municipalities the results of project activities, and (4) establish a financial mechanism&#13;
to allow municipalities continue funding maintenance of the roads rehabilitated under the project upon&#13;
finalization of the participation.&#13;
This will enable PERT-PCR demonstrate to the Municipalities the advantages of contracting out&#13;
works and services to the private sector, removing the tendering and supervision processes from&#13;
existing bureaucratic constraints, and developing microenterprises and other beneficiary-based&#13;
organizations to maintain the rural road networks. The participation agreements would reaffirm&#13;
local government responsibilities over rural roads and require their long-term commitment to&#13;
maintaining those roads rehabilitated under the project once the agreement has ended. This, in&#13;
turn, is expected to strengthen "ownership" on the part of municipalities.&#13;
8.     Though the agreements are generally structured on the basis of provinces, all districts&#13;
within a provincial municipality are required to sign in. This will enhance coordination among&#13;
districts and between districts and their provincial municipalities. Furthermore, with assistance&#13;
from the UEDs, provincial municipalities are expected to prepare in consultation with their&#13;
districts, transport plans documenting the actions agreed to improve transport conditions in their&#13;
jurisdictions, as required under the Municipal Organic Law. While the law establishes a&#13;
distinction between provincial and district municipalities, functional assignments between them are&#13;
rather ambiguous inasmuch as both types of municipalities are given largely the same set of&#13;
responsibilities, including those for the provision of local public services. Thus, the transport&#13;
plans will help clarify the distribution of responsibilities for rural roads management between the&#13;
two levels, enhance the impact of the plans by coordinating transport needs at a provincial level,&#13;
and increase efficiency in the delivery of maintenance services by taking advantage of possible&#13;
economies of scale derived from a coordinated approach.&#13;
Coordination with other Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation Programs&#13;
9.     There are several programs sponsored by other Ministries -- some of them with external&#13;
funding -- which support rural development and poverty alleviation initiatives in the same areas&#13;

where the project activities will be undertaken. The overall development impact can be&#13;
significantly enhanced if the programs are coordinated as to complement their activities whenever&#13;
possible and avoid duplication of efforts. By targeting common areas and sequencing the&#13;
respective programs, the project actions on rural roads could be complemented with the&#13;
productive projects sponsored by other programs, with greater development impact on the&#13;
benefited communities. Furthermore, some of these programs include small investments in roads.&#13;
These decentralized organizations outside MTC typically deliver their "road projects" upon&#13;
completion, either to MTC or local governments, as appropriate. Therefore, measures must be&#13;
taken during the development stage of these road projects to ensure that they are technically&#13;
sound and that provisions are made for their future maintenance.&#13;
10.    Table 2 provides a list of rural development programs "active" in the departments selected&#13;
for project implementation, their sponsors, and the kind of coordination that is needed. At the&#13;
central level, MTC will coordinate with MEF and the Ministries of Presidency (FONCODES,&#13;
INADE) and Agriculture all aspects regarding the Government's poverty alleviation strategy and&#13;
the allocation of funds to the various programs that support them. MTC signed a "Cooperation&#13;
Agreement" with FONCODES and is discussing a similar agreement with INADE (which&#13;
together control the largest rural infrastructure programs outside MTC). Key features of these&#13;
agreements are summarized in Box 3. In addition, to further strengthen its functional authority&#13;
MTC will train staff within its Planning Office to set rural roads policy, coordinate investments&#13;
with other agencies that are implementing developing programs, and monitor investments and&#13;
transport performance on a continuous basis.&#13;

11.    To improve coordination at the implementation stage, the UEDs would promote the&#13;
establishment of interinstitutional committees that would be responsible for further promoting the&#13;
project, sharing information about development initiatives in the vicinities of the proposed road&#13;
sub-projects, and reviewing implementation schedules to enhance complementarity or integration&#13;
with other poverty alleviation programs in common areas or departments. The interinstitutional&#13;
committee would include at least the chiefs of the regional PERT-PCR, FONCODES, INADE&#13;
and Agriculture Ministry's offices, the head of the department's road directorate, the mayor of the&#13;
capital, a representative of the Chamber of Commerce of the department and three representatives&#13;
from the communities (including women groups) in the vicinities of the projects being considered&#13;
for analysis. These committees should meet as a minimum once a month and although they will&#13;
not have any specific approval responsibility (which is fully vested upon the chief of the respective&#13;

Box 4: Purpose of the SISP database and Operational Requirements&#13;
Ppsos. The SISPwill serve different purposes, namely:&#13;
a  as a decision- and monitoring-support system for. UEDs, in order to (1) know the main characteristics of the.&#13;
sub-projects presented by the communities to: the UEDs, (2) register the procedures for their approval, (3)&#13;
consolidate the information for all sub-projects under the UED' s jurisdiction; and (4) monitoring the&#13;
implementation of the said sub-projects;&#13;
* as a decision- and monitoring-support system for the PERT-PCR central office to control the performance of&#13;
each individual UED and, through the consolidation of the information of the UEDs, continuously monitor&#13;
the; progress in the implementation of the project;&#13;
- as a support tool for the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank in carrying out their&#13;
supervisory tasks; and&#13;
*  as a support tool for the subsequent post-evaluation of the project and the measurement of the degree of&#13;
achievement of its objectives, as established by the indicators developed through the logical framework.&#13;
Operational Requirements. The SISP should allow its use at the UED level and the consolidation of information&#13;
at PERT-PCR central-office level. It would have to include a system of authorizations to ensure that the&#13;
information is managed and used by the pertinent staff, limiting and recording the access and update by the&#13;
authorized people. It would also have to include back-up systems to ensure that the accumulated information can&#13;
be fully recover in the case of a hardware failure.&#13;
UED), they would have the unique opportunity of informing the UEDs of the advantages and&#13;
disadvantages of undertaking particular subprojects and of carrying particular actions (such as&#13;
methods of construction, procurement, microenterprise development, project development&#13;
impact). This cooperation would also allow the UEDs to involve key base organizations presently&#13;
working in other programs in the identification of road subprojects and delivery of relevant&#13;
institutional components. Though very limited in terms of geographical coverage, the District&#13;
Development Committees established through the PREDES program (supported by FONCODES&#13;
in the department of Cusco) constitute a remarkable example of an institutional mechanism for&#13;
determining priorities and identifying subprojects in a coordinated manner at the local level.&#13;
Project Monitoring Information System and Database&#13;
12.    Supervision of project implementation will rely on an information and monitoring system&#13;
(SISP) that would allow to ascertain on a daily basis the progress in the implementation of each&#13;
sub-project (from its preparation phase to its execution, including maintenance activities after&#13;
completion of the corresponding rehabilitation works) and, consequently, the degree of&#13;
achievement of the project objectives (as measured by the outcome of the Logical Framework).&#13;
Furthermore, the SISP will help control de deconcentrated units and assess the efficiency,&#13;
effectiveness and quality of their performance. The SISP will also constitute a source of&#13;
information for the semi-annual performance audits and for the Banks' supervision missions; it&#13;
should also help prepare the reports that will have to be submitted quarterly to the Banks. Box 4&#13;
summarizes the intended uses of the SISP and key operational requirements to achieve them.&#13;
13.    The SISP will be the key mechanism to monitor the progress in the implementation of a&#13;
large number of sub-projects scattered over the various Peruvian departments. The installation of&#13;
the SISP entails: (i) the definition of the structure of a database; (ii) the definition of the&#13;
procedures to capture, update and analyze the collected data (mainly technical, financial and social&#13;
data) for each sub-project under preparation or implementation, or already completed; and (iii) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115-&#13;
purchase and installation of the pertinent computing hardware and software as well as the data&#13;
transmission equipment.&#13;
14.   The SISP's database values would be inputted incrementally at every step of the project&#13;
implementation. Upon a community's request for, or preliminary identification of a candidate&#13;
sub-project, the corresponding record will be opened in the database. Consequently, upon&#13;
completion of the field surveys, the socio-economic and technical data will be incorporated into&#13;
the record; subsequently, through the pertinent programs and models, the summary social,&#13;
economic and engineering indicators will be obtained. Attachment I includes the list of variables&#13;
that would be filled for each record of the database (and that constitute the bases of the data to be&#13;
collected by consultants on their field visits). Attachment 2 includes the performance indicators&#13;
that would be obtained from the database. The description of the socio-economic evaluation&#13;
model and the associated template are given in Annex 11.&#13;
15.   The PERT-PCR has engaged the services of a specialized information systems firm to&#13;
develop the hardware and software of the SISP, including the input, update and backup processes&#13;
and the communication links to the UEDs. The SISP shall be fully developed and tested as part&#13;
of the Project Operational Manual (whose adoption is a condition for loan effectiveness). The&#13;
initial structure and system processes of the SISP will be reviewed every six months and adapted&#13;
as necessary to attend the demands of the project management and the quarterly performance&#13;
audits.&#13;
16.   In principle, the structure of the database would resemble a distributed system whereby&#13;
the maintenance of the database would be the responsibility of each UEDs, but access to it and the&#13;
use of its analysis tools can be undertaken from any of the user-end computers. The information&#13;
generated by each UED would be downloaded at least every other day to the PERT-PCR's&#13;
central offices. The system would have the mechanisms to check the consistency and integrity of&#13;
the information, flagging out any deviations from expected values (such as agricultural yields or&#13;
costs of particular rehabilitation activities). These mechanisms would partly be facilitated by&#13;
linking the SISP to the statistical information of the National Statistical Institute (INEI). The&#13;
INEI has information on socio-economic values ("Censo Nacional de Poblaci6n y Vivienda de&#13;
1994"), existing infrastructure and institutions involved ("Encuesta de Infraestructura Distrital de&#13;
1994"), economic activities ("Censo de Actividad Econ6mica Provincial de 1993"), and district&#13;
agricultural and livestock productions ("Tercera Encuesta Agro-Pecuaria Nacional de 1995).&#13;
The INEI has also developed an ARC-INFO geographic information system of the entire country.&#13;
This system however lacks information on roads. An opportunity exists to establish an exchange&#13;
of information between the PERT-PCR and the INEI, whereby the former provides INEI with&#13;
information on rural and departmental roads as they are rehabilitated and the latter provides&#13;
PERT-PCR with the socio-economic information listed above.&#13;
17.   To ensure the adequate functioning of the SISP, the PERT-PCR would hire a full-time&#13;
information systems specialist that would be entrusted with the management of the SISP. Each&#13;
UED will have staff fully trained in the operation of the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116-&#13;
Internal Control and Flow of Project Funds&#13;
18.   The Internal Control and Financial Unit established within PERT-PCR will (1) issue&#13;
implementation guidelines and perform financial accounting procedures to account for all&#13;
transactions between the PERT-PCR and the UEDs; and (2) monitor all flow of funds, including&#13;
but not limited to, transfers, payments and disbursements between the special accounts (IDB,&#13;
IBRD, and the Government), the Bridge Account (where all of the funds transferred from special&#13;
accounts will be deposited to make payments and transfers to UEDs) and the accounts at the&#13;
UEDs. This Internal Control and Financial Unit within the PERT-PCR will also prepare financial&#13;
accounting reports on a monthly, quarterly and yearly basis, as specified in the Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
19.   Based on a review of the financial information and accounting system currently in&#13;
operation at PERT, and after discussions with financial and administrative personnel, it has been&#13;
determined that the flow of funds and investments involved in this Rural Roads Rehabilitation and&#13;
Maintenance Project (under the PERT-PCR unit) should be accounted for by using the following&#13;
financial system and configuration mode.&#13;
(a) Three separate special accounts will be opened to account for each of the funds&#13;
commitments from each of the respective organizations involved in the Project, namely the&#13;
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank (IBRD), and the Government&#13;
of Perui (GP). For instance, the IBRD's account will be opened with a private banking&#13;
institution in Lima. The GP's special account specifying that such a condition is necessary&#13;
to properly implement without delays and bureaucratic complications the investment&#13;
commitments under this Project. The Ministry of Economic and Finance (MEF) has&#13;
indicated his support for such a separate account if such clause is included in the&#13;
international loan agreement. Precedent exists for such a procedure based on an existing&#13;
arrangement with an on-going loan disbursement operation by the World Bank where a&#13;
separate account has been maintained. These separate and special accounts will be&#13;
controlled by the PERT-PCR unit and will be in the same banking institution for ease in&#13;
the transfer and administration of project funds to another Bridge and Rotary Account as&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
(b) The Transit Account (TA), controlled by the PERT-PCR unit and residing at the same&#13;
banking institution, will be used to extract the required funds for the execution of the&#13;
Project's Disbursements and Transfers based on the prescribed "contra-partidd' for this&#13;
Project. This account will be maintained in local currency. This means that conversion of&#13;
the designated currency from each of the Bank's special accounts, namely the IDB and the&#13;
IBRD, will be made at the date of transfer to the TA for subsequent use in the Project.&#13;
This TA will need to have some excess funds, and as such will operate as a revolving bank&#13;
account. This feature is required in order to account for the transfer of funds to the UEDs&#13;
for advances and disbursements.&#13;
(c) The TA will be used by the PERT-PCR unit to feed each of the UEDs' depository&#13;
accounts in the bank's branch system serving the respective UEDs. Since it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117-&#13;
recommended the use of a private banking institution with bank offices in each department&#13;
or municipalities, such a banking arrangement will improve the transfer and availability of&#13;
funds to each of the UEDs. The UEDs' depository accounts will be maintained at a zero&#13;
balance at all times. This means that UEDs must make the request for funds known to the&#13;
PERT-PCR for review and approval before disbursement or transfer of funds can be&#13;
initiated. There will be an automatic transfer from the TA to the depository account at the&#13;
UED in the same date due to the fact that the same bank branch system serves all of the&#13;
UEDs and municipalities involved in the Project.&#13;
(d)  All payments for contracts, consulting services and agreements will be made by the UEDs&#13;
and/or municipalities. All of the pertinent information, including contracts, agreements,&#13;
invoices, bills of sale, etc., will be send to the PERT-PCR unit for processing and final&#13;
approval and payments. Essentially, all of the financial accounting for transactions&#13;
incurred during the Project's execution and disbursements of funds will be controlled at&#13;
the PERT-PCR unit in Lima. Similarly, all of cash and flow of funds, including&#13;
reconciliation of bank accounts in the entire system, will be centrally controlled and&#13;
performed at the PERT-PCR unit in Lima.&#13;
20.   The internal control and financial unit within the PERT-PCR, described above, will be&#13;
subject to an external and independent audit by CPAs. At loan negotiations, agreement will be&#13;
reached that Government will appoint a firm of independent public accountants (external auditors)&#13;
acceptable to the IDB and the World Bank on this joint-financing Program. Such a firm will audit&#13;
project expenditures, the special accounts, the TA at the PERT-PCR unit, the UEDs and project&#13;
accounts, as well as the entire information and accounting system used by the PERT-PCR unit in&#13;
the execution of this Program. The first audit will start in 1995 with terms of reference acceptable&#13;
to both Banks. Certified copies of the annual audit reports will be furnished to both Banks within&#13;
six months after the close of the Government's fiscal year. The audit report will include a&#13;
separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against certified SOEs.&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
The Project Operational Manual&#13;
1.   In order to ensure consistency in the implementation of the project's various components&#13;
across departments, PERT-PCR will use a Project Operational Manual (Manual de Operaciones&#13;
del Proyecto-MOP) that will clearly define the guidelines and procedures to be followed by all&#13;
implementing units when discharging their responsibilities in the execution of the project. The&#13;
MOP is a self-content organized compilation of all documents needed to support project&#13;
implementation, from a summary of the project objectives, scope and guiding principles which will&#13;
be used when communicating the project to local governments and other potential beneficiaries,&#13;
to the project eligibility criteria and participatory mechanisms that will be applied in the selection&#13;
of project investments and assessment of transport needs at the local level, to a set of technical&#13;
guidelines and standards for design and management of rural roads, to the procurement and&#13;
contract administration procedures that will be followed to ensure compliance with the guidelines&#13;
agreed with IDB and the Bank.&#13;
2.    The format and content of the manual was reviewed during the appraisal mission; the&#13;
project preparation unit, assisted by consultants, is finalizing its preparation incorporating&#13;
comments made by the appraisal mission. The attached table shows an indicative table of&#13;
contents. However, the most relevant parts of the manual are discussed in detail in other annexes&#13;
of the Staff Appraisal Report. In particular, Annex 8 summarizes the organizational arrangements&#13;
an institutional set up for project execution, Annex 10 the methodology agreed for participatory&#13;
assessments, and Annex 11 the eligibility criteria for selection of subprojects.&#13;
3.    While some of the documents in the manual will remain unchanged throughout project&#13;
implementation, others --especially on the technical side-- are expected to evolve based on&#13;
feedback from implementation and know how obtained through the technical assistance program.&#13;
As an example, the procedures to create and contract out microenterprises for road maintenance,&#13;
schedule, supervise and compensate for the works will be developed by consultants engaged&#13;
under the technical assistance program, and upon approval incorporated into the manual. Hence,&#13;
the MOP will be modified from time to time in consultation with IDB and the Bank, to take&#13;
account of the experience gained during project implementation. The Executive Committee of&#13;
PERT-PCR will approve and put into effect the MOP prior to loan effectiveness. At negotiations,&#13;
assurances will be given that all the project components would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
the procedures set forth in the Project Operational Manual. Adherence to the manual will be&#13;
assessed every six months by external auditors engaged for the performance audit of PCR and its&#13;
UEDs.&#13;

ANNEX 10&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Participatory Planning Component&#13;
Background&#13;
1.   It is intended that sub-projects in the Rural Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance project&#13;
be generated or prioritized by the communities themselves upon request to their Municipalities or&#13;
the UEDs of PERT-PCR. In order to develop a mechanism for effective community participation,&#13;
the project appraisal mission of May 1995 included two consultants skilled in the application of&#13;
participatory techniques and beneficiary assessment. The PERT-PCR in Peru provided excellent&#13;
support, especially through Messrs. R. Acco (sociologist) and Rodriguez (Rural Road Engineer),&#13;
both seasoned staff in the field of community participation in Perui who actively participated in the&#13;
various workshops and in defining the operational methodology that will be used throughout&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
2.    The project team considered that if early involvement of beneficiaries was achieved, it&#13;
could play a key role in ensuring sustainability of the road maintenance strategy pursued under the&#13;
project. The objectives of the May 1995 appraisal mission in this regard were basically to: (a)&#13;
apply the LogFrame methodology to communicate the project to beneficiaries in the field, test the&#13;
validity of the project approach and better assess transport needs at the local level; (b) assess the&#13;
capacity of Peruvian NGO's for involvement in the project and the applicability of existing&#13;
community participation practices employed by local agencies; (c) develop a methodology tailored&#13;
to the culture of the sierra population to routinely carry out community participatory workshops;&#13;
(d) train local staff in the application of the agreed methodology; and (e) prepare terms of&#13;
reference for developing micro-enterprises and maintenance committees, composed of&#13;
beneficiaries, for the road maintenance component of the project.&#13;
3.    The participatory exercises carried out confirmed the potential benefits and viability of the&#13;
participatory approach proposed under the project. As noted, some adjustments to the initial&#13;
methodology were introduced on the basis of the experience gained in the field. The project team&#13;
was highly impressed with the interest shown by the sample of communities involved, the candid&#13;
and clear way they used to describe their transport needs, and the priority they give to the&#13;
proposed project as well as to their future involvement in road maintenance.&#13;
4.    This annex includes, as Attachment 1, the Operational Guidelines for the application of the&#13;
participatory process, which will be part of the Project Operational Manual. The guidelines were&#13;
developed in the field and are the main output of the participatory process. They are intended to&#13;
be used by local consultants in applying participatory mechanisms during project development and&#13;
implementation. The Operational Guidelines were discussed and agreed to with the&#13;
representatives of the PPU. They are written in Spanish.&#13;

5.    Participatory meetings. The following participatory meetings were held i) in Cusco,&#13;
Department of Cusco on May 29, 1995 attended by 24 participants including six local alcaldes&#13;
and members of the local construction industry; ii) in Ccorca, Department of Cusco on May 30,&#13;
1995 where participants at the meeting numbered about 200, but it was not possible to get a list&#13;
of names; iii) in Huancavelica, Department of Huancavelica on June 2, 1995 attended by about 37&#13;
participants including members of local agencies of FONCODES and COOPOP, members of the&#13;
Sub-regional Directorate of Planning, members of local transport companies, Mothers Clubs, the&#13;
local university, the College of Engineers and NGO's and in iv) Izcuchaca, Department of&#13;
Huancavelica on June 3, 1995 attended by about 50 participants including local mayors, and&#13;
members of Mother's Clubs. A full list of participants is in the Project Files.&#13;
Report back on the findings of the Participatory Approach in the Road Maintenance&#13;
Component of the RRRMP project&#13;
6.    The Peruvian government is implementing general policies aimed at integrating the rural&#13;
poor into the mainstream of national economy and culture. The functional impassability of the&#13;
rural roads network is one of the conditions that must be changed so that the outlying areas can&#13;
become a functional part of the nation. The present joint project by the World Bank, IDB and the&#13;
Government of Peru aims to improve rural roads by rehabilitation and promotion of a permanent&#13;
maintenance program.&#13;
7.    Road maintenance is the missing link in the chain of events needed to assure efficient&#13;
transportation systems. Regardless of how well constructed or rehabilitated roads are, in the long&#13;
run without maintenance the trafficability of roads is compromised, and with it, a wide array of&#13;
services that directly impact in the livelihood of towns and villages. A mere intellectual&#13;
understanding of the dire effects of road maintenance deficit is not enough to accomplish behavior&#13;
modification leading to effective maintenance efforts. If changes of community attitudes towards&#13;
maintenance are necessary, then the people whose behavior has to change must see their own&#13;
interests linked with the change and commit themselves to it.&#13;
8.    How can the people within the local system learn the value and content of new social&#13;
behaviors that will help bring in much needed development? It is not only by merely giving&#13;
beneficiaries a description of the objectives involved in planning and implementing development&#13;
activities. It may be then too late to generate behavior modification because community members&#13;
already know that they are perceived as passive recipients of development initiatives. There is&#13;
another approach that will allow beneficiaries more input and control. In this approach,&#13;
stakeholders have to go through a process of evaluating their needs, defining development&#13;
objectives and learning what they themselves would have to do to implement and sustain their&#13;
project. Because it is the learning produced by working together that creates ownership and&#13;
lasting relationships, there is simply no other way to build ownership and a productive network of&#13;
relationships other than by involving the relevant stakeholders in participatory sessions. An&#13;
adapted version of this process, the Community Participatory Workshop is applied here.&#13;
9.    Participation is a process through which stakeholders influence and share control over&#13;
development initiatives. How can it be implemented in a rural road rehabilitation and maintenance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
project? In the case of the Peruvian Rural Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project, the&#13;
answer is promoting stakeholders' ownership of the project, by means of linking the project with&#13;
their own needs concerning transportation services. By including participatory project planning&#13;
methodology, it was expected that the process:&#13;
* would lead to a greater dialogue between the government representatives, Proyecto Especial&#13;
de Caminos Rurales PERT-PCR and the local community organizations;&#13;
*  would lead to greater ownership of the strategy by the Peruvians at every level;&#13;
*  would contribute to the empowerment of people in rural and poor urban communities by&#13;
giving them an opportunity to assess their own needs and propose solutions;&#13;
*  would likely lead to better implementation and sustainability of follow-on projects.&#13;
10.   To achieve the intended objective of poverty alleviation in Peru6 the very project had to be&#13;
designed around the purposeful inclusion of a large share of local labor, both in unskilled tasks&#13;
and as members of micro-enterprises at charge of road maintenance. In this phase, a specific&#13;
design for participatory interventions at the level of rural indigenous communities was included as&#13;
the necessary means to:&#13;
*  ensure that all the needs of the rural poor were taken into account;&#13;
*  provide local communities with some necessary information about the project and their role in&#13;
the project;&#13;
*  include local solutions in the project design;&#13;
*  mobilize support for road maintenance through increasing ownership of the project and also&#13;
through promotion of micro-enterprise formation and operation.&#13;
In this way the project will address the needs of the poorest rural areas, integrating them into&#13;
mainstream economic activities by means of a working road network and so contributing to&#13;
poverty alleviation through employment generation.&#13;
Reaching the very poor stakeholders&#13;
11.   Participatory methods that have been satisfactorily used to involve government officials&#13;
and other relatively powerful stakeholders in development initiatives may be often inappropriate&#13;
or inadequate for reaching the poor. There are many cultural, economic and political barriers&#13;
which effectively prevent poor people from having any real stake in development initiatives.&#13;
Without special efforts by the project designers, and without appropriate policies to address and&#13;
overcome these obstacles, the voice of the poor will not be heard and their participation will at&#13;
best be a token one. Reaching the poor, therefore, requires working with them to learn about&#13;
their needs, understanding how development decisions are made in their communities, and&#13;
identifying institutions and mechanisms which can get opportunities and resources into their&#13;
hands. The decision to hold community participation workshops with comuneros in the high&#13;
sierra was perceived by the project team as the most adequate means to reach the Peruvian poor.&#13;
12.   Involving the poor in decision-making and getting resources to them also requires&#13;
strengthening their capacity to act for themselves. This occurs through investments in social&#13;
capital such as promoting local-level institutions and participatory processes; and support for&#13;
community-based development efforts planned and implemented from the bottom up. These&#13;
efforts require responsive institutions and legal and regulatory policies which enable, rather than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134-&#13;
hinder, local participation. In Periu, institutional support for community involvement was&#13;
straightforward and constant throughout the RRRMP activities in the rural sierra. As designed,&#13;
several meetings of MTC personnel and community leaders reinforced local institutions and&#13;
provided the basis for an efficient network that would in the future help project implementation.&#13;
This reflects an important objective of the project team: that the final project design, then, had to&#13;
be co-produced by many of the people-at different organizational levels-who will have to work&#13;
together to implement it. Promoting a shared ownership of the project that leads to community&#13;
empowerment is also an intended product of participatory interventions.&#13;
Participatory Project Planning&#13;
13.   The Bank mission in Peru began local implementation of the participatory phase of the&#13;
project planning on May 23, 1995. Information-gathering meetings with the local representatives&#13;
of the Ministerio de Transportes y Comunicacion (MTC) included agreements about two&#13;
different levels of community meetings. Selection of villages for methodology testing and&#13;
evaluation was contingent upon poverty evaluation, by which only extremely poor communities in&#13;
isolated regions were included.&#13;
14.   A preliminary design for Community Participatory Workshop included two levels of public&#13;
involvement. The first with community leaders (alcaldes, gobernadores and such) and heads of&#13;
base organizations that are representatives of the intended beneficiaries, or heads of NGOs&#13;
working with the poor in a similar way to the government body, FONCODES. These meetings in&#13;
the cities of Cusco and Huancavelica lasted 5 to 6 hours.&#13;
15.   The second level of Community Participatory Workshop was designed around a broad&#13;
open invitation to whole communities, to gather in one-day meetings. This participatory design&#13;
was applied to two rural communities, one was Ccorcca, in the Cusco Department and the second&#13;
was Izcuchaca, in the Huancavelica Department. In both cases, nearby communities in the&#13;
walking range vicinity were also included. Attendance fluctuated between 205 in Ccorcca and 50&#13;
participants in Izcuchaca, mainly due to seasonal constraints (potato harvesting season). Lunch&#13;
was provided because the workshop was scheduled to begin at 10:00 a.m. and continued into the&#13;
evening. Many participants live in nearby communities, so attendance was conditioned to the&#13;
possibility of going back to their places during daylight hours, which necessitated ending the&#13;
workshops around 4:00 p.m., to allow the attendees to return to their homes before dark. This&#13;
also was done for security reasons, as there is renewed guerrilla activity in the sierra around&#13;
Huancavelica.&#13;
Community Participatory Workshop Design&#13;
16.   The objectives of the World Bank mission included developing a proven methodology that&#13;
could be replicated by local facilitator teams from MTC for enhancing community participation in&#13;
project implementation. A widely known version of Logical Framework, (LF) as developed in the&#13;
field by Inter-American Development Bank teams, was initially selected and applied by the&#13;
original project team to organize project data. In this case, backup training and all necessary&#13;
information were easily available. This was not the case in Cusco and Huancavelica.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
17.   When LF was applied at the leaders' participatory workshops in the cities of Cusco and&#13;
Huancavelica, it was intended to teach them the method to allow development of their own LF&#13;
design. Organizational difficulties resulted in lack of time which prevented a detailed exposition&#13;
of the methodology. Other obstacles were participant's lack of familiarity with logical&#13;
connections (between means and ends, and cause and effect) and a deficit of detailed information&#13;
about road maintenance that could be applied to long term planning. Participants were able to&#13;
design problem trees and objectives trees, connecting creation of micro-enterprises with road&#13;
maintenance, and discuss some of the risks/assumptions. Along the whole process, the wider&#13;
purpose of having community leaders going through a problem-solving learning experience&#13;
together was accomplished, and connections between leaders' different professions and origins&#13;
were established. They developed a serious interest in micro-enterprise formation.&#13;
18.   After taking stock from the Cusco experience, and focusing into the intrinsic value for a&#13;
group to go together through a process of identifying problems, transforming them into objectives&#13;
and evaluating alternatives for solutions, a design very similar to the LF was chosen. This is a&#13;
simplified version of William Smith's Appreciation-Influence-Control (A-I-C) methodology, as&#13;
described in World Bank Sourcebook on Participation, (p. 141), and follows the same logic&#13;
structure of the Logical Framework. Both methods differ in the techniques used, not in the&#13;
sequence of thinking (problems, objectives and strategies). In the A-I-C method, groups are&#13;
requested to produce a common drawing of the problematic situation first, of the common&#13;
development objectives second, and finally to suggest strategies to pursue objectives by means of&#13;
cards that are organized in logical sequences by the facilitators of the participatory process.&#13;
19.   Collective drawing on large paper sheets enabled these groups to work together. It&#13;
allowed expression of ideas to even illiterate participants; facilitated dialogue between them and&#13;
gave a concrete instrument to weave their ideas together and to share them with the rest of the&#13;
workshop participants. Both male and female participants were encouraged to take the role of&#13;
group leader and explain publicly each groups' drawings, so further encouraging participation&#13;
across gender barriers. At the end of the workshops, facilitators would explain the main findings,&#13;
assess consensual areas and connect workshop findings with Bank's project guidelines, giving&#13;
participants a clear idea of the mutual involvement needed for project success.&#13;
Selection of Stakeholders&#13;
20.   Selection of stakeholders is the first step in the process of organizing a community&#13;
participatory workshop. If one of the purposes is to promote ownership of the project in the local&#13;
community, this selection is very important. Stakeholders are those affected by the outcome--&#13;
negatively or positively, or those who can affect the outcome of a proposed intervention.&#13;
Because rural roads are such an important aspect in the area's development, the selection of&#13;
stakeholders had to range from representatives of national government; of MTC, state or&#13;
provincial authorities to local and municipal level representatives. A governmental institution,&#13;
FONCODES, and its branch PREDES in Cusco was instrumental in identifying NGOs and local&#13;
leaders. Mayors (alcaldes) were the first resource used in selecting leaders from the rural&#13;
communities. They would give detailed information about the basic structure of the community&#13;
and its organizations. Spontaneous mobilization happened: when local leaders knew about the&#13;

meetings, they invited themselves. One group attended the Cusco meeting after hearing about it&#13;
by the local radio news.&#13;
21.    Also instrumental in this process was the ancestral ayllu, or communal organization that&#13;
persists from the time of the Inca empire. This ayllu tradition has always invested local leaders&#13;
with the task of representing their communities; for the Community Participatory Workshop it&#13;
was indispensable in getting local leaders to the table. Among those leaders, representatives of&#13;
women's groups like the Mother's Clubs were very important to provide a description of social&#13;
needs (education; health-care) related to road rehabilitation and maintenance. Also, in the case of&#13;
the Huancavelica meeting, they provided community women's view concerning their readiness for&#13;
future road maintenance works.&#13;

CSommunity Participatory Workshop Development&#13;
22.    Locations for the workshops were chosen to allow as many people as possible to attend.&#13;
In the rural village of Ccorcca, the meeting was held in the public Plaza de Armas, as this was the&#13;
only paved space available to allow around 200 people to gather. Having the meeting in the open&#13;
air with no protection against the sun for about six hours was not the ideal situation. Impromptu&#13;
collaboration from the school provided tables, but not enough chairs. The walls of the major's&#13;
office (alcaldia) were chosen to hold the graphs produced. In Izcuchaca, conditions were more&#13;
favorable and it was easier to use the empty school building. After finding the place and&#13;
organizing the provision of teaching materials and food for the participants, the process of the&#13;
workshop developed as follows:&#13;
23.    At the beginning of the workshop, community participants were greeted by MTC&#13;
representatives, IBRD personnel, and facilitators. Participants were invited to form small&#13;
heterogeneous groups. The purpose was to facilitate interaction between persons from different&#13;
fields of activity that usually have no chance to work together. The groups were asked to work&#13;
together in a common drawing representing their actual transportation problems. When the&#13;
drawings were finished, (using approximately 30 minutes) the groups were invited to select a&#13;
participant as leader, who would step in front of the meeting and explain their ideas and answer&#13;
audience's questions. In this phase, it is interesting to note the detailed quality of the drawings,&#13;
thus revealing the villagers' in-depth knowledge of the roads and of their problems. The&#13;
comuneros know the roads i in timate detail, because they spend so much time of their lives&#13;
walking  through them, carryentitheir products and herding their animals to pasture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137-&#13;
24.    After finishing the exposition of each group's results, the participants were invited to&#13;
transform their problems into objectives, by means of drawing a picture of their communities once&#13;
problems were solved. How the future would look like, with the roads rehabilitated and&#13;
maintained? Due to their multiple needs, it was inevitable that groups were simultaneously&#13;
dealing with education, health and electricity needs, in addition to transportation. By first&#13;
confronting their transportation needs, the villagers quickly came to see how important it was to&#13;
have roads rehabilitated in order to solve those other needs. The learning process continued by&#13;
inviting them to present their ideal villages drawings in public and again answering questions.&#13;
25.    Finally, the participants were reorganized into homogeneous groups, each one working&#13;
with people of their own communities, and invited to produce a listing of those strategies that&#13;
would help them achieve their dreams. Focusing on those village developments that would&#13;
connect them with road maintenance. Discussion of micro-enterprise formation was encouraged,&#13;
and more information linking workshop's conclusions with IBRD project design offered, in order&#13;
to weave the workshop conclusions within the project design. As an example of the&#13;
methodology, participants groups' conclusions at the Community Participatory Workshop held in&#13;
the village of Izcuchaca, on June 13, 1995, are listed below.&#13;
First exercise: What are the community transportation problems?&#13;
The road is too steep, too narrow, with too many curves. The road lacks pavement, and it becomes slippery when it&#13;
rains. It is impossible for big trucks to pass, so the community is deprived of selling their products and of&#13;
obtaining some other industrial products. We have very few resources and sometimes go hungry. If people are&#13;
extremely poor, their children die from under nourishment and illness. In winter times there is no traffic between&#13;
Palca and Nunungayoc, due to the potholes and the rain that swells the Palca river and floods the road. In general,&#13;
we are almost isolated and lack health and education services. People are emigrating and those who stay are&#13;
becoming poorer.&#13;
Second exercise: What are the community development objectives?&#13;
Road maintenance, including works of art, assured. Communities would have electricity and other services.&#13;
Product transportation to the markets in due time. Reasonable cost of construction materials, due to reduction in&#13;
the price of its transport. Also, economical price for transportation of people.&#13;
Steady assistance by teachers, able to teach every day.&#13;
Health assistance appropriate in case of emergencies like cholera.&#13;
Commerce with other communities improved; local Sunday markets established in several communities. More&#13;
attention from state authorities.&#13;
Progressive substitution of animal transportation by vehicular transportation.&#13;
Bridges with enough capacity that allow heavy truck loads to go through.&#13;
More mineral exploitation with trucks transporting necessary tools for mineral extraction, e.g.: silver, zinc,&#13;
copper, lead, silicon and kaolin.&#13;
More in site production of materials and products. More potatoes, rice, wheat produced.&#13;
More and better use of hydraulic resources.&#13;
Raising progress expectations to be again frustrated, because of no IBRD or Peruvian Government timely delivery,&#13;
would be a new problem.&#13;
A general improvement in life conditions would make comuneros happier.&#13;
Third exercise: What are the development strategies that the community could implement?&#13;
Following the first two exercises, the groups were given small cards, and invited to write one idea in each card&#13;
about possible strategies to achieve the ideal situation described in exercise two. There were no limits to the&#13;
numbers of cards/ideas developed. Classification of cards produced by groups yielded five large categories:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
1.- Setting Development Committees: proposal to establish a ten-person Road Maintenance Committee, ruled by&#13;
communal law, supporte by own and MTC resources. This committee should have the responsibility to organize&#13;
the work teams to perform road maintenance, and also help establish some micro-enterprises.&#13;
2.- How would the Committees function?: With active community involvement, especially about&#13;
road/transportation emergencies. Members would rotate, so everybody can be included and learn. Special&#13;
attention to the inclusion of women, already organized in Mothers' Clubs.&#13;
3.- Funding for the road maintenance andfor the Committees: direct tolls are not appropriate due to the low&#13;
traffic levels. Instead, active involvement of transport companies, which would pay dues to receive the&#13;
transportation concession, in coordination with MTC or municipalities. Some help was needed with the provision&#13;
of manual tools from MTC for performing road maintenance works.&#13;
4.- Other external support: It is necessary to coordinate with other communities and agree on what are each&#13;
community's responsibilities concerning their share of road maintenance. Proposal to form a multi-sector&#13;
committees (transport experts, comuneros, transportistas, etc.) with other communities to promote support for road&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
5.- Public education campaign: Need to include a permanent public education effort, to make children and adults&#13;
aware of the community dependency on roads for development. This should be supported by Ministry of&#13;
Education programs. Promote the preventive care of the roads, in order to avoid trash, stones, and other&#13;
intentional road damages.&#13;
26.    The following boxes record i) the transportation problems as identified by the Community&#13;
Participatory Workshop in Cusco; ii) a general synopsis of the transportation problems&#13;
encountered in cities like Cusco and Huancavelica and iii) the transportation objectives as&#13;
designed by the participants in the workshops. The Logical Framework as designed by the&#13;
participants of the Community Participatory Workshop in Cusco May 29,1995 is also attached.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
27.    Community participatory workshops are a powerful way of mobilizing public involvement&#13;
and a sense of ownership of a development project. Even under the difficult conditions of&#13;
extreme poverty, Peruvian comuneros know exactly what their problems are, what they dream as&#13;
community development and what has to be done to--more than alleviate poverty--give them the&#13;
basic and necessary conditions under which promote their own economic and social improvement.&#13;
Ready to move beyond the phase of project design, frequently villagers are anxious to see their&#13;
inclusion progressing towards an active participation in road maintenance works. Community&#13;
consultation becomes inexorably community mobilization. The role of the RRRMP project&#13;
concerning poverty alleviation is more than a purpose declaration: it now becomes a shared&#13;
objective that connects international funding institutions, the government of Perui and the high&#13;
sierra comuneros. Extremely poor communities' development dreams mobilized by consultation&#13;
processes need to be channeled into common ventures that will make of long postponed&#13;
improvement expectations a concrete reality.&#13;

Transportation problems as identffied by the Communty Paipatory Workshop inCsco May 2% 199L&#13;
*  There is a need for a nationa, and regional transportation plan, with wide state support. M.aintenance&#13;
planning and its fmuding is a must. Specialized tools and vtained labor also is needed.&#13;
*  Roads not Maintained are dangerous, they have steep climbing and  acurves. They are also narrow, and.&#13;
two vehicles can't pass. In the road between   soA yPpinto-Aea, bridges on't support&#13;
adequate truck tonnagte:&#13;
*  Problems wth high transportation costs are widespread: not only products fo the market have higher&#13;
prices, but importing products into villages is unreason xpensive. This is blocking mmerce between&#13;
districts and villages. A consequence is the isolaion of vles. There is some problmuithcomne&#13;
emigating to Lima or other cities, .in search ofbeer work opportunities.&#13;
*  There is a deficit in health and educational services because of rasportation difficulties. Health providers&#13;
can't visit the villages frequmtly due to bad road conditions. Teachers don-'t provide steady attention to .&#13;
students for the same reason. This reverts in blocking villagers' access- to better living conditions and&#13;
poverty worsens.&#13;
*  Also public transportation.is costly and unsafe. When products, animals and peopleare transported&#13;
together, there is a health problem for people.&#13;
Problems with transportation in cities:like Cuwco and Huancaelica-&#13;
*  There is no funding allocation for road construction and maintenancet There are no lel p s to&#13;
promote private activity, but only a centralized, highly bueaucratic adnilnistration of trnort syste.-&#13;
*  There is no night transrtaton system.&#13;
*  There is an indiscriminate import of non-commercial vehicles, but few ded.icated to transport needs, without:&#13;
governmental policy.&#13;
*  There is a lack of organized provision of services, undue free competence for the sae routes while others are.&#13;
unattended by providers.&#13;

TALLERES DE PARTICIPACION COMUNITARIA&#13;
PROYECTO DE REHABILITACION Y MANTENIMIENTO DE CAMINOS RURALES&#13;
Guias Operativas para la Consulta a los Beneficiarios&#13;
1.    La metodologia del Taller de Participaci6n Comunitaria tiende a asegurar la participaci6n de&#13;
toda la comunidad involucrada en el exito futuro del proyecto, en el grado adecuado a su interes. La&#13;
aplicaci6n cuidadosa de la participaci6n comunitaria apoya el concepto te6rico que conecta la&#13;
sostenibilidad futura del proyecto con el grado de participaci6n comunitaria en las etapas de disefio,&#13;
ejecuci6n y mantenimiento del mismo. En este Manual, se describiran los pasos necesarios para&#13;
asegurar la involucraci6n de todos aquellos sectores cuya participaci6n es absolutamente necesaria para&#13;
la sostenibilidad futura del proyecto; se describira el mecanismo de identificaci6n de sus necesidades en&#13;
el area del transporte y se resumiran aquellas soluciones a los problemas del transporte elaboradas por&#13;
los mismos beneficiarios. El prop6sito del Taller de Participaci6n Comunitaria se describira&#13;
formalmente en todas las localidades de la siguiente manera:&#13;
"Como proveer de nantenimiento confinuado a los caminos rurales a ser rehabilitados&#13;
prMimamnentepor elproyecto conjunto del Banco Mundial, el BID y el Gobierno del Perui."&#13;
QUILENES PARTICIrPAN?&#13;
IDENTIFICACION DE LOS INVOLUCRADOS&#13;
2.    Este modelo tiene dos formas, adecuadas a las diferencias caracteristicas del ambito urbano y&#13;
rural. Lo que se va a presentar aqui es la versi6n adecuada al ambito rural.. Una vez elegida la&#13;
localidad donde se va a realizar la consulta comunitaria, y previamente a la preparaci6n del Taller de&#13;
Participaci6n Comunitaria, se debera comenzar con una cuidadosa identificaci6n de los interesados&#13;
directos e indirectos en el proyecto. Involucrados son todos aquellas personas individuales o grupos&#13;
cuyo quehacer diario puede afectar el desenvolvintiento del sistema previsto. En el caso de los&#13;
caminos rurales, un mapeo de todos los posibles involucrados tendria que incluir a las fuerzas vivas de&#13;
la comunidad: los usuarios del sistema de transporte, los empresarios transportistas, los contratistas que&#13;
hacen planificaci6n, rehabilitaci6n y mantenimiento de caminos, los representantes de la mano de obra,&#13;
las entidades intemmedias u Organizaciones No Gubemamentales, Fondos Ejecutivos tipo&#13;
FONCODES, todas las autoridades locales de la comunidad, (Alcalde, Regidores, Gobemador, etc.),&#13;
mas los representantes locales del Ministerio de Transporte y de otros programas de los Ministerios,&#13;
tales como PRA, PRONAA y COOPOP. Se tiene que asegurar la legitimidad del proceso por medio&#13;
de la inclusi6n de representantes de todos los sectores involucrados, designados por ellos mismos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
Esto tambien asegurara que los participantes tomen el proyecto como algo de su propiedad y al hacerlo&#13;
propio, aseguren su viabilidad y sostenimiento. La etapa de la identificaci6n de los involucrados se&#13;
hara con la ayuda invalorable del personal tecnico del PERT, Ministerio de Transportes,&#13;
Comunicaciones, Vivienda y Construcciones (MTCVC). Este personal tecnico, por estar familiarizado&#13;
con la zona, puede tambien sugerir los nombres de personas o entidades que, aun sin tener titulos&#13;
formales, tengan influencia en la zona y puedan ayudar a desarrollar un proceso mas participativo. La&#13;
invitaci6n de los involucrados a participar puede ser hecha a traves del Alcalde, Gobernador,&#13;
funcionarios del MTCVC, o Coordinadores del Taller, pero es importante mantener consistente el&#13;
mensaje que se dice, que es el contenido de las instrucciones. Estas instrucciones diran mas o menos lo&#13;
siguiente:&#13;
"Esta es una invitaci6n a partcipar para todas aquellas organizaciones, ya sean gubernamentales&#13;
u ONGs, puiblicas o privadas, o aquellas personas, varones y mujeres, que tengan algo que ver con&#13;
la soluci6n de los problemas de transporte del drea Se trata de un Taller de Pardcipaci6n&#13;
Comunitaria donde se trabajard en grupos por espacio de seis horas por lo menos. Para todas las&#13;
personas de la comunidad, esta es una ocasi6n nuy importante, pues pernitira que opinen sobre&#13;
las mejoras necesarias a! sistema vial Tambien dardaoportunidad a la generaci6n de ideas para el&#13;
mejoramiento de los caminos de herradura, y la provision del mantenimiento continuado a los&#13;
caminos rurales a serrehabilitados pr6ximamente por elproyecto conjunto del BancoMundial, el&#13;
BID y d Gobierno del Per, "&#13;
INDICA CION PRA CTICA: En esta primera etapa, se debera hacer una lista lo mas exhaustiva&#13;
posible, sin excluir ninguin nombre. Si hubiera conflictos preexistentes entre uno o mas de los&#13;
representantes de los distintos intereses en el area, TODOS los involucrados en el conflicto&#13;
deben estar presentes. Dado que esta es una metodologia de diseflo participativo, la primera&#13;
indicaci6n es lograr la asistencia de todos los interesados en el tema. La exclusi6n a priori de&#13;
alguno de los involucrados legitimos puede dar lugar en elfuturo a mayores conflictos de&#13;
intereses que repercutiran en la ejecuci6n del proyecto. La convocatoria en nombre de la&#13;
rehabilitaci6n y mantenimiento de carreteras es de por si un tema tan significativo que&#13;
subordina a otros conflictos previos por intereses menores. Por otro lado, la exclusi6n, ya sea&#13;
deliberada o no intencional de uno de los involucrados es una descalificaci6n grave de su&#13;
liderazgo local, ypor lo tanto capaz de suscitar d6ficits de colaboraci6n en elfuturo inmediato.&#13;
Si estdn ausentes por alguna raz6n conocida, es urgente informarlos oportunamente de todo el&#13;
proceso realizado y obtener su apoyo.&#13;
ORGANIZACION DEL TALLER&#13;
3 .    A continuaci6n, se presentari una lista sintetica de los elementos a preparar con anticipaci6n al&#13;
Taller. Es importante repasar esta lista cuidadosamente, pues de su cumplimiento dependera el exito&#13;
de la reuni6n.&#13;
EQUIPO DE TALLER&#13;
4.     Este equipo consta de un Lider de Taller y varios coordinadores. La persona que hace de&#13;
Lider del Taller de Participaci6n Comunitaria no es por lo general la persona responsable del proyecto.&#13;
El numero de Coordinadores necesarios dependera del niimero de participantes que se haya logrado&#13;
reunir, y tamnbien de la ayuda disponible. Representantes de los Bancos en misi6n o de ONGs&#13;

observador-participante dentro de algun grupo. Su presencia como observadores-participantes es&#13;
invaluable, pues pueden ofrecer ideas--despues que el grupo haya hecho su propia busqueda--acerca de&#13;
otros procesos o soluciones similares alcanzados en otros lados. El rol de Coordinador tambien puede&#13;
ser desempefiado por los tecnicos del MTCVC, que son especialmente valiosos si son bilingues.&#13;
El rol del Lider de Taller es el siguiente:&#13;
a) Previo al Taller: (1) explicar los objetivos, metodologia y logistica del taller al&#13;
personal local; (2) coordinar los equipos encargados de preparar el Taller; (3)&#13;
seleccionar el sitio adecuado para realizar el Taller; (4) invitar personalmente a los&#13;
lideres de la comunidad; (5) supervisar la provisi6n de iutiles y refrigerios.&#13;
b) Durante el Taller: (1) Facilitar el Taller, ofreciendo a los participantes una&#13;
explicaci6n acerca del marco general del Taller de Participaci6n Comunitaria, sus&#13;
objetivos, prop6sitos, marco temporal y logistica; (2) explicar en cada etapa cuales&#13;
son los objetivos y los procedimientos a seguir; (3) motivar la participaci6n&#13;
entusiasta de todos los asistentes, proveyendo estimulo y apoyo a las ideas vertidas,&#13;
especialmente cuidando que aquellos asistentes que rara vez son tenidos en cuenta&#13;
puedan hablar; (4) al cierre, resumir en forma sencilla y comprensible los resultados&#13;
alcanzados, de modo que todos los participantes se lleven una idea clara de las&#13;
ideas creadas por consenso.&#13;
El rol de los Coordinadores es el siguiente:&#13;
a) Localizar el sitio para el Taller y asegurarse que tenga espacio suficiente y lugar en los&#13;
muros donde colgar los grificos.&#13;
b) Organizar a los participantes en grupos de trabajo, asegurando que haya el numero&#13;
adecuado de ellos, adecuada mezcla de varones y mujeres por grupo de trabajo e invitando&#13;
la participaci6n activa de todos. Tambien verificar que tengan mesas y sillas.&#13;
c) Proveer a los grupos de los materiales de trabajo necesarios en cada etapa, tales como&#13;
plumones y papel6grafos.&#13;
d) Recorrer los grupos mientras estan trabajando para asegurarse que se ha entendido la&#13;
consigna de trabajo y que todos estan aportando ideas. Aclarar dudas.&#13;
e) Verificar que la traducci6n de y hacia el castellano sea constante.&#13;
f) Recoger los graficos dibujados en papel6grafos y colgarlos de las paredes usando la cinta&#13;
engomada. Si hay necesidad, retirar los graficos producidos en la etapa anterior para hacer&#13;
lugar a los graficos de la etapa subsiguiente.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

MATERIALES NECESARIOS&#13;
5.    Hojas de papel blanco tamanio rotafoio, (70 cm. x 89 cm.), o mas grande, en cantidad de tres&#13;
por cada grupo. Marcadores de colores en cantidad necesaria, uno por cada integrante. Tarjetas&#13;
comunes de cartulina, ( 12.5 cm. x 8 cm.), en cantidad de por lo menos tres por cada participante,&#13;
usadas del lado liso, sin renglones. Cinta adhesiva transparente, de tipo grueso para sostener las hojas&#13;
de rotafoho a la pared, un rollo. Cinta adhesiva transparente comuin para sostener las tarjetas a las&#13;
hojas de rotafolio.&#13;
HORARIO&#13;
6.    El Taller de Participaci6n Comunitaria es una experiencia que toma todo el dia. Posiblemente&#13;
habra que citar a las personas para un reuni6n que comienza a las 9 de la manana, sabiendo que las&#13;
dificultades del transporte haran posible el inicio formal recien a las 10:00 horas. Incluyendo una pausa&#13;
para el almuerzo, se tratara de terminar la reuni6n alrededor de las 4:00. La raz6n para esta hora de&#13;
finalizaci6n es permitir que las personas tengan por lo menos dos horas de luz de dia para volver&#13;
caminando con seguridad a sus hogares. Se preguntara especialmente si este horario presenta&#13;
problemas para familias con nifios, y se prevera un sitio que pueda responder a esos problemas.&#13;
BUSQUEDA DE UN SMO ADECUADO&#13;
7.    Dado que se promueve la mayor participaci6n posible, identificar un sitio donde se pueda&#13;
acomodar a todos es problematico. Sin embargo, es importantisimo que se tenga un solo sitio, no&#13;
dos salas o tres aulas. Hacer talleres simultaneos promueve aislamiento y falta de consenso. Por lo&#13;
tanto, si no se puede hacer bajo techo, se identificari la plaza de la comunidad, el atrio de la iglesia&#13;
local u otro sitio abierto donde todas los participantes puedan congregarse. Se dispondran de mesas y&#13;
sillas en numero adecuado, recordando que para cada mesa habri siete u ocho sillas. Dado que el&#13;
maximo nuimero de personas activamente enroladas en trabajo grupal no pasa de 7 u 8, se tratara de&#13;
dividir el nuimero de participantes por 8 para saber el numero de grupos y por lo tanto el nuimero de&#13;
mesas necesarias. A veces la adici6n espontanea de otras personas que ilegan mas tarde provee a los&#13;
grupos de circulos que los rodean. A estas personas se les debe explicar expresamente que su propia&#13;
participaci6n es bienvenida, no solo como espectadores de la dinamica grupal, sino como participantes&#13;
activos.&#13;
EXHIBICION DE LOS GRAFICOS GRUPALES&#13;
8.    Dado que el proceso grupal del Taller de Participaci6n Comunitaria depende de manera&#13;
importante en el propio feedback, exhibici6n de los trabajos grupales es una parte importante del&#13;
proceso. Hay que buscar un sitio con muros alrededor de donde se puedan colgar los graficos, y desde&#13;
donde el representante de cada grupo pueda explicar las ideas a las que arribaron en conjunto. Si no&#13;
hay muros, se podra implementar un soporte de los grificos con una armaz6n de tipo rotafolio,&#13;
claramente visible por todos los demas. Igualmente se debera verificar que la acuistica permita a todos&#13;
los participantes escuchar la explicaci6n del representante grupal. Habiendo espacio mural suficiente,&#13;
los graficos de la etapa I (Arbol de problemas) y los graficos de la etapa II (Arbol de Objetivos)&#13;
permaneceran colgados mientras se trabaja en la etapa m ( Propuestas y Soluciones). Si no hubiera&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
lugar suficiente, tan pronto como todos los representantes grupales han pasado a exponer su trabajo en&#13;
la etapa I, se quitan los grificos para dar lugar a colgar los de la etapa II, y sucesivamente se hace lo&#13;
mismo para colgar los de la etapa Im. Estos quedan colgados hasta el final del Taller.&#13;
REFRIGERIOS&#13;
9.    Los participantes de las comunidades invitadas posiblemente concurran al Taller de&#13;
Participaci6n Comunitaria usando medios de transporte propios, usualmente caminando varios&#13;
kil6metros por la serrania. Es importante incluir en la programacion un refrigerio o almuerzo servido a&#13;
todos. Se puede organizar este refrigerio a traves del alcalde local, dando a esta persona los recursos&#13;
adecuados para que compre los elementos de comida y organice su preparaci6n con el trabajo de&#13;
personas de la comunidad, o se puede encargar la preparaci6n a algun pequefno negocio de comidas del&#13;
sitio. Hay que calcular en el numero de refrigerios servidos un 10-15% extra para los casos de&#13;
menores que acompasan a los participantes. Es conveniente informar a los participantes desde el inicio&#13;
del taller acerca de la distribuci6n del tiempo y de la inclusi6n de tiempo para el almuerzo y la provisi6n&#13;
de este.&#13;
DIFCULTADES IDIOMATICAS&#13;
10.   Es posible que el idioma de los involucrados en del Taller de Participaci6n Comunitaria no sea&#13;
el castellano. Hay que hacer las adecuadas previsiones para asegurar la traducci6n constante de las&#13;
consignas y de las respuestas de los participantes de y hacia el idioma local. Posiblemente este sea&#13;
trabajo del alcalde o de alguien que el designe en el mismo momento de iniciaci6n del Taller. Si los&#13;
participantes explican los graficos en quichua u otro idioma local, hay que conseguir un traductor para&#13;
la persona del equipo de Taller que esta tomando notas de las ideas expresadas.&#13;
lNVITACION A LA PARTICIPACION DE TODOS&#13;
11.   Un problema especial lo presenta el variable grado de analfabetismo de los participantes, y es&#13;
por lo tanto conveniente verificar que haya alguien en el grupo que sepa escribir. Esto resuelve el&#13;
problema de la escritura de las ideas grupales, pero puede presentar otros problemas. A pesar de que&#13;
el ejercicio comienza con dibujos, muchas personas de escasa o nula escolaridad se auto excluyen del&#13;
proceso por una falsa sensaci6n de incapacidad, dejando el liderazgo automatico del grupo a la persona&#13;
que sabe escribir. Esta persona puede o no representar fielmente a las ideas de todos. Los&#13;
Coordinadores deberan tener cuidado de ir personalmente grupo por grupo y estimular la participaci6n&#13;
de todos. Especialmente las participantes mujeres pueden ofrecer un consentimniento silencioso, por lo&#13;
cual es necesario estimularlas a expresar verbalmente o graficamente sus ideas. Ayuda el proveer de&#13;
marcadores o plumones de colores, y tarjetas, a TODOS los integrantes, sepan o no escribir.&#13;
Lista de posibles involucrados en el Peru&#13;
12.   Se haran las invitaciones a los involucrados correspondientes dependiendo del tipo de&#13;
proyecto. Esta es solamente una lista provisional, para dar una idea del amplio ambito de distintos&#13;
involucrados que los temas de transporte pueden tener en el Peru. Tentativamente los posibles&#13;
involucrados pueden incluir: Ministerio de Transportes; Gobierno regional; Ministerio de Agricultura&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
(PROMANECH); PRONAA (Club de Madres, Vaso de Leche); Empresas de transporte de carga y&#13;
pasajeros; PAR, FONCODES, COOPOP y ONGs locales; Alcaldes y autoridades politicas; Colegios&#13;
profesionales (Ingenieros, Economistas); firmas de ingenieria (consultoria, planificaci6n y&#13;
construcci6n); firmas de alquiler de equipo pesado; iglesias; autoridades escolares; demas dirigentes de&#13;
las comunidades involucradas.&#13;
DESARROLLO DEL TALLER DE PARTICIPACION COMUNITARIA&#13;
COMIENZO&#13;
13.   Una vez instalados los involucrados en el local elegido, es conveniente preparar las&#13;
introducciones y presentaciones formales en el orden jerarquico correspondiente. Asi, el Alcalde, o el&#13;
gobemador si el Alcalde no esta presente, presentara a los funcionarios del MTCVC, a los enviados del&#13;
BM y/o BID y al Equipo del Taller, respectivamente. Es importante que el representante del&#13;
Ministerio de MTCVC haga una breve descripci6n del proyecto, su importancia para la comunidad y la&#13;
necesidad de incluir la participaci6n de los involucrados a fin de tener un proyecto viable y sostenible.&#13;
A continuaci6n, el Facilitador procederA a explicar la consigna de la Etapa I.&#13;
INDICACIONPRACTICA: Es importante agradecer especialmente que los concurrentes&#13;
suspendieran sus labores productivas, familias y tareas domesticas y caminaran una distancia&#13;
considerable para poder estar presentes.&#13;
ETAPA I: (Duraci6n: entre 45' y una hora)&#13;
14.   En la primera parte de esta fase, los representantes de los involucrados hacen un diagnostico&#13;
del estado del sistema de transportes, tal como los afecta a ellos. La persona que facilita el Taller los&#13;
invita a reunirse en pequefios grupos de hasta 8 personas, mezclando personas provenientes de&#13;
diferentes instituciones o comunidades. El Facilitador dice: "Les agradezco nuevamente haber venido&#13;
y su colaboraci6n con el proyecto. A fin de que todos sepamnos como es la situaci6n actual y cuales&#13;
son los problemas que tenemos, los invito a conversar dentro de su grupo sobre las dificultades mas&#13;
habituales. Cuando hayan hablado todos, haran un dibujo sobre este papel que represente los&#13;
problemas de transporte que todos experimentan. Para finalizar esta etapa, discutiremos los trabajos&#13;
grupales en publico. No es importante el talento artistico de los participantes, sino que digan todo lo&#13;
que tengan que expresar.&#13;
INDICACION PRACTICA: Mezclar a las personas es muy importante, pues da un acceso no&#13;
habitual a distintos niveles de involucrados. El prop6sito de esta modalidad es crear un&#13;
acercamiento artificial que pueda abrir vias de comunicacion diferentes a las habituales.&#13;
15.   El facilitador invita a los grupos a conversar por espacio de cierto tiempo, acerca de sus&#13;
problemas en el area del transporte. El tiempo dedicado a esta actividad depende de los grupos, pero&#13;
no deberia ser mas de veinte minutos. A partir de un cierto consenso acerca de experiencias comunes,&#13;
se invita a los grupos a componer un dibujo unico que sintetice las experiencias personales de todos los&#13;
integrantes. Se reitera que lo importante es la creaci6n grupal y no el grado de talento artistico que&#13;
puedan desplegar. Se permite que agreguen palabras si lo hacen espontaneamente, pero esto no es&#13;
sugerido en publico. Los Coordinadores recorren los grupos para invitar a todos a dibujar en el mismo&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147-&#13;
papel, y al nmismo tiempo verifican que todos los dibujos tengan un numero consecutivo y que incluyan&#13;
las firmas de los asistentes. En este momento es tambien conveniente hacer circular una hoja en limpio&#13;
donde los asistentes escribiran sus nombres, organizaciones y/o comunidades a las que pertenecen.&#13;
Al finalizar el tiempo, se cuelgan los papel6grafos sobre los muros por medio de la cinta fuerte&#13;
engomada. Cuando todos los grificos grupales se han expuesto, se pide silencio y se invita a un&#13;
representante del Grupo Numero 1, y asi sucesivamente, a exponer en publico el significado del grifico&#13;
grupal. Los demas escuchan en silencio. Al finalizar la exposici6n, se invita al publico en general a&#13;
formular preguntas al representante de este grupo acerca de los significados de su grafico. Se termina&#13;
de este modo con la exposici6n del uiltimo grafico perteneciente al ultimo grupo. Un Coordinador&#13;
toma notas de las expresiones grupales.&#13;
INDICA CION PRA CTICA: Lo importante de este momento es que los grupos se escuchen&#13;
mutuamente y perciban cuan compartidos son sus problemas. Oir a otros describiendo&#13;
problemas comunes esfundamental para tener un diagnostico consensuado de lo que anda mal&#13;
en la comunidad Todos los dibujos son validos. Elfacilitador tiene que asegurar que todos&#13;
atienden las exposicionesy que los expositores grupales no sean siempre los mismos.&#13;
ETAPA II: (Duraci6n: 30' a 45' minutos)&#13;
16.   Los participantes retoman a los mismos grupos del ejercicio anterior. Ahora el facilitador los&#13;
invita de esta manera a] siguiente ejercicio:&#13;
"Ustedes han visto la cantidad de problemas de transporte que afectan a esta comunidad. Ahora&#13;
supongamos que todos estanos viviendo en el ano 2000, y que estos problemas se han solucionado.&#13;
Los invito a pensar como serian sus comunidades, una vez servidas por excelentes servicios de&#13;
transporte. Cada grupo va a elaborar un dibujo conjunto que represente a esa comunidad del futuro, y&#13;
despues los explicaremos en pulblico."&#13;
INDICACION PRACTICA: Los participantes reciben indicaciones de no poner limites a su&#13;
visi6n ideal, o de no fijar un limite de liempo demasiado estricto a la visi6n. El objetivo es&#13;
estimular la creauividad grupal, promoviendo la expresi6n de sus deseos, a travis de la&#13;
discusion y el dibujo. No se hace ningon intento de producir una uinica visi6n, sino que cada&#13;
grupo produce una diferente.&#13;
17.   Esta Etapa II temmina con la exposici6n grupal de los diferentes grificos, desde el nuimero 1 al&#13;
ultimo, invitando a exponer a diferentes personas, una por cada grupo, como voceros grupales. El&#13;
resto del publico es invitado a hacer preguntas o comentarios, con el prop6sito de promover&#13;
identificaci6n mutua entre las visiones de un futuro positivo. El publico adquiere la noci6n de que&#13;
todos comparten visiones parecidas del futuro posible para la comunidad.&#13;
Al final de la Etapa II es posible ofrecer un refrigerio o el almuerzo, dando asi oportunidad para que los&#13;
participantes conversen un poco mas entre ellos. (Idealmente, este intermedio deberia tomar no mas de&#13;
30').&#13;
ETAPA mI: (Duraci6n: entre 45' y una hora)&#13;
18.   Una vez servido el refrigerio, se invitara a los participantes a tomar ubicaci6n en nuevos&#13;
grupos, esta vez distribuidos de acuerdo a la instituci6n, comunidad o interes que los agrupa, sin&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
prestar atenci6n al nuimero. Es posible que haya grupos de dos o quince personas, todas pertenecientes&#13;
a la misma organizaci6n o campo de trabajo.&#13;
INDICACION PRACTICA: Los grupos homogeneos tienen por finalidad poner a trabajar las&#13;
mismas habilidades enfocadas en un punto. Teniendo formaci6n y/o perspectivas comunes&#13;
ayuda a proponer soluciones de manera rapida. No se ponen limites al tipo de ideas que se&#13;
escriben, todas son validas.&#13;
19.    Ahora se los invita a trabajar de la siguiente manera: "Tenemos ante nosotros los graficos que&#13;
nos muestran como es la comunidad del futuro que todos sonamos. Es importante que pensemos&#13;
ahora cuales son las decisiones, acciones y trabajos que tienen que hacerse ahora para Ilegar a ese&#13;
resultado del ano 2000. Por favor, imaginense viviendo en ese futuro, miren para taras e identifiquen&#13;
los eventos claves que tuvieron que darse para Ilegar a ese futuro. Tambien pensaremos en cuales son&#13;
los recursos que la comunidad posee y que podriamos usar para conseguir este futuro. Tienen sobre la&#13;
mesa una cantidad de tarjetas blancas. Escriban esas ideas, todas las que sea posible, en las tarjetas,&#13;
solamente una idea por tarjeta  Conversen luego entre ustedes y decidan cuales son las ideas mas&#13;
apropiadas para realizar ese futuro sonado. Cuando no haya mas ideas que escribir, las fijaremos al&#13;
papel6grafo que les entregaremos, formando un esquema de trabajo."&#13;
INDICACION PRACTICA: Mirando desde el futuro hacia el pasado, se ven claramente los&#13;
sucesos claves que deberan ocurrir, incluyendo cambios en la propia conducta personal o&#13;
institucional. El hecho de que se mezclan TODAS las tarjetas producidas individualmente y se&#13;
las trata sin distinci6n de autor asegura la universalizaci6n de las ideas, que ahora pertenecen&#13;
al grupo. Esto facilitara la aceptaci6n de la estrategia producida por el grupo, de parte de&#13;
todos sus integrantes, como si fuera la propia.&#13;
20.    El facilitador invita a los grupos a llegar a un consenso sobre los eventos que tendran que darse&#13;
para llegar al futuro deseado, cuando ofrece la hoja de papel y los invita a pegar las tarjetas&#13;
seleccionadas por el grupo. Si es posible, el orden de las tarjetas sobre el papel6grafo tiene que reflejar&#13;
una relaci6n de medios a fines: "haremos esto, para lograr esto otro," y asi sucesivamente.&#13;
INDICA CION PRA CTICA: Al fijar las tarjetas sobre el papel se identificaran aquellas que&#13;
proponen la misma idea, de las cuales se elegirM la mas precisa, eliminando las repetidas. Las&#13;
tarjetas que quedan, son los eventos sobre los cuales se tiene consenso grupal y representan asi&#13;
las prioridades a realizar en el plan estrategico. Es un momento importante pues en los grupos&#13;
m6s dinamicos se ver6n procesos de negociaci6n interna entre las distintas ideas. Esto es&#13;
necesario para llegar a las decisiones consensuadas sobre que hay que hacer primero, y para&#13;
que hacerlo. A ch se tiene el proceso de diseho grupal de un futuro comun a la vista. Los&#13;
coordinadores tienen especialmente que cuidar que todas las estrategias tengan oportunidad de&#13;
ser discutidas por todos.&#13;
21.    Al ilegar a este punto, el facilitador tiene que estar seguro que todos los intereses representados&#13;
en el grupo han tenido ocasi6n de ser debidamente oidos, especialmente la voz de los participantes en&#13;
desventaja, tales como los representantes de los usuarios pobres, o las representantes de los Clubes de&#13;
Madres. Como esta etapa contiene los prop6sitos de acci6n especifica para cada interes, es muy&#13;
importante que se acentue el hecho de que las estrategias presentadas, si bien creativas, deben estar&#13;
dentro del alcance de la acci6n propia. Idealmente, cada grupo propondra aquellas estrategias que,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149-&#13;
dentro de su ambito de acci6n, son imprescindibles para lograr el futuro deseado, y que estan&#13;
motivados a emprender.&#13;
INDICACION PRACTICA: Si el proceso ha sido motivador, los grupos espont6neamente&#13;
propondran aquellos cambios en su conducta habitual que son los necesarios para producir el&#13;
futuro.  En las comunidades hay ideas que hace mucho estan esperando una decisi6n&#13;
compartida que las ponga en practica. Hasta ahora, lo que ha faltado es el consenso y la&#13;
motivacion. Los coordinadores recorreran los grupos invitando a las personas a describir todos&#13;
los cambios necesarios y posibles, dentro de instituciones ya existentes. Tambien podran&#13;
proponerse entidades nuevas, si las funciones necesarias para el cambio no se incluyen en&#13;
organizaciones actuales.&#13;
ETAPA IV: Sesi6n Plenaria: (Duraci6n: 15' a 30' minutos)&#13;
22.   Uno de los Coordinadores, o el Lider del Taller explicara las estrategias que resulten evidentes&#13;
despu6s de leer las tarjetas y organizadas sobre el papel6grafo. La tarea defacilitador es organizar&#13;
las propuestas de modo que caigan bajo dos o tres lineas de categoras de cambios bien definidos .&#13;
Tambi6n podra combinar dos propuestas de modo de formar una general que tenga mas sentido.&#13;
Mientras se va explicando, o al final de las exposiciones, el facilitador movera los papel6grafos de&#13;
modo de presentarlos en un orden l6gico de operaciones. La idea es que aqui se describa, aunque sea&#13;
en fineas muy simples, un plan estrategico de acciones sucesivas destinadas a implementar un plan de&#13;
mantenimiento de los caminos rurales por la comunidad. Dando un ejemplo: el primer papel6grafo&#13;
puede contener las tarjetas dando la idea de la constituci6n de los Comites Comunales de&#13;
Mantenimiento Vial, el segundo papel6grafo tendra las tarjetas que aluden a los modos de&#13;
funcionamiento de dichos Comites; el siguiente mostrara las ideas para obtener apoyo extemo a los&#13;
proyectos y el ultimo papel6grafo contendra las tarjetas que se refieren a los procesos de educaci6n de&#13;
la comunidad sobre el proyecto comuin. Aquellas tarjetas que no coinciden exactamente con las&#13;
categorias elegidas, pero que si tienen algo que ver, se las incluye en un papel6grafo extra Hlamado&#13;
"Ideas Varias", como podria ser, por ejemplo, un papel6grafo mostrando las ideas relacionadas con el&#13;
mejoramiento de los caminos de herradura. Las tarjetas no relacionadas se descartan. Una vez que se&#13;
tiene lista esta lectura de los emergentes de los grupos, se la explica al auditorio de manera clara y&#13;
sencilla, ("Parece que ustedes, reunidos en grupos, piensan que se podria hacer esto y lo otro...") y&#13;
luego se hace una invitaci6n formal a discutir las ideas surgidas.&#13;
INDICA CION PRA CTICA: Es importante que esto sea hecho de modo tal que los grupos hagan&#13;
preguntas y pidan explicaciones, de modo defavorecer que se vean cada vez mas involucrados&#13;
en el planeamiento conjunto del programa de acci6n. De la habilidad del Lider del Taller o de&#13;
los Coordinadores dependera que los asistentes se vayan con la percepci6n de haber creado&#13;
comunitariamente el esbozo del plan de accion que les permitira tener intervencion directa en el&#13;
mantenimiento de los caminos.&#13;
23.   En este momento conviene ampliar la informaci6n disponible por el publico acerca de los&#13;
procedimientos formales del Banco relativos al comienzo de las obras, el n(umero de personas de la&#13;
comunidad que intervendran en micro-empresas o como operarios, mas una evaluaci6n del tiempo que&#13;
tomara implementar los planes del Banco junto con los de la comunidad. Es muy importante que aqui&#13;
se informe a los presentes sobre aspectos del prestamo relacionados con el fomento de las micro-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150-&#13;
empresas y tambien sobre la inclusi6n de mano de obra local par trabajos pagos de rehabilitaci6n de&#13;
caminos.&#13;
INDICACION PRACTICA: En el modelo original de participaci6n comunitaria (A-I-C)&#13;
desarrollado por W. E. Smith, en esta Etapa el ejercicio finaliza cuando se encarga a los&#13;
asistentes, agrupados, las tareas inherentes al plan de acci6n. En las cuatro aplicaciones&#13;
practicas hecha por esta misi6n en Peru en Mayo 1995, dos con comunidades campesinas y dos&#13;
con las fuerzas vivas de Cusco y Huancavelica, fue imposible plantear este nivel de compromiso.&#13;
Dado que es un proceso progresivo, quizais en sucesivas reuniones se pueda encargar tareas.&#13;
Idealmente se deberfa terminar con una lista de tare as distribuidas por equipos,&#13;
homogeneizados por su pertenencia institucional o sus tareas profesionales.&#13;
CIERRE DEL TALLER&#13;
24.    El Lider del Taller agradecera a los asistentes su presencia al Taller, y dari oportunidad para&#13;
que las otras autoridades, Alcalde, Gobernador, enviados del BM, etc., cierren sucesivarnente el Taller.&#13;
INDICACIONPRACTICA: Es importante aqui transmitir que este es el primer encuentro de una&#13;
serie que garantizard la comunicaci6n entre los beneficiariosy los ejecutores, a lo largo de los&#13;
cinco ailos del Proyecto La comunidad tiene que percibir el interes no espor6dico sino constante&#13;
del Banco, de incluir su participaci6n de manera org6nica que asegure la sostenibilidad del&#13;
proyecto.&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Economic Evaluation And Eligibility Criteria&#13;
General Appraisal Methodology&#13;
25.   Rural roads are often lightly traveled and provide access to villages that are distant and&#13;
costly to reach. The economic feasibility evaluation of rural roads should be based on foundations&#13;
different from those for trunk networks. Two general types of investments in rural roads can be&#13;
identified. One is the feeder-road type, which involves the rehabilitation or new construction of&#13;
roads connecting existing farms, or areas of known agricultural potential, with already functional&#13;
secondary or trunk roads. The main objectives of this type of rural road investment are, first, to&#13;
reduce transport costs for existing volumes of agricultural output; and second, to increase&#13;
agricultural production by means of inducing a decrease in agricultural input prices. The other&#13;
type of rural road investment is the access-and-development road, which is intended to "jump-&#13;
start" remote rural areas inhabited by poor communities living off a subsistence economy. The&#13;
objective of these rural roads is to provide those poor communities with the opportunity to&#13;
market their potential agricultural surplus, as well as access to other services, such as health and&#13;
education, that are not provided in situ. The latter have a strong social policy purpose; the former&#13;
have the aim of reaching areas of potential, agricultural development. The project includes roads&#13;
of both types and hence the eligibility methodology incorporates criteria that attend the objectives&#13;
of both types of rural roads.&#13;
26.   In Peru, where over two third of rural households are poor, investments in rural roads are&#13;
a major element of any poverty-eradication strategy. For those roads with low total and per-km&#13;
costs, the appraisal methodology will rely on the assessment of readily-available poverty&#13;
indicators. For those other roads or network of roads (including departmental links) with higher&#13;
total costs and an agricultural-production focus, the appraisal methodology will follow simplified&#13;
economic appraisal procedures based on the measurement of producer surplus.&#13;
Description of Eligibility Procedures and Criteria&#13;
27.   Projects would be generated by the requests of communities and local organizations&#13;
(municipalities and NGOs) and their concept, including the main parameters of the proposed&#13;
investment, submitted to the de-concentrated executing units (UEDs) of the PERT-PCR. The&#13;
UEDs would analyze the sub-project concept and, once approved by the UTED, initiate, along with&#13;
the proponent (see participatory procedures in Annex 10) and through contracts with local&#13;
consultants, the collection of information for the evaluation of the eligibility of the proposal and&#13;
the definition of its technical specifications. At the conceptual level, a sub-project would be put&#13;
into the context of other rural development programs and of other rural road projects toward&#13;
maximizing the impact of a particular proposal. When in performing this analysis, an additional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
sub-project is identified by the UEDs, these units would pursue consultations with the&#13;
communities in the sub-project's area of influence towards (a) validating their commitment to the&#13;
sub-project, (b) incorporating local needs into the sub-project design, and (c) initiating the&#13;
organization of the posterior maintenance activities. To ensure the sustainability of the&#13;
investments, only those roads for which the community agrees with its design and is committed to&#13;
its future maintenance would be subject to the complete eligibility criteria.&#13;
28.   Four main criteria would be considered by the UEDs to evaluate the eligibility of the&#13;
project proposals, namely: institutional criteria, technical criteria, social criteria, and economic&#13;
criteria (which attempt to capture production-related benefits). The detailed definition of these&#13;
criteria would be explained in the Operational Manual of the project with the objective of allowing&#13;
the UEDs to uniformly and objectively apply the same yardstick to the approval of projects across&#13;
the different regions of Peru. The application of those criteria to identify the sub-projects of the&#13;
Project should allow to select, first, those low-cost works with a strong social purpose and,&#13;
second, those larger-scale works (on the basis of total costs and cost per km) that have a proven&#13;
worthiness in terms of their contribution to the potential increase in the agricultural and economic&#13;
development of their influence area (thus ensuring the adequate use of scarce resources).&#13;
Furthermore, those criteria, alongside with the process of project generation, would allow to&#13;
select sub-projects that will have a good chance of being sustainable. (See flow chart in&#13;
Attachment 1.)&#13;
29.   The institutional criteria refer to the level of identification the communities in the area of&#13;
influence of a particular sub-project would have with the road sub-project, including the degree of&#13;
commitment to the future maintenance of those roads. The level of identification and&#13;
commitment would be evaluated on the basis of different factors depending on the type of sub-&#13;
project, as follows:&#13;
(d)   For those projects that involve the paving of village streets, the commitment would&#13;
be ensured by requiring local co-financing of the street works above certain cost&#13;
threshold and by the expression of interest in contributing to the execution of those&#13;
works (e.g., through the provision of labor inputs). These proposals would have&#13;
to be in the proximity of other rural roads sub-projects (either already executed or&#13;
in consideration for execution). The Project would finance the amount&#13;
corresponding to specified types of investment and would require, as indicated&#13;
above, the contribution of the community if a maximum amount is surpassed.&#13;
(e)   For the road rehabilitation sub-projects, the commitment would take place to the&#13;
extent that these project are identified and presented by the communities&#13;
themselves and are validated through the schemes for local participation detailed in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual (and summarized in Annex 10).&#13;
(f)    For the road maintenance works, the commitment would be structured through the&#13;
creation of micro-enterprises consisting of laborers from the communities in the&#13;
area of influence of the roads. The process of creation and training of these micro-&#13;
enterprises would be further detailed in the Project Operational Manual. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
financing of the maintenance works would be initially covered with funds from the&#13;
Project; incrementally, however, the local communities would have to finance&#13;
these works through instruments that would be defined under a technical assistance&#13;
sub-component of the Project.&#13;
30.   Complementing the above-mentioned criteria, preference would be given to those sub-&#13;
projects that are expected to be executed in geographical areas where other rural-related projects&#13;
(such as extension programs, irrigation projects, etc.) are slated for implementation, with an aim&#13;
at maximizing the socio-economic impact of the rural road sub-projects.&#13;
31.   The technical criteria refer to the construction characteristics of the proposed sub-projects&#13;
and their functionality within the road network in the pertinent province or department. The&#13;
construction (or technological) characteristics would be defined to undertake works that, first, can&#13;
be adequately maintained at the local level and that, second, can maximize the use of local labor.&#13;
In this respect, the construction and maintenance costs of the proposed sub-projects would have&#13;
to keep relation with the expected benefits of the road (as would then be assessed with the&#13;
application of the socio-economic criteria). Furthermore, the proposed sub-projects would be&#13;
analyzed--as specified in the Project Operational Manual--within the context of the broader&#13;
transport network and, in particular, of the connection of the road to market and/or production&#13;
centers of the province or department, with the objective of defining connected "trees" of rural&#13;
roads and, when necessary, of departmental roads with the objective of maximizing the economic&#13;
and transport benefits of the investments.&#13;
32.   Both the institutional and the technical criteria are largely of a narrative nature; specific&#13;
guidelines are incorporated into the Project Operation Manual regarding the maximum amount&#13;
that can be disbursed for the rehabilitation of village streets and the feasible technical standards&#13;
for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the rural roads. Though proposals would have to&#13;
include a satisfactory program for the future maintenance of the rehabilitated works, the UEDs'&#13;
analysts would be ultimately responsible for assessing the level of commitment at the local level,&#13;
the coordination with other rural sector programs, and the functionality of the road network.&#13;
33.   The social criteria would be applied to those sub-project with total cost and cost per&#13;
kilometer below certain thresholds. The pilot and first-year programs included roads which had&#13;
been selected purely on the basis of geographic (provincial) poverty indicators, mainly those&#13;
related to infant mortality rates and unsatisfied basic needs. For the rest of the sub-projects, the&#13;
evaluator would analyze the total amount of the investment, the cost per kilometer, and the&#13;
population density per kilometer of road to identify those projects which would be evaluated&#13;
solely on the basis of two poverty indicators: infant mortality rate and level of unsatisfied basic&#13;
needs (as described and documented by the 1993 Census of Population). The parameters that&#13;
define the limits under which a sub-project would be considered for evaluation based on those&#13;
poverty indicators and the eligibility thresholds for the poverty indicators are based of the analysis&#13;
of the projects being implemented under the pilot program. Those projects with a total cost&#13;
below US$200,000 and a cost per kilometer below US$8,500 would become eligible if they are&#13;
located in areas with infant mortality rates greater than 80, unsatisfied basic needs greater than&#13;
70% and a number of beneficiaries per kilometer greater than 100. (The poverty indicators would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154-&#13;
be calculated taken into consideration the provinces traversed by the proposed road and pro-&#13;
rating the provincial indicators on the basis of the kilometers of road in each province.)&#13;
Nonetheless, the projects would be analyzed as indicated in the previous paragraph in terms of&#13;
their technical feasibility and the convenience of including them with other sub-projects in the&#13;
same geographic area towards defining a functional "tree" of roads (rural and departmental) and,&#13;
hence, maximizing the socio-economic impact of the proposed sub-project. When this "tree" is&#13;
identified, it may happen that the cost of the overall project may become higher than the&#13;
investment limits for the lone consideration of social criteria (i.e., poverty indicators); it this event,&#13;
the "new" sub-project (now a "tree") would be evaluated against the economic criteria described&#13;
below.&#13;
34.   The economic criteria refer to the relation of the rehabilitation and maintenance costs of&#13;
the sub-project and the benefits that the sub-project would bring about in terms of the increase of&#13;
the net agricultural and livestock production (net of the local consumption and of production&#13;
costs) in the area of influence of the sub-project. The procedures for the application of the socio-&#13;
economic criteria would be included into the Project Operational Manual in a spreadsheet within&#13;
which all the input variables and parameters would be specified, including the sources from which&#13;
specific information would be derived and the values of the pertinent conversion factors. On the&#13;
basis of this information, the internal economic rate of return of the sub-project would be&#13;
calculated. The project would be eligible if the rate of return is higher than 10%. The 10%&#13;
benchmark has been selected on the basis that, first, the projects have a strong social focus and,&#13;
second, not all the production-related benefits would be quantified (for instance, the economic&#13;
calculations would be based on the major 5 agricultural products in the area).&#13;
35.   The application of the economic criteria consists of the following steps: (a) calculation of&#13;
the number of hectares cultivated around an approximately five-kilometer band along the&#13;
proposed road for the five major agricultural products as well as the production of livestock and&#13;
milk if this production if of any significance in the road area-of-influence; (b) estimation of the&#13;
increase in the area of production once the project were constructed and/or any possible increase&#13;
in productivity (e.g., agricultural yields), ensuring that the increase in agricultural land does not&#13;
take place at the expense of clearing natural forests or within legally protected areas; (c) definition&#13;
of the percentage of the production that stays in the area for local consumption, with and without&#13;
the project; (d) quantification of the production costs of the agricultural and livestock output,&#13;
with and without the project; (e) reporting of the sales prices for the produced agricultural and&#13;
livestock goods without the project and estimation of these prices for the situation with the&#13;
project; (f) calculation of the existing and with-project costs of transporting the marketed&#13;
products (through data on prevailing freight tariffs); (g) inputting the costs of rehabilitating the&#13;
road and of the future routine and periodic maintenance costs, including any possible&#13;
environmental-mitigation costs; (h) developing, for every year up to the horizon year of analysis&#13;
(normally 10 years after the completion of the rehabilitation project), a table for each product&#13;
showing the with and without project values for marketed production (net of local consumption),&#13;
production costs, and net value added; (i) application of the corresponding conversion factors (for&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance costs, costs of agricultural and livestock production, sales prices,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 155 -&#13;
and transport costs) to generate a similar number of tables with economic values ', (j) calculation&#13;
of the annual net value added through the consolidation of the product tables; (k) calculation of&#13;
the annual net flow of economic benefits by subtracting from the net value added the economic&#13;
costs of rehabilitation and maintenance; and, finally, (1) calculation of the net present value for the&#13;
stream of net benefits and the corresponding economic rate of return. This methodology has been&#13;
applied to most sub-projects of the pilot and the findings are summarized in the next section.&#13;
36.   It is expected that the described eligibility criteria would generate a list of projects that is&#13;
evenly distributed among the different departments of Peru and among the various project&#13;
components (e.g., between investments on village streets and on the rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of rural roads). The bi-annual performance evaluation of the executed sub-projects&#13;
would allow to assess the production impact of the road rehabilitation works--one year after they&#13;
are completed--and test the adequacy of the poverty thresholds. At each annual review, an&#13;
assessment would be performed to confirm these expectations and to incorporate the necessary&#13;
adjustments to both the participatory process of project generation and the eligibility&#13;
methodology.&#13;
The Pilot Program&#13;
37.   Twenty five studies of the pilot, located in four different departments, representing 76&#13;
percent of the kilometers and 70 percent of the costs of the pilot, were analyzed with an aim at&#13;
evaluating their technical quality and estimate the socio-economic feasibility of the corresponding&#13;
sub-projects. The studies contained a vast amount of information--in some cases beyond that&#13;
necessary to carry out a satisfactory technical and socio-economic feasibility analysis--and the&#13;
quality, except for a few exceptions was satisfactory. For the future, a clear definition of the data&#13;
to be collected (within the Project Operational Manual) and the incorporation of templates to&#13;
undertake this activity should facilitate the consultants' assignment and lead to uniformity in the&#13;
type of information gathered.&#13;
38.   Under the pilot studies, the uniformity of data collection, in spite of originating in different&#13;
departments and having been gathered by different consultants, has been satisfactory. Data&#13;
related to the existing conditions of the agricultural production show values around a 65%&#13;
bracket around the average value. The largest discrepancies were presented in the data of&#13;
agricultural production costs, for which six of the eleven products analyzed fell outside the 65%&#13;
bracket. (This may, however, largely reflects actual differences in the costs of production across&#13;
different regions.) In the future, the incorporation of standard values should allow to confirm the&#13;
consultant-provided data and ensure uniformity across all the studies. The Third National&#13;
Agricultural and Livestock Survey--with definite results to be published by end 1995--will permit&#13;
to incorporate to the project data base precise standards for productivity, production costs, and&#13;
farm gate prices for the relevant agricultural products.&#13;
Costs of construction and maintenance have a conversion factor of 0.72 to reflect taxes (IGV) and a 25% of&#13;
unskilled labor to which a conversion factor of 0.5 is applied. Agricultural and livestock production costs have&#13;
a conversion factor of 0.75 to reflect a 50% of unskilled labor to which a conversion factor of 0.5 is applied.&#13;
Finally, transport costs have a conversion factor of 0.9 to reflect market distortions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156-&#13;
39.    The studies establish assumptions in relation to the future increase in the agricultural&#13;
production (and its value added) as a consequence of the rehabilitation of the rural roads. In&#13;
order to delimit those expectations, it has been assumed that any increase in the number of&#13;
cultivated hectares cannot be higher than 5 percent and that this increase will take place one year&#13;
after the completion of the rehabilitation works. This assumption is also kept for increases in&#13;
livestock or milk production. Similarly, the analysis has also delimited the possible reduction in&#13;
production costs, assuming that these costs would be reduced, a year after the completion of the&#13;
works, by 5 percent as a consequence of the reduction in the costs of the inputs for that&#13;
production (in turn, as a consequence of the reduction in the transport costs of those inputs).&#13;
Increases in agricultural yields cannot be higher than 10 percent, reflecting the impact not only of&#13;
lower input costs but also of improved difusion of technology. Finally, it is assumed that farm&#13;
gate prices remain the same, before and after the rehabilitation works (conservative assumption&#13;
that considers a rather competitive market for the commercialization of the pertinent agricultural&#13;
and livestock products). These values are in line with similar projects in other developing&#13;
2&#13;
countries.&#13;
40.    Table 1 summarizes the results of the economic evaluation of 25 of the pilot sub-projects,&#13;
with an estimated cost of US$13.4 million. The results show a net present value of almost US$25&#13;
mnillion and a combined economic internal rate of return (EIRR)--prorated with the costs of the&#13;
projects--of 44 percent. Five sub-projects--out of the 25--would yield EIRRs that fall below the&#13;
10% benchmark. These projects would have required a closer look at their rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance costs and the production possibilities, including the incorporation of other&#13;
agricultural products that have not been part of the simplified procedure. The EIRRs for these&#13;
projects between 7.1 percent and 9.5 percent are sufficiently close to the 10% benchmark to&#13;
conclude that the refined analysis would have made the projects eligible under the procedures of&#13;
the economic evaluation.&#13;
41.    Table 2 summarizes a series of indicators for each of the above-mentioned pilot sub-&#13;
projects. The table shows that, in general, those sub-projects with a smaller number of&#13;
beneficiaries and a higher cost per beneficiary yield the lowest EIRRs. The table also shows a&#13;
2 One of the most comprehensive studies on the impact of rural infrastructure on economic and social benefits is summarized in&#13;
the October 1990 report of the International Food Policy Research Institute titled Developmental Impact of Rural&#13;
Infrastructure in Bangladesh, by R. Ahmed and M. Hossain. The report indicates that improvement in infrastructural&#13;
endowment (measured by distances to social services, market centers, and means of travel, and the transport cost per mile)&#13;
can increase household income by 33 percent, with the landless and small farmers garnering the larger share of the&#13;
increases from agricultural crops, wages, and livestock. In addition the study shows that infrastructure development has a&#13;
positive effect on health (with 77% of males and 77% of females in good health in infrastructural developed villages and&#13;
63% and 58% respectively, in underdeveloped villages).&#13;
Previous World Bank rural road projects further confirm the positive benefits of rural road rehabilitation as a&#13;
consequence of improved access to services. In the 1991 Ghana National Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance&#13;
project, based on a cross-sectional study of 2,700 households, it is documented that improved accessibility brought about&#13;
an average 20% increase in agricultural production. This report highlights a list of unquantifiable benefits, including&#13;
improved access to extension and other social services, and increased rural employment, specially for women. The impact&#13;
on the living standards of women is another benefit-particularly in terms of reducing the time consumed in transport-&#13;
also emphasized by recent literature on the impact of rural roads (see, for instance, Bryceson and Howe, 1993, "Rural&#13;
Household Transport in Africa: Reducing the Burden on Women," World Development, Vol. 21 No. 11). A more recent&#13;
World Bank appraisal report, the 1994 Mexico Second Decentralization and Regional Development Project, an&#13;
economically-feasible road rehabilitation program was established with an average cost of US$27 per inhabitant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157-&#13;
certain uniformity in the estimated rehabilitation costs per kilometer as well as the reported&#13;
transport costs per ton-kilometer. The number of cultivated hectares per beneficiary shows a&#13;
wider variation. However, this indicator reflects the distinct composition of the agricultural&#13;
economies of different departments or provinces.&#13;

economic Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return for the pilot sub-projects would&#13;
be reduced to US$23 million and 38 percent, respectively. The combined NPV would remain&#13;
positive even if production increases by 3.9 percent (one year after the completion of the works)&#13;
and no improvements take place in agricultural yields and no reductions in production costs.&#13;
Similarly, the NPV would remain positive if there are no increases in production and no reduction&#13;
in production costs and agricultural yields increase by at least 6.2 percent. Finally, the combined&#13;
NPV would remain positive if production costs decrease by 12.5 percent with no improvements in&#13;
production volumes or agricultural yields. In sum, these sensitivity analyses demostrate the&#13;
robustness of the economic worth of the pilot sub-projects.&#13;

ANNEX 12&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Pilot and 1996 Programs&#13;
Pilot&#13;
1.    Background. In view of the large scale of the Rural Roads Rehabilitation and&#13;
Maintenance RRRMP project, and the history of inactivity in the rural road sector, Government&#13;
decided to undertake a pilot prior to implementing the project. The pilot encompasses about&#13;
1,485 km of road rehabilitation and 21 km of paving of village streets in 19 provinces in the six&#13;
Departments of Peruz ranking highest in terms of poverty (Ancash, Apurimac, Ayacucho,&#13;
Cajamarca, Cusco, Huancavelica). The pilot would be financed retroactively by the proposed&#13;
loan. Local consultants were engaged to produce project designs, and certain of the projects had,&#13;
at the time of the Bank appraisal mission in May 1995, gone out to contract bidding with some&#13;
works underway in the Department of Cusco. Subsequently works began in July 1995. Full&#13;
details of location, length and costs of the pilot sub-projects are given in Attachment 1.&#13;
2.     Objectives and Findings of the pilot. The main objective of the pilot is to establish the&#13;
technical, administrative, socio-economic and cost information necessary to design the project.&#13;
The specific objectives of the pilot are given in Box below.&#13;
Objectives of the pilot&#13;
Obtain information and generate experience about:&#13;
* the availability and capacity of local consultants (who reside in the project areas) to undertake the studies;&#13;
adequacy of the terms of reference and the costs, quality and consistency of the studies;&#13;
*  the nature of the works recommended, including their costs, duration and scheduling;&#13;
*  the capacity of the local contractors (who reside in the project areas) to undertake the works;&#13;
&#149; the socio-econoniic parameters in the project areas and the means of obtaining them;&#13;
*  recommended methods for the execution of the works, including specific proposals for the use of labor-&#13;
intensive methodologies;&#13;
* the distribution of the needs and works amnong certain road networks in order to adequately dimension the&#13;
program.&#13;
3.     Though implementation of the pilot is still underway, the experience gained to date has&#13;
confirmed the validity of the assumptions and data used for project design: i) the local consultants&#13;
(who reside in the project areas) demonstrated capacity to produce suitable designs in a timely&#13;
manner, including adequate economic and technical assessments. Feedback from the initial&#13;
reviews allowed improvement of the terms of reference for the studies; ii) the solutions proposed&#13;
have been consistent with the type of road encountered, as a function of its traffic characteristics&#13;
and the population served. Consultants' costs are on average about US$10,000 per km (net of&#13;
taxes). This figure has been used for financial planning of the project in spite of the fact that so&#13;
far contractors bids are 10 to 20 percent less than the consultants determined values. Given that&#13;
contractors have been inactive in this sector for a long period of time, it has been decided that is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 162 -&#13;
prudent to retain this more conservative value. This figure will be reviewed based on&#13;
implementation experience; iii) the small local contractors have sufficient capacity to undertake&#13;
the works under contracts in the range of US$200,000 - US$250,000. They were able to produce&#13;
bids, and where construction has already begun, to undertake the works in an efficient manner.&#13;
One of the aims of the project is the development of the local construction industry and there are&#13;
indications that the project would address this objective; iv) the socio-economic criteria proposed&#13;
for the project were found to be workable and the data readily accessible by consultants for their&#13;
designs. Selection of sub-projects is based on poverty criteria and where the cost of the sub-&#13;
project exceeds a certain level, the method of analysis has been expanded to include other&#13;
indicators of economic viability; v) the objective of using of labor-based methods is being met in&#13;
terms of the cost percentage given to manual labor in the road rehabilitation component. PERT-&#13;
PCR will monitor this aspect more closely on the paving of village streets and plazas component&#13;
to see that local material as well as local labor is being used to the greatest extent possible; vi) the&#13;
targets proposed for the rehabilitation of primary and secondary roads were revised to take into&#13;
account DGC's current accomplishments in rehabilitating those networks. The experience has&#13;
highlighted the need for continuous coordination in the field.&#13;
4.    In general the findings from the pilot to date are positive and where necessary&#13;
improvements have been incorporated. The incremental nature of the project and the large&#13;
number of sub-projects allows for changes and updates to be readily incorporated. The findings&#13;
from the pilot are more fully discussed in the following sections.&#13;
5.    Reviews of the pilot. Bank missions have reviewed the pilot to highlight any problems&#13;
and update the pilot timely for improvement of the project. The implementing agency, PERT-&#13;
PCR, is monitoring the progress of the pilot and incorporating changes where applicable.&#13;
Reviews have been made of two aspects of the pilot sub-projects studies. i) review of consultants&#13;
reports - November 1994 preappraisal mission; and ii) review of contract documents- June 1995&#13;
appraisal mission. The first one covers the design studies carried out by the local consultants and&#13;
includes a review of the socio-economic indicators, the second one covers the actual contract bids&#13;
received from the local contractors and is more focused on the cost aspects including the&#13;
percentage use of manual labor.&#13;
6.    General criteria. The following criteria are assigned to the pilot: i) the pilot is to be&#13;
implemented in the regions of highest poverty; ii) the works under the pilot are to: 1) be simple&#13;
and be limited to those works necessary to reestablish the trafficability of the road without&#13;
necessitating changes in the geometry; 2) be implemented using labor based methods LBM; iii)&#13;
the works are to be orientated towards prioritizing resolving drainage problems in order to&#13;
facilitate later maintenance.&#13;
7.    Poverty criteria. Various poverty indicators, including the Infant Mortality Rate and&#13;
Index of Basic Needs Unsatisfied, were reviewed. The poverty indicator adopted for the selection&#13;
of the six Departments for the pilot was the percentage of Chronic Malnutrition for 1993. (This is&#13;
based on Census information for 1993 from the Ministry of Education and is based on a census of&#13;
children from 6- 10 years of age). Attachment 2 gives the ranking by Department. The average&#13;
percentage for the six Departments is 70%. While Amazonas ranks third, there are not many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 163 -&#13;
roads in this Department. The selection of the 19 provinces for the pilot, out of a possible 71&#13;
within these six Departments, includes criteria of logistic capacity and the disposition of the local&#13;
communities to participate in the project.&#13;
8.     Selection criteria. Those roads which necessitated urgent rehabilitation and which were&#13;
not included in the plans of MTC-DGC have been selected for the pilot. Having selected the&#13;
road, adjacent roads were included in order to form a "road tree" to improve substantially the&#13;
trafficability on a network basis in the region. Also included were those departmental roads or&#13;
national roads connecting the "road tree" with the most important centers of consumption in the&#13;
region which were found to be in poor condition. Of the 1,485 km of rural roads selected for the&#13;
Pilot, approximately 94% are classified as local (vecina!) roads and 6% classified as departmental&#13;
or national roads. (DGC has been rehabilitating "connecting" departmental roads in the selected&#13;
areas) The roads were selected on the basis of departmental road maps of MTC and other&#13;
information received about their condition and trafficability, after consultation with local&#13;
authorities&#13;
9.     Geographic location. The projects are located in the rural sierra, at altitudes reaching&#13;
2000m with rainfall of 1500mm in areas of difficult terrain and prone to landslides. The ambient&#13;
weather conditions and the nature of the local terrain are the main causes of road deterioration in&#13;
these areas.&#13;
10.    Selected consultants. One university and 21 local consultants were engaged to collect&#13;
socio-economic data and prepare the engineering designs for the roads. The consultants were&#13;
required to produce a preliminary report in 40 days and a final report within 60 days.&#13;
11.    Finding from the Pilot. The following sections outline the findings from the pilot and&#13;
actions that have been taken or will be taken by PERT-PCR for the fi.rther development of the&#13;
project.&#13;
12.    Planning and administrative aspects. The findings from the pilot and the subsequent&#13;
actions to be/ undertaken by PERT-PCR are set out in the table below.&#13;

execution of works.&#13;
13.    Technical and cost aspects. On the basis of recommendations given on previous Bank&#13;
missions in the preparation of the project and the socio-economic information collected, the local&#13;
consultants designed solutions applicable to the type of road encountered, as a function of its&#13;
traffic characteristics and the population served. For the roads of lesser importance the proposals&#13;
aimed at re-establishing the drainage system and the trafficability of the roadway, and for the&#13;
roads of greater importance the proposals aimed at also improving the serviciability of the road&#13;
surfaces. The solutions proposed under the Pilot varied from those roads which only needed&#13;
deferred maintenance, to those which needed investment typical for rehabilitation and&#13;
emergencies, to those requiring major investments to correct or limit landslides. The findings&#13;
from the Pilot and the subsequent actions to be undertaken by PERT-PCR are set out in the table&#13;
below.&#13;

ANNEX 13&#13;
PERU&#13;
RURAL ROADS REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
Joint Bank-IDB Supervision Plan&#13;
1.    Building on the experience gained during project preparation, IDB and the Bank will&#13;
supervise the project through a shared project team. The respective task managers will&#13;
coordinate the timing and composition of field missions. Their frequency will be guided by the&#13;
progress and special requirements of project implementation. The missions are expected to&#13;
supervise the project twice a year. However, the supervision plan calls for a greater involvement&#13;
of the Resident Missions. The field offices will play an active role in (1) reviewing subproject&#13;
eligibility and procurement. (2) monitoring the monthly update of the project information system,&#13;
(3) visiting work sites and municipalities involved in the technical assistance program, and (4)&#13;
providing follow-up and problem-resolution support.&#13;
2.    The attached table shows the supervision plan prepared taking into account the&#13;
Implementation Schedule agreed for the execution of the project (Annex 3) and the need to keep&#13;
the project in phase with the Government's budget cycle. The core project team would consist&#13;
of: the two task managers (one from each bank), a transport economist and a highway engineer,&#13;
all stationed in Washington, and institutional development specialist and a highway engineer&#13;
stationed in Peru (Resident Missions). This core team would be supported by key specialists in&#13;
the areas of environment, rural development/participatory assessment and non-motorized rural&#13;
transport. Overall, it is estimated that the supervision effort will entail about 154 staff-weeks for&#13;
the duration of the project, with the Bank's share estimated at about 77 staff weeks (out of which&#13;
30 staff-weeks or 38 percent correspond to staff stationed in the Bank's Resident Mission in Peru&#13;
or local consultants). This would result on an average of 20 to 23 staff-weeks for Bank&#13;
supervision during the first three years of project implementation, an estimate that reflects&#13;
synergies expected from sharing project supervision with IDB and delegating responsibilities to&#13;
the Resident Mission.&#13;
3.    Annual Reviews. At yearly intervals, starting not later than six months after loan&#13;
effectiveness, the Bank, IDB and the Government will conduct a formal joint review of the&#13;
progress made in reaching the project objectives and in implementing the project components.&#13;
Participants will include key representatives from the operating UEDs, pertinent consultants and&#13;
NGOs involved in the technical assistance component, MTC, MEF, decentralized agencies&#13;
involved in rural development programs, and of a sample of beneficiaries.&#13;
4.    The annual reviews will provide an opportunity to assess (1) progress in physical project&#13;
implementation, (2) the performance of PERT-PCR and each of its UEDs, (3) the effectiveness of&#13;
the work programs in terms of community and local government involvement, local contractors&#13;
response, coordination with other development programs, and achievement of project objectives,&#13;
(4) progress in implementing the institutional development components, (5) the adequacy of the&#13;
procedures stated in the Project Operational Manual, (6) progress in restructuring and&#13;

strengthening road maintenance administration and finance, and (7) the justification of the&#13;
investment and institutional proposals submitted by each UEDs for implementation during the&#13;
subsequent year. The project implementation schedule and monitoring indicators will be updated&#13;
during the annual review. PERT-PCR would furnish to IDB and the Bank at least two weeks&#13;
before departure of the annual review mission, a "review report" containing the agenda for the&#13;
meeting, the current status with regard to the topics listed above and the annual plan proposed for&#13;
the prospective year. The format and content of these reviews would be agreed upon at&#13;
negotiations. Agreement should be reached at negotiations that MTC and the Government will&#13;
conduct annual project reviews with IDB and the Bank to cover the above mentioned topics, and&#13;
that in the event of unsatisfactory progress, Government will prepare remedial action plans&#13;
satisfactory to IDB and the Bank within two months of the review.&#13;
5.    Program Mid-term Review. The third annual review will constitute a Mid-Term Review&#13;
of the program and provide an opportunity for a more comprehensive assessment of the&#13;
achievements of the project to date, and of the prospects for continuing with a follow-up&#13;
operation. Prior to this review, PERT-PCR will conduct a performance survey in a sample of&#13;
provinces participating in the project to assess the progress in achieving the objectives of the&#13;
project, as defined by the set of agreed indicators. In addition to covering the topics listed above,&#13;
this review will examine the progress made by Government with regard to (1) its agenda for&#13;
administrative decentralization and the need to adjust the operational set up of the project&#13;
accordingly, (2) the establishment of a strategy for rural roads funding, (3) the improvement of&#13;
inter-agency coordination, and (4) the participation of municipalities in project activities, including&#13;
the possibility that certain municipalities became direct executing agencies under PERT-PCR.&#13;
The review will consider proposals for restructuring or reorienting the program, taking account of&#13;
all relevant sector and program issues. At this stage, Government, IDB and the Bank will discuss&#13;
specific arrangements for financing the second phase of the program, including decisions on the&#13;
need to start preparation of the follow-on loans to support its execution, the amount of financing&#13;
required, the need to extend the program to cover more departments than the 12 presently&#13;
selected and other adjustments deemed necessary to enhance the development impact of the&#13;
program. Subject to actual performance in project implementation, the comprehensive nature of&#13;
this review would provide sufficient information to appraise the follow-up project in order to&#13;
complete the second phase of the program.&#13;

            Peru - Rural Road Rehabilitation and
            Maintenance Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall purpose of the Rural Road
            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project is to provide a
            well-integrated and reliable rural road system through
            rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads and key links
            connecting to the primary road system. This will help
            alleviate rural poverty and raise living standards of rural
            communities through increased access to basic social and
            economic and income-generating activities. The specific
            objectives are to: 1) reduce transport costs and raise the
            reliability of vehicular access to expand markets for
            agricultural and non-farm products; 2) integrate poorly
            accessible zones with regional economic centers; 3) improve
            transport conditions in rural villages; 4) generate
            employment through the rehabilitation and maintenance of
            rural roads to mitigate rural poverty; and 5) build up
            institutional capacity at local government levels and
            develop small and medium enterprises to manage and carry
            out, on a sustainable basis, the maintenance and upgroading
            of rural roads. The project consists of the following six
            components: 1) rehabilitation of rural roads; 2)
            rehabilitation of connecting primary and secondary roads; 3)
            routine maintenance of rural roads; 4) improvement of
            village streets; 5) improvement of non-motorized rural
            transport; and 6) institutional development which includes:
            a) technical assistance to improve planning and management
            of rural roads; b) studies on local road management
            practices and rural road financing; c) technical assistance
            to develop micro-enterprises formed by groups of
            beneficiaries for road maintenance; and d) technical
            assistance and training services to strengthen the local
            road construction industry.
