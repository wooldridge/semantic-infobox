Summary and ConcluLsions&#13;
This paper asks if there is anything useful that economists can say&#13;
about minimizing the real costs of stabilization and the structural adjust-&#13;
ment entailed by reforming various inefficient microeconomic policies in the&#13;
economy.&#13;
Of particular concern are the effects of these policies on real wage&#13;
(and real profit) rates in the economy. In many developing countries where&#13;
the poor people's chief endowment is their labor, these changes in real wages&#13;
induced by alternative policy packages should capture the major effects on the&#13;
levels of living of the poor. The policy packages considered are components&#13;
of the deflationary fiscal and monetary package, changes in nominal exchange&#13;
rates, reduction of the foreign trade and other commodity price distortions,&#13;
and the reduction or removal of distortions in financial (capital) markets.&#13;
The paper first outlines a version of the orthodox trade theoretic&#13;
treatment of the small, open economy (the so-called Australian model of&#13;
balance of payments) which is sufficiently rich to think through the various&#13;
issues raised in debates over stabilization policies. This simple framework&#13;
is then applied to a "model" case to show how it can be used to answer questions&#13;
on how to minimize the welfare costs of tradlitional stabilization and adjust-&#13;
ment packages.&#13;
The third part of the paper briefly discusses the usual reasons why&#13;
countries get into a "crisis," and whether ithere is anything which can be&#13;
usefully said and done to prevent them from getting into fresh ones in the&#13;
future. The implications of some radical ideas recently outlined by Max Corden&#13;
on the question: "What is a 'balance of payments' problem?" are outlined.&#13;
The final part of the paper explains how the approach outlined in the first&#13;
two parts of the paper might be applied in practice in country economic&#13;
analysis by the Bank.&#13;

Resume et conclusions&#13;
Ce document pose la question de savoir si les economistes ont quelque&#13;
chose d'utile a dire sur la possibilite de minimiser les coats reels des&#13;
mesures de stabilisation A prendre et les ajustements structurels A operer&#13;
quand on veut modifier des politiques microeconomiques inefficaces.&#13;
On considere en particulier les effets de ces politiques sur les&#13;
salaires reels (et les b6nefices reels). Dans beaucoup de pays en deve-&#13;
loppement oa la principale ressource des pauvres est leur capacite de tra-&#13;
vail, les modifications de salaires reels provoquees par l'application&#13;
d'une nouvelle politique sont a considerer dans leurs principales inci-&#13;
dences sur le niveau de vie des pauvres. Les trains de mesures envisa-&#13;
g6es sont des volets d'une politique fiscale et monetaire deflationniste&#13;
modifications des taux de change nominaux, reduction des distorsions du&#13;
commerce exterieur et, d'une maniere generale, des prix des produits, et&#13;
reduction ou suppression des distorsions des marches financiers (de&#13;
capitaux).&#13;
On presente d'abord une version du traitement theoriquement appli-&#13;
cable, en bonne orthodoxie, A la petite economie ouverte (le modele "aus-&#13;
tralien" de balance des paiements), assez riche pour prendre en compte&#13;
tous les problemes qui alimentent le debat sur les politiques de stabili-&#13;
sation. On applique alors ce cadre simple A un cas "modele" pour montrer&#13;
que l'on peut ainsi savoir comment minimiser les incidences sociales des&#13;
mesures de stabilisation et d'ajustement.&#13;
La troisieme partie expose brievement les raisons habituelles qui&#13;
font qu'un pays entre en "crise", et pose la question de savoir s'il est&#13;
possible de dire ou faire quelque chose d'utile pour leur eviter d'en con-&#13;
naitre d'autres plus tard. On tire ensuite les consequences de quelques&#13;
id6es revolutionnaires recemment enoncees par Max Corden sur la question&#13;
"Qu'est-ce qu'un probleme de balance des paiements?"  La derniere partie&#13;
du document montre comment la Banque pourrait appliquer la methode d6finie&#13;
dans les deux premieres analyses economiques des pays.&#13;

Resumen y conclusiones&#13;
En el presente estudio se plantea la cuesti6n de si los economistas&#13;
pueden aportar alguna idea uitil para minimizar los costos reales de la&#13;
estabilizaci6n y el ajuste estructural que exige la reforma de las diver-&#13;
sas politicas microecon6micas ineficaces en las economias de los paises.&#13;
Se han sefialado con particular preocupaci6n los efectos que tales&#13;
politicas tierien en las tasas salariales (y de utilidades) reales. En&#13;
muchos paises en desarrollo, donde el principal activo de los grupos&#13;
pobres es su trabajo, las variaciones del salario real provocadas por los&#13;
diferentes conjuntos de medidas de estabilizaci6n y ajuste necesariamente&#13;
han de tener efectos importantes en los niveles de vida de esos grupos.&#13;
Los conjuntos de medidas examinados en el estudio son los componentes del&#13;
conjunto de politicas fiscales y monetarias deflacionarias, las variacio-&#13;
nes de los tipos de cambio nominales, la reducci6n del comercio exterior y&#13;
otras distorsiones de los precios de los productos basicos, y la reducci6n&#13;
o eliminaci6n de las distorsiones en los mercados financieros (de capital).&#13;
Se esboza primero en el estudio una versi6n del tratamiento te6rico&#13;
ortodoxo del comercio en una economia pequefia y abierta (el llamado modelo&#13;
australiano de balanza de pagos), que es suficientemente amplio para per-&#13;
mitir un analisis de las diversas cuestiones que se plantean en los deba-&#13;
tes sobre las politicas de estabilizaci6n. Este marco sencillo se aplica&#13;
luego a un caso "modelo" para mostrar la forma en que se puede usar para&#13;
responder al interrogante de c6mo minimizar los costos en terminos de&#13;
bienestar social que suponen las medidas tradicionales de estabilizaci6n y&#13;
ajuste.&#13;
En la tercera parte del estudio se examinan brevemente las razones&#13;
usuales por las que los paises experimentan "crisis" y las soluciones o&#13;
medios que podrian proponerse o usarse para evitar que vuelvan a experi-&#13;
m,entarlas en el futuro. Asimismo, se esbozan algunas ideas radicales&#13;
expuestas recientemente por Max Corden con el planteamiento de la pregunta&#13;
"que es un 'problema de balanza de pagos'?". En la parte final se&#13;
explica c6mo podria el Banco aplicar en la practica, en los estudios&#13;
econ6micos de los paises, el metodo resefiado en las dos primeras partes.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
There has been a great deal of concern recently about the effects of&#13;
various IMF stabilization and World Bank structural adjustment programmes on&#13;
the real economy, in particular on the incomes of the poorer sections in&#13;
developing countries. (See Dell (1981), Williamson (ed) (1983), Killick (ed.)&#13;
(1982), Nowzad (1981)). However, much of the discussion consists of (a)&#13;
identifying whether the 'crises' which give rise to these programmes are&#13;
caused by exogenous or endogenous factors, and (b) deriving rules for when the&#13;
ensuing payments deficits should be financed through foreign capital inflows&#13;
or through domestic real adjustment.&#13;
The impetus for these concerns are the problems developing countries&#13;
are supposedly facing because of the oil price rise of the '70s, or else a&#13;
worsening in the current external environment for their exports. Furthermore,&#13;
there is the growing recognition in many LDC's that many of their past trade,&#13;
exchange rate, and pricing policies have been inimical for their development&#13;
and a removal of these policy induced distortions is therefore sought. As the&#13;
long run 'solution' to all these perceived problems requires some reallocation&#13;
of resources, and a fresh deployment of available policy instruments, these&#13;
general worries can be considered to encompass the following general&#13;
questions: (i) What are likely to be the reallocations of domestic production&#13;
and consumption that are likely to arise during the process of adjustment?&#13;
(ii) What are the likely changes in the levels of living of the poorer&#13;
sections during this process? (iii) Are there policies, including their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
correct sequencing which can be used to minimize the efficiency and equity&#13;
costs of the transition?&#13;
In answering these questions, a bewildering array of very different&#13;
theoretical frameworks are available and have been applied to various&#13;
countries.l/ Surprisingly, in applied work the orthodox trade theoretic&#13;
framework using a model of the small dependent economy (the so called&#13;
Australian model of balance of payments theory) has been rarely used to answer&#13;
these questions. Many of the seeming diverse theoretical frameworks being&#13;
applied to analyze the effects of stabilization policies turn out to be&#13;
special cases of this more orthodox model.   The assumptions leading to these&#13;
"queer cases" from the viewpoint of the traditional theory, usually concern&#13;
odd assumptions about 'substitutability' in production or consumption. 2/&#13;
Cline (in Williamson (ed) (1983)) has recently provided a compendium of these&#13;
strange assumptions, and the evidence against them.3/&#13;
1/    For a sample see Cline &amp; Weintraub (ed.).&#13;
2/    Thus some monetarist models assume the 'law of one price' so that there&#13;
is perfect substitutability between trade and non-traded goods. No role&#13;
is left :Ln these models for the determinants and effects of changes in&#13;
the real exchange rate, i.e., the relative price of traded to non-traded&#13;
goods, which is central to the workings of the orthodox model. By&#13;
contrast, many of the so-called 'Keynensian' models assume no or little&#13;
substitutability in production and consumption so that relative prices&#13;
play little part in their stories, which are dominated by changes in the&#13;
level of income.&#13;
3/    Also see J. Hanson (1982) for a critique of the models of the&#13;
'contractionary' effects of devaluations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
It may be useful, therefore, to set out a version of the orthodox&#13;
framework, (not to be found in any one place), which is sufficiently rich to&#13;
think through the various issues raised iri the current 'stabilization'&#13;
debate.  The next part of this paper outlines this simple framework.  The&#13;
second part applies it to a 'modei' case to show how it can be used in applied&#13;
work, to answer the questions concerning the weltare cost minimising&#13;
deployment of policies in the traditiona'l stabilization and adjustment&#13;
packages.&#13;
Before we begin, however, it mar be useful to make some obvious&#13;
points which tend to get ignored in the usual discussion of these issues and&#13;
to pinpoint the nature of 'the problem.'&#13;
The typical stabilization cir, adjustment programme is launched when a&#13;
country is in a 'crisis'. This is usually an lncipient or actual balance of&#13;
payments crisis.  Elementary considerations suggest that the crisis arises&#13;
because the payments deficit is unsustainable, that is, it cannot be financed,&#13;
and that in an immediate sense it entails an excess of domestic expenditure&#13;
over domestic output, or that the current ievei of income being enjoyed by a&#13;
country's inhabitarnts cannot be sustairned. In that sense, any immediate cure&#13;
for the 'crisis' must necessarily involve reducLng the level of current&#13;
expenditure.  It may be possible, if the projper policy medicine is taken, that&#13;
the country may then be able to get some foreign resource inflows which could&#13;
allow it to make this reduction in reaL expenditure gradual rather than&#13;
sudden.&#13;
With any rate of social tin,,e preference which is greater than the&#13;
cost of the foreign borrowing, the gradual path must dominate the sudden shock&#13;
treatment, if the former is feasible.  But, :t is this very feasibility which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
is usually in question, essentially on grounds of the likely behavioral&#13;
patterns of particular governments. A long drawn out cut in real&#13;
expenditures, may be politically more disastrous for a government than a&#13;
quick, once for all, cut in real expenditure. This is a question of&#13;
judgement, mainly of a political nature on which economists can hardly claim&#13;
any expertise.&#13;
This leads to the second string of the usual 'easing of the pain'&#13;
type of arguments for gradualism in reducing real expenditures. It is argued&#13;
that, over time, particularly if various policy reforms are undertaken to&#13;
improve the overall efficiency of the economy, the future growth of real&#13;
income and output (from the ongoing processes of growth, as well as those&#13;
increments induced by the improved policies) might not require any real cut in&#13;
expenditures at all. Again in terms of economic theory, this would be&#13;
uncontroversial. The controversy arises because of differing judgements about&#13;
the tenacity and political will of governments to follow through such a phased&#13;
programme of policy reform, when the pain experienced by various sectional&#13;
groups hurt by the removal of various 'distortions' from which they had&#13;
benefitted, is more immediate (and more vocally expressed) than the promised&#13;
joys which the greater efficiency will bring in the future.&#13;
As such I take a completely agnostic position on the question of&#13;
whether, in general, it is better to administer shock therapy to the patient&#13;
in trouble, or to allow his immediate and unbearable pain to be turned into a&#13;
medium term headache! I will instead assume in what follows that the patient&#13;
has been given the usual IMF medicine in terms of reducing absorption&#13;
(reducing domestic expenditure relative to output), and ask is there anything&#13;
useful that economists can say about minimizing the real costs of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- j -&#13;
stabilization and the structural adjustment entailed by reforming various&#13;
inefficient microeconomic policies in the economy?&#13;
The real effects we shall be particularly concerned with are the&#13;
effects on the real wage (and real profit rate) in the economy, which, in many&#13;
developing countries where the poor's chief endowment is their labour, should&#13;
capture the major effects on the levels of living of the poor, through the&#13;
changes in real wages induced by alternative policy packages.&#13;
The instruments we consider are the components of the deflationary&#13;
fiscal and monetary package, changes in nominal exchange rates, reduction of&#13;
the foreign trade and other commodity price distortions, and the reduction or&#13;
removal of distortions in financial (capital) markets.&#13;
In the third part of the paper we briefly discuss the usual reasons&#13;
why countries get into a 'crisis', and whether there is anything which can be&#13;
usefully said and done to prevent them from getting into fresh ones in the&#13;
future. In this context we outline the implications for our subject of some&#13;
radical ideas recently outlined by Max Corden on the question: "What is a&#13;
'balance of payments' problem?"&#13;
The final part of the paper outlines how the approach outlined in the&#13;
first two parts of the paper might be applied in practice.&#13;
I. A SIMPLE FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSING VARIOUS&#13;
REAL ASPECTS OF STABILISATION POLICIES&#13;
There are two essential components of the framework: (1) a simple&#13;
two-good, three-factor trade-theoretic model, and (2) a simple model of the&#13;
domestic banking system. These real and monetary models are spelt out in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
fairly simple terms in the next two sections of this part. 1/ The next part&#13;
puts them together to analyse the real effects on real wages and output in&#13;
various stabilisation packages in different structural environments, and&#13;
outlines any distortions flowing directly from the adjustment processes which&#13;
may need to be corrected by alternative policy instruments. It also suggests&#13;
some welfare-theoretic considerations which might enable a welfare cost&#13;
minimising sequence of reforms in the standard stabilisation cum adjustment&#13;
package.&#13;
1. *  The Real Economy&#13;
Consider a small open economy, which faces given terms of trade for&#13;
its exportables and importables, which can therefore be aggregated into a&#13;
Hicksian composite good labelled 'tradeables'. Besides these, there is a&#13;
single non-traded good. Both tradeables and non-tradeables are final consumer&#13;
goods, and as intermediate inputs are also combined with capital and labour to&#13;
produce the domestic outputs of the good. Capital throughout is assumed to be&#13;
sector-specific in the short run, but through depreciation and new investment&#13;
can be 'shifted' from one of the 'sectors' to the other, over time. Labour&#13;
force and capital growth are, throughout, assunmed to be exogenous.&#13;
The economy has distortions irn the foreign trade sector, and in both&#13;
its capital and labour market. The trade distortions could be due to the&#13;
1/    The real models are based on Jones (1971), Mussa (1974), Burgess&#13;
(1980)and Neary(1982)(1978), the monetary models on McKinnon (1981),&#13;
McKinnon and Mathieson (1981), Dornbusch (1974)(1980), Krueger (1974),&#13;
and the integration of the real and monetary aspects in Corden (1977),&#13;
and Corden and Jones (1976). Whilst Lal (1983) provides an algebraic&#13;
formulation, and an application to the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
presence of either import tariffs, quantitative import controls and/or export&#13;
subsidies. The capital market distortion is due to the provision of explicit,&#13;
or implicit, interest rate subsidies through the banking system to, we assume,&#13;
the traded good sector. The labour markiet is distorted because the wage paid&#13;
by the traded good sector is above its social opportunity cost, and, hence,&#13;
higher than that in the production of non-tradeables, either because of "dual&#13;
economy" type reasons or because of labour market segmentation. We shall&#13;
assume that this particular wage distortion is not alterable, and represents a&#13;
constant fixed markup on the traded good money wage over that in non-traded&#13;
good production. This enables us to ignore it in what follows, and to work&#13;
with an "as if" uniform wage in both sectors. If the wage distortion can be&#13;
removed, its analysis on the real side is exactly the same as with the capital&#13;
market distortion--see below.&#13;
The economy is initially in an equilibrium (which is distorted), in&#13;
Figure 1 , where Panels I and II represent labour value added marginal&#13;
products (VAMPL) schedules in the two industries (panel 1), and the iso price&#13;
(or unit cost) curves for the given distorted product prices in panel 2. 1/&#13;
_LThese curves are given by:&#13;
a&#149;w + akt r    pt                 where Pi is all the commodity&#13;
lt   t   t            prices of the traded (t) and non-traded&#13;
(n) goods, and where the ai. are the&#13;
a  w + akr    P                   factor inputs of labour  (Z3  and&#13;
1=  kn n    n         capital (k) pe  unit of output, w &amp; r are&#13;
the wage and rental rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
As drawn, we have assumed that the non-traded good industry is labour&#13;
intensive relative to the traded one. Its unit cost curve, therefore, is less&#13;
steep at every wage-rental ratio than that for traded goods. We also make the&#13;
so-called "strong factor-intensity" assumption which entails that the two cost&#13;
curves only intersect once.&#13;
(A)   With given stocks of capital and labour, given money prices of traded&#13;
and non-traded goods, the initial equilibrium of the economy is given by&#13;
points a in panel 1, and b &amp; c in panel 2. The subsidy to capital in the&#13;
tradeable good industry means that its net of subsidy rental rate (rot) is&#13;
less than the rental rate (ron) in the non-traded good sector, but, b &amp; c are&#13;
equilibrium points as the subsidy inclusive rental in the traded good sector&#13;
is = r., &#13;
(1) Removing the Capital Market Distortion:   Suppose that the&#13;
government eliminates the explicit or implicit subsidy to capital.   This will&#13;
mean the private return to capital in the traded good sector will fall from&#13;
its subsidised level  (=ron)  to  rot,  and as a result, there will be a&#13;
tendency for on capital to be shifted from the traded to non-traded good&#13;
industries. The relative rise in the non-traded good sector's capital stock&#13;
will shift it mpl curve to the left; as will that of the traded good sector,&#13;
because of the fall in its capital stock. Equilibrium being achieved at&#13;
points d (panel a        aktrt = Pt almw + aknr  = P  (P) 1) and e (panel 2)&#13;
with a higher nominal wage, wl, and uniform rental, r, in both&#13;
industries. As, ex hypothesi, commodity prices have not changed, the real&#13;
wage will rise unambiguously and the real rental rate will fall.&#13;
(2) Removing or Reducing Product Market Distortions.&#13;
(a) With Wage Flexibility. Suppose that simultaneously or subsequentlv,&#13;
the distortion in product markets (the composite "tariff" on the tradeables commodity)&#13;
is either reduced or removed. The 'effective' relative price of traded to non-traded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
goods  (PT/PN)' or as it is called, the "real exchange rate", now falls.  This&#13;
will have three effects. First, it will lead to a proportionate shift,&#13;
downwards, in labour's marginal value added product (mvapl) and the unit cost&#13;
curve in the traded good industry (if there are no inter industry flows).&#13;
Secondly, to the extent traded inputs are used in the production of traded&#13;
goods, the reduction in their price (from the reduction of the 'tariff') will&#13;
lead to an upward shift in the mvapl and unit cost schedules for tradeables.&#13;
The net effect, with intermediate inputs, will depend upon the extent to which&#13;
the "effective protection" of the traded good industry is reduced. If it is,&#13;
the LDT schedule in Figure 2 will shift downward. Thirdly, for the non-&#13;
traded good industry, the reduction in the price of tradeable intermediate&#13;
inputs will shift the unit cost curve and its vmpal schedule upwards. The&#13;
extent of these shifts will depend upon the "tradeable intensity" of&#13;
production in both the sectors, as well as the relative reduction in the price&#13;
of tradeables.&#13;
As drawn, the net effect is for the money wage to fall to W2, but&#13;
as the price of non-traded goods has stayed constant, and, that of traded&#13;
goods has fallen by more than the fall in the money wage, real wages will&#13;
rise. 1/ The rental rates in this initial short run equilibrium will be given&#13;
by r2T for tradeables and r2N for non-traded goods. This difference in&#13;
rental rates will lead to the 'shifting' of capital from the traded to non-&#13;
1/    This can be derived from equation (7) in Lal (1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
traded good sectors. In the process, the economy will move to the point i&#13;
(the intersection of the 'new' unit cost curves) in panel (2), and j in&#13;
panel 1. The capital labour ratio (given by the slope of the tangent to the&#13;
respective iso price curves) will be higher at i than at e , in both&#13;
industries; employment and output will be higher in the non-traded good&#13;
industry and, as relative commodity prices remain unchanged in the movement&#13;
from e to i in panel 2, real wages will be higher and real rental rates lower&#13;
in this 'long run' Samuelson-Stolper equilibrium for the economy. During this&#13;
process there will be a monotonic increase in national income as measured by&#13;
the new 'distortion free' relative prices of commodities. 1/&#13;
(b) With Sticky Wages&#13;
Suppose wages are sticky. This implies that (at each particular&#13;
date, till the long run equilibrium is reached) the labour market does not&#13;
clear before the capital market, as was assumed in the previous case. There&#13;
is disequilibrium in the short run in both factor markets. If with the fall&#13;
in the price of tradeables, the wage is sticky (say in terms of the price of&#13;
the non-traded goods), then in Figure 2, short term equilibrium will be at k &amp;&#13;
P in panel 1, and at m &amp; n in panel 2. There will be unemployment of labour&#13;
of Pk , and, as before, there will be a rental differential in favour of non-&#13;
traded goods, which will induce the shifting of capital. As the sticky money&#13;
wage w1 is combined, ex hypothesi, with a fall in the price of tradeables&#13;
(with the price of non-traded goods unchanged), the real wage will be higher&#13;
in this sticky money wage 'short run' equilibrium.&#13;
1/    See Neary (1982), Figure 3.6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
However, even if the unemployment does not exert downward pressure on&#13;
the money wage, then with the shifting of capital from the non-traded to&#13;
traded goods industries, and the subsequent: leftward shift of the two curves&#13;
in panel 1, money and real wages will rise above their sticky wage level, till&#13;
the long run equilibrium at i and j (as in the previous case) is&#13;
attained. 1/&#13;
1/    This is, of course, the result of our factor intensity assumptions.&#13;
Thus, if, for simplicity, there were no interindustry flows and&#13;
tradeables were labour intensive, then the long run equilibrium would&#13;
have entailed a lowering of the money and real wage. The initial sticky&#13;
wage would not have been validated in the process of adjustment with the&#13;
shifting of capital stocks. There would be unemployment until the new&#13;
long run equilibrium was reached. Moreover, during this transition the&#13;
path of national income (measured at ithe 'new' relative commodity&#13;
prices) need not be monotonic. It is possible that instead of&#13;
increasing monotonically, there may be periods of "falling real national&#13;
income." This is due to the fact that, with unemployment, the shadow&#13;
wage in this simple model becomes zero, and the shadow rentals of&#13;
capital in the two sectors are then g:Lven by the average product of&#13;
capital in the two industries. Private agents, however, will earn the&#13;
marginal product of capital (our 'rental' rates), as they still have to&#13;
pay the slowly adjusting sticky wage, even though there is&#13;
unemployment.  It is possible, therefore, that the relative shadow&#13;
rentals (= relative average product of capital) may not be the same as&#13;
the relative marginal products of capital, which are influencing the&#13;
private shifts of capital. There may thus be overshooting with the wage&#13;
falling below its long run equilibrium level, leading to capital being&#13;
shifted back to the traded good industry. If, however, private agents&#13;
perceive the long run equilibrium wage, or else in the transition the&#13;
government can provide a wage subsidy which equates the sticky money&#13;
wage to the 'equilibrium' money wage, this problem will not arise.&#13;
Given problems of information, however, it is unlikely that such a&#13;
second-best policy is likely to be feasible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(B)   The Effects of Changing Factor Supplies&#13;
These can be readily accommodated within the above scheme, as they&#13;
will lead, at given relative commodity prices, to the so-called Rybczynski&#13;
effects. With perfect factor mobility it is well known that, at constant&#13;
relative commodity prices, if there is a relative expansion in the supply of&#13;
labour the output of the labour intensive commodity rises more than&#13;
proportionately to the increase in labour supply and that of the capital&#13;
intensive commodity actually falls. This can be seen from Figure 3.&#13;
Initially equilibrium is at A &amp; B in panels I &amp; 2. The expansion of the&#13;
labour supply relative to capital shifts the mvpal in both the industries&#13;
downwards so that the new equilibrium in panel 1 is given by point c, and at&#13;
d &amp; e in panel 2. As commodity prices are unchanged (there is no shift in&#13;
the unit cost curves in panel 2) the real wage falls, and the rental rate&#13;
(both nominal and real) rises in both industries, but more in the labour&#13;
intensive non-traded good industry than in tradeables. This leads to a&#13;
shifting of capital from the tradeable to non-traded good industry and a&#13;
shifting leftwards of both the mvapl curves till the old wage-rental ratio&#13;
(wo,ro) is restored. But as (with the same capital stock) there is now at&#13;
f a larger proportion of a higher labour force in the production of non-&#13;
tradeables than tradeables, the output of non-tradeables expands whilst that&#13;
of tradeables contracts, as compared with the initial situation at A.&#13;
By this process, with wage flexibility real wages initially fall and&#13;
then rise back to their initial value.&#13;
2.    The Monetary Economy&#13;
We turn to the determinants of the new exchange rate, of nominal&#13;
aggregate expenditure and of the process of monetary expansion or contraction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
through fiscal and monetary policy. We do this in two steps. Initially we&#13;
assume that the money supply is exogenously determined, we then formulate how&#13;
it is endogenously determined. The exchange rate is assumed to be controlled&#13;
throughout this section by the 'authorities'.&#13;
(A)   Exogenous Money Supply&#13;
We now assume that the domestic demand for both tradeables and non-&#13;
tradeables (which are gross substitutes) depends upon the relative price&#13;
(PT/PN) of the two goods (that is, the real exchange rate) and the nominal&#13;
stock of money (M), as there is a constant money expenditure velocity (V, so&#13;
that money expenditure is equal to  VM).  The commodity balance conditions&#13;
imply that, whereas the domestic demand for non-tradeables must always equal&#13;
its supply, any excess demand (supply) for tradeables can be met by running a&#13;
trade deficit (surplus).&#13;
Given that the country is "small" in world trade and hence cannot&#13;
influence its terms of trade, any change in the domestic money price of&#13;
tradeables will depend upon changes in foreign currency prices and/or the&#13;
exchange rate. By contrast the relative price of non-traded goods will be&#13;
endogenously determined. The changes in real wages in turn will, for any&#13;
given level of factor market distortion and changes in relative factor&#13;
supplies, depend upon changes in the real exchange rate (the relative price&#13;
of PT/PN), as discussed in the previous section.&#13;
What are likely to be the movements in real wages (and real profits)&#13;
when there is an exogenous, ceteris paribus, change in (a) the money supply&#13;
and (b) in the exchange rate, assuming that there is short run fixity but long&#13;
run mobility of capital, but with (1) wage flexibility, and (2) with sticky&#13;
wages?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14&#13;
1.    Wage Flexibility&#13;
Figure 4 is the familiar Salter (1959) diagram of so-called&#13;
Australian balance of payments theory, where TN is the full employment&#13;
transformation curve of the two composite goods traded (T) and non-traded&#13;
(N).    Initial equilibrium is at  A  where a community indifference curve&#13;
representing the demands for the two goods is tangential to TN . The initial&#13;
real exchange rate (Pr/PN) is given by the slope of the line (1).&#13;
Now suppose that there is a devaluation or else, with a fixed nominal&#13;
exchange rate, the foreign currency price of the tradeable rises. 1/ With&#13;
initially no change in the price of non-traded goods, the real exchange rate&#13;
rises.  The short run equilibrium is now at point B in Figure 4 where TONO is&#13;
s s&#13;
the short run transformation function with sector-specific capital. At the&#13;
new real exchange rate 'consumption' will be at D, with excess demand for&#13;
N of CD matched by an excess supply of tradeables and a trade surplus of&#13;
BC. Ceteris paribus, given our factor intensity assumption that non-&#13;
tradeables are more labour intensive than tradeables, and if there are no&#13;
intermediate flows in production from Figure 5, the money wage will rise in&#13;
the short run with the rightward shift of the  CT and LT  curves, and the&#13;
money and real rentals on non-traded goods will fall and those on traded goods&#13;
will rise. As with the case of reducing the output price distortion in the&#13;
previous section, the movement in the short-run real wage is ambiguous. As&#13;
1/    The terms of trade, however, must remain constant or else the use of our&#13;
composite 'tradeable' would not be possible. In the 1970's a number of&#13;
primary product exporters found that on balance their terms of trade did&#13;
not change, but the foreign currency prices of both exports and imports&#13;
rose substantially.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
the money wage rises by less than the rise in the real exchange rate, the real&#13;
wage falls in terms of tradeables but rises in terms of nontraded goods (whose&#13;
prices, ex hypothesi, remain unchanged).&#13;
If there are intermediate goods, however, then depending upon the&#13;
relative tradeable intensity of production of the two goods, the money wage&#13;
could remain constant, or fall, leading to an unambiguous fall in real wages&#13;
in terms of both commodities.&#13;
If, however, adjustments in both the capital and labor market are&#13;
instantaneous, the economy will move directly to point E in Figure 4, and e&#13;
in Figure 5. The consumption point will be at F in Figure 4 and there will&#13;
be an even greater excess supply of tradeables (and hence a larger trade&#13;
surplus) and excess demand for non-tradeaLbles than with short-run specificity&#13;
of capital.  But now there will be an unambiguous fall in the real wage rate&#13;
and rise in the real wage rate (corresponding to this long run Stolper-&#13;
Samuelson equilibrium) as shown by point e in Figure 5.&#13;
However, the short-run position following the devaluation is not&#13;
sustainable for two reasons. First, the excess demand for the non-traded good&#13;
at points B &amp; D in Figure 4 will leadi to their money price rising, unless&#13;
these prices are rigid for some unassumed1 reasons. But if they are, then&#13;
demand and supply for nontraded goods carL only be maintained by running an&#13;
even larger trade surplus equal to BG, and reducing money expenditure till the&#13;
point G is attained on the income consumption curve for the new relative&#13;
prices given by line 2. Secondly, the balance of payments surplus will lead&#13;
to a rise of foreign exchange reserves. If these are monetised (on which more&#13;
below), then the domestic money supply will rise, pari passu, with the trade&#13;
surplus and this will also tend to increase the demand for non-traded goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
The real exchange rate will (in the absence of rigidity in non-traded good&#13;
prices) revert to its original level given by line (1) in Figure 4. All real&#13;
values will then revert to their original levels. The initial change in real&#13;
wages and real rentals will be reversed.&#13;
If, however, the change in the real exchange rate (from lines (1) to&#13;
(2) in Fig. 4, was initiated to deal with a shift in tastes, say, such that&#13;
the new long run equilibrium was given by point E, then the above real&#13;
exchange rate movement will not be reversed. The economy will move from point&#13;
A to B on the short run transformation curve. As this shifts along the&#13;
envelope of the long term curve the economy will travel (along the line of the&#13;
arrows) towards E, where at the full equilibrium, given our factor intensity&#13;
assumption, real wages will be lower and real rental rates higher.&#13;
Next consider the effects of a ceteris paribus monetary expansion,&#13;
starting off from the same internal equilibrium point A in Fig. 4. Assuming&#13;
that non-traded goods prices are flexible upwards, the monetary expansion will&#13;
raise monetary aggregate demand, and thence expenditure, leading to an excess&#13;
demand for both traded and non-traded goods. The former being met by running&#13;
the trade deficit, the latter by a rise in the price of the non-traded good&#13;
(the price of traded goods being fixed, ex hypothesi by the given foreign&#13;
currency price of tradeables and the exchange rate).&#13;
This rise in the price of non-traded goods (and in the real exchange&#13;
rate) using our previous diagram for the real economy will lead to a possible&#13;
rise in the short-run real wage if capital is sector-specific in the short-run&#13;
and a definite rise in the real wage in the 'long run', or if capital is&#13;
mobile.&#13;
But given the trade deficit, unless the country has access to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
unlimited foreign borrowing, it cannot be fEinanced indefinitely. Some&#13;
corrective action will need to be taken.  If the loss of foreign exchange&#13;
reserves flowing from the trade deficit is monetized, then the domestic money&#13;
supply will be contracting pari passu with the trade deficit. This will mean&#13;
that money expenditure will be reduced whic:h will in turn induce a fall in the&#13;
price of non-traded goods. This process will continue till the old&#13;
equilibrium point is reached.&#13;
Alternatively, if the government changes the real exchange rate&#13;
directly by devaluing at the start, then the devaluation will restore the&#13;
original position both because of the relative price change it entails as well&#13;
as because, by raising the price level (as the prices of traded goods rise) it&#13;
will lead to a contraction of real money balances. All real variables will be&#13;
back to their original levels, but during the transition real wages will be&#13;
higher and rental rates lower than they would otherwise have been.&#13;
2. Sticky Wages&#13;
With sticky wages and short run sector specificity of capital a&#13;
devaluation will raise the domestic money prices of traded commodities. As&#13;
money wages are rigid the economy will be at points A and f in Figure 6, with&#13;
an initially unchanged rental rate for N and a rise in the rental rate for&#13;
T. This will induce labor to move (at the fixed money wage) from N to T. But&#13;
with the same short run capital stock in N and a smaller amount of labor, the&#13;
capital-labor ratio will rise in N. With the given money wage the capital&#13;
stock in it can only be employed in the short run, if the price of N and thus&#13;
the rental on capital, falls so that the economy moves to point h in panel&#13;
(1) of Fig. 6, (and g, f in panel 2).   Figure 7 illustrates this case within&#13;
the Salter diagram. In the short run the economy will be at a point G to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
left of B (corresponding to the flexible wage case) on TO NO and the trade&#13;
S S&#13;
surplus will be even larger (as the fall in non-traded goods prices&#13;
accentuates the switching effects of the devaluation).&#13;
The real rental clearly falls in the non-traded good and rises in the&#13;
traded good sector. As the money wage is ex hypothesi, rigid in the short&#13;
run, the movement in the real wage is ambiguous, as it falls in terms of&#13;
traded goods whose price has risen with the devaluation and rises in terms of&#13;
non-traded goods whose price has fallen.&#13;
If, as before in Fig. 7, suppose the devaluation induced relative&#13;
price line is given by 2. With the shifts of capital from the non-traded to&#13;
traded good industry, the economy will move from G but to a point to the&#13;
right of E , that is, with a smaller rise in real exchange rate than was the&#13;
case with wage flexibility. This is because as capital is shifted out of the&#13;
non-traded good industry, its marginal product and hence its rental rate&#13;
will rise, and this will push up its price so that in Figure 6 the final&#13;
outcome will be at i in panel 1 and at f in panel 2, with the same money&#13;
wage, and higher prices of both commodities, real wages will be lower than in&#13;
the initial or intermediate positions, but the (new unified) rental rate will&#13;
be greater in both nominal and real terms.&#13;
All this has implicitly assumed that the government has been&#13;
passively validating the level of domestic expenditure required to keep the&#13;
non-traded good market in balance at each stage of the process, that is,&#13;
consumption is at points directly below G and E in Figure 7. Associated&#13;
with each of these points there will be a trade surplus which, if monetised,&#13;
for the reasons given earlier, will lead to an excess demand for N . This in&#13;
turn will put upward pressures on the price of N till the real exchange rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
and all other real variables revert to their original position.&#13;
This will not be the case if tastes have changed so that a new real&#13;
equilibrium at  E  is required and sustained in Figure 7.  In that case the&#13;
above real effects will remain.&#13;
(B)  The Financial and Fiscal System Introduced&#13;
So far we have assumed that changes in the money supply and exchange&#13;
rates are exogenously determined.   We neel to specify the mechanism through&#13;
which these changes are affected.   The simplest model of the financial and&#13;
fiscal system would consist of the interrelationships between a central bank,&#13;
commercial banks, and the government treasury. 1/ There are only two monetary&#13;
assets that can be held by the general non-bank public -- non-interest bearing&#13;
cash, and short term interest bearing deposits with commercial banks. The&#13;
commercial banks are subject to a variable reserve requirement by the central&#13;
bank such that they have to hold k percent of their term deposits as non-&#13;
interest bearing deposits with the central bank. The commercial banks make&#13;
loans to the non-bank sector at a regulatedi interest rate  iL  and cannot pay&#13;
more than iD' the regulated interest rate, to depositors for their time&#13;
deposits. Table 1 presents the balance sheets for the central commercial and&#13;
consolidated banking systems. From the latter we can derive the well-known&#13;
identities relating domestic credit (DC), money supply (M), and the two&#13;
1/    An unorganized financial sector coulcd be included a la McKinnon, and the&#13;
role of credit in financing firms working capital could be emphasized.&#13;
However, no great analytical insights are gained by including the&#13;
former, and the empirical importance of the effects on output for a&#13;
reduction in credit flowing from the latter do not seem to be great.&#13;
See Fry (1978), Cline (1982).&#13;

DC - total domestic credit which is made up of&#13;
L - loans by commercial banks to the non-bank public, and&#13;
Z - the covernment debt held by the central bank;&#13;
F - foreign exchange reserves;&#13;
M - money supply;&#13;
D - demand deposits: and&#13;
T - term deposits with the commercial banks.&#13;
High powered money (H) base is defined as&#13;

where C - currency, and the reserves held at the central bank against the&#13;
commercial banks demand deposits;&#13;
R - are the reserves held at the central bank against the&#13;
commercial banks time deposits.&#13;
If the commercial bank's 'cash ratio', which is the currency and&#13;
central bank reserves they hold against demand deposits, is Q , and the&#13;
reserve ratio against time deposits is k , there is a direct link between&#13;

If the proportion of the commercial banks' demand for time deposits&#13;
in the total money supply, which will depend upon the non-bank sector's&#13;
liquidity preferences and the deposit rate on time deposits, is given by  m&#13;
so that, D = mM, and T = (l-m)M, then we have the relationship between high-&#13;
powered money H and the money supply M as&#13;
M = b.H                                                (3.5)&#13;
where   b = 1/[Qm + (1-m)k]    is the money multiplier linking the high&#13;
powered money base to the economy's money supply.&#13;
Finally, we introduce the fiscal authorities, where the consolidated&#13;
budget (GB) of the public sector is represented by total government&#13;
expenditure G less taxes T or&#13;
GB = G - T                                              (3.6)&#13;
This budget deficit is financed either by (i) borrowing from the central bank&#13;
or through (ii) foreign borrowing, so that,&#13;
G - T =  AZ -  AFg                                     (3.7)&#13;
where   AFg is the change in foreign reserves due to government borrowing&#13;
abroad.&#13;
1. High Powered Money, Fiscal Deficits and Exchange Rates&#13;
The links between the domestic banking system, the fiscal system, and&#13;
the balance of payments, B , can now be readily derived.&#13;
Any change in the balance of payments   AB (assuming we start with&#13;
balance of payments equilibrium) will necessitate changes in the central&#13;
bank's foreign currency holdings A F so that we have the identity&#13;

Combining (3.1), (3.7) and (3.8), we get&#13;

E [AM - AL] + [T - G - AF9]                                 (3.9)&#13;
The first term on the right hand side shows the difference between changes in&#13;
the domestic money supply and in domestic credit to the non-bank public. The&#13;
second term gives the government's budget deficit that is not financed through&#13;
foreign borrowing, that is the change in total domestic credit due to the&#13;
budget deficits. This is the relationship which underlies the credit control&#13;
component of many stabilisation packages. With a balance of payments deficit,&#13;
and for any given level of government foreign borrowing, reducing domestic&#13;
credit creation used to finance both the government as well as the nonbank&#13;
public will, ceteris paribus, reduce the balance of payments deficit.&#13;
Obviously, the reduction of the government budget deficit entails&#13;
reducing government expenditure and/or raising its revenues. This will,&#13;
ceteris paribus, imply a decline (or smaller increase) in the amount of&#13;
government debt the central bank will be forced to hold.   This implies that&#13;
from (3.3) the two components of the high powered money base H (viewed from&#13;
the assets side of the central bank's balance sheets) will both be declining&#13;
(as, ex hypothesi, a balance of payments deficit will imply - AF ,   and the&#13;
reduced government deficit,- A Z). As a result, from (3.5) the domestic money&#13;
supply will be shrinking   [-AM - b - AH = b {-AF - AZ}].&#13;
Given the reserve requirements, from the commercial bank's balance sheets we&#13;
have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
DL - A [D + T - R - C]&#13;
A{M - [R+C) }&#13;
A{ M - (Qm + k(I-m)]M}&#13;
A{ N - (1/b)M}&#13;
(1-1/b)AM&#13;
The contraction in the non-bank public's domestic credit   AL  will be greater&#13;
than the contraction of the money supply induced by the balance of payments&#13;
deficit and from any reduction in the government's fiscal deficit, as the&#13;
value of the money multiplier b is greater than unity. The reduction in&#13;
high powered money, partly induced by th,e loss of foreign exchange reserves&#13;
and partly by the reduction of the government deficit, will reduce domestic&#13;
money expenditure and hence absorption.&#13;
Alternatively, suppose the government did not reduce its budget&#13;
deficit, but chose to reduce domestic credit extended to the non-bank public&#13;
directly through raising the reserve ratio, k , for commercial bank reserves&#13;
against their term deposits. This will again lead to a direct reduction in&#13;
the money supply and thence on monetary expenditure, in addition to that&#13;
flowing from the flow of foreign exchange reserves.&#13;
There are three potential avenues, therefore, within this schema for&#13;
affecting money expenditure and thereby domestic absorption. The first two&#13;
are through the direct reduction of the high powered money base; (a) the&#13;
automatic reduction flowing from any foreign reserve losses, (b) the policy&#13;
induced reduction of the government budgiet, and (c) the policy induced rise in&#13;
the reserve ratio.&#13;
But the automatic effect under (a) is also a policy variable, for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
automatic loss of foreign reserves with a balance of payments deficit which&#13;
leads to a direct reduction in H and thence in M only follows if the&#13;
nominal exchange rate is fixed. If the exchange rate is fully flexible, the&#13;
balance of payments deficit will lead to an automatic devaluation which will&#13;
bring the balance of payments into balance without any loss of foreign&#13;
reserves. In that case there would be no effect on domestic H, M and thence&#13;
on domestic absorption as a result of attempts to cure the balance of payments&#13;
deficit. The same effect could be achieved in a fixed exchange rate (or a&#13;
managed exchange rate) system if the effects of the foreign currency flows&#13;
induced by the balance of payments deficit were sterilised. This essentially&#13;
means, in terms of the available instruments (if there is no private market in&#13;
government debt), that the central bank would either have to raise the reserve&#13;
ratios for the commercial banks (so that the money multiplier would be lower)&#13;
or the treasury would have to lower the budget deficit by reducing the&#13;
government debt (Z) held by the central bank   (AZ = - ive).&#13;
The choice of the exchange rate regime (fixed versus floating), as&#13;
well as the government's ability to sterilise foreign exchange flows, are thus&#13;
important determinants of the degree of monetary independence the particular&#13;
country will have. Whilst irrespective of the exchange rate regime, there&#13;
will be an important policy choice in deciding whether the required dis-&#13;
absorption in the face of a trade imbalance and domestic price inflation is&#13;
brought about by a reduction in the government's budget deficit or changes in&#13;
the reserve ratios of the commercial banks (or some combination of the two).&#13;
2. The Real Effects of Disabsorption&#13;
The real effects of these methods of disabsorption can be categorised&#13;
as (1) those which only entail a shifting of the real exchange rate (the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 --&#13;
PT/PN) line in the Salter diagrams of the previous section, and hence do not&#13;
entail any relative price changes, other than those we have already discussed.&#13;
But, in addition, (2) there may be further relative price changes&#13;
induced by these alternative methods of disabsorption, which we next need to&#13;
consider. For simplicity, we assume a fixed or managed exchange rate&#13;
throughout what follows; though, as discussed in the next part, this should&#13;
not be taken to mean that a fixed (or discretionary) exchange rate policy is&#13;
necessarily superior to a fully flexible rate one in welfare-theoretic terms.&#13;
With a fixed exchange rate the automatic disabsorption resulting from&#13;
the foreign currency losses associated with the payments deficit, discussed&#13;
above, will not entail any other relative price changes. In a sense, this&#13;
case coincides with the 'neutral' disabsorption policies we had assumed in the&#13;
previous section.&#13;
By contrast, reducing the budget deficit and/or reserve ratios could&#13;
have further relative price and thence real effects on the economy.&#13;
Consider (a), the reduction of the budget deficit. Concerned as we&#13;
are primarily in this paper with the effects of stabilisation policies on&#13;
income distribution, any change in the composition or levels of the transfer&#13;
payments associated with the reduction of the budget deficit will have obvious&#13;
direct distributional effects.   Moreover, if these changes lead to a&#13;
different composition of demand for tradealbles relative to non-tradeables (at&#13;
given relative prices of the two), the community indifference curve map in the&#13;
Salter diagram will alter, and thence the 'new' long run equilibrium will&#13;
entail an alteration in the 'real' exchange rate, with the accompanying&#13;
changes in real wages and real profit rates discussed above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Secondly, any change in the composition or level of the investment or&#13;
pure consumption part of the government budget, could also lead to a similar&#13;
change in the economy's 'tastes' (if these government expenditures are large&#13;
relative to total domestic expenditure), with similar 'real' effects as in the&#13;
case discussed above.&#13;
What of (b), changes in the reserve ratio? Their real effects will&#13;
depend upon the relationship between the domestic rate of inflation, the&#13;
distortion in the market for commercial bank term deposits, and lending to the&#13;
non-bank public. Most Third World governments levy an inflation tax. This&#13;
can be readily derived as the real income flow which accrues to the government&#13;
from increasing high powered money (H) through the budget deficit&#13;
GB =A H    from (3.3) and (3.7).  Denoting the price level by  P  and the&#13;
absolute rate of change of high powered money by H , we have&#13;
GB/P = A/P = (A/H) (H/P) = a(H/P)&#13;
where  a    A/H is the proportionate rate of change in base money.  So the&#13;
real revenue that the government can extract from the banking system will&#13;
depend upon the percentage change in high powered money.&#13;
Furthermore, if the rate of inflation   r  is determined by the&#13;
difference between the rates of growth of money supply and real income (y),&#13;
and as the former is determined through the given money multiplier by the rate&#13;
of growth of high powered money,&#13;
7T = a  y,&#13;
so that for any given rate of real income growth, a steady state inflation&#13;
rate will be associated with a given steady state budget deficit financed by&#13;
this inflation tax. Furthermore, following McKinnon [1981], a relationship&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
can be established between the rate of inflation, the reserve ratio&#13;
requirements, and the nominal and real term deposit rates and commercial bank&#13;
lending rates.&#13;
Figure 8 illustrates this market for loanable funds.  The  DL  curve&#13;
shows the demand for commercial bank loans as a function of the real loan&#13;
interest rate   (r. = i  - i)  for any given level of real income  (Y.) .&#13;
The DT curve shows the demand for term deposits as a function of the real&#13;
deposit interest rate, rd = (id - t ). The supply of loanable funds&#13;
(assuming for simplicity that these form the only source of commercial bank&#13;
loans, as demand deposits have to be fully backed by cash and central bank&#13;
reserves), is then given by the curve SL , which is just (1-k) times the&#13;
term deposits that will be forthcoming at any real interest rate.&#13;
Initially, assuming no interest rate regulations and steady state&#13;
inflation at the rate  X  , which corresponds to a given steady state real&#13;
budget deficit GB/P, we have the equilibrium shown, with OR, the total time&#13;
deposits, induced by the equilibrium deposit rate rd, of which (given the&#13;
percent reserve requirement) LR are held as reserves at the central bank&#13;
and OL are lent out to the non-bank public at the marked clearing real loan&#13;
rate of   ri .   Given the relevant elasticities of demand for term deposits&#13;
and commercial bank loans, the inflation tax, for a given reserve ratio (k)&#13;
is in this steady state shown by the distance ab and is borne by both&#13;
depositors and borrowers, whose real market returns and costs differ from the&#13;
full equilibrium rate of r .&#13;
Assuming the banking system is competitive, it must be the case that&#13;
as it pays and receives the nominal interest rates (i)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
id OR = it.OL = it(OR)(1-k)&#13;
or          id = (1-k)l .&#13;
From this it can readily be derived that as&#13;
rd + = id   and   rI +   =iQ&#13;
rg   rd =     l   +rd) =i- id.&#13;
The difference in real and nominal rates will depend directly upon the&#13;
inflation rate r and the reserve ratio k for any given real return on&#13;
time deposits. For any given reserve ratio, k, an increase in inflation (r )&#13;
caused by a higher budget deficit will lead to a bigger wedge between&#13;
rk and rd  (assuming that the nominal deposit rate id rises by the rise in&#13;
inflation). This can be seen from Figure 8.&#13;
Furthermore, if there are interest ceilings on the nominal deposit&#13;
rate, then the real deposit rate rd declines as much as the increase in the&#13;
rate of inflation r and the wedge between the real and nominal interest rate&#13;
remains constant. However, the deposit interest ceilings will, ceteris&#13;
paribus, reduce the size of the loanable funds market, leading to a "crowding&#13;
out' effect on the private borrowers, with the obvious inefficiencies that&#13;
this financial repression entails (see McKinnon (1981)). If there are also&#13;
ceilings on the nominal lending rate, then, with an increase in the inflation&#13;
rate, the real loan interest rate will decline and the excess demand for&#13;
loanable funds will have to be met by rationing, with the attendant&#13;
distortions that causes in the capital market. Removing interest ceilings,&#13;
therefore, will both expand the supply of loanable funds and remove the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
capital market distortions discussed in section 1. This, as was shown, will&#13;
ceteris paribus, raise real wages both in the short and long runs.&#13;
Changing the reserve ratio is equivalent to shifting the 'inflation&#13;
tax' levied to finance the fiscal deficit. For the reserve ratio on interest&#13;
bearing deposits is a way of levying an inflation tax on the 'loanable funds'&#13;
of the banking system. However, McKinnon and Mathieson (1981) have recently&#13;
shown that, to finance a given fiscal deficit at minimum cost in terms of the&#13;
accompanying 'steady state' inflation rate, there will be an optimum reserve&#13;
ratio. This can be seen as follows. IfE there were no reserve requirements,&#13;
the government would have to finance its given fiscal deficit entirely through&#13;
the inflation tax levied on the 'currency and demand deposits' component of&#13;
the money supply, as it would receive no contribution from the "term deposit"&#13;
component. For any given composition oif demand and term deposits of the money&#13;
supply it would thus have to expand high powered money by more than it would&#13;
have if the 'tax' on term deposits could be levied. The higher money supply&#13;
will, ceteris paribus, entail a higher inflation rate. As the reserve ratio&#13;
is raised, the term deposit component will contribute its share to the 'tax'&#13;
and a lower inflation rate will therefore be sustainable.&#13;
However, with rising reserve ratios the term deposit component starts&#13;
shrinking, for any given total money stock, as the rising reserve ratio,&#13;
ceteris paribus, reduces the supply of term deposits because of the changes it&#13;
induces in the nominal deposit and loan interest rates. This shrinking of the&#13;
'term deposit' tax base, means that at some point (depending upon the relevant&#13;
elasticities of the demand for the two f-inancial assets) the revenue from&#13;
raising the 'tax' (on a reducing tax base) will start declining, and to&#13;
finance the same fiscal deficits, a larger 'tax' will have to be levied on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
'demand deposits' by increasing the money supply further, leading to a higher&#13;
inflation rate. Thus the relationship between the steady state inflation rate&#13;
associated with different reserve ratios jointly required to provide the&#13;
'revenue' to meet a given fiscal deficit will be U-shaped. Any reserve ratio&#13;
less than the optimal one (given by the bottom of the U) as well as a higher&#13;
one will entail higher inflation.&#13;
The steady-state inflation that is thus generated at the optimal&#13;
reserve ratio with a given fiscal deficit will entail a continuing rise in the&#13;
price of non-traded goods and if the nominal exchange rate is fixed, a&#13;
continuing fall in the real exchange rate. If this can be sustained, it would&#13;
imply a rise in real wages. But the fall in the real exchange rate will,&#13;
through its switching effects, entail a balance of payments deficit, which&#13;
with limited foreign exchange reserves cannot be sustained.&#13;
However, if the government adopted a floating exchange rate the&#13;
nominal exchange rate would alter to restore and maintain a constant, real&#13;
exchange rate (assuming as we are that this is the steady state one), and the&#13;
steady state inflation process could continue indefinitely. However, there&#13;
would be obvious real income losses associated with the levying of the&#13;
inflation tax, and the associated financial repression. If it is possible to&#13;
finance the fiscal deficit by other taxes which entail smaller by-product&#13;
distortion costs than the inflation tax, then it will be welfare improving to&#13;
reduce the fiscal deficit. In this process as the need to finance the fiscal&#13;
deficit through the 'seignorage' extracted from the banking system declines,&#13;
the optimal reserve ratio, as well as the inflation rate will decline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3. Conclusions&#13;
Enough has been said to show that the short and long run real effects&#13;
of stabilisation and adjustment policies can be thought through in the above&#13;
simple general equilibrium framework. It may be useful to put together some&#13;
of these results in a schematic table, and this is done in Table 2.&#13;
II.  MINIMISING THE WELFARE COSTS OF ADJUSTMENT&#13;
Suppose that the government of an LDC finds itself in a 'crisis' and&#13;
accepts the advice commonly contained in stabilisation and adjustment&#13;
programs. 1/ These are (a) to reduce absorption through (i) reducing the&#13;
fiscal deficit and through (ii) monitoring and controlling overall domestic&#13;
credit (DC) in the economy, (iii) and if expenditure switching is required--a&#13;
devaluation; (b) measures to improve the supply side of the economy, which&#13;
include (i) reducing trade distortions, (ii) reducing other commodity market&#13;
distortions caused by inappropriate administered prices, (iii) reducing&#13;
distortions in the capital market by reducing the degree of financial&#13;
repression through removing interest rate ceilings, changing reserve&#13;
requirements, and possibly removing exchange controls.&#13;
In a crisis situation, the disabsorption measures under (a) are&#13;
unavoidable. Only their extent is an issue. This, as we argued in the&#13;
introduction, depends upon the level of foreign financial accommodation avail-&#13;
able. The desirable level of this accommodation is a matter of judgment and I&#13;
have little to add to the earlier discussion.&#13;
1/    Discussions of these will be found in Guitian on the Fund's&#13;
conditionality, and in Stern in Williamson (ed.) on the Bank's&#13;
structural adjustment programmes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
The remaining question concerns the sequencing of the 'supply-side'&#13;
policy reforms under (b) above, and whether there are any other policies which&#13;
might be able to minimise the inevitable costs of adjustment. For these&#13;
policies, by altering relative prices, will lead to changes in production as&#13;
well as in the distribution of income.&#13;
1. Points of Comparison&#13;
It is useful to consider the various policy reforms on the supply&#13;
side ((b) above] initially for an economy with wage flexibility and perfect&#13;
capital mobility so that the long run outcomes shown in Table 2 are&#13;
established. This provides a reference case to compare the various other&#13;
cases when the 'structure' of the economy is different. Two questions arise:&#13;
(i) whether there are any efficiency losses associated with the movement to&#13;
the new equilibria, and (ii) whether there are any harmful equity effects.&#13;
First, note that the unsustainable real expenditure at the start of the crisis&#13;
has already been dealt with by the disabsorption package [under (a)], so the&#13;
relevant point of comparison is either the situation before the unsustainable&#13;
"boom" got going for whatever reason, or with the situation after the&#13;
requisite disabsorption has been undertaken. It is not a valid criticism of&#13;
the stabilisation package that it leads to a fall in real expenditures and&#13;
(possibly) short run output as compared with the situation during the boom.&#13;
For, ex hypothesi, this level of expenditure is unsustainable, and the&#13;
relevant real expenditure reduction is unavoidable. A comparison of the&#13;
aftermath of stabilisation with the stituation immediately preceding it might&#13;
falsely suggest that the necessary cuts in expenditure represent avoidable&#13;
losses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Of the other two points of comparison, in analyzing the effects of&#13;
the supply side adjustment package [under (b)] I would favor looking at the&#13;
situation preceding the boom, if that is possible. For typically it will be&#13;
difficult in practice to separate out the effects of particular instruments,&#13;
such as a devaluation, on stabilization as compared with adjustment so that&#13;
the position following the stabilization and before the adjustment begins may&#13;
not be clearly defined.&#13;
In fact, in most (but not all) of our comparative static exercises in&#13;
the previous part we have been making comparisons of the short run (impact)&#13;
and long run effects of particular policy changes on real output and real&#13;
factor returns based on comparisons before the boom and after the&#13;
stabilization has restored the status quo ante.&#13;
2. 'Optimal' Sequencing of Policy Reforms&#13;
We can now readily answer the welfare theoretic questions posed. It&#13;
is obvious that for an economy where the adjustments in both capital and&#13;
labour markets are rapid, all the policy changes proposed in the package must&#13;
necessarily improve efficiency and hence lead monotonically to higher levels&#13;
of real national income till the new 'undlistorted' equilibrium is reached.&#13;
Moreover, as is obvious from Table 2, the effects on real factor&#13;
returns, particularly real wages in the long run, of all these possible policy&#13;
reforms is positive (as we would expect, given our factor intensity assumption&#13;
and the assumption that most of the distortions are in the "traded" capital-&#13;
intensive sector).  Thus there would (at least for the fairly flexible&#13;
'textbook' economy whose outcomes correspond to the Marshallian 'long run') be&#13;
no efficiency or equity losses entailed by the standard adjustment package.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
It is short run immobilities of capital and rigidities of wages which&#13;
can lead to, in some cases, short run falls in real income and/or in real&#13;
wages (as we saw in Part II). Two questions then arise: (1) whether there&#13;
are likely to be feasible supplementary public policies which could minimise&#13;
these efficiency and/or equity losses during the transition; and (2) whether&#13;
there is a sequencing of policies within the adjustment package which will&#13;
reduce the 'pain' of the transition.&#13;
On the first question, initially consider the case with wage&#13;
rigidity. It is well known from the modern project evaluation literature that&#13;
any 'stickiness' or rigidity makes the shadow wage lower than the actual wage&#13;
rate [see Lal (1974) (1980a)]. In theory, a wage subsidy financed by lump sum&#13;
taxes would yield the best outcome along the transition. If this is not&#13;
possible, then some suitable tax-subsidy combination which essentially&#13;
subsidizes the output of the labor intensive industry may be desirable. As it&#13;
will not be usually feasible to institute a general wage subsidy in most&#13;
developing countries, where much of employment is self-employment, it may be&#13;
only feasible to use the output tax subsidy route. As we require a general&#13;
subsidy to the labor-intensive sectors, we can provide this by in effect&#13;
taxing the output of the capital intensive sector, that is, in effect by&#13;
lowering the real exchange rate (if this is feasible). Bhagwati (1979) and&#13;
Krueger (1978) detail various ways in which the removal of trade distortions&#13;
and changes in the nominal exchange rate can be combined to yield the&#13;
required lowering of the real exchange rate.&#13;
But whilst this is likely to improve efficiency if capital is quasi-&#13;
fixed, as it is likely to be, the combined effects of a reduction in output&#13;
distortions and devaluation (required to obtain the required real exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3S -&#13;
rate change) on short run real wages is likely to be ambiguous. It will&#13;
depend on the relative "traded" good intensities in the production of the two&#13;
composite goods, as well as on their elasticities of labour demand. If these&#13;
lie within a certain range, then the short-run real wage outcome can be&#13;
forecast and it may turn out that the real wage and real income effects are&#13;
both positive.&#13;
Suppose they are not. In that case, there may be a danger of real&#13;
wage falls, which could lead to inequitable short run outcomes.&#13;
By contrast, as we saw in part I, removing the capital market&#13;
distortion will entail a necessary improvement in both real output and real&#13;
wages in both the long and short runs. This suggests the following sequencing&#13;
of the adjustment package. First, remove the capital market distortion and,&#13;
as the real output and real wage gains began to appear, begin a phased&#13;
programme of reduction of distortions in the commodity markets (particularly&#13;
for traded goods). The possible short-run declines in real wages flowing from&#13;
the second phase being mitigated by the rises flowing from the continuation of&#13;
the first phase of policy reform.&#13;
Removing the capital market distortions, however, is a tricky problem&#13;
for a 'financially repressed' economy as we saw in the last section of Part&#13;
I. It is clear that, as a first step, interest ceilings on deposits and loans&#13;
should be removed. If the distributional impact of these changes is to be&#13;
spread over a period of time, then (parallel to the well known welfare&#13;
optimising method for a phased liberalization of a distorted trade regime) the&#13;
quantitative credit controls (which imply capital subsidies to favoured&#13;
borrowers) should be converted into explicit subsidies and shown as part of&#13;
the government budget. Without any increase in government revenues the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
consequent rise in the fiscal deficit will require the levying of a higher&#13;
inflation tax, but, with a suitable adjustment of the reserve ratio (which&#13;
need not necessarily imply an increase in this ratio) 1/ on the interest&#13;
bearing component of the domestic money supply.&#13;
But, most important, to keep the economy at the new steady state&#13;
inflation rate 2/ it will be necessary to continuously alter the nominal&#13;
exchange rate at the same rate as the steady state inflation rate to maintain&#13;
a constant real exchange rate. A fixed nominal exchange rate would not be&#13;
sustainable. Over time, in order to reduce the inefficiencies flowing from&#13;
the financial repression associated with high reserve ratios, it will be&#13;
necessary to reduce the fiscal deficit and thence the inflation rate. But&#13;
whether or not this reduction in the steady state inflation rate will be&#13;
welfare improving depends, as was argued in the last section of Part I, on the&#13;
alternative net social costs of reducing government expenditure and/or raising&#13;
taxes to reduce the fiscal deficit. It may be better to sequence the&#13;
inflation control programme after the removal of interest ceilings, the&#13;
introduction of flexibility in exchange rates, and the phased programme of&#13;
trade liberalisation. In fact, to the extent government revenue rises with&#13;
real national income and the government's real expenditure remains unchanged,&#13;
1/    See McKinnon and Mathieson (1981).  Thus if in Figure 9 the economy&#13;
initially had a steady state inflation rate and reserve ratio given by A&#13;
for the steady state fiscal deficit Z0, the rise in the steady state&#13;
fiscal deficit entails an optimal reserve ratio of B &lt; A, but of course&#13;
a higher steady state inflation rate. It is only if the initial steady&#13;
state inflation cum reserve ratio position was to the left of C, that a&#13;
rise in reserve ratios will be the optimum policy.&#13;
2/    Point B in Fig. 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
the real fiscal deficit and hence the reserve ratio and inflation rate should&#13;
all fall to some extent through the feedback effects of the other policy&#13;
changes.&#13;
But against this we must set varioDus arguments concerning the&#13;
political economy of reducing the fiscal deficit as well as the distortionary&#13;
welfare costs of maintaining an inflationary environment. Though in theory we&#13;
can couch our arguments in terms of steady state inflation rates, in practice&#13;
it will be very difficult for a government to do so. It may, therefore, be&#13;
best to combine the reform of the domestic capital market with the reduction&#13;
of the fiscal deficit and inflation.  The last part of this initial package&#13;
being made easier by the likelihood that some reduction in the fiscal deficit&#13;
will have formed part of the initial disabsorption required to deal with the&#13;
"crisis". So the first stage of the adjustment package should probably&#13;
combine the reduction of domestic capital market distortion with the reduction&#13;
of the fiscal deficit and inflation.&#13;
The next stage would be to remove exchange controls and institute&#13;
free floating of the exchange rate accompanied by an announcement of the&#13;
phased programme for removing commodity market distortions, which for the&#13;
reasons given above, should follow the freeing of the capital account after a&#13;
lag of, say, one year. The final stage would be to remove the commodity&#13;
market distortions according to a preannounced phased programme.&#13;
However, with the removal of domestic interest rate ceilings, if a&#13;
managed exchange rate regime is sought, then, as McKinnon and Mathieson have&#13;
argued, it may be necessary to maintain tight exchange controls. Without&#13;
these, they argue, the ability of the government to maintain a steady state&#13;
inflation rate to obtain the seignorage required to finance the fiscal deficit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
is eroded. For without exchange controls domestic borrowers may find that at&#13;
a fixed exchange rate, or one indexed to changes in the domestic price level,&#13;
they can borrow more cheaply abroad as liberalised domestic interest rates are&#13;
much higher; that is, private foreign borrowing may be stimulated by the&#13;
domestic inflation tax. These inflows, moreover, will directly expand the&#13;
foreign currency component of high powered money and thereby the domestic&#13;
money supply and lead to higher inflation rates than are required to finance&#13;
the steady state fiscal deficit in their absence.&#13;
This argument, of course, assumes that full flexibility of exchange&#13;
rates is neither feasible nor desirable for the financially repressed&#13;
economy. I have argued elsewhere (see Lal (1980)) for the feasibility and&#13;
desirability of free floating for most LDC's and will not repeat the arguments&#13;
here. However, if free floating can be instituted, then exchange controls&#13;
will have to be removed; but, as under a free float, the effects of foreign&#13;
currency flows on the domestic money supply are automatically sterilised, the&#13;
policy of maintaining the new steady state inflation rate 1/ will be&#13;
sustainable.&#13;
The above suggests the following sequencing of policies in the&#13;
adjustment package may be second best welfare optima. First, remove the&#13;
capital market distortion by removing interest ceilings, converting implicit&#13;
into explicit interest subsidies by incorporating them in the government&#13;
budget, and if these cannot be financed at a lower welfare cost in terms of&#13;
taxation, then, accepting a slightly higher steady state inflation rate,&#13;
1/    Point B of Fig. 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
coupled with possibly higher reserve ratios, these reforms being accompanied&#13;
by instituting a free floating exchange rate regime. Next, start reducing the&#13;
commodity market distortions, particularly those in the traded good sector.&#13;
Finally, bring the fiscal deficit down, ancd with it the inflation rate and&#13;
reserve ratios.&#13;
However, a number of objections can be raised against this&#13;
sequencing. These primarily concern the removal of exchange control and free&#13;
floating at the second stage of the reforms, and the postponement of the&#13;
disinflationary process through the reduction of the fiscal deficit to the&#13;
final stage. We take these in turn and see! whether they merit our altering&#13;
the above sequencing.&#13;
There are two major objections to removing exchange controls before&#13;
removing the distortions in the commodity market (chiefly through trade&#13;
liberalization). The first concerns the possibility of foreign capital&#13;
inflows which might be induced as a result of the liberalization of the&#13;
capital account of the balance of payments being immiserising. Theoretically,&#13;
the possibility of capital inflows into an economy with distortions in&#13;
domestic commodity markets being immiserising has been established by Brecher&#13;
and Diaz-Alejandro (1977). However, as in our proposed package, the&#13;
liberalization of the capital account would be accompanied by an announcement&#13;
of a future dated and phased programme of reduction in commodity market&#13;
distortions, it is unlikely that long term capital flows (based on a time&#13;
horizon of investors extending beyond the trade liberalization phase) would be&#13;
immiserising. Whilst to the extent that capital with shorter maturities is&#13;
likely to flow into activities where, during the trade liberalization phase,&#13;
private and social rates of return diverge, there may be a case for temporary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
and preannouncei taxes on flows by maturity which decrease each year until&#13;
zero, as the trade liberalisation proceeds.&#13;
The second objection relates to the likelihood that the real exchange&#13;
rate will initially fall with the removal of exchange control in the above&#13;
sequencing of policies. The argument can be stated as follows. With the&#13;
liberalisation of the domestic capital market, real rates of interest will&#13;
rise domestically and, given the relative scarcity of capital, are likely to&#13;
be higher than foreign interest rates at the original exchange rate. With the&#13;
removal of exchange control and the institution of a free float, to establish&#13;
interest rate parity, the nominal exchange rate will appreciate, and if, in&#13;
the ensuing process of balance of payments adjustment, capital also flows into&#13;
the country, the real exchange rate will fall as the country runs a balance of&#13;
trade deficit to match the surplus on the capital account of the balance of&#13;
payments. However, given that the preannounced programme of trade&#13;
liberalisation is credible, investors in the domestic economy will expect the&#13;
nominal exchange rate to depreciate and the real rate to appreciate as the&#13;
trade liberalisation proceeds. It is unlikely, therefore, unless producers&#13;
are assumed to be myopic, that the immediate signal given by the initial fall&#13;
in the real exchange rate will lead to short run resource movements which are&#13;
the opposite of those required in the long run as trade liberalisation&#13;
proceeds.  In fact, one of the major advantages of instituting a free float&#13;
before trade is liberalized is that the nominal exchange rate changes which&#13;
are required during the process of liberalisation become automatic. For it is&#13;
very difficult in practice to judge the precise extent of the required&#13;
exchange rate change as trade liberalisation proceeds in a system with a&#13;
managed exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
The major objection against sequencing the removal of the fiscal&#13;
deficit after the institution of a free float is that this will lead to a&#13;
higher steady state inflation rate and fiscal deficit in the interregnum than&#13;
would be the case with the fiscal deficit being eliminated before exchange&#13;
controls. This can be seen in terms of the relationship between the&#13;
proportionate change in base money ( a ), the price level (P), and the real&#13;
revenue the government can extract from the banking system (GB/P), which we&#13;
had outlined in the previous section. IE, with the institution of a free&#13;
float, the nominal exchange rate depreciates, it will lead to a rise in the&#13;
domestic price level (as the domestic price of tradeables rises). This will&#13;
lower the real revenue extracted for the initial level of the fiscal&#13;
deficit. To raise the same real revenue from the inflation tax, the rate of&#13;
growth of base money and the size of the steady state fiscal deficit will have&#13;
to be increased.&#13;
But it should immediately be apparent that this last objection rests&#13;
on assuming that the impact effect of instituting a free float will be a&#13;
depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, and hence implies a rise in the&#13;
real exchange rate. However, the previous objection to the phased sequencing&#13;
of a free floating rate regime was based on assuming that the linking of the&#13;
domestic and foreign capital markets by removing exchange control would lead&#13;
to a rise in the nominal and fall in the real exchange rate. As clearly the&#13;
nominal exchange rate cannot both rise and fall at the same time, critics of&#13;
the proposed sequencing cannot use both of the last two objections. If, as&#13;
seems likely, the removal of domestic capital market distortions leads to a&#13;
higher domestic real rate of interest thaLn abroad at the initial nominal&#13;
exchange rate, removal of exchange controls and the institution of free&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
floating will lead to an appreciation of the nominal exchange rate, and thence&#13;
an initial reduction in the domestic price level, with a consequent reduction&#13;
in the required growth of high powered money and a lower steady state fiscal&#13;
deficit, to collect the same real revenues from the inflation tax.  To that&#13;
extent the proposed sequencing should make the subsequent task of avoiding&#13;
inflation easier.&#13;
III.   SOME STYLISED 'CRISES' AND WHEN IS A 'CRISIS' A CRISIS?&#13;
In Part I we had worked through various cases in terms of some simple&#13;
typologies, where the major differences in 'structure' we considered were&#13;
differences based on (a) wage flexibility versus wage stickiness and (b)&#13;
flexible and quasi-fixed sectoral capital stocks.&#13;
Another useful taxonomy is based on the differing sources of the&#13;
excess absorption which usually leads to "crises".&#13;
The case of excess absorption generated through the monetary ex-&#13;
pansion accompanying increased government expenditure during the political&#13;
cycle has already been dealt with in previous parts. Lal (1983), provides an&#13;
illustration from the Philippines. In this case with money wage flexibility,&#13;
either allowing a leakage of the domestic money supply through the payments&#13;
deficit at a fixed exchange rate, or else a contraction of real money balances&#13;
through a devaluation, would restore all real variables to their original&#13;
values, and, in the process the initial rise in real wages would eventually be&#13;
reversed, as absorption fell back to its original and sustainable level.&#13;
Another 'cause' of 'crises' are windfall losses and gains of 'foreign&#13;
currency'.  Here, it is useful to distinguish between those windfalls which&#13;
accrue directly to the public sector and those which accrue to the private&#13;
sector. The foreign currency rents derived from minerals by the public sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
and the foreign currency receipts derived from remittances by their relatives&#13;
working abroad by the private sector would be two instances.&#13;
1. Private Sector Windfalls&#13;
Take the case of remittances first. Assume the exchange rate is&#13;
fixed. The private sector now receives foreign exchange remittances, which it&#13;
exchanges for domestic currency at the Central Bank, whose foreign currency&#13;
assets rise, but are matched initially by an equivalent increase in the&#13;
currency and demand deposit component of the domestic money supply. High&#13;
powered money has, however, risen, and the domestic money supply will, pari&#13;
pasu, expand unless the government takes some countervailing action by either&#13;
reducing its own demand for credit by redlucing the fiscal deficit, or reducing&#13;
commercial credit through raising the reserve ratio.&#13;
Suppose it does not sterilize the effects of these inflows on the&#13;
domestic money supply. ceteris paribus the expansion in money supply will&#13;
lead, at the fixed exchange rate, to a rise in the price of non-traded goods&#13;
and a trade deficit. From Table 2, the i.mpact effect on the real wage will be&#13;
ambiguous. But with the loss of foreign exchange reserves accompanying the&#13;
trade deficit, the high powered money base and thus the domestic money supply&#13;
will automatically contract till the initial equilibrium will have been&#13;
restored. In this process the "real goods" counterpart, of the foreign&#13;
remittance transfer on capital account will have been affected through the&#13;
trade deficit.&#13;
Is there any problem or 'crisis' that such a country faces? It will&#13;
apparently have an initial boom in which inflation would pick up and a balance&#13;
of payments deficit will have appeared. Though these two are usually taken to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
be signs of a 'crisis', such a diagnosis would clearly be mistaken in this&#13;
case.&#13;
However, suppose, as is likely, there is some time lag between the&#13;
receipt of the remittances on capital account and their 'implicit' spending&#13;
subsequently through the trade account.   In the interim, foreign exchange&#13;
reserves would have risen. Suppose, as is only too likely in many developing&#13;
countries, the government does not use the notion of high powered money in its&#13;
budgetary planning. The treasury looks at the rising foreign exchange&#13;
reserves and is advised by various economists that it should use these&#13;
'reserves' for development purposes by in effect running a larger budget&#13;
deficit than it would otherwise. But as, ex hypothesi, (and usually in&#13;
practice) it has not sterilized the foreign exchange inflows, any further&#13;
increase in high powered money which would be entailed by the larger budget&#13;
deficit merely increases the money supply to an even higher level. Whereas,&#13;
without this increase in the government's fiscal deficit, both the domestic&#13;
inflationary process and the trade deficit would have been self-correcting,&#13;
this further expansion will entail further inflation and a larger trade&#13;
deficit. Their reversal through the "money-specie" flow mechanism would&#13;
entail a loss of foreign exchange reserves, greater than those that had been&#13;
received through the remittances. As the government, ex hypothesi, had not&#13;
intended to run down its initial level of reserves, it now finds itself de&#13;
facto with an incipient run-down. It now has a balance of payments problem&#13;
whose cure will require the disabsorption we have earlier discussed.&#13;
But this 'crisis' is due to a misperception of the correct accounting&#13;
system in an economy, on a fixed exchange rate, which is unable or unwilling&#13;
to sterilize foreign currency flows--in particular, the relationship between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
high powered money, the fiscal deficit (properly defined) and the movements in&#13;
foreign reserves. Unless these are understood and the proper accounting&#13;
framework is adopted, even though the government may (through financing or&#13;
adjustment) tide over this crisis, it is likely that it will continually get&#13;
into such crises. The adoption of the correct accounting framework for&#13;
budgetary and monetary management may thus be as important a part of avoiding&#13;
crises as any shocks administered by 'nature' or by the 'external world'.&#13;
2. Public Sector Windfalls&#13;
The second 'crisis' is that flowing from windfall foreign currency&#13;
gains/losses accruing to the public sector, say, through obtaining the rents&#13;
from mineral exploitation. Consider two radically different ways in which the&#13;
government could in principle spend these rents.   First, suppose it decides&#13;
to hand them out on some suitable criterion of equity as annual handouts to&#13;
its citizens.   A seemingly equivalent policy would be for the government to&#13;
reduce general taxation by the annual inflow of these rents, or else to expand&#13;
government expenditure. If the social value of the tax cuts or increased&#13;
government expenditure is considered to be greater than that arising from&#13;
giving a form of national dividend to its populace (a doubtful proposition),&#13;
then the direct public use of these rents would seem to be desirable.&#13;
Moreover, as long as the increase in government expenditure is covered by&#13;
sales of the foreign currency to the central bank, the governments open fiscal&#13;
deficit which needs to be covered by domestic government borrowing need not&#13;
rise. But, nevertheless, unless the government actually reduces domestic&#13;
credit (see Section III of Part 2), high powered money will increase with&#13;
these inflows of foreign currency, that is, unless they are sterilized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
The consequent rise in domestic money expenditure will raise the&#13;
price level as (at a fixed exchange rate) the money prices of nontraded goods&#13;
rise; part of the excess money demand will spill over into a trade deficit&#13;
financed by running down the newly built up foreign currency reserves. This&#13;
will tend to reduce the domestic money supply and bring the prices of non-&#13;
traded goods down to their original level, and with it the overall price&#13;
level.&#13;
But at a fixed exchange rate the relative price of non-traded goods&#13;
is likely to remain permanently higher, as with a continuing inflow of foreign&#13;
currency rents the required size of the domestic tradeables sector has become&#13;
smaller.  Tb induce and validate the relative expansion of non-tradeables, the&#13;
real exchange rate will have to remain permanently lower until the foreign&#13;
currency rents run out.&#13;
The requisite rise in the non-traded good relative price need not&#13;
come about through this inflationary process if instead the government chose&#13;
to appreciate the nominal exchange rate by the appropriate amount. But, in&#13;
all this, so far there does not appear to be any problem! True the country&#13;
will be running a balance of payments deficit and suffering inflationary&#13;
pressures if it seeks to maintain a fixed nominal or a higher than equilibrium&#13;
real exchange rate.&#13;
A problem would arise if the increased level of government&#13;
expenditure was unsustainable over the long run. This could happen if it&#13;
misjudged the size of the annual foreign exchange flows and committed itself&#13;
to long maturing investment or else unsustainable consumption support&#13;
programmes, which would need to be cut back if there were any falling off in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
expected foreign exchange rents. The public sector programme may then be&#13;
unsustainable.&#13;
If, however, the rents had been transferred to the general populace,&#13;
each individual would have his current income increased as well as improved&#13;
expectations of future rises in income. On _this basis they would make decen-&#13;
tralized choices of their privately optima'L consumption/investment mix, which&#13;
would involve portfolio choices between diEferent financial assets. The&#13;
resulting pattern of deficits and surpluses on current/capital accounts of the&#13;
balance of payments would have no welfare significance.&#13;
3. Public Sector Crises and Accounting Procedures&#13;
These two examples, therefore, illustrate that most so-called balance&#13;
of payments "crises" are in larger part "crises" for the public sector and&#13;
reflect misjudgements about its appropriate size and or composition. 1/ The&#13;
cures, however, to the extent they involve the use of policy instruments which&#13;
entail changes in relative prices will have real, distributional&#13;
consequences. We have sought to provide a simple framework to think through&#13;
these effects, and to form judgements on the welfare-optimal sequence of their&#13;
deployment. But, in order to avoid 'crises', it may be more important to&#13;
reconsider the accounting and other procedures commonly used to manage and&#13;
control the public sector, and to see whether procedures can be derived which&#13;
will both show up an incipient 'problem' for the public sector before it&#13;
becomes a 'crisis' and also prevent such crises from happening. As a start,&#13;
the notion of high powered money and its links with the fiscal deficit need to&#13;
1/    This is the important insight contain,ed in Corden (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
be explicitly stated in the accounting procedures for designing monetary&#13;
policy as well as the government budget.   Though elementary, the payoff from&#13;
such a reform may be quite high if most of the painful side effects of dealing&#13;
with many public sector generated 'crises' turn out to be merely the result of&#13;
improper accounting!&#13;
IV. APPLYING THE FRAMEWORK&#13;
In applying the framework provided in part I, it will be necessary to&#13;
obtain data anci form judgments on a few crucial features of the particular&#13;
economy. The first is on the relative factor intensities of 'traded' and&#13;
'nontraded' goods. For countries with relatively updated input-output tables,&#13;
by suitable aggregation of the various productive sectors, a composite table&#13;
can be obtained which provides a breakdown of the costs of production of the&#13;
two composite commodities into traded, non-traded, and primary factor&#13;
inputs. From these the crucial parameters required to predict the likely&#13;
movements in the real wage (in the short and long run) following a change in&#13;
the real exchange rate can be estimated (see Lal (1983)).&#13;
Secondly, as Table I shows, the impact effect of changes in relative&#13;
commodity prices (through the removal or reduction of product market&#13;
distortions), will differ depending upon the extent of money wage flexibility.&#13;
It will, therefore, be necessary to form a judgment whether, in the relevant&#13;
economy, money wages are likely to be sticky.&#13;
Thirdly, if a managed exchange rate regime is being operated it will&#13;
be necessary to determine both if there are any available instruments and if&#13;
they have been used to sterilise the monetary effects of foreign currency&#13;
flows. This can be indirectly inferred from monetary statistics on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
sources of past changes in high powered money by using the various accounting&#13;
identities summarised in Part I, Section 2 (B), above.&#13;
Fourthly, it will be necessary to form some estimate of the inflation&#13;
tax extracted by the existing reserve ratios, interest rate ceilings, and the&#13;
fiscal deficit. An estimate of this can be derived from past movements in&#13;
these variables and data on price inflation.&#13;
Finally, just as it is now commonplace to derive some estimates of&#13;
product market distortions in terms of the divergence between market and&#13;
shadow prices of commodities on well-known lines, it will also be necessary to&#13;
determine the pattern and size of capital market distortions by documenting&#13;
and if possible quantifying the implicit taxes and subsidies given to&#13;
different sectors through various forms of credit control.&#13;
Armed with this data, the first task must be to try and tell a&#13;
plausible story of the reasons for the 'crisis'. This will also provide the&#13;
basis for forming a judgment on the situation just after the disabsorption&#13;
required to deal with the immediate crisis has been accomplished (see Part II,&#13;
1). The real effects of alternative policy packages, including the sequencing&#13;
of their components can then be thought t]hrough in terms of the simple real&#13;
cum monetary framework outlined in Part I.&#13;

            The real effects of stabilization and
            structural adjustment policies : an extension of the
            Australian adjustment model

        <abstracts>
            This paper asks if there is anything
            useful that economists can say about minimizing the real
            costs of stabilization and the structural adjustment
            entailed by reforming various inefficient microscopic
            policies in the economy. Of particular concern are the
            effects of these policies on real wage and real profit rates
            in the economy. The paper first outlines a version of the
            orthodox trade theoretic treatment of the small, open
            economy which is sufficiently rich to think through the
            various issues raised in debates over stabilization
            policies. This simple framework is then applied to a model
            case to show how it can be used to answer questions on how
            to minimize the welfare costs of traditional stabilization
            and adjustment packages. The third part of the paper briefly
            discusses the usual reasons why countries get into a crisis
            and whether this can be prevented. The final part of the
            paper explains how the approach outlined in the first two
            parts might be applied in practice in country economic
            analysis by the Bank.
