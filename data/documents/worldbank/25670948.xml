ï»¿ANNEX 1&#13;
Part II Europe 2020 Trust Fund Description&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the&#13;
Trust Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
1. Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Trust Fund are:&#13;
The European Commission and the Bank share a common objective of building competitive and&#13;
sustainable economies and reducing poverty and social exclusion - goals of the Europe 2020 Agenda&#13;
which is built on three pillars of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The European Commission&#13;
and the Bank concur that direct interaction is beneficial to both institutions and through them to the&#13;
beneficiary countries. This applies particularly to the provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge&#13;
services and technical assistance.&#13;
The European Commission has expressed an interest in ensuring that the Bank continues to provide&#13;
technical assistance in the framework of the Trust Fund in furtherance of the common objective set&#13;
forth above.&#13;
2. Activities&#13;
The objectives and description of the activities are:&#13;
The European Commission has expressed an interest in ensuring that the Bank provides technical&#13;
assistance in the framework of the Trust Fund with the specific objective of assisting and supporting&#13;
the Government of Greece to undertake reforms that improve the business environment of Greece with&#13;
particular attention to the regulatory system for investment licensing (IL). The Activities (which&#13;
may be described as "components" of activities) to be financed by the Trust Fund, in support of the&#13;
objective above, and of which the Bank has implementation responsibility, are described below.&#13;
Broadly defined, investment licenses comprises all transactions and costs of all associated fees,&#13;
completed and incurred, respectively, to obtain all of the registrations, licenses, permits,&#13;
authorizations, inspection certificates, consents and approvals that an enterprise must acquire to begin&#13;
operations. In addition, investment licenses comprise all of the information and assessments an&#13;
enterprise is required to provide throughout the process of authorizing the start of operations. Finally,&#13;
the process of obtaining investment licenses also comprises compliance with all rules, regulations and&#13;
other investment agreements an enterprise must conform to as it proceeds from conceptualization of an&#13;
investment in Greek territory to initial business operation.&#13;
One of the repeated obstacles in Greece for investors are the barriers caused by the multiple and&#13;
fragmented permits and licenses which are required to start and carry an activity. In May 2014 the&#13;
4262/2014). The IL law, subsequent secondary legislation, and implementation measures and&#13;
mechanisms will establish a new set of principles and practices for the regulation of economic&#13;
activities in Greece. Effective implementation of the IL Law should introduce more efficiency,&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿transparency and clarity in investment licensing leading to a reduction in the delays and costs&#13;
(including corruption) incurred by investors seeking to start an activity in Greece and throughout the&#13;
business lifetime. The implementation of the IL Law entails a complex and very significant reform&#13;
process that is expected to take some years to be accomplished:&#13;
*  A range of existing regulation will not be consistent with this new legal and regulatory&#13;
framework, and will need to be identified, reviewed, and repealed or revised.&#13;
*  Technical requirements, if found to be less than fully adequate, will also need some revisions&#13;
or additions.&#13;
*  Most importantly, the reform requires a profound transformation in the way regulatory bodies&#13;
work and deliver regulation - less reliance on ex ante licenses, introduction of streamlined&#13;
processes, e-regulation, risk-focused ex post controls, etc.&#13;
The Bank would contribute to the GoG's efforts on above mentioned aspects and comprise in this&#13;
Agreement the review of the IL Law as requested by the Government of Greece where legislation is&#13;
not clear and/or contains gaps, the completion of a preliminary inventory of licenses, an action plan&#13;
and overview of other licensing regimes in other countries to guide the review process, the review of a&#13;
first set of licenses in select priority areas and robust recommendations on the type of revision needed,&#13;
the development of technical requirements when required for select priority areas, the development of&#13;
technical specifications for the e-licensing/e-inspection system, the review of other implementation&#13;
requirements for the IL Law and the development of monitoring and evaluation framework and survey&#13;
to assess the reform impact on businesses.&#13;
This support will be essential for the Greek government to achieve its goal of moving towards a more&#13;
streamlined and simplified investment licensing and a more effective regulatory system for businesses,&#13;
and helping Greece become one of the few Member States relying on risk focused ex-post controls&#13;
(which are more efficient than prescriptive ex-ante regulation).&#13;
The following outputs will be delivered by the Bank:&#13;
Component A: Action plan and overview of licensing regimes&#13;
A.1 The Bank will prepare an action plan specifying steps and tools involved in each of the&#13;
components and activities. The Action Plan will also include an overview of the main elements&#13;
pertaining to reform implementation based on work done so far, challenges encountered, and&#13;
discussions with the GoG and stakeholders. The Bank will also update and further develop the risk&#13;
framework that was developed in 2014 in order to further expose the good practices and principles that&#13;
stem from the law and guide the license review process.&#13;
A.2 The Bank will prepare a brief overview of licensing and similar regulatory requirements for key&#13;
economic activities in selected priority sectors included in the GoG roadmap, covering 1-3 most&#13;
relevant EU or OECD comparator countries (possibly different comparators for different activities),&#13;
and serving as guidance for the review work in Component C.&#13;
Component B: Preliminary inventory of licenses and review of the IL Law&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿B. 1 Based on input from the GoG and its Project Management Team (PMT)l, the Bank will provide&#13;
support to the preparation of a preliminary inventory of existing licenses including through data&#13;
collection based on a standard template, through discussions with business representatives and with&#13;
the ministries involved. The preliminary inventory will, to the extent possible, include relevant&#13;
information about each license (purpose, legal basis, required documentation, issuance process, costs).&#13;
B.2 The Bank will review selected sections of the IL Law to be identified by the GoG and provide&#13;
draft recommendations on how the Law could potentially be strengthened, gaps addressed, and unclear&#13;
sections revised. Examples of potential sections for review include the nature and use of General&#13;
Operating Conditions (GOCs) and how an existing license can be replaced by a simple requirement for&#13;
declaration of start of operations.&#13;
Component C: Review of licensing regulations in select priority areas&#13;
C. 1. The Bank will prepare and deliver training sessions for experts (government and non-&#13;
government) to be involved in the review process. These training sessions will, in particular, focus on&#13;
working groups that are expected to be established by the different relevant Ministries in line with&#13;
Council of Ministers Act No. 21. This will cover the explanation of the risk-based approach,&#13;
international best practice, step-by-step explanation of the review process, and discussion of the data&#13;
requirements necessary for the review and associated analysis to be sufficient. At least one training&#13;
workshop will be delivered at the offset of the project. The Bank will also support the Core Team/GoG&#13;
in outreach and information towards other line ministries on the main changes introduced by the&#13;
reform and the implementation needs. In addition, the Bank will support the Core Team/GoG in&#13;
organizing additional dialogue and consultation sessions with stakeholders/ representative&#13;
organizations and private sector representatives on modifications of the licensing regime.&#13;
C.2. The Bank, in consultation with the Core Team2 (or its successor), will prepare decision memos&#13;
for regulatory areas and/or economic activities within priority sectors identified by the GoG (e.g.&#13;
tourism, food and beverages industry, catering and hospitality, mining). To the extent that it is&#13;
necessary to be selective within these priority sectors, i.e. that reviewing each and every license and&#13;
piece of secondary legislation may require a longer timeframe, review of licenses and legislation in&#13;
these sectors will be prioritized by selecting regulatory areas and/or economic activities through&#13;
consultations between the GoG, Bank and Commission/SRSS, with the aim to achieve the highest&#13;
possible reform impact in line with the roadmap prepared by the GoG. Types of licenses that are&#13;
somewhat lower impact and/or considerably more complex will be reviewed after June 2016, so that&#13;
maximum impact is achieved within the Roadmap's timetable'. Each decision memo will indicate, for&#13;
' The Project Management Team was established through Act No. 21 of the Council of Ministers of August 14, 2015, published in the&#13;
Government's Gazette 96/A/14.8.2015. The PMT is responsible for programing, monitoring, coordinating and initiating the actions required&#13;
for the implementation of Law 4262/2014. It is composed of Secretary Generals from relevant ministries.&#13;
2 The Core Team will be set up by the GoG to provide technical support to the PMT. The Core Team will work closely with the Bank,&#13;
providing, inter alia, technical guidance and comments on the draft decision memos prepared by the Bank, as well as facilitating the contacts&#13;
of the Bank with other competent authorities, experts, and institutions related to the scope of the project. Furthermore, the Core Team will&#13;
forward, in whatever way it deems appropriate, the comments of the sub-working groups that will be set up by the GoG in relation with the&#13;
implementation of the project. The Core Team will be comprised of personnel from the General Secretariat of Industry of the Ministry of&#13;
Economy, Growth, and Tourism.&#13;
' If Bank concludes that all the licenses that could effectively be reformed within the priority sectors selected by the GoG have been&#13;
reviewed and resources for licensing review remain, it will suggest a list of additional activities/sectors to be reviewed for joint agreement&#13;
with the Commission/SRSS and GoG. These will be selected based on criteria such as: Relevance to the Greek economy, e.g. high share of&#13;
GDP and/or employment; Potential for growth (in particular for increases in exports, employment, investment) based on underlying&#13;
6VS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿each regulatory area, what the risk level is and which regulatory instrument(s) is/are appropriate (no&#13;
additional regulation, General Operating Conditions, mandatory standards and third-party certification,&#13;
or ex-ante license). The decision memos will also include references to one or more relevant EU or&#13;
OECD examples that show how the proposed solution is in line with good practice. (This is expected&#13;
to draw primarily on the overview prepared under Component A). The decision memos will include&#13;
specific references to the legal text in need of revision, and what type of revisions are recommended.&#13;
The preparation of the decision memos may be done, when applicable, in the framework of the&#13;
relevant working groups, and/or incorporate the results of discussions held in these working group.&#13;
C.3. The Bank in consultations with the Core Team (or its successor) will summarize the decision&#13;
memos into a short report with the list of all activities in select priority sectors to be covered by ex&#13;
ante licenses, mandatory standards and third-party certification, General Operating Conditions (and&#13;
the regulatory areas covered by these instruments) - and the list of economic activities (and the&#13;
regulatory areas for each of them) for which existing licenses could be cancelled and no additional&#13;
regulation imposed.&#13;
C.4. The Bank will review the relevant draft Presidential Decrees and (Joint) Ministerial&#13;
Decisions prepared by the legal experts of the Government of Greece to review whether the content&#13;
reflects the recommendations made in the Decisions Memos.&#13;
Component D. Development of technical requirements4&#13;
D. I. The Bank will prepare a list of economic activities for which the results of the licensing review&#13;
indicate that a revision of the underlying mandatory technical requirements5 is required. The list&#13;
may be updated from time to time based on the progress of the licensing review. From this list, the&#13;
Core Team, Commission/SRSS, and Bank will consult on the selection of a limited number of priority&#13;
activities/sectors (based on their economic relevance) for which mandatory technical requirements&#13;
require revision (through whichever adequate legal instrument), without which the beneficial impact of&#13;
the licensing reform may not be (fully or partly) achieved. The Bank will also prepare short&#13;
guidelines for the said revision of mandatory technical requirements.&#13;
D.2. The Bank will prepare inputs to draft technical requirements (using whichever legal instrument&#13;
has been identified as appropriate) for selected activities identified under Component D.1. This is&#13;
expected to include elaboration of new technical requirements for only (at most) a small number of&#13;
competitive advantage; Available evidence suggesting that these activities/sectors are strongly/significantly hampered by the existing&#13;
licensing regime (e.g. number of types of licenses affecting these activities); and Licensing volumes (number of licenses issued per year for a&#13;
given sector/activity).&#13;
4&#13;
The IL Law and reform process foresee the move from an essentially ex ante regulatory regime to one that relies significantly more on ex&#13;
post processes. This requires not only adequate attention to capacity and structures for supervision, inspections and enforcement, but also in&#13;
some cases may require the development of new mandatory technical requirements, or changes to existing ones. This could be in areas where&#13;
a) licensing has hitherto been the main regulatory basis, b) said licensing is proposed for elimination, c) existing technical requirements are&#13;
found to be wanting, and d) as a result a regulatory gap may appear leaving significant risks insufficiently regulated. It may also be in cases&#13;
where, regardless of the choice of regulatory instruments (licensing, notification, free establishment etc.), mandatory technical requirements&#13;
are excessively burdensome and/or outdated, and will thus limit business creation/growth. Depending on the specific case, addressing this&#13;
regulatory gap may be done either through: a) amendments to, or introduction of, mandatory technical requirements through primary or&#13;
secondary legislation (with the orecise instrument to be dent.fie fo t  :z&#13;
' Sector-specific legislation and norms, applicable to active establishments regardless of whether a license is needed or not - regardless of the&#13;
legal instrument used to establish these requirements.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿priority areas. The Bank will support the dedicated body to be set up by the Government of Greece for&#13;
the specific purpose of drafting such mandatory technical requirements.&#13;
Component E: Development of monitoring and evaluation framework and survey&#13;
E. 1. The Bank will conduct a stock-taking of existing data and develop a high-level M&amp;E framework&#13;
for the reform including overall goals and objectives, implementation check-list, outcome indicators&#13;
and data sources to be used.&#13;
E.2. Subject to the findings of E. 1., the Bank, in consultation with the SRSS/Commission and GoG,&#13;
will determine whether a survey is necessary. In case it is found not to be necessary, then the intended&#13;
resources will be reallocated to other components, e.g. allowing for additional licensing reviews or&#13;
development of technical requirements. If the survey is determined to be necessary, the Bank will&#13;
prepare a baseline survey questionnaire to measure the time and costs associated with licensing&#13;
incurred by businesses. The survey is expected to cover both the administrative burden posed by&#13;
licensing, and the quality of interactions between businesses and licensing and enforcement&#13;
authorities.&#13;
E.3 Subject to the decision to undertake a survey in E.2, the Bank will survey firms using the&#13;
questionnaire developed in E.2. The output will be submission of data tables, data sets and technical&#13;
report. The data are expected to help better identify the key issues for improvement, make the case for&#13;
reform more effectively, and provide a model for future follow-up surveys (which are outside the&#13;
scope of this Agreement) to track improvements and the impact of the reforms.&#13;
Component F: Design and requirements specifications for an integrated licensing and&#13;
inspections platform&#13;
F.1. The Bank will carry out a capacity and needs assessment in order to inform the selection of a&#13;
software platform to address both licensing and inspection requirements. The assessment will cover:&#13;
(i) governance and institutional arrangements for the operation of an integrated system; (ii) sustainable&#13;
and secure hosting environments (including aspects of business continuity and disaster recovery); (iii)&#13;
platform alternatives including underlying technologies and data exchange architectures; (iv) capacity&#13;
building requirements to support a critical platform; and (v) communication strategies to increase e-&#13;
services utilization. The assessment will also include a review of relevant ongoing initiatives and&#13;
projects in the field of e-govemment/e-governance to ensure that they are fully taken into account in&#13;
design and requirements specifications to be developed, and that these are fully in line with these&#13;
initiatives and broader strategy of the GoG in this area.&#13;
F.2. The Bank will develop the high level design and requirements specifications for the procurement&#13;
of an IT system in line with Article 3 and Chapter G of the IL Law. This system shall cover both the&#13;
licensing process (e-licensing: application, back-office, issuance) and subsequent inspections/&#13;
enforcement (database of establishments supervised, risk profiles, planning of inspections, recording&#13;
of results and reports etc.).&#13;
Component G: Analysis and review of other implementation requirements for IL Law -&#13;
development of summary recommendations&#13;
G. 1. The Bank will support the Government of Greece's preparation of a draft enforcement framework&#13;
taking into account international best practice, and specific Greek case law (jurisprudence). The advice&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿provided by the Bank will be informed by and take into account any other initiatives and projects&#13;
ongoing in the area of enforcement and sanctions.&#13;
G.2. The Bank will prepare a short report to serve as summary of analysis and recommendations&#13;
covering the following:&#13;
*  Legal foundation, needs, international experience and proposed strategic vision and high-level&#13;
priority areas for reform of supervision and inspections (drawing on the OECD Principles on&#13;
Regulatory Enforcement and Inspections, recently published)&#13;
*  Required changes in internal organization, workflow, processes, job descriptions and staffing&#13;
of license-issuing bodies as a consequence of the licensing reform including its IT component,&#13;
including issues relating to transition of personnel to new functions and roles&#13;
*  Additional changes that may be required in the legal framework e.g. relating to enforcement,&#13;
liability (in particular to ensure full implementation of principles and provisions of Article 30)&#13;
G.3. To support the move from a primarily ex ante regulatory approach to a risk-based ex post one, the&#13;
Bank will prepare a draft targeting methodology based on risk analysis and risk management for one&#13;
or more types of business inspections.&#13;
G.4. In line with Chapter C (Certification) of the IL Law and considering the experience of the EU&#13;
Single Market regulatory framework and practices for product markets regulation, the Bank will&#13;
prepare high-level recommendations on the needs, opportunities and challenges pertaining to the use&#13;
of third-party conformity assessment as one of the regulatory instruments for economic activities. In&#13;
case work on revising the IL Law leads to substantial changes in this chapter of the IL Law, this&#13;
activity may become unnecessary, as the input would have been provided already as part of&#13;
Component B.2.&#13;
The support will focus on determining:&#13;
*  Which regulatory requirements and supervisory processes are needed to ensure that the third-&#13;
party conformity assessment system can work adequately? For instance, conformity&#13;
assessment providers could be subject to adequate mandatory insurance requirements for&#13;
potential liability claims, and to clear and sufficient liability rules in case they fail in their role&#13;
and/or incidents happen in spite of their certification.&#13;
*  Which institutions will be required, with which functions and an indication of which&#13;
resources?&#13;
*  For which economic activities and regulatory areas would this instrument be appropriate?&#13;
*  Other considerations necessary for proper functioning of a third-party conformity assessment&#13;
system.&#13;

Activities will rely on the following inputs, which will be either fully or partially available when work&#13;
starts:&#13;

Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the&#13;
Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section,&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX 3&#13;
GOVERNANCE OF THE ACTIVITIES&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements&#13;
between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
GOVERNANCE FOR THE ACTIVITIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 2 OF ANNEX 1 TO&#13;
THIS ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Working Modalities&#13;
The Bank will be in charge of the implementation of the activities and shall consult with the Structural&#13;
Reform Support Service (SRSS) regularly.&#13;
SRSS will take all appropriate measures to facilitate the Bank work in the performance of the&#13;
activities, including facilitating contacts with Greek authorities and facilitating the creation of an inter-&#13;
ministerial coordination mechanism.&#13;
The activities will be undertaken in close collaboration with the SRSS, and the Greek correspondent&#13;
(the Secretary General for Industry) from the Ministry of Economy, Growth, and Tourism (MoEGT,&#13;
or its successor).&#13;
In order to facilitate the implementation of the project, the SRSS will be responsible for involving&#13;
other EU Commission services, where appropriate. SRSS will also provide support to ensuring the&#13;
appropriate involvement of the Government of Greece for the smooth execution of the activities by the&#13;
Bank. The SRSS will provide the Bank with relevant documents, reports and findings, resulting from&#13;
other technical assistance work streams the SRSS is or has been involved in. It will also inform the&#13;
Bank team of relevant developments under the economic adjustment programme and consult with the&#13;
Bank when contracting consultants who may contribute to the investment licensing reforms.&#13;
The Bank shall report to the Commission on the implementation of the Action in accordance with the&#13;
Framework Agreement. In particular, the Bank will deliver quarterly progress reports in accordance&#13;
with Article 5.3 of the Framework Agreement.&#13;
The Bank and SRSS will have regular exchanges on the progress of the project, on the work plan or&#13;
schedule of project activities for the following month(s) including missions, and raise any issues as&#13;
they arise concerning difficulties encountered. A Representative of the SRSS will be invited to attend&#13;
all pertinent events or activities.&#13;
Priorities and choices to be made in the planning of the activities will be discussed and consulted&#13;
between the Bank and SRSS. To facilitate the organization and efficiency of missions the Bank will&#13;
share with the SRSS in a timely manner the relevant documents.&#13;
Itis expected that the Secretary General for Industry of the MoEGT (or its successor) will be the&#13;
national contact point for the activities, in collaboration with the Secretariat General for Coordination,&#13;
and will coordinate the necessary inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms and will maintain a&#13;
15&#13;
r7"A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Project Management Team, composed of senior government officials and with support from the Prime&#13;
Minister's Office in order to ensure ownership of the process and guide the continued reform.&#13;
It is expected that the Bank will work with the Core Team (or its successor) responsible for the&#13;
screening and analysing of existing licensing regulation and the provision of specific&#13;
recommendations for revisions of current licensing regulation. It is expected that the MoEGT will&#13;
provide input for the analysis of the Bank; comments on the work plan of the project; review draft&#13;
outputs and comment on relevance of policy recommendations developed by the Bank. It is expected&#13;
that the Bank will consult and cooperate with the Project Management Team at all major stages of the&#13;
activities to be implemented.&#13;
It is expected that the Bank will work with any working group(s) that may be established as per&#13;
Council of Ministers Act No. 21. The Bank may also work with other operational ad-hoc working&#13;
group(s) of the Greek administration (including central and local authorities), if this proves necessary.&#13;
The continued involvement of private sector stakeholders as well as relevant ministries and agencies is&#13;
considered essential for the reform to be adequately designed and successfully implemented. It is&#13;
expected that the Bank will discuss, where appropriate with Greek stakeholders, businesses, and&#13;
business associations active in the selected sectors.&#13;
Bank team composition:&#13;
The Bank shall, in its sole discretion, determine the composition of the staff (including staff holding&#13;
consultant appointments) assigned to perform the activities under this Agreement. The Bank team will&#13;
be managed by a Bank Task Team Leader with at least 10 years of relevant experience, drawing on the&#13;
expertise of the World Bank Group staff including personnel and consultants/ experts contributing to&#13;
specific segments of the activities in, among others, the following areas: economy; business licensing;&#13;
business processes; law; IT; and design and implementation of institutional and e-governance reform,&#13;
including interpretation and translation services. A local project coordinator will facilitate and support&#13;
the activities to be implemented under Annex 1 to this Agreement. The Bank team will include the&#13;
following competencies:&#13;
-  Ability to analyse regulatory systems for business licensing, notably in the EU.&#13;
-  Ability to translate analysis into recommendations for regulatory and legislative changes&#13;
related to business licensing, particularly taking into account the local institutional setting and&#13;
socio-economic environment.&#13;
-  Capacity to develop requirements for IT systems.&#13;
-  Project management, economic, and other skills that will be considered necessary for the&#13;
execution of the activities.&#13;
