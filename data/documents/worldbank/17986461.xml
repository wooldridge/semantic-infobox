[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Lester, letâ&#128;&#153;s start today by -- Iâ&#128;&#153;ll ask you to give a description of your&#13;
family background, birth, education, experience up to the point that you joined the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Okay. I was born on December 2nd, 1914. I lived first in Brooklyn, Queens,&#13;
moved to Manhattan. My family -- my father was a small businessman, but he went&#13;
bankrupt and lost his business. That meant for a while we were quite poor.&#13;
&#13;
I went to-- Iâ&#128;&#153;ll start with high school. I went to public school in New York City, and then&#13;
I went to a high school called Townsend Harris Hall, which was then the selective high&#13;
school in New York. You had to take an examination to get in, which I took, and I was&#13;
good on the examination, so I got in. It was sort of a preparatory school to City College.&#13;
I was young. I was fifteen when I started college. I was twelve when I got into high&#13;
school. [I] went there for three years, then I went to college. At City College I was&#13;
involved in political affairs, also in the running of the college newspaper, which got me&#13;
into some trouble, which, if youâ&#128;&#153;re interested, I can tell you about that as well.&#13;
&#13;
Let me talk about that for a minute because that affected my life in a way. The college&#13;
had a newspaper called The Campus, and I joined the staff of The Campus as a writer&#13;
shortly after I started college. I was a little boy. I was still in knee pants. On April 1st&#13;
of each year the paper published an issue called The Crampus, which was supposed to be&#13;
a funny issue. For one issue, I became sort of the lead editor for that particular issue. I&#13;
wrote a piece lampooning the chief of the military science unit, which was in not great&#13;
favor with the City College boys. We were all supposed to be City College, New York&#13;
City radical Jews. We were certainly Jews, but it was a place which had a reputation of&#13;
harboring a lot of young communists. There were some very important ones, but mostly&#13;
they were New Deal Democrats, like I was.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, we wrote this issue and we were brought up -- the ones who were responsible&#13;
for the issue were brought up on charges before the Board of Higher Education of New&#13;
York. Bad boys, we did bad -- we wrote bad things, pornographic stuff. Ridiculous.&#13;
Even then it was pretty silly. But I was the chief editor for that particular issue, and so&#13;
the whole process ended up with my getting censured by the Board of Higher Education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Several guys got expelled. I did not get expelled because the president of the college â&#128;&#147;&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#153;s another story -- Frederick Robinson, president of the college, I gather, told the&#13;
Board of Higher Education that I was a good boy but I had got into bad company. I was&#13;
all of about sixteen years old, I think, at the time, something like that. [Laughter]. Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
not sure.&#13;
&#13;
The only relevance of that now is that when I applied to law school, I applied -- I had no&#13;
money. I had to work. So I applied to Brooklyn Law School to go at night. That was&#13;
like a little factory. They never turned anybody down, but they turned me down because&#13;
on my record there was â&#128;&#156;censured by the Board of Higher Education.â&#128;? I knew somebody&#13;
who was involved in the admissions process at Brooklyn Law School. They changed&#13;
their mind, so they admitted me, and that was that.&#13;
&#13;
The funny thing about my experience at City College, this newspaper, was that I was&#13;
given as an assignment the president of the college, Dr. Robinson. Robinson was not only&#13;
the president of the college but was a columnist for the [William Randolph] Hearst&#13;
newspapers. If you know anything about Hearst in those days, he was the bad boy as far&#13;
as the liberals were concerned, the Democrats. He was a far right-winger and we didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
like anything about Hearst.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And you as a New Deal-leaning Democrat were assigned to cover him.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I was assigned to cover the president of the college -- thatâ&#128;&#153;s right -- which I&#13;
did. I got along with him fine, but we were always a little wary of each other. The funny&#13;
thing that happened was when I went up to Van Cortland Park to play golf -- that was a&#13;
public golf course -- I ran into two young men and we set up a foursome. I was with a&#13;
friend of mine.&#13;
&#13;
I forgot to mention that in the college one day all of us found in our little alcoves a&#13;
written statement which purported to be a copy of an article written in a particular paper&#13;
which none of us had ever heard of, extolling the virtues of the president, Dr. Robinson,&#13;
what a great man Dr. Robinson was.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, getting back to the golf course. I ran into these two guys. We played golf&#13;
together and we talked about what we did. These two guys said they were involved in&#13;
this newspaper which I remember reading about, the one that was supposed to have&#13;
published the article about Robinson. So I asked about it. I said, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;m on the City&#13;
College newspaper. I was interested in that thing that came around.â&#128;? They both started&#13;
to laugh. They said, â&#128;&#156;Thatâ&#128;&#153;s not really a newspaper. All we do is publish these reviews&#13;
about people, which never get published, but we sell the reviews to people because they&#13;
want to hear good things about themselves.â&#128;? For me, that was a bonanza.&#13;
&#13;
When I got back to college the next morning, I went in to see Robinson. I told him I met&#13;
these two guys and they told me it was not really a newspaper. The whole thing was just&#13;
a business matter. I remember he got very upset. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t know about this. He threw&#13;
me out of his office. He said, â&#128;&#156;Never come back here again.â&#128;? I wrote a piece about this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
for the college newspaper, just explaining what Iâ&#128;&#153;ve just told you. The thing was taken&#13;
up in The New York Times. There was a big article about it in The New York Times.&#13;
[Laughter]. So Robinson was not very happy about all this. In spite of all that, he did not&#13;
get me expelled from City College, which he could have. Anyway, that was it.&#13;
[Interruption].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Now you can start again.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I went to law school. As I said, I went to law school at night. We had no&#13;
money and I worked during the day. It was work. Iâ&#128;&#153;d never worked so hard. When I got&#13;
out of law school, I went to work for a law firm. It was a big insurance firm, but I&#13;
worked for a partner who handled what was called stockholdersâ&#128;&#153; lawsuits in those days,&#13;
strike suits, which interested me a lot. I learned about corporate shenanigans in those&#13;
days. I got out of law school when I was twenty-two years old. I had grown up, I guess,&#13;
by that time. I worked for that firm a couple of years. I wrote an article, as a matter of&#13;
fact, that was published in The Nation about the social usefulness of stockholdersâ&#128;&#153; suits.&#13;
In those days, people didnâ&#128;&#153;t know anything about stockholdersâ&#128;&#153; suits. Nowadays, of&#13;
course, itâ&#128;&#153;s very common, but not in those days.&#13;
&#13;
Mostly because of that kind of work I did in this law firm, I managed to get a job at the&#13;
Securities and Exchange Commission, which really interested me. I got involved in doing&#13;
SEC work. I worked at the SEC for several years, about three years, I think. I ended up&#13;
in Philadelphia right after the war. The SEC moved from Washington to Philadelphia&#13;
and I moved with them to Philadelphia.&#13;
&#13;
Then I got drafted. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a story about my life, too, because in those days everybody got&#13;
drafted unless there was -- depending upon their age and their marital status and their&#13;
children. I got drafted. In those days you took two tests when you got drafted for the&#13;
army to decide where to put you. One was a regular IQ test, and the other was what they&#13;
called a technical aptitude test, which was also a kind of IQ test. Again, a little&#13;
background, I was a real schlemiel on technical stuff. I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t even drive a car. We&#13;
had no car. And I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know anything about mechanical stuff around the house. But&#13;
my wife -- I married -- she was the daughter of an engineer, and she was the technician,&#13;
so she fixed everything in the house. She knew all about that kind of thing, and I knew&#13;
nothing.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, I took these tests and gave them back to the army. I came to get assigned, pack&#13;
my bags to go somewhere. The officer in charge of assignments had my file. I walked in&#13;
and he said, â&#128;&#156;Soldier, I want to tell you, you have gotten the highest mark in the army on&#13;
both these two tests. Because of that, we are going to send you to a place in the army that&#13;
needsâ&#128;? -- I still remember the word â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#156;leavening, the tank corps.â&#128;? [Laughter]. So I said&#13;
thank you and I came back home to pack my bags and I told my wife this story. I still&#13;
remember she was sitting at her desk. She put her head in her hands. She said, â&#128;&#156;Oh, my&#13;
God. For the first time I feel for the fate of this country.â&#128;? [Laughter].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When I went into the tank corps I must have been the only man in the whole army who&#13;
drove a tank but couldnâ&#128;&#153;t drive an automobile. I learned to drive a tank and I became&#13;
very proficient at it. I became the star tank man in my company. And the same with the&#13;
rifle. I had never even touched a rifle before, but I had good eyes, so I became a good&#13;
rifle shooter.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, it came time for my company to go to Europe. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know this, but they were&#13;
mobilized to take part in the invasion of Germany. And I was about to go, though, when&#13;
my company commander kept me from going. He said, â&#128;&#156;Youâ&#128;&#153;re too valuable as a&#13;
teacher.â&#128;? So I stayed behind on the cadre at Fort Knox, Kentucky, teaching others how to&#13;
drive tanks. While I was at Fort Knox, Kentucky, I applied to go to OCS, Officer&#13;
Candidate School.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So you went in at enlisted rank.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I was enlisted, yes. I went into -- and then I applied for admission to OCS&#13;
both in the tank corps and in the judge advocate generalâ&#128;&#153;s department. The army, in its&#13;
wisdom -- they interviewed me -- admitted me to the JAG OCS, which I went to. I left&#13;
the JAG OCS as a first lieutenant. In my army career I started out working here in&#13;
Washington for a while. Then I went to Germany to work on some court martial trials in&#13;
Germany. I was there for a while.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is before the end of the war.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Before the end of the war. The war was over in Germany then, but it was&#13;
still going on in Japan. It was just over in Germany. Anyway, I stayed in Germany,&#13;
court-martialing people and then came back to the United States and joined the&#13;
international law branch. This really determined the course of my life. I joined the&#13;
international law branch and I became after a while the chief of the international law&#13;
branch. The international law branch -- it used to be the war plans division. Essentially&#13;
we were lawyers for the general staff. So I got very much involved in the legal problems&#13;
of the general staff. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re relevant now because they were problems which the army&#13;
has to consider right now having to deal with what is the distinction between combatants&#13;
and non-combatants, how do you treat prisoners of war, what rights are they entitled to,&#13;
what can you keep secret, what canâ&#128;&#153;t you keep secret. I used to work on that and then&#13;
published articles about those matters in the law journals.&#13;
&#13;
One of the most interesting things about all this was that there was one big matter, a&#13;
highly classified matter that I got involved in. I was not then the chief of the unit, but my&#13;
boss was Colonel Archibald King. He was an old, regular army officer, a very fine&#13;
gentleman. [He] assigned me to it. I had to get special clearance. I still remember when&#13;
I went up for special clearance from -- it was then the OSS [Office of Strategic Services],&#13;
which is the predecessor to the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] -- they interviewed&#13;
me, and the guy in charge, who was second in command of the OSS, had my&#13;
background. He said, â&#128;&#156;Oh.â&#128;? He saw I went to City College. â&#128;&#156;City College boy? One of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Eleanor Rooseveltâ&#128;&#153;s communist Jewish friends, right?â&#128;? [Laughter]. [unclear]&#13;
disgusting. [Laughter].&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, he interviewed me and he thought I was a pretty good fellow, so I got cleared. I&#13;
got a special clearance, top secret -- ultra, it was called, ultra, in those days, secret&#13;
clearance, which I got. I still remember I worked on this for a long time, a very secret&#13;
matter.&#13;
&#13;
At one time at the very end of it, we worked on the report, which we gave to the general&#13;
staff, which required clearance of some matter with the Justice Department. So I went to&#13;
the office of the Attorney General. I remember there were a whole bunch of generals and&#13;
admirals -- I was a captain by that time -- sitting outside the office of the Attorney&#13;
General. We were admitted in, all went in in order of rank, and I was the lowest-ranking&#13;
person there so I was the last person in. We met with the attorney general, Tom Clark,&#13;
and J. Edgar Hoover was there. So we explained what this was all about.&#13;
&#13;
Everybody there was a military man except the attorney general, Tom Clark, and&#13;
Hoover. While we were having the meeting, a civilian walked in. Everybody there knew&#13;
the civilian except me. They all called him, â&#128;&#156;Hi, Jack.â&#128;? After a while, we were talking&#13;
about the position of the War Department and the army about certain matters. He said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;The armyâ&#128;&#153;s position on X is as follows,â&#128;? and he described what the armyâ&#128;&#153;s position&#13;
was. As he described it, I interrupted him. I said, â&#128;&#156;No.â&#128;? I hadnâ&#128;&#153;t met the man. I said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;No, thatâ&#128;&#153;s not the armyâ&#128;&#153;s position. The armyâ&#128;&#153;s position is Y.â&#128;? Nobody said anything.&#13;
At the end of the meeting, my general was there, the judge advocate general. He said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Captain, I think I ought to introduce you to the Assistant Secretary of War, John&#13;
McCloy.â&#128;? [Laughter]. I still think McCloy was wrong.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, this is all relevant in a way, because McCloy was my boss at the World Bank.&#13;
He became the second president of the Bank after Eugene Meyer. Iâ&#128;&#153;m now up to the&#13;
Bank. One of the reasons why this is all interesting, in a way, for me professionally, was&#13;
that this kind of background between the SEC and my work as an international lawyer for&#13;
the army really was responsible for my getting a job at the World Bank. Should I talk&#13;
about that now?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes. When did you join the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I joined the World Bank after I got out of the army. To get to join the World&#13;
Bank was an interesting problem. Do you want to hear about that?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It was in formation. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s all I know. Tell me.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, let me tell you about the World Bank. When I got out of the army, was&#13;
getting out of the army, in 1946, I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know quite what to do with myself. I could&#13;
have gone back to the SEC, which I really liked a lot, but I had heard about the World&#13;
Bank, which was just being started. I liked the idea of the World Bank. So a friend of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
mine introduced me to somebody who was in the World Bank then as assistant to the&#13;
president. Richard [H.] Demuth his name was.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a name I recognize.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I went to see him, and he talked to me. He then arranged for me to see&#13;
Chester McLain. Now Chester McLain was the first general counsel of the Bank. He&#13;
had been a partner in the law firm of Cravath, Swaine and Moore in New York. McCloy&#13;
had been a partner in the same law firm. McCloy succeeded Eugene Meyer as president.&#13;
The reason thatâ&#128;&#153;s relevant is that the two of them really, Cravath, ran the Bank for a&#13;
while. If you read the oral histories youâ&#128;&#153;ll see that some of the old timers used to talk&#13;
about McLain as being the person responsible for keeping the Bank together properly.&#13;
He was -- do you know anything about Cravath, incidentally, the law firm?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know anything about the law firm.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It probably was then -- may still be -- the premier law firm in the country.&#13;
The thing for me was I knew about Cravath from my work at the SEC. For me, that was&#13;
so interesting. I knew perfectly well the kind of firm it was. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t want Jews.&#13;
They didnâ&#128;&#153;t want women. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t want blacks. They may have had one Jewish&#13;
partner, Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure. Anyway, McLain interviewed me. In spite of himself, I think, he&#13;
liked me because of the background I had. I had a very useful background for the World&#13;
Bank. I kept on being interviewed. He kept on calling me back for interviews. I think I&#13;
had about three or four interviews with him, but I knew perfectly well what was on his&#13;
mind. He was worried about me.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, at the last meeting, third or fourth interview, he said, â&#128;&#156;Donâ&#128;&#153;t you know anybody&#13;
from Cravath?â&#128;? It just so happens that in this work I mentioned before that I worked on&#13;
when I was in the army, this super secret matter, one of the people on the general staff&#13;
was a general who had been from Cravath also. I said, â&#128;&#156;Well, I know General So-and-&#13;
so.â&#128;? I know that he liked what I had done, because I was the chief architect of that&#13;
matter. So he must have called the guy, because the next day he called me up. He said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Captain, okay, youâ&#128;&#153;re hired. Come in, I want to talk to you. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you about your&#13;
work.?&#13;
&#13;
So I came in and he told me what my salary would be, what Iâ&#128;&#153;d be doing. Then when he&#13;
got finished he said, â&#128;&#156;Captain, I want to tell you something. Not only have I never hired&#13;
anybody like you, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve never even talked to anybody like you.â&#128;? [Laughter].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And he meant --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t know anybody like me before. Once he hired me, I was&#13;
fine. I was one of the boys. I think the first thing he asked me to do was to take a look at&#13;
the rules of procedure for the first annual meeting for the directors of the governors, the&#13;
rules of procedure for the meetings. Well, I had never seen any of these things in my&#13;
life. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know anything about those matters, by-laws and rules of procedure. But I&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
looked at them. I had no comments of substance, but I did have some comments about&#13;
punctuation and spelling and grammar, as I remember.&#13;
&#13;
That was the best kind of comment I could have given him, because he was very&#13;
fastidious about things just like that, about grammar, about spelling. Once he realized he&#13;
had made a mistake in grammar and I corrected it, I was fine. After that he was very nice&#13;
to me. He gave me very good assignments, which I got throughout his tenure at the&#13;
Bank. I was very lucky. I worked on all sorts of very interesting things from the very&#13;
beginning. Anyway, I was there at the first annual meeting, and that was it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I want to interrupt just for two quick questions. One is, did anybody in&#13;
these interviews bring up your radical past with The Crampus, or did that never come up&#13;
again?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: [Laughter]. No.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It never resurfaced?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: No. They knew all about it but they didnâ&#128;&#153;t talk about it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And the other is, as you were interviewing for the Bank, how aware&#13;
were you of the background negotiations that had been going on, the discussions about&#13;
the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I had no knowledge of that at all, but I did learn about it when I was there.&#13;
One of the first things I learned about was the fuss there was in the days of Meyer about&#13;
the role of the United States and the United States? executive director in the handling of&#13;
the Bank. [Tape interruption].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got a quick chronological question for you. You mentioned that&#13;
you were conscious of Eugene Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s presidency, but you must have come in right&#13;
about the transition then.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: No. When I came in he was president.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: He was still president.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: He was president. After McLain interviewed me and decided to hire me, he&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;I have to clear this with Eugene Meyer.â&#128;? So he brought me in to see Eugene&#13;
Meyer, and Meyer had been a businessman in New York. His lawyers, his Firmâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
lawyers, were Cravath. This is why, I guess, Chester McLain and McCloy were there.&#13;
They were Cravath lawyers, and Meyer was the first president. He wasnâ&#128;&#153;t president very&#13;
long, but he was president when I was hired. As I say, I met him. He had to pass on me,&#13;
which he did. He talked; I never said anything. But he said, â&#128;&#156;Okay, youâ&#128;&#153;re hired.â&#128;? That&#13;
was it. I had very little to do with him. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t last very long.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No. He was only there several months.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. He left, and then John McCloy became president, and that was&#13;
it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You had started to talk about the lawyers who came in about that time&#13;
under McLain.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, Chester McLain came in as general counsel. At that time, the acting&#13;
general counsel was a man named Ansel Luxford. Luxford had been the chief lawyer for&#13;
the United States at Bretton Woods, so he knew about the Bank. But McLain -- Luxford&#13;
was a good old New Deal liberal and a Democrat. He and McLain didnâ&#128;&#153;t really get along&#13;
very well. McLain was general counsel and he was then, I guess, associate general&#13;
counsel. But he finally left after a while.&#13;
&#13;
McLain had hired, except for me -- oh, he also hired a woman later. He hired people&#13;
very much in the Cravath mold -- all guys who had been the Harvard-Yale-Columbia law&#13;
review types. He hired as a deputy, Davidson Sommers, who later became general&#13;
counsel. He was a partner in one of the New York law firms, and he came down. As a&#13;
matter of fact, he had been McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s chief of staff during the war, a colonel or lieutenant&#13;
colonel during the war. Anyway, there was Ellsworth Clark, who was at law school with&#13;
Sommers, from the Harvard Law Review; Lars Bengston, another one very much in the&#13;
Cravath mold. A woman, which was unusual for McLain to hire but did, Virginia&#13;
Morsey. She married the chief engineer of the Bank, [Lieutenant] General [Raymond A.]&#13;
Wheeler, a very important fellow in affairs of the Bank. Letâ&#128;&#153;s see who else. There was a&#13;
whole pile of them.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: How many people were in the legal department at that time?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Iâ&#128;&#153;m trying to remember. In those days, the early days when I was there, there&#13;
were probably about eight, ten lawyers. That was it. McLain hired a Frenchman,&#13;
Georges Delaume, and he hired a Cuban, Leopoldo Cancio. He hired an Englishman,&#13;
[Reginald B. J.] Dick Richards, who came from one of the big firms in London. Richards&#13;
became general counsel of IFC [International Finance Corporation] later. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you&#13;
about that, too. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s another interesting story. As I say, Lars Bengston. Dick Bateson,&#13;
also from Harvard Law School. These guys had mostly been law clerks or with one or&#13;
the other big law firms after they got out of law school. We got along fine. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re a&#13;
very good bunch of people.&#13;
&#13;
One of the interesting things about the Bank in those days [is] it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t specialized.&#13;
There werenâ&#128;&#153;t enough people to specialize much. And McLain wanted us to get involved&#13;
in everything. A lawyer wasnâ&#128;&#153;t supposed to do just one thing; he had to do everything&#13;
that McLain wanted him to do. So the result of that was that you learned a lot of things,&#13;
as I did. I was very lucky, I thought. So I got involved not only in the normal work of a&#13;
lawyer in the lending and the borrowing and the administration of the place â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;ll get to&#13;
talk about some of those things a little later; theyâ&#128;&#153;re all very interesting -- but the people&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Lester Nurick&#13;
                                         Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank learned that the Bank was not supposed to be political and they were&#13;
supposed to be completely objective in their analysis and conclusions.&#13;
&#13;
That was very interesting, because you had people like Eugene Black and McCloy and&#13;
Robert Garner. [They] all came from Wall Street, but they did not become just American&#13;
citizens working in the Bank. They were international civil servants, and they took that&#13;
very seriously. Their decisions were based on what they regarded as economic, financial,&#13;
legal considerations. That was not easy, because the US -- particularly the US, which&#13;
was the predominant country at the time -- tried to put pressure on the Bank every once in&#13;
a while to do something. And the Bank, if it wanted to, it did it; if it didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to, it&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t do it.&#13;
&#13;
One of the things they did -- and this was largely the result of General Wheeler -- was to&#13;
insist on competitive bidding in connection with contracting. That meant you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
give contracts to favorite people. You had to go through a process normally of&#13;
international competitive bidding. That was a big deal.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You had started to talk about the work you did on the first meeting on&#13;
the procedures and regulations. How did that proceed after you made the grammatical&#13;
corrections? Did you continue --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The meeting itself was fine. It was no big deal or problem at all. They agreed&#13;
to a number of basic things to get the thing started. It was fine. The Bank got started&#13;
doing its work.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Then the issue -- McCloy came in, at least in my reading, concerned&#13;
about the relationship between the president of the bank and the executive directors. Is&#13;
that something you were involved in at that point?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I heard about it because -- yes. As I understand it, as I remember it -- you&#13;
probably know more about this yourself now -- at the very beginning, the US wanted to&#13;
insist on -- the American director was interested in becoming president. [Emilio G.&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Peteâ&#128;?] Collado, I think his name was. There was a -- there was opposition to that, the&#13;
idea that there should be automatically the US director ought to become president. That&#13;
was defeated. There was some kind of an informal deal when McCloy came that the&#13;
president would be responsible for the administration of the affairs of the Bank, and the&#13;
board would be responsible for matters of policy. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s easier said than done. But the&#13;
point was that the president would run the Bank, not the directors. The directors would&#13;
be involved in matters of policy and not the administration. This gets me to the incident&#13;
involving George Woods, which involved that matter and still is a problem, I gather.&#13;
Should I talk about George Woods for a moment?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Itâ&#128;&#153;s not chronological. But when George Woods became president, he was&#13;
one of the leading investment bankers in the country. He was a nasty man, I thought. He&#13;
was one of the only people in the Bank I ever disliked. But he became president.&#13;
&#13;
I remember one day -- we used to have board meetings once or twice a week -- I got a&#13;
call, I got a visit from a man named David Dunn, who was a loan officer in the Bank for&#13;
India. Woods was a friend of India and he wanted to help them. India, at that time, was&#13;
the largest debtor to the Bank. They had borrowed the most money, and they were&#13;
having trouble. Woods wanted to help them. So he prepared a statement which Dunn&#13;
told me Woods said he wanted me to read. Woods was going to make a statement to the&#13;
board at the board meeting that day, that morning. I read the statement. Woods was to&#13;
tell the board that he wanted to change the terms of payment of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s debt to the Bank,&#13;
change the amortization schedule, change the interest rate provisions -- a sweeping&#13;
change, in other words, in the obligations of India to the Bank. It had never been done&#13;
before. I read it. Woods ended by saying, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got the power to do this, but I want the&#13;
board to know about this.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I read the statement and I told Dunn, â&#128;&#156;Woods does not have the power. This is a matter&#13;
of policy for the board, not for the president.? Dunn, I could see, got a little nervous, but&#13;
he left me. About five minutes later, Woods called me. I have never been yelled at so&#13;
much in my life. He was so angry at me for giving that kind of advice. I canâ&#128;&#153;t repeat&#13;
everything he said because itâ&#128;&#153;s not very nice to talk about, but he was very angry at me.&#13;
He hung up. I thought I was going to get fired on the spot, he was so mad.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, at the board meeting, at the end of the meeting, Woods said, ?â&#128;?I have an&#13;
announcement to tell the board.â&#128;? Then he looked at me. I was sitting next to him. He&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;Counsel advises me I need your consent for the following.â&#128;? Real nasty was how he&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;Counsel advises me.â&#128;? He read the statement to the board, and at the end, when he&#13;
finished, the senior member of the board -- the board had senior members in those days --&#13;
was a man by the name of Pieter Lieftinck. Lieftinck had been the governor of the&#13;
central bank of Holland, the Netherlands, very well known, highly respected banker,&#13;
international banker. He was then an executive director of some countries, particularly&#13;
from Holland. He was from Holland. He moved to go into executive session. When you&#13;
go into executive session at the board meeting, everybody leaves except the president and&#13;
one or two people on the staff and thatâ&#128;&#153;s it.&#13;
&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what happened. Everybody on staff left except Woods and the secretary and me.&#13;
After everybody left, Lieftinck gave Woods holy hell. He said, â&#128;&#156;What do you mean by&#13;
presenting this kind of proposal to the board without any papers in advance, without any&#13;
notice? Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a terrible thing to do to us.â&#128;? After Lieftinck got finished, practically&#13;
everybody on the board echoed what he said, all furious at Woods. But the result of all&#13;
this is there were three meetings in executive session with the board. At the end of it, the&#13;
board said, â&#128;&#156;Never do anything like this again. We approve it, but donâ&#128;&#153;t you do this to us&#13;
anymore.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                            12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Later, when [Robert S.] McNamara became president -- he succeeded Woods -- and&#13;
McNamara told me about this later. He told me himself. McNamara was very good with&#13;
the board. He was very careful not to get involved in their prerogatives. He went to see&#13;
every director. He told me that every director that he spoke to talked about this particular&#13;
incident as being the reason they didnâ&#128;&#153;t like Woods. They were delighted when he left.&#13;
He wanted -- Woods, I think, wanted to get another term but couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get it because they&#13;
were all so angry at him. I gather, as you say, that this problem is still a problem with the&#13;
board, what the president can do and what the board can do.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: In my reading it seems to come up sort of cyclically. Was this late in&#13;
Woodsâ&#128;&#153; term or was it early?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: In the middle.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: In the middle, okay, because he was there something like â&#128;&#152;62 to â&#128;&#152;67 or&#13;
â&#128;&#152;68.&#13;
&#13;
NURCIK: I forget. One term.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One five-year term. Okay. Letâ&#128;&#153;s go back to the period when the legal&#13;
office is just forming, the Bank is just getting started.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, as I say, we got involved in everything. One of the first things we did&#13;
was to get very much involved in the running of the Marshall Plan, which people seem to&#13;
forget. But we made some loans to European countries in connection with the&#13;
reconstruction of Europe. The first loan we made was to France, believe it or not, a $250&#13;
million loan to France, the first one the Bank made. And $250 million in those days, that&#13;
was a lot of money. I was the lawyer on that issue and so I remember handling the legal&#13;
aspects of the issue. We wrote contracts, which are very much like normal contracts, but&#13;
with what the Bank wanted. The only big difference in the handling of that loan was the&#13;
loan was supposed to be used for what was called the Monnet Plan. That was a plan for&#13;
the reconstruction of France. The big legal issue that I recall was the negative pledge&#13;
clause-- do you know what a negative pledge clause is?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: A negative pledge clause is very common in financing agreements. It says&#13;
that if you make a loan to somebody, the person, the debtor, agrees not to pledge its&#13;
assets to secure somebody elseâ&#128;&#153;s debt in priority to your debt in order to give you parity&#13;
with anybody else on the assets of that particular debtor. We had a normal negative&#13;
pledge clause in the agreement, the draft of the agreement, which we gave the French.&#13;
That was the one provision in the agreement which they took strong exception to. They&#13;
said that would be an affront to their dignity, and they wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t sign it. Instead we made&#13;
a deal with them. We got a side letter from the French, saying they would not pledge&#13;
their assets. But it was a letter; it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t part of the agreement. I think itâ&#128;&#153;s the only time&#13;
the Bank ever made a loan without its normal negative pledge, because after that it had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Lester Nurick&#13;
                                         Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
negative pledge clauses in all of its loans. It still does. Itâ&#128;&#153;s very common. Nobody&#13;
thinks twice about it anymore except youâ&#128;&#153;ve got to interpret it once in a while, which is&#13;
the case with a lot of other issues. But that was the big deal with the French.&#13;
&#13;
Then there were some other loans made to countries in Europe ? Italy, Finland, others.&#13;
Of course, they became rich as time went on and they graduated, that is the term that was&#13;
used in the Bank. They graduated from getting loans from the Bank to lending the&#13;
money to the Bank, which is what happened. But in the early days of the Bank, as I say,&#13;
the first loans that the Bank made were mostly in connection with the reconstruction of&#13;
Europe.&#13;
&#13;
One of the things, most interesting things, then was in connection with the first bond&#13;
issue of the Bank. Do you want to hear about this? How long do you want to stay here,&#13;
incidentally?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes. Well, weâ&#128;&#153;ve got time. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll let you know when Iâ&#128;&#153;m pressed, but Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
not at this point. We can go on.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, let me talk about the first bond issue. Now, for the first bond issue, you&#13;
have to realize that in those days the Bank had no credit to speak of in Wall Street. To&#13;
the extent Wall Street knew about the Bank, they regarded the Bank as nothing but a big&#13;
charity. They would give away its money like the United Nations would or some&#13;
charitable institution and nobody would see the money again. But for the Bank to do that&#13;
would mean the Bank wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t stay in business very long, because the Bank didnâ&#128;&#153;t have&#13;
much cash. Its main asset was a call on members to make payment to the Bank for their&#13;
subscriptions. Itâ&#128;&#153;s very technical, but most of their subscriptions of countries is not paid&#13;
in at all. Some of it is paid in cash, dollars, or convertible currencies, but some not. The&#13;
rest of it is callable if the Bank needs the money.&#13;
&#13;
So the first thing the Bank had to do was to establish its credit in Wall Street. To do that,&#13;
it used the services of Morgan Stanley. It was either J. P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley. I&#13;
forget which one it was called in those days. But two senior partners of Morgan came&#13;
down to the Bank to help arrange the first bond issue. Dudley Schoales was one and&#13;
Fran[cis] Ward was another. I worked -- I was the lawyer on the first bond issue. I&#13;
worked with McLain on the handling of that issue. Anyway, they prepared a scheme for&#13;
the handling of that issue, which McLain told me about. As I studied it, I said to McLain,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;I think this is a violation of the Securities Act.â&#128;? Do you know anything about this story&#13;
at all?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t. But I can see where you were drawing on your background&#13;
in the SEC.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly. Exactly. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. I said, â&#128;&#156;This, I think, is a violation of the&#13;
Securities Act.â&#128;? In effect, he said to me, â&#128;&#156;Go away, little boy. Donâ&#128;&#153;t bother me.â&#128;? So we&#13;
worked on the issue, prepared the papers. I remember we had a final meeting to get&#13;
everything ready for the issue. Incidentally, what I didnâ&#128;&#153;t mention was that the Bank --&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
for the first issue, the arrangement was that the Bank would not have any principal&#13;
underwriter.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A; Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: For the handling of the issue there would not be any underwriters, no&#13;
principal underwriters, but dealers from all over the country, so the Bank would be&#13;
dealing with a bunch of dealers. I think there were about 1,500 or 1,600 dealers. That&#13;
was very unusual. I never knew of an issue like it before or since of any size, any&#13;
substantial size, where that occurred. Anyway, we worked on the papers. We had a final&#13;
meeting at the Downtown Athletic Club -- I still remember -- to get the thing organized,&#13;
to get started with the issue. And at the meeting we had a lunch. It was McLain and me,&#13;
and Dave Sommers was there for that meeting -- he was then deputy general counsel --&#13;
and the two guys from Morgan Stanley, Fran Ward and Dudley Schoales. They went&#13;
through all the issues dealing with this matter.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, McLain said, â&#128;&#156;The final issue is whether this is a violation of the Securities Act.&#13;
I want to get your view about all this. I will go around the table and ask you.â&#128;? So he&#13;
went around the table and everybody said it was okay except me. I said, â&#128;?No, itâ&#128;&#153;s not&#13;
okay. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a violation of the Securities Act.â&#128;? McLain said, â&#128;&#156;Okay, forget it.â&#128;? We went&#13;
ahead with the issue. There was a public statement, public announcement, made by the&#13;
Bank about the terms of the issue and that it was going to have an issue. After the&#13;
statement got issued, the chairman of the SEC called McCloy. I found out â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you&#13;
how I found out later. The chairman of the SEC called McCloy. SEC was still then in&#13;
Philadelphia. He was furious. He said, â&#128;&#156;You guys are violating the Securities Act. I&#13;
want you to come and see me at a meeting of the Commission right away.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
So the next morning, McCloy and McLain went to the SEC in Philadelphia for a meeting,&#13;
met with the Commission, the five of them. I gather that the Commission raised hell with&#13;
the Bank and said, ?If it werenâ&#128;&#153;t for the Bank, we would have had a stop order out against&#13;
you right away,? and you could imagine what would have happened if the very first bond&#13;
issue involved a stop order from the SEC, what would have happened to the future of the&#13;
Bank. God knows what. Anyway, McCloy promised never to do it again. â&#128;&#156;You guys are&#13;
acting Likeâ&#128;? -- I still remember that I was told â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#156;the Alaskan Sundown Gold Mining&#13;
Company.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
The reason I knew about this particular meeting is because a friend of mine by the name&#13;
of Louis Loss was a lawyer in the SEC at the time. He was sort of my counterpart at the&#13;
SEC, and he told me about this meeting. Loss left the SEC. He wrote a book on the&#13;
Securities Act. He became the leading academic lawyer on securities matters. He went&#13;
to Harvard Law School and he wrote this book about the Securities Act. This is the only&#13;
public record that Iâ&#128;&#153;ve ever seen about this particular incident. In that book he had a&#13;
footnote, which simply said -- in connection with the part of the Securities Act dealing&#13;
with this kind of matter, he said, â&#128;&#156;The World Bank violated this provision. They did X.?â&#128;?&#13;
It was all in a footnote. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s all it was. Nobody paid any attention to that.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Louis Loss and I still remain friends. When he was up at Harvard I used to go up and&#13;
lecture to his class. After about ten years later, he was getting out another edition of the&#13;
book. I said, â&#128;&#156;Louis, donâ&#128;&#153;t you think itâ&#128;&#153;s time you can forget about that footnote?â&#128;? He&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;All right, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll take it out.â&#128;? So he took it out. You wonâ&#128;&#153;t find it now in that book,&#13;
but if you look at early editions of his book, youâ&#128;&#153;d see that footnote. But as I say, it was&#13;
surprising to me how little attention was given to that matter. It was completely forgotten&#13;
except for the fact that it became very clear that the Bank had to deal with the SEC&#13;
properly. They couldnâ&#128;&#153;t do anything else but that.&#13;
&#13;
I remember -- getting back to the first bond issue -- and this is one of the reasons I never&#13;
wanted to talk about this before. I went with McLain to Philadelphia. The Bank was&#13;
subject to the Securities Acts in those days. I went with McLain to Philadelphia to finish&#13;
up the registration statement and pay the fee that we had to pay in order to register the&#13;
issue, which we did. We gave them a check. After we did that, McLain said, â&#128;&#156;Letâ&#128;&#153;s go&#13;
have lunch.â&#128;? So we went to have lunch at the Barclay Hotel in Philadelphia, which is&#13;
right near the SEC, and we had lunch and he had several martinis. He was a little fellow.&#13;
He was feeling pretty good.&#13;
&#13;
When we got finished having lunch, he said, â&#128;&#156;Lester, letâ&#128;&#153;s talk about this for a minute.&#13;
Remember that time we met at the Downtown Athletic Club?â&#128;? I said, â&#128;&#156;Yes.â&#128;?&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Remember I asked all you guys whether it was a violation of the Securities Act?â&#128;? I said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Yes.â&#128;? â&#128;&#156;Remember everybody said it was fine except you?â&#128;? I said, â&#128;&#156;Yes.â&#128;? He says,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Well, I knew it was a violation of the Securities Act, but it was the only way we could&#13;
sell the bond issue.â&#128;? So that was it. In other words, anything for a client.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What was the issue? Is it something you can explain?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: In those days â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;m not even sure itâ&#128;&#153;s true anymore -- you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t have an&#13;
issue without having any principal underwriter.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s the point you started with, actually. I see. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
realize that was the issue in legal terms.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: That was it. It was thought that a principal underwriter would independently&#13;
check the accuracy of the issuerâ&#128;&#153;s disclosure.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s very interesting. No, I hadnâ&#128;&#153;t heard that, your story about Louis&#13;
Loss putting it in a footnote and then eventually taking it out. Do you know when the&#13;
first edition of Lossâ&#128;&#153; book was published or about when?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, it was shortly after that, because I remember he used to spend -- I knew&#13;
him well because we were in a cooperative nursery school together. All the fathers used&#13;
to help out except him. He was working on his book.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Wait a second. I need to detach you. [Interruption]. So that first bond&#13;
issue was in 1947 apparently, summer of 1947. It was a key to establishing the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
credit and credibility.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Absolutely. It was essential for the bank to operate. It had to&#13;
borrow money in order to operate. Otherwise it would have gotten rid of its money very&#13;
quickly.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, we had several bond issues in the United States. Then we started borrowing in&#13;
other countries. The first country we went to after that to borrow was England, and I was&#13;
the lawyer on that as well. That was interesting, too, because everything was different in&#13;
those days. The British handle things in their own way. They were not like the&#13;
Americans. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t know much about securities acts. I still remember -- I dealt with&#13;
the lawyers for the underwriters in England, Freshfields. And the first meeting I had with&#13;
them the Freshfields partner said to me, â&#128;&#156;Nurick, whatâ&#128;&#153;s the oldest law firm in New York,&#13;
in the United States?â&#128;? I said, â&#128;&#156;I donâ&#128;&#153;t know. Maybe Cravath.â&#128;? â&#128;&#156;How old is it?â&#128;? I said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;A hundred years old.â&#128;? He said, â&#128;&#156;Do you know how old we are?â&#128;? I said, â&#128;&#156;No.â&#128;? He said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;ve been lawyers for the Bank of England for 400 years.â&#128;? Theyâ&#128;&#153;re still lawyers for&#13;
the Bank of England, which is why we got them in the first place, because the Bank of&#13;
England was our fiscal agent. So we dealt with Freshfields.&#13;
&#13;
We had trouble with Freshfields. I remember I did. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t want the kind of&#13;
prospectuses written for our first bond issue, the kind we had in the United States, which&#13;
had complete disclosure about material matters. They wrote their own draft, which I had&#13;
problems with. But I remember discussing it with the Freshfields partner in charge of all&#13;
this. He said, â&#128;?Nurick, if our name is on the prospectus, thatâ&#128;&#153;s all you have to worry&#13;
about.â&#128;? I said, â&#128;&#156;No, that wasnâ&#128;&#153;t good enough.â&#128;? [Laughter]. But we worked it out, and&#13;
we ended up fine. We had issues in England, and then we had issues in Canada. I&#13;
handled those as well. Then I went to Japan. We borrowed money in Japan.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I want to get some timing on this. The issue in England, as I recall from&#13;
the reading I was doing, is early â&#128;&#152;50s, 1951.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It sounds like it. My memory is lousy, but I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s about right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That one I could date. So then you went to Canada after that. That&#13;
would have been --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I think that was the third country we went to -- US, England, Canada.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And then to Japan. So this is all in the early to mid-â&#128;&#152;50s?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: In the â&#128;&#152;50s, yes, it went on. Japan was very interesting, too, all over again.&#13;
But thatâ&#128;&#153;s what we did.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What were the issues in Japan?&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, Japan, in those days, was completely ignorant of the way the West or&#13;
how the US handled matters like this. When we were there, I believe we were just about&#13;
the first foreign bond issue raised in Japan. I remember I went to Japan and we hired a&#13;
law firm. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t have any Japanese-speaking lawyers in the Bank at the time. We&#13;
got them later. We hired a law firm in which one of the partners was an American, and&#13;
we dealt with that particular law firm. Itâ&#128;&#153;s one of the big firms in Tokyo.&#13;
&#13;
I remember an issue came up, a tax issue, and the lawyer I was working with in this law&#13;
firm said, â&#128;&#156;Well, this is a tax matter. Why donâ&#128;&#153;t you write a letter to my tax partner?â&#128;? I&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;No, why donâ&#128;&#153;t you write a letter to your own tax partnerâ&#128;? Iâ&#128;&#153;m dealing with you as&#13;
the chief lawyer. â&#128;? Anyway, the result of that was we fired that law firm. We ended up&#13;
not having a law firm. What I used to do [is] I would call up the Japanese, different&#13;
people from the Ministry of Finance working on this, and the person I would talk to&#13;
would get about six people on the phone with me. Every time we had an issue, that's the&#13;
way they would do it. Consultation about everything. We finally ended up with&#13;
acceptable documents and we had a fine bond issue in Japan. And thereafter it became&#13;
no problem at all for us. But that was their introduction to the financing techniques of the&#13;
West.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Let me see if I understand this, and explain it to me if I get it wrong.&#13;
When you go outside the country, youâ&#128;&#153;re dealing with the regulations and practices in&#13;
that country, but the SEC still plays a role in this?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: SEC is involved only to the extent there is to be a jurisdictional matter&#13;
involving issues placed in the United States, sold abroad but placed here as well. So the&#13;
SEC would have some role. The SEC statutory framework and cases thereunder were&#13;
also used as evidence of good practice.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see. So your concern with the British firm Freshfields was not so&#13;
much a legal issue but an issue of clarity of the prospectus and credibility of the issue.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, those were legal issues, too. Those were legal issues, yes. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re all&#13;
essentially the same kind of problem. When you sell bonds, you want to do it properly,&#13;
and we did. In Japan, incidentally, the first time we went to Japan was not to borrow but&#13;
to lend. We loaned money to Japan, which we can talk about another time. But quite&#13;
different as time went on. They got richer and then they became -- as I said, we used the&#13;
phrase graduation. They graduated from being a borrower to being a lender. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what&#13;
happened.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Very good. I think maybe we should end this session here.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Fine.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thank you very much.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is an interview with Lester Nurick, conducted in his home in&#13;
Potomac, Maryland, on December 5th, 2003. The interviewer is Robert P. Grathwol, and&#13;
this is a part of the series of World Bank interviews. This is tape number one, side one.&#13;
&#13;
Lester, we have had just about a month between the last session and this, but weâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
spoken, and you wanted to talk today starting out about the young crew of lawyers that&#13;
began with you and some of the ones that came on while you were there still as a young&#13;
lawyer.&#13;
 NURICK: Okay. As Iâ&#128;&#153;ve said, I was hired by the general counsel, Chester McLain.&#13;
Now Chester McLain was the first general counsel. As I said, he was a senior partner in&#13;
the firm of Cravath, Swaine and Moore in New York. The Cravath firm is probably the&#13;
leading firm in the country -- very prosperous, very busy, very snooty -- and wanted to&#13;
hire, and did hire, guys who were most all from Harvard Law Review. That was about&#13;
what he wanted or people who had gone from there to be law clerks. One of the things&#13;
that was interesting about McLain [was that] he certainly liked that tradition of Cravath.&#13;
&#13;
When he came to the Bank -- and Iâ&#128;&#153;ll talk more about this later -- when he came to the&#13;
Bank, he realized that he had to be an international civil servant and he behaved&#13;
accordingly. He was very proper. He hired not only people he would have hired at&#13;
Cravath, guys from the Harvard Law Review, but others as well. Itâ&#128;&#153;s silly -- in a way it&#13;
is. He hired a guy who had been on the Yale Law Review [Franz Oppenheimer], and they&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t like the Yalies either particularly. That was quite a change for him. He also hired a&#13;
woman. Cravath had no women practically, no Jews, no foreigners. Cravath doesnâ&#128;&#153;t --&#13;
unlike all these other firms -- have foreign offices. They donâ&#128;&#153;t want to go anywhere.&#13;
Theyâ&#128;&#153;re based in New York.&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;ve worked with Cravath for years, from the early days of the Bank and also later when I&#13;
joined Wilmer, Cutler, because we had a lot to do with Cravath. Wilmer of that firm had&#13;
also been a Cravath partner.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, getting back to the early days of the World Bank, when McLain came, there&#13;
were, I think, two lawyers. Well, certainly one lawyer I knew was Ansel Luxford.&#13;
Luxford had been the chief lawyer for the United States at the Bretton Woods conference,&#13;
which inaugurated the Bank. He became the acting general counsel. Then when McLain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
came, McLain became the actual general counsel and Luxford -- maybe he was second in&#13;
command. He might have been deputy general counsel. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember. And the&#13;
other man who was there from the early days was a man by the name of Broches, Aron&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Ronnieâ&#128;? Broches. Broches was also at Bretton Woods. He was the chief lawyer for the&#13;
Dutch. As I will talk about later, Broches succeeded -- well, forget that for the moment.&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;ll talk about Broches later.&#13;
&#13;
But those two were there when I came. McLain Iâ&#128;&#153;ve talked about some already. He was&#13;
-- as a boss, he wanted the lawyers to get involved in everything. To a large extent, we&#13;
did. We were supposed to be involved in all kinds of different things. As time went on,&#13;
we got more and more involved in various operations of the Bank, a lot of which we&#13;
never knew anything about before. Broches was probably the most learned of us, most&#13;
experienced in international financial matters. He was a very accomplished linguist and&#13;
he wrote a lot and he knew about international legal matters. The rest of us hardly knew&#13;
anything about them. We learned but we didnâ&#128;&#153;t know then. He did.&#13;
&#13;
Then -- letâ&#128;&#153;s see -- Iâ&#128;&#153;ll talk about some of the individual lawyers and then what finally&#13;
happened to them all. After a few years, John McCloy left the Bank to become the head&#13;
of the High Commission of Germany, I think it was called. And McLain left to become&#13;
his lawyer. So they both left to go to Europe.&#13;
&#13;
When McLain left, he was succeeded by a man by the name of Davidson Sommers, Dave&#13;
Sommers. Sommers had been hired before but didnâ&#128;&#153;t come until a little later. He was all&#13;
ready to come to become general counsel. He was a partner in one of the good New&#13;
York law firms as well. Anyway, McLain left and then Sommers became general&#13;
counsel. He stayed with the Bank for several years as general counsel, and then he left to&#13;
become president or chairman of the board of the Equitable Life Insurance Company. He&#13;
was a very well-known guy around town. When he died, as a matter of fact, there was a&#13;
big editorial about him in The Washington Post.&#13;
&#13;
When he left he was succeeded as general counsel by Ronnie Broches, whom I&#13;
mentioned. As I said, he was the one who knew about the things we had to deal with&#13;
more than anybody else. When Broches became general counsel, a man by the name of&#13;
Ellsworth Clark and I became assistant general counsels, both of us.&#13;
&#13;
Let me get back to Sommers for a minute. Sommers came down, as I say, from a New&#13;
York law firm. But it just so happens that I had met Sommers during the war, because he&#13;
was chief of staff or personal assistant to McCloy. I had some business to deal with after&#13;
my meeting with Jack, I went to see him and I ended up talking to Dave Sommers, who&#13;
was then Colonel Sommers. So I got to know him then somewhat. Anyway, Sommers&#13;
became general counsel. After he left, as I say, Broches became general counsel.&#13;
&#13;
Ellsworth Clark -- he was a very interesting fellow, too. He was very much the Cravath&#13;
model. He was on the Harvard Law Review. As a matter of fact, he was in the same law&#13;
school class as Dave Sommers. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think they knew each other, because I donâ&#128;&#153;t think&#13;
Sommers was on the Law Review. There was a big difference between lawyers who&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
were on the Law Review and those who werenâ&#128;&#153;t on the Law Review -- real snobby&#13;
difference. The Law Review people kept to themselves pretty much.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, Clark was on the Law Review. He was a good old New Englander. You can&#13;
tell, Ellsworth Clark. He was from Maine. During the war he became the assistant&#13;
general counsel of OPA. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the Office of Price Administration. In that job, he hired -&#13;
- I think he hired -- more lawyers than anybody in the government. Some 200 lawyers he&#13;
hired in order to take care of price controls during the war. After that job, he came to the&#13;
World Bank. He then became, as I say -- he was one of the early lawyers. He was there&#13;
when I came.&#13;
&#13;
He became assistant general counsel, as I did. But his work primarily was in connection&#13;
with administration. He occasionally got involved in the normal operations of the bank&#13;
but not much. He did the administrative work and Iâ&#128;&#153;d do the rest of it.&#13;
&#13;
The other lawyers were -- the one I remember most clearly was a guy named Lars&#13;
Bengston. Bengston was a very interesting fellow, a very good lawyer, but a very&#13;
unusual man, to put it mildly. He also went to Harvard Law School and was on the&#13;
Harvard Law Review. Some of his classmates at Harvard Law School told me that&#13;
Bengston had one of the highest grades in the class at Harvard Law School but they could&#13;
never figure out how come because he never came to class. But he was very smart. I&#13;
guess he didnâ&#128;&#153;t need to. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know. But he was a very unusual guy. In a way, the&#13;
same thing happened when he came to the Bank. But before he came to the Bank he got&#13;
a job with the firm that was almost at a par with Cravath, the Davis Polk firm in New&#13;
York, the same kind of firm.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What is the name?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Gardner and Reed -- something like that. Davis&#13;
Polk, a big firm, still one of the biggest and fanciest and one of the richest firms in the&#13;
country. Anyway, they were like Cravath, all very proper but very good lawyers.&#13;
Anyway, Bengston was a pretty sloppy guy. He was walking in the hall -- he told me&#13;
about this story himself. He was walking in the hall one day when the managing partner&#13;
of the firm saw him. He said, â&#128;&#156;Bengston, I think you need a haircut and you ought to&#13;
shine your shoes.â&#128;? When that happened, Bengston promptly quit. [Laughter]. He quit&#13;
Davis Polk, and the Bank â&#128;&#147; McLain -- hired him. He became a lawyer.&#13;
&#13;
As a lawyer, he was very funny. He would go off on trips and we never knew where he&#13;
was. He would go and do his job, whatever it was, but the rest of us in Washington never&#13;
knew where he was. The result of his behavior resulted in a change in the Bank rules.&#13;
We made it plain that anybody traveling abroad had to keep in touch with Washington to&#13;
tell us where they were.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So this was travel abroad that he was undertaking.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Travel abroad. I still remember, he was married when he was in the navy.&#13;
He went to Brazil during the war and became an expert in Portuguese. He married a&#13;
Brazilian lady who, in fact, was sort of a go-go dancer. She used to come to the Bank&#13;
whenever Lars, whenever Bengston was away and we never knew where he was. She&#13;
never knew where he was either. Sheâ&#128;&#153;d come to the Bank and sheâ&#128;&#153;d come to my office&#13;
and say, â&#128;&#156;Whereâ&#128;&#153;s Lars? Whereâ&#128;&#153;s Lars?â&#128;? [Laughter]. â&#128;&#156;We donâ&#128;&#153;t know where Lars is.â&#128;?&#13;
Anyway, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve digressed for a minute.&#13;
&#13;
I used to have Legal Department parties in my backyard. She would come, and weâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
have dancing. She would do her go-go dancing. She was a very conservative lady,&#13;
actually, but she was a good go-go dancer.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Where were you living at the time? In the District?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Partly in Chevy Chase [Maryland] and then partly out here [Potomac,&#13;
Maryland]. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been out here in Potomac about thirty or forty years already. Some of&#13;
the parties, I think, were right back here, but Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure even where they were.&#13;
&#13;
Bengston, as far as legal work was concerned, he was the lawyer on a matter involving&#13;
the dispute between India and Pakistan concerning the Indus waters, a big river. That&#13;
was a major dispute between them, which, if it hadnâ&#128;&#153;t been settled, could well have&#13;
resulted in war, sort of like the Kashmir dispute, which is still ongoing. But that was&#13;
settled because the Bank was very much involved in the financing and construction of&#13;
dams across the Indus River between the countries. He was the lawyer on it. He did a&#13;
very good job. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s about all I can tell you about the legal work he did. Itâ&#128;&#153;s all I&#13;
remember.&#13;
&#13;
He left the Bank and became a chief financial advisor to the company based in Canada&#13;
called the Brazilian Traction Power and Light, but operating in Latin America. It was the&#13;
biggest company in Latin America. He was there for some years, got very rich. He&#13;
worked on a deal with the Bank, with me mostly, to restructure the loan we had made to&#13;
Brazilian Traction for the financing of some waterworks in Brazil -- big loans. He was&#13;
instrumental for Brazilian Traction in making the deal more suitable and profitable to&#13;
Brazilian Traction. He made a lot of money. He invested very heavily in Brazilian â&#128;&#147; itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
no secret; he told me about it -- Brazilian Traction stock, because he knew the stock&#13;
would go up, and it did. He finally retired. Last time I saw him he had come to the&#13;
Bank. He went down to Brazil to live. He was divorced from his go-go dancer wife and&#13;
married another Brazilian lady, a Brazilian lawyer. He came to the Bank with purple&#13;
hair, I think, purple or pink or something. A very strange guy, and he finally died, and&#13;
that was about it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You mentioned that there was a distinction between the people who had&#13;
served on the Harvard Law Review and those who hadnâ&#128;&#153;t. Was that distinction a sort of&#13;
social -- can you --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Everything.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Everything. Okay. Can you describe it?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Everything. When I first -- for example, I first realized how important this&#13;
was when I went to work for the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC was&#13;
like that, too, in a way. The guy I knew best at the SEC was a fellow by the name of&#13;
Moose [Max] Isenberg. He was on the Harvard Law Review. We both lived together in&#13;
Virginia, in Colonial Village. He had a baby. I remember we used to get together&#13;
practically every Sunday. Isenberg invited his buddies from Harvard Law School.&#13;
Theyâ&#128;&#153;d come every Sunday, the lawyers --they were all men -- and their wives, because&#13;
they all wanted to see the little baby. Nobody had any babies. Weâ&#128;&#153;d sit around, but&#13;
every single one of them was on the Law Review.&#13;
&#13;
The guys who werenâ&#128;&#153;t on the Law Review, they were very conscious of the fact that they&#13;
werenâ&#128;&#153;t. Both socially and professionally, they were a group apart. I know several&#13;
people who never got over the fact that they werenâ&#128;&#153;t on the Harvard Law Review and&#13;
they were treated sort of as second-class citizens.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So this was an elite of the elite.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: And how! Incidentally, those are the people that Cravath wanted. As a&#13;
matter of fact, thatâ&#128;&#153;s what McNamara wanted, too. I remember he told me when he&#13;
became president, he said he wanted people who were either from the Harvard or Yale&#13;
law reviews or Rhodes Scholars. That was about it. [Laughter]. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what he had --&#13;
mostly Rhodes Scholars, actually. But thatâ&#128;&#153;s how I met all these guys. Some of them&#13;
were at the SEC and some were other places. Now, Isenberg, it just so happened, was a&#13;
friend of Felix Frankfurter. And Frankfurter would call him up â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;d hear the calls. Heâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
call him up. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve forgotten whether he was at Harvard Law School then or he was on the&#13;
Supreme Court. I forget. But he wanted to place -- probably at Harvard Law School. He&#13;
wanted to place good students in Washington in jobs. Isenberg would call up his buddies&#13;
from different parts of the government and get jobs. If Frankfurter recommended them,&#13;
heâ&#128;&#153;d get jobs. After Isenberg got to know me better, he said to me, â&#128;&#156;Lester, if you want&#13;
to leave the SEC, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll get you a job anywhere in the government you want.â&#128;? It was that&#13;
kind of way that Washington worked in those days. Isenberg left. He became law clerk&#13;
of Justice [Hugo] Black, and that was it. Anyway, thatâ&#128;&#153;s an answer to your question&#13;
about Harvard Law Review boys. Itâ&#128;&#153;s still the same, in a way.&#13;
&#13;
Another interesting lawyer was a fellow by the name of Jean Villechaise, a Frenchman.&#13;
He came to the Bank. He was a French lawyer. During the war, he was in the French&#13;
Army and he met and married an American girl who was driving an ambulance during&#13;
the war. She happened to be the daughter of a Morgan president, whose name I have&#13;
forgotten. He was president of J. P. Morgan. Villechaise told me this story. He and I&#13;
used to talk a lot about the differences between American systems and French systems.&#13;
He was very conscious of it, as I was, about different classes in societies and legal&#13;
structures. This was all relevant, really, to the work we were doing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Lester Nurick&#13;
                                      Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But he told me that after the war he came and he wanted to visit his father-in-law, whom&#13;
he hadnâ&#128;&#153;t met. His wife and he got married in France during the war. The father-in-law&#13;
lived out in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, which is one of the fancy suburbs of&#13;
Philadelphia. He went there and took a train to Chestnut Hill. He walked, I guess, to this&#13;
guyâ&#128;&#153;s fancy place. He had a big estate in Chestnut Hill. He walked to the entrance to it,&#13;
and there was this old guy driving around in this tractor. He went and said, â&#128;&#156;Could you&#13;
please tell me where I can find Mr. So-and-so? I want to say hello to him. He doesnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
know, but Iâ&#128;&#153;m his son-in-law.â&#128;? The guy said, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;m the guy youâ&#128;&#153;re looking for.â&#128;?&#13;
Villechaise never got over the fact that the president of Morgan would drive around in a&#13;
tractor. He said, â&#128;&#156;In France this would never happen -- never.â&#128;? You didnâ&#128;&#153;t behave that&#13;
way. You got servants to do all that. You didnâ&#128;&#153;t drive around on a tractor. He never&#13;
forgot it. He used to talk to me about this to indicate the differences between the two&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
But he was at the Bank and was a good lawyer. He stayed in the Bank until Dave&#13;
Sommers became general counsel for a while. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t get along very well. I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
know why. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think Sommers appreciated Villechaise. Villechaise finally left and he&#13;
went back to Paris. In Paris he became the head, president, of a Morgan subsidiary bank&#13;
in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So this was a fairly international group of people as it developed.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. This is one of the interesting things about McLain, because he&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t like particularly to hire foreigners or have anything to do with them, or New&#13;
Dealers, which is why he didnâ&#128;&#153;t get along with Luxford particularly, because Luxford had&#13;
been a US Treasury lawyer. Some non-Americans were hired -- in the Bank they were&#13;
not called foreigners.&#13;
&#13;
One was an Englishman by the name of Dick Richards, Reginald Richards, Dick&#13;
Richards. He came from one of the big, good London firms, an English lawyer, very&#13;
good lawyer. Another one was Claude Kaufmann. Kaufmann came from the biggest&#13;
firm in Brazil, Peniero Nato firm. He went to Harvard Law School to get his masterâ&#128;&#153;s. A&#13;
lot of the foreigners came to this country to study, get masterâ&#128;&#153;s degrees, usually at&#13;
Harvard but not only at Harvard, other places as well. While he was at Harvard Law&#13;
School, he told me, he loved it. He said, â&#128;&#156;I never worked so hard in my life. I worked&#13;
every single night except Christmas, and I never wanted to go back to Brazil. In Brazil&#13;
was just parties all the time, and I like to party but not all the time. I like to work.â&#128;? He&#13;
was asked to come back by this law firm to become managing partner. But he didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
want to do it. He never went back to Brazil. He stayed with the Bank. He and Dick&#13;
Richards and a guy [Jean] Blondiel and I all worked on the origins, the beginnings of the&#13;
International Finance Corporation. They all worked for me, really, so I got to know them&#13;
very well.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So this would have been in the early â&#128;&#152;50s roughly?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes, right after the IFC started. They had been there and they were working&#13;
as Bank lawyers. They were assigned, as I was, to IFC when the IFC started (1956).&#13;
&#13;
Blondiel was this Belgian lawyer I mentioned. He was a good lawyer, a pompous guy, a&#13;
self-important fellow. He left after several years to join the Cleary Gottlieb firm. He&#13;
became the head partner of the firm in Europe. Heâ&#128;&#153;s the one I mentioned that Kaufmann&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#153;t stand, didnâ&#128;&#153;t like at all.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But you didnâ&#128;&#153;t mention that on tape.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Oh, I didnâ&#128;&#153;t? [Laughter].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You mentioned that to me off the tape.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. There were two stories. I ought to talk about Kaufmann and&#13;
that very first story.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: How do you spell Kaufmannâ&#128;&#153;s name?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: K-A-U-F-M-A-N-N. The Claude is C-L-A-U-D-E. Kaufmann and I went to&#13;
Paris to work on an IFC deal, and the people we were working with took us to the Folies&#13;
BergÃ¨re. We had seats in the very first row. There werenâ&#128;&#153;t even rows for those. We had&#13;
divans, little divan chairs. During the Folies BergÃ¨re, Kaufmann and I were sitting&#13;
together. One of the acts was a man that came across stage -- this was after the nude&#13;
chorus girls went backstage -- came outside, came to the stage, and he wanted to get&#13;
somebody from the audience to come up and work with, help him. I had been to Folies&#13;
before that -- I think it was during the war even -- and I remembered this guy. He made&#13;
whoever he got up on stage act like a real idiot, take his clothes off and dance around.&#13;
&#13;
He looked at me and I was dressed in my proper Wall Street lawyerâ&#128;&#153;s outfit. He came up&#13;
to me and pointed to me and said, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;d like you to come up on stage with me.? So I said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to.â&#128;? He kept trying to urge me to come, and I kept on saying, â&#128;&#156;No, I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t feel like it.â&#128;? So while we were talking, Kaufmann, who was a real party boy, said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;ll come.â&#128;? So he said, â&#128;&#156;Fine.â&#128;? So Kaufmann came up on the stage and, as I said, he&#13;
became the laughing stock of the whole theater. Of course, he would dance around, take&#13;
off his clothes, look like a real idiot. That was it.&#13;
&#13;
But the interesting part of the story was that two years later Kaufmann and I worked on&#13;
another IFC deal in Brazil, some Brazilian company. The Brazilian Minister of Finance&#13;
came to Washington, and we were invited to lunch at the Brazilian Embassy to meet the&#13;
Brazilian Minister of Finance. So we went and we met the minister, and he looked at us.&#13;
We said, â&#128;&#156;Oh, how do you do?â&#128;? He said, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;ve met you guys, havenâ&#128;&#153;t I?â&#128;? We said, â&#128;&#156;No,&#13;
weâ&#128;&#153;ve never met you. We donâ&#128;&#153;t know you.â&#128;? Throughout lunch he kept on saying, â&#128;&#156;Well,&#13;
you look familiar to me.â&#128;? We said, â&#128;&#156;No, weâ&#128;&#153;re not familiar to you.â&#128;? Finally, towards the&#13;
end of the lunch, he said, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got it. Werenâ&#128;&#153;t you two fellows at the Folies BergÃ¨re two&#13;
years ago?â&#128;? We said yes. He said, Well, I was at the Folies sitting right in back of you&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
two.â&#128;? Then he turned to Kaufmann and he pointed at Kaufmann and he said, â&#128;&#156;Kaufmann,&#13;
I want to tell you youâ&#128;&#153;re not as smart as your friend.â&#128;? That was all. That was it.&#13;
&#13;
The other story about Kaufmann was that, as I said, he didnâ&#128;&#153;t much like this guy Blondiel&#13;
who was a pompous, self-important fellow. Somehow, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know how, he got hold of&#13;
Blondielâ&#128;&#153;s calling cards when he was working in the Paris office of Cleary Gottlieb. In&#13;
those days, youâ&#128;&#153;d walk around Paris and literally every street corner had one prostitute or&#13;
more just standing there looking for business. Kaufmann went up -- I was walking with&#13;
him. We walked around Paris. He walked up to what must have been about fifteen or&#13;
twenty prostitutes, and to each one of them he would say, â&#128;&#156;Here, my name is Jean&#13;
Blondiel, and Iâ&#128;&#153;m working in this law firm. Why donâ&#128;&#153;t you call me tomorrow?â&#128;? Further&#13;
than that, I know not. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what happened after that. [Laughter]. Or how&#13;
Blondiel responded to all these calls. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s all I know.&#13;
&#13;
Then there were a couple of other foreign lawyers. There was Georges Delaume, a&#13;
French lawyer, a good lawyer, but he spent most of his time writing law books, published&#13;
about five or six volumes of law books. He too used to speak about France and the&#13;
French system. Unlike most of the French who went to the fancy -- the French are more&#13;
stratified, in a way, than the Americans. The French Grande Ã&#137;cole -- do you know about&#13;
the Grande Ã&#137;cole?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes, Les Grandes Ã&#137;coles. I do.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: But Delaume was a poor boy.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Itâ&#128;&#153;s important to get your impression of the way he conveyed that to&#13;
you.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: He told me exactly that. He said the French system was very stratified.&#13;
Unless you went to certain schools, you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get proper jobs. And he did. He got&#13;
himself -- he was a good student, I guess, and he went to one of the Grandes Ã&#137;coles. He&#13;
went to law school in France. Then he came to this country and worked for the World&#13;
Bank, which is how I got to know him. He was very interested in these social matters,&#13;
which affected legal matters as well. So I learned about that from his point of view.&#13;
Unlike Villechaise, who was proper -- he was from a banking family -- Delaume was&#13;
from a poor family. But he spent a lot of time doing that, as I say. He left and became a&#13;
lawyer who also -- stayed in Washington for a while, and then he divorced his wife and&#13;
then married a Chinese lady, and he left. As far as I know, heâ&#128;&#153;s still alive, but I havenâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
heard or talked to him for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
The other foreigner was a fellow by the name of Leopoldo Cancio. Cancio came from&#13;
Cuba. He too was a son of the rich. His parents were rich something or other. He got his&#13;
masterâ&#128;&#153;s here somewhere. I forget where. He was a good lawyer, very right-wing. He&#13;
was so right-wing on certain matters that he used to get into squabbles with other&#13;
lawyers, because they were hardly any right-wingers in the World Bank, and he was. He&#13;
stayed. He was there a long time. He finally left. He was very much involved in&#13;

collecting stamps. I believe when he left he became -- that was his life, stamp collecting&#13;
and some kind of business doing that stuff. I havenâ&#128;&#153;t seen or heard about him either in a&#13;
long time. Who did I forget?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: There was a woman, Morsey.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Oh, Virginia Morsey, yes. I forgot about her. She was one of the very early&#13;
lawyers, too. I think she came around the same time I did. I remember this, too. This&#13;
shows how times have changed. She went to law school to some -- I forget -- someplace&#13;
out in middle west. When she got out of law school, she was at the top of her class.&#13;
There was a party given by the law school for the graduates at some club, and she was&#13;
not allowed to come to the party because she was a woman. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t allow women.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: An all-male establishment.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: All-male establishment, and that was it. No women allowed. Washington&#13;
was like that, too. Anyway, she told me about this story. She came to the Bank. She&#13;
was a perfectly good lawyer, a very orderly woman. While she was there -- she was a&#13;
good-looking lady -- she met and married this General Wheeler. Wheeler had been the&#13;
Chief of the Corps of Engineers during the war, a very distinguished lieutenant general.&#13;
He was very influential in the Bank, in a way, which Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you about in a minute. They&#13;
got married. I remember we used to be friendly and I used to go to their house, my wife&#13;
and I. Weâ&#128;&#153;d go to their house for dinner. I had never been to dinner parties like this in&#13;
my life, because they had arranged to the last iota of detail what the two of them should&#13;
do to take care of things around the house -- who would do the shopping and who would&#13;
do the cooking and who would do the putting away of the dishes and who would do the&#13;
washing, everything. They were down to a T, just very militarily, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, they were married. They seemed to be happily married. He died after a while,&#13;
and then she ended up marrying another general and went up to Alaska. She was a very&#13;
nice young woman.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: She must have been younger than General Wheeler. You retire as a&#13;
three-star in your late fifties.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. Youâ&#128;&#153;re right. She was a good deal younger, but it didnâ&#128;&#153;t seem to&#13;
matter. She didnâ&#128;&#153;t seem to have any other boyfriends, as far as I know. That was it. But&#13;
youâ&#128;&#153;re right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Let me ask you about the whole atmosphere in this period, say, â&#128;&#152;46 to&#13;
â&#128;&#152;56. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve got this group of bright, relatively young lawyers. Were you one of the&#13;
older ones? You were already thirty-plus by the time you started there. Or were they all&#13;
roughly in the same age bracket?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Roughly the same, yes. Villechaise was a little younger. Oh, I mentioned&#13;
Franz Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was the Yalie. He had gone to Yale Law School and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
very much entranced with the Yale Law School, was on the Yale Law Review, clerked on&#13;
the Second Circuit. Then from there he went to the Bank. He was hired by Chester&#13;
McLain. As I say, he was a Yalie, but even so, he was hired. That was unusual. He was&#13;
a perfectly good lawyer. He left the Bank after a while and joined one of the good law&#13;
firms in Washington. Heâ&#128;&#153;s still here. I havenâ&#128;&#153;t seen him in a long time.&#13;
&#13;
Hugh Scott was another from the Harvard Law Review, a fine lawyer. He later became&#13;
deputy general counsel.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This whole group coming in right after the war -- the Bank was&#13;
constructed partly as an effort to solve the international problems of the interwar period.&#13;
You said earlier that you were not particularly conscious of international economics as&#13;
you began your career there. What sort of imperatives did you feel as a group? What&#13;
was it that was motivating you as lawyers for this new institution, really an untried&#13;
institution, the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a good question and itâ&#128;&#153;s something that I think is interesting, because&#13;
it relates to a lot more than just us. Let me talk in connection with the same thing about&#13;
the first three senior people in the Bank, who came from Wall Street. I mentioned this&#13;
before to some extent. John McCloy, certainly, who became president; Eugene Black,&#13;
who became the US executive director and then became president; Robert Garner, who&#13;
also came from Wall Street and became the chief assistant to McCloy. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what&#13;
he was called; senior vice president maybe. But then he left that job to become president&#13;
of the International Finance Corporation, IFC. He was the first and only person that ever&#13;
became president of IFC. He became president in order to preserve his stature as a big-&#13;
shot and Wall Street executive. He was with Guaranty Trust. He was one of the senior&#13;
bankers there. He was at Guaranty Trust, and I think Black was with Chase. McCloy&#13;
was a Cravath partner.&#13;
&#13;
But they all came from Wall Street and they all had the same attitude about life. They&#13;
were conservative, Wall Street types, rich, successful, well known in the work they were&#13;
doing, but they all realized when they came to the Bank that they became international&#13;
civil servants and they therefore had to act as such, and they did. And one of the&#13;
interesting things was -- and I forget who told me about this -- they all -- when they first&#13;
came down to Washington, the three of them, they moved into the house of Nelson&#13;
Rockefeller, who was a friend of theirs. This was before their wives joined them. So&#13;
they were all -- the three of them came down, living in Rockefellerâ&#128;&#153;s house together.&#13;
They would meet every night to talk about the future of the Bank, what they ought to be&#13;
doing.&#13;
&#13;
As I say, they developed -- they realized they were international civil servants and they&#13;
had to behave as such. They were subject to all kinds of pressures to help their friends&#13;
get jobs or contracts. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t behave that way. They, along with General Wheeler,&#13;
started the system in the Bank of international competitive bidding on Bank projects,&#13;
which is very important, because under that system you gave jobs to the people who bid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
for them and were the best suited to do a particular job, the cheapest, but certainly&#13;
qualified people who get the jobs wherever they came from.&#13;
&#13;
So they did not go around hiring -- hardly at all hired people who were their friends. A&#13;
lot of people wanted jobs. Several of them told me. I know McCloy -- I think maybe&#13;
every single one of them said that when they came, or were thinking of joining the Bank,&#13;
their friends at Wall Street thought they were crazy to come. The Bank was -- what was&#13;
the Bank? Nothing. It was going to be a charitable institution, get rid of its money, it&#13;
would have nothing left, and there wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be any Bank anymore. But they decided to&#13;
come and they proved their friends wrong, because they started an institution which did&#13;
very well, as far as I know, still does very well. [Interruption].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You had started to talk about the commitment that McCloy and others&#13;
had to being international civil servants rather than being circumscribed by the national&#13;
interests or even the interests of their friends, their professional friends.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Youâ&#128;&#153;re right. It was very interesting the way they behaved. I think that was&#13;
true of the staff generally.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: How did they communicate that to those of you in the trenches, so to&#13;
speak?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I think exactly that way and also by the kind of policies they adopted; in&#13;
other words, trying to be as fair and proper in dealing with all these very complicated&#13;
new things as they came along. It became pretty clear in the Bank -- when people came&#13;
to the Bank, they realized that that was the atmosphere that they were expected to&#13;
conform to. They did.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You mentioned Wheeler, General Wheeler, who insisted on&#13;
international competitive bidding as a major factor. Did that play out -- or how did that&#13;
play out in your dealings as a lawyer with people?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: We had to make sure that the processes were fair and that they were legally&#13;
correct. All of this became very complicated both legally and financially and&#13;
economically. After a while you got to know better what you had to deal with, and we&#13;
did. We all became quite expert at all these things as time went on, but it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t easy.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of the things you mentioned in one of the rÃ©sumÃ©s was consultation&#13;
with Lufthansa in the very early period.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. Let me talk about that some other time, because I remember we did but&#13;
I forget -- they were interesting but I forget exactly what happened. [Laughter]. There&#13;
are so many things Iâ&#128;&#153;ve forgotten.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Well, itâ&#128;&#153;s been a few years since youâ&#128;&#153;ve had to deal with those things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I always had a lousy memory. Not a matter of age, but that doesnâ&#128;&#153;t help me.&#13;
[Laughter]. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll look at the stuff that Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got down there and come see [unclear] talking&#13;
about.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Youâ&#128;&#153;ve talked about the young lawyers. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve talked about the&#13;
leadership and the atmosphere that they created. One of the issues that McCloy had to&#13;
face very early was the relationship between the president and the board of directors, or&#13;
the executive directors, and board of governors.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. Let me talk about that. [Pause]. I made notes about these things. One&#13;
of the things that developed in the early days of the Bank -- several things developed as a&#13;
result of this kind of attitude. The adoption of rules which restricted people from hiring&#13;
close relatives for certain kinds of matters. That became a big deal later in Wolfensohnâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
tenure, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t have to talk about that. Anyway, there was that rule. Then another&#13;
one was on a restricted gift rule. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t take gifts over a nominal amount, and if&#13;
you did you had to give them back. If you took a gift you had to give them back or do&#13;
something with them. I remember in one case Gene Black was given a very expensive&#13;
present, and we made him get rid of it. But most important was the rule about&#13;
international competitive bidding. There were certain exceptions to that, but in general,&#13;
international competitive bidding is the rule. [Pause].&#13;
&#13;
In Bob Garnerâ&#128;&#153;s oral history, which I think was the most interesting of all the oral&#13;
histories Iâ&#128;&#153;ve read, he talks about the fact that McCloy, when he was offered the&#13;
presidency, had said he wanted to manage the Bank under the â&#128;&#156;supervisionâ&#128;? of the&#13;
executive directors. Otherwise he would go back to Wall Street. And the executive&#13;
directors agreed, after there was a dispute with Emilio Collado, who wanted the job. He&#13;
was the US executive director and wanted to become president of the Bank. Anyway, the&#13;
executive directors agreed to this, and the rules were -- this kind of policy was reflected&#13;
in rules adopted by the executive directors in June of 1947. There were meetings of a&#13;
special executive directors committee, and they recommended the adoption of those&#13;
rules. The rules provided, in brief, that the executive directors were responsible for&#13;
â&#128;&#156;policy matters.â&#128;? Second, that if the president decides not to make a loan, he will advise&#13;
the executive directors. He has to make decisions about whether or not to make a loan.&#13;
If he decides to make a loan, he will ask the directors for approval. But there canâ&#128;&#153;t be&#13;
any loans made without the imprimatur of the president. Then this rule -- there are very&#13;
detailed rules about procedure, the establishment of the various committees, who can do&#13;
what. This statement of policy was revised in September 1956.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Youâ&#128;&#153;ve said there was a revision in 1956, but beyond that youâ&#128;&#153;re not&#13;
sure.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right. One of the interesting things to me about all this was thatâ&#128;¦&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: When these rules were adopted I was at the Bank at the time. Whenever I&#13;
went to a board meeting -- we used to have meetings once or twice every week -- I&#13;
carried with me this statement of procedures, these rules. Not once in all the years I was&#13;
at the Bank was it necessary for me to refer to it. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure anybody ever realized they&#13;
existed anymore after a few years. The questions would arise, but it seemed to be&#13;
generally accepted that matters of policy would be decided by the directors, and&#13;
everything else, management and operations, by the president. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way it was&#13;
done. As I mentioned to you before, this became a very big issue with George Woods.&#13;
The issue really came to what is a matter of policy and whatâ&#128;&#153;s not a matter of policy.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That was the question I was going to raise for you. How did that get&#13;
decided in those issues?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, it got decided as a matter of ad hoc decision as time went on. Some of&#13;
it was pretty obvious; some of it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure whether I mentioned this, but when&#13;
McNamara became president, he went out of his way to ask the directors for approval of&#13;
various acts. I told him from time to time -- I was his lawyer for many years -- I said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;You donâ&#128;&#153;t have to do this, Bob.â&#128;? He said, â&#128;&#156;No, I want to do it. I want to get the&#13;
directors involved and I want to get them to approve these things.â&#128;? And they always did.&#13;
I know the issue has arisen in other cases, and where it stands now, I just donâ&#128;&#153;t know. I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t think thereâ&#128;&#153;s anything more to say about that issue.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of the issues early on is the development of the Cold War and the&#13;
tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States. Certainly from 1946-â&#128;&#152;47-â&#128;&#152;48&#13;
on that becomes an issue. To what extent did that influence the dealings of the legal&#13;
department that you were a part of?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: At the very beginning, not at all, except that we were very much involved in&#13;
the Marshall Plan. As I mentioned last time, the first thing we did was to make a loan to&#13;
France. That loan, incidentally -- I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I described it very much -- but one of the&#13;
interesting things about the loan was it was a very big loan for those days, $250 million.&#13;
It was to help the reconstruction of France under what was called the Monnet Plan. The&#13;
loan agreement -- I was the operating lawyer on that matter. I drafted a loan agreement,&#13;
under McLainâ&#128;&#153;s supervision, of course, a very matter-of-fact agreement based largely on&#13;
the kind of deals that Wall Street lawyers were familiar with, nothing very elaborate. But&#13;
one thing we had in the agreement was a negative pledge clause. Do you know what a&#13;
negative pledge clause is?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Youâ&#128;&#153;ve mentioned the negative pledge clause before, but Iâ&#128;&#153;m Not sure I&#13;
fully understand it.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The negative pledge clause, in effect, says -- there are various forms of it --&#13;
in effect, says, â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;ll lend you the money, but you cannot borrow money from anybody&#13;
else and give security unless you give us equal security.â&#128;? We had that. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a standard&#13;
clause in these international financings, domestic as well. We had a draft of the negative&#13;
pledge clause in the loan agreement we gave to the French. This was about the only thing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
they objected to. They thought this would be an affront to their national pride and they&#13;
refused to agree to the negative pledge clause. Instead they said they would give us a&#13;
letter signed by the Minister of Finance saying that they would not pledge without giving&#13;
the Bank adequate assurance. But they did not want that in an agreement. We agreed to&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the only time the Bank, as far as I know, in its entire history has agreed not to put&#13;
in a negative pledge clause in its loan agreements. It became just a matter of standard&#13;
procedure which nobody questioned after a while. We just put it in. There would be&#13;
arguments about the details -- what you had to do to get approval and what things did not&#13;
require operation of this clause -- but that was something else again. The clause itself as&#13;
a matter of policy was written in stone, never changed.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So a government could not use the assets that had been pledged, in&#13;
effect, as collateral for the loan from the Bank to serve as collateral for any other loan.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let me put it a little differently. The Bank didnâ&#128;&#153;t normally take collateral&#13;
itself. It made loans on the full faith and credit of a government, and that was it. But&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#153;s exactly the point. If they wanted to give collateral to somebody else, then they had&#13;
to give the Bank the same collateral. In fact, this was done a few times. I think the Israeli&#13;
government once -- we made a loan to Israel and then they wanted to collateralize&#13;
another loan. They gave us adequate security. The British did it. We made a loan to a&#13;
British Commonwealth country, and they did it. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember all the cases, but it&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t happen very often. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think itâ&#128;&#153;s happened in many years, but it did happen&#13;
some years back.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Did you have any dealings with Morton Mendels?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Can you tell me a little bit about him and what his role was?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Mendels was a Canadian and he became secretary of the Bank. Secretary of&#13;
the Bank was in charge of the administration of the directors? affairs, the archivists, chief&#13;
archivists, things like that. We became friends, yes. Why are you interested in him,&#13;
incidentally?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Because he had a long career and he was in a key position and I&#13;
wondered to what extent it interfaced with the legal work that you were doing.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: We did a lot of things together, but he was not very important as far as&#13;
normal operations of the Bank were concerned.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s basically what I wanted to know, to what extent did he influence&#13;
your day-to-day activities, and the answer seems to be very little.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Ministerial stuff, really.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And Paul Rosenstein-Rodan?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: He was an interesting fellow. He was a chief economist. For some reason&#13;
the economists were not regarded in very high repute in the early days. People didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
seem to pay much attention to them and they werenâ&#128;&#153;t much involved in what was going&#13;
on. That changed over time and the Bank got to rely more on them, and they had very&#13;
fancy type economists. He was one of them. I think he was succeeded by a man named&#13;
Hollis Chenery. Chenery became chief. Chenery was a very rich fellow. I knew his&#13;
father, as a matter of fact. He was president of a big company. He was a professor of&#13;
economics at Harvard. He came down to become chief economist at the World Bank.&#13;
Again, he didnâ&#128;&#153;t play a very important role in the operations of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Back to this question that I raised earlier about the developments of the&#13;
Cold War. I think in â&#128;&#152;47 of the developments in the Mediterranean and in Greece and&#13;
Turkey, even Iran before that, the Berlin blockade, and the growing tensions around the&#13;
split between the wartime allies and what grew up to be the bipolar world. To what&#13;
extent did that shape any of the work that you were doing in the Bank? How conscious&#13;
were you of those pressures?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: We were certainly conscious of them, and they affected us from time to time,&#13;
sometimes substantially and in different ways. I will discuss these matters in some detail&#13;
in a later session. But I have some comments now. I remember, for example, there were&#13;
loans made -- contemplated, loans contemplated by the Bank called the timber loans. Are&#13;
you familiar with those, incidentally?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: They were loans made in the early days of the Bank to help European&#13;
countries finance the increased production of timber, which was in short supply. I was the&#13;
lawyer on this as well. I spent a lot of time in Europe working on it. We worked on it&#13;
together with Finland, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, I forget who else.&#13;
&#13;
We were prepared to make a loan to Czechoslovakia, which was really part of the&#13;
Russian bloc at the time, but the Czechs said to us that they didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to, at that time --&#13;
this has nothing to do with the timber loans as such, but the Czechs said to us, â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re not&#13;
going to pay you part of the subscription that we owe you because the United States owes&#13;
us for gold that they took during the war.â&#128;? To which we said, â&#128;&#156;Thatâ&#128;&#153;s got nothing to do&#13;
with the Bank. You pay us what you owe us. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s it. You can take whatever remedies&#13;
you have about your gold, take it up with the United States.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
The result of that was that the Czechs left the Bank. They withdrew from the Bank. As&#13;
far as I know -- excuse me. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t leave the Bank. They were expelled from&#13;
membership. They were expelled from membership for that reason. I believe itâ&#128;&#153;s the&#13;
only time that a country has been expelled from membership, certainly from the Bank,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
maybe from any international organization. Later on, many years later, they came back as&#13;
members of the Bank. They paid us what they were supposed to, and that was it.&#13;
&#13;
The case of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was a part of the Russian bloc, but even so, they&#13;
took part in this operation with us as one of the timber loans. [Josip Broz] Tito was head&#13;
of the government at the time. We got along fine. We worked on it. We had a very&#13;
straightforward negotiation. I was dealing with the matter. I dealt with his chief deputy,&#13;
a man by the name of Filipovic. Even though they were in the Russian bloc, and we all&#13;
knew it and they knew it, they agreed to take this loan from the Bank. It was a small loan&#13;
but a symbolic loan that this happened.&#13;
&#13;
One of the early economists, chief economists, was a man by the name of Dragoslav&#13;
Avramovic, very good fellow, very good economist. He became chief economist for a&#13;
while, and people had high regard for him, as I did. We became good friends. Some&#13;
years ago, not many years ago, I read that he left the Bank later and went back home and&#13;
became a leading citizen. I think he was chairman of the central bank. I read in the paper&#13;
that he was regarded as the logical, possible logical successor to become president of&#13;
Yugoslavia.&#13;
&#13;
When I read that in the paper, I wrote him a letter, because we had been friends. I wanted&#13;
to remind him of the old days. One of the things I reminded him was that he told me --&#13;
we talk about economics in the Bank. He said, â&#128;&#156;Lester, I could teach you all you have to&#13;
know about economics in two hours. We make a big fuss about it, but thatâ&#128;&#153;s all you need&#13;
to know. I can tell you -- it will take you two hours to know all you need to know.â&#128;?&#13;
[Laughter]. I reminded him in my letter to him -- I wrote him a letter when I saw this in&#13;
the newspaper. He wrote me back a very sweet letter, which Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got, as a matter of fact.&#13;
He said, â&#128;&#156;Itâ&#128;&#153;s still true. I think I can teach you whatever you need to know in two&#13;
hours.â&#128;? [Laughter]. But he died and his wife came back to this country and stayed living&#13;
here.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You mentioned the travel, that you were in Europe a lot. Tell me about&#13;
the sort of pace of travel and how much travel you were doing and where you were going.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I traveled a lot both in this country and abroad. One of the things the Bank&#13;
did in those days, kind of interesting really, [was] if you traveled a certain number of&#13;
days abroad, you accumulated a point for every day you went abroad. When you reached&#13;
a certain number, youâ&#128;&#153;re entitled to take your wife on a trip. But my poor wife -- we had&#13;
four little kids at home. She wasnâ&#128;&#153;t very happy about this, but she occasionally would go&#13;
with me on a trip.&#13;
&#13;
Because I think over time -- I figured this out once. I traveled outside the country about a&#13;
month a year, but that was relatively little compared to other people. But Iâ&#128;&#153;d go abroad&#13;
for a week at a time and then come home. I traveled all over the world dealing with stuff&#13;
-- a lot in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America less, but some. That was typical of the&#13;
Bank in those days, except that as time went on, the Bank got more stratified so it became&#13;
divided into different groups. The lawyers, too, are now into various groups. They&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                            35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
werenâ&#128;&#153;t in those days. As I say, I just went all over, working on these matters. I will talk&#13;
about the issues in some of these cases at a later date.&#13;
&#13;
I remember -- back to the Bank policy on travel -- and this was sort of funny. There was&#13;
a staff member who went abroad, and he took his wife with him on a trip. A points trip,&#13;
it was called. While he was away, his wife came to see us and said, â&#128;&#156;Whereâ&#128;&#153;s my&#13;
husband? I havenâ&#128;&#153;t seen him for a while.â&#128;? We said, â&#128;&#156;Well, heâ&#128;&#153;s away.â&#128;? We didnâ&#128;&#153;t know&#13;
who she was. We said, â&#128;&#156;Heâ&#128;&#153;s away on a trip with his wife.â&#128;? She says, â&#128;&#156;No, Iâ&#128;&#153;m his&#13;
wife.â&#128;? [Laughter]. What happened was he took his secretary and said she was his wife.&#13;
Anyway, when this came and we learned about this, that was the end of that fellow. He&#13;
left. [Laughter]. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what happened to him after that. He was not a lawyer.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The other thing you mentioned that may run through much of your&#13;
career is the gifts. You mentioned specifically that -- was it Eugene Black was given a&#13;
gift or someone was given a gift of substantial value, and the legal judgment was he had&#13;
to return it because that was the rule of the Bank. But in many cultures, giving a gift is a&#13;
normal part of interaction when youâ&#128;&#153;re dealing with people professionally. I wonder if&#13;
you ran into that as an issue and how the Bank dealt with it.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: We realized that, so what we did was we said, â&#128;&#156;In some cases, if you think&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#153;s the case, take it, report it, and then you can give the Bank a gift of equivalent value&#13;
and keep it or else just return it.â&#128;? This did happen, youâ&#128;&#153;re right. We were conscious of&#13;
this issue. I know I got a few gifts which I kept. I reported them, and that was it. I kept&#13;
them and I forget whether I paid the Bank money or I gave the Bank an equivalent gift. I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t remember exactly what I did, but I kept them. I wanted to keep them.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Very often they are symbols of the relationship that people are trying to&#13;
create, and if you refuse them, it disrupts --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly. Youâ&#128;&#153;re right. Youâ&#128;&#153;re insulting them.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes. Youâ&#128;&#153;re insulting the people. So itâ&#128;&#153;s interesting to know that the&#13;
Bank was sensitive to that cultural issue.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: They were. The Bank was.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of the things that I do want to get to is the creation of the IFC, the&#13;
International Finance Corporation, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if you want to address that today or&#13;
not.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a big matter, and I can talk about it. The question is, how much&#13;
longer do you want to spend?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Iâ&#128;&#153;m comfortable, but itâ&#128;&#153;s up to you. If this is something -- I think if we&#13;
address that, that will probably be the last topic.&#13;
&#13;

                                         Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let me talk about IFC. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t look at my notes about that, but I could talk&#13;
about it because I remember a lot about it. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll supplement it later if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
It was realized in the Bank that the Bank as a bank was not equipped to do some of the&#13;
things it ought to be doing, namely lending or investing in private companies. So we&#13;
developed a notion -- at first it was nothing more than that, and then it developed into an&#13;
idea -- that there ought to be a new institution, because it was immediately rejected that it&#13;
would be part of the Bank. It was felt that the Bank would -- the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s reputation&#13;
would suffer by joining private investment like that, risky investments, and it would be&#13;
quite different than the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s role.&#13;
&#13;
So after a lot of discussion, a lot of meetings, it was decided to try to move ahead on the&#13;
establishment of an International Finance Corporation. At that point, I was taken away&#13;
from the Bank, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s operations -- I was still part of the Bank -- to work on the&#13;
development of the IFC. As a lawyer, I was responsible for the drafting of the IFC&#13;
articles of agreement, which I did. As you can imagine, that took a long time, a lot of&#13;
different issues, which Iâ&#128;&#153;ll talk about another time.&#13;
&#13;
But we drafted the charter. We got it approved by the board and by the governments that&#13;
had to subscribe. They had to subscribe a certain minimum number in order to have the&#13;
IFC come into operation legally. It was done and we started doing business. In those&#13;
days, it was all part of the Bank so that the Bank staff was seconded, as I was, to work on&#13;
IFC matters.&#13;
&#13;
The lawyers were this fellow Dick Richards, whom I mentioned, Claude Kaufmann, Jean&#13;
Blondiel, and I. The four lawyers who worked on IFC matters. They all worked with me,&#13;
for me. The president of IFC was Bob Garner, as I said. The general counsel of the Bank&#13;
at the time was Ronnie Broches. His role in IFC was pretty limited, but every once in a&#13;
while heâ&#128;&#153;d get involved. He and Garner ended up not liking each other. Garner didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
like him at all.&#13;
&#13;
After a while, after several years, three or four years, Garner decided he wanted to have&#13;
his own legal department. So he asked me to become general counsel of IFC, leave the&#13;
Bank, become general counsel of IFC. I was tempted, I must say, because I liked the&#13;
work at the IFC. But Gene Black heard about this. I guess Garner told him. Black was&#13;
president and he said I should not leave. He wanted me to stay in the Bank, so I decided&#13;
to stay in the Bank. The first general counsel of IFC became this fellow, Dick Richards,&#13;
and he was responsible for the legal operations thereafter. We used to work with him&#13;
occasionally. But Broches was furious at Richards. He thought he was a traitor for doing&#13;
this, which he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t. He was a good lawyer and I used to do my best to try to keep on&#13;
good terms with him. He was a friend of mine, too. We got along fine. But for a while,&#13;
things were pretty dicey.&#13;
&#13;
After a while, we tried to get together better. We used to invite the IFC people for lunch&#13;
and meet. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I ever mentioned this before, but we had a monthly lunch&#13;
consisting of the lawyers around town we dealt with, both the domestic people, US&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Government people, and the international lawyers -- senior lawyers in their institutions.&#13;
There was the general counsel of the IFC, the general counsel of the Inter-American&#13;
[Development] Bank, and the private enterprise part of the Inter-American Bank, the&#13;
legal advisor of the State Department, the general counsel of the SEC, and the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Was IMF a part of this?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: And the Fund, yes. That was another thing about the relation of the Fund.&#13;
We werenâ&#128;&#153;t very close. But we had these monthly lunches, and they were extremely&#13;
useful. Weâ&#128;&#153;d get about ten people. We did not accept substitutes. I remember the SEC&#13;
guy was a fellow by the name of Manny Cohen, who was the chief lawyer there. When&#13;
he became chairman of the SEC, he refused to give up his seat around the table.&#13;
[Laughter]. He used to come even when he was chairman of the SEC. He was very&#13;
helpful because, as I told you before, we had a lot of trouble with the SEC, but this&#13;
changed over time. We got to be friendly with them because we behaved ourselves and&#13;
they behaved themselves, too.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I can imagine that that interchange over lunch, sort of informally, was&#13;
very, very useful.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It certainly was. It certainly was.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: How long did that go on?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It went on until [Ibrahim F. I.] Shihata became general counsel, and he&#13;
decided he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to spend the money.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You mean the lunches were financed by the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So that was late, â&#128;&#152;82 or something like that.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It was. We did it for quite many years and then he decided to quit, and so&#13;
they never did it again. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re trying to do it again now, I gather, but Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure.&#13;
Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a new general counsel and Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to talk to him about this. I think itâ&#128;&#153;s a good&#13;
idea.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It sounds like a wonderful idea.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Anyway, the IFC went on and they did very interesting things. I myself had&#13;
one very interesting operation in Chile. There was a Mantos Blancos, it was called, mine,&#13;
owned by a guy named Hochschild, who was the leading industrialist in Latin America.&#13;
He owned this mine. They came to us asking us to make an investment in the mine. We&#13;
worked on it for quite a while with the Chileans and their lawyers, and we finally ended&#13;
up with a draft of an agreement that was acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But Garner didnâ&#128;&#153;t like Hochschild. Garner was president of IFC. I remember I got a call&#13;
from him one night at home when we were prepared to finish it up and sign the&#13;
agreement. He said -- this is very self-serving, but Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to tell you anyway, and Iâ&#128;&#153;ll&#13;
tell you why in a minute. He said, â&#128;&#156;I donâ&#128;&#153;t like Hochschild. I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to have&#13;
anything to do with him. What do you think?â&#128;? I said -- well, it happens that the general&#13;
manager that we dealt with was a very good fellow, a very responsible man. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t like&#13;
Hochschild either. So I said, â&#128;&#156;No, we ought to go ahead with this deal. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a good deal.&#13;
We ought to do it.â&#128;? He said, â&#128;&#156;All right, if you say so, weâ&#128;&#153;ll do it.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
So he made a $2 million loan in IFC. It was the best investment IFC made. I think they&#13;
made a couple hundred million dollars in that mine. It may still even have an interest in&#13;
it. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: How do you spell Mantos Blancos?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: M-A-N-T-O-S, B-L-A-N-C-O-S.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Is there more about IFC, about that phase of your career, that&#13;
you want to talk about?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Letâ&#128;&#153;s leave it. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll talk more about it later.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Then I think letâ&#128;&#153;s wrap it for today. Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thanks for coming.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is an interview with Lester Nurick, conducted February 20th, 2004,&#13;
at his home in Potomac, Maryland. The interviewer is Robert P. Grathwol, interviewing&#13;
for the World Bank. This is side one of tape one.&#13;
&#13;
Go ahead.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Now, what Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been talking about is the remnants of the US program to deal&#13;
with so-called disloyal people. This was during the McCarthy era.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Right. You had mentioned that that came up in quite striking ways in&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It did indeed. Start with the Truman executive order. President Truman&#13;
issued an executive order regarding the loyalty of Americans and prescribing a procedure&#13;
to deal with them.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Can you date that order for me? Do you know?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: No. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember the date.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll find that.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Iâ&#128;&#153;d be interested myself. When that happened, the question arose as to what&#13;
the United States would do and want to do with Bank staffers who were Americans and&#13;
also with people that the Bank was considering hiring. We started to talk with the people&#13;
in the United States government about this, and we were not very happy about the&#13;
procedures they were talking about. The main thing that I recall that we didnâ&#128;&#153;t like was&#13;
the fact that the United States investigators wanted to come to the Bank, the premises of&#13;
the Bank, to investigate Bank staff there. It wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t change the nature of what they&#13;
would be doing, but we just didnâ&#128;&#153;t like the fact that theyâ&#128;&#153;d be on the Bank premises to do&#13;
it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of my immediate questions is how was it that the American&#13;
government exercised any authority over the Bank, which is an international institution?&#13;
Under what sort of legal arrangement did that take place?&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         40&#13;

&#13;
NURICK: There were no legal arrangements. The main power that the United States&#13;
had over the Bank, aside from its thirty-odd percent of the voting power, which changed&#13;
over time, the Bank had to rely on the United States markets to raise money. Otherwise it&#13;
would go out of business. We got -- once it became clear that we werenâ&#128;&#152;t very happy&#13;
about having the US people come on the Bank premises -- we could have stopped them;&#13;
there was no legal reason they had to come or we had to receive them. We got a letter&#13;
from the Secretary of State -- when I say we, the president of the Bank got a letter from --&#13;
I think it was John Foster Dulles. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure, but Iâ&#128;&#153;m pretty sure it was Secretary of&#13;
State John Foster Dulles, who wrote a very stern letter, saying that if the Bank did not&#13;
cooperate in these investigations and allow the US investigators to come and interview&#13;
people in the Bank premises, dire consequences would follow. My memory is not very&#13;
precise about this, but they may have said, for example, that we wonâ&#128;&#153;t let you borrow any&#13;
more money, which means the Bank would have been in terrible trouble. So we decided&#13;
not to make a big fuss about it anymore, and we said, â&#128;&#156;Okay, you can come.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So it was a decision of prudence rather than a legal issue.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly. Yes. So they started to come, and they served interrogatories, it&#13;
was called in those days, on people they suspected of being â&#128;&#156;disloyal.â&#128;? And the&#13;
suspicions about disloyalty rose in connection with investigations being made of people if&#13;
the individual joined a left-wing organization or some nasty left-liberal organization.&#13;
They were crazy, the things they started to worry about. But they did. And once this got&#13;
to be known about what they were looking at and who was going to be getting&#13;
interrogatories, people started to worry.&#13;
&#13;
There was another man in the Bank, in the administration part of the Bank, by the name&#13;
of Francis Poore, who was a religious Catholic. And I was not a religious Catholic but I&#13;
was very much involved in all this. I was the main lawyer in connection with these&#13;
investigations. We tried to make sure that the procedures would be fair, that it be&#13;
unobtrusive, and that people would be handled correctly. It was interesting. As I say,&#13;
Poore was a conservative fellow, but he had had the same feeling I did about these things.&#13;
&#13;
Over time -- I remember there was one man. I forget his name. I thought Iâ&#128;&#153;d mention it&#13;
now. He was very concerned. He received an interrogatory. He was a very conservative&#13;
fellow. He was concerned that this was going to be the end of his career. A few people&#13;
felt that way. I think he ended up as president of a big bank. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember exactly.&#13;
But he was very upset about the fact that he was involved in this at all.&#13;
&#13;
There was one man I remember, not a lawyer, a young engineer, I think, or economist. I&#13;
forget what he was. He got an interrogatory and he came to see me. He said he was&#13;
going to quit the Bank because he had joined a communist party front or the communist&#13;
party when he was a young man. This would have been fifteen or twenty years before.&#13;
He did not want to embarrass the Bank by staying, so he quit. That was about the only&#13;
casualty as I remember of the Americans.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Do you recall the name of the second man, the one you just mentioned&#13;
who quit?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember his name. I donâ&#128;&#153;t. This is the sort of thing Iâ&#128;&#153;d find in my&#13;
files, because I used to write about all this stuff. But he quit and I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I ever knew&#13;
what happened to him after that. He was a very nice, able man, and Iâ&#128;&#153;m sorry he left. I&#13;
myself testified at some of these hearings on behalf of staffers whom I knew.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You were testifying in what -- before what committee or what&#13;
organization?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The US people would have little proceedings against certain individuals to&#13;
try to determine whether or not they should be particularly tough about dealing with&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Was this public testimony or was it --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: No, this was private. If they were regarded as disloyal, then I forget what the&#13;
consequences could have been -- you go to jail or you get thrown out. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what&#13;
happened to them, maybe lose their jobs if they were working for the United States, but&#13;
they werenâ&#128;&#153;t. Fortunately, the Bank never had to deal with the question of what would&#13;
happen if the United States said, â&#128;&#156;You are harboring somebody thatâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;disloyal,â&#128;&#153;â&#128;? what&#13;
we would have done. That never arose, so we didnâ&#128;&#153;t have to have that problem. They&#13;
did investigate people whom we were thinking of hiring, and that, too, could have been a&#13;
problem if we wanted to hire somebody and they say, â&#128;&#156;Donâ&#128;&#153;t hire him, heâ&#128;&#153;s a bad boy or&#13;
a bad girl.â&#128;? But that never happened either, as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
So the dire consequences -- we never had dire consequences. We worried a lot. People&#13;
worried a lot. But nothing much happened. This US procedure lasted for a while, but it&#13;
finally died down. I think it was rescinded. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think it exists anymore. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You mentioned hiring people, and youâ&#128;&#153;ve discussed a number of the&#13;
young lawyers that worked with you in previous sessions. How was hiring and recruiting&#13;
done in the legal division?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Nothing peculiar about it. In the early stages there werenâ&#128;&#152;t very many&#13;
lawyers anyway. There may have been ten, twelve lawyers for some years. I described&#13;
how I got a job. Chester McLain, who was the first general counsel, had contacts.&#13;
People would come to see us. We would get letters constantly about recommending&#13;
people. We were very careful about not just hiring somebody because some big shot said&#13;
we should take X. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t do that. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember any case that ever happened.&#13;
The Bank is very good about personnel. The result was we had people from all over the&#13;
world.&#13;
&#13;
As time went on and as the Bank expanded its operations, we felt that we had to expand&#13;
the kind of scope of our lawyers. So we got people in Europe, which, I think, the first&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
group of people we had were from Europe. We got a Frenchman, an Englishman, an&#13;
Italian, and then later a Cuban. We had no Japanese or Chinese for a while. That was a&#13;
problem. We finally hired a Japanese lawyer. That became a real big problem in the&#13;
Bank for personal reasons. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s another story.&#13;
&#13;
But let me digress for one minute. I found in my collection of papers a memorandum that&#13;
I wrote in connection with an investigation made in Japan about the early days of the&#13;
Bank in Japan. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll show you that after we get through with what Iâ&#128;&#153;m talking about now,&#13;
because it will be a brief account of some of the problems we had in Japan, which I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
think is in the archives either. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I have any more to say about the McCarthy&#13;
investigations unless you have some questions.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No. The era was roughly â&#128;&#152;50 to â&#128;&#152;53, â&#128;&#152;54, and McCarthy sort of burned&#13;
out publicly. That may be the reason the issue disappeared from the Bank. You&#13;
mentioned in the phone conversation we had that you wanted to talk about a young&#13;
lawyer, a German lawyer, who ended up moving on to found an international&#13;
organization.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. His name was Peter Eigen. He joined the Bank, and I forget when, not&#13;
very early days but shortly thereafter. He was a good lawyer. He was married,&#13;
incidentally, to a German lady who was a doctor. They were both active in Washington&#13;
life. He was a very able, gregarious man. He realized, as many of us did, the fact that&#13;
there was corruption all over the world. He decided that, as he saw it, he wanted to do&#13;
something about it. So after he had been at the Bank staff for several years -- this didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
happen overnight -- he decided to leave the Bank, establish something that he called&#13;
Transparency, Inc., which was simply an organization -- it was him at first -- which&#13;
would investigate the incidence of corruption in the developing world, and the developed&#13;
world to the extent it became relevant.&#13;
&#13;
Pretty soon -- he got money to do this from various sources. Pretty soon he was joined&#13;
by both -- by staffers from both the Bank and IFC who wanted to leave. Maybe they&#13;
were getting ready to retire anyway -- I donâ&#128;&#153;t recall -- because they didnâ&#128;&#153;t make any&#13;
money to speak of working with Transparency, Inc. So he had a staff of very&#13;
accomplished people, not a big staff, working on these problems. They developed&#13;
contacts really all over the developing world particularly to find out what was going on&#13;
for real. After a while, they would investigate these things. They would ask for reports&#13;
from people in the developing countries. They started to publish an index of corruption.&#13;
That index of corruption lists in order the most corrupt countries down to the least corrupt&#13;
countries, something that people watch a lot, used to anyway. I think they probably still&#13;
do. It was a very useful thing for Peter Eigen to do. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whatâ&#128;&#153;s happened to&#13;
him. As far as I know, heâ&#128;&#153;s still head of Transparency, Inc.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And he was drawing on his experience within the Bank and those who&#13;
came out to join him the same.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Sure. I remember -- getting ahead of myself for a moment -- in the Bretton&#13;
Woods agreement -- not the Bretton Woods agreement. In the Volta project agreement,&#13;
discussions, when I met Edgar Kaiser, the first thing he told me -- and this struck me a&#13;
little odd, but I realize now why -- he said, â&#128;&#156;I want you to know that we do not corrupt.&#13;
We do not pay anybody bribes to deal with what weâ&#128;&#153;re doing.â&#128;? Itâ&#128;&#153;s unusual for that to&#13;
happen, but I think you ought to know it. I was glad to hear it. I remember a lawyer who&#13;
went to Indonesia, for example, this was in the early days of the Bank. He came back&#13;
and told me, said, â&#128;&#156;We should not make any loans whatever to Indonesia. Itâ&#128;&#153;s just a&#13;
completely corrupt system. Donâ&#128;&#153;t do it.â&#128;? But we swallowed hard, but we did make loans&#13;
to a lot of places that were corrupt and probably may still be.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Dealing with systems that accept what we think of as corruption as a&#13;
part of their exchange and negotiation is a difficult proposition, I would think, for staffers&#13;
on an organization like the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. So itâ&#128;&#153;s a constant problem and a problem that the&#13;
Bank I know is concerned about now. But what theyâ&#128;&#153;re doing about it at the moment, I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t know.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You also mentioned in our conversation that you wanted to talk about&#13;
the Volta River project as an example of the sort of projects that the Bank got into. Do&#13;
you want to move to that?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Sure. The Volta River project was a remarkable project. It was the first big&#13;
project of its kind the Bank ever got involved in. It was a combination of public and&#13;
private financing. The project itself consisted of both the public part and a private part,&#13;
which I will describe in a moment. I read the summary of the agreements, which was&#13;
contained in archives. Itâ&#128;&#153;s about a half a page. Itâ&#128;&#153;s just a very bald summary of the main&#13;
agreements, how much money was involved. You read that, itâ&#128;&#153;s not that itâ&#128;&#153;s incorrect,&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s just completely incomplete. If you want to really know whatâ&#128;&#153;s going on, you canâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
tell anything by that.&#13;
&#13;
This was the first big dam project that the Bank financed. It was one of the biggest dam&#13;
projects in the world at that time. It created a lake which was, I think, the biggest lake&#13;
ever created by a dam. I canâ&#128;&#153;t believe this. I read 5,000 miles, I guess maybe with all the&#13;
streams and everything. I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t figure that one out.&#13;
&#13;
But in broad outline, let me just tell you what kind of a project it was, why it became so&#13;
difficult. Ghana was the home of the Volta River. That river was examined starting in&#13;
the early 1900s, 1915 maybe. People got the idea that the river could be dammed and&#13;
power generated and used for different purposes. Ghana was then the Gold Coast when it&#13;
was run by the UK. The British influence was obviously very strong in Ghana. The&#13;
Gold Coast became independent and became Ghana. The first president was [Kwame]&#13;
Nkrumah. Nkrumah was a very powerful fellow. He was regarded -- I think maybe he&#13;
regarded himself as sort of the leader of Africa in connection with the newly-emerging&#13;
countries in Africa in their relation to the Western countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And this decolonization of Africa was late â&#128;&#152;50s, early â&#128;&#152;60s.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The Volta agreements were signed in 1962, but we didnâ&#128;&#153;t start working on&#13;
those -- we started working on those several years earlier, maybe three or four years&#13;
earlier, because they were so complicated, which Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you about why in a minute. I&#13;
have some pictures, incidentally, if you want to see any.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That would be very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: If you want to see this. The whole thing was so interesting. The problem&#13;
was that although you could build a dam over the river, it was expensive -- a big river.&#13;
Ghana was poor. They couldnâ&#128;&#153;t afford it. IDA [International Development Association]&#13;
was not in existence then. The Bank was ready to, after it looked at it, ready to look&#13;
further into it, which it did. It was quickly realized that for the dam to be built there had&#13;
to be a consumer willing to buy the power. That turned out to be an aluminum smelter&#13;
company. The purpose, therefore, of the whole arrangement was that the dam would be&#13;
built to supply power, produce power for local people, and there would be assurances&#13;
from aluminum companies that they would buy the power over a long period of time,&#13;
because relatively small parts of it could be used at the time in Ghana. Over time it was&#13;
realized that more and more of it would be used in Ghana, but in the beginning relatively&#13;
little. So they had to make arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
The arrangements were, very briefly and broadly, to have agreements between the&#13;
government of Ghana and the consortium of aluminum companies, Valco [Volta&#13;
Aluminum Company], to deal with all these kinds of problems. Valco consisted finally&#13;
of only two aluminum companies. One was Kaiser Aluminum and the other was&#13;
Reynolds Aluminum. But the main player under Valco remained -- by far the biggest&#13;
share of it was held by Kaiser. They started working on this before the Bank got&#13;
involved.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank got involved a little later and started taking a look at the project, decided it was&#13;
worth examining, provided various conditions were satisfied. When the Bank got serious&#13;
about this, I was the lawyer on this and I went to Ghana. I found out in Ghana that the&#13;
Kaiser people were there. They had hired a California law firm. The guy from the&#13;
California law firm who had come there to work on all of this was a man by the name of&#13;
Ron Sullivan. They had already prepared and agreed on a preliminary basis of&#13;
understanding with Ghana about how the thing would work. I looked at that and I didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
like it. I had a lot of problems with it. I thought it was unfair, so I complained.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Unfair to whom?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: To Ghana. So I complained. I said, â&#128;&#156;No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t like this arrangement. You&#13;
have to change X or Y.â&#128;? So Sullivan and I did nothing but squabble. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know how&#13;
long it lasted that I was squabbling, but Edgar Kaiser was there and he realized that we&#13;
were not getting anywhere. We were just squabbling. So he called a guy he knew in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Washington, Lloyd Cutler, whom he knew from -- I donâ&#128;&#153;t know in what connection, but&#13;
he knew him. He asked Cutler to come over, and Cutler came over. He came to Ghana&#13;
with a colleague of his. Cutler was more reasonable, so we worked on this together off&#13;
and on for the next three or four years, trying to get these things agreed to. They were so&#13;
complicated.&#13;
&#13;
Whatâ&#128;&#153;s interesting is that Sullivan -- he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t fired. He was there, but he just had no&#13;
real power involved in representing that client of his, namely Kaiser. But he kept on&#13;
writing books about it, about that great project and about the great sterling work that he&#13;
did. [Laughter]. Books and law review [unclear]. It was kind of funny. I kind of liked&#13;
him, but he was not much of a power in handling all these negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
So we worked on these agreements. You had to arrange it so that the dam would be built,&#13;
the dam would produce the power, the aluminum companies would be obliged to buy the&#13;
power for long periods of time in order to make the project economically feasible. One&#13;
of the main problems arose simply because it took five years to build the dam [and] it&#13;
took two years to build the aluminum smelter. So if you built the dam and spent the&#13;
money to build the dam, how were you going to be sure that the smelter would be built?&#13;
In other words, you had to make arrangements at the very beginning as to how to handle&#13;
that. That got reflected in a series of agreements, which you donâ&#128;&#153;t want to hear about, to&#13;
take care of all the problems that all the parties had to deal with.&#13;
&#13;
On the Ghana side, on the government side, the financing was all governmental, public.&#13;
The United States -- Ex/Im Bank was involved, AID [Agency for International&#13;
Development] was involved, Development Loan Fund was involved. These were all&#13;
American government institutions. Ghana agreed to put in some money. The UK&#13;
development agency also agreed. So there were about five, as I recall, all contributing&#13;
donors, to the building of the dam.&#13;
&#13;
These were the negotiations that we had to have with them -- we, the Bank. Then on the&#13;
aluminum side -- as I say, there were Kaiser and Reynolds with Valco -- and we had to&#13;
deal with them on setting up all of these arrangements, because they wanted protection.&#13;
They wanted protection against what they called political risks, which they got, against&#13;
expropriation. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to be expropriated, so we had to define that. A whole&#13;
variety of things. Power rights had to be agreed on. Questions of exchange controls had&#13;
to be dealt with.&#13;
&#13;
I remember finally when we finished everything, we had a closing here in Washington. It&#13;
took us five hours just to sign the documents there were so many of them. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got&#13;
pictures around and Iâ&#128;&#153;ll show you. But there was so much stuff. Itâ&#128;&#153;s hard to imagine.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: How do you guarantee against political risks in a legal document?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: You have an agreement that just says essentially that. If there are political --&#13;
if something that we call or defined political risk happens, you get paid off or they wonâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
do it. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re in default.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So thereâ&#128;&#153;s a sort of compensation clause to cover extraordinary&#13;
developments on the legal side.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Institutions are designed, were designed, to take care of&#13;
handling of political risks. Let me see if I wrote notes. Let me see what else I should&#13;
say. Okay, let me start. Let me refine some of the things that I mentioned before just to&#13;
get the record more complete.&#13;
&#13;
The agreements were signed on February 8, 1962. The World Bank loaned $47 million&#13;
to the government of Ghana to cover the dam. $190 million was the estimated cost of the&#13;
dam and the power plant, which was at a place called Akosombo, fifty miles above the&#13;
mouth of the Volta River.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Akosombo is the name of the lake as well, I believe.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I forget. Studies, as I said, were started in 1915 and kept on being studied.&#13;
Originally it was because there was bauxite they thought they could use. However, that&#13;
disappeared from the scene. Kaiser got involved and in 1959 started to investigate the&#13;
project. Kaiser Engineering Company reviewed the project and decided it was&#13;
worthwhile to go further. They formed this Valco, which I mentioned before. It became&#13;
the primary goal of Nkrumah, this project. It was a very important thing for the country.&#13;
There were political problems and economic problems with the United States, because&#13;
Nkrumah was regarded as a socialist and a friend of the Soviets, so the US was leery&#13;
about getting involved in this at all. President Kennedy got involved and sent a special&#13;
mission to Ghana to study the matter. They realized that there was great excitement in&#13;
the country about the project, that it would be a test in a sense of the relation between&#13;
emerging Africa and the West. The power to be produced was to be twenty times more&#13;
power than Ghana then had. US took all those considerations into account and decided to&#13;
go further.&#13;
&#13;
Two agreements. One was a master agreement, the other was a power agreement, and&#13;
there were a lot of side agreements, but those were the two main agreements. The master&#13;
agreement was a concession contract essentially but a lot more. That provided that&#13;
Ghana would promise to build a dam, to set up a special authority, which the US and the&#13;
Bank were particularly interested in, a special authority to run the dam. The first head of&#13;
it was a Canadian. They would supply water and land and a port and labor facilities to&#13;
the smelter. The tax regime was fixed. The exchange controls were taken care of, no&#13;
expropriation, as I said -- all set off in a series of agreements. Valco promised to build a&#13;
smelter by a particular date. Also they agreed to fix prices for their smelter, adjusted for&#13;
inflation.&#13;
&#13;
The power contract provided that Ghana would supply the power for thirty years at a&#13;
fixed price, again adjustable. Valco agreed to either take it -- take the power or pay for&#13;
it. This is colloquially known as a take-or-pay contract, not unusual. Trust agreements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
were set up under which some of the moneys were set aside to be used only for certain&#13;
purposes. Political risk covered, as I say.&#13;
&#13;
One thing I did not mention was the fact that the project over time became very&#13;
controversial, not so much when it was originally financed, but later on a lot of criticism&#13;
was leveled at the project because of environmental reasons, particularly, and because&#13;
people were displaced and had to move elsewhere. The Bank did not get involved in&#13;
those matters to the extent it does now. We looked at them, as I remember, but only&#13;
briefly and broadly. We decided the project -- we realized the problems existed, but we&#13;
thought the project was so potentially useful, we went ahead with it. But as I say, the&#13;
criticisms have mounted over time, and itâ&#128;&#153;s been used as an example of the troubles that&#13;
you have when you build a big dam, the kinds of problems you have to deal with. And&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s still there. As far as I know, the project of the dam has turned out to be successful,&#13;
produces the power, the smelter is still there working away, they expanded the smelter.&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#153;s about it.&#13;
&#13;
But it gets back to where we started, in a way. The oral history program has very little&#13;
about the actual projects that the Bank is involved in. This is one example where I think&#13;
it would be useful to know about.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Indeed. I have a question about the context in which this came up. One&#13;
of the big international projects or potential projects was the construction in Egypt of the&#13;
Aswan Dam, which the United States refused to become involved in and supported&#13;
anyway. Was the Bank involved in that?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes, it was.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It was. But I can imagine that when in Africa the issue of another dam&#13;
which would do something similar to Aswan, that is, bring power and thereby economic&#13;
development to a country, came up, that there was some political influence about -- you&#13;
said that Kennedy became involved, sent a special commission, that there was some&#13;
suspicion but that the US government eventually supported the project. To what extent&#13;
was that, again, Cold War competition for Africa a factor in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s proceedings in all&#13;
of this? Did you feel that as a part of the whole atmosphere?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The Bank realized -- we werenâ&#128;&#153;t stupid. We werenâ&#128;&#153;t ignorant. We realized it&#13;
was an issue, but we went about our business in a very straightforward way. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think&#13;
this influenced -- it certainly didnâ&#128;&#153;t influence what I did. I was the lawyer mainly&#13;
responsible for all of these agreements, as far as the Bank was concerned. None of this&#13;
was any secret. [Interruption].&#13;
&#13;
These documents would be of interest. The Bank has probably got them.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Statement by the Government of Ghana, 25th of February, â&#128;&#152;61. So this&#13;
is a preliminary statement. This is something. And youâ&#128;&#153;ve got notes in here. This is&#13;
something the archives might actually want.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: They can have it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll bring that in to Jim Huttlinger and he can decide. The&#13;
interesting part of it is â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;m assuming that the handwritten comments and the typed&#13;
things in here derive from you in some way.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Probably. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what that is.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Volta River Project, Statement by the Government of Ghana. This is a&#13;
much smaller --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Maybe just extra copies. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This looks like the same.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I donâ&#128;&#153;t need to keep them anymore.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is a much briefer --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: This might be of some interest.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is a chart of the funding or of the support?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Of the funding for the project.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s very interesting, yes.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if you want this. I wrote a memorandum back in â&#128;&#152;66 about&#13;
legal problems of the Volta Dam. You can have that too if you like.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Good. January 1966. This is labeled â&#128;&#156;L. Rouse Jones.â&#128;? Who is&#13;
L. Rouse Jones?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Rouse Jones was the lawyer for Ghana. He was an English lawyer, and he&#13;
was seconded by England in some way but lived in Ghana. We became friends. Heâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
good fellow. Here are the pictures. Hereâ&#128;&#153;s Nkrumah. Hereâ&#128;&#153;s the US guy. Anyway, here&#13;
they are.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. I suspect the Bank would be very interested in these.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Really?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes, because one of the things thatâ&#128;&#153;s frequently missing in the archives&#13;
is photographs. Nkrumah -- this picture. Is that you in that picture in the center there?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s Edgar Kaiser.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Oh, thatâ&#128;&#153;s Edgar Kaiser. I wish I had some â&#128;&#156;Post-Itsâ&#128;? along. I would&#13;
mark that down.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Whatâ&#128;&#153;s the date of this? This may be of interest.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is 1967, an article entitled â&#128;&#156;West Africaâ&#128;&#153;s First Heavy Industry&#13;
Starts Up in Ghana; Volta Aluminum Company Runs Big Smelter. â&#128;? Iâ&#128;&#153;m looking at these&#13;
photographs and interested in having you identify people in here if you can. That one,&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;s a gentleman who is three-quarters turned away from the camera but whom you&#13;
may be able to identify.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: No, I cannot.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s fine.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let me see if I can identify anybody except Nkrumah.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a cleric in full garb.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. Maybe thatâ&#128;&#153;s Mrs. Nkrumah [unclear].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This looks just like a candid snapshot of a couple of people at the&#13;
ceremony.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. Right. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a picture of Nkrumah there. You saw that.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes. The picture of Nkrumah you had identified earlier. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s the&#13;
photograph of Nkrumah at the podium.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Edgar Kaiser is right in back of him. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the US guy there in back of&#13;
him. It doesnâ&#128;&#153;t say what this is all about.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: There is no information on the back. A couple of them have a stamp on&#13;
from the reproduction, but thatâ&#128;&#153;s all.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if this would be of any interest to you. There was a big, big&#13;
conference at Yale Law School. Well, you can see, itâ&#128;&#153;s Legal Problems in International&#13;
Financing. That included a session on the Volta project.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: March 1962.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right afterwards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The program is listed. Probably the interesting thing here would be that&#13;
there may be a lead to other documentation on this whole issue, so I will take that along,&#13;
too.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Okay. A thing you may want to use. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a memorandum here that I&#13;
prepared about the Volta, describing it. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s two copies. If youâ&#128;&#153;re interested, take&#13;
one of them.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Let me take a look. If you donâ&#128;&#153;t object, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll take the non-carbon-&#13;
copy and leave you that one.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is not dated on the front.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Iâ&#128;&#153;m surprised thereâ&#128;&#153;s no date on it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I donâ&#128;&#153;t see a date internally.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It must have been written shortly thereafter.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It looks like it must date from very early in the 1960s from the content&#13;
of it, entitled, â&#128;&#156;Volta.â&#128;? On the first page, two major topics, â&#128;&#156;Introductionâ&#128;? and&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Background.â&#128;? Then it goes on. The total number of pages is nine. Yes, I will take that&#13;
along. Are there other things about the Volta River project that you want to add?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think so. I think Iâ&#128;&#153;ve said [enough].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: All right. You did just mention the issue of immunities, which is one of&#13;
the things youâ&#128;&#153;ve suggested is worth talking about and exploring. Do you want to do that&#13;
this morning or leave that to another time?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a tremendous topic. Three or four years ago I was asked by the&#13;
general counsel of IFC to give them a survey of where they and also where the Bank&#13;
stood on the issue of immunities. I spent a month working on this, and I finally ended up&#13;
making a presentation to the Bank, to the IFC lawyers and the Bank lawyers -- there must&#13;
have been about fifty of them -- bringing up to date the issues on immunities.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What is the issue on immunities? Can you describe that to someone&#13;
who really isnâ&#128;&#153;t familiar with the whole situation?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The issue on immunities is very complicated and it arises in many different&#13;
ways.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: These are diplomatic immunities for personnel?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: No, these are legal immunities or the absence of legal immunities. The&#13;
problem is, for the Bank and IFC, that they combine both public and private aspects of&#13;
their work, so that the immunities differ depending on what theyâ&#128;&#153;re doing. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no&#13;
end to the problems that we had to face over the years dealing with those kinds of issues.&#13;
I think if itâ&#128;&#153;s something of interest -- I think it is of interest -- what I would do for the&#13;
next session is go through some of this stuff and try to put it in some comprehensive way&#13;
that would make some sense for you people.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That would be interesting.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: There are two volumes over there. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got so much stuff on it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Do you have the memorandum that you prepared for the IFC?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I have an outline of it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You have an outline of it.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: And the Bank never gave me, to my -- maybe you can -- maybe Jim can get&#13;
it. I never got a copy of the statement I made. They taped it but I never got a copy of it.&#13;
They kept on telling me, â&#128;&#156;Somebody else did it -- has it. I donâ&#128;&#153;t have it.â&#128;? But I think it&#13;
might be useful.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A; Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: -- just to summarize it best I can.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It seems to me it would be. You have submitted some written material&#13;
to the Bank, and you gave this presentation on it, so they may have that. But Iâ&#128;&#153;ll check&#13;
with Jim Huttlinger.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let me know, will you?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I certainly will.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Otherwise I can take what Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got and do the best I can with it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You mentioned in one of our early conversations Dick Richards as&#13;
general counsel of IFC. You said, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you about that. Itâ&#128;&#153;s an interesting story.â&#128;? Is&#13;
that something you want to talk about today?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I can. Sure. What happened was when IFC started, Robert Garner became&#13;
president of IFC. He had been a vice president of the Bank, and he was one of the three&#13;
New York bankers who came down to run the Bank -- two bankers and a lawyer. John&#13;
McCloy was a lawyer but very much involved in banking. Bob Garner was an executive&#13;
of Guaranty Trust, I believe, and Eugene Black, who was with Chase. They came down&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and they ran the Bank. After a while they realized that they should establish another&#13;
institution which could deal with private investment. There was consideration given to&#13;
having that as an affiliate of the Bank, but it was decided after a while that that would not&#13;
be useful because it would only distort what the Bank would be doing. So after a lot of&#13;
discussion -- this is a very brief summary of a lot of discussion -- it was decided that there&#13;
should be a separate institution. So the IFC was started.&#13;
&#13;
I was then on the Bank legal staff. I think I was maybe deputy general counsel. I was&#13;
charged with writing the charter for the IFC, and I did. I worked on the charter and&#13;
whatever rules of procedure we needed in order to get started. It required a certain&#13;
number of acceptances and a certain amount of money of governments to start the IFC in&#13;
operation, which we got. When it started business, I was assigned to be full-time at IFC.&#13;
I was still on the Bank staff but I was assigned to work as an IFC lawyer, which I did for&#13;
several years. I had working with me Dick Richards, who was a Bank lawyer. He and&#13;
Claude Kaufmann, who was the Brazilian I mentioned, and Jean Blondiel was the&#13;
Belgian I mentioned. There were four of us essentially. [We] handled IFC work. We&#13;
were the IFC lawyers, but we had all come from the Bank staff.&#13;
&#13;
The general counsel of the Bank was this Dutchman, [Aron] Broches. He and Garner did&#13;
not get along. Garner didnâ&#128;&#153;t like him and Broches didnâ&#128;&#153;t like Garner. I got along fine&#13;
with Garner, and I liked the work of the IFC. I thought it was very interesting. So I&#13;
worked with IFC for about three years. Finally Garner got angry enough at Broches [that]&#13;
he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want Broches to have anything to do with what he was doing. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t get&#13;
involved much anyway. But he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to have him involved at all. So he wanted to&#13;
establish his own legal department, and he asked me to become general counsel of the&#13;
legal department. I was very tempted because I liked the work of IFC. But Gene Black,&#13;
who was president of the Bank at the time, found about this offer to me, and he told me,&#13;
he said, â&#128;?Please donâ&#128;&#153;t go. I want you to stay in the Bank.â&#128;? And I liked the Bank, so I&#13;
stayed at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
They needed a general counsel, and so Dick Richards, who was an English lawyer, a very&#13;
good lawyer for one of the big English law firms, became general counsel. He was&#13;
general counsel for some years. Broches was furious. He called Dick Richards a traitor&#13;
for leaving the Bank that way. But Dick Richards, it seems to me, was perfectly proper&#13;
in dealing with it the way he did. He was a fine lawyer. The IFC went about its business&#13;
and had its own legal department, and that was it. I went back to the Bank and did the&#13;
Bank work.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So once Richards took over and this sort of reorganization took place,&#13;
you were no longer working with IFC. You came back.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: We worked together on stuff but I was not part of the IFC apparatus any&#13;
longer.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You were no longer assigned to that as a major responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right. And one of the things I donâ&#128;&#153;t think we talked about is the fact that it&#13;
came to be realized, maybe after a while, that it was silly for the Bank and IFC to be so&#13;
separate. The Bank has started to establish little committee groups, joint Bank and IFC&#13;
on special matters. How thatâ&#128;&#153;s working out, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know, but itâ&#128;&#153;s a useful thing to do.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This was started in relation to IFC when this reorganization took place?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It was realized that it was stupid to be so separate. The same with the&#13;
International Monetary Fund. We started having â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure I mentioned this. We&#13;
started having monthly lunches.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You did mention that.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: That was all part of the same problem, getting together.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Can you date those monthly lunches, because that sounded to me like a&#13;
really good idea.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember them. They went on for years, I know. When they first&#13;
started, I donâ&#128;&#153;t recall.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I wonder if it was in this period in the â&#128;&#152;50s. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll have to track it.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Probably not in the â&#128;&#152;50s, but maybe. But then, as I said, when Shihata came,&#13;
he stopped it. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to spend the money for the lunches, which we paid for it.&#13;
[Laughter].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Well, I have run out of topics for this morning.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let me mention one other thing and see if you want me to talk about it at all.&#13;
In â&#128;&#152;98 I got a letter from the head of the World Bank office in Tokyo saying that the&#13;
Japanese were very much interested in the early relations between the Bank and Japan.&#13;
Let me just read you his letter. He wrote me a letter. He recalls that Japan borrowed&#13;
some money for an expressway. It was its fifth expressway project in 1965 and they&#13;
were paying it off. He says, â&#128;&#156;The last repayment is due this year, and this marks the end&#13;
of the relationship between the Bank as lender and Japan as a borrower. We feel that this&#13;
is an excellent opportunity to renew peopleâ&#128;&#153;s understanding of the evolving relationship&#13;
between the Bank and Japan over the past forty years and to establish a more lively&#13;
interest in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s operations,â&#128;? et cetera. So theyâ&#128;&#153;re preparing papers to deal with all&#13;
that and they wrote me to see what I could say about the history of all of this.&#13;
&#13;
I responded, and I have a letter which I sent him. You may want to -- I can tell you a&#13;
little more about it, but it might be useful for the archives.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes, indeed. The letter is dated June 4th, 1990.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It goes back to the days when I was involved in Japan, both on the borrowing&#13;
and on the lending side, first lending. We loaned money at first to Japan, and after Japan&#13;
got richer, we started to borrow money from Japan. I was a lawyer on both aspects of our&#13;
relationship.&#13;
&#13;
But one of the things that youâ&#128;&#153;ll see in that letter that I wrote back to him -- I didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
mention this, but Japan was completely different in those days than they are now.&#13;
Theyâ&#128;&#153;re now like us, like the United States. In those days they had no lawyers to deal&#13;
with hardly. They had no contacts with the United States or with Western Europe. When&#13;
I went there, I remember, we hired an American -- a big Japanese law firm. The Japanese&#13;
partner working with me on the matter got involved in negotiations about how to&#13;
proceed. A tax problem came up. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll never forget this. A tax problem came up, and he&#13;
said to me, â&#128;&#156;Write a letter to my tax partner.â&#128;? I said, â&#128;&#156;No. Youâ&#128;&#153;re supposed to be in&#13;
charge of this. You write a letter to your own tax partner.â&#128;? Anyway, the result of it is I&#13;
fired the Japanese firm. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a Japanese firm representing us anymore.&#13;
&#13;
What happened is I would call up somebody in the Ministry of Finance whom we dealt&#13;
with, raising an issue. Heâ&#128;&#153;d say, ?Wait a minute.? Then he would get maybe five or six&#13;
people on the telephone, and we would discuss the issue all together. We would agree on&#13;
something, and that would be it. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way we dealt, period, piece after piece. It&#13;
worked fine. But as this letter that you havenâ&#128;&#153;t read says, ?The Japanese didnâ&#128;&#153;t believe in&#13;
those days.? They didnâ&#128;&#153;t know anything about these complicated arrangements that the&#13;
Americans liked to make sure that things were done or not done. There it was done by&#13;
mutual agreement. People agreed and they didnâ&#128;&#153;t expect to sue each other. Now itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
different.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And these were verbal agreements.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Did somebody write a memorandum after the conversation?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I used to write memoranda, sure. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure the Japanese did, but I Did.&#13;
Things worked fine. Now itâ&#128;&#153;s altogether different.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Different cultural traditions and legal traditions.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: So thatâ&#128;&#153;s all yours if you want it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I will take that and add it -- give it to Jim Huttlinger and add it to the&#13;
collection, yes.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Okay. Fine.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So youâ&#128;&#153;ve continued to work on this material well into the end of the&#13;
century.&#13;

NURICK: I kept on getting problems all the time dealing with the Bank and IFC in the&#13;
early days, Bank and IDA. I did until I quit.&#13;

GRATHWOL: Very good. I think we can stop here.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Quit. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Unless you have other things you want to say.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s enough. [Laughter].&#13;

&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is an interview with Lester Nurick, conducted in his home in&#13;
Potomac, Maryland, on April the 7th, 2004. The interviewer is Robert P. Grathwol, and&#13;
the interview is part of a series of oral history interviews for the World Bank. This is&#13;
tape one, side one.&#13;
&#13;
Lester, you said you wanted to start with the Arab boycott this morning.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s fine. The term â&#128;?Arab boycottâ&#128;? covers a lot of things, but let me start&#13;
by telling you what I remember, anyway. I went to the Bank and looked at the files that I&#13;
left with the Bank dealing with the Arab boycott, and most of the material goes back to&#13;
1976 and 1977.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Let me ask you at the start, all of this grows out of the Yom Kippur War&#13;
and the subsequent boycott by the Arabs of -- or the embargo on oil shipments to the&#13;
West. Then the reaction to that â&#128;&#147; itâ&#128;&#153;s the legal situation that companies that might be&#13;
dealing in contradiction to the Arab desire to exclude Israel from all of this. This is the&#13;
sort of legal context, is it not?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s correct. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s correct.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Let me ask you, what was the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s relationship with the Arab world&#13;
before the Yom Kippur War? Were there loans to Arab countries?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: There were loans to Arab countries. And, as I will mention later, we had&#13;
several Arab lawyers. They came from different Arab countries. My recollection is that&#13;
they were fine. We had no particular problems with them, except that it was a very&#13;
troublesome part of the world always.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Indeed.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The relationship of the Bank to this issue arose primarily because of&#13;
Congressman David Obey. Heâ&#128;&#153;s a congressman from the middle west, and heâ&#128;&#153;s still in&#13;
congress. He was an influential congressman then; he still is. Heâ&#128;&#153;s on a committee&#13;
which is involved with Bank affairs. He got interested in it very much so, and he thought&#13;
that the Bank was taking a position to favor the Arab boycott. He was concerned about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s position. The Bank -- there was much going on internally in the Bank about&#13;
how to deal with this, because under normal Bank rules, several things happen. First of&#13;
all, contracts usually are subject to local law, to begin with. If local law includes the&#13;
Arab boycott, then weâ&#128;&#153;ve got a problem. Secondly, the Bank is interested in having&#13;
procurement at the lowest possible price, competitive price. How do you reconcile all&#13;
these things? Itâ&#128;&#153;s not easy.&#13;
&#13;
After much deliberation, the Bank decided that the wise thing for it to do would be to&#13;
recognize -- allow what was called the â&#128;&#156;primary boycottâ&#128;? and not allow a â&#128;&#156;secondary&#13;
boycott.â&#128;? Now, a primary boycott is where a country refuses to allow anybody in the&#13;
country to have commercial relationships with another country -- in other words, like as&#13;
if you were in a war. So Country A does not allow its people to deal with Country B.&#13;
The Bank allows that, unless it results in ineffective competition, which it has to decide.&#13;
&#13;
However, it does not allow what they call a secondary boycott. And a secondary boycott&#13;
is where a country does not allow a contractor to be involved in a project who comes&#13;
from a third country -- in other words, somebody not affected by the primary boycott but&#13;
where some contractor wants to contract, say, with an Israeli company to do&#13;
subcontracting. That the Bank does not allow. In other words, itâ&#128;&#153;s various tiers of&#13;
contracting, and the Bank will allow the first tier, the primary boycott, and not allow the&#13;
second tier, the secondary boycott.&#13;
&#13;
That, of course, was one of the main issues as to the effect of doing that in the Arab&#13;
countries and the relationship of the Bank to its countries, to the United States, and&#13;
others.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And all of this, as I understand it, was the Arab countries? effort to use&#13;
their economic strength, their oil, to put pressure on great powers or trading powers to&#13;
exclude Israel from commercial transactions. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, sure. I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s exactly right. Now, in doing this -- this is&#13;
one of the interesting things about the Bank. In doing this, we looked at all the laws of&#13;
all the Arab countries, the boycott laws. To do that, we had several Arab lawyers. We&#13;
had Egyptian lawyers, as I remember it, several Egyptian lawyers. We had a Lebanese&#13;
lawyer, other people who were able to deal -- translate, of course, for us, the rest of us&#13;
who didnâ&#128;&#153;t know the language -- and tell us what was in the various laws so we knew&#13;
what the laws were that we had to confront. My guess is nobody else could have done&#13;
that as well as these people. They did a very professional job. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t have any axes&#13;
to grind. They were like other people in the Bank. They did their homework and they did&#13;
it very professionally.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What was your relationship to these people who were working on&#13;
translating and identifying and defining the local law?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: At that time I was -- then I guess I was assistant general counsel, and so I was&#13;
very much involved in all of this stuff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Youâ&#128;&#153;re at a sort of supervisory, manager level over this effort.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Incidentally, the Arab boycott, while that particular&#13;
set of problems was for the Arab countries, the same kinds of problems were always with&#13;
other countries that did the same kind of thing. The notes I had included references to&#13;
Rhodesia, India, Pakistan, South Africa. All, and others too, I think, had laws like the&#13;
Arab boycott laws. So we had to deal with that as well. We also looked at the rules of&#13;
the US organizations, like the AID [Agency for International Development], the&#13;
Export/Import Bank, and OPIC(OPIC), and similar institutions in other developed&#13;
countries, to see with how they dealt with these kinds of problems.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: OPIC -- can you identify OPIC [Overseas Private Investment&#13;
Corporation] for me?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It was one of the major institutions.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Itâ&#128;&#153;s a US institution.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: US(OPIC) institution, right. What I donâ&#128;&#153;t know anymore is whether it is still&#13;
an issue in the Bank. In the 70s, as I say, it was a big issue, burning issue. But I havenâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
heard about it lately, so maybe itâ&#128;&#153;s disappeared or maybe things have calmed down. I&#13;
just donâ&#128;&#153;t know.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I canâ&#128;&#153;t answer that for you.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: You canâ&#128;&#153;t answer it either. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s all I can tell you about it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So once you have defined the local law, the Arab law that governs&#13;
contracts and that governs relationships, how did the Bank proceed?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It had to proceed in several directions. It had to proceed to see whether or&#13;
not it involved the attempted application of a secondary boycott, which it would not&#13;
allow. And secondly, it allowed effective international competition. It had to make these&#13;
decisions, like it does all the time.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Were there major issues or incidents that affected the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s operation&#13;
that grew out of this?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I think there were, but I canâ&#128;&#153;t tell you anymore what they were. There were&#13;
personnel questions. As I remember it, there were questions about who could be hired,&#13;
what kind of people would have to be hired or not hired.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: In the Bank itself or with --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Not in the Bank. The Bank had to make decisions itself that it would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
not be affected by any of this. We would hire the best people we could get, period.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see. But then youâ&#128;&#153;re talking about who contractors could hire.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. We got involved in that, too, as well. But, as I say,&#13;
the issue dried up. After the 1970s, I remember very little about it happening.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So in that sense, perhaps the Bank found a successful way to navigate&#13;
this situation.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I think we did. I think we probably did.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of the issues that came up in that period, according to things that&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;ve looked at, was the rehabilitation of the Suez Canal after the Yom Kippur War. Was&#13;
the Bank involved in that?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The Bank was involved in that. That was a very interesting affair also, but&#13;
my recollection of that is scarce. I was involved in that as well, but Iâ&#128;&#153;d have to look at&#13;
my notes to tell you much more about it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Did this situation, the issue of the boycott, affect, change, or in what&#13;
ways did it change or affect the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s relationship with individual Arab countries, say&#13;
Syria or Iraq or Jordan? Are there issues there that you recall?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: No.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. I have a note here about an Arab boycott clause. Does that mean&#13;
anything to you? Was that written into contracts?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s the kind of clause I was talking about before, the primary&#13;
boycott law.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see. Okay. All right then. Another major issue that came up in this&#13;
same period, the early 70s, was the situation of China, or ?the two Chinas? I suppose one&#13;
could say. Do you want to move on to that?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: All right. Letâ&#128;&#153;s talk about China, which is also a very interesting subject all&#13;
around. China -- quote â&#128;&#156;Chinaâ&#128;? -- was one of the founding fathers of the World Bank. In&#13;
other words, at the Bretton Woods Conference, China became a member. Taiwan, after a&#13;
period -- I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what the timing involved there was. But after a while, Taiwan&#13;
came to represent China. China, as far as we were concerned, was handled by China, in&#13;
other words. But Taiwan was China. So we dealt with Taiwan as China. We made&#13;
investments in Taiwan. We operated with them pretty much like we would with anybody&#13;
else. They had a representative on the board of the Bank, Martin Wong. He and I&#13;
became friends. As a matter of fact, we used to play bridge together and we socialized&#13;
together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I used to go to his house for meals. The best food I ever ate in my life I had at Marty&#13;
Wongâ&#128;&#153;s house. He was very much the epicure. His wife did all the cooking and he did&#13;
all the talking. But he was a very able guy.&#13;
&#13;
But that lasted until 1980, when the PRC, the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Republic of China, assumed the&#13;
role of China in the Bank, succeeding Taiwan. At that point, they started raising&#13;
questions about the size of their capital subscription, the voting structure, their&#13;
membership in the board, things like that. Those issues were considered and dealt with&#13;
over the years. It finally calmed down. But when the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Republic became the&#13;
member, we had to deal with them instead of Taiwan.&#13;
&#13;
One of the things we had to do, incidentally, was to find a lawyer who knew Chinese.&#13;
We could not find a Chinese-speaking lawyer. It was very difficult. We finally did find&#13;
one. It turned out to be an American who studied in China, a woman. She was working&#13;
in the US Treasury Department, as a matter of fact. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t even know they had a&#13;
Chinese expert on the staff. We hired her. Sheâ&#128;&#153;s still there. As a matter of fact, she&#13;
married a Chinese. She used to tell me that sheâ&#128;&#153;d go to a Chinese restaurant, and she&#13;
would order food in Chinese, and the waiter would assume he was talking. [Laughter].&#13;
The husband was Chinese but didnâ&#128;&#153;t know how to speak Chinese. It was very interesting&#13;
all around.&#13;
&#13;
I went to -- when this happened, and Marty Wong then became the representative -- not&#13;
the ambassador but the representative of Taiwan in the United States -- I started dealing&#13;
with him for Taiwan. Finally, after a couple of years, I went to Taiwan with him to&#13;
negotiate the terms of their dealing with us. We made a deal, and the deal essentially was&#13;
that Taiwan would continue to recognize its debts to the Bank, which they did. That was&#13;
about it.&#13;
&#13;
Also around the same time, I was -- when China got involved in the operations of the&#13;
Bank and started to develop industrially, I was asked by the United Nations to go to&#13;
China and talk to the Chinese about how to deal with their international projects, which I&#13;
did. I have extensive notes on the lectures I gave. I was there about a week. There were&#13;
about a hundred Chinese, partly government people and partly private contracting people,&#13;
who wanted to know how to deal with things. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a clue about any of this.&#13;
So I went there, as I say, and I gave lectures about all of this, and they were interested in&#13;
the rules of the World Bank, the rules of other international organizations, how to deal&#13;
with procurement questions, how to deal with insurance questions, and what were the&#13;
risks involved, the kind of questions that any neophyte would want to know who has to&#13;
and wants to deal with international affairs. It was all very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOLl: Were you still at the Bank when you took on this UN assignment?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: No, this was later.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This was after â&#128;&#152;82 then.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. It was the early â&#128;&#152;80s when I left the Bank. But I was asked to&#13;
go by the UN because of my affiliation.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Certainly. You have a long history with the Bank and a lot of&#13;
knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Letâ&#128;&#153;s see if thereâ&#128;&#153;s anything else I left out.&#13;
&#13;
Incidentally, they were also interested in the Arab boycott.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s one of the questions they raised with me.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: How the Bank dealt with the Arab boycott?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: "What do you do about the Arab boycott?â&#128;? So I guess they were mad at&#13;
somebody. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of the issues that I ran across in looking at the papers in the Bank&#13;
was the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s approach to this not as a membership issue but as a representation issue.&#13;
You started out by saying, â&#128;&#156;China was a founding member,â&#128;? without distinguishing&#13;
which China or what kind of China. Can you talk about that a little bit?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. My recollection is just what you said, that China became a&#13;
member but that Taiwan -- the US and other countries didnâ&#128;&#153;t get along with China very&#13;
well, so China became Taiwan. I was involved in all that. Just how it all happened, I&#13;
canâ&#128;&#153;t tell you anymore. But youâ&#128;&#153;re right. It was a representation issue.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes. And the membership issue would have meant somehow that there&#13;
were two Chinas, which was something that the Bank did not want to acknowledge.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly. I remember Marty Wong used to tell me, once Taiwan got involved&#13;
in all this, he said, â&#128;&#156;This is going to be a major problem for the US and other countries&#13;
years to come.â&#128;? He was absolutely right, just like it is now.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This was -- McNamara was the president at this time. How was he&#13;
involved in this? Was he directly involved, or did he simply take over the work that the&#13;
legal department had done and present it to the board, to the executive directors?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: He didnâ&#128;&#153;t get much involved in what I was doing. I can talk about&#13;
McNamara as president a little later if you ask me to.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I would like that, but letâ&#128;&#153;s leave that apart from this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         62&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: But nothing special. Obviously, they were very interested in all of this&#13;
because it was so important.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But itâ&#128;&#153;s not that he was the driving force in this. It was the course of&#13;
events around.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I have anything more to say about China.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Then I think it would be a plus for the record if we spend some&#13;
time talking about the presidents and your personal awareness of them at the level at&#13;
which you were working. You started out as a relatively young lawyer, although you&#13;
were in your thirties already when you started at the Bank, as I recall. So you lived with&#13;
and lived through a lot of presidential changes. Let me just run through the names and&#13;
you react to them as you remember them. John J. McCloy youâ&#128;&#153;ve spoken about.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let me interrupt you a minute, because when I was hired, the president was&#13;
Eugene Meyer. Meyer wasnâ&#128;&#153;t president for very long -- about six months, I think. Let&#13;
me say a word about Meyer. Meyer was president of a big company. He had political&#13;
connections, obviously. He bought The Washington Post at some point. But he became&#13;
the first president of the World Bank. It was interesting, because he was an ex-big-shot&#13;
businessman, also interested in world affairs. But he became president. And while he&#13;
did not get involved in operations as such, he did get involved in structural organization.&#13;
&#13;
Now, when I was hired, I was interviewed and hired, essentially, by the general counsel,&#13;
whom Iâ&#128;&#153;ll talk about in a minute, Chester McLain. But after McLain got finished with&#13;
me, he said, â&#128;&#156;I want to introduce you to the president, because heâ&#128;&#153;s the president and he&#13;
has to finally approve your appointment.â&#128;? I said, â&#128;&#156;Fine.â&#128;? So I went in to see Meyer and I&#13;
spent about an hour with him. But he asked -- I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember that he asked me any&#13;
questions. He just talked about things generally himself. When we were all finished, he&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;Okay, fine.â&#128;? And that was it, and I was hired. But I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I ever had anything&#13;
more to do with him after that. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t stay very long.&#13;
&#13;
But what he did do was to bring in or help bring in the people that ran the Bank. One of&#13;
them was the general counsel, Chester McLain, who was an old Cravath partner. His old&#13;
firm had used Cravath as a law firm. It was a highly-regarded, prestigious law firm.&#13;
John McCloy had been a partner in that firm, as well. So, in a sense, Cravath ran the&#13;
Bank in the early days, because McLain was very instrumental in the affairs of the Bank&#13;
and keeping the Bank on an even keel.&#13;
&#13;
Then Meyer left. Letâ&#128;&#153;s see if I have anything more to say about Meyer. [Pause]. Well,&#13;
let me just add to what I said about his role in structuring the Bank. He hired or arranged&#13;
for the hiring of some very important people in the Bank, who were all businessmen, all&#13;
bankers, and very much of the same ilk. They all turned out to be experienced&#13;
businessmen but into good proper international civil servants. They did not favor their&#13;
friends, their relatives, hardly at all. Once in a while they might have hired somebody&#13;
who was a friend or a relative, but on the whole, they conducted themselves absolutely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
admirably, I thought. People like Eugene Black, who later became president; Robert&#13;
Garner, who became the head vice president for a while and then the president of IFC, the&#13;
only president IFC ever had; and then John McCloy came in; and then Gene Black -- all&#13;
part of the same kind of people.&#13;
&#13;
So in that sense, Meyer left a very indelible impression on the future of the Bank, and a&#13;
very good one. But he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t there very long.&#13;
&#13;
Then John McCloy succeeded him. He had been, as I said, a Cravath partner, but he had&#13;
also been assistant Secretary of War or Defense, I forget what it was called.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Secretary of War at that time.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I think it was Secretary of War. He came in. He was president of the Bank.&#13;
He came in, as I said, together with McLain. The two of them were the essential&#13;
powerhouses in the Bank structure, I think, at the time. They organized the different&#13;
committees and how the Bank would proceed. One of the things that weâ&#128;&#153;ve talked about&#13;
before is the relationship of the president of the Bank to the board -- who would deal with&#13;
the loans.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Youâ&#128;&#153;ve mentioned something in talking about that. You said that there&#13;
was a sort of negotiated arrangement between the executive directors and the president&#13;
when McCloy came in. You said that you carried around with you to every meeting a&#13;
copy of the document that outlined that.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I still have it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Oh, you still have it?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I can show it to you.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a very important document. I would like to see that retired to the&#13;
Bank if they donâ&#128;&#153;t have a copy of it.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, itâ&#128;&#153;s interesting. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember anybody ever having seen a copy of&#13;
this except me. I took it to every single meeting, and I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I ever had occasion to&#13;
use it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what you said earlier. But itâ&#128;&#153;s important that you carried it, that&#13;
you had it on hand should anything come up.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let me see if I can find it right now.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Hang on a second, then. [Interruption]. We have moved over to the&#13;
table where you have documents spread out, and you have found the document that we&#13;
were talking about.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The document is entitled, â&#128;&#156;Organization and Loan Procedure.â&#128;? Itâ&#128;&#153;s dated&#13;
May 22nd, 1947. This was the result of negotiations between John McCloy and the&#13;
board, essentially, as to who would do what, because there was a big fuss about that,&#13;
especially by the United States? director, a man by the name of [Emilio] Collado. But the&#13;
document that finally resulted said that the executive directors would be responsible for&#13;
matters of policy, and the president would be responsible for managing. As far as loans&#13;
were concerned, the president would decide whether to make a loan or not to make a&#13;
loan, but in either case keep the executive directors advised. But the president would&#13;
have the final word about whether or not to make a loan. If he decided to make a loan,&#13;
the directors would approve it and that would be it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So decision-making power lay with the president.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Decision-making power lay with the president but subject to the approval of&#13;
the board. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way itâ&#128;&#153;s worked over the years. And as I told you, I had this&#13;
document with me every time I went to a board meeting, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember that&#13;
anybody ever referred to it after those early days, after the issues that this dealt with&#13;
finally sort of calmed down. But they didnâ&#128;&#153;t completely calm down, because every once&#13;
in a while the same issue arises -- namely, whoâ&#128;&#153;s responsible for things? This is the big&#13;
fuss there was involving George Woods, which I mentioned before.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Right. You mentioned that before.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Who decides matters of policy? What are matters of policy? Thatâ&#128;&#153;s still an&#13;
issue in the Bank. This memorandum of 1947 was revised by another memorandum&#13;
dated September 14, 1956. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll give you this as well. You can have them both. These&#13;
are in archives, if anybody can ever find them.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Well, I think itâ&#128;&#153;s useful to have them mentioned in the oral history&#13;
because that will alert someone to go looking for the document. And if theyâ&#128;&#153;re retired as&#13;
a part of the things that youâ&#128;&#153;re retiring at this point, it may be easier to locate them in the&#13;
archives. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s excellent. Thank you. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a document that is multi-paged, it looks like.&#13;
About five pages and then thereâ&#128;&#153;s an attachment, so it goes on for another -- so itâ&#128;&#153;s not a&#13;
one-page document. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a several-page exploration of what the board had agreed to&#13;
essentially when McCloy agreed to take the position as president.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Then the revision in September of 1956 is also a multi-page document.&#13;
It looks like five pages. So thereâ&#128;&#153;s a substantial amount of information in each of these.&#13;
Thank you very much. Do you want to stay here or go back?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Why donâ&#128;&#153;t I stay here? Let me talk about the presidents here. Can you give&#13;
me my --&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I can. Just a moment. [Interruption].&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think there is anything more I need to say about Eugene Meyer. Let&#13;
me turn now to McCloy. As I say, McCloy came in after about six months when Meyer&#13;
left. He was responsible for the organization of the Bank in those days. He decided what&#13;
committees there ought to be, how things ought to be divided, and he oversaw the early&#13;
loans of the bank, in connection mostly with the Marshall Plan. The Bank was very&#13;
much involved in the Marshall Plan. I happened to be the lawyer on most of those loans&#13;
myself, so I worked with them.&#13;
&#13;
He was a very businesslike, orderly fellow. As I say, [he] worked very closely with&#13;
Chester McLain. They put the Bank, I think, on a very proper track in those days. He&#13;
left to become High Commissioner in Germany. I forget what that was called, some kind&#13;
of high --&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: High Commissioner. That was the title.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: High Commissioner of something. McLain left also to become his general&#13;
counsel, so the two of them left. The interesting thing, the personal thing, was that during&#13;
the war -- this has nothing to do with the Bank really, except I dealt with McCloy on a&#13;
matter, a very important matter when I was chief of the international law division of the&#13;
army. Dave Sommers, who became the general counsel succeeding McLain, was&#13;
McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s deputy in those days. So I dealt with both of them, as a matter of fact. There&#13;
are some very funny stories I could tell you later. Anyway, that was Cravath. That was&#13;
McCloy.&#13;
&#13;
McCloy was succeeded by Eugene Black. They were all friends. Black was a very&#13;
interesting fellow. He was a southerner who moved up to New York. He was part of a&#13;
well-known southern family. He moved up to New York and became a senior person in&#13;
one of the big New York banks. He was president for about -- like McNamara -- about&#13;
thirteen years or something like that. I forget exactly.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: â&#128;&#152;49 to â&#128;&#152;62.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Is that it?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Good for you.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thirteen years.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: And I worked, as a matter of fact -- I donâ&#128;&#153;t know why it happened -- but I&#13;
worked pretty closely with Black. He got me involved in various things. He asked me to&#13;
write and help him write some speeches, which I did. So I got to know him pretty well,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and he was a very interesting, very able, smart man. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t get involved in details&#13;
particularly; he left those to his vice presidents, his deputies, to others.&#13;
&#13;
Like all presidents, most all presidents, he was very objective about the work of the&#13;
Bank. He was a very good fellow. He was a baseball fan, so as soon as it became known&#13;
he was a baseball fan, everybody in the staff decided to become baseball fans.&#13;
[Laughter].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Did he have a team?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: He used to play baseball. He used to play.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This was in the days that the Washington Senators were still in town,&#13;
Werenâ&#128;&#153;t they?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of the things that I have read about Black is that he shifted from a&#13;
focus on reconstruction after the war to much more focus on development, using Bank&#13;
loans as a vehicle for development. Is that something that you recall?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. After a while, the Bank got very much involved in --&#13;
reconstruction was finished pretty much -- but in the normal work of the Bank in projects,&#13;
which is what the Bank is supposed to do. Now, thatâ&#128;&#153;s changed over time as well. In the&#13;
early days, the Bank took a pretty strict view as to what it should finance -- projects.&#13;
How do you define a project? Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what the Bank did essentially, but thatâ&#128;&#153;s expanded&#13;
now. Itâ&#128;&#153;s quite different.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Black was succeeded by George Woods. And Iâ&#128;&#153;ve mentioned this before. I think&#13;
Woods is the only man in the Bank I really did not like. He was president of First Boston&#13;
Corporation and became president of the Bank. He stayed there for one term, but he got&#13;
involved in the troubles I mentioned before.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes. He had a particular interest in India and he tried to do some things&#13;
that the board decided were its prerogative.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly right. That caused a lot of trouble. I mentioned also that when&#13;
McNamara became president, and he interviewed all the directors, they all referred to that&#13;
incident to show that they did not like Woodsâ&#128;&#153; behavior for that and should not do that&#13;
again.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;ll talk about McNamara. McNamara took this very seriously. He was&#13;
very attentive to the needs of the directors. As a matter of fact, he did things every once&#13;
in a while, [and] I told him he didnâ&#128;&#153;t have to do them. He had the power to do them. He&#13;
said, no, he wanted to get them involved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McNamara succeeded -- Woods served for one term and left, and McNamara succeeded&#13;
him. McNamara had been Secretary of Defense. Now McNamara, unlike some of the&#13;
other presidents, I think, particularly -- he was very competitive. He wanted to get&#13;
involved in matters of detail. He wanted to know what was involved when he got&#13;
involved in something, what were the issues, what were the pros and cons of things.&#13;
&#13;
As a matter of fact, as just sort of a personal note, he and I belonged to the same tennis&#13;
club, St. Albanâ&#128;&#153;s Tennis Club. He used to play mostly with his wife, but occasionally he&#13;
would play with -- he had a doubles team. His doubles group was â&#128;&#147; whatâ&#128;&#153;s her name? --&#13;
head of the Post, Graham. What was her name? Katherine Graham. There would be four&#13;
of them every once in a while whoâ&#128;&#153;d be playing. But I remember once he told me that he&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get a tennis game that Sunday. I said, â&#128;&#156;Well, if you like, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll play with you.â&#128;? He&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;No. Youâ&#128;&#153;re too good. I wonâ&#128;&#153;t play with you.â&#128;? [Laughter]. That was very nice of&#13;
him to say that, because I was too good. I used to watch him play. He would run&#13;
around. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to miss a shot. He was very much like he was as Bank&#13;
president. He wanted to get involved in everything. Sometimes he could do it very well;&#13;
sometimes he couldnâ&#128;&#153;t. He was not a good tennis player, but he tried and he ran around&#13;
like crazy.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: He obviously enjoyed the game.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: He sure did.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: He didnâ&#128;&#153;t enjoy losing.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: He did not enjoy losing. But he, as I say, got involved in matters of detail. I&#13;
remember once there was a big issue, and I wonâ&#128;&#153;t go into this particularly, as to what the&#13;
valuation of the Bank capital was. Originally the Bank capital had been denominated in&#13;
terms of gold. But the US went off the gold standard, so the question arose as to how you&#13;
value the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s capital.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And this was the early â&#128;&#152;70s.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: That became a big issue. I remember that McNamara was going to have a&#13;
meeting with the assistant secretary of the Treasury, a guy named [C.] Fred Bergsten at&#13;
the time. He wanted to know what this was all about, what the issues were. It was very&#13;
complicated. He called me on the telephone, and I was on the telephone with him for&#13;
about an hour and a quarter â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;ve never had such a long telephone conversation in my&#13;
life -- dealing with the technical issues involved. That issue stayed as an issue for a long&#13;
time. It finally got settled. Bergsten came over, we had a meeting. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t settled for a&#13;
long time. Now itâ&#128;&#153;s settled in legal tender.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This all revolves around the United States abandoning the gold&#13;
exchange standard in the early â&#128;&#152;70s.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;

                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         68&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And how then do you peg the value of anything? Very complicated&#13;
technical issue.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Youâ&#128;&#153;re right. Now itâ&#128;&#153;s just plain old legal tender dollar. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s it. So you had more than a professional relationships with&#13;
McNamara, it seems.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I did. We were pretty good friends. I used to see him personally. Iâ&#128;&#153;d go to&#13;
his house for meals, and weâ&#128;&#153;d travel together, and we would talk about all kinds of stuff,&#13;
both professionally and personal.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Did you have that sort of relationship with the earlier Bank presidents?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Certainly not with Woods. [Laughter]. But I was pretty friendly with Black.&#13;
He was totally different as a person than McNamara, but I was pretty close to both of&#13;
them. McNamara -- I was his lawyer really for about thirteen years, as long as he was&#13;
president.&#13;
&#13;
One of the things he did that was interesting [was] when he joined the Bank he started&#13;
what I think for a while was called the â&#128;&#156;Brain Trustâ&#128;? of the Bank. The Brain Trust&#13;
consisted of a few people, senior people, in the Bank. It was Burke Knapp, and me, and&#13;
the head economist, who didnâ&#128;&#153;t last long in that group, and the treasurer, I believe. And&#13;
he had two people who used to come to the meetings to take notes. That was interesting,&#13;
too. They were both ex-Rhodes scholars. They had just come from Oxford. Joe Wood&#13;
was one, and David Bock was another. Wood stayed in the Bank and ultimately became&#13;
a vice president. Bock left and joined a firm. But they took the notes. I remember once -&#13;
- McNamara told me, he said, â&#128;&#156;The people I like to hire are people who either have been&#13;
Rhodes scholars or on the Harvard Law Review or the Yale Law Journal, period.â&#128;? Later&#13;
he added the Jesuits, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t think we ever had a Jesuit, as far as I know. [Laughter].&#13;
But that little group -- Burke Knapp had been a Rhodes scholar. Those two amanuenses&#13;
were Rhodes scholars. I was hardly a Rhodes scholar, but I was there.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara, unlike, I gather, the way Wolfensohn behaves, McNamara was very careful&#13;
about who would attend his meetings. He did not like to have people there unless he&#13;
knew who they were and whether he wanted them to come. So he used to try to find out&#13;
who was going to come, and if he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want somebody to come, heâ&#128;&#153;d say, â&#128;&#156;No, donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
invite X.â&#128;? That was it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What did the Brain Trust do for McNamara? How did it --&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: We used to meet every week and considered broad matters of policy that&#13;
came up. That was about it. The thing just sort of died down after a while. Other groups&#13;
came along. But for a while it was an interesting operation all around.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        69&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And this was an informal group that probably didnâ&#128;&#153;t exist in the&#13;
structure of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t talk about it much.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But there were two people taking notes.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. There would still be notes around somewhere, I gather. I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t know.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I imagine McNamara used those for his own reflections then&#13;
afterwards. [Interruption]. Back to this group, do you have any sense of how long those&#13;
meetings went on? You said it sort of faded out after a while.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Several years.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And that started up fairly early in McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s tenure?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: It did.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of the characteristics of the McNamara era was an enormous&#13;
expansion in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s activity, in the money it raised, in the loans it made. Do you have&#13;
any reflections on that?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: As time went on, the Bank got more and more involved in the affairs of its&#13;
countries, and more countries joined, and more countries were able to take loans and deal&#13;
with loans. So I think that whether it was McNamara or anybody else, the same thing&#13;
would have happened. But the Bank got bigger and bigger. The staff got bigger and&#13;
bigger. It had to be more structured than it was. Everything got more complicated.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: There was a substantial expansion in the law department, I would think,&#13;
to handle all of this.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Sure. We started off with about a half a dozen lawyers, and I donâ&#128;&#153;t know&#13;
what they are -- over a hundred now. But the rest of the Bank same. I donâ&#128;&#153;t have&#13;
anything else to say about the presidents. I left when McNamara was still there. He left&#13;
shortly after I did. Heâ&#128;&#153;s still around.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: He keeps busy, I gather. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure he still plays tennis. I quit, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
know whether he still plays or not. [Laughter].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I still play at it, but I only play with my wife. The other issue that I&#13;
thought you might want to reflect some on are the organizational changes. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           70&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
mentioned the change in size, but there were two major reorganizations, I think, under&#13;
Black and then under McNamara. Did that impinge on your work at all?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, we were involved in all those things, in the structure. In that sense, it&#13;
impinged. Whether it affected what we did, it probably did to some extent. I think the&#13;
role of the lawyers got to be less important as time went on than they were in the&#13;
beginning. As far as McNamara is concerned, as I remember it, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think there was&#13;
any case ever where, if I told him this was illegal, he would disagree with me. He would&#13;
except it as the rule, period. There would be no discussion about it really.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: He accepted your expert advice.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: He accepted my legal advice about something. Iâ&#128;&#153;d give him all kinds of&#13;
other advice, but in that case it was clear that it was not a legal matter. Then he could do&#13;
what he pleased with it. With a legal matter, he was always ready to accept what I told&#13;
him.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The other issue is sort of the character of the Bank when you began -- it&#13;
was a small, untried organization -- and the character of the Bank when you left when it&#13;
was really an international player. The Bank is a big factor in international finance in&#13;
many ways.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s very important. Youâ&#128;&#153;re right. Itâ&#128;&#153;s used not only as a&#13;
fulcrum of what itself can do but what others do. People would look to see what the&#13;
Bank is doing as to whether or not they could go and get involved in a particular country&#13;
or to deal with a particular country. This happened all the time. This is one of the&#13;
reasons why when people got into trouble, companies got into trouble or governments got&#13;
into trouble, they might default but they would never default to the Bank. If they&#13;
defaulted to the Bank, which happened occasionally but rarely, that would put them on&#13;
bad terms with the rest of the world, and they didnâ&#128;&#153;t want that to happen. The same thing&#13;
with the International Monetary Fund. So that when you see these countries trying to&#13;
reorganize their debt, the Bank and Fund normally would say, â&#128;&#156;No, you canâ&#128;&#153;t reorganize.&#13;
Youâ&#128;&#153;ve got to pay our debt.â&#128;? That made problems for them, but thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way they&#13;
behaved. Still do, I believe.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Are there other thoughts that youâ&#128;&#153;ve had about this long career&#13;
of yours that the Bank is interested in capturing?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I was involved in so many different things and Iâ&#128;&#153;ve forgotten so many things.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A; Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You just raised the issue of immunities, which we talked about on the&#13;
phone, and which we discovered your comments on that are recorded in a transcript of a&#13;
presentation you did at the Bank on January 30th, 2001, that includes about twenty-five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
pages of comments. But if you have things that youâ&#128;&#153;d like to add to that, this, I think, is a&#13;
good time to deal with that.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Okay. Let me start from the very beginning. That presentation came about&#13;
because I was asked by the general counsel, the then general counsel, of IFC, not the&#13;
Bank, Carol Lee, to give them a lecture about what was called the present state of the&#13;
immunities of the institution. She told me at the time she would get the Bank people&#13;
involved as well. I worked on that for about a month. I must have spent a month just&#13;
simply preparing to deal with that lecture that I was going to give. It was going to last for&#13;
about an hour, that was all, which it did. When I did come for the lecture, I was&#13;
accompanied by two of my colleagues, Tom Olsen and Stuart Delerey.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Colleagues at?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: At Wilmer Cutler.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: At Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right. In doing it, let me start by saying that issues of immunities arose from&#13;
the very beginning of the Bank. They came up in many different forms and in many&#13;
different places. They were very important, often very difficult to deal with. Essentially&#13;
the problems arose because of the fact that the Bank was different than all other&#13;
institutions. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you about the Fund in a minute. But the Bank was a combination of&#13;
being both a public and a private person. It had governmental functions, essentially&#13;
governmental, but also acted like a private person. So it was subject to certain kinds of&#13;
laws but not subject to others. The question always arose as to what kinds of laws would&#13;
you be immune from and what would you not be immune from.&#13;
&#13;
IFC came along. That was different again, because IFC, unlike the Bank, deals only with&#13;
private companies. They cannot make loans to governments. So theyâ&#128;&#153;re more&#13;
accustomed to deal with private affairs, but they too were a both a government and -- a&#13;
hybrid mixture of government and private institutions.&#13;
&#13;
What I did, when Carol Lee asked me to do this, was to work on various aspects of it for&#13;
about a month. I had prepared memoranda dealing with different aspects of all of this,&#13;
which I can give you, and you can decide what you want to do with them.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I think the archives would be interested in having these.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let me show you what Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got. Here is the material. Forget this part. I&#13;
think there first four things. Forget these last two. The libel stuff, forget it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. This is a table of contents of a binder that youâ&#128;&#153;re showing me.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: This is -- yes. And youâ&#128;&#153;ll see it in there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The binder contains probably an inch of documents that relate to the&#13;
presentation that you did.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right. Exactly. And the presentation, as I say, was a brief summary of&#13;
whatâ&#128;&#153;s found in those memoranda. Those memoranda are interesting, I think, for&#13;
anybody who wants to find out the history or the present analysis dealing with&#13;
immunities, at least present in that time. Youâ&#128;&#153;d find it there.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So each of these entries, A, B, C, D, is a summary of the status of the&#13;
issue of immunities to that date.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You gave your presentation in January of 2001. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a summary&#13;
outline for January 4th, 2001, several weeks before you did the presentation; one for&#13;
October â&#128;&#152;99, August â&#128;&#152;93, so that you have gathered all of this information together at&#13;
various times and you presented that in summary form when you did the oral&#13;
presentation.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. I think this will be a very welcome addition to the archives.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Bear in mind, as I say, that some of that -- the last two things forget about. It&#13;
may be confidential. I can take it out.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I was going to say, if theyâ&#128;&#153;re confidential, you may want to remove&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Either confidential or just donâ&#128;&#153;t make any sense to anybody.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of the things I will add is that there is a transcript of the&#13;
presentation that you did. Itâ&#128;&#153;s about seventy pages double-spaced, and about twenty-five&#13;
of that is your presentation and the other is the presentation by your colleagues. That, I&#13;
hope, will be retired with the transcript of this interview, so that people can see the&#13;
presentation that you made if they consult this interview for their work.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve gone over that, and I can give it to you or give it to somebody with&#13;
some corrections on it. Let me see. Excuse me just a minute. [Interruption].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You had said there were some corrections that you had made to the oral&#13;
presentation that you gave. Do you want to talk about those a little bit?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think -- I tried to avoid making any substantial, substantive&#13;
corrections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         73&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Oh, these are corrections youâ&#128;&#153;ve made in the transcript.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: In the transcript.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Then that I can take along and if youâ&#128;&#153;ve made the notations in there,&#13;
then that will count as the edited version essentially. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s very good.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let me talk about IDA a bit, okay? Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the International Development&#13;
Association. I am reading now from a note that I prepared in 1963. It starts by talking&#13;
about the history and purpose of IDA. Itâ&#128;&#153;s an interesting case history in the development&#13;
of an international institution. It all started in September 1960. The idea of IDA had its&#13;
origin in the United States for several reasons. The US wanted an institution that would&#13;
supplement foreign aid. This was the essential reason for the organization of IDA, to&#13;
supplement foreign aid on easier terms. Also something that would tap resources of&#13;
Europe and to try to use PL-480 [Public Law 480] funds. I donâ&#128;&#153;t even know anymore&#13;
about PL-480.&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;m wrong about the date. What Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got -- the Senator [Mike] Monroney had what was&#13;
called the Monroney Resolution of March 1958, which requested that consideration be&#13;
given to the formation of the International Development Association. At the same time&#13;
that Monroney did that, the Bank staff was also considering the matter. There was a&#13;
board of governors resolution in Delhi in 1959 asking the executive directors to draft&#13;
articles of agreement.&#13;
&#13;
All the proposals assumed that IDA would be an affiliate of the Bank, and this is partly&#13;
because of the reputation and experience of the Bank, and also because membership and&#13;
weighted voting, which the Bank had. The basic purpose of IDA was to supplement the&#13;
activities of the Bank by making what was called soft loans. But a soft loan was only the&#13;
terms of payment; it was not the mechanics of the loan itself. It did not want to be called&#13;
a soft lender, and the only difference was in the financial aspects of repayment.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see. So the project had to be financially sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly. Just the way it would have been if the Bank [unclear].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But the payment terms were perhaps more generous or more flexible.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Much. One of the first big issues [was] whether the membership of IDA&#13;
would be restricted to members of the Bank, and the answer to that that emerged was&#13;
yes. Some countries wanted the membership to be open to non-members, like Russia.&#13;
Russia was not a member at the time. Also whether there would be weighted voting, and&#13;
there was. Practically itâ&#128;&#153;s the same. The initial capital structure of IDA was, in their&#13;
terms, not very big, about a billion dollars, partly divided between convertible currencies&#13;
and non-convertible currencies, all in proportion to the subscriptions of countries in the&#13;
Bank. But the figures Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got were $763 million came from the richer countries, $237&#13;
million from the poorer countries. About $320 million of that came from the United&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          74&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
States. The subscriptions are partly payable immediately and partly payable over a&#13;
period of time, partly payable in gold or convertible currencies -- gold was then legal&#13;
tender -- and partly in local currency. Of course, local currency was useless except for&#13;
purposes of projects in a particular country. The initial subscriptions, as I say, were not&#13;
very big, and they didnâ&#128;&#153;t last very long. The idea was that there would be review every&#13;
five years of the adequacy of the amounts available for IDA, and there have been&#13;
reviews.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Is this the replenishment process?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Replenishment, yes. It is very much the same as the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The charter?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The articles of agreement. No competition with private sources, no&#13;
competition. No tied loans. Normally for specific projects. In this case the government&#13;
guarantee was optional, but that was true in the case of the Bank, as well. But they also&#13;
involved with the governments. But the biggest issue involved was loans or grants.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You mean either/or? Should these be loans or grants?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right. But they decided to be loans but loans payable, I think, over fifty&#13;
years with no interest but a service charge. The operations of IDA were mostly for Bank-&#13;
type projects in countries not credit-worthy for loans from the Bank, but more social --&#13;
water, sanitation, things like that -- which the Bank did not get involved with much in the&#13;
early days.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: More social than industrial development.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Exactly. The terms were long-term, ten-year grace, no payments, fifty years&#13;
total repayment. Three-quarters of a percent service charge, one percent for ten years.&#13;
Forget that for a minute. Repayment in convertible currencies.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the organization of management of IDA, for a minute. Itâ&#128;&#153;s an affiliate of the Bank&#13;
with the same executive directors and essentially the same staff. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no separate&#13;
president or staff, unlike IFC. Itâ&#128;&#153;s all part of the Bank. I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s enough about it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Replenishment became an issue at various times, and there were&#13;
some difficulties in replenishing the capital for IDA, as I recall from my reading. Do you&#13;
recall those incidents?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. There were these problems trying to negotiate to get enough money to&#13;
be able to deal properly with IDA. IDA became bigger and bigger over time and more&#13;
important really. As I say, itâ&#128;&#153;s all one staff and we never knew which would be which&#13;
when we started dealing with a project. You canâ&#128;&#153;t be sure.&#13;

&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is an interview with Lester Nurick recorded February 22,&#13;
2005, at his home in Potomac, Maryland. The interviewer is Robert P. Grathwol.&#13;
This is part of the series of interviews for the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Tape number 1, side 1.&#13;
&#13;
All right, Lester, weâ&#128;&#153;ve agreed that you wanted to start talking about valuation, is&#13;
that right?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes, well, let me say at the beginning that there are two issues that Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
going to talk about this morning. Both were very important issues--they still are--&#13;
and thereâ&#128;&#153;s been relatively little public discussion or analysis of it, which surprises&#13;
me, because theyâ&#128;&#153;re both so important. Let me talk about those two things, the&#13;
Bank capital questions and China.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The Bank capital, under its Articles of Agreement, was denominated&#13;
in gold U.S. dollars valued on July 1, 1944, which was shortly before the Bank got&#13;
started, which was in 1946. The United States left the gold standard in 1972. At&#13;
that time, the IMF, the Fund, valued what they call the Special Drawing Rights&#13;
[SDRs] in terms of a bundle of currencies. That was the sole measure of value&#13;
under the IMF articles that were brand-new. And the IMF articles were amended&#13;
in 1976 to this effect. But the Bank articles were not.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the value of shares, the way in which the capital is denominated, is very&#13;
important for a number of reasons. It fixes the price of the shares that anybody&#13;
buys, any countries coming into the Bank. It provides a system for maintaining&#13;
value of shares. It provides for payment for shares, how you pay, how much you&#13;
pay. And it also prescribes the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending limit, how much it can lend. All&#13;
very important. This became a very touchy, sensitive issue because of the views of&#13;
the United States. They did not like the idea of having the Bank capital valued in&#13;
terms of SDRs, the way the Fund did it, so that it became a contentious issue for a&#13;
long time. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t resolved â&#128;&#147;Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you a little about that later--for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Lester Nurick&#13;
                                         Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        77&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But I still remember when the issue was particularly contentious between the Bank&#13;
and the U.S. Fred Bergsten had arranged to see McNamara--McNamara was then&#13;
president. Bergsten at the time was the assistant secretary of treasury, Fred&#13;
Bergsten. In a sense, he was our chief conduit to the United States. When we had&#13;
to do something, we had to do it either with or through Bergsten. And I used to&#13;
deal all the time with Bergstenâ&#128;&#153;s lawyer, who was a Treasury lawyer, on problems&#13;
affecting the Bank all the time.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Do you recall his name?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: The lawyer? Mike [Michael] Bradfield. As far as I know, heâ&#128;&#153;s still&#13;
around.&#13;
&#13;
At any rate, McNamara called me and he said Bergsten was coming over for a&#13;
meeting and he wanted to talk to me about these issues. Well, I was on the--I still&#13;
remember, I was on the phone with McNamara for about an hour and a quarter,&#13;
because itâ&#128;&#153;s a very difficult issue. There are a lot of different issues that&#13;
McNamara wasnâ&#128;&#153;t familiar with. And so--and McNamara did not like to be&#13;
surprised. He wanted to know everything that was going on, all the ramifications&#13;
and the details. So we were on the phone for about an hour and a quarter talking&#13;
about this all. Then we had the meeting. It was Bergsten, McNamara, me. I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
know whether Bradfield came or not. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember. And we talked about all&#13;
these issues. Nothing ever got resolved at that time, but we spoke about them and&#13;
life went on.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What were the issues that came up in that discussion?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, how to value these things. Those were the issues. How do you&#13;
value Bank capital? What do you do about the dollar? Anyway, thatâ&#128;&#153;s--nothing&#13;
really happened until after I left the Bank. It became so difficult to deal with that&#13;
nobody ended up with a solution that was acceptable all around, because the U.S.&#13;
was on one side but then some of the European countries were on the other. They&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t like the idea of just say value everything in terms of dollars. What about&#13;
sterling, what about francs? The United States at that time, I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember how&#13;
many, what percentage of their shares was, but probably about 35-40 percent,&#13;
which gradually has gone down over the years as other members have come in.&#13;
Now itâ&#128;&#153;s, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know, 20-25 percent. Which gets to another issue: How do you&#13;
determine the presidency of the Bank, but thatâ&#128;&#153;s something else again.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, when I left, it had not been resolved. It did not get resolved until 1983,&#13;
when the general counsel of the Bank, Shihata, an Egyptian, became general&#13;
counsel, very scholarly fellow--he wrote a legal opinion about the various options&#13;
which were open legally to the Bank--do you have to amend the charter, can you&#13;
do it by decree, what should you do? And itâ&#128;&#153;s a very--I got a copy, but you donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
want to see it [laughter]â&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s very long, very complicated. And in 1986, the&#13;
executive directors gave a decision adopting the SDRs as a measure of value but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        78&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
with all kinds of refinements. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s about the way it stands now. And I think&#13;
the issue is pretty well resolved.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: As I read material, I discovered that your colleague Aron Broches&#13;
had taken the position that all you had to do was say that the phrase in the articles&#13;
in effect now meant SDRs, that you didnâ&#128;&#153;t need to struggle over it. How did that&#13;
register with other people atâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, this is why it never got settled [laughter]. He was very much&#13;
involved in all this. He was general counsel before me. As a matter of fact,&#13;
Broches was the lawyer for the Dutch delegation at Bretton Woods and he then&#13;
became one of the first lawyers in the World Bank. Actually, he was the only&#13;
lawyer we had around who knew anything about international affairs. He was very&#13;
fluent in all kinds of languages, and he was my colleague. He became general&#13;
counsel--first was Chester McLain, who was an old Cravath lawyer, then Davidson&#13;
Sommers, who was another Wall Street lawyer, then Broches, and then me. And&#13;
that was about it. Broches did not get along very well with the bosses, which is&#13;
another story. That's all a different kind of issue, but it was all related.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: There's another name in that sequence that I ran across precisely&#13;
over this problem, and that's [Heribert] Golsong.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: You have a good memory. Golsong succeeded me. He was German.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see.&#13;
&#13;
  NURICK: Yeah. And he got involved in all this, too. I forget how long he&#13;
lasted.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It was a short tenure. It was a fairly short tenure.&#13;
&#13;
 NURICK: --but then he left, and Shihata succeeded him. You're right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But you were gone by the time Golsong came?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. I had joined--I was retired, and I joined Wilmer, Cutler &amp;&#13;
Pickering at that point. And after I joined Wilmer, Cutler, I used to get involved&#13;
with all kinds of issues in the Bank and the IFC. But this particular issue no&#13;
longer.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So essentially the Bank continues to value shares in terms of&#13;
dollars through this whole period?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, it was never very clear to me what they were doing [laughter].&#13;
They struggled along and it never seemed to create any real problems for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Lester Nurick&#13;
                                       Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       79&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
They couldnâ&#128;&#153;t do it forever, but it finally got settled by saying when they adopted&#13;
this interpretation. That was it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: As the Bank dealt with this issue, this was--I mean, the U.S. went&#13;
off the gold standard in â&#128;&#153;72 and this is the denouement of our involvement in&#13;
Vietnam, which did not put us in the best light internationally. To what extent did&#13;
that larger political situation play in this issue?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, that is an interesting question because what youâ&#128;&#153;re really saying&#13;
is what was the relationship between the Bank qua bank and the United States and&#13;
the Bank and other members of the Bank, and between themselves; what was the&#13;
relationship between the Bank and the U.N. and the Bank and the European&#13;
countries. And those issues are very complicated, very difficult, and they keep on&#13;
changing. And one of the things that--there was an editorial in the paper, The&#13;
Washington Post, the other day about the succession to be president of the World&#13;
Bank. Wolfensohnâ&#128;&#153;s term is up pretty soon, and theyâ&#128;&#153;re going to have to have a&#13;
new president. Wolfensohn, I think, would love to be president again, but my&#13;
guess is he wonâ&#128;&#153;t be. I canâ&#128;&#153;t talk much about this because Wolfensohn retained me&#13;
before he became president, and he wanted to talk about the Bank. But what I can&#13;
tell you is Wolfensohn thought that job was the best job in the whole world. And&#13;
he wanted to get it and he did everything possible to get it. He changed&#13;
citizenship. He was Australian and he became a U.S. citizen.&#13;
&#13;
And this was the point in the editorial which I think was unfair, or at least not&#13;
complete. They say the United States was the one that picks the president of the&#13;
World Bank. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s true, but itâ&#128;&#153;s not the story. The story is that in the early&#13;
days of the Bank, the U.S. and the European countries agreed that the U.S. would&#13;
be the country that would choose the Bank president, but the Europeans would be&#13;
the countries that would choose the head of the Fund. They divided it up that way.&#13;
And thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way it worked. Ever since the presidency has been to the U.S., and&#13;
the head of the Fund has been to a European--Frenchman or Dutchman or&#13;
somebody else. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way it works. It doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have to work that way, and&#13;
maybe it wonâ&#128;&#153;t work over time. Because the U.S. shares--the percentage of voting&#13;
has gone down over time.&#13;
&#13;
But thatâ&#128;&#153;s the deal, and my guess is it will remain to be the deal unless thereâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
major overhaul of relationships. So everything plays into everything else, as I say,&#13;
so thatâ&#128;&#153;s why itâ&#128;&#153;s so hard for me to pinpoint exactly what happens. Vietnam was&#13;
an issue, all right. And when McNamara became president--of course, he was very&#13;
much involved in Vietnam affairs--it was very interesting. I can tell you one thing&#13;
about this. I was very much opposed to that war and I used to do whatever I could&#13;
as a plain little old citizen to deal with that issue [laughter].&#13;
&#13;
But McNamara never talked about it. We talked about a lot of things--we became&#13;
friends. We talked about a lot of things, but never, not once about Vietnam, except&#13;
on one occasion which I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to talk about.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we bifurcated this a lot, and I never talked about it myself. I tried not to let it&#13;
interfere with the way I handled McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But you had been publicly opposed to the war, apparently. I&#13;
mean, would he have been aware of your attitudes towards the war?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether he did or didnâ&#128;&#153;t.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But it never played in the relationship.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Never. So I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what he knew about me because what did I&#13;
do; I went on parades [laughter].&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: However, McNamara was a smart man. Anybody he was dealing&#13;
with, he probably checked up on. But apparently it never influenced anything.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: No idea. But we never talked about it. Never. As a matter of fact, my&#13;
wife just the other day, she asked, â&#128;&#156;Since you felt so strongly about that, how did&#13;
you get along with McNamara?â&#128;? I said, â&#128;&#156;Okay, we got along fineâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Well, from the things you've told me, you seem to have&#13;
established a very cordial relationship.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: We did. When I left the Bank, he wrote me I think the nicest farewell&#13;
letter I got from anybody, about how good I was.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Well, that's great.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: And so--and he was a good president. And he was so different than&#13;
Wolfensohn, too. For example, he--when we had meetings, he wanted to know&#13;
who was coming. He did not want everybody to just come. He wanted to make&#13;
sure he knew who they were and why they were there. And Wolfensohn, I gather,&#13;
sees everybody. That was not McNamara's style.&#13;
&#13;
And when he started at the Bank, and I'm digressing, but when he started at the&#13;
Bank, he started a little brain trust, which he had in the Pentagon, I gather. And he&#13;
had about four or five people. He told me then, he said, â&#128;&#156;I like to hire only people&#13;
who are Rhodes Scholars or on the Harvard or Yale law reviews, period.â&#128;? But&#13;
later he added Jesuits.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yeah. We had no Jesuits, so [laughter]--but we had a lot of Rhodes&#13;
Scholars, a whole pile of them. He had about four or five people on this little brain&#13;
trust and about half of them were Rhodes Scholars, in fact. Interesting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Lester Nurick&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, getting back to this, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think thereâ&#128;&#153;s anything more for me to say&#13;
about it unless you have some questions.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve raised a couple of questions, youâ&#128;&#153;ve dealt with those, so I&#13;
think we can move on. If anything occurs to you as we talk about the China issue,&#13;
go ahead and put it in. But letâ&#128;&#153;s go on to the issue of Chineseâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Let's talk about China.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yeah, China.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: China was--I wrote some notes, so let me refresh my recollection on&#13;
these notes.&#13;
&#13;
China was an original member of the Bank. After the Bank started, China split in&#13;
two. It became two parts. One was the Mainland China and one, in effect, was&#13;
Taiwan. And China as a member of the Bank was represented by what was then&#13;
called the Republic of China--that is, Taiwan. In 1973, Mainland China became&#13;
the People's Republic of China, the PRC. Before that, in 1971, the United Nations&#13;
General Assembly had decided to recognize the People's Republic of China, that&#13;
is, Mainland China, as the representative of China in the United Nations and to&#13;
expel the representative, Chang kai-Shek then, which later became Taiwan. So&#13;
that was it. So in effect there were those two Chinas, Mainland China and Taiwan.&#13;
&#13;
At that point, the executive directors started to consider the membership issue.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The executive directors of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Right. Executive directors of the Bank considered the membership&#13;
issue. And it was assumed at that time that because of what happened in the&#13;
United Nations and elsewhere, that the Board of Governors would decide that&#13;
Mainland China would represent China in the Bank--that is, the PRC would&#13;
represent China in the Bank, and the Republic of China, Taiwan, would not, and&#13;
that an arrangement would have to be made between the Bank and the Republic of&#13;
China as to a settlement of accounts. And by that, what I mean is that the Bank&#13;
had started making loans to Taiwan, so the question was what was the status of the&#13;
loans. Would the Bank continue disbursing on these loans, which had not been&#13;
fully disbursed? Would Taiwan, the Republic of China, remain liable on the&#13;
loans? Those kinds of issues arose.&#13;
&#13;
Taiwan at the time was represented in the United States--they didn't call him an&#13;
ambassador; I think he was called a special representative, something like that--by&#13;
a man by the name of Marty Wong, Martin Wong. Ever hear of Martin Wong?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Iâ&#128;&#153;ve heard you mention his name a couple of times, and Iâ&#128;&#153;ve seen&#13;
his name in the material that Iâ&#128;&#153;ve read, yes.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, Martin Wong was a very interesting man, a very able, smart&#13;
man. Let me tell you a little about him, because it became relevant to what&#13;
happened.&#13;
&#13;
He was the first Chinese that got a Ph.D. in France in one of the grand Ã©coles. He&#13;
was an economist. And I got to know him through this issue, namely the&#13;
membership issue, and we became friends. We had a bridge group started in those&#13;
days and Marty Wong was one of the four of us that played together all the time.&#13;
Everybody in the Bank wanted to join that bridge group [laughter]. But I used to&#13;
have dinner at Marty Wong's house. He lived in a modest, nice apartment near&#13;
Chevy Chase somewhere, and I used to go there for dinner. He was a great fan of&#13;
food. I don't think I've ever eaten in a private house where I got such good meals&#13;
as I got at his house. But every time I ate there, the only other person there was his&#13;
wife. She cooked the meals. He would bitterly complain about it, it was no good,&#13;
no good [laughter].&#13;
&#13;
But it was very interesting. He'd take me out to dinner or lunch, and before we&#13;
would eat he would have gone into the kitchen and explored what they did and&#13;
how they behaved, and he would decide whether it was worth eating in or not. So&#13;
I used to eat very well when I was with Marty Wong [laughter].&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, I dealt with him on these issues. Finally we arranged to have what we&#13;
called a settlement of accounts.&#13;
&#13;
Oh, before that, I didn't mention that there was an interim period before they were&#13;
settled. It was sort of a no man's land--what rights did they have to vote, what&#13;
would they be, et cetera. And that's what we had to deal with in the settlement of&#13;
accounts. Marty Wong was called a special representative, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, we agreed on what we called the draft settlement of accounts. And the&#13;
main provisions of the settlement were that the Bank would continue to disburse&#13;
on existing loans, Taiwan would continue to pay the amounts due on the loans, and&#13;
the Bank would be able to have its normal procedures in dealing with these loans.&#13;
&#13;
I then went--at that time, in the early '70s, I forget the date, in the early '70s we&#13;
agreed on the draft settlement, and I went to Taiwan to deal with the Taiwanese to&#13;
make final arrangements. Marty Wong was there at the time, and it was no&#13;
problem. I was there. And Wong was interesting, because he knew that once the&#13;
Chinese--China had split into two parts--that sooner or later it would become a&#13;
contentious, difficult, sensitive issue--as of course it has right now. And he really&#13;
foretold what was going to happen, and he was right. He's dead. But that's what&#13;
happened.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Lester Nurick&#13;
                                        Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     83&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So that issue got settled, and that was it. But as I say, thereâ&#128;&#153;s been very little&#13;
attention given to how it all happened, why it happened.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I found in the archives a couple of position papers you wrote on&#13;
this issue.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: I sure did.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Of dealing with how the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Republic of China, under what&#13;
terms they would assume the representation and how to settle up the issues of the&#13;
capital contribution that had been made by something that predated the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Republic of China.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: You do your homework, all right.&#13;
&#13;
I have the [Willi] Wapenhans Report also on this list of things to talk about. Do&#13;
you want to talk about that at all?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Sure. Letâ&#128;&#153;s talk about that.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, let me talk about that. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s not much to say. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll get back to it&#13;
in a minute.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Now, this report develops after youâ&#128;&#153;ve left the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Which?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The Wapenhans.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Well, let me tell you how it happened.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. The Wapenhans Report stemmed from a decision taken by&#13;
[Lewis T.] Preston, who was then president of the Bank, in February 1992. I had&#13;
retired from the Bank about 11 years before and joined Wilmer, Cutler, but Willi&#13;
Wapenhans, who had been designated by Preston to be the head of this committee&#13;
that would look into the matter, called me and asked me to join the team as&#13;
counsel. I agreed, and I took a partial leave of absence from Wilmer, Cutler to&#13;
deal with this, because it was a big job. And I had an office, along with other&#13;
people, at the Inter-American Development Bank.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What was the focus of this commission? What were they to be&#13;
looking at?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Lester Nurick&#13;
                                          Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          84&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Yes. It made an extensive review of all aspects of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s loan&#13;
policies from the time a project was studied by the Bank, how careful was the&#13;
Bank, what were the results of the project, what did borrowers think of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
performance, what were the views of other international agencies, all--in other&#13;
words, itâ&#128;&#153;s called portfolio management. And it was a very comprehensive&#13;
examination of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s processes. And what I did was meet with the team of&#13;
people that Wapenhans had assembled to deal with these issues, mostly people&#13;
from the Inter-American Bank, the other international organizations--the Inter-&#13;
American Bank, the Fund, the European Investment Bank, the Asian Development&#13;
Bank, the African Development Bank. We met constantly. And they were a very&#13;
able, sensible bunch of people.&#13;
&#13;
Somewhere along the process, towards the end--I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember exactly when I&#13;
did this, but I resigned. I was unhappy with something or other that Wapenhans&#13;
was doing. Wapenhans was an able guy, but I decided for some reason I would&#13;
quit, so I did. And I quit. Later, the report was issued in September â&#128;&#153;92. Now, to&#13;
my surprise--I didnâ&#128;&#153;t even know this--itâ&#128;&#153;s still highly confidential and has not been&#13;
published. Why, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know. And I have a copy of it which I have to return to&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s archives. Here it is. I have to return it. But this is it, see. And I've got&#13;
to give it back. That's it. I still don't know why it's so confidential--maybe&#13;
because it's critical. I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That's a very concentrated period of, what, eight months or so,&#13;
seven months to look at the entire operation of the Bank as it deals with other&#13;
countries and borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Well, I think we can probably stop there. But I do want to talk to&#13;
you then about the documentation you have. Okay?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Is that good?&#13;
&#13;
NURICK: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay.&#13;
