For centuries, internal audit was a simple administrative procedure of checking documents,&#13;
counting assets, and reporting on past events to various types of management. Several forces in&#13;
our times have led to a quiet revolution in internal audit. Democracy requires government to be&#13;
accountable in its use of public money and in providing effective, efficient, and economical&#13;
service delivery. Ever larger and more complex systems require greater competencies, thus&#13;
internal audit has had to become ever more professional. Sheer size also brings with it the need to&#13;
assess risk, deploying scarce resources in the most logical manner to address those risks.&#13;
Technological advances have made it possible to track and analyse more data much faster. An&#13;
informed world that keeps turning ever faster, makes it essential for governments to be well&#13;
informed by internal audit about the risks and improvements in public finance management and&#13;
service delivery.&#13;

&#13;
As part of its Public Sector Governance program, the Poverty Reduction and Economic Reform&#13;
Division of the World Bank Institute (WBIPR) is engaged in strengthening responsive (matching&#13;
public services with citizens' preferences), responsible ( efficiency and equity in service&#13;
provision without undue fiscal and social risk) and accountable (to citizens for all actions) public&#13;
governance in developing countries. The Division is active on a broad front, including division&#13;
and exercise of fiscal powers (taxing, spending and regulatory responsibilities) by various levels&#13;
of government, intergovernmental finance and policy coordination, budgeting and budgetary&#13;
institutions, debt management, public financial management, e-government, public&#13;
management/administration (civil service reform) and service delivery mechanisms and&#13;
institutions, as well as legislative (various parliamentary committees, etc.), executive, judicial,&#13;
legal framework, media, and other civil society institutions. It also includes mechanisms for&#13;
public financial accountability and integrity, rules and codes for fiscal transparency, citizens'&#13;
charter, citizens' score cards on government performance and private-public sector nexus.&#13;
&#13;
As part of its program for Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability for Africa, financed&#13;
by Sweden, WBIPR joined forces with the World Bank's Financial Management division and&#13;
external partners, such as the the Institute of Internal Auditors, to organize learning events in&#13;
Africa on designing and implementing integrated public expenditure and financial accountability&#13;
reforms for key stakeholders - including ministries of finance, line ministries, local governments,&#13;
supreme audit institutions, parliament, the media, and civil society organizations. One such event&#13;
was a consultative forum on Internal Audit for stakeholders from Kenya, Uganda, Malawi and&#13;
Ethiopia. During four days in 2004, lively discussion and planning took place on demand and&#13;
supply impediments to increasing the role, image and effectiveness of internal audit in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
This paper examines the questions raised during these seminars, particularly the Consultative&#13;
Forum, by the participating countries and looks at the role of internal audit and its future in&#13;
Africa. The author wishes to thank Dominique Vincenti, Institute of Internal Audit, and Gert van&#13;
der Linde, World Bank for their valuable input to this document. Furthermore, the paper draws&#13;
heavily on the abovementioned activities: discussions, presentations, etc. (available on the&#13;

                                         Internal Audit&#13;
                       Finding Its Place in Public Finance Management&#13;
&#13;
Only very recently, during the last 15-20 years, has internal audit become a true profession with&#13;
major potential to influence the management of public finances. This means that developed&#13;
countries have only recently made the transition to modern internal audit, making their&#13;
experiences relevant for other countries currently trying to achieve this conversion. It also means&#13;
that the concerns related to internal audit are shared globally.&#13;
&#13;
One main concern is the degree of independence accorded to internal audit in government&#13;
structures and organization. As there are still, in many cases, challenges for external audit to&#13;
become independent of the executive1, independence (structural and financial) for internal audit is&#13;
yet another step to take. Internal audit must add value to management, while at the same time not&#13;
becoming its servant, but faithfully report on the status to the board or other equivalent governing&#13;
body.&#13;
&#13;
The value proposition of the internal audit function also needs to become one of a positive,&#13;
forward-looking contribution to the management of risks in the organisation. Making the shift&#13;
from a "policing" role toward a positive value contribution for enterprise-wide risk management,&#13;
is a major challenge for the internal audit function in many organisations. It is dependent on a&#13;
clear appreciation and explicit need for internal audit services that will support risk management&#13;
activities in the organization. Increased size and complexity in organisational structures will&#13;
maintain a demand for traditional internal audit, but it is incumbent on the internal audit unit to&#13;
demonstrate that it can contribute to effective and efficient service delivery in order to drive the&#13;
demand for enhanced internal audit.&#13;
&#13;
Another major challenge is to professionalize the internal audit function. Auditors need to be&#13;
increasingly competent in many different areas in order to do a good job: risk and control&#13;
analysis, financial analysis, computer technology, etc. These skills need to be recognised, which&#13;
is most easily done through a system of certification. Furthermore, there is increasing pressure on&#13;
auditors to undertake more audits, and of a more complex character, than before (Value for&#13;
Money audits, for instance). Rewards, both financial and non-financial, need to be commensurate&#13;
with the time, skill and educational demands placed on auditors.&#13;
&#13;
An important factor in the professionalisation of internal audit is to create a solid ethical climate.&#13;
Without an ethical environment, laws will never be properly applied, and the legal framework&#13;
will only be for show.&#13;
&#13;
To make this major change in the IA function will take time, since it demands a change in culture,&#13;
internal audit services, and perception. In order to drive the change, sustained leadership at high&#13;
levels is of vital importance.&#13;
&#13;
This paper aims at expanding on the above factors by providing some background on IA, a view&#13;
of modern internal audit, and one example of work in this area in Africa.&#13;

                           Internal Audit ­ a Little History&#13;
&#13;
In the mists of time before agriculture took over from hunting and fishing, man recorded big&#13;
successes, along with hopes for such catches on cave walls. Five thousand years ago, there were&#13;
people in Mesopotamia communicating basic information on crops and taxes in pictograms.&#13;
Various recording systems, detailing financial transactions, inventory, sales volumes, etc., have&#13;
been found in many other cultures such as the Egyptian, Greek, Aztek, Chinese, Persian and&#13;
Hebrew civilizations. It might be inferred that, as soon as there are assets and transactions, there&#13;
is a necessity to keep track of these.&#13;
&#13;
In ancient Rome, one official would compare records with another, an application of both&#13;
separation of duties and verification. The term "audit" possibly hails from this practice, from the&#13;
Latin "audire", to listen.&#13;
&#13;
After the fall of Rome, there is a hiatus due to very few written sources surviving to this day.&#13;
However, it can be safely assumed that records were kept by kings, religious centres, etc. even&#13;
during those dark ages. The Vikings left stones with messages in their Runic alphabet,&#13;
mentioning the division of assets in families and riches they brought home from their raids. In&#13;
1086, a truly remarkable survey of all English lands and assets was commissioned by William the&#13;
Conqueror, the Domesday Book. The thoroughness of this document, which does not leave a&#13;
goose or an "the eighth part of a mill"2 undocumented, is extraordinary, considering the time and&#13;
the rudimentary technology used. In 1340, the English parliament appointed commissioners to&#13;
audit the accounts of the collectors of subsidies3.&#13;
&#13;
From the end of the 19th century, there is a Swedish description of the work of an auditor as&#13;
somebody who, due to his employment or as a consequence of an extraordinary mission,&#13;
scrutinises accounts and measures taken, and reports to the proper authorities. The profession had&#13;
gained entry into Swedish public management through the regulation of public institutions during&#13;
the 1870's. In 1916, the state audit unit was the superior instance for scrutiny of invoices with&#13;
authenticating documents, which had already been checked by the individual departments. This&#13;
unit employed two commissioners, 20 auditors, assistant auditors and female accounting&#13;
assistants. These auditors enjoyed higher salaries and better pay than other public auditors4.&#13;

&#13;
Box 1: Example of IA development ­ the case of Sweden&#13;
In 1634, Count Axel Oxenstierna, leading advisor to Queen Christina, organized and modernized&#13;
the Swedish state administration in a way that largely remained unchanged until our times5.&#13;
Sweden still has his unique combination of a very small government administration and large&#13;
separate boards of authority. However, at the end of the 19th century, society started to develop at&#13;
a much faster pace. At that time, the well-known Swedish writer August Strindberg wrote a&#13;
scathing satire about Swedish officialdom in "The Red Room". The image of plodding bean&#13;
counters, concerned with making columns tally was probably not far off the mark.&#13;
&#13;
In 1951 a small association was founded to allow internal auditors to get in touch with each other.&#13;
Nevertheless, according to a veteran6, it is only today that internal auditors are regarded as an&#13;
established and recognized profession. There was even a time, when he believed that internal&#13;
auditors would soon be extinct.&#13;
&#13;
However, it was not until the 1980's that an at times lively discussion took place as to which&#13;
direction and which objectives IA should adopt. During the 1990's, as internal audit gained a&#13;
professional identity of its own, risk analysis came to be included in IA. To control public entities&#13;
with large flows of resources, a new law was introduced in 1995. The Parliament Auditors&#13;
reviewed the state IA in 1999 and came to the conclusion that IA methods and competence was&#13;
satisfactory, but that IA was not fully utilized and that recommendations were not implemented&#13;
properly. In 2002, the Swedish SAI found7 that the position of IA was institutionally weak, many&#13;
auditors work alone and that the interpretation of standards was not uniform. The government&#13;
then commissioned an inquiry to gain an overview of all public sector internal audits. This&#13;
inquiry was delivered at the end of last year. Its recommendations included measures to clarify&#13;
the responsibility for internal management, control, and audit and to professionalize the state&#13;
internal audit.&#13;
&#13;
In 2003, the former Auditor-General together with other high level officials, business people and&#13;
academics created The Audit Academy to further the audit agenda in society, academic courses,&#13;
to improve educational quality, stimulate audit research and elevate the image of the profession to&#13;
attract students and delete the "mark of boredom" with which the profession is still plagued.&#13;

&#13;
The beginning of the twentieth century saw the birth of many large, and very large corporations,&#13;
which fuelled the demand for accounts and control. The Institute of Internal Auditors was&#13;
established in 1941, and was, and is, the driving force behind the professionalization of internal&#13;
audit and the development of internal audit. It now serves approximately 94,000 members in&#13;
internal auditing, governance and internal control, IT audit, education, and security worldwide.&#13;
The world's leader in certification, education, research, and technological guidance for the IA&#13;
profession, The Institute serves as the profession's watchdog and resource on significant auditing&#13;
issues around the globe, as shown by its motto "Progress Through Sharing".&#13;

structure set up in the 17th century.&#13;

                                     Modern Internal Audit&#13;
&#13;
The IIA has elaborated a definition of IA which is now widely accepted: "Internal auditing is an&#13;
independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an&#13;
organization's operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a&#13;
systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management,&#13;
control, and governance processes."8 This definition encapsulates the scope and challenges for&#13;
modern IA.&#13;
&#13;
However, in order to go from merely ensuring compliance with rules and regulations, the so&#13;
called "tick and flick" approach, to being able to deliver an added value to the organization in line&#13;
with the above definition, demands a massive culture and organisational change. The&#13;
organisational culture must be one of appreciation and responsiveness to the findings and&#13;
recommendations of IA. The IA needs to be truly independent, have a good understanding of the&#13;
situation in the organization and the issues it is facing, as well as being responsive to&#13;
management's needs. To understand the situation, IA must be able to assess key business risks in&#13;
order to advise and assure the management. It must contribute to performance improvement and&#13;
be proactive in communication with management. The IA function must be in a position to match&#13;
its skills set to the organisation's needs and use enabling technology and work smarter.&#13;
&#13;
IA can take many forms, since in designing a workable IA system, the wider Public Finance&#13;
Management system, into which IA must fit, must be taken into account.9 "Whatever form&#13;
internal audit takes, an important issue in establishing its credibility, and the extent to which the&#13;
Supreme Audit Institutions can rely on its work, is independence....Internal auditors should be&#13;
independent of the activities they audit."10&#13;
&#13;
"IIA issued in 1992 five Standards and Guidelines for the Professional Practice of Internal&#13;
Auditing, consolidating previous guidance. The five standards cover: independence, professional&#13;
proficiency (standards, due professional care), scope of work, performance of audit work&#13;
(planning, testing, review) and management of the internal audit department. The Standards&#13;
issued by the internal audit services of the United Nations Organisations cover the same five&#13;
areas and are identical in content."11&#13;
&#13;
There are several current forces that will necessitate further development of the profession such&#13;
as risk management, governance, e-business, privacy concerns (what kind of information should&#13;
the state make public and when), technology, environmental, health and safety, fraud/money&#13;
laundering, outsourcing, co-sourcing, etc. Just to look at fraud, which is a major concern, there&#13;
are some recent U.S. figures12 which show the complexity and the need for a considered stratgey,&#13;
of this one issue: A typical U.S. organisation loses 6% of its annual revenues to fraud. Forty&#13;
percent of fraud is detected by a tip (mostly by employees 60%, but also by clients, vendors and&#13;
undisclosed sources). Internal audit discovers 24% and internal controls 18% - 21% is unveiled&#13;

&#13;
Box 2: Defining the Role of Internal Audit ­ the case of the UK&#13;
During the last 30 years, the UK has developed its IA from internal checks, "turn and tick", to a&#13;
systems based approach, which monitors the accomplishment of established goals and objectives,&#13;
ensures compliance with relevant laws and regulations and reliability and integrity of information&#13;
for a economic, effective and efficient use of resources, while safeguarding assets. There are now&#13;
10 standards, half relating to organizational status and half to operational approach. These&#13;
standards detail&#13;
     · The scope of IA,&#13;
     · Its organizational independence, risk management control, required qualifications for&#13;
         the Head of IA,&#13;
     · The establishment of audit committees,&#13;
     · Relationships with management, other auditors, other review bodies;&#13;
     · Staffing, training and development;&#13;
     · Audit strategy;&#13;
     · Management of Audit Assignments;&#13;
     · Due Professional Care;&#13;
     · Reporting to ensure clear and concise reports;&#13;
     · Quality Assurance/&#13;
IA is looking to prevent fraud, not find it - a watchdog, not blood hound.&#13;

&#13;
Events such as Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Anderson and Parmalat have further increased the&#13;
awareness of the importance of sound accounting and audit, and made it clear that rules14 are not&#13;
enough. The ethical climate must be very strong, all the way to the top. Internal auditors can&#13;
expect to have to meet increased demand for compentency levels for increased credibility, gain&#13;
stronger than average computer skills, to develop a more in-depth understanding of the business,&#13;
its risks and risk appetite and its control systems. In an increasing complex business climate,&#13;
more pressure will be put on the auditing profession.&#13;
&#13;
                     Challenging Circumstances and Reform&#13;
&#13;
Many countries are still struggling with very limiting environments for IA with poor internal&#13;
control, poorly paid and motivated staff, lack of an ethical organisational culture, weak&#13;
governance, lack of support from senior management and limited human resources. There may&#13;
also be a lack of appropriate regulations, resources and IA can suffer from low status and lack of&#13;
independence.&#13;
&#13;
To transform IA in such a situation, the overridning prerequisite for successful reform is strong,&#13;
active leadership support to improve governance and the IA contribution to that, over the long&#13;
term. The agreement and active involvement of the head of internal audit, senior managers, audit&#13;
staff, accounting officers and senior operational management must be secured in a climate that&#13;
&#13;
13External audit captures 11% of fraud and the police 1% - the sum total exceeds 100% because in some&#13;
case more than one method was identified&#13;
14The American Securities and Exchange Commission is one of the strictest in the world and still could not&#13;
prevent these scandals.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
fosters independent, but valued, evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management, control, and&#13;
governance processes. For sustained change, internal co-operation is necessary, but not enough.&#13;
External relationships must also be fostered, to keep up awareness of the changes, reforms and&#13;
improvements in IA so that stakeholders, policy- and decisionsmakers take into account the&#13;
contributions IA can offer and to bolster growing confidence in IA.&#13;
&#13;
When seeking to reform IA, it must first be included in the government's reform agenda. IA must&#13;
assess how it fits into key reforms, and situate itself as part of the change. An identification of key&#13;
reformers makes it possible to lobby them for IA reform, while raising awareness of the important&#13;
contribution of IA.&#13;
&#13;
One of the reasons that IA reforms will demand more than short-term efforts, is that modern IA&#13;
demands a change of culture. Going from being only a "police force", dedicated to uncover fraud&#13;
and errors, to preventing future problems is a major turnaround. Success factors must be&#13;
redefined, such as having recommendations implemented, as opposed to merely reporting number&#13;
of fraud and errors detected. This change will need time to be implemented fully, and will usually&#13;
go through transitional stages, where both implemented recommendations and detection are&#13;
recognised, while at the same time celebrating clean and improved internal audits.&#13;
&#13;
Staff and staff development are of the utmost importance. Human resources need to be reviewed.&#13;
Strengths and weaknesses, along with training needs must be identified. A team spirit, with staff&#13;
understanding the aims of modern IA and embracing the ethics, should be built. As more&#13;
demands for professionalisation and taking responsibility are placed on staff, the rewards and&#13;
compensation structure must be revised. As most public sectors, be they in developed or&#13;
developing countries, have rather less possibilities to compete with private sector salaries, this&#13;
questions merits careful consideration. There are several non-financial ways to motivate staff.&#13;
Keeping in mind that staff are different and thus require different motivators, some possibilities&#13;
include:&#13;
     · Have development plans for each staff member, with training and future possibilities&#13;
     · Make sure that file reviews praise recommendations made&#13;
     · Represent the IA at meetings and conferences&#13;
     · Recognition at annual audit conference: awards, diplomas, etc.&#13;
     · Praise in audit publications&#13;
     · Choice of assignments&#13;
     · Travel opportunities: audit work, training, conferences, etc.&#13;
     · Support for professional training&#13;
     · Participation in exchange programs (for instance with the Auditor-General)&#13;
&#13;
It is also important to build teams, that can work well and professionally together. If you can&#13;
achieve true team building for reform, the team will be an important driver of change, working&#13;
for improvement on an incremental basis, which is key to lasting, well-anchored change. The&#13;
team leader needs to carefully consider how he/she wants to accomplish this. Team building&#13;
ingredients include: regular training for all IA staff, annual conference for the IA staff, regular&#13;
publications sent to audit staff and key client managers, recognition of good audit work, public&#13;
praise for outstanding audit work, ensuring that promotion is based on achievement, and working&#13;
towards a flatter team-based structure. The team must also include a good mix of different IA&#13;
specialities to cater to the established auditing plan, such as forensic, IT, banking, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Forging a new relationship with IA clients is of prime importance. As mentioned earlier, it is vital&#13;
that management's support is clear and unequivocal. It is useful if this can be formalised, for&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                  Internal Audit: Finding its Place in Public Finance Management          7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
instance in a "Statement of Support" made by top management, alongside with the legal&#13;
requirements. With changes in government, this statement should be renewed, both to assure IA&#13;
staff of continued support and to raise awareness in the incoming management team of the&#13;
importance of IA. Appropriate training programs for operational staff and manager, as well as&#13;
other who come into contact with IA and who have an influence on IA, should be considered in&#13;
order to raise awareness of what modern IA can contribute to the organisation's future. The IA&#13;
function should work closely together with operational managers to improve the organization's&#13;
evaluation of risks and determining its risk appetite, to improve its systems, regulations,&#13;
procedures and the ethical environment. In order for IA to have more impact and be recognized&#13;
for this, a risk-based plan should be made for each audit assignment with clear outputs delineated.&#13;
The audit should deliver key recommendations for improvement of the system, targetted both at&#13;
the short and long term. IA should try to assist managers in implementing these&#13;
recommendations. In the long run, IA will be seen as an asset to the organisation, thus its image&#13;
will be improved, and it will be able to move from not only detecting undesirable behaviour, but&#13;
to preventing it happening.&#13;
&#13;
The increased and closer co-operation between IA and management renders the question of&#13;
independence all the more important15. Measures must be taken to ensures that the IA manager&#13;
can stand firm, if so required by the IA findings, and report to the board. The most important&#13;
steps are to see to it that the IA manager is not appointed by management and thus not fired by it&#13;
either, and that the IA budget is decided in collaboration between management and the audit&#13;
committee or the executive board, whichever the case may be. The IA manager must also have&#13;
the possibility to deploy the budget as he/she sees fit.&#13;
&#13;
However, the very best auditors and auditing teams will not perform well unless the environment&#13;
supports them and enables them to do their work. The Swedish SAI reported in 2002 that several&#13;
state internal auditors, who in many cases had been recruited from the private sector, had left their&#13;
state positions because they did not see enough change as a result of their work.16&#13;
&#13;
In an enabling reform environment, accounting officers and their senior officials are held&#13;
responsible for sound systems of internal control. Key aspects of the system of internal financial&#13;
control are documented in comprehensive financial regulations, which are reviewed on a regular&#13;
basis. Independent audit committees advise accounting officers on all aspects of internal control&#13;
and audit. There is a clear framework of checks and balances including openness, accountability&#13;
and integrity at the highest levels. Furthermore, there is senior management support for internal&#13;
audit and a climate where managers and internal and external audit co-operate for mutual benefit.&#13;
&#13;
It is important to identify and categorize the parameters for IA work, to understand where the&#13;
supports and constraints lie. Main factors include:&#13;
     · Resources (budget for staff, equipment, infrastructure, services, etc.)&#13;
     · Organisation (leadership, degree of independence, responsibility for work, guidance by&#13;
         independent audit committee)&#13;
     · Relations (with Accounting Officers, Auditor-General, etc.)&#13;
     · Services (balance of types of work needed)&#13;
     · Procedure (sets of regulations establishing standards, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15Especially in the light of the figures mentioned earlier concerning the most costly fraud&#13;
16"Internrevision i staten" ("State internal audit"), a report on the working situation for auditors and how&#13;
government authorities manage audit, 23-2001-1153, Riksrevisionen, 2002&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8     Cecilia Nordin Van Gansberghe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Having performed the above assessment, there is an IA framework, which needs to be&#13;
complemented by risk analysis, to establish IA priorities. It is essential to know the key risk areas,&#13;
such as financial risks and operational risks in contracts and payroll, and to measure these risks in&#13;
terms of impact and the likelihood of it happening. This can be supported by previous occurences&#13;
of fraud, errors and control breakdowns. The new approach consists of identifying weaknesses in&#13;
the organisation, make recommendations and work with managers to make the changes and make&#13;
reform happen. This means a proactive risk-based approach to audit, as opposed to a reactive,&#13;
pre-audit one.&#13;
&#13;
Communication with management must be clear to achieve the measurement of effectiveness of&#13;
risk management, control and governance processes. Usually the IA resources are limited, which&#13;
means that there needs to be a selection of audits that can be done. Some prioritisation might be&#13;
more easily done: to choose the ministries with the largest budgets, most staff and highest rate of&#13;
fraud and errors. Some may be more difficult to pick. In order to overcome this obstacle, each&#13;
ministry needs to be assessed, for example, on size of budget, past levels of error and fraud,&#13;
sensitivity and management concerns. Each of these categories can be adjudged a score which&#13;
will indicate the risk level of the system: high (yearly), medium (every 2 years) and low (every 3&#13;
years) risk. The management must understand these assessments and look at what it means for the&#13;
achievement of more effective risk management, control, service deliver and governance&#13;
processes. The executive board and/or audit committee should be kept fully informed and&#13;
sanction these decisions.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, there are different levels of reform that can be undertaken. It is worthwhile to&#13;
evaluate what reform measures could be taken immediately, which need the co-operation with&#13;
others; such as operational managers, senior management, Accounting Officers, Auditor-General,&#13;
etc., which require additional staff or other resources and which require legal or regularity reform.&#13;
&#13;
Some suggestions for early action to start reform are training for all internal audit staff, reducing&#13;
the emphasis on pre-audit, increase the importance of IA recommendations and management&#13;
actions, working long-term with managers rather than sweeping in to audit them and their staff,&#13;
involve management and staff in IA planning, work with managers to develop action plans and&#13;
produce IA publications for all internal auditors and clients. A practical IA manual could be one&#13;
way to influence internal auditors and clients, to engage internal auditors in the reform of IA, be&#13;
an opportunity to review working practices, a practical guide for better IA practices and it could&#13;
also be an effective training aid. The caveat is that such a manual needs to be updated regularly in&#13;
order to remain relevant.&#13;
&#13;
As seen from the above, communications about expectations and comparable results are vital to&#13;
building a new, modern, credible IA. Without it, suspicion and mistrust will develop,&#13;
collaboration will not happen, vital audit information will not be used, IA will not be informed of&#13;
the environment which it is supposed to support and IA will be left without credibility. Having&#13;
good communications in internal relations with staff and audit clients is good, but communication&#13;
should extend further. One prime relationship that IA should take care to foster is the relation&#13;
with the Auditor-General, as his/her office in some sense is the auditor of the work IA does. This&#13;
means that IA is an important link in the accountability system. As it is stated in the Swedish&#13;
constitution "The Government governs the Realm. It is accountable to the Riksdag&#13;
[parliament]"17, and IA forms one of the bases for this reporting to the people, as represented by&#13;
parliament. Some examples of strengthening the relationship with the Auditor-General are&#13;
agreeing to allow each other access to files, send copies of final reports to each other, have&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
regular meetings at management and operational levels, together work to avoid duplication of&#13;
work, attend the same training events, mutually recognize findings and recommendations and&#13;
have an active exchange of staff.&#13;
&#13;
Box 3: Implementing an Internal Audit Reform Program&#13;
Case study for National Department of Health, South Africa&#13;
&#13;
The status of the IA department was determined by going through the profiles of professional&#13;
staff, attitudes, degree of empowerment, the political influences, gender issues, level of&#13;
understanding of IA function, work ethic, respect and awareness of government policies. A longer&#13;
term rolling strategic plan, which identified core objectives, goals, targets and indicators, was&#13;
developed, along with annual IA plans. To build relationships with its clients, the IA function&#13;
worked actively on staying relevant to management's needs (by for instance performing ad hoc&#13;
assignments), constant research to stay updated and relevant and by being proactive. Some&#13;
actions to build relations and an IA image were to organize management workshops and&#13;
seminars, having contacts with organized labour and putting up IIA posters in the IA department.&#13;
Honesty and diplomacy were two skills much in demand. The IA function strove to avoid the&#13;
stigmata of being seen as a fraud investigative unit and not to take issue with everything. Staff&#13;
were encouraged to join the IIA and keep up their professional training. Management ensured that&#13;
each staff member had a personal development plan. Confidence in staff was shown by giving&#13;
them the chair at IA meetings, with management as participants. Recruitment was tailored to the&#13;
IA strategic plan and risk profile. The results so far include a control-conscious and corruption&#13;
free culture, not only in the Health Department, but throughout the National Health System.&#13;
Feedback is now timely, which was the main challenge as the software was not fully utilized,&#13;
training had not been done and there was a shortage of staff. There are still goals and targets to be&#13;
reached but with the "6 C" approach, these will also be implemented: Compassion (do not judge,&#13;
bring hope), Community (serve the public), Communication (build relationships), Challenge&#13;
(never give up), Commitment and Compromise (focus on long-term values).&#13;

    The Situation Today ­ One Example of Stock-Taking in Africa&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has carried out Country Financial Accountability Assessement for 27 countries&#13;
in Africa. The CFAA is a diagnosis of a country's private and public financial management&#13;
systems. Its purpose is twofold:&#13;
(i) to help the borrower and the Bank assess and manage the risk that public funds will be used&#13;
other than for agreed purposes (the fiduciary objective), and&#13;
(ii) to support the borrower in the design and implementation of financial management capacity-&#13;
building programs (the developmental objective).&#13;
The CFAAs done in Africa, identify internal audit challenges as a cross-cutting issue in the&#13;
region. Major improvements are necessary in the internal control and audit systems for effective&#13;
Public Finance Management, better service service delivery and poverty eradication.&#13;
Consequently, the Banks's different departments have joined forces to assist countries in the&#13;
region in this respect by facilitating dialogue, discussions, exchange of experiences and planning.&#13;
&#13;
In March, 2004, sponsored by the World Bank and the Institute of Internal Auditors, the&#13;
Consultative Forum on Internal Audit brought together 52 stakeholders from Kenya, Uganda,&#13;
Malawi and Ethiopia to discuss and plan how to increase the role and image of internal audit in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10     Cecilia Nordin Van Gansberghe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
their countries, in order to make it more effective and professional. Participants represented a&#13;
wide cross section of stakeholders such as Accountants General, Auditors General, Senior&#13;
representatives of the Ministries of Finance and relevant line ministries, Chairs of Public&#13;
Accounts Committees of Parliament, private sector representatives, academics, accounting&#13;
educators and certification bodies, internal audit practitioners and chairpersons of the IIA&#13;
chapters.&#13;
&#13;
Prior to the forum, the participants and the relevant affliates of the Internal Institute of Auditors&#13;
had completed a survey designed to plot the current status, as well as the longer term outlook of&#13;
internal audit in Kenya, Uganda, Malawi and Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
Results from this survey were:&#13;
    · If IA could be rendered effective, it would increase the effectiveness of spending in both&#13;
         public and private sectors&#13;
    · Today the primary function of IA is first to ensure compliance, second to check the&#13;
         accuracy of the transactions&#13;
    · Over the long term, 10 years, there will be a shift to reviewing managerial procedures to&#13;
         ensure effectiveness and efficiency (but no change is foreseen over a three year&#13;
         perspective)18&#13;
    · The strongest supporters of an effective IA are to be found amongst the accountability&#13;
         institutions (Auditors General, Accountants General), but also in the Ministries of&#13;
         Finance and line ministries&#13;
    · Current reforms in financial management and budgeting/public expenditure are those&#13;
         most likely to impact on IA&#13;
    · There is much room for improvement in the IA function&#13;
    · Some internal auditors spend up to 75% of their time on pre-audits of transactions&#13;
    · Most IA functions establish work programs at the beginning of the year based on internal&#13;
         analysis of the financial risks of the organization&#13;
    · IA's clients were viewed as being several: head of entity, management and external&#13;
         monitors&#13;
    · IA recommendations are acted upon very diffently: in some countries up to 75% of the&#13;
         recommendations are implemented, in others it can be less than 25%&#13;
    · Many felt that in order for IA to be effective, it needs to be a completely independent&#13;
         group&#13;
    · There is a lack of qualified internal auditors as well as possiblities to qualify&#13;
    · There is awareness of standards, but they are mostly not applied&#13;
&#13;
During the extensive discussions at the Consultative Forum, six main themes were identified as&#13;
crucial in building an effective internal audit function in the participating countries. These are&#13;
detailed below. Many of the points concur with what is described above in "Challenging&#13;
Circumstances and Reform".&#13;
&#13;
1. Perception and Ownership&#13;
The leadership sets the tone by establishing the governance, risk management and control systems&#13;
and consistently applying sanctions. The function of IA is to assess that the service delivery&#13;
systems work effectively and efficiently, to suggest improvements and see to it that these are&#13;
implemented. Management must be more aware of what internal audit can do to assist it, while&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18This item confirms that it is a major shift in culture to move to modern IA and that it will take time to&#13;
anchor these new ideas and approach.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                              Internal Audit: Finding its Place in Public Finance Management  11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
internal audit needs to integrate into the structures of the organization by being more&#13;
professionally competent and focused on the organization's objectives and see IA work in that&#13;
light. As the IA function becomes more professional, it will be able to assist management in its&#13;
decision-making and thus ensure a more proactive and forward-looking role. It is vital that the IA&#13;
function balance their work with developing, assessing and maintaining internal controls with the&#13;
priorities for effective and efficient service delivery, to ensure that management fully understands&#13;
and endorses the value added of IA to organisational objectives. If the IA function is successful in&#13;
doing this, it will move away from the image of "nit-picking" and being merely a burdensome&#13;
overhead cost.&#13;
&#13;
The participants discussed having specific marketing plans for raising awareness in government&#13;
and the public. It was emphasised that this must be accompanied by improved IA service delivery&#13;
and the introduction of a quality assurance program. The establishment of a professional body,&#13;
which would make public communications on IA matters would raise the awareness of the IA&#13;
function. It was also envisaged that this professional presence could sanction members which&#13;
failed to meet the professional standards.&#13;
&#13;
2. Organisation and governance framework&#13;
There were suggestions for the establishment of an IA agency in the public sector to oversee IA&#13;
quality and manage and protect IA independence, and also for Audit Committees to be an&#13;
requirement in both the public and private sectors.&#13;
&#13;
The IA function must become more organised and structure its processes:&#13;
     · Annual Audit Coverage Planning: determine audit universe ­ as there is usually a host of&#13;
         audit assignments, different views and needs, management and the IA function need to sit&#13;
         down and prioritise and obtain formal sanction for the plan at the Audit Committee. The&#13;
         IA function also needs to consider which effectiveness/efficiency reviews ("Value For&#13;
         Money") would improve the service delivery of the organisation and thus could raise&#13;
         awareness of the added value of IA&#13;
     · Assignment Planning&#13;
     · Risk Assessment (together with management identify functional areas, risk areas, risks,&#13;
         risk elements, prioritize risk and risk elements) to achieve a risk profile&#13;
     · Control Assurance: establish, test, monitor and assess controls&#13;
     · Reporting key findings and recommendations against the risk profile&#13;
&#13;
It is important to implement arrangements for the IA function to be more effective, such as:&#13;
     · True independence: a formal mandate and authority from the Board / Audit Committee to&#13;
         audit anything in their professional opinion that impacts on the effectiveness of&#13;
         governance, risk management and control processes; does it have its own budget and can&#13;
         the IA manager dispose of this as he/she sees fit, who appoints the IA manager?&#13;
     · Have a good understanding of issues facing the organization: i.e. is the IA function in a&#13;
         position to understand the challenges management face on a daily basis and structure its&#13;
         work accordingly?&#13;
     · Be responsive to management's needs&#13;
     · Be able to assess, advise and assure the management of key business risks&#13;
     · Contribute to performance improvement&#13;
     · Be proactive in communication with management&#13;
     · Recommendations are implemented&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12      Cecilia Nordin Van Gansberghe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     · Match the skills set to the needs: does the manager have the possibility of letting staff go&#13;
         and recruit competent staff, can he/she plan and implement a training plan, allow funds&#13;
         for certification, etc.&#13;
     · Use enabling technology and work smarter&#13;
&#13;
3. Legislation&#13;
A legal framework embedding IA in the public sector should be established, with specific sign-&#13;
off requirements for IA. Standards set up by the Institute for Internal Auditors should be adopted&#13;
in a way most suitable for the individual country. The legislation should clearly set out the&#13;
requirement for Internal Audit and the appropriate governance arrangements, such as an Audit&#13;
Committee and its role and operations. There should be a requirement that the Head of Internal&#13;
Audit be an member of IIA, with appropriate professional qualifications.&#13;
&#13;
The Forum was fully conscious of laws taking time to come into effect and that laws will merely&#13;
spawn efforts to circumvent them if an ethical climate does not prevail. Furthermore, it is more&#13;
useful if IA regulation can be part of larger PFM legislative efforts, i.e. the IA function must&#13;
follow PFM legal developments closely to be able to insert proper arrangements for IA.&#13;
&#13;
4. Professionalisation&#13;
To be a professional means recognition among peers and outsiders of one's services and&#13;
qualifications, which have been earned by hard work. Furthermore, you must be relevant and see&#13;
to it that you continue to be so by continously updating yourself. A professional is proud to work&#13;
in his/her chosen profession and to belong to a community of professionals, where it is clear that&#13;
you live and work within defined standards. A professional, looking to develop, must have career&#13;
prospects.&#13;
&#13;
Civil service has been and is still in some places, a job for life, where you follow set advancement&#13;
based on number of years in service, not merit, achievement or education. There may be an&#13;
entrance exam or you enter by recommendation, after which point you can calmly wait for&#13;
retirement, while drawing a small salary. This may contribute to the fact that many staff resist&#13;
change, since it will only mean additional work without any possibility of advance on merit.&#13;
&#13;
Within the larger picture of civil service reform, the IA has some particular points to address:&#13;
     · IA is part of "overhead" costs, which has contributed to it being seen as non-contributing&#13;
         to the organisaiton's outputs and service delivery&#13;
     · It may be that not everybody would endorse a more professional IA function, which&#13;
         would make it more effective and independent&#13;

&#13;
The Forum dedicated quite some time to discuss the self-image many internal auditors have.&#13;
Auditors are hesitant to reveal their profession to outsiders, due to to several factors: it is seen as&#13;
boring, as part of a repressive system19, in some places the IA function is a last recourse for staff&#13;
who have not performed well, etc. It is therefore of utmost importance to raise awareness of the&#13;
fact that internal auditors form a very well respected and useful profession globally and belonging&#13;
to this group is a reason to be proud. This is both important for the individual auditor as well as&#13;
for the IA function, since a proud auditor will act as an ambassador for the profession and raise&#13;
awareness of modern IA among his/her contacts. There was solid support for building strong&#13;
professional bodies to support both IA and auditors.&#13;
&#13;
Some practical suggestions for certification and training included learnerships, to introduce&#13;
internal auditor qualifications, to have degree/diploma programs at university level, establishment&#13;
of formal CPE/qualification programs, skills gap assessment and development of appropriate&#13;
catch-up initiatives and keep track of competencies need for Value for Money audits.&#13;
&#13;
5. Conceptual framework&#13;
As stated by Diamond20, both INTOSAI and IIA "have issued auditing standards to guide the&#13;
auditing and accounting professions". These standards, having widely been accepted as&#13;
encapsulating "best practices", most countries will adopt standards that conform to them. The&#13;
&#13;
19As a comparison on can note the following: Ms. V.H. Lundgren, author of the Swedish Governement&#13;
Official Report on IA, in the publication "internrevision" 2003/3 answered the question "What is the worst&#13;
part of IA?" by saying "It is probably when one as internal auditor is not always seen as supporting the&#13;
organisation, in spite of this being the overriding goal for our work. The organisation can experience it as&#13;
annoying when faults are discovered but our reason for doing it is to assist in making improvements"&#13;

Consultative Forum wanted the IIA framework to be adopted and to find acceptance in the public&#13;
and private sectors. Furthermore, guidelines for assuring IA independence, including the&#13;
appointment of the Head of Internal Audit, should be formulated.&#13;
&#13;
6. Resources&#13;
The IA function needs to develop well-motivated funding requirements. These should give access&#13;
to national and donor funds. Furthermore, in order to establish a professional body, that would be&#13;
an affiliate of the IIA, each country should develop plans that show the ultimate self-&#13;
sustainability of this professional body, as the countries estimated that a permanent presence was&#13;
required.&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
The Forum concluded with the participating countries formulating time-lined action plans to&#13;
improve the situation for and image of internal audit in their countries. The participants agreed to&#13;
form task forces for advancing the action plans in their countries. Common to all the country-&#13;
specific actions plans were&#13;
    · The need for an governance framework, to support effective internal audit ­ an important&#13;
         objective for the task forces is to ensure that IA is fully taken onboard in the growing&#13;
         governance frameworks&#13;
    · The participating countries are presently undertaking PFM reforms ­ IA needs to be fully&#13;
         integrated&#13;
    · The establishment of Audit Committees was identified as a key governance requirement&#13;
    · Each country needs to have a permanent IIA secretariat office to support the development&#13;
         of the profession in the country. Once established, this office needs to be very active to&#13;
         promote IA professionalisation.&#13;
    · Certification and training is a common need&#13;
&#13;
Each country identified specific actions with timelines in the Forum. These plans were then&#13;
further elaborated by the task force on return. The World Bank and the IIA will continue to&#13;
support the development of IA and mechanisms to monitor the action plans.&#13;
&#13;
                                             ***********&#13;
&#13;
Finally, to illustrate that the concerns voiced at the Forum echo globally in what seems to be a&#13;
very different setting, Box 5 details the results of a recent survey of public internal auditors in&#13;
Sweden. Questions on certification, remuneration, CPE, quality assurance and independence are&#13;
some of the questions where similarities can be found and thus, grounds for mutually enhancing&#13;
co-operation.&#13;

&#13;
Box 5: Results of a Survey Among Public Internal Auditors 2002&#13;
As input to the Swedish Government Official Report on IA, a survey was made of the situation&#13;
for public internal auditors, carried out by the Swedish IIA affliate. 85% of public IA entities&#13;
were represented in the survey. The large majority had a university level education and have&#13;
worked more than 10 years in the profession and in the public sector. Most worked in small units:&#13;
22% did IA alone, 28 worked with 2-4 auditors and only 27% did their job in units larger than 5&#13;
staff. A large majority did not want to use CIA as a certification due to its being formulated for&#13;
American conditions and being in English, some also thought it too expensive for their training&#13;
budgets. Most wanted a nationally adapted exam. A certified auditor should get salary&#13;
compensation for this qualifications to both motivate auditor to certification and to encourage&#13;
them to stay. Some thought that not all auditor needed to qualify, others that all should qualify in&#13;
order not to have an A team and a B team. The more years an auditor has worked in his/her&#13;
profession the more interested they are in a diversified CPE offering. Most want more courses in&#13;
practical audit methodology formulated for the public sector, in order to capture the specificity of&#13;
the sector. 95% are of the opinion that IA quality assurance is vital. A majority wanted a model&#13;
specifically formulated for the Swedish public sector, with a pedagogical slant to further&#13;
improvements (and not sanctions). One half thinks the quality control should be made by external&#13;
entities, while others approve of colleagues doing it (but one half indicates that they do not have&#13;
to time to audit others). An overwhelming majority wanted the board to appoint internal auditors&#13;
(minimun the IA manager, but some wanted all internal auditors appointed by the board) and set&#13;
the salary for the IA manager. An even larger majority was of the opinion that the board should&#13;
set the IA budget.&#13;

            Internal audit: finding its place in public
            finance management
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            For centuries, internal audit was a
            simple administrative procedure of checking documents,
            counting assets, and reporting on past events to various
            types of management. Several forces in our times have led to
            a quiet revolution in internal audit. Democracy requires
            government to be accountable in its use of public money and
            in providing effective, efficient, and economical service
            delivery. Ever larger and more complex systems require
            greater competencies, thus internal audit has had to become
            ever more professional. Sheer size also brings with it the
            need to assess risk, deploying scarce resources in the most
            logical manner to address those risks.
