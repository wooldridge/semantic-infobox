&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systems â&#128;&#147; in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Burkina Faso, political will has been the determining        is on track (based on data reported by the Joint Monitoring&#13;
factor behind the significant progress made in the water        Programme). The situation is particularly acute for both&#13;
supply and sanitation sector. The country, amongst the          rural and urban sanitation.&#13;
poorest in the world, committed itself to the sector&#13;
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets by                    The major challenge still to be overcome is that&#13;
progressively putting a programmatic approach in place          of decentralization and the local management of&#13;
which culminated in the approval of the National Program        water supply and sanitation (WSS) services. All local&#13;
for Water Supply and Sanitation by 2015 (PN-AEPA 2015).         management stakeholders, including the contracting&#13;
The country has gained the trust and support of several         authority, the commune (local authorities), the regional&#13;
development partners (DPs), some of whom have recently          technical departments that should support them, as well&#13;
committed to providing sectoral budget support for water        as the water usersâ&#128;&#153; associations and the local private&#13;
and sanitation.                                                 sector, suffer from a severe lack of human, technical, and&#13;
                                                                financial resources that prevents them from successfully&#13;
The prospects in terms of investment up to 2015 are good:       undertaking their new responsibilities and ensuring that&#13;
the commitments made by the government are on the               investment is sustainable.&#13;
increase and those of development partners are stable.&#13;
Financing of the PN-AEPA investment program (the scope          Weaknesses in the monitoring and evaluation system for&#13;
of which is broader than that of the MDG targets alone) is      sanitation mean that it is difficult to fully register progress&#13;
on the right track, provided that the current pace at which     made and identify those communes with lowest coverage.&#13;
finance is mobilized is sustained and that the government,      This also makes it difficult to differentiate good versus poor&#13;
with the support of the DPs, invests further in promoting       approaches and so share any lessons learned. Moreover,&#13;
household sanitation, as this area is still overlooked at       these weaknesses mean that donors are more reticent to&#13;
present.                                                        commit further funds to the subsector.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                             Water Supply and Sanitation in Burkina Faso: Turning Finance into Services for 2015 and Beyond&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
 Sectorwide&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Finance the implementation of the Human Resources Development Plan of the General Directorates for Water Resources&#13;
      (DGRE) and Wastewater, Sanitation and Human Excreta (DGAEUE), and the Regional Directorate for Agriculture,&#13;
      Water and Fisheries (DRAHRH).&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Develop and implement a plan to build on the communesâ&#128;&#153; human, material and financial capacities to enable them to&#13;
      assume their new responsibilities for water supply and sanitation.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Continue to mobilize internal and external resources, particularly for household sanitation in rural areas.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Improve the process for monitoring and evaluating the use of finance by involving all stakeholders: central government&#13;
      (ministry in charge of water and sanitation, finance ministry) and regional departments, development partners (DPs),&#13;
      nongovernmental organizations, communes, and the private sector.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Improve and simplify public procurement procedures.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Ensure consistency in the standards and definitions used to calculate water supply and sanitation coverage by the DGRE/&#13;
      DGAEUE, the state-owned company ONEA, and the National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INSD) in particular.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Conduct a household survey to establish reliable baseline data for access to improved sanitation.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Within the ministry in charge of water and sanitation, design and implement a standardized process for collecting,&#13;
      processing and communicating data related to the planning and monitoring of facilities, based on the Finance Law&#13;
      development timetable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Rural water supply&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Expand the management reform of rural water supply systems to all regions.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Rapidly increase the human, financial, and material resources made available to communes and regional departments&#13;
    to enable them to undertake the new responsibilities entrusted to them as part of the decentralization process.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Reinforce the competencies of water usersâ&#128;&#153; associations and the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Urban water supply&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Increase the quantity of water produced (collected, treated, and distributed) in the 14 secondary centers where there&#13;
    is a shortfall.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Improve the billing process by ensuring payments are collected from central administration and local authorities on&#13;
    time.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Continue to implement the recommendations from ONEAâ&#128;&#153;s 9001/2000 certification audit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Rapidly increase the finance allocated to leveraging household sanitation improvements.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Conduct an analysis of the main factors underlying the success and failure of past interventions to find more effective&#13;
    ways of stimulating demand and of promoting sanitation to increase the construction rate of facilities and, ultimately,&#13;
    to create and disseminate process guidelines for sanitation and hygiene projects.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Initiate a hygiene and sanitation promotional campaign at household level, on a long-term national scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Develop pit emptying services and wastewater and excreta treatment capacities in urban centers.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Find realistic technical and financial solutions to accompany the development of sewerage systems in Ouagadougou&#13;
    and in Bobo-Dioulasso bearing in mind the (low) demand for such a service, the capacity of domestic and industrial&#13;
    users to pay, and the need to achieve sustainable financial stability in the subsector.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Mobilize the necessary funding to implement Strategic Sanitation Plans in the secondary centers and unplanned&#13;
    settlements of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.                                                                     3&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in&#13;
collaboration with the Government of Burkina Faso and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

    Coverage and Finance Trends&#13;
&#13;
Coverage: Assessing Past Progress                                 Figure 1 is based on combined rural and urban data. These&#13;
                                                                  averages therefore conceal large differences in coverage&#13;
According to the statistics produced for the National             between the situation in urban and in rural areas. While&#13;
Program for Water Supply and Sanitation (PN-AEPA) and             the scale of these differences varies depending on whether&#13;
population data gathered during the 2004 administrative           the figures used are those provided by the ministry in&#13;
census,3 Burkina Faso is unlikely to meet the target it set for   charge of water and sanitation or those of the JMP (see&#13;
the drinking water sector: coverage stood at 59 percent in        Sections 7 to 10), the general assessment is the same:&#13;
2008, with the target set at 79 percent for 2015. The Joint       rural areas, where 81 percent of the population resides,&#13;
Monitoring Programme (JMP) figures,4 however, suggest             are clearly lagging behind urban areas in terms of access&#13;
that, with coverage of 76 percent in 2008, Burkina Faso           to water supply and sanitation (WSS) services.&#13;
exceeded the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target&#13;
of 72 percent. If the current pace of progress is sustained       Investment Requirements: Testing the&#13;
up to 2015, the country will therefore easily exceed this         Sufficiency of Finance&#13;
target (Figure 1).5 It should be noted, however, that the&#13;
definitions and calculation methods used by the JMP are           The Burkinabe government estimated the investment&#13;
different from those used in the PN-AEPA, which explains          requirements of the WSS sector when the PN-AEPA was&#13;

For sanitation, the government statistics match those of          on the 2015 targets. As far as sanitation is concerned, the&#13;
the JMP: with coverage of around 10 percent in 2008, the          scope of the government estimate is broader than that&#13;
country is highly unlikely to reach the sector target of 55       of the MDG. It also includes greywater collection facilities&#13;

centers, and public places), as well as training and hygiene                     investment, the same cannot be said for sanitation. This&#13;

According to this government estimate, US$1,085 million                          and institutional sanitation (rural areas) or for greywater&#13;
would be required to finance all investment planned                              treatment (urban areas), two types of services that are&#13;
between 2007 and 2015 for the drinking water subsectors                          not included in the coverage calculations.8 Factoring in&#13;

This brief introduction puts the service delivery pathway          result can be attributed to the National Office for Water&#13;
in context, which can then be explored in detail using             and Sanitation (ONEA) which, in the 1990s, transformed&#13;
the CSO2 scorecard, an assessment tool providing a                 itself into a highly capable state company with the ability&#13;

functions classified in three categories: three functions          integration of both water and sanitation under its sole&#13;

sustaining these services (facility maintenance, extension         peer-group comparison&#13;
of infrastructure, use of the service).13 Each building block&#13;
is assessed against specific indicators and scored from 1                                       Enabling&#13;

The scorecard results for Burkina Faso show, first, that&#13;
the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s enabling political and institutional context&#13;
has been considerably strengthened over the last decade,&#13;
placing Burkina Faso well above the average of other African&#13;
low-income countries with a gross national income (GNI)&#13;
below US$500 per capita (World Bank Atlas Method, see&#13;

DPs for the sector are DANIDA (Denmark), the World Bank,                challenges in terms of mobilizing resources and developing&#13;
the AfDB, AFD (France), KfW/DED/GTZ (Germany), UNICEF,                  water supply and sanitation services are greater here. In&#13;

Overall, the public expenditure review of 2008 showed that              Commitments are compared to actual disbursements&#13;

(the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s own funds and donor commitments                       shows that an average of 80 percent of domestic capital&#13;
other than from NGOs) has increased considerably over                   commitments has been utilized over the last three years. This&#13;
the last few years, rising from US$27.4 million in 2001                 is substantially higher than expenditure from official donor&#13;
to US$61.6 million in 2007. This rise has translated into a             commitments, which is around 53 percent, with a lower&#13;
proportional increase in the number of facilities built and             rate for loans than for grants. This low utilization rate can&#13;
coverage raised.19 The prospects for financing are relatively           be explained both by the procurement procedures, which&#13;
stable: whereas some donors have reduced their aid as a                 are slow and centralized in Ouagadougou, as well as by the&#13;
result of the global financial crisis, others have maintained           cumbersome processes required by a subset of donors.&#13;

DGRE, through their reporting mechanism on physical             transmit comprehensive and reliable data on their new&#13;
output, calculate coverage by measuring the proportion          constructions and rehabilitations; the functionality of the&#13;
of the population with theoretical access to these              facilities is not specified and it is not known whether these&#13;
improved facilities, regardless of whether they actually use    conform to government or JMP standards. This makes it&#13;
them or not.                                                    difficult to target priority areas, estimate investment costs&#13;

The third issue is the criteria used to define what             several departments within the DGRE are charged with&#13;
is meant by â&#128;&#152;having access to an improved source of             collecting monitoring data. They use different methods and&#13;
drinking water and to improved sanitation facilitiesâ&#128;&#153;, as       timeframes, making it difficult to compare their figures.&#13;
there is no consistency between the DGRE/DGAEUE,                For urban water supply, it is also difficult to account for&#13;
ONEA, INSD, and the JMP. In particular, for sanitation, the     those water points constructed by actors other than the&#13;
latrines that the DGAEUE considers to be improved do not        ONEA in unplanned settlements and on the outskirts of&#13;
exactly correspond to the JMP standards (pit latrine with       secondary centers placed under ONEA responsibility.&#13;
washable slab), which in turn are not included in the INSD&#13;
household survey questionnaires. As a result, there are         For sanitation, facilities constructed by households&#13;
significant variations in the access data and there is no up-   independent of projects and the PSA are not included and&#13;
to-date or reliable coverage data available for sanitation.     those built by NGOs are either not included systematically&#13;
As far as calculating water supply coverage is concerned,       or are included, but imprecisely.&#13;
in contrast to the JMP, the DGRE includes the water quality&#13;
and the functionality of the water point and excludes all       To improve monitoring and reporting for the construction&#13;
rainwater harvesting facilities and protected springs.          of water supply facilities in the field, the government has&#13;

The fourth issue is due to the difficulty of monitoring         village. The same needs to be done soon for sanitation. In&#13;
the work carried out in the field. As far as rural water        time, this will mean that the facilitiesâ&#128;&#153; database can be&#13;

           Priority actions for rural water supply&#13;
           â&#128;¢	   Continue development of the PCD-AEPAs, ensuring planning is based on demand, and accelerate their&#13;
                implementation (DGRE with financial support from the DPs).&#13;
           â&#128;¢	   Expand management reform of rural water supply systems to all regions (by 2015).&#13;
           â&#128;¢	   Rapidly increase the human, financial, and material resources made available to communes and the DRAHRH&#13;
                to enable them to undertake the new responsibilities entrusted to them as part of the decentralization&#13;
                process (MAHRH).&#13;
           â&#128;¢	   Build the capacities of all actors, not only the communes and the DRAHRH who do not currently benefit&#13;
                from training, but also the water usersâ&#128;&#153; associations and the private sector. Training activities need to be&#13;
                expanded and standardized (MAHRH, at best from 2010).&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Burkina Faso
            : turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            and what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with United Nations
            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization
            (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This second CSO
            report has been produced in collaboration with the
            Government of Burkina Faso and other stakeholders during
            2009-10. The analysis aims to help countries assess their
            own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water
            supply and sanitation services in each of four subsectors:
            rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation
            and hygiene. The second CSO analysis has three main
            components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to
            assess the adequacy of future investments; and a scorecard
            which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the
            service delivery pathway. The second CSO's contribution
            is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance
            are sufficient to meet sector targets, but what specific
            issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively
            turned into accelerated coverage in water supply and
            sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have
            been identified through consultation. A synthesis report,
            available separately, presents best practice and shared
            learning to help realize these priority actions.
