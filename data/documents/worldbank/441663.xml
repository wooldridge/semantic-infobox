            Liberalizing telecommunications and the

        <abstracts>
            In February 1997, sixty-nine governments
            of high-income and developing countries agreed to liberalize
            their basic telecommunications services under an agreement
            negotiated through the World Trade Organization. Most
            participants in the agreement have subscribed to
            procompetitive regulatory principles, including independent
            regulators, competitive safeguards, measures to ensure
            interconnection, universal service obligations, and
            transparent and nondiscriminatory practices in licensing.
            The markets affected by the arrangement represent more than
            90 percent of the world market for telecommunications. The
            author reviews the evolution of the agreement and argues
            that the critical issues now are ensuring the quality of
            implementation and setting up a procompetitive regulatory environment.
