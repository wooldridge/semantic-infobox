            Interconnection disputes : antitrust or
            sector regulation and the case of New Zealand
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Full liberalization of
            telecommunications markets provides scope for relying
            largely on general antitrust rules and institutions for
            economic regulation. But at least for a time after
            liberalization, sector-specific rules and institutions are
            likely to be needed in some areas, including
            interconnection. This Note draws lessons from the experience
            of New Zealand. After fully liberalizing its
            telecommunications market in the late 1980s, the country
            relied primarily on antitrust instruments to regulate
            interconnection until 2001, when it introduced a new regime
            putting heavier emphasis on sector-specific regulation.
