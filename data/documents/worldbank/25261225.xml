between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in&#13;
this Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the&#13;
Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this&#13;
Administration Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank&#13;
under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard&#13;
policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to&#13;
prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to&#13;
give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter&#13;
of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations&#13;
of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive&#13;
orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall&#13;
be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may&#13;
be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as&#13;
trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2   The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United Sates Dollars he&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3   Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency&#13;
other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying&#13;
Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the&#13;
exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be&#13;
insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the&#13;
Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;

&#13;

disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment&#13;
of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to&#13;
the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;

funds in the Trust Fund, an amount equal to and not greater than thirty-five thousand United States&#13;

3.2   The Bank shall additionally deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to five percent (5%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the&#13;
Trust Fund from Ethiopia Productive Safety Net IVPartnership Multi Donor Trust Fund&#13;

deducted and retained for the Bank's own account from such Installment.&#13;

Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of&#13;
the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs&#13;
change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and&#13;
Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements&#13;
of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided&#13;
either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors&#13;
under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
