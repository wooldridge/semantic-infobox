            Privatization in developing countries : an
            analysis of the performance of newly privatized firms
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The privatization efforts of most
            developing countries are inhibited by embryonic financial
            markets, weak regulatory capacity, and a public sector that
            accounts for a large share of GDP. Many, particularly those
            with low per capita income, lack some of the main
            ingredients for a successful privatization, such as capital,
            entrepreneurs, and competent managers. But some of these
            countries have large markets and fast economic growth rates,
            features that make the success of government divestiture
            more likely. This Note describes the results of a study that
            set out to determine whether privatization is beneficial in
            the economic environments and institutional settings of
            these countries by examining how privatization affects
            firms' financial and operating performance in a broad
            set of developing countries.
