        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Regulating infrastructure utilities can
            be extremely complex and fraught with risks of political
            interference and capture by interest groups, especially in
            countries with little tradition of politically independent
            government agencies. To deal with these challenges,
            policymakers and regulators have sometimes contracted third
            parties-such as independent experts and consultants-to
            provide advisory or binding input into the administration of
            regulatory functions. This Note examines international
            experience in this area and explores the key implications
            for policymakers.
