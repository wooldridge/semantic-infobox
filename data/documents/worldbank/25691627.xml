    organized in case study countries&#13;

    √¢&#128;¬¢	 The specific ministry entities that form the               of transport with both multi-modal initiatives&#13;
       peak government entities in transport differ               as well as mode-specific components;&#13;
       because transport is often combined with&#13;
       other sectors (examples among the case study            √¢&#128;¬¢	 Most countries have a unit or department in the&#13;
       countries include telecommunications, land,                ministry responsible for freight logistics and in&#13;
       infrastructure, equipment, etc.);                          most cases this is responsible, along with other&#13;
                                                                  stakeholders, for producing a national logistics&#13;
    √¢&#128;¬¢	 The central transport ministries in each country           strategy (in Morocco the ministry has sponsored&#13;

       and regulatory oversight of the sector on a                Logistics Competitiveness);&#13;

                                                               √¢&#128;¬¢	 In three countries√¢&#128;&#148;Morocco, South Africa, and&#13;
    √¢&#128;¬¢	 In some cases, particular executive functions              South Korea√¢&#128;&#148;the ministry√¢&#128;&#153;s responsibilities&#13;
       of government with regard to transport                     are organized administratively by mode and&#13;
       infrastructure provision, regulation or operations         in two√¢&#128;&#148;Chile and Finland√¢&#128;&#148;by function. This&#13;
       are carried out by agencies associated with                distinction is perhaps not as great as it seems&#13;
       or reporting to the ministry. For example,                 as those organized by mode have functional&#13;
       in Finland there is a single comprehensive                 departments within them, and those organized&#13;
       transport agency plus a corresponding transport            by function have some mode-specific units in&#13;

&amp;#12;     II. Governance&#13;
     WHAT IS GOVERNANCE?&#13;
&#13;
     Most prior definitions of governance relate to         prices); corporate forms of entities administering&#13;
     governance of states as a whole (state governance)     the sector and delivering services; degree of&#13;
     or they deal with the detailed governance              community participation in the oversight function;&#13;
     arrangements of individual enterprises (corporate      and other dimensions.&#13;
     governance). This study focused on an area&#13;
     between these, that is, on the transport sector        The evolution of transport sector governance&#13;
     (and its modal sub-sectors). It was necessary to       in each country has taken place in a context of&#13;
     adopt a more specific definition.                      larger changes in public sector management as a&#13;
                                                            whole beginning in 1980s. Some of the key trends&#13;
     The study interpreted public governance of the         have been: privatization, e.g. sale of government&#13;
     transport sector as the legal framework and public     business entities and the rise of contracting out;&#13;
     institutions by which public policy oversight of the   competition, e.g. between different suppliers of&#13;
     transport sector is exercised and government roles     transport services or between transport suppliers&#13;
     performed. It considered √¢&#128;&#156;good√¢&#128;&#157; governance as a        bidding for exclusive public contracts; and&#13;
     means to transform national transport strategies       devolution, with decisions on service delivery&#13;
     and policies into successful outcomes, meeting         devolved from central department to localized or&#13;
     the citizens√¢&#128;&#153; transport needs, and contributing        arms-length service delivery entities (sometimes&#13;
     to the country√¢&#128;&#153;s long-term development goals. It       referred to as √¢&#128;&#156;subsidiarity√¢&#128;&#157;). Over the past two&#13;
     shared the view (expressed by the United Nations       decades, the transport sectors in many countries,&#13;
     Development Programme) that good governance            including the case studies, have undergone&#13;
     should also be √¢&#128;&#156;participatory, transparent, and        extensive organizational reforms, partly inspired&#13;
     accountable.√¢&#128;&#157;                                          by the above trends. Recent experiences suggest&#13;
                                                            some recentralization of higher-level governance&#13;
     The legal framework and public institutions of         functions, especially in complex sectors with&#13;
     the transport sector can be constructed around a       network implications and high public visibility such&#13;
     number of different policy alternatives: ownership     as transport, but usually retaining clear separation&#13;
     of transport system assets (public or private);        from the delivery side of transport services, and&#13;
     role of public and private sectors in transport        often used by ministries of agency structures to&#13;
     infrastructure and services management; type           administer executive functions such as day-to-&#13;
     and degree of economic regulation (i.e. of             day regulation and public infrastructure provision.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     SIGNIFICANCE OF GOVERNANCE&#13;
&#13;
     The success of any country√¢&#128;&#153;s transport system          Governance is therefore increasingly recognized&#13;
     does not (and should not) depend primarily on          as critical to the success of transportation&#13;
     sector governance, but instead on the competence       authorities. In 2005, a team of experts from the&#13;
     and hard work of managers and employees in             University of Toronto reviewed the factors that&#13;
     the transport industry who deliver transport           contribute to best practice in urban transport&#13;
     infrastructure and services. Nevertheless, sector      and concluded that the most critical requirement&#13;
     governance can have a significant influence            is effective governance√¢&#128;&#148;even more important&#13;
     on how well any country√¢&#128;&#153;s transport industry           than finance, infrastructure, and urban land-use&#13;
     responds to market demands and national policy         planning.&#13;
     goals. Sector governance creates the enabling&#13;
     environment for the transport industry: the            In    its   report    on    Transportation    for&#13;
     effectiveness of the government bodies with            Development, the World Bank asserts&#13;
     which it deals; the market freedoms that it is         √¢&#128;&#156;transport performance is not just a matter&#13;
     permitted; the regulatory constraints under which      of physical investment. Transport that&#13;
     it operates; the confidence with which it can plan     contributes positively to development and&#13;
12   long-term business initiatives and investments.        that is safe, clean, and affordable also depends&#13;
&amp;#12;on sector governance.√¢&#128;&#157;5 In the 2000 European&#13;
Commission communication on transport,&#13;
governance is considered a prerequisite to&#13;
sustainable development of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Irrespective of specific policies, the World Bank&#13;
has identified a number of indicators that have&#13;
been generally found to be consistent with good&#13;
practice in discharging the governance function.6&#13;
These are shown in Table 2.1. In theory, principles&#13;
of good governance apply universally. In practice,&#13;
countries think and act differently. While the&#13;
principles of effectiveness and integrity are&#13;
equally valid everywhere, accountability practices&#13;
often tend to differ. Countries often differ with&#13;
respect to the balance between using the public&#13;
sector versus the private sector to achieve their&#13;
goals. Another area in which differences arise&#13;
is in the involvement of communities and end&#13;
users in decision-making. Variations in practice&#13;
can be explained by the different histories,&#13;
culture, and circumstances of each country. These&#13;
variations are also affected by different systems&#13;
and traditions for decision-making over policy,&#13;
planning, and budgeting. These are intimately&#13;
tied to the nature of government, the character of&#13;
leaders and the political elite, and the main source&#13;
of government revenues (taxes, natural resources,&#13;
etc.).7 That being said, there is an opportunity to&#13;
learn from what occurs internationally. The phrase&#13;
√¢&#128;&#156;one size doesn√¢&#128;&#153;t fit all√¢&#128;&#157; should not be interpreted&#13;
as encouragement to claim national uniqueness&#13;
as justification for ignoring practices that have&#13;
proven effective.&#13;

√¢&#128;&#156;the job of a Transport Ministry is to regulate         forms of regulation can be classified into four&#13;

&amp;#12;     STRUCTURE OF PAPER&#13;
&#13;
     The remainder of the paper describes how&#13;
     transport sub-sectors are organized in the five&#13;
     case study countries dealing respectively with:&#13;
     the peak governance entity, typically a Ministry of&#13;
     Transport or equivalent (Section 3) and the central&#13;
     functions of regulatory administration; ports&#13;
     (Section 4); railways (Section 5); roads (Section 6);&#13;
     and public transport (Section 7). It gives particular&#13;
     attention to structural, institutional, and financing&#13;
     dimensions. The main lessons learned from this&#13;
     collective experience are summarized in Section 8.&#13;

     Level&#13;
Each of the case study countries has a different       material, and World Bank country sources. In&#13;
ministry structure at the apex of governance of        some cases the ministries are responsible for&#13;
the transport sector. This section provides an         governance in other sectors but the descriptions&#13;

relevant legislation, rules, and standards. The        ports, roads, irrigation structures, and architectural&#13;
ministry is comprised of the country√¢&#128;&#153;s transport       services. MOP has a territorially decentralized&#13;
department, telecommunications department,             organizational structure with regional directorates&#13;
and civil aeronautical board. In addition, it serves   and provincial offices. MOP has an establishment&#13;

MOP√¢&#128;&#153;s responsibilities cover a wide span of public     installing various road safety features, e.g., signs,&#13;
infrastructure, including inter-urban highways,        barriers, and overheads. Likewise, the MINVU is&#13;
rural and urban roads, bridges, ferry landings,        responsible for ensuring that the design of urban&#13;
ports, and airports, besides water resources           streets conforms to road safety standards.&#13;

SOUTH KOREA&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport       for aviation in South Korea. Established in 1948, it&#13;
(MOLIT) has the overall policy, regulatory, and          has been reorganized several times in the past two&#13;
funding mandate for all land transport modes and         decades as the economy has expanded and the            19&#13;
&amp;#12;     role of the public sector has evolved. The ministry    for the administration, planning, construction, and&#13;
     was originally the Ministry of Transport, then         maintenance of public roads and also supervises&#13;
     the Ministry of Construction and Transportation,       the Korea Expressway Corporation. It serves as&#13;
     then the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime      the central road agency of the government, where&#13;
     Affairs. The latest reorganization in 2013             all policies related to public roads are formulated&#13;
     resulted in the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and   and all plans by various road agencies are&#13;
     Transport and excluded maritime affairs.               reviewed and approved. The provincial and local&#13;

     MOLIT describes its mandate as covering                of their respective road networks under MOLIT√¢&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     future-oriented territorial development, safe          supervision.&#13;
     and convenient infrastructure, and transport&#13;
     development. It is staffed by 956 officials.13         MOLIT also has overall responsibility for transport&#13;
     MOLIT√¢&#128;&#153;s organizational structure (under a Cabinet      safety (other than maritime safety) and in the&#13;
     minister) has two main functional streams: (a) land    roads sector shares road safety responsibility with&#13;
     and infrastructure and (b) transport, each headed      the Ministry of Public Administration and Security&#13;
     by a vice minister. The transport stream has           and the National Police Agency. As an extension&#13;
     four branches√¢&#128;&#148;a Transport and Logistics Office         of its transport regulatory responsibilities,&#13;

&#13;
     COMMON THEMES&#13;
&#13;
     There are many differences in the specific             Most countries have a unit or department in the&#13;
     ministry entities that form the peak government        ministry that is responsible for freight logistics.&#13;
     entities in transport in the five countries, but       In most cases, this is responsible, with other&#13;
     also some common patterns as indicated in              stakeholders, for producing a national logistics&#13;
     Figure 3.1.                                            strategy [in Morocco the ministry has sponsored&#13;
                                                            a specialist Agency for the Development of&#13;
     The central transport ministries in each country       Logistics Competitiveness (AMDL)].&#13;
     have, with few exceptions, national strategy,&#13;
     policy, and regulatory oversight of the sector         Figure 3.2 summarizes (with some simplification)&#13;
     on a multi-modal basis. All the countries use a        the responsibilities for administering economic&#13;
     mission statement and four have published a            and safety regulation in each country, recognizing&#13;
     National Transport Strategy covering all modes of      that the central ministry itself is responsible for&#13;
     transport containing both multi-modal initiatives      establishing the high-level regulatory policies&#13;
     as well as mode-specific components.                   that shape the regulatory function.&#13;
&#13;
     In some cases particular executive functions with&#13;
     regard to infrastructure provision, regulation or&#13;
     operations are carried out by agencies reporting&#13;
     to the ministry, especially in Finland (where there&#13;
     is a single comprehensive transport agency) and&#13;
     South Africa (which has a series of specialist&#13;
     transport agencies).&#13;
&#13;
     In three countries the ministry√¢&#128;&#153;s responsibilities&#13;
     are organized administratively by mode and in&#13;
     two by function, though the distinction is perhaps&#13;
     not as great as it seems as those organized by&#13;
     mode have functional departments within them,&#13;
     and those by function have some mode-specific&#13;
     units in their internal organizations.&#13;

     were changed to isolate port administrations                  to achieve a balance between private sector&#13;
     from undue political and bureaucratic influences.             operational efficiency and the public interest&#13;

26   Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators&#13;
&amp;#12;Tanger-Med and Busan serve larger vessels than&#13;
the other three ports. The lower performance of&#13;
Helsinki reflects lower overall cargo volumes and&#13;
relatively more land, crane, and berth availability&#13;
than is actually required for the current volumes.&#13;
Durban also performs lower than world averages&#13;
for TEUs per gantry crane and TEUs per hectare,&#13;
suggesting slower moves per crane hour or an&#13;
excessive number of cranes as well as either&#13;
excessive land or lower density storage. Lower&#13;
density storage means the cycle time for&#13;
movement to storage is also likely to be higher as&#13;
the yard equipment has to move farther from the&#13;
cranes at the berth.&#13;
&#13;
A more detailed analysis with a larger sample of&#13;
ports would be required to draw firm conclusions&#13;
about the relationship of port performance to each&#13;
country√¢&#128;&#153;s port institutional framework. However,&#13;
given the countries under study here, generally&#13;
those ports that have private sector participation,&#13;
competition (e.g. Valparaiso, Tanger-Med, and&#13;
Busan), and greater commercial autonomy at arms&#13;
length from political influences seem to perform&#13;
better than those ports that do not reflect these&#13;
characteristics. As earlier noted, a corporatized&#13;
state-owned monopoly operator serves South&#13;
Africa√¢&#128;&#153;s ports, while Finland√¢&#128;&#153;s gateway port of&#13;
Helsinki is subject to municipal governance. As&#13;
shown in Table 4.3, these two ports perform well&#13;
below world averages as indicated by the average&#13;
scores of the three indicators compared to the&#13;
world indicators.&#13;

     BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
     In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the advent              or more operators who are either publicly- or&#13;
     of railways represented a quantum improvement                 privately owned.&#13;
     over most forms of land transport. With that&#13;
     market power, railways rapidly developed around            Historically, public railway services in many&#13;
     the world regardless of the type of governance             countries20 were effectively delivered by a&#13;
     or method of management. Most government                   government ministry or department, which&#13;
     intervention was designed to control the monopoly          combined policy-making, regulation, and service&#13;
     power of railways, either through direct ownership         delivery in a single body. Others were constituted&#13;
     or through regulation of prices and services.              as state enterprises, generally created by statute.&#13;
                                                                Some statutory authorities have governance&#13;
     In due course, motorized road freight and road             structures that resemble a company in the form&#13;
     and airline passenger transport eroded the                 of a board and management that are (often)&#13;
     market power and dominance of railways. In                 independent from day-to-day intervention by&#13;
     many cases the railway industry and government             the government. Nevertheless, governments&#13;
     policies for railways were slow to adapt to the            generally set down a robust framework to publicly&#13;
     new competitive environment. Competition from              steer the strategic direction of such authorities.&#13;
     other modes, especially from road transport,               Some still remain, but in many countries, railway&#13;
     led to significant diversion of passengers and             departments or authorities have been converted&#13;

     The varying impact of market changes, as well as           varies widely from country to country. Some&#13;
     government and industry responses to them, has             countries have a single operator while others have&#13;
     led to a wide range of institutional arrangements          several; some have separate passenger and freight&#13;
     around the world. Three varying characteristics of         operators, while others also have infrastructure&#13;
     these arrangements are:                                    companies; some have private companies and&#13;
                                                                some remain all publicly-owned. However, the&#13;

        governance in a unitary ministry;                       services. The main structural variants having this&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
       ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RAILWAY SYSTEMS&#13;
&#13;
     The five case studies provide a wide range of&#13;
     management models. Only one and a half (Morocco&#13;
     and northern Chile) are still vertically integrated&#13;
     in the sense that both infrastructure and train&#13;
     operations are undertaken by a single organization.&#13;
     However, even in Chile, there is provision in the&#13;
     current draft law for third parties to operate on&#13;
     payment of access charges. Of the others, two&#13;
     (southern Chile and South Africa) still combine&#13;
     infrastructure with some train operations√¢&#128;&#148;freight&#13;
     in the case of South Africa and passenger in&#13;
     the case of southern Chile√¢&#128;&#148;while third parties&#13;
     undertake other train operations. South Korea&#13;
     is integrated in the sense that infrastructure&#13;
     maintenance and operations are undertaken&#13;
     by the same organization responsible for train&#13;
     operations, but in this case the infrastructure is&#13;
     owned and ultimately managed by a third party,&#13;
     which contracts its maintenance and operations&#13;
     back to the railway.&#13;
&#13;
     Finally, Finland conforms to the EU model with&#13;
     separation of above-rail (passenger and freight)&#13;
     activities and infrastructure management. Sweden&#13;
     takes this one further and has separated the&#13;
     freight and passenger operators in independent&#13;
     companies. Germany has many third-party&#13;
     passenger and freight operators on its network&#13;
     but the dominant operators in both sectors are&#13;
     German railways√¢&#128;&#153; (DB) subsidiary companies, and&#13;
     these are in a common group structure with DB&#13;
     Netz, the infrastructure manager.&#13;

this is still through √¢&#128;&#156;deficit financing√¢&#128;&#157; basis, that     opportunity to operate commercially.&#13;
is, the government just pays the difference at&#13;
the end of the year. This does little to incentivize      In practice, the PSO approach is only as effective&#13;

the government understand why the deficit is              of the payments. These tend to be closely&#13;
occurring and what it is really paying for (e.g.          scrutinized by rigorous Finance Ministry officials&#13;

specific services that will be provided by the            it convenient, where they have the opportunity,&#13;
railway and setting a price for them that then            to just instruct the railway to cross-subsidize&#13;
forms a contract between the government (or               internally, as is almost certainly being done for KTX&#13;
local government) and the railway. As long as the         in South Korea, and from phosphates in Morocco&#13;

Africa has a sizeable network, comparable with        passenger business, as has Chile. South Africa has&#13;
Japan or Germany, with the others having 2,000-       by far the largest freight business, carrying over&#13;
6,000 km of track. South Korea has a large            200 million tonnes p.a., half of which is export&#13;
passenger business, carrying nearly 1 billion         coal and minerals. The other railways carry 10-40&#13;
suburban passengers and over 100 million long-        million tonnes p.a., with average hauls of 200-500&#13;
distance passengers but overall is only 10 percent    km.&#13;

     BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
     In most countries, road transport is the dominant     the spending on roads ranges from 1-3 percent&#13;
     mode of transport accounting for more than 80         of GDP, with the lower limit associated with&#13;
     percent of passenger-km and over 50 percent           industrialized countries (where much of the basic&#13;
     of freight tonne-km. Roads ensure spatial and         road infrastructure is in place) and the higher limit&#13;
     temporal connectivity, commonly expressed in          with developing countries in the expansionary&#13;
     indicators of accessibility and mobility. Typically   phase of infrastructure development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF ROADS&#13;
&#13;
     In nearly all countries, the ownership of the main       or municipal level by city governments or urban&#13;
     common-user public road network is vested by             councils;&#13;
     law in the state or in a state-owned agency. There    √¢&#128;¬¢	 Local access and community roads, which&#13;
     are also some privately owned or concessioned            sometimes remain unclassified, are managed&#13;
     roads, including high-performance expressways            by local governments/community roads&#13;
     (e.g. in Chile, Finland, Morocco, South Korea, and       associations.&#13;
     South Africa); roads linked to forestry (e.g. in&#13;
     Finland); mining roads (e.g. in Chile); plantation    The functions of a road administration can be split&#13;
     and agricultural roads; and rural and urban access    conveniently into:&#13;
     roads. In most countries, roads are administered&#13;
     directly by governments (including sub-national       Client function: Activities related to the planning&#13;
     levels of government) with capital investments        and management of road operations√¢&#128;&#148;the client&#13;
     and operations and maintenance (O&amp;M)                  role is concerned with specifying the activities to&#13;
     expenditures on main roads funded primarily           be carried out, determining appropriate standards,&#13;
     from the consolidated national budget. Revenues       commissioning works, supervising implementation,&#13;
     related to road use, such as taxes on fuel and        controlling works, and monitoring; and&#13;
     vehicle ownership, are typically deemed to be part&#13;
     of general revenues (only Morocco among the five      Supplier function: Activities related to execution&#13;
     case study countries has a dedicated Road Fund        of works√¢&#128;&#148;the supplier role is concerned with&#13;
     with earmarked taxes).                                delivering the defined road works to an agreed&#13;

     Based on some form of functional classification,&#13;
     the road network is typically divided into            Separating these clarifies roles and increases&#13;
     administrative classes:                               the focus and specificity of action, both of the&#13;

     √¢&#128;¬¢	 Major trunk roads (commonly designated as          Arrangements between the client and the supplier&#13;
        national roads), including expressways and toll    are normally defined in some form of contract. Both&#13;
        roads, are normally managed at the national        parties have incentives to increase operational&#13;
        level by a government department (as in Chile      performance. Greater benefits in effectiveness&#13;
        and Finland), and are often complemented           and efficiency have been achieved as a result of&#13;
        by a semi-autonomous public authority, or          such separation irrespective of the organizational&#13;
        an autonomous corporation/company (as in           structure and hierarchal dependencies. Finland and&#13;
        Morocco, South Africa, and South Korea).           South Africa (SANRAL) have a complete separation&#13;
     √¢&#128;¬¢	 Regional and rural roads are typically managed     between the client and supplier functions in&#13;
        at the sub-national level by state/provincial/     the construction and maintenance of road&#13;
        local governments; however, in Chile and           infrastructure; they have no in-house (force account)&#13;
        Finland, all roads are managed by the national     capacity for this purpose. Table 6.1 summarizes the&#13;
        roads/transport entity through decentralized       arrangements in each of the case study countries.&#13;
        regional departments;                              This table does not include the attributes of sub-&#13;
     √¢&#128;¬¢	 Urban roads, which may also include some toll      national road organizations at state, provincial or&#13;
34      roads, are normally managed at the metropolitan    municipal/local levels (e.g. in South Africa and South&#13;
&amp;#12;Korea). In Chile, Morocco, and South Korea, roads are    have a board of directors that often appoints&#13;
administered through a government department             the chief executive officer. In addition, some&#13;
within a ministry (except for expressways and            countries (e.g. Morocco, South Africa, and South&#13;
concessioned roads); while in Finland and South          Korea) are providing dedicated revenue sources&#13;
Africa, roads are administered through agencies          for these commercially oriented enterprises in&#13;
with an autonomous corporate structure. A                order for them to be (at least to some degree)&#13;
common feature of the road sector in all the five        independent managerially and free of the year-to-&#13;
countries is the use of private-public partnerships      year vicissitudes of national budget funding.&#13;
for provision and operation of expressways.&#13;
                                                         Many examples of such new management&#13;
While many road organizations operate as                 arrangements are working well: Austria has&#13;
government departments or agencies, an                   ASFINAG; Morocco has the Soci√É¬©t√É¬© Nationale des&#13;

     PERFORMANCE OF THE ROAD SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
     Common road system performance indicators                 and convenience. Advanced traffic management&#13;

     the incidence of road accidents and traffic fatalities,   traffic congestion to assess mobility (Finland and&#13;

Road traffic accidents are a major cause of death,&#13;
especially among young adults. In industrialized&#13;
countries, only about 15-20 percent of fatalities&#13;
involve pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles,&#13;
and motorcycles. In developing and transition&#13;
countries, the figure is closer to 50 percent and&#13;
is as high as 70 percent in Asia. In developing&#13;
and transition countries, road accident rates per&#13;
10,000 vehicles tend to be 10 to 20 times higher&#13;
than in industrialized countries and cost between&#13;
1.0-1.5 percent of GNP. A major challenge for all&#13;
road agencies in industrialized and developing&#13;
countries alike is to build safer and forgiving roads&#13;
that contain the scourge of road accident fatalities&#13;
and injuries. Fortunately more attention is being&#13;
paid to road accidents. Efforts are underway&#13;
to mobilize private finance for road safety&#13;
interventions and to set up accident reporting&#13;
systems to enable road safety interventions to be&#13;
planned and implemented more effectively.&#13;

FUNDING FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT&#13;

passengers, but it usually does not cover service-&#13;
operating costs, much less capital of vehicles           Beyond fare-paying customers and allocations of&#13;
and infrastructure. Most of the operating deficit        subsidies from the various levels of government,&#13;
is funded by the local governments (municipal or         there is the question of what other specific&#13;
metropolitan transport authorities) responsible          sources of funding might be dedicated for funding&#13;
for the service, and from transfers from either          public transport operations or infrastructure.&#13;

     PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT&#13;
&#13;
     The metropolitan populations of the principal           percent of work-related trips as compared to only&#13;
     cities in case study countries vary substantially,      14 percent in Johannesburg.&#13;
     ranging from slightly over 1 million (Helsinki) to&#13;
     over 20 million (Seoul). The scale and composition&#13;
     of the public transport systems serving these&#13;
     cities vary correspondingly. For example, the&#13;
     mass transit system30 of metropolitan Seoul is&#13;
     393 km in length as compared to only 21 km in&#13;
     Helsinki.&#13;

     transport systems in ascending order of city&#13;
     size. Care should be taken in comparing cities as&#13;
     statistical methods may differ. The performance&#13;
     of these systems varies both in qualitative and&#13;

&amp;#12;     VIII.            Lessons Learned&#13;
     Transport is a large and diverse economic sector          and in most cases this is responsible, with other&#13;
     encompassing passenger and freight operations,            stakeholders, for producing a national logistics&#13;
     urban and rural areas, public and private transport       strategy [in Morocco the ministry has sponsored&#13;
     sectors, economic and social needs, and domestic          a specialist Agency for the Development of&#13;
     and international markets. While this diversity           Logistics Competitiveness (AMDL)];&#13;
     exists in all countries, the scale and balance of&#13;

     systems and sector governance naturally differ. It         are organized administratively by mode and&#13;
     is therefore important to be cautious in applying          in two by function, though the distinction&#13;
     the prescriptions of one country to the transport          is perhaps not as great as it seems as&#13;
     market circumstances of another. Moreover, the             those organized by mode have functional&#13;
     enabling environments will differ depending on             departments within them, and those by&#13;
     historical, political, legal, and cultural factors.        function have some mode-specific units in their&#13;

     conditions clearly differ. This section tries to&#13;
     capture those general lessons provided by the           √¢&#128;¬¢	 Ministries of Transport determine national port&#13;
     case studies described above.                              development policy and strategic planning;&#13;

        government entities in transport differ because&#13;
        transport is often combined with other sectors       √¢&#128;¬¢	 Ports (or groups of ports) are usually publicly&#13;
        (examples include telecommunications, land,             owned and administered as √¢&#128;&#156;landlord√¢&#128;&#157; port&#13;

     √¢&#128;¬¢	 The transport divisions of each ministry&#13;
        nevertheless have many common elements and           √¢&#128;¬¢	 On balance there is a policy preference (not&#13;

√¢&#128;¬¢	 Ministries with oversight of the transport/           and vehicles, as well as by the increasing fuel&#13;
   public works sector determine national roads          efficiency of conventional vehicles. There is&#13;
   policy and strategic planning of networks, and        a growing recognition in the more advanced&#13;
   ownership of the roads is vested in the public        countries to shift from fuel taxation to road-&#13;
   sector;                                               usage-based taxation;&#13;

√¢&#128;¬¢	 The road network is typically classified by law    √¢&#128;¬¢	 All of the countries have utilized PPP&#13;

   √Ç¬ª	 Major trunk roads, including expressways        √¢&#128;¬¢	 South Korea and Finland are global leaders in the&#13;
      and toll roads, are normally managed at the        application of Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS)&#13;
      national level by a government department          to their high-performance expressways, while&#13;
      (as in Chile and Finland), and are often           other countries have introduced centralized&#13;

      state/provincial/local governments and             policies; (b) enacting legislation affecting public&#13;
      urban roads by city governments or urban           transport; and (c) vehicle licensing;&#13;

   increasing number are being structured along&#13;
   commercial lines with greater functional and       √¢&#128;¬¢	 With few exceptions, the assignment of roles&#13;
   financial autonomy;                                   and responsibilities for addressing public&#13;
                                                         transport is complicated with overlaps and gaps&#13;
√¢&#128;¬¢	 In bigger countries the road provision entities       in responsibility at different government levels;&#13;
   are decentralized with construction and&#13;
   maintenance implemented through regional           √¢&#128;¬¢	 Municipal governments or special metropolitan&#13;
   and local offices, sometimes with a high degree       transport authorities are typically responsible&#13;
   of autonomy;                                          for service planning, the contracting and&#13;

√¢&#128;¬¢	 There has been a significant downsizing of road       fares, and the provision of public transport&#13;
   departments with the number of staff declining        infrastructure within their jurisdictions;&#13;
   from tens of thousands of personnel to a few&#13;
   thousand (Chile and South Korea) and in some       √¢&#128;¬¢	 Private bus operators are the principal providers&#13;
   instances just a few hundred (South Africa            of public transport services in most of the urban&#13;
   and Finland). This has been achieved mainly           areas, though metropolitan authorities and&#13;
   by outsourcing maintenance works (and some            municipal government sometimes do provide&#13;
   client functions such as surveys and designs) to      services with their own bus companies;&#13;
   competitively selected private contractors;&#13;
                                                      √¢&#128;¬¢	 Inter-city bus services are mainly provided&#13;
√¢&#128;¬¢	 Three of the five countries use earmarked             by the private sector with either national or&#13;
   taxes to fund road expenditures, but only one         regional government entities authorizing the&#13;
   (Morocco) has a traditional Road Fund. Budget         service, and providing subsidies where needed.        47&#13;
&amp;#12;     In the transport sector as a whole the lessons&#13;
     of international experience in reorganizing sector&#13;
     governance are confirmed as they have been long&#13;
     understood, to paraphrase Amos (2006)33:&#13;
&#13;
     √¢&#128;¬¢	 Restructuring a complex industry or&#13;
        organization is a long-term process. It often&#13;
        requires legislative, as well as institutional and&#13;
        management changes, and a period of cultural&#13;
        adjustment within organizations before&#13;
        benefits emerge. Unrealistic timetables that&#13;
        do not allow for the time needed for political&#13;
        process, for the consensus building needed&#13;
        for radical change, and the need to overcome&#13;
        organizational inertia are likely to be frustrated.&#13;
&#13;
     √¢&#128;¬¢	 Structural change is only a means to an&#13;
        end. That end is to improve performance.&#13;
        Governments can create the policy platform&#13;
        and framework for this improved entity&#13;
        performance but only managements and&#13;
        their employees can deliver the goods. Close&#13;
        attention therefore needs to be given to&#13;
        investing in the actual process of business&#13;
        change management, attraction of the best&#13;
        skills and experience, worker consultation&#13;
        and participation, creation of the appropriate&#13;
        culture, incentive structures, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
     √¢&#128;¬¢	 Even within a particular sector of transport,&#13;
        such as a highways agency, or rail or port&#13;
        company, one structural model does not fit&#13;
        all. The international experience needs to be&#13;
        mined, but then shaped to local markets and&#13;
        circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
     √¢&#128;¬¢	 Public enterprise reform is not a √¢&#128;&#156;fire and&#13;
        forget√¢&#128;&#157; process. Good public custodianship&#13;
        requires explicit supervisory and monitoring&#13;
        mechanisms. When government enterprises are&#13;
        not working well it is often the processes of&#13;
        public governance that need scrutiny as much&#13;
        as the enterprises themselves.&#13;
&#13;
     √¢&#128;¬¢	 Transport markets and technologies are&#13;
        continually changing. New transport demands&#13;
        and opportunities will emerge with economic&#13;
        development and technological progress. The&#13;
        objective of transport policy should not be to&#13;
        achieve a given end state, but to create an&#13;
        industry adaptable and responsive to change.&#13;

            aimed to identify more efficient institutional and
            governance structures to manage the transport sector in
            Oman. It encompassed on road transport, maritime transport,
            railways, and road-based public transport. Aviation and
            airports were excluded from the scope of the study. The
            study consisted of an institutional review of transport
            sector organization in select countries. The case study
            countries were selected for a combination of attributes:
            well-managed systems known to be effective and with elements
            recognized internationally as good practice. The case
            studies map the institutional structures of their transport
            sector ministries and of individual transport sector modes
            (or sub-sectors). The countries represent a diverse group by
            geography and demographics. In addition, this paper
            describes how transport sub-sectors are organized in the
            five case study countries dealing respectively with: (1) the
            peak governance entity, typically a Ministry of Transport or
            equivalent, and the central functions of regulatory
            administration; (2) ports; (3) railways; (4) roads, (5) and
            public transport. Particular attention is given to
            structural, institutional, and financing dimensions. This
            report may be of interest to transport sector political
            leaders, public officials, and their advisers who may be
            contemplating the assessment or strengthening of transport
            sector governance in their own countries.
