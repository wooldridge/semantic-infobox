FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
PRIVATE FARMER SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:              The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
Executing Agency:      Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy&#13;
Beneficiaries:         Private farmers&#13;
Amount:                SDR: 5.4 million (US$7.9 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                 Standard IDA terms: Thirty-five years, including ten years of grace&#13;
Objectives:            The project is designed to support the economic transformation process by&#13;
strengthening agricultural support services to private farmers in order to&#13;
increase their productivity and income.&#13;
Description:           The project would fund technical specialists, training and equipment that&#13;
would be used to: (i) develop participatory and accountable extension services&#13;
through cost-sharing with farmer organizations and reorientation of&#13;
government extension; (ii) carry out on-farm adaptive research; (iii) privatize&#13;
the veterinary service and enhance government's epidemiology and border&#13;
quarantine capabilities; and (iv) establish a market news service and design&#13;
a horticulture wholesale market system. The project will also support the&#13;
institutional development of financial institutions involved in rural finance,&#13;
including of Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) under the Private Sector&#13;
Development Project (PSDP).&#13;
Benefits:              Private farmers will be the principal beneficiaries, deriving benefits from&#13;
improved support services. Agricultural research and extension is expected&#13;
to lead to reduced production costs and increased farm incomes. For example,&#13;
adapting known technology to Macedonian conditions can reasonably be&#13;
expected to enable a 15% to 30% reduction in herbicide usage worth as much&#13;
as US$1 million per year. Farm models suggest that more effective advice on&#13;
production technology, market information, animal health services and credit&#13;
can boost small, private farmers incomes by 10 to over 50 percent. Better&#13;
enzootic disease control and livestock product sanitary inspection will enhance&#13;
consumer safety as well help insure continued access to European Union&#13;
markets. Pilot Initiatives to shift some of the costs of Government services,&#13;
for example, advisory services to the beneficiaries will establish a basis on&#13;
which to reduce public expenditures in the range of US$0.7 to 1.4 million per&#13;
year. Project benefits will be supported and enhanced by the PSDP project&#13;
that is being processed in parallel and which will facilitate farmers' access to&#13;
credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
Risks:                 The principal risks are economic and geo-political. Economic risks stem from&#13;
the possibility of macroeconomic destabilization and delays in structural&#13;
reforms.  However, the Government continues to adhere to its reform&#13;
program and contemplates new reform measures including the privatization of&#13;
agri-kombinats and further reforms of agricultural price and trade policy. The&#13;
reopening of the country's southern border, and more recently the ending of&#13;
the Serbian embargo, should help in stimulating trade and private sector&#13;
development. The reforms supported by the FESAC, together with on-going&#13;
dialogue with the IMF (to extend the Stand-by Arrangement) and the Bank&#13;
Group on a proposed SAL should minimize the risk of policy slippage. Geo-&#13;
political risks stemming from regional conflicts and ethnic strife in the Balkan&#13;
region remain an overhanging risk for any operation of this kind.&#13;
Project specific risks relate mainly to potential resistance at the operational&#13;
level by various public institutions and services involved in the project to give&#13;
up traditional influence and responsibilities. This would be mitigated by an&#13;
intensive retraining program and seminars explaining the rationale for the&#13;
changes introduced under the project. These are being addressed through&#13;
technical specialists already provided by a PPF for start-up activities, and by&#13;
early project implementation features. Finally, cost-sharing arrangements in&#13;
the provision of advisory services to farmers may encounter poor receptivity&#13;
due to past experience with Government. This risk will be mitigated by&#13;
developing strong incentives for community participation. The proposed mid-&#13;
term review will provide an opportunity to review and change project design&#13;
if required.&#13;

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
PRIVATE FARMER SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01   The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a landlocked country on the Balkan Peninsula&#13;
with a population of about 2 million people and an area of 25,700 km2. With 45% of the population&#13;
rurally based, agrarian linkages are strong and help shape the national character. Agricultural production&#13;
accounts for about 15% of employment. Though constrained by normal variations in weather, marketing&#13;
problems, and the difficult political environment, agriculture has an important place in the national&#13;
economy and was the only sector to grow in 1994.&#13;
1.02   The proposed Private Farmer Support Project (PFSP) was identified in September 1993&#13;
following a February 1993 joint agriculture review mission of IDA and the FAO Investment Center. In&#13;
February and May 1994, FAO Investment Center assisted the Government with project preparation.&#13;
Following an IDA mission in July 1994, project preparation continued through a Project Preparation&#13;
Facility (PPF). Following appraisal in April 1995, a Deutsche Marks (DM) 4 million farm credit&#13;
component was included in the Private Sector Development Project (DM 18 million general line of&#13;
credit, which is being processed in parallel). The PSDP would be an important source of investment&#13;
credit for private farmers interested in expanding operations and improving their productivity.&#13;
II. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. The Economy in Transformation&#13;
2.01   Macroeconomic  Adjustment. The  Government has made  encouraging  progress  in&#13;
macroeconomic adjustment and structural reforms. In 1994, the Government implemented a set of&#13;
comprehensive reform measures including strict budgetary discipline and monetary reforms which brought&#13;
greater price stability. Significant progress has been made in normalizing the external debt situation,&#13;
enacting basic laws to restructure and privatize the inefficient, socially-owned enterprise and financial&#13;
sectors, and in reforming the social safety net. Most foreign trade barriers have been removed. Tariffs&#13;
are low, averaging 10% with a large number of zero-rated items. Restrictions that remain apply mainly&#13;
to metal and a limited number of agricultural products. A source of price distortion in agriculture are&#13;
variable levies mainly for wheat, milk and sugar. Economic reforms planned for 1996 seek to accelerate&#13;
the process of financial stabilization and to enhance structural reforms in the enterprise, banking, and&#13;
social sectors. The Bank Group intends to support further deepening of the reform process through a&#13;
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) currently under preparation which would address the distortions in the&#13;
agricultural sector.&#13;
2.02   Macroeconomic Trends. The decline in overall output since 1990 has yet to be reversed,&#13;
although the agricultural sector showed nearly 8% growth in 1994. Registered unemployment has&#13;
increased to about 20%. On the other hand, inflation, at a monthly peak of 80% in early 1992, declined&#13;
during implementation of the second stabilization program to 2% a month by March 1994. For 1995,&#13;
the annual rate of inflation is estimated at about 8%. Fiscal management, however, has been a problem.&#13;
Growing government expenditures increased fiscal deficits from 3.4% of Gross Social Product (GSP) in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
1991 to 11.1 % in 1993. Improved government efforts to raise revenues have resulted in a decline of the&#13;
fiscal deficit to about 2.4% in 1994. Traditional export markets in the former Yugoslavia and the&#13;
Council of Mutual Economic Assistance were lost, and trade further suffered because of the Greek&#13;
blockade. Nevertheless, overall exports to non-traditional markets have increased and appear to have&#13;
compensated for the loss of traditional markets. The composition of exports has also changed and is&#13;
characterized by a decline in manufactured exports while agricultural exports have risen in relative&#13;
importance. The prospects for peace in the Region and the lifting of the Greek blockade have&#13;
significantly improved the prospects of economic recovery, in which the agricultural sector will play a&#13;
vital role.&#13;
B. The Agricultural Sector&#13;
2.03   The Resource Base. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia covers 2.57 million ha, of&#13;
which about 50% is agricultural land including 662,000 ha of arable land and 640,000 ha of permanent&#13;
pasture (principally in mountainous areas); forests cover a further 950,000 ha. The irrigation command&#13;
area is 120,000 ha. Irrigated farming presently is restricted to about 50,000 ha because of insufficient&#13;
water and breakdown of irrigation infrastructure. Although only modestly endowed with natural&#13;
resources, the country has areas conducive to the production of a wide variety of crops, including cereals,&#13;
forages, industrial crops and off-season fruit and vegetables. The extensive pasture resources support&#13;
traditional sheep farming, a basis for a profitable lamb export business.&#13;
2.04   The Importance of Agriculture. In contrast to other sectors, agriculture production has always&#13;
been predominantly a private sector activity in the country. The sector's contribution to GSP possibly&#13;
understates its importance to the economy, in that 45% of the population lives in rural areas, and their&#13;
welfare and incomes are closely linked to agriculture. Farming is expected to assume an increasingly&#13;
important role in the medium-term as labor is shed from the industrial sector. In 1994, GSP per worker&#13;
in agriculture was estimated at 127% of the country's average in all sectors of the economy.&#13;
2.05   The majority of urban population retains close family links with the agricultural sector. Most&#13;
farm families live in close-knit village communities. Women play an important role in agricultural&#13;
management and production on private farms as members and administrators of agri-kombinats (AKs)&#13;
as well as in governmental services (e.g., extension or veterinary). Education levels of farm families are&#13;
lower than those of urban counterparts. While there are wide variations, farm families are commonly&#13;
seen as risk-averse and conservative. On the other hand, small private farmers have been most agile in&#13;
responding to the changing market circumstances associated with the transformation process. Most farm&#13;
families have assured food supplies and substantial homes (albeit, sometimes, without running water in&#13;
the more remote areas), and are reasonably well mechanized, averaging one tractor per 9.7 ha. Ninety-&#13;
three percent of the country's estimated 51,000 tractors are owned by private farmers.&#13;
2.06   Agricultural trade constituted about 16% of export earnings -- about US$172 million in 1994,&#13;
a sharp decline from 1992 and 1993 levels, when agriculture exports were US$323 million and US$389&#13;
million respectively. Food and live animals exports were US$110 million - about 10% of all exports&#13;
compared to US$184 million in 1992. Major exports in 1994 were fruit and vegetables (US$70 million),&#13;
wine (US$15 million), and meat (US$8 million). However, current trade data should be taken with&#13;
caution. In the past, the country was an important supplier of fruit and vegetables, and lamb and (to a&#13;
lesser extent) beef to Greece, Italy, and the other Republics of Yugoslavia. The decline in exports is&#13;
primarily related to the Greek blockade and UN sanctions on Serbia, but also to the transformation&#13;
process in which hard budget constraints on agri-kombinats disrupted the old marketing channels. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
restructuring of the country's financial system, the lack of export financing, and problems securing&#13;
working capital (a particular problem for agriculture given the seasonality of the agricultural production&#13;
cycle) also present formidable barriers for exporters. The greatest losses in exports have occurred in live&#13;
animal and meat exports. High-value vegetable and fruit producers also face an increasingly competitive&#13;
market because of higher marketing (transportation) costs and, more recently, appreciation of the Denar.&#13;
2.07   The Private Farming Sector in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is made up of small&#13;
farms. About 70% of arable land, approximately 458,000 ha, belongs to private farmers, consisting of&#13;
some 177,000 families owning an average 2.6 ha of land. All agricultural land is fragmented, although&#13;
the actual extent of this is not known precisely. Private farms are often highly diversified and grow a&#13;
comparatively large number of crops. This is partly due to traditions by which families ensure self-&#13;
sufficiency, spread labor requirements, and avert risk. There are notable variations in this pattern, for&#13;
example, where farmers specialize in vegetables and/or fruit production and, occasionally, in livestock&#13;
fattening and dairying.&#13;
2.08   Farms are operated almost exclusively by labor of the extended family, although casual labor may&#13;
be employed during peak demand periods (particularly with vegetable production). Where male family&#13;
members are employed by the neighboring agri-kombinat or at a local industry, women are often the&#13;
primary managers of the family's home-based livestock and vegetable/fruit production units. While the&#13;
farming systems are, for the most part, relatively labor intensive, the early to mid-1980s were a period&#13;
of over-mechanization for many private farms -- the result of an extended period of subsidized credit,&#13;
subsidized farm machinery, and the promotion of mechanization as a "modern" farming practice.&#13;
2.09   Farm family incomes, for which little data is available, are derived from both cash and non-cash&#13;
as well as from farm and non-farm sources. Cash income arises from three main sources -- the sale of&#13;
farm products, cash remittances, and other off-farm earnings. Off-farm social sector earnings have been&#13;
important income sources in the past, though they are now reduced substantially due to social sector&#13;
layoffs. Pensions, for which all Macedonians are eligible, represent a vital, and reportedly reasonably&#13;
good safety net for aged private farmers. Farmers report that annual pensions range from US$500 to&#13;
US$1,000 equivalent.&#13;
2.10   Agri-kombinats farm about 200,000 ha of farm land, and account for about 25% of primary&#13;
production and for 60% of processing and marketing services. There are 217 agri-kombinats with an&#13;
average land holding size of 950 ha. The range extends from small intensive enterprises to extensive&#13;
farms -- the largest, the Pelagonija Kombinat at Bitola--covers 25,000 ha. AKs are typically organized&#13;
into vertically-integrated production and agro-processing complexes engaged in a wide range of activities&#13;
including input supply, farming, out-grower production contracts, primary production processing, and&#13;
commodity retailing and trading. While they continue to exert strong influence in the agricultural sector,&#13;
their long-term economic survival is in doubt. This has been confirmed by detailed analysis of three of&#13;
the largest AKs during preparation of the Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (FESAC)&#13;
which revealed major technical and financial problems. Under the Special Restructuring Program of the&#13;
FESAC, three of the largest AKs were put into receivership and would be broken up and privatized. The&#13;
proposed SAL would support the continuation of privatization of the agri-kombinats.&#13;
2.11   The input supply system is being augmented by private trading companies moving into the input&#13;
supply market which government policy encourages. As the importance of AKs declined, and given the&#13;
relative ease of entry for new business, small private businesses have developed and become important&#13;
in the new upstream and downstream agricultural service sectors. Indeed, competition is appearing in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the supply of services to the private farm sector which was not the case before independence. The demise&#13;
of AKs is not expected to constrain growth by private farmers. International agro-businesses are largely&#13;
absent from the market. In this area the process of transformation is being retarded by the lack of&#13;
private-sector investment (in part due to the unavailability of credit for working capital and investment),&#13;
and the general uncertainties associated with the Region. New investment is needed in private agro-&#13;
business supplying tractors and equipment, seed and fertilizer, and custom services for specialized&#13;
equipment.&#13;
2.12   Although decreasing, agricultural marketing continues to be dominated by the agri-kombinats.&#13;
Overall this inhibits competition and limits alternatives available to farmers. This situation is likely to&#13;
persist until completion of the privatization of AKs. No commodity exchange exists, nor is this likely&#13;
to be viable until commodity grading improves and production and organization uncertainties are reduced.&#13;
Farmers' market access is provided through informal local green markets and sale to social sector&#13;
enterprises -- usually under forward contract and, on a limited but rapidly increasing scale, to private&#13;
traders. For high-value products for exports, such as off-season vegetables and fruit, there is an&#13;
immediate need to develop a wholesale system to replace the agri-kombinats and provide a wholesale&#13;
service to the many small vegetable producers and new, private traders.&#13;
2.13   There is no formal market research or information service, an activity which in the past had&#13;
been provided by federal services of the former Yugoslavia. Near-real-time market information is needed&#13;
on prices, volumes, and qualities of product moving through domestic and international markets.&#13;
Informed analyses of market trends, opportunities, and outlooks are not readily available. Informal,&#13;
casual sources that are currently available usually lack perspective and breadth and are hardly sufficient&#13;
to form cropping pattern or investment choices.&#13;
2.14 Agricultural subsidies have declined from 23 % of agricultural GSP in 1993 to an estimated 6%,&#13;
or about US$50 million, in 1995. However, they still represent almost 90% of Government's agricultural&#13;
budget and primarily benefit agri-kombinats. About US$24 million is for price subsidies, US$7 million&#13;
for seed subsidies, and US$19 million for credit subsidies (mainly for storage). In 1994, wheat accounted&#13;
for 53% of the total subsidies, tobacco for 22%, and milk for 1 1%. While low by Western European&#13;
standards, subsidies represent an inefficient use of resources with little economic or equity rationale.&#13;
Government intends to continue phasing out subsidies, one of the policy issues to be addressed under the&#13;
proposed SAL.&#13;
2.15   The Government attempts to manage agricultural foreign trade by tariffs, special import levies&#13;
and quotas on imports and exports. Tariffs are generally low and most quotas do not have substantial&#13;
effect. The most distortive instrument are special levies on the imports of wheat, milk and sugar. Recent&#13;
analysis supported by USAID indicates high nominal protection coefficients for wheat - 2.18, raw sugar -&#13;
1.66, refined sugar - 1.37 and cow milk - 1.77, primarily because of the special levies. Changes in these&#13;
policies are important for overall efficiency reasons and for access to the World Trade Organization. The&#13;
proposed SAL would also address this issue.&#13;
C. The Institutional Framework&#13;
2.16   The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy employing about 420 staff with&#13;
fewer than 20% headquarters-based, is the central organization with administrative responsibility for&#13;
agricu!ture, rural development, natural resource management (forestry and fisheries), and the protection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of flora and fauna. Formally, MAFWE consists of three Departments 'Agriculture, Forestry, and&#13;
Administration and Legal Affairs' and three Republic Agencies 'Water Economy, Veterinary, and&#13;
Agriculture and Forestry Inspectorate (Annex 1).' Since national independence, and due to the change&#13;
in financing arrangements, the Macedonian Extension Service (MES) is also part of MAFWE. There is&#13;
little difference between Departments and Republic Agencies. The latter have as their prime roles&#13;
regulatory and inspection functions. Inspectorate staff are posted to MAFWE branch offices covering&#13;
one or more opstinas (municipality) while the small professional staff at the head office is concerned with&#13;
policy, legislation, and quality control.&#13;
2.17   Agricultural Research comprises six research institutes varying in size from a staff of 18&#13;
(Kocani) to 144 (Skopje), and the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Cyril and Methodius, Skopje.&#13;
The research establishment employs 540 staff including 216 professionals, 72% with postgraduate&#13;
degrees. Overall, the system represents institutional resources left in place following the breakup of the&#13;
former Yugoslavia and is larger than the country can sustain and afford. Over the medium-term, a&#13;
"strategic plan" is needed for restructuring the research establishment.&#13;
2.18   The Ministry or Science (MOS) is responsible for all research. Agricultural research funding&#13;
is often allocated to tasks having scientific merit but little relevance to problems and constraints at the&#13;
farm level. MAFWE does not participate in agricultural research planning or funding. Some applied&#13;
research funded by AKs has nearly ceased. MOS-supported research was primarily for short-term&#13;
(usually three-year) projects. MOS also funded some staff at key institutes. Today the bulk of funds&#13;
needed to maintain research staff and stations is generated by production activities at the institutes. The&#13;
system is not equipped to meet the needs of private farmers in the changing economic environment.&#13;
Particularty important is applied research to address the issues concerning soil fertility, e.g., developing&#13;
economic response curves for various levels of fertilizer use, pasture/meadow management, integrated&#13;
pest management ([PM), conservation tillage, farm management economics of the major cropping&#13;
patterns, and the introduction of horticultural varieties with good export potential.&#13;
2.19   The Macedonian Extension Service (MES) was first established in 1975 to promote private&#13;
agriculture, often in close association with agri-kombinat out-grower programs. MES now comprises&#13;
about 140 professionals in some 30 opstina extension centers. Under the former Yugoslav Republic,&#13;
MES centers were autonomous, self-managed entities in which the local government shared half the cost&#13;
with the Republic's Government. Since national independence, MES is funded from the national budget.&#13;
Most extension staff are technically well qualified. Because of the past practice of associating extension&#13;
initiatives with various forms of subsidies, e.g., free or highly-subsidized breeding stock, and given the&#13;
current tight budget situation, MES today reaches a comparatively small number of farmers. Another&#13;
legacy of the previous system is the heavy production and commodity orientation of the old MES.&#13;
Consequently, while staff may have an adequate level of technical proficiency, there is little expertise in&#13;
farm management and participatory methods of working with farmers. Staff also have limited transport,&#13;
equipment, and operating funds.&#13;
2.20   The main constraints, recognized by MAFWE, in the current extension system include: (i) the&#13;
lack of client accountability; (ii) the lack of effective applied research; (iii) inadequate attention to&#13;
production economics and farm management; (iv) insufficient knowledge of farmers' resources and&#13;
difficulties; and (v) inadequate operational budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2.21   The Macedonian Veterinary Management Unit of the MAFWE employs 78 veterinarians for&#13;
control of notifiable disease, sanitation, animal quarantine, and epidemiological work. Field veterinary&#13;
services are provided principally through a network of 27 socially-owned, veterinary stations (clinics or&#13;
surgeries) established in most opstinas. Stations employ between one and eight veterinarians depending&#13;
on opstina size and animal population. Veterinary stations generally are well organized and staffed. They&#13;
are supported with some income derived from drug sales and contracted government services and are&#13;
supervised by the Macedonian Veterinary Management Unit in the MAFWE. The legislative base for their&#13;
privatization is anticipated in 1996. All vaccines and most drugs are imported. Laboratory services are&#13;
provided by the Veterinary Institute in Skopje which, through user charges, is largely self-financing.&#13;
Overall, the Veterinary Institute offers a comprehensive service to the livestock and livestock product&#13;
processing industries.&#13;
2.22   Farmers' Organizations. Since 1990, some 300 agricultural associations have been formed,&#13;
although many are inoperative and the status of others is unclear. While these organizations were&#13;
established under the cooperative law, this law is not consistent with cooperative membership, based on&#13;
shared unity of interest. Although deemed to be private sector enterprises, their legal status is unclear,&#13;
and, on the surface, they seem to be made up of kombinat members -- with their leadership drawn from&#13;
the old management. MAFWE is planning legal changes to clarify, and provide for, regulation of&#13;
associations. There is a network of 19 commodity-based Sections within the Association of Agriculture&#13;
and Food Industries of the Chamber of Commerce. Agricultural Sections, which are based regionally&#13;
and include both farmer and agri-kombinat representation, focused on the major agricultural products of&#13;
their regions, Kombinat membership has been compulsory, with the kombinats providing the financing.&#13;
There is no registration of farmer "members," nor are they assessed dues. Consequently, private farmers&#13;
have had little influence on the AAFI. With the transformation process and the privatization of the agri-&#13;
kombinats continuing, the role of the AAFI is likely to fade.&#13;
2.23   Several technical assistance programs have been completed or are underway to support reform&#13;
in agriculture. The German Government supports the irrigation sub-sector and is preparing a credit&#13;
program directed for the re-settlement of German-based refugees. The Netherlands Government is&#13;
expected to provide bilateral assistance to agriculture. The International Fund for Agricultural&#13;
Development (IFAD) is preparing a regional development project that focuses on remote, resource poor&#13;
areas. The Macedonian Center for International Cooperation, an NGO apex organization, is assisting&#13;
villages in remote locations with infrastructure development and communications packages on a cost-&#13;
sharing basis with support form the Dutch Reform Church.&#13;
2.24   USAID has by far the largest program -- about $10 million in grant funds and bilateral programs&#13;
-- directly related to the proposed project. Close cooperation has developed during project preparation&#13;
among IDA, USAID staff and local counterparts. USAID program includes: (i) the establishment of&#13;
a Business Resource Center to assist entrepreneurs to put together business plans, develop privatization&#13;
plans and prepare loan applications; (ii) analysis of agricultural price and trade policies; (iii) a number&#13;
of veterinarian volunteers through Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance specifically aimed to&#13;
help privatize veterinarian services; (iv) dairy improvement project to help private dairy farmers increase&#13;
the production and improve milk quality; (vi) a study of land ownership issues to identify policy options&#13;
available to Government, particularly with respect to denationalization of land; (vii) finalization and&#13;
analysis of the 1994 census concerning agriculture; and (viii) a pilot supporting establishment of 20 rural,&#13;
member-owned, Savings Associations (SAs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. Agriculture and the Environment&#13;
2.25   Environmental regulation is the responsibility of the Ministry of Urbanism, Construction and&#13;
Environmental Protection, as lead Ministry together with MAFWE, the Ministry of Health, and the&#13;
Institute of Natural Rarities.  Laws governing environmental management include the Law on&#13;
Environment, the Water Law, and the Law for the Protection and Use of Agricultural Land.&#13;
Environmental issues relating to agriculture primarily include aspects of water quality and use, land&#13;
degradation, agro-chemical use, and agri-kombinat waste discharge.  These issues have economic&#13;
relevance as they may affect access to Western markets (particularly for environmentally-clean products).&#13;
Legislation, now in draft form, also would address a wider range of environmental issues and better&#13;
empower Government to regulate the environment. Land degradation could remain an issue as farmers,&#13;
under current economic policies, seek to increase profitable small ruminant production in upland areas.&#13;
However, the policy reforms proposed under the SAL would reduce the current attractiveness of small&#13;
ruminants in the less productive, more fragile upland areas. Pending development of a national water&#13;
development policy, water management would remain an area of concern. With IDA assistance, a&#13;
National Environmental Action Plan is currently under preparation and is expected to be finished in the&#13;
Spring of 1996.&#13;
E. Rural Financial Services&#13;
2.26   Village-based savings societies date back to the last century. Money lenders and other informal&#13;
systems of mobilizing savings and extending credit also existed. These systems disappeared during the&#13;
four decades of state monopoly on banking. With respect to the formal banking sector, the Stopanska&#13;
Bank, the bank responsible for all agricultural lending in the past, is currently undergoing restructuring&#13;
and privatization. While there are substantial savings in rural and farm communities, savers have&#13;
developed distrust of the formal banking system, and, formal financial service for small farmers, rural&#13;
residents, and holders of remittances have yet to emerge.&#13;
2.27   Private farmers have difficulty in accessing the formal, commercial banking system to obtain&#13;
credit: Loans are typically small and the risks associated with farming are perceived to be high.&#13;
Compounding the problem are court practices, as well as the underlying legal framework, that are biased&#13;
against lenders, particularly when on occasion collateral has to be enforced. Chattel mortgages and&#13;
production inputs are not used. Furthermore the newly privatized commercial banks need to develop their&#13;
overall asset/liabilities management, risk management and appraisal capabilities, and have few branches&#13;
in rural areas. Effective demand for credit from private farmers during transition is expected to be&#13;
modest. This is because small private farmers are wary of debt, particularly when banks commonly ask&#13;
for two to three times the value of a loan to be backed by land as collateral. Moreover, effective real&#13;
rates of interest remain high. Most private farmers rely on self-financing. It is expected that these&#13;
conditions would improve as the ongoing stabilization program progresses.&#13;
F. World Bank Group Strategy and Rationale for Involvement&#13;
2.28   The Government is committed to completing the process of transition to a market economy. The&#13;
reform agenda is comprehensive and includes: (i) macroeconomic policies to stabilize the economy; (ii)&#13;
enhancing private sector development through privatization and complementary measures to improve the&#13;
business environment by reducing the role of the state; (iii) reforming the banking sector; (iv) building&#13;
on private sector capabilities to increase agricultural production; (v) modernizing the country's physical&#13;
infrastructure; (vi) developing an effective social safety net; (vii) improving public administration; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(viii) improving environmental management. In agriculture, the Government has substantially reduced&#13;
subsidies and introduced legislation to Parliament to denationalize land and privatize the agri-kombinats.&#13;
2.29   The Government strategy has been supported by the Bank Group through policy dialogue and&#13;
lending program. The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy, (Report No. 14379-MK, dated April&#13;
19, 1995), which was presented to the Board on May 16, 1995, aims to: (i) facilitate and support the&#13;
structural reform and the transformation to a market economy; (ii) contribute to financing balance-of-&#13;
payments requirements; (iii) support structural adjustment and development efforts; and (iv) help to&#13;
mobilize resources from both official and private sources. The proposed project was identified in the&#13;
CAS and fully supports the Bank Group's overall strategy for the country, which recognizes that&#13;
agriculture has significant growth potential and that strengthening private sector capability is key to&#13;
realizing that potential.&#13;
2.30   The initial support to the Government's reform program was provided through the Economic&#13;
Recovery Project of US$80 million, which has by now been fully implemented. The centerpiece of the&#13;
Bank Group's current operations is the Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (FY95), which&#13;
supports the following measures: (i) comprehensive reform of the banking sector and financial markets;&#13;
(ii) isolation of largest loss-making enterprises from bank credit and leading to liquidation or privatization&#13;
of major loss makers; (iii) comprehensive privatization program; (iv) special restructuring program for&#13;
social safety net program. Three of the 25 large loss-making enterprises targeted are in the agricultural&#13;
sector.&#13;
2.31   The Bank Group's strategy for the agriculture sector also reflects the country specific&#13;
experience gained since the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia joined the Bank Group. As the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy points out, the Bank Group's overall strategy in agriculture would promote&#13;
the reduction of subsidies, privatization of the agri-kombinats, shifting more responsibility for support&#13;
services to the private sector, and supporting the transformation to a market-lead economy. Under the&#13;
proposed SAL. The Government has confirmed its agreement in principle to proceed with reforms&#13;
specifically with respect to liberalizing the trade regime, reforming agricultural price policy and&#13;
privatizing the agri-kombinats. The Bank Group is also preparing an irrigation project and an agricultural&#13;
inputs guarantee operation is under consideration.&#13;
2.32   As noted above, the proposed project is fully consistent with the Bank Group's Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy. The project is being processed in parallel with the proposed PSDP which aims to&#13;
promote growth of the private sector enterprise; facilitate transformation of the credit markets and&#13;
introduction of sound banking practices. The PSDP includes DM 4 million to provide loans to private&#13;
farmers. Specific measures would be taken to expand the outreach of the participating banks to include&#13;
the rural areas. These efforts would be coordinated with an expected USAID pilot project to develop&#13;
rural-based, member-owned SAs expected to be completed by early 1998.&#13;
2.33   Lessons learned from the Bank Group's earlier projects in the former Yugoslavia and from other&#13;
similar projects in the region include: (i) Macedonian private farmers have demonstrated their willingness&#13;
and ability to adopt new technology and farming systems, provided these are economically viable; (ii)&#13;
private farmers prefer private to social sector marketing channels; (iii) issues of a sound policy framework&#13;
for agricultural investment and limited project implementation capacity were not satisfactorily addressed&#13;
and this limited the benefits obtained from the projects; and (iv) experience with rural credit projects in&#13;
transitional economies has demonstrated that the formal banking system has difficulty in appraisal and&#13;
supervision of agricultural loans, in part because of the "cultural" bias within banks against agriculture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
and unique aspects of agriculture such as seasonality and weather vulnerability. These lessons have been&#13;
factored into the design of the Bank Group's strategy for the sector and of the proposed project.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives and Concept&#13;
3.01   Project Objective. The proposed project would support the economic transformation process&#13;
by strengthening the provision of technology and information related services to private farmers, thereby&#13;
improving their production and income. The project would change mechanisms for provision of technical&#13;
services to private farmers and initiate important changes in the public institutions providing such&#13;
services.&#13;
3.02   Project Justification. Sustained growth in agriculture is feasible and crucial to overall economic&#13;
growth. Traditional Macedonian export products such as fruit, vegetables and lamb present viable source&#13;
of income for private farmers. The proposed project would improve their access to extension services,&#13;
relevant research, credit and animal health. It would support a reduced and better focused public sector&#13;
role in agriculture through assistance to the privatization of veterinary services and cost sharing with&#13;
farmers for their advisory services. It would support exports through market information services and&#13;
improved animal health control. While growth would be private sector led, the public sector would&#13;
continue to play a role, albeit redefined, in the provision of agricultural research, advisory services and&#13;
market information. The project seeks to rationalize and enhance these functions.&#13;
3.03   Design considerations. Sustainability of agricultural support services was a major concern in&#13;
preparing this project. Budgetary resources for public sector expenditures are scarce and this is not&#13;
expected to change in the near future. The project would support the privatization of the veterinary&#13;
services and cost-sharing arrangements with farmers for advisory services. The market news services,&#13;
after establishing credibility and reliability, would be sold to media organizations for commercial&#13;
publication, thus offsetting the costs of the service to Government. In the longer term, this service is&#13;
expected to be privatized. As a result, the project is expected to reduce public expenditures in the&#13;
agricultural sector. The project would also help strengthen the accountability and responsiveness of&#13;
agricultural support services to farmers. Privatizing veterinary services and shifting some responsibility&#13;
for provision of advisory services to farmers gives farmers ownership and enhances the accountability&#13;
between them and agricultural advisors. The project was designed with strong participation by the&#13;
principal beneficiaries, specifically private farmers, veterinarians and extension agents.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.04   The project would be implemented over three and a half years (CY96-99). Project funds would&#13;
be used for technical specialists, training, equipment, vehicles, and small support grants. The project&#13;
would include the following main components:&#13;
(a)    pilot initiatives to develop cost-sharing arrangements with farmer associations, to&#13;
decentralize extension management and responsibility for support to farmers, and to&#13;
strengthen MES's extension capacity;&#13;
(b)    support for applied agricultural research through competitively-awarded contracts;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(c)    support for privatization of veterinary services and development of public epidemiological&#13;
and quarantine services;&#13;
(d)    development of a market news/information service and planning work for a private&#13;
horticulture wholesale market;&#13;
(e)    assistance to improve farmers' access to commercial credit and to evaluate the feasibility&#13;
of an apex organization for rural, member-owned SAs; and&#13;
(f)    assistance to selected commercial banks to improve their capacity to facilitate expansion&#13;
of financial services.&#13;
Agricultural Support Services&#13;
3.05   Agricultural Advisory Services (US$3.32 million base costs). This component would help&#13;
identify solutions for more effective provision of advisory services and support pilot initiatives for&#13;
improvements in the provision of these services to private farmers. The MES, working with leaders of&#13;
farmer groups/associations, communities and/or NGOs would encourage these sort of groups to arrange&#13;
for the kind of advisory services they determine would best meet their needs, including the hiring of their&#13;
own advisors or contracting with a private firms to provide such services. This initiative does not intend&#13;
to replace the MES, but rather is an initial effort to pilot the shifting of some of the costs for advisory&#13;
services to the beneficiaries of these services. To do so the MES would establish an Agricultural Advisory&#13;
Services Fund (US$0.55 million) to use in entering into cost-sharing agreements with interested farmer&#13;
groups. The MES would agree with each group to cost-sharing on a declining scale from 75% in the&#13;
group's first year, 65% in its second and third year, 50% in its fourth year and thereafter at a mutually&#13;
agreed ratio, but not more than US$6,000 per year to any one group. The MES would also provide a&#13;
one-time, start-up matching grant for material deemed appropriate by each group such as office&#13;
equipment, etc., on the basis of 1/3 farmer group and 2/3 from the MES, not exceeding US$2,000 per&#13;
association. The cost-sharing support from the MES is anticipated to cover costs of advisors, handbooks,&#13;
special training programs, office equipment and/or other costs determined appropriate by each particular&#13;
group's assessment of their needs. Financing would expand from six pilot initiatives to about 40. More&#13;
details of cost-sharing are provided in Annex 5. At negotiations agreement was reached on the guidelines&#13;
for cost-sharing between MAFWE and farmer organizations. (para 6.01(a)).&#13;
3.06   Thirty MES opstina (municipality) extension centers country-wide would be strengthened through&#13;
training, demonstration materials, and the provision of office, audio-visual and electronic mail facilities.&#13;
The main long term objective is to assist MES in reorientation toward increased client accountability and&#13;
better support for development of farmer association advisory services. MES staff would be eligible for&#13;
vehicle loans and reimbursements for field use. Ninety person-months of reorientation training, and six&#13;
short courses overseas would be provided. Six of the opstinas would be strengthened by the assignment&#13;
of two additional MAFWE staff. The first would be an agronomist to serve as a research extension&#13;
coordinator to improve the linkage between MES, opstina staff and applied research activities. The&#13;
second would be an agricultural economist to analyze development constraints at the farm level, develop&#13;
representative farm models and appraise results of the applied research.&#13;
3.07   The project would also strengthen MES capacity for the provision of mass-media materials and&#13;
organization of national or regional training programs. Trainers, taught under the PPF with assistance&#13;
by an MES advisory services coordinator, would implement a program of reorientation courses for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
selected extension staff. Support would be provided for: (i) six-person months of international and 48-&#13;
person month of national specialist assistance; (ii) two short-course, fellowships abroad in extension&#13;
management; (iii) national technical seminars; (iv) office equipment, vehicles, and audio-visual&#13;
equipment; (v) commercial preparation of a series of mass-media extension packages; and (vi) funding&#13;
for extension impact studies to be conducted by a commercial firm.&#13;
3.08   Adaptive Agricultural Research (US$0.73 million base costs). This component would support&#13;
applied research by setting up a competitive research grant fund (US$0.5 million). Research grants/&#13;
contracts would be awarded for up to (US$25,000) directed to priority subjects such as integrated pest&#13;
management (IPM), animal husbandry, farm management, water use efficiency, conservation tillage,&#13;
pasture and range management and evaluation of new horticultural varieties. Other research ideas would&#13;
be identified in cooperation with farmers during project implementation.&#13;
3.09   Private Veterinary Services (US$0.47 million base costs). This component would support&#13;
measures to improve the provision of veterinary services. It would help fund a Veterinary Development&#13;
Fund (US$0.3 million) that would provide matching grants to state veterinary staff if they to switch to&#13;
private practice. It would also support the Veterinary Chamber, to be legislated under the new Veterinary&#13;
Law, through the provision of office facilities and technical specialist assistance with the preparation of&#13;
national veterinary protocols. It would also provide funding for training which local institutions, such&#13;
as the Faculty of Veterinary Science supported by limited international specialist assistance could provide.&#13;
3.10   Animal Health Services (US$1.10 million base costs). This component would strengthen&#13;
essential public animal health services of the MAFWE Veterinary Management Unit. This would include:&#13;
(i) recruitment of two additional staff and their specialized overseas training in disease epidemiology and&#13;
data management; (ii) specialist assistance (six person months) and national specialist assistance (48&#13;
person months) to support the development of public animal health program; (iii) provision of essential&#13;
office and transport equipment; (iv) animal health studies and strengthening of the Veterinary Institute's&#13;
analytical capability; (v) upgrading of Animal Quarantine Services at ten border posts through provision&#13;
of sampling equipment and vehicles; and (vi) funding of incremental operating costs.&#13;
3.11   Agricultural Market Information (US$0.71 million base costs). This component would support&#13;
the development of a market news service with 12-person months of international specialist assistance,&#13;
and 48 person months of national specialist assistance, office equipment, subscription services, and&#13;
training. It would support the planning and design of a private, wholesale horticulture market for Skopje.&#13;
Following market evaluation of its initial impact, SOM would review opportunities for selling near-real-&#13;
time market information to commodity traders and mass-media outlets. The SOM would also complete&#13;
the analysis of the 1994 census as it relates to agriculture. The analysis of the 1994 census would provide&#13;
benchmark information with respect to farmer income and productivity levels. The SOM would be&#13;
assisted by specialists to redefine its methodology for agricultural statistical data generation and provided&#13;
with the hardware and software for a computer-based compilation and analytical process.&#13;
3.12   Rural Financial Services (US$1.50 million base costs). This component would help improve&#13;
access of private farmers to commercial credit. It would engage six national specialists for two years to&#13;
assist private farmers with farm planning and preparation of loan applications that meet the standards of&#13;
private commercial banks. The specialists would be paid a small base salary and bonuses based on the&#13;
number of credit applications approved by banks. They would receive five person months of international&#13;
specialist assistance and training, which would also be available for credit officers of commercial banks.&#13;
International specialist assistance and training would also be available to assist commercial banks (US$0.3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
million) expected to participate under the PSDP (para 1.02) strengthen their portfolio management,&#13;
appraisal practices, management information systems, lending policies, risk management, loan&#13;
administration, supervision and in working with small and medium borrowers. International specialists&#13;
assistance would also be available to up-date the underlying legal framework concerning collateral and&#13;
court procedures. The project may also support expansion of the rural based SAs. However, the&#13;
appropriateness of this SA support would be determined latest by March 1998 by a joint Government and&#13;
IDA review of the pilot SA initiative. The project would also provide specialist assistance to draft&#13;
enabling legislation to facilitate the use of chattel mortgages and assist in updating court practices related&#13;
to lending. The credit would fund two person months and 16-person months of international and national&#13;
specialists respectively to assist the MAFWE on legal issues.&#13;
C. Project Costs&#13;
3.13   Total project costs including contingencies are estimated at US$10.2 million, of which US$5.5&#13;
million (52%) is in foreign exchange. Project base costs are expressed in October 1995 prices and&#13;
exclude customs duties (from which IDA financed goods purchased by MAFWE would be exempt) and&#13;
include taxes estimated at US$1.1 mi]lion, about 11 % of total project costs. Incremental recurrent costs&#13;
represent some 17% of estimated project costs. Due to the volatile rate of domestic inflation, both&#13;
domestic and foreign costs have been estimated in US dollars. The cost estimates include physical&#13;
contingencies of about 7% and price contingencies of about 7%. Price contingencies are based on IDA&#13;
projections of 1.52% for 1995, and 1.76% annually for 1996-99. Changes in Denar exchange rates are&#13;
expected to compensate for the differentials between domestic and international rate of inflation. Project&#13;
costs are detailed in Annex 2 and summarized in Table 3.1.&#13;
3.14   Financing Plan. The proposed IDA Credit of US$7.9 million equivalent would finance 77% of&#13;
the total project costs. The balance of US$2.3 million equivalent, including taxes and duties, would be&#13;
financed by the Government. No direct co-financing or parallel financing is expected, although USAID's&#13;
on-going program in agriculture is highly complementary to this project. Financing plan is summarized&#13;
in Table 3.2.&#13;
3.15   The Ministry of Finance would assure necessary counterpart funding. Adequate funds in&#13;
MAFWE's budget have been allocated for 1996. However, since shortage of counterpart funding always&#13;
poses a risk for project implementation, agreement has been reached at negotiations on a commitment to&#13;
exchange views with IDA by December 1 of each fiscal year on proposed future allocations so as to&#13;
ensure that subsequent government budget proposals will be consistent with the needs of the project (para&#13;
6.01 (b)).&#13;
3.16   Procurement Implementation. Procurement would be the responsibility of MAFWE which has&#13;
appointed a Project Manager to coordinate project implementation. MAFWE has already gained some&#13;
experience in project management and procurement under the PPF and would be properly staffed. The&#13;
General Procurement Notice has been issued in November 1995. A short term Procurement Advisor has&#13;
been engaged under a Trust Fund to assist the Project Manager in: (i) the preparation of bid packages&#13;
for the procurement of goods and consulting services prior to project Effectiveness; and (ii) providing&#13;
further training to the MAFWE staff. As part of the project launch workshop (September, 1996),&#13;
procurement issues would be particularly emphasized. During implementation, appropriate procurement&#13;
expertise would be engaged by the MAFWE as necessary. To the extent possible, contracts for goods&#13;
shall be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost US$250,000 or more for I.C.B. The proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3. 17 Procurement of Goods. Procurement of goods would be carried out following World Bank&#13;
Group Guidelines: "Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (Procurement Guidelines)," dated&#13;
January 1995, was confirmed at negotiations (para 6.01(c) as follows:&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Procurement of goods for contracts above&#13;
US$250,000 equivalent would be carried out following ICB procedures using standard&#13;
World Bank Group bidding documents.&#13;
(b)    Limited International Bidding (LIB). One package (US$0.43 million equivalent) for 4x4&#13;
vehicles and pickup trucks would be procured using LIB procedures involving bids&#13;
requests from major potential suppliers. Although above ICB threshold, use of LIB in&#13;
this case is expected to provide better competition and efficiency than a full scale ICB.&#13;
(c)   International Shopping (IS). Goods estimated to cost above US$30,000 and up to&#13;
US$250,000 equivalent per contract would be procured using IS procedures involving&#13;
quotations from at least three suppliers from two eligible countries. Eight packages&#13;
ranging from US$70,000 to US$220,000 (aggregate US$1.33 million) for vehicles,&#13;
computers and software, copiers and printers, and lab equipment would be procured.&#13;
(d)    National Shopping (NS). Goods estimated to cost up to US$30,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract would be procured using NS procedures based on comparison of price quotations&#13;
obtained from at least three local suppliers. The NS contracts are expected to range&#13;
between US$3,000 and US$30,000 (aggregate US$0.20 million) for small lots of&#13;
laboratory equipment, computers equipment, office furniture, extension training&#13;
equipment, and other office supplies. Given the presence of a number of foreign&#13;
suppliers with offices in the country, there is sufficient competition within the country&#13;
for the goods to be procured.&#13;
(e)    Direct Contracting (DC). Direct contracting would be restricted to items of proprietary&#13;
nature (aggregate US$0. 10 million) such as books and journals (US$30,000) and PABX&#13;
(US$60,000). The PABX needs to be compatible with equipment of the national phone&#13;
company and is a proprietary item manufactured only by the national telephone company.&#13;

3.18   Procurement of Consultant Services. Procurement of consultant services would follow the&#13;
Guidelines for Use of Consultants by Borrowers and by the IDA as Executing Agency (Guidelines for&#13;
the use of Consultants), dated August 1981 and would follow short listing procedures. Bank Group's&#13;
Standard "Form of Contract, Consultant's Services" would be used for all major consultant services&#13;
contracts. There would be one major international Technical Specialists contract (US$2.75 million).&#13;
Under this contract, the selected consulting firm would be expected to provide international (US$1.55&#13;
million) and national specialists (US$0.65 million) and would also include international training (US$0.25&#13;
million) and selected domestic training programs (US$0.30 million). As needed, the This selected&#13;
consulting firm would also provide procurement specialists with experience in IDA procurement&#13;
procedures. In addition, the firm would administer: (i) SA services (US$0.55 million) which would be&#13;
procured under a separate contract; and (ii) implement a number of specialized studies (US$0.35 million)&#13;
expected to cost between US$15,000 and US$25,000.&#13;
3.19   Adaptive Agricultural Research. Research contracts (aggregate US$0.60 million) would be&#13;
awarded to qualified eligible research organizations and/or individuals on a competitive basis and based&#13;
on ARC defined research guidelines acceptable to the IDA. The ARC would review research proposals&#13;
as to their adequacy in meeting the priority research objectives and ability of the responding&#13;
institution/individual to be able to carry out the proposed research adequately. A research contract would&#13;
generally not exceed US$25,000 equivalent.&#13;
3.20   Private Farmer Advisory Services and Private Veterinary Support. Two types of support&#13;
(aggregate US$0.60 million) would be available to farmer associations to support the privatization of&#13;
farmers services: (i) support from the MAFWE/MES for initial start-up costs on a matching 1/3 (farmer&#13;
association), 2/3 (MAFWE) basis not exceeding US$2,000 per association; and (ii) annual cost-sharing&#13;
on a declining basis from 75%, 65% and 50% for Years I and 2, 3 and 4, respectively, but not&#13;
exceeding US$6,000 per association per year. In addition, support to private veterinary stations&#13;
(US$0.35 million) for start up cost of private practice on a 60:40 private/MAFWE basis would be&#13;
provided. This grant element would not exceed US$15,000 per station and would be restricted to off-the-&#13;
shelf veterinary equipment.&#13;
3.21   Savings Associations. The project would provide support (US$0.50 million) for the development&#13;
of SAs. This would involve technical assistance and training services which would be procured following&#13;
the World Bank Group Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The specifics of the support for the&#13;
Savings Associations would be determined on the basis of a joint MAFWE, NBM and IDA review of the&#13;
pilot initiative experience the latest by March 1998.&#13;
3.22   Extension and Information Services. Beyond the consultant services (para 3.18), the project&#13;
would support technical services for 200 extension demonstrations (aggregate US$120,000) which would&#13;
be awarded on the basis of individual contracts with no one contract over US$500. Subscriptions to&#13;
market news services (aggregate US$40,000 million) would be done annually following the World Bank&#13;
Group Guidelines for National Shopping. Similarly, the production of information and/or training videos&#13;
(US$150,000 million) would be procured following National Shopping guidelines. The average&#13;
procurement is estimated at about US$10,000 per video.&#13;
3.23   Training, As mentioned earlier, international training (US$0.25 million) and a major part of the&#13;
domestic training (US$0.3 million) would be part of the management consulting firm's contract (para&#13;
3.19). The remaining training services would be contracted to qualified institutions on the basis of short&#13;
listing except for small amounts awarded to qualified individuals. They would cover training for opstina&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
level extension, for private and public veterinarians, and for extension re-training (US$0.11 million).&#13;
The largest training course (epidemiology) is estimated to cost US$35,000. All course contents and&#13;
training programs would be subject to IDA's prior approval.&#13;
3.24  Incremental Operating Costs. The project would finance about half (US$0.85 million) of the&#13;
incremental operating costs (US$1.70 million) to be incurred by MAFWE over the life of the project.&#13;
Incremental operating costs would include local travel costs, maintenance of vehicles, fuel (which the&#13;
Government buys in bulk), and office supplies. The procurement of project items under incremental&#13;
recurrent costs would follow standard government procedures requiring multiple quotations for&#13;
procurement of goods, which are acceptable to the IDA. Disbursement for incremental operating costs&#13;
would decline from 70% initially in 1996 to 40% by 1999. At negotiations, agreement was reached on&#13;
the baseline against which incremental costs would be measured, items eligible for IDA financing, annual&#13;
disbursement percentages and documentation required (para 6.01 (d)).&#13;
3.25  IDA's Prior Review and Monitoring of Procurement. Contracts and related documentation&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review and approval would include: (i) all ICB and LIB contracts; (ii) IS contracts&#13;
above US$100,000; (iii) first two national shopping contracts; (iv) all direct purchase contracts; (v)&#13;
consultant services contracts estimated at US$50,000 or higher, which would specifically include approval&#13;
of short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, and evaluation reports; (vii) the terms of&#13;
reference of all consultants, employment of individuals, single source selection of firms, key assignments,&#13;
and contract amendments including amendments raising the contract value above US$50,000; (vii) course&#13;
contents and terms of reference for all training programs and study tours; and (viii) and TORs and&#13;
research priorities under Agriculture Research program. MAFWE would promptly inform the IDA of&#13;
contract awards and procurement issues, and would maintain- detailed documentation. Procurement&#13;
activities not requiring IDA's prior review would be monitored by IDA supervision missions. The&#13;
MAFWE would submit to the IDA quarterly procurement progress reports on all procurement activities&#13;
being financed under the Project.&#13;
E. Disbursements&#13;
3.26   The proposed IDA Credit is expected to be disbursed over a period of four years (Annex 4). The&#13;
proposed closing date would be September 30, 2000. Disbursements would be made against the&#13;
following categories:&#13;

a) Net of taxes and duties&#13;
3.27   Disbursements against contracts for goods above US$100,000 equivalent and for services above&#13;
US$50,000 would be made against standard documentation. For contracts below that level, which would&#13;
include agricultural research contracts, support grants under Category 4(Grants) and incremental operating&#13;
costs under Category 5, disbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
In order to enable the IDA and external auditors to verify disbursement expenditures, MAFWE would&#13;
retain disbursement documentation for at least one year following the submission to IDA of an audit&#13;
report for the fiscal year in which the audited disbursement were made.&#13;
3.28   Special Account. To facilitate project implementation MAFWE would establish, maintain and&#13;
operate a Special Account (SA) in DM under terms, conditions and in a bank acceptable to IDA. An&#13;
initial SA allocation of DM 0.35 million would be increased to full authorized amount of DM 0.7 million&#13;
when cumulative disbursements under the project have reached SDR 0.8 million. This was confirmed&#13;
at negotiations (para 6.01(e)). IDA would replenish the SA on a quarterly basis, or when the balance&#13;
declines to about half of the initial deposit or the authorized allocation, whichever comes first. Payments&#13;
from the SA would only be made for eligible expenditures and would be supported by documents&#13;
including a copy of the monthly bank statement of the SA as well as its reconciliation with the SA&#13;
transactions. All other applications for direct payment by IDA would be for an amount not less than 20%&#13;
of the SA deposit.&#13;
F. Reports and Audits&#13;
3.29   The Project Manager would be responsible for all project reporting to IDA. Under the Project&#13;
Manager's overall guidance, MAFWE's Budget and Finance Department would maintain detailed project&#13;
accounts and regularly submit semi-annual statements of expenditure to IDA by the following schedule:&#13;
(i) statement for the period of January through June would be submitted by September 1; and (ii)&#13;
statement for the period July to December would be submitted by March 1. Project accounts would be&#13;
audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit report would cover the project accounts,&#13;
Statements of Expenses, and the Special Account. The audit report would be submitted to IDA within&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
of the end of each fiscal year. Agreement to these arrangements were confirmed at negotiations (para&#13;
6.01 (f)).&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Management&#13;
4.01   The Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy would have overall responsibility for&#13;
project implementation. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) with terms and conditions satisfactory to&#13;
IDA has been established (and agreed to be maintained during project) to advise the Minister of MAFWE&#13;
on project-related matters and to ensure adequate inter-ministerial coordination in project implementation.&#13;
The PSC to be chaired by the Minister, MAFWE, would meet quarterly and would include&#13;
representatives of the private sector, farmers, SOM, the Ministries of Finance, Science, and&#13;
Development, and MAFWE. A Project Manager, has been appointed by MAFWE, who would oversee&#13;
and coordinate all project activities. It was agreed at negotiations the Project Manager would have&#13;
adequate authority and delegation from the Minister to carry out the day-to-day affairs of the Project&#13;
efficiently. These authorities would include issuance of bidding documents, evaluation of bids, placement&#13;
of orders, arrangements for training, management of consultants, hiring of "coordinators" payment of&#13;
bills, disbursement, etc., within the parameters of the agreed project. The Project Manager would serve&#13;
as secretary to the PSC. Day-to-day management responsibility would be devolved to the Department&#13;
or Agency head responsible for specific project components, e.g., the MES, ARC, Veterinary&#13;
Management Unit, and SOM to whom project coordinators hired under the project would be assigned.&#13;
Furthermore, at negotiations it was also agreed the MAFWE would maintain during project&#13;
implementation an adequate staff for the Project Manager, satisfactory to IDA (para 6.01(g)). At&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached on a project implementation plan presented in Annex 5, (6.01 (h)).&#13;
B. Project Implementation&#13;
4.02   Project Preparation Facility. The Government has engaged the services of a consulting firm&#13;
under the PPF to assist in developing key project components. The consulting firm has held a series of&#13;
seminars in rural areas to: (i) familiarize farmers and MES staff with recent developments in extension&#13;
delivery; and (ii) develop a study tour program to Poland, Denmark and the U.K. for April 1996 in&#13;
which MES leaders and farmer representatives will participate. On return, the participants will be&#13;
involved in a national seminar in at which options for progressively transferring responsibility for&#13;
management and financing of extension services to communities, farmers' associations, and/or agro-&#13;
business will be discussed. The consulting firm is also helping to develop concepts for market news&#13;
service in cooperation with the SOM. This part of the PPF activity has completed a diagnostic of SOM's&#13;
current capacity and developed an action plan that will enable the MAFWE and SOM provide daily price&#13;
information from six domestic horticultural and two livestock markets by July 1996. Initial linkage to&#13;
several EU reference markets will be made as well. In addition, an action plan has also been developed&#13;
to prepare SOM staff to be able to provide periodic (weekly/monthly) analysis of price trends, for&#13;
example. Lastly, the consulting firm has provided to MAFWE's legal staff expert advise on pending&#13;
legislation related to denationalization of land, land use, privatization of agri-kombinats and cooperative&#13;
law. This service will be available to the MAFWE through the Institute of Eastern European Law,&#13;
Leiden, The Netherlands, through September 1996.&#13;
4.03   Agricultural Advisory Services. The MES would be responsible for the implementation of pilot&#13;
initiatives and country-wide improvements in the provision of advisory services. To assist the MES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Director, a project coordinator for the advisory services component would be appointed whose&#13;
responsibilities would include assisting in overseeing the training programs and support the formation of&#13;
farmer groups/associations for obtaining agricultural advisory services. The longer term structure and&#13;
management of the MES would be studied by a special commission, appointed by the Government&#13;
representing public and private sector interests across the agricultural sector. In public and private&#13;
hearings, the Commission would consider public and private sector extension roles, opportunities for&#13;
MES self-financing/cost-recovery, ways to improve administrative and operational efficiency, and other&#13;
reforms. The analysis, satisfactory to IDA, is expected to be completed by June 1997. Further details&#13;
on implementation is provide in Annex 5. For 1997, and subsequent project years, the MAFWE would&#13;
present annual plans defining cost sharing arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, before any disbursements&#13;
are made for the respective year for farmers advisory services (para 6.02(a)).&#13;
4.04   Adaptive Agricultural Research. The MAFWE has appointed a Senior Scientific Adviser (SSA)&#13;
qualifications satisfactory to IDA, who would administer the research grant program. The MAFWE has&#13;
also appointed an Agricultural Research Committee (ARC) whose responsibilities would include&#13;
establishment of research priorities and evaluating proposals for funding from the Research Grant Fund.&#13;
ARC membership would come from a cross section of individuals with first hand experience with applied&#13;
problems and opportunities facing private farmers, as well as to provide a balance between public and&#13;
with private sectors. The ARC would be chaired by the SSA. Research contracts to qualified institutions&#13;
and individuals that meet the established criteria, and acceptable, to IDA would be made. The MAFWE&#13;
would establish by June 30, 1996 and maintain a Research Grant Fund of US$0.5 million equivalent. The&#13;
guidelines for awarding research grants were agreed to at negotiations (para 6.01 (i)). For 1997 and&#13;
subsequent project years the MAFWE would present annual plans defining priorities, satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
before any disbursements are made for the respective year for agriculture research (para 6.02(b)).&#13;
4.05   Animal Health Program. The veterinary service privatization program would be managed by&#13;
the MAFWE's Veterinary Management Unit in close collaboration with the Veterinary Chamber. The&#13;
Veterinary Privatization Fund would be used to encourage public sector veterinarians to privatize. Under&#13;
the matching grant program, Government would meet 40% of the costs associated with establishing a&#13;
private veterinary practice. At negotiations agreement was reached on the establishment by June 30,&#13;
1996, and maintenance of the Veterinary Development Fund with guidelines satisfactory to IDA, for&#13;
participation by veterinarians (para 6.01 ()). Private veterinarian in-service training would be provided&#13;
under a project financed program designed to provide additional technical, business, and management&#13;
skills necessary for a private veterinary practice. The Veterinary Chamber would be responsible for the&#13;
selection of courses. The Epidemiological Unit of the Veterinary Management Unit would implement&#13;
the epidemiology program. For 1997 and subsequent project years the MAFWE would present annual&#13;
plans defining cost sharing arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, before any disbursements are made for the&#13;
respective year for the veterinary privatization services (para 6.02(c)).&#13;
4.06   Market Information. The Agriculture Department of SOM would manage the development of&#13;
the market information service. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed between the&#13;
MAFWE and SOM to formalize implementation responsibilities.&#13;
4.07   Rural Financial Services. The Project Manager would supervise the overall implementation of&#13;
this component. Together with the international farm credit specialist, six farm credit specialists for a&#13;
two-year term would be provided to be posted to the six strengthened opstina extension offices (para.&#13;
3.13). The Project Manager with the help of management consulting firm would also supervise special&#13;
studies (e.g., chattel mortgage). The Consultant, under the direction of the Project Manager, would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
work with the National Bank of Macedonia (NBM) to implement the technical assistance and training for&#13;
the PFIs under the PSDP. For the implementation of the SA component, the Government, subsequent&#13;
to the review of the SA initiative, would present to IDA for review and approval a plan for supporting&#13;
strengthening and expansion of SAs before any disbursements are made on this component (para 6.02(d).&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
4.08   No negative environmental impacts are foreseen.  The agricultural research and extension&#13;
components are expected to promote more appropriate use of agricultural chemicals, IPM technologies&#13;
(in accordance with relevant World Bank Group Guidelines), conservation tillage, and, in general, more&#13;
prudent, cost-effective use of agricultural inputs. The market information services components are&#13;
expected to make producers and agro-business people aware of particular niche markets in the EU for&#13;
"green" products. The project has been placed in environmental category "B. " A National Environmental&#13;
Action Plan is being prepared by the borrower and is expected to be completed in July 1996.&#13;
C. Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.09   Monitoring of the project's impact on the private farming community would be carried out&#13;
through annual farm monitoring exercises. The evaluation of the agricultural research grant fund would&#13;
assess the practical impact of the research findings. In addition, performance indicators (Annex 2) for&#13;
each project components would be monitored by the Project Manager. The analysis of the 1994 census&#13;
would provide the baseline data for the status of farmers with respect to their income and productivity&#13;
levels. It is expected to be available in June 1996. Monitoring of the project's physical inputs&#13;
(equipment, vehicles, training costs, etc.,) would be the responsibility of the MAFWE's Project Manager.&#13;
The financial indicators would be maintained by staff of the MAFWE's Administrative, Legal Affairs&#13;
and Finance Department.&#13;
4.10   By July 1998, the MES is expected to commission an independent evaluation of the cost-sharing&#13;
advisory services activity under the project. Three key indicators: (i) farmers' opinions concerning the&#13;
quality of their advisory services; (ii) MES's support for the farmer groups; and (iii) the support by&#13;
private farmers for their own advisory services as measured by the proportion of costs carried by the&#13;
farmers themselves. Based on this analysis, the evaluator would make recommendations on future&#13;
modifications of this component. The MES in the second, third and fourth project years would&#13;
commission an independent survey to evaluate of the effectiveness, from the farmers perspective, of the&#13;
MES extension programs. The terms of reference for these surveys would be agreed to with IDA. The&#13;
MES would also monitor the effectiveness of the participatory farm system constraint analysis carried out;&#13;
staff training under the project; the number and effectiveness of professionally produced video and audio&#13;
cassette programs; and numbers of village discussion groups by opstina and their attendance profile over&#13;
time.&#13;
4.11   The SSA would monitor the agricultural research grants program. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
would consist of economic evaluation of the research findings, an assessment of the suitability of the&#13;
results by a sample of potential users of the research results and the adaption of innovations. The Project&#13;
Manager would monitor the planning and design work for the establishment of the horticulture wholesale&#13;
market. The market news service would be evaluated on the basis of its commercial desirability and use&#13;
by commercial TV and radio stations as well as by surveys of readers/listeners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
D. Project Supervision&#13;
4.12   A "project launch" workshop is planned for September 1996. Two to three supervision missions&#13;
a year are planned with staff input of about 20 weeks the first year, 15 weeks the second year, and 15&#13;
weeks in each of the last two years.  Initially, intensive supervision would be required for the&#13;
development of a market news service, planning of the private wholesale horticulture market for Skopje,&#13;
the national extension program, and forming of partnership between farmer associations and MES.&#13;
4.13   A Mid-Term Review, with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA would take place no latter than&#13;
March 31, 1998 (para 6.01 (k)). It would focus on progress in formation of farmer associations/groups&#13;
for advisory services, the privatization of veterinary services, use and acceptability of the market news&#13;
service, measures to improve access of farmers commercial credit and results of applied agricultural&#13;
research. The review would evaluate progress and, if warranted, would consider changes in project&#13;
design.&#13;
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.01   Quantifying the incremental benefits of this sort of project is problematic given the institutional&#13;
development nature of project activities and numerous non-service factors influencing decision-making&#13;
at the farm level. Nevertheless, as approximation, indicative financial and economic farm models were&#13;
analyzed during project preparation to assess the likely impact of project activities at the farm level.&#13;
Farm modeling of typical private farms in dairy, vegetables, apples and field crops suggest economic&#13;
rates of return ranging from 15% to over 50% could be obtained from modest, new technological&#13;
packages that would flow from applied research, better advisory services, better animal husbandry and&#13;
new investment.&#13;
5.02   The proposed project as a whole would have two main benefits. First, private farmers would&#13;
receive better support from the various public and private services, which would increase their production&#13;
and incomes. Second, this project would pilot initiatives, for example, in advisory and veterinary&#13;
services that would establish an experience base to gradually replace obsolete public support services with&#13;
private services, thus enabling a reduction in the amount of government funding that is being provided&#13;
to the sector for these kind of services. The project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy which has identified agriculture as one of the main sectors with promising growth potential.&#13;
5.03   Private farmers would be the principal beneficiaries, deriving advantage from more effective&#13;
support and advice on production technology, marketing information, animal health services and credit.&#13;
The farm models cited above suggest that the family incomes from new innovations including financing,&#13;
could result in increases in annual family incomes, using 1994 prices, of US$370 for a 2 ha crop farm&#13;
in the Bitola region, US$2,400 for a 1/2 ha. intensive vegetable grower in the Strumica area, US$5,600&#13;
for a I ha Resin apple grower that replaces his/her current variety and US$6,600 for a 4 cow dairy&#13;
farmer, or increases from 10 to over 50%.&#13;
5.04   A  principal benefit from  upgrading the animal quarantine services and improving the&#13;
epidemiological capacity would be to assist in maintaining access for Macedonian livestock products to&#13;
the EU market. In 1994 that market was worth about US$1 10 million. Two years earlier, because of a&#13;
breakdown in border control, large numbers of infected dairy/beef cattle were shipping into and through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
the country. This resulted in Macedonian livestock products being denied access to EU markets for one&#13;
year, as well as requiring a large, expensive eradication program. The modest, US$1.1 million project&#13;
investment in this component, would pay for itself many times over if it only avoided one year of lost&#13;
international markets.&#13;
5.05   Ex-post analysis of agricultural research typically comes up with high returns to investments in&#13;
research. However, ex-ante, it is problematic to predict which research and when the research will&#13;
produce the technological innovation(s) which would produce those typical high returns. Nevertheless,&#13;
we can estimate, for illustrative purposes, some returns that can be reasonably be expected to flow from&#13;
the kind of applied research envisioned for the project. For example, one of the priority research areas&#13;
is IPM. Currently about US$3 million (retail) of herbicides (2,4-D, Trifluralin, etc.,) are used on about&#13;
100,000 ha of cereals and 10,000 ha of vegetables. It is expected that applied research should be able&#13;
to adopt new IPM technology to Macedonian conditions whereby at least a 30 percent savings in herbicide&#13;
use per ha could be realized. Still, if only a fifteen percent savings are realized, it would save cereal and&#13;
vegetable farmers using herbicides something on the order of US$450,000 annually in production costs&#13;
on the same area. This of course would also reduce the potential for residual groundwater contamination&#13;
but no value is estimated for this benefit, though it is significant.&#13;
5.06   Similarly, conservation tillage, another priority area for research, offers promising returns.&#13;
Typically these new tillage practices can increase the effective amount of moisture available to a crop by&#13;
20 - 30 percent through increased infiltration (through less runoff) and reduced evaporation. This in turn&#13;
should easily enable a 10 percent increase in cereal yields, although in drought years this would be even&#13;
higher. In 1994, a dry year, if average wheat yields were 10 percent greater on half of the cultivated&#13;
wheat area, i.e., about 58,000 ha, that would have increased wheat production by about 13,000 tons; at&#13;
US$130 per ton, that would be worth about US$1.7 million. So, while returns to research can not be&#13;
fully assured, the two examples above suggest that even with modest assumptions as to the value of&#13;
technological innovations, the returns to investments in agricultural research promise to be substantial.&#13;
5.07   Greater involvement of farmers in the provision of support services in which they share&#13;
ownership and cost with Government would improve the quality and increase service coverage and better&#13;
respond to their needs. MAFWE and MES staff would become better motivated and more accountable&#13;
to farmers and be better able to meet the demands of the emerging commercial, family farms. Currently,&#13;
a typical MES opstina level office, including a director, three high level staff and two technicians costs&#13;
about US$52,000 per year to run, with about US$40,000 accounted for by salaries. If a farmer&#13;
organization would take over this function, which is possible, the maximum obligation on the MES would&#13;
be US$8,000 in the first year, and US$6,000 thereafter offering a potential savings to the Government&#13;
of US$46,000 per year. Success with this pilot and expansion of this model to 30 opstinas implies that&#13;
the savings to Government per annum would be on the order of US$1.4 million in 1996 dollars.&#13;
However, this project does not suggest total phasing out of MES services in that there is an important,&#13;
although redefined role for public support for advisory services. If even half, or US$0.7 million, could&#13;
be saved per year, the payback time on this component (US$3.32 million) would be five years.&#13;
5.08   SOM would become more efficient in providing market information which would enable farmers,&#13;
traders and agro-businesses to respond more effectively to market opportunities. The value of timely,&#13;
accurate market information is difficult to estimate, although it is generally agreed that this is essential&#13;
for a market economy to work efficiently. (The investment costs for this component is US$0.7 million.)&#13;
These services are intended to be sold as they become standard, accepted and producers, traders and&#13;
processors learn to depend on them. In the longer-run, it is expected that this service would become a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
private sector business. The rural financial services component would provide short-run assistance&#13;
(US$0.4 million) to those private farmers that may want to obtain short or medium-term credit during&#13;
the first two years of the project. With a 15% return on investment, we could expect that this would&#13;
return to those private farmers who take advantage of this credit at least an addition $500,000 of income&#13;
in the first two years of the project. More importantly, however, is the building up a client base for the&#13;
newly commercialized banks in the agricultural sector, something that would not happen in the absence&#13;
of this project given the lack of experience the PFIs have had with private farmers and their general&#13;
reluctance to lend to the sector in the first place.&#13;
Poverty Impact&#13;
5.09   The impact of project activities on poverty reduction in rural areas would be largely indirect.&#13;
Poor farmers are located mainly in remote, mountain areas with poor access and only marginal&#13;
agricultural potential. In general, private farmers have a more secure economic base than families&#13;
dependent on employment in industry. About half of the farmers derive their income from full-time farm&#13;
work; the other half supplements farm income with off-farm employment. The project is classified as&#13;
a "Not in the Program of Targeted Interventions."&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
5.10   The principal risks are economic and geo-political. Economic risks stem from the possibility of&#13;
macroeconomic destabilization and delays in structural reforms. However, the Government continues&#13;
to adhere to its reform program and contemplates new reform measures including the privatization of&#13;
agri-kombinats and further reforms of agricultural price and trade policy. The reopening of the country's&#13;
southern border, and more recently the ending of the Serbian embargo, should help in stimulating trade&#13;
and private sector development. The reforms supported by the FESAC, together with on-going dialogue&#13;
with the IMF to extend the Stand-by Arrangement and the Bank Group on a proposed SAL should reduce&#13;
tie risk of policy slippage. Geo-political risks stemming from regional conflicts and ethnic strife in the&#13;
Balkan region remain an overhanging risk.&#13;
5.11   Project specific risks relate mainly to potential resistance at the operational level by various public&#13;
institutions and services involved in the project to give up traditional influence and responsibilities. This&#13;
would be mitigated by an intensive retraining program and seminars explaining the rationale for the&#13;
changes introduced under the project. Another risk relates to the relatively large number of small&#13;
contracts to be awarded under the project and the difficulty of their close supervision. Procurement&#13;
training has been provided already to MAFWE staff. The Project Manager would be responsible for&#13;
proper application of procedures. Finally, cost-sharing arrangements in the provision of advisory services&#13;
to farmers may encounter poor receptivity due to past experience with Government. This risk would be&#13;
mitigated by developing strong incentives for community participation. The proposed Mid-Term Review&#13;
would provide an opportunity to review and change project design if required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
PRIVATE FARMER SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
Project Preparation Fadlity&#13;
1.    The Government has engaged the services of a consulting firm under the PPF to assist in&#13;
developing key project components using participatory techniques. The consulting firm is holding a series&#13;
of two-day seminars in rural areas to:  (i) familiarize farmers and extension staff with recent&#13;
developments and trends in extension delivery systems; (ii) identify possible modalities for farmer&#13;
supported and/or private participation in the delivery of extension and information services; (iii) identify&#13;
possible initial participants and supporting farmer/agribusiness organizations. Also, the seminars would&#13;
help to identify options for progressively transferring responsibility for the management and for financing&#13;
of extension services to communities, farmers' associations, and/or agro-business. The seminars would&#13;
help to identify private farm leaders and extension professionals for participation in a study tour to&#13;
selected countries. Following seminars in rural areas, a national extension seminar would be held to&#13;
seek consensus on the most appropriate means of reforming the extension services and the MES. The&#13;
consulting firm is also helping to develop concepts for market news service using available information.&#13;
It is working with MAFWE's legal staff and local specialists, also funded under the PPF, to review&#13;
pending MAFWE draft legislation related to denationalization of land, privatization of agri-kombinats and&#13;
other priority regulations. It would also review progress and evaluate initial experience with privatization&#13;
of agri-kombinats.&#13;
Agricultural Advisory Services&#13;
2.    The MES would be responsible for the implementation of pilot initiatives and essential country-&#13;
wide improvements in the provision of agricultural advisory services. To assist the MES Director, a&#13;
project coordinator for the advisory services component would be appointed whose responsibilities would&#13;
include assisting in overseeing the training programs and support the formation of farmer&#13;
groups/associations for obtaining agricultural advisory services. MES headquarters staff would cooperate&#13;
with consultants and farm leaders in identifying counterparts for pilot initiatives, including the&#13;
development of cost-sharing arrangements, satisfactory to the World Bank, with farmer organizations,&#13;
facilitate research/extension linkages, provide skill gap based extension training, facilitate information&#13;
flow, and contribute to the development of mass media communication materials. MES regional staff&#13;
would oversee the implementation of pilot cost-sharing initiatives.&#13;
3.     The MES, working with leaders of farmer groups/associations, community leaders and/or NGO&#13;
leaders would encourage these kind of groups to take charge of organizing the kind of advisory services&#13;
they determine would best meet their needs, including the hiring of their own advisors or contracting with&#13;
a private firms to provide such services. While this initiative is anticipated to shift some of the advisory&#13;
costs to farmers, the MES would provide incentives to such groups as special training for advisors at no&#13;
cost to the farmer groups, but primarily through the establishment of an Agricultural Advisory Services&#13;
Fund for cost-sharing arrangements with farmer groups. For cost-sharing specifically, the MES would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-                                    Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
agree with each group to cost-sharing on a declining scale from 75% in the group's first year, 65% in&#13;
its second and third year, 50% in its fourth year and thereafter at a mutually agreed ratio, but not more&#13;
than US$6,000 per year to any one group. The MES would also provide a one-time, start-up matching&#13;
grant, on the basis of 1/3 farmer group and 2/3 from the MES, not exceeding US$2,000 per association.&#13;
Overall the cost-sharing support from the MES is anticipated to cover costs of advisors, but could also&#13;
cover handbooks, special training programs and office equipment and/or other costs determined&#13;
appropriate by each particular group's assessment of their needs. Financing would expand gradually from&#13;
six pilot initiatives to about 40.&#13;
4.    The MES would ensure that results from participative farm system constraint analysis is fed back&#13;
to the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), collect regional farm management information, develop farm&#13;
models, and monitor the impact of price and cost changes on farm incomes. Opstina-level programs&#13;
would principally, through farmer discussion groups, use on-farm demonstrations, and mass media tools.&#13;
The village community would become the focal point for opstina level extension agents. NEIS activities&#13;
would be overseen by farmers' boards. At the opstina level, farmers would be nominated by local&#13;
councils for board positions. Opstina boards would nominate representatives to their respective region,&#13;
which in turn would nominate two representatives to the national MES board. Generally, board&#13;
appointments would be for two years and board meetings would be held quarterly.&#13;
5.    The longer term  structure and management of the MES would be studied by a special&#13;
commission, appointed by the Government representing public and private sector interests across the&#13;
agricultural sector. In public and private hearings, the Commission would consider public and private&#13;
sector extension roles, opportunities for MES self-financing/cost-recovery, ways to improve administrative&#13;
and operational efficiency and other reforms. The analysis, satisfactory to the World Bank, is expected&#13;
to be completed by June 1997.&#13;
6.    A key activity would be training-of-trainers program for MES staff and other selected trainers.&#13;
Eligible candidates would have an agricultural degree or diploma, preferably a post-graduate degree in&#13;
agricultural economics or farm management, at least two years of field experience, good communication&#13;
skills, and some English language skills. The trainers would complete an intensive two-month course.&#13;
An essential part of the training would be a course in participatory rural appraisal in at least one agro-&#13;
ecological zone and farming system. Four months after the course, the training specialist would conduct&#13;
a one-week refresher and evaluation course. Subsequently, a retraining program would be expanded for&#13;
MES staff at all levels, organized by the training coordinator. Each two-week course would be for about&#13;
10 staff. Each staff member would complete the initial two-week course, followed four weeks later by&#13;
a one-week refresher and follow-up seminar. This training would include a practical field exercise&#13;
followed by additional training and evaluation. An independent evaluation of the training program would&#13;
be conducted in the second year of the program under a contract with terms of reference agreed with the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
Agricultural Research&#13;
7.    As agreed with MOS, the MAFWE would have overall responsibility for the program. The&#13;
MAFWE has appointed an Agricultural Research Committee (ARC) whose responsibilities would include&#13;
review and approval of research priorities and in evaluating proposals for funding from the Research&#13;
Grant Fund. The MAFWE has also appointed a Senior Scientific Advisor (SSA), under the PFSP, to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

assist the PFSP Project Manager (PM) in managing and administering day to day activities of the&#13;
program. The Ministry would establish the Agricultural Research Grant Fund no later than June 30,&#13;
1996. The guidelines for awarding research grants were agreed at negotiations.&#13;
8.    ARC membership would come from a cross section of experienced individuals with experience&#13;
with applied problems and opportunities facing farmers, as well as to provide a balance between public&#13;
and with private sectors. ARC membership would include one representatives from MAFWE, Ministry&#13;
of Science, the Faculty of Agriculture, the MES, private farmers (one each representing grain, livestock&#13;
and horticultural producers), and a representative of agribusiness. The ARC would be chaired by the&#13;
SSA.&#13;
9.    The first year of the program are expected to feature seven, broad priority areas, specifically: 1)&#13;
Integrated pest management (IPM), 2) Animal husbandry, 3) Farm management, 4) Water use&#13;
efficiency, 5) Conservation tillage, 6) Pasture and range management, and 7) Evaluation of new&#13;
horticultural varieties. As the program gains experience, the ARC will consider changing economic&#13;
circumstances, in particular agricultural trade opportunities, experience with previous adaptive research,&#13;
and the findings of the MES diagnostic surveys to modify priority areas as appropriate.&#13;
10.   The research envisioned to be carried out under the adaptive research program would be on&#13;
applied, practical problems facing farmers and agribusiness. (The program is not intended to fund basic,&#13;
strategic research, which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Science.) Adaptive research typical of&#13;
projects that could be funded might include the identification of more economic and appropriate level of&#13;
herbicides; modification to livestock housing to reduce infectious diseases; identification of new&#13;
fruit/vegetable varieties that would fit niche, export markets; new tillage practices and/or tillage&#13;
equipment that would evaluate alternative high residue tillage techniques; and farm level cost of&#13;
production studies, for example.&#13;
Animal Health Program&#13;
11.   The veterinary service privatization program would be managed by the Veterinary Management&#13;
Unit in close collaboration with the Veterinary Chamber. The Veterinary Development Fund would be&#13;
used to encourage public sector veterinarians to privatize.  Under the matching grant program,&#13;
Government would meet 50% of the costs associated with establishing a private veterinary practice. Any&#13;
veterinarian willing to leave government service and able to fund 50% of his/her costs of establishing a&#13;
private practice would be eligible. A limit of US$15,000 per veterinary station' would be established.&#13;
Support would be restricted under the matching grant scheme to equipment directly related to income&#13;
generating activities such as for disease diagnosis, pregnancy testing, artificial insemination, and&#13;
laboratory sample analysis. At negotiations agreement has been reached on the establishment and&#13;
maintenance of the Veterinary Privatization Fund by June 30, 1996, with guidelines satisfactory to the&#13;
World Bank, for participation by veterinarians.&#13;
12.   Private veterinarian in-service training would be provided under a project financed program&#13;
designed to provide additional technical, business, and management skills necessary for a private&#13;
' Station refers to clinic or surgery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

veterinary practice. Up to two private veterinarians per veterinary station would have access to an&#13;
introductory course in computers, business practices and re related office and data management software&#13;
use. The project would also contract for the provision of short courses for private veterinarians on&#13;
technical subjects including whole herd health and production management, ruminant and non-ruminant&#13;
nutrition, management-related diseases and internal parasites. The Veterinary Chamber would be&#13;
responsible for the selection of courses.&#13;
13.   The Epidemiological Unit of the Veterinary Management Unit would implement the epidemiology&#13;
program. It would contract with the Veterinary Institute for sample analysis, private veterinary stations&#13;
for sample collection, herd health monitoring and vaccination campaigns. Work plans would be&#13;
developed by the Epidemiological Unit on regional bases in collaboration with MES services. The&#13;
Epidemiological Unit would manage programs, analyze and report results, and, in collaboration with&#13;
MAFWE, develop associated policy and cost-effective disease control strategies.&#13;
Market Information&#13;
14.   The Agriculture Department of SOM would manage the development of the market information&#13;
service. A MOU between the MAFWE and SOM has been signed to formalize implementation&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
Rural Financial Services&#13;
15.   The Project Manager would supervise the overall implementation of this component. Together&#13;
with the international farm credit specialist, six farm credit specialists for a two-year term would be&#13;
posted to the six strengthened opstina extension offices. The Project Manager with the help of&#13;
Management Consulting firm would also supervise special studies. The international farm credit specialist&#13;
would assist MAFWE's legal staff in reviewing pending legislation. Concerning implementation of the&#13;
SA component, the Government, subsequent to a review of the SA initiative, would present to the World&#13;
Bank for review and approval a plan for supporting strengthening and expansion of SAs before any&#13;
disbursements are made on this component.&#13;

            Macedonia - Private Farmer Support Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Private Farmer Support Project will
            support the economic transformation process by strengthening
            the provision of technology and information related services
            to private farmers, thereby improving their production and
            income. The project will change mechanisms for provision of
            technical services to private farmers and initiate important
            changes in the public institutions providing such services.
            It will be implemented over three and a half years. Project
            funds will be used for technical specialists, training,
            equipment, vehicles, and small support grants. The project
            will include the following main components: 1) pilot
            initiatives to develop cost-sharing arrangements with farmer
            associations, to decentralize extension management and
            responsibility for support to farmers, and to strengthen
            Macedonian Extension Service's extension capacity; 2)
            support for applied agricultural research through
            competitively-awarded contracts; 3) support for
            privatization of veterinary services and development of
            public epidemiological and quarantine services; 4)
            development of a market news/information service and
            planning work for a private horticulture wholesale market;
            5) assistance to improve farmers' access to commercial
            credit and to evaluate the feasibility of an apex
            organization for rural, member-owned Savings Associations;
            and 6) assistance to selected commercial banks to improve
            their capacity to facilitate expansion of financial services.
