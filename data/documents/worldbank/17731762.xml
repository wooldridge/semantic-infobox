&amp;#12;I.   STRATEGIC CONTEXT&#13;
&#13;
A.     Country Context&#13;
&#13;
1.     Located in the Gulf of Guinea between Benin and Ghana, Togo is one of the smaller&#13;
countries in Africa. Also bounded by Burkina Faso to the north, Togo is a small country with&#13;
an estimated surface area of 56 600 square km and a population of 6.5 million with an annual&#13;
population growth of about 2.84%. Togo is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per&#13;
capita GDP of US$570 in 2011 (according to the World Bank's Atlas methodology), and a&#13;
ranking of 139 out of 169 countries in the 2010 UNDP Human Development Index.&#13;
&#13;
2. The main economic activities are mining, agriculture, sea port activities and re-&#13;
exporting. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the population and accounts for about 45% of&#13;
gross domestic product (GDP). The secondary sector, including phosphates, cement&#13;
manufacturing, construction and energy employs about 12% of the population and accounts for&#13;
about 22% of GDP. Services, dominated by commerce and transport, employ about 21% of the&#13;
population and generate about 33% of GDP. The most important exports are cement and clinker&#13;
which go entirely to West African regional markets where demand remains strong, followed by&#13;
cotton, both processed and marketed by public enterprises. Togo also produces cash crops,&#13;
mainly coffee and cocoa, and has a considerable agricultural potential.&#13;
&#13;
3. Economic growth accelerated slightly in 2011. Togoâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth, which was&#13;
estimated at 3.7% for 2010, rose to 3.9% in 2011, thanks to satisfactory rainfall, improved power&#13;
supply and an increase in the port activity. It is expected to reach 5.2% in 2012, spurred, among&#13;
other things, by new investments in infrastructure and higher government spending, and thanks&#13;
to lower debt-servicing costs following debt relief, and continuing structural reforms. The&#13;
recovery in the cotton sector, the buoyant activity at the Port of LomÃ© (especially the increase in&#13;
transit trade), and the public works launched by the government also contribute to this growth&#13;
performance. In December 2010, Togo successfully reached the completion point under the&#13;
Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and also qualified for additional debt relief under the Multilateral&#13;
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).&#13;
&#13;
4. Togo has achieved considerable progress during the past three years, but significant&#13;
institutional and economic challenges remain. The rise in oil and food prices, the severe&#13;
flooding in 2008 and 2010, and the global recession in 2009 adversely impacted Togoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economy. With regard to the Millennium Development Goals, progress has been achieved toward&#13;
reaching the goals of universal primary education and the combat of HIV/AIDS. However, Togo&#13;
is unlikely to meet six of the eight goals by the 2015 deadline. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s business&#13;
environment remains difficult, as highlighted by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Doing Business 2012â&#128;?&#13;
report, which ranks Togo 162nd (out of 183 countries).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                1&#13;
&amp;#12;B.     Sectoral and Institutional Context&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Togoâ&#128;&#153;s telecommunication sector has significant untapped potential. With a mobile phone&#13;
penetration in 2012 of 53.93%, and a growth rate of around 13.5 per cent, Togoâ&#128;&#153;s mobile&#13;
telephony sector is not living up to its potential. Togo's mobile market continues to be run under&#13;
a duopoly regime with Togo Cellular, the mobile unit of fixed-line incumbent operator Togo&#13;
Telecom, and Etisalat-owned Moov. Togo Cellular has a subscriber base of around 1.6 million at&#13;
the end of December 2012, and a market share of 51%. Second-ranked Moov had around 1.5&#13;
million subscribers at the end of December 2012, a market share of 49%. Togo Cellulaire enjoys&#13;
87 per cent of the volume (dialled-out minutes) and 79 per cent of turnover. Currently there are&#13;
only about 76,678 mobile 3G subscribers, all on Togo Cellular (MOOV has yet to provide 3G&#13;
services).&#13;
&#13;
6. Togo's fixed voice and data/Internet market is dominated by state-owned incumbent&#13;
operator Togo Telecom. The operator offers ADSL broadband and CDMA-based narrowband&#13;
services to corporate and residential users. There were 240,512 fixed-line connections in Togo at&#13;
the end of December 2011, a penetration rate of 3.8%. Togo Telecom launched its CDMA-based&#13;
wireless local loop service under the brand Illico in 2006. The service's good coverage and low&#13;
prices have made it especially popular in rural areas. The service also allows users to use e-mail&#13;
and access Internet pages at low speeds on their mobile phones. There were 5,081 ADSL and&#13;
171,174 Illico subscribers at the end of 2011. There is only one private Internet provider â&#128;&#147; Cafe&#13;
Informatique â&#128;&#147; which provides WIFI connectivity, mainly to corporate clients.&#13;
&#13;
7. The number of Internet subscribers remains very limited in Togo and growth in the&#13;
Internet industry is still slow and highly constrained by limited access and high cost to end&#13;
users. Togo had around 371,000 regular Internet users and 77,826 broadband subscriptions, with&#13;
internet and broadband penetration rates of 6% and 0.6% respectively. This is expected to&#13;
increase significantly over the next few years as a result of the recent connection to the West&#13;
Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable, which now lands in LomÃ©, the extension of the&#13;
Togo Telecom's national fibre backbone and introduction of 3G services in the market. Currently,&#13;
Togolese consumers pay higher rates for Internet services than consumers in neighbouring&#13;
countries. As of June 30, 2012, business users and private citizens have to pay US$160 per&#13;
month for fixed broadband Internet access, while consumers in Senegal and Ghana pay only&#13;
US$29 and US$64 respectively. The cost of dedicated 2 Mbps link is as high as 2,348&#13;
US$/month. The high cost of broadband Internet access prevents Togo from reaping the benefits&#13;
of the ICT revolution. High cost can be attributed to several factors such as (i) the high cost of&#13;
international bandwidth, especially before Togo Telecom was able to secure Togoâ&#128;&#153;s first&#13;
connection to a submarine cable; (ii) the lack of an Internet Exchange Point (IXP) to reduce the&#13;
cost of local Internet traffic; (iii) a monopoly structure for access to international capacity; and&#13;
(v) limited regulatory activity to promote more competition or fair and equitable access to&#13;
bandwidth. These constraints are currently being tackled by WARCIP project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 2&#13;
&amp;#12;8. The connectivity status of Togo has improved dramatically in the last few years thanks&#13;
to investments by Togo Telecom, but fixed access remains solely owned and managed by&#13;
Togo Telecom. Togo is now connected to WACS submarine cable with a landing station in&#13;
LomÃ©. The 14, 500 km WACS cable has an ultimate capacity of 5.12Tbps. The cable became&#13;
operational in Togo in May 11, 2012. It links countries in Southern Africa, West Africa and&#13;
Europe, providing direct access to other global submarine cables. Specifically the WACS system&#13;
links South Africa to the UK with landings in Namibia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of&#13;
Congo, Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Cote dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, Cape Verde, the Canary&#13;
Islands and Portugal. The network cost approximately CFA325 billion (USD634 million) for the&#13;
twelve countries participating in the rollout, of which Togo contributed CFA13 billion (USD25.4&#13;
million), excluding charges for delivery and distribution of its bandwidth locally. As the only&#13;
financier of the cable landing in Togo, Togo Telecom has exclusive rights to the landing station&#13;
and to WACS capacity. In addition Togo Telecom has rolled-out a national backbone up to the&#13;
country's borders, ensuring the connectivity of Togo with Benin, Burkina Faso and Ghana, and&#13;
creating additional access to other submarine cables via neighbouring countries (ACE, SAT-3,&#13;
Glo-1 and Main One). The fibre-optic network across Togo is expected to create a high capacity,&#13;
reliable backhaul system, helping to connect landlocked countries in West Africa to international&#13;
submarine cable systems through Togo Telecom's cable landing station. However, although Togo&#13;
Telecom's investment in WACS and its national backbone has created a reliable and potentially&#13;
cost-effective national and international infrastructure, as a monopoly, Togo Telecom has no&#13;
incentive lower prices, and the benefits of the investment for the country will not be fully&#13;
realised unless the capacity is available to all operators on an equal basis.&#13;
&#13;
9. The GoT is now starting to implement a comprehensive ICT sector reform process. The&#13;
Government adopted a Sectoral Strategy on Promoting Information and Communication&#13;
Technologies (ICT) 2011-2015 in May 2011. This strategy lays down an ambitious vision for the&#13;
sector focusing on free market forces and strengthening the legal and regulatory framework. The&#13;
strategy intends to develop the telecom infrastructure (which includes investments in&#13;
international and regional/national connectivity) and to stimulate reliance on ICT. The stated&#13;
objective is to increase the fixed and mobile phone penetration rates to 60 per cent by 2015 and&#13;
the Internet penetration rate to 15 per cent, from less than 1 per cent today. The strategy is based&#13;
on a holistic approach around four pillars: (1) Strengthen legal and regulatory framework and&#13;
regulation; (2) promotion of free market competition; (3) Develop infrastructure; and (4)&#13;
Improve and stimulate usage of ICT.&#13;
&#13;
10. A New Legal framework was approved on December 17, 2012. The Electronic&#13;
Communications Law (Law No. 2012-018), modified by Law No. 2013-003 of February 19,&#13;
2013, repeals the outdated Law No. 98-005 and constitutes an important development in the&#13;
sector, reflecting latest technological and market developments, as well as ECOWAS Directives&#13;
and UEMOA additional Acts. The main objectives of the new law are to strengthen competition,&#13;
stimulate investment, increase access and improve regulation of the sector. The new law creates&#13;
a new converged regulator, the AutoritÃ© de rÃ©gulation des communications Ã©lÃ©ctroniques,&#13;
(ARCE), which replaces ART&amp;P as the sector regulator, and a new agency for the regulation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 3&#13;
&amp;#12;radio spectrum, the Agence Nationale du Spectres des Radio Frequences (ANSR). The&#13;
Government is working on developing secondary legislation and drafting decrees for the&#13;
implementation of the new law.1&#13;
&#13;
11. Government has adopted several reform priorities aimed at increasing competition and&#13;
levelling the playing field between different sector players. These reforms are unfolding&#13;
through policy and regulatory decisions and include (i) lowering the price of mobile&#13;
communications and bring it closer to regional benchmarks2, (ii) opening up the mobile sector to&#13;
more competition through issuing MVNO licenses3, (iii) moving to full competition in the&#13;
Internet sector with a plan to issue additional ISP licenses4 and (iv) starting the process of&#13;
restructuring of Togo Telecom5, (v) ensuring fair and equal access to the WACS submarine cable&#13;
capacity and (vii) lifting restrictions on building fiber optic transport infrastructure by licensed&#13;
operators6, and (viii) putting in place regulatory mechanisms to ensure fair competition and limit&#13;
market dominance in the sector. The different priorities are at different implementation phases.&#13;
Once fully implemented, these reforms are expected to have far reaching impacts on the sector.7&#13;
The reforms are initiated by the Government and supported by the Bank through multiple&#13;
instruments including budget support operation, technical Assistance and trust fund resources.&#13;
&#13;
12. WARCIP Togo Project will focus on sectoral efficiency and improving the reach of&#13;
broadband networks at lower cost. The project proposes a mix of interventions covering&#13;
investment focused on improving connectivity through (a) establishment of a neutral carrier hotel&#13;
and national / regional IXP, where a market and a national / regional hub for capacity could be&#13;
established to provide an alternative to Togo Telecom, which would improve terms of access to&#13;
international capacity and lower costs through increased competition and (b) supply of bulk&#13;
international bandwidth capacity to ensure that international capacity is available to the country&#13;
at the lowest cost and highest quality, WARCIP Togo will provide resources for the launch of a&#13;
competitive tender to purchase high capacity bandwidth from neighbouring coastal countries to&#13;
be delivered at the neutral carrier hotel in the capital. By doing so, Togo will benefit from similar&#13;
conditions of access to connectivity (diversity of choice, low prices) as other countries in the&#13;
ECOWAS region. The project will also focus on creating an enabling environment through&#13;
technical assistance to strengthen the legal, regulatory and institutional framework to ensure&#13;
open access, create PPP frameworks and improve regulatory environment to increase&#13;
competition in the sector and improve overall sector efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  The list of decrees currently under preparation with support of an international law firm includes, among others, decrees for the&#13;
establishment of ARCE and ANSR, decrees for open access to submarine cable capacity, infrastructure sharing, interconnection&#13;
and colocation, spectrum management and national roaming.&#13;
2 The prices have fallen by 30% between 2011 and 2013, from US$ 0.23/minute for on net calls to US$ 0.17/minute. Dropping&#13;
the prices to regional average was one of the telecom prior actions for the DPO operation.&#13;
3 The MVNO process was launched in September 2012. A shortlist of potential operators has been established&#13;
4 The ISP licensing process is expected to start following the study recently launched by the Ministry.&#13;
5 The procurement process for hiring auditors and for launching a study on strategic repositioning of Togo telecom reached&#13;
shortlisting stage.&#13;
6 The Government is currently negotiating standard 3 G licenses for TogoCell and Moov which will include the authorization to&#13;
operate their own international gateway and lifts earlier restrictions to build fiber infrastructure.&#13;
7 The different reforms priorities are at different implementation stages and have been linked to triggers in budget support&#13;
operation.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;13. With a strong regional rationale, the WARCIP Togo project will contribute to the&#13;
creation of the ECOWAS regional telecommunications market, contributing further to&#13;
regional integration and economic growth. Like the other phases of the WARCIP program,&#13;
WARCIP Togo has a strong regional rationale. The implementation of the Adaptable Program&#13;
Loan (APL 2) would better integrate Togo within the region, allowing increased regional trade as&#13;
well as improving Togoâ&#128;&#153;s opportunity to become more competitive internationally. Togo has a&#13;
particularly important geographic position in West Africa, enjoying a central position for&#13;
distributing capacity to its landlocked neighbours. Also, through its access to the WACS cable&#13;
system, the addition of Togo to the WARCIP program brings additional redundancy, creating&#13;
more competition between cable systems in the region (so far all previous WARCIP Phases&#13;
focused on the ACE cable8). If priced competitively, Togoâ&#128;&#153;s facilities would provide important&#13;
alternative international routes in the region - for Burkina Faso in particular, but also potentially&#13;
as a backup route for Benin and Niger. While these countries all have other neighbours from&#13;
which to obtain international capacity, most of them will be likely route at least 20-30% of their&#13;
traffic via Togo to maintain their restoration links. In addition, the proposed carrier hotel will&#13;
create incentives for cross-border connections and local hosting, which will provide domestic&#13;
backup and secure alternate international routes via Ghana and Benin (which have 6 different&#13;
submarine cable landings between them). Aside from improving reliability, this also provides&#13;
competitive alternative routes to WACS, ensuring that domestic prices for international capacity&#13;
are kept low. This will give Togo a highly reliable and much more affordable ICT infrastructure,&#13;
which will also see demand from across the nation's borders. Connectivity financed under the&#13;
WARCIP program will thus contribute to a fully redundant regional network, allowing&#13;
landlocked countries to access alternative and competitive routes to submarine landing stations in&#13;
coastal countries9. This will lead to lower wholesale costs for connectivity throughout the region,&#13;
which will create the necessary environment for lower retail prices for consumers and&#13;
businesses.&#13;
&#13;
C.       Higher Level Objectives to which the project Contributes&#13;
&#13;
14. WARCIP Togo project is aligned with the 2nd Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for the&#13;
period FY12-FY13. The overall objective of the proposed ISN is to support Togoâ&#128;&#153;s program of&#13;
recovery from its long period of instability to promote growth and reduce poverty and will focus&#13;
on three main objectives: (a) Deepening the economic recovery process and promoting&#13;
sustainable development; (b) Supporting economic governance and transparency; and (c)&#13;
Addressing urgent poverty reduction and social needs. The operation will support objective (a) of&#13;
the ISN by improved access to and quality of productive infrastructure. It will also contribute to&#13;
objective (b) by improving through ICT the delivery of public services in similar conditions of&#13;
costs and quality throughout the country. Through purchase of capacity on fiber-based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8 The ACE submarine cable is connecting Europe with 13 countries along the West African coast (Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia,&#13;
Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, SÃ£o TomÃ©).&#13;
9 The lack of regional/national competitive fiber infrastructure compared to the extent of supply and competition in submarine&#13;
cables is demonstrated by the fact that capacity from an African submarine landing station to Europe (costing $100-&#13;
$300/Mbps/month) is usually cheaper than the in-country national backbone capacity ($500-2000/Mbps/month). This trend is&#13;
accentuated considerably for landlocked countries, which have to pay for terrestrial transit across their neighbors to get to the&#13;
coast.&#13;
&#13;
                                                               5&#13;
&amp;#12;transmission networks to connect targeted users (e.g. schools, universities, hospitals, and other&#13;
priority groups) with discounted capacity prices, the operation will support objective (c) of the&#13;
ISN.&#13;
&#13;
15. WARCIP Togo is fully aligned with the World Bank Partnering for Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Regional&#13;
Integration: Progress Report on the Regional Integration Assistance Strategy for Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa (RIAS) dated March 21, 2011 and the new WBG ICT strategy. The updated&#13;
RIAS seeks to create economies of scale, facilitate intra-regional trade and exports, and connect&#13;
landlocked countries to regional and global trade routes by reducing barriers to movement of&#13;
goods and services between countries. It recognizes the key role ICTs can play in regional&#13;
integration and increasing competitiveness of African economies. The project is also fully in line&#13;
with the new World Bank Africa Strategy, Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Future and the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support to it,&#13;
dated March 2011. By facilitating cheaper access to the Internet and supporting the development&#13;
of national and regional communications infrastructure, the project would promote&#13;
competitiveness and sustainable employment (Pillar 1: Competitiveness and Employment) of the&#13;
Africa strategy. It would also focus on partnerships by leveraging private sector investments in&#13;
shared infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
16. Improving connectivity in Togo is expected to accelerate the realization of an integrated&#13;
regional ICT market. The AICD10 report highlights the importance of regional integration, in&#13;
particular for the smaller countries in the region which could each independently spend between&#13;
5-30 per cent of their GDP on addressing infrastructure gaps, in contrast with 1 per cent of&#13;
regional GDP. Integrating and sharing physical infrastructure could allow countries to gain&#13;
economy of scale, harness regional public goods and enable deeper economic growth. A regional&#13;
approach to addressing the combined effects of the three level connectivity gaps could reduce&#13;
the cost for each of the countries involved, and result in positive effects on prices and capacity,&#13;
increased availability of end-to-end high-capacity bandwidth at competitive rates and hence&#13;
broadband provisioning within the region.&#13;
&#13;
17. An integrated ICT market would stimulate economic growth and enhance trade. The&#13;
regionâ&#128;&#153;s prosperity depends on how well it is integrated into the global economy. Information&#13;
and Communication Technologies (ICT), particularly high-speed Internet, is playing an&#13;
increasingly central role in this - enhancing trade, facilitating cross-border payments, increasing&#13;
productivity and improving the quality of public service delivery â&#128;&#147; all key components of&#13;
economic growth and poverty reduction. A number of ECOWAS countries are at the initial stages&#13;
of positioning themselves as preferred destinations for Information Technologies (IT) and IT&#13;
Enabled Services (ITES) in the region.&#13;
&#13;
18. Intensification of broadband networks will stimulate investment and economic growth.&#13;
The contribution of broadband networks to economic growth is much more pronounced than that&#13;
of narrowband networks. Studies have confirmed that for every 10 percentage-point increase in&#13;
high-speed internet connections, there is an increase in economic growth of 1.3 percentage&#13;
points.11 New businesses in the ICT and IT enabled services sectors are supported by improved&#13;
access to high-speed internet. More generally, the remarkable contribution of ICT to economic&#13;

&amp;#12; growth has been demonstrated in many studies. For example, a recent cross-country analysis&#13;
 found that the growth effect of ICT can be significantly stronger in developing countries than in&#13;
 developed countries. The contribution of ICT to one of the key pre-requisites for attracting&#13;
 investment - improved governance, accountability and transparency - is also increasingly&#13;
 apparent.&#13;
&#13;
II.      PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES (PDO)&#13;
&#13;
 A.      PDO&#13;
&#13;
 19. The PDO for WARCIP Togo is to increase the geographical reach of broadband networks&#13;
 and to reduce costs of communications services in the territory of the Republic of Togo12.&#13;
&#13;
 20. The project has three main components with the ultimate aim being to enhance Togoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 economic integration in the region- The project proposes an integrated approach focusing on&#13;
 (i) improving connectivity; and (ii) creating an enabling environment, dealing with improving&#13;
 sectoral efficiency and institutional strengthening to remove existing bottlenecks for private&#13;
 sector participation in ICT infrastructure development.&#13;
&#13;
 B.      Project Beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
 21. Direct beneficiaries of the project include people who are connected to the&#13;
 communications network in the Republic of Togo. These include telecommunication and&#13;
 internet services users, schools, hospitals, banks, corporations, government and public&#13;
 administrations, to be measured as the number of active fixed and mobile subscribers 13. Indirect&#13;
 beneficiaries potentially include all of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s population, since increased communications&#13;
 capabilities at affordable rates for some of the population are expected to eventually have&#13;
 externalities for all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 12 This is the same PDO as the WARCIP Program and applies to all countries joining the program. In the specific&#13;
 case of Togo improving broadband access will be through financing a carrier hotel and purchasing international bulk&#13;
 bandwidth) to ensure competition for international connectivity and reduce costs.&#13;

III.       PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
 22. WARCIP Togo will be executed over a five-year period with a total IDA financing of&#13;
 US$ 30 million. It will include a set of well-defined project activities grouped under three broad&#13;
 components (see Annex 2 for detailed breakdown of the main proposed project components).&#13;
&#13;
 A.        Project Components&#13;
&#13;
   23. Component 1- Supporting Connectivity (US$ 16 million). The Component will have&#13;
   financing and support for 2 main activities: (i) establishing a carrier hotel and national / regional&#13;
   IXP where a bandwidth market and a national / regional hub for capacity could be established in&#13;
   order to improve terms of access to international capacity at lower costs, and any resettlement&#13;
   costs associated to this; and (ii) purchase of bulk international bandwidth capacity to ensure that&#13;
   international (and national) capacity is available to the country at the lowest cost and highest&#13;
   quality. WARCIP Togo will provide resources for the launch of a competitive tender to purchase&#13;
   high capacity bandwidth from neighbouring coastal countries to be delivered at the carrier hotel.&#13;
   By doing so, Togo will benefit from similar conditions of access to connectivity (diversity of&#13;
   choice, low prices) as other countries in the ECOWAS region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                8&#13;
&amp;#12; 24. Component 2 - Creating an Enabling Environment for Connectivity (US$ 11.5 million).&#13;
 This component will focus on (i) the transactional design and operating model for ownership of&#13;
 the carrier hotel as well as its management using PPP arrangements, and support for the&#13;
 competitive tender for the international bandwidth; (ii) development of open access principles to&#13;
 create an enabling environment for improved connectivity, specifically through support to the&#13;
 regulator to develop regulatory instruments for open access to capacity and to ensure that the&#13;
 benefits of lower prices trickle down to end users on the retail level; (iii) policy and regulatory&#13;
 support to improve sectoral efficiency, including price regulation and market competition, in&#13;
 application of the new ICT policy; and (iv) institutional strengthening to the Ministry, to the&#13;
 regulatory authority and to the SPV. A detailed list of activities is provided in Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
25. Component 3: Project Implementation, Communications and M&amp;E (US$ 2.5 million).&#13;
This component will provide support needed to strengthen the capacity of the Government to&#13;
implement the connectivity project, including setting up a Project Implementation Unit (PIU)&#13;
located within the Line Ministry and covering office equipment, operating costs, trainings . The&#13;
component will also cover the cost audits, communications, monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E),&#13;
and environmental and social studies, including their implementation and/or the monitoring of&#13;
their implementation.&#13;
&#13;
B.         Project Financing&#13;
&#13;
26. Lending Instrument- Lending will be via an APL. The lending instrument is an APL.&#13;
WARCIP-Togo is an investment operation under the second phase of the regional WARCIP&#13;
program14. The project will be financed with an IDA credit with a maturity of 40 years including&#13;
a grace period of 10 years.&#13;
&#13;
27. Breakdown of Regional and National IDA allocations. Activities under the proposed&#13;
project meet the regionality criteria and therefore are eligible for regional IDA funding. The&#13;
table below provides a summary of project cost per component.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.        Program Objective and Phases&#13;
&#13;
28. The proposed operation comes under the second phase of the APL for WARCIP, which&#13;
was approved on January 20, 2011. WARCIP is a World Bank regional APL instrument that&#13;
seeks to contribute to increasing the geographical reach of broadband networks and reducing&#13;
costs of communications services in West Africa. As indicated in the WARCIP Appraisal&#13;
Document, countries join different phases of the program based on their readiness. Triggers&#13;
include (i) government commitment to liberalization and open access principles, (ii) existence of&#13;
a PPP framework (or willingness to formulate one as part of preparatory activities), and (iii)&#13;
                                                        10&#13;
&amp;#12;government commitment to increased sector competition as evidenced by pro-competitive policy&#13;
and regulatory frameworks. The GoT shows a strong commitment to opening the&#13;
telecommunications market to competition and implementing sector reforms.&#13;
&#13;
29. The GoT has expressed interest to join WARCIP and demonstrates readiness to meet&#13;
the Programâ&#128;&#153;s triggers for PPPs and open access: The GoT made a request to join WARCIP in&#13;
July 2011 and received a Project Preparation Advance (PPA) to conduct preparatory activities&#13;
related to establishing a PPP framework and open access regime for the carrier hotel and to put in&#13;
place an open access regime. In addition, the GoT has committed to improve sector efficiency&#13;
through a number of on-going reforms including launching the process for licensing new ISPs15,&#13;
a process for issuing MVNO licenses and restructuring Togo Telecom, and include dominance&#13;
based regulatory framework to ensure fair competition in the market. The GoT has also&#13;
committed to adopt PPP and open access principles to ensure fair and open access to this critical&#13;
asset for the sector. The reform agenda is being carried out with support of the budget support&#13;
operation and Technical Assistance support through non lending TA and complementary trust&#13;
fund resources.&#13;
&#13;
D.      Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design&#13;
&#13;
30. Country commitment to the proposed project is important. The proposed project draws&#13;
on lessons learned from previous and on-going World Bank-financed projects in ICT and from&#13;
on-going efforts in countries in similar situations as Togo. Broad global experience in ICT&#13;
project implementation indicates that ICT project success is primarily contingent on strong&#13;
country commitment to implementation. The proposed project design has been guided by the&#13;
telecommunications sector national policy. GoTâ&#128;&#153;s request to include specific regulatory activity&#13;
support as part of the project design reflects its commitment to pursue the reform of the ICT&#13;
sector and accelerate the implementation of its National Information and Communications&#13;
Infrastructure (NICI) strategy.&#13;
&#13;
31. Technical assistance needed to support implementation of project activities. Experience&#13;
in several countries has shown that significant capacity is needed for negotiations with the&#13;
private sector to establish PPP arrangements. Given the low capacity of the institutions involved&#13;
in project implementation, the project provides financing for extensive technical assistance to&#13;
allow for detailed design of the PPP agreements and other technical activities under the project,&#13;
with significant involvement financed by the PPA. The technical assistance will also provide&#13;
support, where needed, for the formulation of the bidding documentation and technical&#13;
specifications in relevant project components. Regulatory capacity is necessary to enable fair&#13;
competition as problems can and will develop over time. Building such capacity takes time. At&#13;
the same time, Togo could benefit from the extensive experience of other countries in this area.&#13;
The proposed project focuses on building this capacity in the regulatory authority by using in-&#13;
house training, study tours, twinning arrangements and creating opportunities for peer-to-peer&#13;
learning from more advanced regulators and the sharing of experiences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15&#13;
 The process is delayed. The regulatory authority prepared the bidding documents but process was not launched&#13;
waiting for additional reviews from experienced consultants.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       11&#13;
&amp;#12; 32. The project also builds also on specific lessons learned in the preparation of the several&#13;
 sequences of the first phase of WARCIP, APL 1A, APL 1B, APL 1C, as well as from the&#13;
 follow on phases of CAB, APL 2 and APL 4, and from CARCIP in another region. The&#13;
 Bank has developed a substantial experience in coordinating and financing similar ICT projects&#13;
 in the world in general, and Africa in particular. In the East and Southern Africa, the World Bank&#13;
 has approved a US$424 million Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (RCIP)&#13;
 covering about 25 countries. The World Bank Group (WBG) also recently approved a US$215&#13;
 million Central Africa Backbone Program which will leverage existing fiber and provide&#13;
 improved connectivity to the region. The Caribbean Infrastructure Program (CARCIP) is a&#13;
 US$98 million facility approved in May 2012. These experiences are being leveraged in the&#13;
 preparation of WARCIP Togo.&#13;
&#13;
 33. The project is benefitting from the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s experience in PPPs: The World Bank has had&#13;
 extensive experience in supporting Governments to structure PPPs for international, regional and&#13;
 national connectivity. In general, it has been observed that international connectivity projects,&#13;
 often led by private consortia, have attracted significant private capital, have been completed&#13;
 relatively faster, and tended to more successful in structuring partnerships between the public&#13;
 and private sectors that involve equity ownership of both parties, through SPVs, with operation&#13;
 left to the private sector. Challenges in structuring PPPs have included: (i) inadequate trust and&#13;
 cooperative relationships between government and private sector and between competitors â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
 WBG has been instrumental in mediating and developing transparent governance frameworks,&#13;
 (ii) inability of governments to provide effective regulations, and therefore any solution that&#13;
 depends solely on the regulator is likely to fail â&#128;&#147; the WBG has supported the development of&#13;
 robust transaction agreements which include clear rules of engagement, (iii) high cost of quality&#13;
 expert advisory services for design, management of tenders and negotiation of contracts, and&#13;
 countriesâ&#128;&#153; reluctance to invest their limited resources on such expertise and (iv) WBG support&#13;
 systems not ideally suited for PPPs (procurement, legal, disbursement) â&#128;&#147; increasing efforts have&#13;
 been made to improve Bank support but more needs to be done. Specific experience from earlier&#13;
 ACE related projects, as well as from WARCIP Burkina Faso has been instrumental in shaping&#13;
 this operation by focusing on securing private sector interest during early project preparation&#13;
 stage to increase buy in and commitment from the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
IV.      IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
 A.      Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
 34. The project will be implemented under the aegis of the Ministry of Posts and&#13;
 Telecommunications (MPT) for Togo. A separate PIU is being established under the PPA. The&#13;
 core PIUs staff will consist of a project coordinator, procurement specialist, financial specialist,&#13;
 a technical expert and an office assistant16. The PIU core team will be strengthened by hiring an&#13;
 M&amp;E specialist and contracting with an environmental and social safeguards consultant who will&#13;
 work closely with Agence Nationale de la Gestion Environnemtale (ANGE) to ensure safeguard&#13;
 compliance of project components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 16&#13;
  A recruitment firm was hired under the PPA to assist the Ministry with the recruitment process of the PIU&#13;
 members. Negotiations are on-going with the shortlisted candidates.&#13;
&#13;
                                                         12&#13;
&amp;#12;35. The PIU will be assisted by a project team called â&#128;&#156;focal Unit forumâ&#128;?, composed of&#13;
representatives from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT), the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MoF), Ministry of Public Works, the Regulatory Authority and from representatives&#13;
of telecom operators. The focal units are not consultants hired under the project but rather staff&#13;
of their respective institutions and therefore not eligible for funding under the project.&#13;
&#13;
B.     Results Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
 36. The PIU will monitor and evaluate the project. The PIU will bear the primary&#13;
responsibility for project M&amp;E of both project progress and project outcomes, and, as such, will&#13;
establish standard formats and guidelines for data collection and reporting, and will organize&#13;
training sessions for project stakeholders in their use. The PIU will submit to the Ministry the&#13;
M&amp;E a semester report that will include the updated Results Framework and the Action Table,&#13;
listing the corrective actions to be implemented with deadlines and persons responsible clearly&#13;
identified. The report will be sent to the Bank for information.&#13;
&#13;
 37. The views of direct beneficiaries will be brought into the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
process. Comprehensive M&amp;E reporting will be needed to monitor the results and performance&#13;
of the proposed project. It will involve mainly the direct beneficiaries of project activities, but&#13;
will be extended to other beneficiaries such as telecommunications operators and private ICT&#13;
firms, which ultimately are the main beneficiaries of the proposed projectâ&#128;&#153;s outcomes. The PIU&#13;
will review and validate the reports on performance indicators and recommend corrective actions&#13;
if necessary. There will be focal units as to who will be responsible for providing relevant&#13;
information and monitoring progress, using relevant performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
C.     Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
 38. Improved access and lower prices will be sustained. Improved service coverage and&#13;
quality at more competitive prices for international, regional and national connectivity and for&#13;
data services will be sustained as it will create opportunities for advanced applications, using&#13;
more bandwidth and creating more traffic.&#13;
&#13;
 39. Legal and regulatory reform is expected to have a sustainable impact. Predictability&#13;
and transparency of the legal and regulatory framework that is conducive to private sector&#13;
participation and competition will increase the demand for affordable quality ICT services,&#13;
including advanced applications. Given that a number of private operators already exist in the&#13;
market and that there is potential for additional players beyond the current wireless sector, it is&#13;
likely that the regulatory authority will have sufficient resources and capacity through license&#13;
and regulatory fees to become a self-funded institution and sustain the required regulatory&#13;
capacity to supervise sector development.&#13;
&#13;
 40. Local capacity will be strengthened through training and technical assistance. The&#13;
project will make significant investments in capacity-building efforts through training and&#13;
technical assistance to build technical expertise, social capital and knowledge. With the focus on&#13;
building sustainable capacity in key institutions such MPT and theregulatory authority, the&#13;
benefits of the project are expected to last far beyond program completion. As such, capacity will&#13;
&#13;
                                                13&#13;
&amp;#12; support the creation of ICT policy and regulatory know-how to guide sector growth and&#13;
 transformational applications in the future.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                     Risk                                                 Rating&#13;

                       L - Low, M - Moderate, S â&#128;&#147; Substantial, H â&#128;&#147; High&#13;
&#13;
 B.      Overall Risk Rating Explanation&#13;
&#13;
 41. The overall risk for preparation is rated S (substantial). The risk rating is based on&#13;
 country risks, difficulties of establishing a PPP framework. While there are a number of risks&#13;
 involved (see above), actions contemplated under the PPA as well as under the enabling&#13;
 environment component of the project for these risks to be contained and appropriate mitigation&#13;
 measures to be put in place. The overall risk for implementation is rated S (Substantial). The PPP&#13;
 model, although used in other countries participating in WARCIP, will be new to the telecom&#13;
 sector in Togo. Risks of delays by cautious stakeholders may affect the projectâ&#128;&#153;s execution.&#13;
 There are also risks linked to the timely implementation of infrastructure and to the risks linked&#13;
 to weak implementation capacity. The risks will be evaluated regularly during project&#13;
 implementation and updated accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
VI.     APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
 A.     Economic and financial Analysis&#13;
&#13;
 42. Open and non-discriminatory access to the carrier hotel is needed to meet existing and&#13;
 future demand for reliable and affordable capacity. Togo is currently dependent on a single&#13;
 submarine cable â&#128;&#147; WACS - for its international capacity requirements. Currently this capacity is&#13;
 owned and managed exclusively by Togo Telecom without open access principles. A PPP&#13;
 framework to allow additional capacity to be available at the carrier hotel will create an access to&#13;
 this capacity on open and non-discriminatory terms is key for the development of the broadband&#13;
 market in Togo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    14&#13;
&amp;#12;43. The datacenter carrier hotel (and IXP) will create improved connectivity by allowing&#13;
the different operators to have alternative and additional access beyond WACS. Carriers&#13;
with international infrastructure would all connect with the Carrier Hotel to provide services to&#13;
other operators/large users and also to ensure the security and redundancy of their own links by&#13;
having a single point from which to cross-connect. The presence of the Carrier Hotel would also&#13;
attract other international operators (as well as content providers) to land their fibre infrastructure&#13;
and data servers there, as the most cost effective place to meet, peer, and trade capacity. This&#13;
passive infrastructure reduces the cost for the local operators to connect to international&#13;
infrastructure by just having one place to connect with, and creates a more fluid open market for&#13;
capacity, because local operators and users can switch between suppliers in seconds, (or change&#13;
the volume of capacity obtained from each of their suppliers) simply through a configuration&#13;
change on the router or changing a cross-connect cable on the fibre switchboard. This will pave&#13;
the way for successful development of regional and local content and applications.&#13;
&#13;
44. Depending on the revenue model and capacity pricing adopted, the investment in the&#13;
Carrier Hotel in Togo will breakeven by 2017-2019 after which the project will be cash-flow&#13;
positive if wholesale pricing levels are maintained. The investment will see Togo breakeven by&#13;
2017-2019, depending on the wholesale price adopted, with an NPV to 2023 of US$8.49 million&#13;
and an IRR of 26.6%, (assuming an average wholesale bandwidth sale price of&#13;
US$200/Mbps/month, declining to US$100 in year 5), and an NPV US$ 958,628 and an of IRR&#13;
of 16.32%, assuming US$100/Mbps/month, declining to US$50, wholesale price. For Togo,&#13;
pricing capacity for traffic in the US$100-150/Mbps/month range is likely to be sustainable and&#13;
would stimulate use. This also takes into account bandwidth pricing trends in other regions such&#13;
as East Africa. The final breakeven year will depend on actual capacity uptake and the wholesale&#13;
price of bandwidth. After 2019 at the latest, the project would be cash-flow positive and&#13;
substantial revenues would be made if these wholesale pricing levels are maintained.&#13;
&#13;
45. The project will increase access to Internet, create jobs, improve education&#13;
opportunities and public administration and increase government revenues. The project&#13;
will bring significant benefits to Togo in a number of ways including (i) increased public access&#13;
to Internet services (ii) a broad range of social benefits through increased labor productivity,&#13;
employment creation, learning opportunities for youth, participation by women in the labor&#13;
market, and improved public administration (iii) greater fiscal returns due to new sources of&#13;
revenue for the GoT. It must be noted, however, that the economic and financial benefits of a&#13;
technical assistance component is generally difficult to quantify because of the inadequacy of&#13;
data available at the outset.&#13;
&#13;
B.     Technical&#13;
&#13;
46. The proposed project recognizes that infrastructure and policy environment&#13;
bottlenecks need to be dismantled to ensure better communications access. Technical design&#13;
of the project reflects lessons learned in the ICT sector and international best practices. For most&#13;
developing countries, a major obstacle to the uptake of ICT remains the lack of adequate access&#13;
to ICT infrastructure. A lack of investment in ICT infrastructure and access networks, coupled&#13;
with inefficient provision of services, are the most important factors undermining the&#13;
development of networked economies. The main lesson derived is that success is mainly market&#13;
&#13;
                                                  15&#13;
&amp;#12;driven. Creating a predictable legal and policy environment leading to effective competition in&#13;
the sector is key to improving investor confidence and restoring trust in the ICT sector. The&#13;
focus of the proposed project is to create a PPP framework for international connectivity. The&#13;
project will establish an enabling institutional and regulatory environment to help attract and&#13;
sustain investment in the telecommunications sector.&#13;
&#13;
47. Legal Due diligence- Regulatory Issues. The main issue is ensuring â&#128;&#156;open accessâ&#128;? (fair&#13;
and transparent pricing) to the bandwidth capacity arriving at the carrier hotel at the domestic&#13;
level. This is primarily a domestic regulatory issue. A review of the sector regulatory framework,&#13;
including licensing conditions, will be conducted at the national level. Significant reforms are&#13;
on-going in Togo. With the adoption of the new communications act, earlier legal restrictions for&#13;
building infrastructure by competing operators have been lifted. The new 3G licenses under&#13;
negotiations with the mobile operators give the right to the operators to operate their own&#13;
gateway and to build their own infrastructure. Additional support under the project will be given&#13;
to the Government to have a capacity pricing mechanism to ensure open access and detailed&#13;
support to enforce open access will be included in the project , based on needs assessment and&#13;
additional due diligence conducted under the PPA.&#13;
&#13;
C.         Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
48. The project team has assessed the financial management capacity of the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit being established within the Ministry of Posts and&#13;
Telecommunications (MPT) of Togo. The financial management assessment was carried out in&#13;
accordance with the Financial Management Manual issued by the Financial Management Board&#13;
on March 1, 2010. The objective of the assessment was to determine whether the Ministry had&#13;
acceptable financial management capacity. Arrangements are acceptable if they are capable of&#13;
recording accurately all transactions and balances, supporting the preparation of regular and&#13;
reliable financial statements, safeguarding the Projectâ&#128;&#153;s assets, and are subject to auditing&#13;
arrangements acceptable to the Bank. These arrangements should be in place when project&#13;
implementation starts and be maintained as such during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
49. The conclusion of the financial management assessment is that financial management&#13;
arrangements for the Project are being established in order to satisfy the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02, after which they will be adequate to provide,&#13;
with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the Project as&#13;
required by the Bank. The main areas of focus which are being financed with the project&#13;
preparation advance are: (i) the recruitment by effectiveness of an FM specialist with&#13;
qualifications and experiences satisfactory to the Bank17, (ii) the preparation, before negotiations&#13;
of an FM manual for the project18, and (iii) the set-up of accounting software, three months after&#13;
effectiveness. The overall fiduciary risk rating for the project is assessed as Substantial and is&#13;
expected to be moderate once the mitigation measures are implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
     The procurement process for the recruitment of the FM specialist is on-going.&#13;
18&#13;
     A draft Manual has been prepared before negotiations. The final draft is expected by June 30, 2013.&#13;
&#13;
                                                           16&#13;
&amp;#12;D.      Procurement&#13;
&#13;
50. A procurement assessment has been carried out on November 23, 2011 ; the main risks&#13;
identified are the lack of procurement capacity and the lack of procurement manual. The MPT&#13;
will carry-out procurement activities of the project through a PIU wish will be establish under&#13;
the MPT. This PIU is the process of being established and will be staffed by a Project&#13;
Coordinator, a Procurement Officer, a FM Specialist and an M&amp;E Specialist. The procurement&#13;
activities will be implemented using the national procurement institutional framework which is&#13;
in line with UEMOA Guidelines. The MPT has a Procurement unit (CPMP) and an internal&#13;
procurement control committee (CCMP). The National Department of Public Procurement&#13;
control (DNCMP) will have to exert an external procurement control for contract above the&#13;
CCMP accreditation thresholds. The project procurement risk has been rated as substantial.&#13;
&#13;
E.     Social and Environment&#13;
&#13;
51. The carrier hotel to be financed under the project is not expected to have significant&#13;
environmental impact. The physical components of this project will mostly be limited to&#13;
building IXP/Carrier Hotel/Datacenter and limited terrestrial fiber optic links to connect the&#13;
carrier hotel to the networks of the operators, if needed. The terrestrial fiber optic links are&#13;
expected to follow roads already in place and the IXP/Carrier Hotel/Datacenter to be built on a&#13;
site to be finalized among three possible sites. The proposed project is rated as a Category B.&#13;
52. The proposed project is expected to have positive social benefits. The main social&#13;
impacts of the proposed project are the increased possibility of better access to ICT services for&#13;
the population and improved GoT service delivery. The project will contribute to (i) enabling&#13;
ICT to become a driver for sustainable economic growth; (ii) enabling the GoT to use ICT to&#13;
improve services; (iii) improving access and quality of ICT services for the general population,&#13;
businesses, and the GoT; and (iv) reducing isolation and enhance economic activities.&#13;
53. Possible negative environmental and social impacts from the physical components are&#13;
limited. These could include soil erosion; soil and water pollution; loss of vegetation; the&#13;
disturbance on socio-economic activities and livelihoods located on the way noise; dust; risk of&#13;
accident and the generation of waste; risks of land acquisitions, possible destruction of crops.&#13;
The Environmental Safeguards Policies triggered are Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01),&#13;
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04), Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) and Involuntary&#13;
Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).&#13;
54. As the exact nature and location of investments may not be determined up front, the&#13;
GoT prepared and consulted upon an Environmental and Social Management Framework&#13;
(ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The ESMF outlines: (i) mitigation&#13;
measures of impacts of the fiber laying and building the carrier hotel including environmental&#13;
guidelines for contractors and guidelines applicable to health, safety and environment; (ii)&#13;
measures in case of archaeological discovery; (iii) institutional strengthening measures&#13;
(strengthening environmental expertise of the WARCIP PIU); (iv)strengthening technical&#13;
measures (provision for the implementation of environmental impact assessments ; monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of WARCIP); (v) information for stakeholders involved in the implementation of&#13;
the project and public awareness; (vi) a program of surveillance and monitoring; (vii)&#13;
&#13;
                                               17&#13;
&amp;#12;institutional responsibilities for environmental monitoring; (viii) the institutional arrangements&#13;
for implementing the ESMF; (ix) the recommendations for implementation; (x) the timing for the&#13;
implementation of measures and the costs of environmental and social measures. Based on the&#13;
outcomes of the screening process, the requirement to carry out an Environmental and Social&#13;
Impact Assessment (ESIA) that includes an Environmental and Social Management Plan&#13;
(ESMP) will be undertaken during project implementation in parallel with subcomponent&#13;
technical feasibility studies.&#13;
55. The proposed project is not expected to pose risks of damaging existing community&#13;
cultural property: The terrestrial fiber optic links will be built with the right-way of existing&#13;
roads and the IXP/Carrier Hotel/Datacenter will be built on an existing technical site; therefore it&#13;
is not expected to pose risks of damaging existing community cultural property. Nevertheless,&#13;
proposed Project activities will be screened for their potential impacts on cultural property and&#13;
chance find procedures will be applied and appropriate mitigation measures for both the&#13;
identification and protection of cultural property. The ESMF has provided the systematic steps&#13;
to be followed once these properties are discovered during project implementation.&#13;
56. The proposed activities under this operation should not cross natural parks or&#13;
reserves. However, the project includes special arrangements to avoid sensitive sites (wetlands&#13;
and critical natural habitats). If the works will result in any pressures on natural ecosystems,&#13;
fauna and flora, the ESMF has recommended steps to be followed during ESIA preparation in&#13;
addition to avoid these sites with the project design (to follow existing roads/railways as much as&#13;
possible).&#13;
57. The need for involuntary resettlement resulting from land acquisition in specific&#13;
subcomponents areas will only be known during project implementation when site-specific&#13;
plans are available. The prepared RPF includes guidance for preparing socio-economic surveys,&#13;
a census of people and assets, and appropriate eligibility and entitlement frameworks. Therefore,&#13;
Project subcomponents will be screened for application of the resettlement policy and any&#13;
subcomponents involving involuntary resettlement or land acquisition will only be approved&#13;
(and disbursed against) after preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The RPF has considered procedures for identifying eligible project-affected individuals,&#13;
calculating and delivering compensation, and determining mechanisms for land dispute&#13;
grievance redress as well as mechanisms for adequately monitoring and evaluating the level of&#13;
compliance.&#13;
58. Total cost of activities is estimated at US$ 406,000. While Credit funds will not finance&#13;
land acquisition, proceeds will be available to finance other resettlement costs. The ESMF and&#13;
RPF were reviewed and cleared by the Bank on March 18, 2013, and disclosed in the country&#13;
and at the Infoshop on March 19 and March 20, respectively.&#13;

&amp;#12;                            Annex 2: Detailed Project Description&#13;
                                      Country: Africa&#13;
                            Project Name: WARCIP APL2 - Togo&#13;
&#13;
1. Similarly to the previously approved WARCIP APL phases, WARCIP Togo will have three&#13;
components (i) Infrastructure component to improve connectivity; ii) Technical Assistance&#13;
component to create enabling environment; and (iii) Implementation support.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1- Supporting Connectivity (US$ 16 million)&#13;
&#13;
2. The connectivity component will focus on financing and support for (i) establishing a carrier&#13;
hotel and a national/regional Internet Exchange Point; and (ii) Supply of Bandwidth (International&#13;
Capacity Purchase) to create a market for connectivity at the carrier hotel.&#13;
&#13;
a. Establishment of a carrier hotel&#13;
&#13;
3. IDA funding will be used to establish a neutral 'carrier hotel' in LomÃ©. Carriers with&#13;
international infrastructure would all connect with the Carrier Hotel to provide services to other&#13;
operators/users and also to ensure the security and redundancy of their own links by having a&#13;
single point from which to cross-connect. The presence of the Carrier Hotel would also attract&#13;
other international operators (as well as content and application providers) to land their fiber&#13;
infrastructure and data servers there, as the most cost effective place to meet, peer, and trade&#13;
capacity. This would also be the ideal location for establishing the Internet Exchange Point&#13;
(IXP).&#13;
&#13;
4. In essence the facility would be what is also commonly known in the industry as a â&#128;&#156;Carrier&#13;
Neutral Data Centreâ&#128;&#153; which reduces the cost for the local operators to connect to international&#13;
infrastructure by just having one place to connect with, and creates a more fluid open market for&#13;
capacity, because local operators and users can switch between suppliers in seconds, (or change&#13;
the volume of capacity obtained from each of their suppliers) simply through a configuration&#13;
change on the router or changing a cross-connect cable on the fibre switchboard. Local and&#13;
offshore operators and content providers such as Google/Akamai would normally lease&#13;
capacity/access hosting facilities at the Carrier Hotel. In this respect the Carrier Hotel would&#13;
essentially be passive infrastructure with multiplex and switching equipment aimed at&#13;
guaranteeing fair and unfettered physical access on transparent and equal terms. The IXP and&#13;
data centre aspects would simply add additional provisions for a layer 2 switch, rack-space, air-&#13;
conditioning and redundant/backup power.&#13;
&#13;
5. This facility will be established as a Government owned SPV. The management of the carrier&#13;
hotel and the capacity that will be purchased under component 1 (b) will be through a PPP&#13;
contract. Both the SPV and the PPP arrangements are being prepared under the PPA.&#13;
Resettlement costs will be financed as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               25&#13;
&amp;#12;b. Supply of Bandwidth (International capacity Purchase) to create a market at the carrier&#13;
hotel&#13;
&#13;
6. Providing an opportunity for Togo to have competitive access to a submarine cable capacity&#13;
via one or more of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s neighbouring landing stations could substantially reduce the cost&#13;
of international connectivity, increase capacity and provide more effective redundancy. The high&#13;
cost of international connectivity is very much a core concern for operators in Togo currently&#13;
relying exclusively on Togo telecom for international connectivity through WACS cable. The&#13;
purchase of capacity will take the form of IRUs that will be purchased following an open&#13;
tendering process.. The operators will negotiate their own backhauling arrangements to channel&#13;
the purchased capacity to the carrier Hotel or build their own fibers if licensed to do so in Togo.&#13;
Running the process for capacity purchase will benefit from technical assistance support under&#13;
component 2 to ensure fair and competitive process.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2 - Creating an enabling environment for connectivity (US$ 11.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
7. This component will focus on (i) the design and operating model for ownership and&#13;
management the carrier hotel and purchase international bandwidth, (ii) related open access&#13;
principles and regulatory reforms to create an enabling environment for improved connectivity,&#13;
(iii) support for policy priorities in implementation of the sector policy, including improving&#13;
sector efficiency, price regulation and market competition, and (iv) institutional strengthening for&#13;
regulator and policy maker.&#13;
&#13;
8. Finalizing the transactional design and contractual arrangements for the SPV for the&#13;
ownership of carrier hotel, the PPP for the management of the infrastructure and supply of&#13;
international bandwidth: Under the PPA, consultants are in the process of being hired to finalize&#13;
the feasibility study for the carrier hotel and to support the Government to create to finalize&#13;
ownership and management structure for the infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
9. Addressing policy, market and regulatory bottlenecks to maximize the benefits of the&#13;
proposed connectivity agenda. Specifically, this activity will provide support to the regulator to&#13;
develop regulatory instruments for open access, including support for drafting IRU agreements,&#13;
and the wholesale regime for capacity pricing and other instruments to ensure open and non-&#13;
discriminatory access to the carrier hotel. Support will also be given to the regulator to ensure&#13;
that the benefits of connectivity translate into lower retail prices to end users.&#13;
&#13;
10. Supporting policy priorities in application of the ICT strategy; the project will support a&#13;
number of activities including a taxation study, creation of legal and regulatory framework for e-&#13;
society, study on broadband strategy, demand stimulation and implementation of application&#13;
pilots, support for the creation on the ICT agency and development of a program for ICT&#13;
training.&#13;
&#13;
11. Institutional strengthening: Institutional strengthening will be offered to (i) the regulatory&#13;
authority to enhance its capacity in regulating the ICT sector in areas related, among others, to&#13;
open access, regulatory instruments for dominance, and price regulation to acquire information&#13;
systems and equipment needed to strengthen its oversight on the sector (ii) National Agency for&#13;
&#13;
                                                26&#13;
&amp;#12;spectrum management to support its establishment and build its capacity on spectrum&#13;
management, (iii) the MPTâ&#128;&#153;s policy making functions; and (iv) SPV and PP through hiring and&#13;
building capacity of engineers to kick start the activities of the carrier hotel&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: Project Implementation (US$ 2.5 m)&#13;
&#13;
12. This activity will provide support needed to strengthen the capacity of the Government to&#13;
implement the connectivity project, including setting up the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)&#13;
and hiring dedicated staff to work on the project, hiring experienced Procurement and Financial&#13;
Management specialists and a Project Coordinator. The component will also cover support to the&#13;
SPV and PPP for the carrier hotel, through hiring a small team (2 engineers and project manager)&#13;
for the SPV and for the PPP. The component will cover office equipment including vehicles,&#13;
incremental operating costs, audits, communications and environmental and social studies and&#13;
implementation of recommendations of the environmental studies.&#13;

                           Project Name: WARCIP APL2 - Togo&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I. Project administration mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
1. The proposed project will be implemented under the aegis of the MPT. Implementation&#13;
arrangements as shown in the graph below involve using 5 Focal Units. The PIU will be headed&#13;
by the Project Coordinator who will report directly to the Minister. The PIU will be composed of&#13;
(i) a project coordinator, (ii) a Procurement specialist, (iii) an FM specialist, (iv) an M&amp;E&#13;
Specialist, (v) a Telecom Expert and (vi) Support staff.&#13;
&#13;
2. Hiring of the PIU members and technical staff are underway under the PPA. A recruitment&#13;
firm is handling the process. The Recipient shall, not later than three months after the Effective&#13;
Date, employ the, monitoring and evaluation specialist, and telecommunications specialist under&#13;
terms of reference and with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Association. The&#13;
PIU core team will be strengthened by contracting an environmental and social safeguards&#13;
consultant who will work closely with Agence Nationale de la Gestion Environnemtale (ANGE)&#13;
to ensure all Project activities comply with safeguard requirements as stipulated in the ESMF and&#13;
RPF.&#13;
&#13;
3. The PIU will serve as the Credit administrator of the project and will handle all&#13;
administrative matters in accordance with the PIM. It will also ensure financial management and&#13;
handle project disbursements, and include the preparation and submission of replenishment&#13;
requests to IDA. The Unit will also be responsible for (i) maintaining a Management&#13;
Information System (MIS) for tracking progress in all project subcomponents, both in terms of&#13;
financial performance and meeting implementation targets and monitor the performance of all&#13;
contractors under the project; (ii) preparing annual work programs and budgets, and if necessary,&#13;
reviewing, in consultation with IDA, the reallocation of resources across the various components&#13;
of the project as lessons emerge as to patterns of demand and development impact. Development&#13;
of the PIM and establishment of the MIS will be financed under the PPA.&#13;
&#13;
4. The PIU will be assisted by a task team composed of five focal units. The focal units will be&#13;
appointed by the Minister upon recommendation of different agencies/departments as follows:&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;·   Focal Unit recommended by the Minister on issues related to policy matters;&#13;
       ï&#130;·   Focal Unit designated by the regulatory authority on regulatory issues.&#13;
       ï&#130;·   Focal Unit from Ministry of Finance for public participation in PPP&#13;
       ï&#130;·   Focal Unit from the Ministry of Public works for follow up on construction of the&#13;
           carrier hotel&#13;
       ï&#130;·   Focal Unit from representatives of telecommunications operators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               28&#13;
&amp;#12;5. Dedicated teams will be assigned for large activities. In the case of the carrier Hotel, the&#13;
project will assist the Government to hire a team of three consultants to work closely with the&#13;
consultants for the carrier hotel and will be associated with every step of the process from&#13;
conception to construction to gain technical knowledge. The team could be considered for&#13;
recruitment by the Government or the SPV after their contract under the project comes to an end.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
7. The main strength is the existing of a PPF which will finance (i) the creating of the PIU, (ii)&#13;
the drafting of the Project implementation Manual including acceptable Financial and&#13;
Accounting Manual, (iii) and the set-up of computerized accounting system. It is important that&#13;
the PIU be fully established with a good draft of the operational manual in place, before&#13;
effectiveness, since any delay can have an adverse impact on implementation.&#13;

Designated account&#13;
&#13;
10. One designated Account will be opened at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The&#13;
ceiling of the DA has been set to CFAF 500 million based on the disbursement forecast for the&#13;
first four months. The project coordinator and the FM specialist will be the signatories of the&#13;
designated account.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement methods and processes&#13;
&#13;
11. Disbursements under the project would be transaction based. In addition making advances to&#13;
the Designated Account, other disbursement methods (reimbursement, direct payment and&#13;
special commitment) will be available for use under the project, for example, direct,&#13;
reimbursement, and special commitment methods. Further instructions on disbursement and&#13;
details on the operations of the Withdrawal Applications and Direct Payments will be outlined in&#13;

&amp;#12;Reporting and Auditing arrangements&#13;
&#13;
14. Quarterly Interim Un-audited Financial Reports (IFRs) will be prepared by the FM specialist.&#13;
IFRs included specific information on IDA financing will be submitted to the Bank within 45&#13;
days following the end of each quarter.&#13;
&#13;
15. The PIU will produce Annual Financial Statements for the Project which will comply with&#13;
the local accounting standards (SYSCOHADA).&#13;
&#13;
Audit arrangements&#13;
&#13;
External audit&#13;
&#13;
16. The supreme audit institution (Cour des Comptes) which is supposed to audit all public funds&#13;
is being established and has a limited capacity in terms of staffing and experience of auditing&#13;
project financial statements. In view of this, an external independent and qualified private sector&#13;
auditor acceptable to the World Bank will be recruited under the supervision of the steering&#13;
committee put in place by Togo ministry of finance for public company external audit.&#13;
&#13;
17. The Auditor will express an opinion on the Annual Financial Statements, and perform his&#13;
audit in compliance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). He will be required to&#13;
prepare a Management Letter detailing his observations and comments, providing&#13;
recommendations for improvements in the accounting system and the internal control&#13;
environment. The audit report on the annual project financial statements and activities of the DA&#13;
will be submitted to IDA within six months after the end of each project fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
FM implementation Support&#13;
&#13;
18. The project will be supervised on a risk-based approach. Supervision will focus on the status&#13;
of financial management system to verify whether the system continues to operate well and&#13;
provide support where needed. It will comprise inter alia, the review of audit reports and IFRs,&#13;
advice to task team on all FM issues, review of annual audited financial statements and&#13;
management letters. Based on the current risk assessment which is Moderate, there will be one&#13;
on-site visit supervision per year during the implementation and a review of transactions will be&#13;
performed on this occasion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
    Based on the outcome of the FM risk assessment, the                   Frequency&#13;
    following implementation support plan is proposed. The&#13;
    objective of the implementation support plan is to ensure&#13;
    the project maintains a satisfactory financial management&#13;
    system throughout the projectâ&#128;&#153;s life.&#13;

&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
&#13;
19. Capacity Assessment, Risk and Mitigation Measures: A procurement capacity assessment&#13;
of the MPT has been conducted during project preparation on November 23, 2011. The potential&#13;
risks identified are the lack of experience and skills in relation to the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s procurement&#13;
procedures and the lack of a procurement manual. The procurement unit established under the&#13;
MPT is new and bears no qualified procurement staff. The mitigation measures agreed upon are&#13;
therefore to: (a) recruit a Procurement Officer; (b) Organized procurement training for staffs of&#13;
MPT involved in the project procurement process; (c) use procurement consultant to assist the&#13;
MPT for complex/specialized procurement; (d) nominate a project Procurement Officer within&#13;
the Ministryâ&#128;&#153;s Procurement Committee, and (e) prepare project procurement manual as part of&#13;
Project Implementation Manual. Taking into consideration the lack of capacity of the existing&#13;
procurement unit (CPMP) and internal procurement control committee (CCMP), the overall&#13;
project procurement risk has been rated as substantial.&#13;
&#13;
20. Guidelines: Procurement and employment of consultants under the proposed project will be&#13;
carried out in accordance with: (i) the Bank â&#128;&#156; Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works and&#13;
Non-consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowersâ&#128;? dated January 2011; (ii) Bankâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Guidelines: Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowersâ&#128;? â&#128;? dated&#13;
January 2011; (iii) the Bank â&#128;&#156;Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        36&#13;
&amp;#12; Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grantsâ&#128;?, dated October 15, 2006 and&#13;
revised in January 2011 (â&#128;&#156;Anti-Corruption Guidelinesâ&#128;?) and (iv) the provisions of the Financing&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
21. Procurement Documents: Procurement will be carried out using the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents or Standard Request for Proposal (RFP) for all International Competition&#13;
Bidding (ICB) for goods and for the selection of consultants, respectively. For National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB), the Recipient should submit a sample form of bidding documents&#13;
to the Bank for prior review and will continue to use this type of document throughout the&#13;
project once this has been agreed upon. The Sample Form of Evaluation Reports published by&#13;
the Bank will be used. In addition, no community preference will be applicable under NCB.&#13;
&#13;
22. Frequency of Procurement Reviews and Supervision: The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s prior and post reviews&#13;
will be carried out on the basis of thresholds indicated in the table below. The Bank will conduct&#13;
bi-annual supervision missions and annual Post Procurement Reviews (PPR); the ratio of post&#13;
reviews will be at least one out of five contracts. The Bank could also conduct an Independent&#13;
Procurement Review (IPR) at any time until two years after the closing date of the project.&#13;

25. Anti-Corruption Action Plan: The following measures will be carried out to mitigate&#13;
corruption risk:&#13;
&#13;
          ï&#130;·   Publication of Advertisements and Contracts: All publications of advertisements and&#13;
              contract awards, will be done in accordance with the Guidelines requirements and&#13;
              published through client connection system, on external websites, i.e. UNDB and&#13;
              dgMarket websites;&#13;
          ï&#130;·   Debarred Firms: Appropriate attention will be given to the need to ensure that&#13;
              debarred firms or individuals are not given opportunities to compete for Bank-&#13;
              financed contracts; and&#13;
          ï&#130;·   Complaints: All complaints by bidders will be diligently addressed and monitored in&#13;
              consultation with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
26. Procurement Filing. Procurement documents must be maintained in the project files and&#13;
archived in a safe place for at least two years after the closing date of the project. The Public&#13;
Procurement Committee of the relevant Ministry of the project, through the Procurement&#13;
Officers, will be responsible for the filing of procurement documents.&#13;
&#13;
C.        Environmental and Social safeguards&#13;
&#13;
27. The establishment of carrier hotel is not expected to have significant negative environmental&#13;
impact. The proposed project is rated as a Category B. The potential environmental and social&#13;
impacts are likely to be small-scale and site-specific and thus easily remediable and reversible.&#13;
&#13;
                                                              41&#13;
&amp;#12;The Environmental Safeguards Policies triggered are Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01),&#13;
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04), Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) and Involuntary&#13;
Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). As the exact nature and location of investments may not be&#13;
determined up front, the GoT prepared and consulted upon an Environmental and Social&#13;
Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).&#13;
&#13;
28. The proposed project is expected to have positive social benefits. The main social impacts of&#13;
the proposed project are the increased possibility of better access to ICT services for the&#13;
population and improved GoT service delivery. The project will contribute to (i) enabling ICT to&#13;
become a driver for sustainable economic growth; (ii) enabling the GoT to use ICT to improve&#13;
services; (iii) improving access and quality of ICT services for the general population,&#13;
businesses, and the GoT; and (iv)reducing isolation and enhance economic activities in rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
29. The Project will have limited negative environmental and social impacts. These are linked&#13;
building the carrier Hotel that could lead to: soil erosion (in dune areas); soil and water pollution;&#13;
loss of vegetation (tree felling); the disruption of life (waste from work), of socio-economic&#13;
activities and livelihoods located on the way (workshops, garages, shops, etc.); disturbance of&#13;
traffic; noise; dust; risk of accident and the generation of waste; but also the risk of vandalism&#13;
and social frustration when local workforce is not used as well as risks of accidents during the&#13;
works. A summary of the risks is available in the table below. The ESMF outlines: (i) mitigation&#13;
of impacts, (ii) collaboration between WARCIP PIU and Agence Nationale de Gestion de&#13;
lâ&#128;&#153;Environnement ANGE (iii) strengthening PIU team by hiring environmental and social&#13;
specialists (iv) information to stakeholders involved in the implementation of the project and&#13;
public awareness; (v) a program of surveillance and monitoring; (vi) Institutional responsibilities&#13;
for environmental monitoring; (vii) the institutional arrangements for implementing the ESMF,&#13;
(ix) the recommendations for implementation; (x) the timing for the implementation of measures&#13;
and the Costs of environmental and social measures. Based on the outcomes of the screening&#13;
process, the requirement to carry out an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)&#13;
that includes an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) will be undertaken during&#13;
project implementation in parallel with technical feasibility studies of Project subcomponents.&#13;
&#13;
30. The Project impacts on cultural property are limited. The terrestrial fiber optic links will be&#13;
built with the right-way of existing roads or railways and the IXP/Carrier Hotel/Datacenter will&#13;
be built on an existing technical site; therefore it is not expected to pose risks of damaging&#13;
existing community cultural property. Nevertheless, proposed subcomponents will be screened&#13;
for their potential impacts on cultural property and chance find procedures will be applied and&#13;
appropriate mitigation measures for both the identification and protection of cultural property.&#13;
The ESMF has provided the systematic steps to be followed once these properties are discovered&#13;
during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
31. The Project design has considered avoiding any impacts to natural habitat. The proposed&#13;
activities under this operation should not cross natural parks or reserves. However, the project&#13;
includes special arrangements for sensitive sites (wetlands and critical natural habitats). If the&#13;
works will result any pressures on natural ecosystems, fauna and flora, the ESMF has&#13;
recommended step to be followed during ESIA preparation in addition to avoiding these sites.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 42&#13;
&amp;#12;32. The Project design has considered avoiding any displacement of persons. The need for&#13;
involuntary resettlement resulting from land acquisition in specific subcomponents area will only&#13;
be known during project implementation when site-specific plans are available. The prepared&#13;
RPF includes guidance for preparing socio-economic surveys, a census of people and assets, and&#13;
appropriate eligibility and entitlement frameworks. Therefore, subcomponents will be screened&#13;
for application of the involuntary resettlement policy (OP 4.12) and any subcomponents&#13;
involving involuntary resettlement or land acquisition will only be approved (and disbursed&#13;
against) after preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) acceptable to the Bank. The RPF&#13;
has considered procedures for identifying eligible project-affected individuals, calculating and&#13;
delivering compensation, and determining mechanisms for land dispute grievance redress as well&#13;
as mechanisms for adequately monitoring and evaluating the level of compliance.&#13;
&#13;
33. For Togo, the total cost of activities is estimated at US$ 406,000. While Credit funds will not&#13;
finance land acquisition, the Credit may finance certain eligible Resettlement Costs to compensate&#13;
for the temporary or permanent disruption of the living environment, socio-economic activities and&#13;
livelihoods. The ESMF and RPF were reviewed and cleared by the Bank on March 18, 2013 and&#13;
disclosed in the in country and at the Infoshop on March 19 and March 20, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
34. Institutional arrangements for implementation and monitoring: WARCIP Togo PIU will be&#13;
strengthened by hiring an environmental and social safeguards consultant (part time) who will&#13;
work closely with Agence Nationale de la Gestion Environnementale (ANGE). This&#13;
environmental and social focal point (SEFP) responsible for following up on safeguards concerns&#13;
to ensure that all subcomponents identified for operation financing have included consistent and&#13;
coherent environmental and social measures and are responsible for applying the safeguard&#13;
screening and mitigation requirements to each subproject. Both the Environmental and Social&#13;
Management and the Monitoring specialists of the project will be ensured by consulting firms&#13;
(preparation of technical files) and control firms (monitoring of work) to be recruited by the&#13;
National Coordination of the WARCIP Project, under the supervision of ANGE that will be&#13;
supported under the project for this purpose. These firms should have environmental and social&#13;
experts to effectively cover these aspects during (i) the preparation of technical documents and&#13;
(ii) the monitoring of the works.&#13;

&amp;#12;D.    Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
35. An M&amp;E system will be set up within the PIU to keep track of and evaluate implementation&#13;
progress of the proposed IDA project within the broader context of the institutional framework&#13;
for the telecommunications sector. Although increased geographical reach and reduction of&#13;
costs at the country level remains the hallmark of success of an enabling environment, the&#13;
projectâ&#128;&#153;s M&amp;E system will seek first to measure results that are closely associated with project&#13;
activities. Hence, the first order of indicators that the M&amp;E system will look at shall include&#13;
lower indicators related to quality, quantity, and time. Ultimately, improvement of laws and&#13;
decrees by the project activities will have positive ripple effects on the whole sector and on&#13;
service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
36. The views of direct beneficiaries will be brought into the monitoring and evaluation process.&#13;
Comprehensive M&amp;E reporting will be needed to monitor the results and performance of the&#13;
project. It will involve mainly the direct beneficiaries of project activities, but will be extended&#13;
to other beneficiaries such as telecommunications operators and private ICT firms, which&#13;
ultimately are the main beneficiaries of the projectâ&#128;&#153;s outcomes. The PIUs will review and&#13;
validate the reports on performance indicators and recommend corrective action if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
E.    Role of Partners&#13;
&#13;
37. The World Bank is the main development partner working on the ICT sector in Togo. Other&#13;
partners include the African Development Bank, ITU and ECOWAS. The Ministry is discussing&#13;
with the African Development Bank possible financing for the construction and/or&#13;
strengthening of national connectivity and for e-government applications. The ITU and&#13;
ECOWAS are providing significant support in the areas of capacity building for the regulatory&#13;
Authority. The project main actors will coordinate with the development partners involved in&#13;
the sector to ensure complementarity of the different interventions.&#13;

1. Resources under the PPA are expected to ensure that the policy, regulatory, environmental and&#13;
social safeguards, as well as requisite capacity are in place before Board. The PPA is also expected&#13;
to ensure that the Government has the requisite Transaction, Legal and Regulatory experts to&#13;
ensure open access, effective structuring of PPPs to own and manage communications&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
2. The strategic partnerships and collaboration, combined with active client engagement and&#13;
upfront preparatory work, are expected to facilitate achievement of the PDO. Furthermore the&#13;
team has conducted preliminary assessments of the institutions expected to execute the Program&#13;
to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiduciary obligations.&#13;

&#13;
4. The Bank team members will be based either in Washington DC or in the Africa region, and&#13;
will be available to provide timely, efficient and effective implementation support to the client.&#13;
Formal supervision and field visits will be carried out semi-annually initially, with possibility for&#13;
annual visits in later years of the project. Detailed inputs from the Bank team are outlined below:&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·     Technical inputs. Technical telecommunications and regulatory related inputs are required&#13;
         to review bid documents to ensure fair competition through proper technical&#13;
         specifications and fair assessment of the technical aspects of bids. ICT Policy Specialists&#13;
         and regulatory specialists will provide technical support and conduct supervision visits&#13;
         whenever needed. The team will liaise with the legal department to support with the&#13;
         review on PPP instruments, licenses and corporate/contractual documents developed&#13;
         under the project.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 50&#13;
&amp;#12;   ï&#130;·   Fiduciary requirements and inputs. Training will be provided by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financial&#13;
       management specialist and procurement specialist before the commencement of project&#13;
       implementation as needed. The team will also help identify capacity building needs to&#13;
       strengthen its financial management capacity and to improve procurement management&#13;
       efficiency. Both the financial management and the procurement specialist will be based&#13;
       in the region to provide timely support. Formal supervision of financial management will&#13;
       be carried out semi-annually or annually, while procurement supervision will be carried&#13;
       out on a timely basis as required by the client.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Safeguards. Inputs from an environment specialist and a social specialist will be&#13;
       required, though the projectâ&#128;&#153;s social and environmental impacts are limited and client&#13;
       capacity is generally adequate. No field visits are likely to be required, but this will be&#13;
       confirmed - the social and environmental specialists will be available on a need basis.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Operation. The Task Team will also provide day to day supervision of all operational&#13;
       aspects, as well as coordination with the client and among Bank team members.&#13;

                            Project Name: WARCIP APL2 - Togo&#13;
&#13;
1. Open and non-discriminatory access to international capacity is needed to meet existing&#13;
and future demand for reliable and affordable capacity. Togo is currently dependent on a&#13;
single submarine cable â&#128;&#147; WACS - for its international capacity requirements. Currently this&#13;
capacity is owned and managed exclusively by Togo Telecom without open access principles. A&#13;
PPP framework to allow other operators to have access to capacity on open and non-&#13;
discriminatory terms is key for the development of the broadband market in Togo.&#13;
&#13;
2. Creation of a PPP for construction of a carrier hotel/IXP is the most cost-effective long-&#13;
term solution for addressing Togo's future communication infrastructure needs . Through&#13;
Togo Telecom's investment in WACS, its national backbone and cross border connections, the&#13;
country has a potentially cost-effective national and international infrastructure in place, however&#13;
as a monopoly, Togo Telecom has no incentive lower prices and the benefits of the investment&#13;
for the country will not be fully realised unless capacity is available to all operators on an open&#13;
access basis. In addition, if priced competitively, the carrier hotel facilities would provide&#13;
important alternative international routes in the region - for landlocked Burkina Faso in&#13;
particular, but also potentially as a backup route for Benin and Niger. Once capacity is made&#13;
available at competitive prices the capacity in use is expected to increase dramatically due to the&#13;
much lower pricing that can be achieved. High capacity international connectivity will mitigate&#13;
the existing technological marginalization of Togo and bridge the digital divide by expediting&#13;
broadband rollout, e-Government and e-Services, new media and ICT development in urban and&#13;
rural Togo, for the benefit of the public. Specific steps would need to be taken, however, in&#13;
particular to establish a clear regulatory regime for the landing point, in order to ensure that Togo&#13;
fully benefits from the potential connectivity that the cable offers.&#13;
&#13;
3. Benefits of Carrier Hotel investment: lower costs and improved reliability in accessing&#13;
national and international online services. For Togo, the key ICT infrastructure need is to&#13;
ensure the presence of infrastructure that can provide the whole population with low cost reliable&#13;
connectivity, both internationally and domestically. In addition the proposed carrier hotel will&#13;
create the incentive for cross-border connections and local hosting which will provide domestic&#13;
backup and secure alternate international routes via Ghana and Benin, which have 6 different&#13;
submarine cable landings between them. Aside from improving reliability, this also provides&#13;
competitive alternative routes to WACS, ensuring that domestic prices for international capacity&#13;
are kept low. This will give Togo a highly reliable and much more affordable service which will&#13;
also see demand from across the nation's borders. If capacity is reliable and reasonably priced,&#13;
Burkina Faso and Niger are likely to purchase capacity. While these countries all have other&#13;
neighbours from which to obtain international capacity, most of them will be likely route at least&#13;
20-30% of their traffic via Togo to maintain their restoration links. Given that world-wide,&#13;
demand for affordable bandwidth continues to exceed supply, and that Burkina Faso, Niger and&#13;
Benin are also likely to require alternate sources of international capacity that could be delivered&#13;
via Togo, there is very little likelihood of the capacity made available being under-used, as long&#13;
as the national backbone and Carrier Hotel/IXP can deliver the wholesale bandwidth at a&#13;
competitive price and where it is needed.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 53&#13;
&amp;#12;4. Carrier Hotels use well-proven technologies and business models, and involve no&#13;
appreciable technology and little economic risk. The Carrier Hotel and IXP would be designed&#13;
according to the latest standards. Therefore the project provides a smooth upgrade path for&#13;
increasing the capacity available to the same levels as elsewhere in the world. Establishing the&#13;
PPP and enabling policy and regulatory environment could lead to some initial delays, but given&#13;
the high priority that government is giving to ICT development, it is expected that every effort&#13;
will be made to ensure the Carrier Hotel/IXP is operational as soon as possible.&#13;
&#13;
5. The proposed project recognizes that infrastructure and policy environment bottlenecks&#13;
need to be dismantled to ensure better communications access. Technical design of the&#13;
project reflects lessons learned in the ICT sector and international best practices . For most&#13;
developing countries, a major obstacle to the uptake of ICT remains the lack of adequate access&#13;
to ICT infrastructure. A lack of investment in ICT infrastructure and access networks, coupled&#13;
with inefficient provision of services, are the most important factors undermining the&#13;
development of networked economies. The main lesson derived is that success is mainly market&#13;
driven. Creating a predictable legal and policy environment leading to effective competition in&#13;
the sector is key to improving investor confidence and restoring trust in the ICT sector. The focus&#13;
of the proposed project is to create a PPP framework for international connectivity. The project&#13;
will establish an enabling institutional and regulatory environment to help attract and sustain&#13;
investment in the telecommunications sector in granting open access to connectivity for existing&#13;
and future competitors of Togo Telecom.&#13;
&#13;
6. Fiber cable has an advantage over alternatives in terms of price and quality of service.&#13;
Satellite is not an option, as it is more expensive than cross-border capacity purchase, and&#13;
satellite also suffers from lower quality of service than fiber. While it is possible to circumvent&#13;
these problems to some extent through use of sophisticated traffic shaping devices at each end of&#13;
the link, this creates additional capital and human resource costs for the user. A new type of&#13;
satellite service that is based on 'medium earth orbit' satellites (MEOs), which provides lower&#13;
levels of latency due to their greater proximity to earth, could meet needs for improved&#13;
international connectivity. However, the only proposed service of this type, called 03B, has yet to&#13;
launch any satellites and is still much more costly when compared to the fiber options, so it was&#13;
also eliminated from further consideration as a national solution, although in the future in some&#13;
remote areas it may have value for providing localised connectivity where there is no fiber.&#13;
&#13;
7. Assumptions of financial analysis. Financial comparisons of the options were made using&#13;
the following assumptions:&#13;
&#13;
                     ï&#130;·   Capacity purchase of 1 STM-16 to Europe from a neighbouring country on a&#13;
                         15-year IRU basis.&#13;
                     ï&#130;·   Carrier Hotel and IXP establishment will cost USD $4.98 million23&#13;
                     ï&#130;·   Annual operating and maintenance costs: 3% of CAPEX for IRU and 6% for&#13;
                         carrier hotel&#13;
                     ï&#130;·   A discount rate of 15% on financing&#13;
                     ï&#130;·   Study Period: 10 years, commencing in 2013&#13;
&#13;
23&#13;
     The cost covers the building plus the equipment&#13;
&#13;
                                                       54&#13;
&amp;#12;                  ï&#130;·    Revenues from the project begin in 2014&#13;
                  ï&#130;·    For international traffic, operators competing with Togo Telecom will&#13;
                       purchase 5% of the international capacity required in 2014, rising to 25% over&#13;
                       the study period. Countries in the region (Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso)&#13;
                       purchase 10% of their capacity needs from Togo, rising to 20% over the study&#13;
                       period) for security/restoration purposes.&#13;
                  ï&#130;·    Annual broadband subscriber growth is 50% in year one, declining to 10%&#13;
                       over the study period24&#13;
                  ï&#130;·    A wholesale capacity price of $100 to 200/Mbps/month dropping to USD&#13;
                       $100-50/Mbps/month over the study period. Associated rack space rental&#13;
                       revenues are based on market prices in the region.&#13;
                  ï&#130;·    An average international traffic per subscriber rising from 25Kbps to 60Kbps&#13;
                       over the study period.&#13;
&#13;
8. Depending on the revenue model and capacity pricing adopted the investment capacity&#13;
and the Carrier Hotel in Togo will breakeven between 2017 and 2019, after which the&#13;
project will be cash-flow positive if wholesale pricing levels are maintained. The investment&#13;
will see Togo breakeven by 2019, depending on the wholesale price adopted, with an NPV to&#13;
2023 of US$8.49 million and an IRR of 26.57%, (assuming an average wholesale bandwidth sale&#13;
price of US$200/Mbps/month, declining to US$100 in year 5), and an NPV of US$958 600 with&#13;
an of IRR of 16.32%, assuming US$100/Mbps/month initially, declining to US$50 wholesale&#13;
price in year 5. For Togo, pricing capacity for traffic in the US$100-200/Mbps/month range is&#13;
likely to be sustainable and would stimulate use. This also takes into account bandwidth pricing&#13;
trends in other regions such as East Africa. The final break-even year will depend on actual&#13;
capacity uptake and the wholesale price of bandwidth. After 2019 at the latest, the project would&#13;
be cash-flow positive and substantial revenues would be made if these wholesale pricing levels&#13;
are maintained.&#13;
&#13;
9. Previous experience with fiber cables shows a rapid increase in demand when price of&#13;
bandwidth decreases and availability increases. Lowering the cost of access has a strong&#13;
impact on the amount of bandwidth sold. This can be modelled using a price elasticity curve.&#13;
SAT-3 pricing, for which the most data is available, has show a clear relationship between&#13;
volume and tariffs. The chart below compares the price of access on SAT-3 (per E1 half-circuit to&#13;
Sessimbra, Portugal) against the volume of international bandwidth sold. This shows the effect&#13;
that price decreases between 2004 and 2006 had on the volume of bandwidth sold in each of four&#13;
countries where comparable data was available. The increase in international bandwidth demand&#13;
increases because broadband services first become more viable for operators to deploy, and&#13;
secondly because as retail prices decrease, the service becomes increasingly affordable and&#13;
penetration increases. RÃ©union is included here as a particularly clear case which shows that&#13;
when price was US$20,466 per Mb the volume was just 4 Mbps, but when it decreased to&#13;
US$1,967 volume increased to 180 Mbps. This increase comes about because of the multiplier&#13;
&#13;
24   This is probably conservative given the pentup demand and the trends elsewhere in more mature markets which&#13;
     are still growing at 70% or more. For example in Morocco, the total number of internet subscribers increased by&#13;
     70% year-on-year to end 2011, reaching 3.2m (10% of the population). Internet access via 3G represented 81%&#13;
     of the market, with the remaining 19% from ADSL connections.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;effects: monthly prices for broadband decrease, in turn improving affordability and increasing&#13;
uptake of services. Although pricing information has not been tracked in Kenya, the chart further&#13;
below also reinforces this picture, showing the extremely rapid growth in international capacity&#13;
used following the arrival of competing submarine cables in Mombasa which reduced the&#13;
wholesale price of capacity by a factor of over 10.&#13;

10. The Carrier Hotel (and IXP) will create improved connectivity by allowing the&#13;
different operators to have alternative and additional access beyond WACS. Carriers with&#13;
international infrastructure are expected to connect with the Carrier Hotel to provide services to&#13;
other operators/large users and also to ensure the security and redundancy of their own links by&#13;
having a single point from which to cross-connect. The presence of the Carrier Hotel would also&#13;
attract other international operators (as well as content providers) to land their fibre infrastructure&#13;
and data servers there, as the most cost effective place to meet, peer, and trade capacity. This&#13;
passive infrastructure reduces the cost for the local operators to connect to international&#13;
infrastructure by just having one place to connect with, and creates a more fluid open market for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 56&#13;
&amp;#12;capacity, because customers can switch between suppliers in seconds, (or change the volume of&#13;
capacity obtained from each of their suppliers) simply through a configuration change on the&#13;
router or changing a cross-connect cable on the fibre switchboard.&#13;
&#13;
11. The predicted international bandwidth demand for Togo is expected to be over 42Gbps&#13;
by 2023, but this assumes a competitively priced and pervasive national fibre backbone, an&#13;
enabling policy and regulatory environment for new market players and the availability of&#13;
sufficient radio spectrum. To be able to serve the public outside Lome effectively it will be&#13;
necessary to ensure that all operators can interconnect their base stations with competitively&#13;
priced fibre and that new operators are allowed to enter the market to compete with Togo&#13;
Telecom. In addition, given world-wide trends in broadband adoption levels, and particularly the&#13;
potential created by the explosion of wireless broadband25 (3G/4G/LTE/WiMax/WiFi), the&#13;
traffic estimates used in the analysis are relatively conservative, especially toward the end of the&#13;
analysis period, by which time it is expected that almost every mobile phone user would have&#13;
access to broadband on their handset26 and the majority of residences will have a wireless or&#13;
ADSL triple-play set-top box (voice telephony, Internet and IP-TV). However, this also requires&#13;
the availability of sufficient radio spectrum in the needed wavebands, otherwise the operators&#13;
may not be encouraged to introduce low cost services in the near future. The most desirable&#13;
wavebands are currently used by analog TV and until migration to digital TV takes place,&#13;
efficient use of spectrum will be likely to depend on the use of the latest radio protocols (IEEE&#13;
802.22) which uses white spaces in the TV frequency spectrum27 to bring broadband access to&#13;
hard-to-reach, low population density areas, typical of rural environments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25 3G data service uptake from the consumer has been massive and unprecedented in other developing countries&#13;
where competitively priced services have become available, and in most of these countries the majority of Internet&#13;
access now takes place via the mobile networks.&#13;
26 New 3G capable smartphones are now being sold in Africa for $75-100 (without contract or network locking),&#13;
andpricesareexpectedtocomedownmuchfurtheroverthenext10years.&#13;
27 The IEEE 802.22 WRAN standard is aimed at using cognitive radio (CR) techniques to allow sharing of&#13;
    geographically unused spectrum allocated to the Television Broadcast Service, on a non-interfering basis.&#13;

12. Capacity requirements have the potential to continue to advance rapidly as prices&#13;
drop, access device affordability improves, ICT literacy increases and more relevant local&#13;
applications are developed. Due to pent up demand, extrapolating trends in current broadband&#13;
subscriber growth will tend to under-estimate the future broadband user-base, and there are&#13;
similar considerations regarding extrapolating capacity requirements per user. Globally, the last&#13;
10 years has seen massive increases in end-user bandwidth demand resulting from the popularity&#13;
of social networks, image and video sites such as FaceBook and YouTube. Fortunately these&#13;
bandwidth demands have kept pace with technology developments, which are now seeing&#13;
domestic broadband services delivering 100Mbps and even 1Gbps in some advanced countries.&#13;
If Togo is to have the opportunity catch up, at least partially with these developments over the&#13;
next decade, then we can expect a relatively high level of growth in bandwidth use, perhaps&#13;
similar to Kenya where international traffic grew by over 25 times between 2008 and 2011. To&#13;
reflect this, the Togo analysis is based on an initial 25Kbps per subscriber of international&#13;
capacity rising to 60Kbps. Similarly, a 50% average annual subscriber growth is expected in the&#13;
years immediately following the availability of increased low cost capacity, to reach about 10%&#13;
&#13;
                                                    58&#13;
&amp;#12;average penetration by 202328. Consumer demand for high bandwidth multimedia services&#13;
delivery far overshadows business traffic, but the additional capacity required, especially for&#13;
mining, shipping, import/export services could generate significant Internet traffic. The&#13;
government's priorities to support human resource development, e-education and other advanced&#13;
use of ICTs as part of its ICT strategy are also expected to help grow bandwidth demand.&#13;
&#13;
13. Fast Internet has been shown to boost the productivity of firms as well as generate&#13;
employment opportunities. New growth theory suggests that long-run economic growth&#13;
emanates from the spill over arising from innovation and investment in new technologies. Fast&#13;
Internet access can be considered one important new technology, and broadband is increasingly&#13;
recognized to promote productivity and boost aggregate economic growth. Studies have shown&#13;
that firms using broadband (defined by the ITU as connection speeds above 256 Kbps) were on&#13;
average 10% more productive than firms using dial-up internet access. Faster internet speeds are&#13;
also causally related to increased employment opportunities with analysis showing that for every&#13;
one percentage point increase in broadband penetration within a region, employment increases&#13;
by 0.2-0% per year for the private, non-farm economy (Crandall et al, 2007). Indeed, studies&#13;
show a clear positive relationship between employment and broadband penetration in the&#13;
manufacturing and service industries, with business growth shown to be particularly significant&#13;
for larger businesses and for IT intensive sector (Lehr et al, 2006). The results of these studies&#13;
support the expectation that broadband penetration enhances economic activity. Increased&#13;
broadband speeds and less expensive data access have the potential to promote economic&#13;
activities in Togo, supporting the growth and productivity of businesses and gradual transfer of&#13;
employment from agricultural to service industries and expansion of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s nascent ICT&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
14. The project's delivery of increased access to Internet, will also have other positive&#13;
impacts, such as better education opportunities, improved public administration and&#13;
increased government revenues. The project will bring significant benefits to Togo in a&#13;
number of other ways including (i) increased public access to Internet services (ii) a broad range&#13;
of social benefits through increased labor productivity, learning opportunities for youth,&#13;
participation by women in the labor market, and improved public administration (iii) greater&#13;
fiscal returns due to new sources of revenue for the GoT. It must be noted, however, that the&#13;
economic and financial benefits of a technical assistance component are generally difficult to&#13;
quantify because of the inadequacy of data available at the outset.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28 A 10% penetration rate for broadband may seem low given the expected uptake in wireless smartphones over&#13;
   the coming years, but as observed by operators in North Africa and Europe, smartphone bandwidth-use is&#13;
   virtually insignificant compared to high-speed broadband usage of desktops, laptops and triple/double-play set-&#13;
   top boxes connected to either the fixed networks, or mobile networks using wireless modems. Thus the 10%&#13;
   population penetration figure may be more closely equated to a 50-70% household penetration level. Similarly&#13;
   the 60Kbps/user of international capacity requirement may appear small, but is verified by operator field data in&#13;
   more advanced economies, and is explained by: a) as markets mature a more significant amount of traffic is&#13;
   local rather than international, b) high bandwidth international traffic is cached locally (such as YouTube), c)&#13;
   60Kbps is the multiplexed capacity permanently allocated per subscriber, and since the user is not online 24hrs a&#13;
   day, this is the user's actual utilisation averaged over an entire day.&#13;

            The overall objective of the Second
            Phase of the West Africa Regional Communications
            Infrastructure Program Project for Africa is to support
            Togo's program of recovery from its long period of
            instability to promote growth and reduce poverty and will
            focus on three main objectives: a) deepening the economic
            recovery process and promoting sustainable development; b)
            supporting economic governance and transparency; and c)
            addressing urgent poverty reduction and social needs. The
            project has three main components with the ultimate aim
            being to enhance Togo's economic integration in the
            region. The first component of the project is supporting
            connectivity. The second component of the project is
            creating an enabling environment for connectivity. The third
            component of the project is project implementation,
            communications and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E).
