THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: Middle East &amp; North Africa&#13;
based on indicator sets that measure and benchmark&#13;
regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: High income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 9,445,624&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 43,480&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 31&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 32*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 74.33&#13;

can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the b ottom of the ranking on the&#13;

      the LLC must submit the following original documents to the&#13;
      Commercial Registry at the DED Trade License and Commercial&#13;
      Registration Department. These documents can also be submitted&#13;
      online due to the ongoing efforts by DED to render electronic&#13;
      registration available and convenient.&#13;
      - The prescribed application form, signed by the company manager(s)&#13;
      or their legal representative(s).&#13;
      - The memorandum of association (an original and a copy).&#13;
      - A letter issued by the DED, attesting to the company name approval.&#13;
      - The original letter of company approval, issued by the DED&#13;
      Committee of Limited Liability Companies.&#13;
      - Passport copy of each partner.&#13;
&#13;
      If Commercial Registry officials deem the documentation to be in order,&#13;
      the company name will be entered into the Commercial Register. The&#13;
      DED then forwards the following documents to the Federal Ministry of&#13;
      Economy to arrange for publication:&#13;
      - Notarized memorandum of association (copy).&#13;
      - The application for entry of the company name in the Commercial&#13;
      Register (copy).&#13;
      - Extract of the entry of the company name in the Commercial Register.&#13;
&#13;
      Publication takes several months. However, this time frame is not&#13;
      important because the authorities will accept a copy of the Ministry's&#13;
      receipt of publication fee payment. After the publication, the Ministry of&#13;
      Economy issues its approval letter.&#13;
&#13;
      Before the newly formed company can begin operations, it must apply&#13;
      to the DED for a trade license. After the notary public at the Commercial&#13;
      Registry notarizes the memorandum of association, a license&#13;
      application form is completed in Arabic, signed by the authorized&#13;
      company signatory and filed with the DED in duplicate. The DED files&#13;
      one copy and forwards the other to the UAE Federal Ministry of&#13;
      Economy.&#13;
      The trade license application must be filed with the applicable fee and&#13;
      the following documents:&#13;
      - The prescribed form for setting out the proposed company name in&#13;
      Arabic and English.&#13;
      - The original lease for the companyâ&#128;&#153;s office premises.&#13;
      - The prescribed form for obtaining the Dubai Municipality Building&#13;
      Departmentâ&#128;&#153;s clearance on the suitability of the office premises.&#13;
&#13;
      All business activities fall into three categories of licenses: (1)&#13;
      commercial licenses, covering all kinds of trading activity; (2)&#13;
      professional licenses, covering professions, services, craftsmen, and&#13;
      artisans; and (3) industrial licenses, establishing industrial or&#13;
      manufacturing activity.&#13;
&#13;
      Upon the conclusion of this procedure, the DED issues the original&#13;
      Trade License and Commercial Registration certificates. Upon&#13;
      presentation of the receipts showing payment of the Ministry&#13;
      publication fee and the Chamber of Commerce membership fee, the&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;

connection.&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Obtaining an electricity connection is essential to enable     ensure safety in the connection process while keeping&#13;
a business to conduct its most basic operations. In many       connection costs reasonable, governments around the&#13;
economies the connection process is complicated by the         world have worked to consolidate requirements for&#13;
multiple laws and regulations involvedâ&#128;&#148;covering service        obtaining an electricity connection. What reforms in&#13;
quality, general safety, technical standards, procurement      getting electricity has Doing Business recorded in United&#13;
practices and internal wiring installations. In an effort to   Arab Emirates (table 4.1)?&#13;

        Submit application to DEWA and await estimate&#13;
&#13;
        The customer is required to have their electrical works executed through&#13;
        an electrical contracting company. The trade license for carrying out&#13;
        electrical works in Dubai is issued to companies by the Department of&#13;
        Economic Development, Government of Dubai. The electrical contracting&#13;
        company would have electrical engineers and other technical staff&#13;
        working under their sponsorship. A private individual/engineer cannot&#13;
        obtain such trade license as a consultant company or contracting&#13;
        company or execute such works in Dubai. The consultant and&#13;
        contracting companies are to be enrolled with DEWA as per above&#13;
   1    criteria to be able to access the on-line services.                           7 calendar days            AED 0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The consultant is then given an account so they can apply online for and&#13;
        obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from DEWA, which is a step&#13;
        necessary to obtain the building permit. After the electrical consultant or&#13;
        contractor has obtained the NOC from DEWA, they will need to submit&#13;
        their electrical designs online for approval from DEWA. Based on&#13;
        whether the NOC determines the need for a substation, some additional&#13;
        approvals might be needed, such as for the substation location, size, and&#13;
        layout. For projects requiring a substation to be built within the plot, a&#13;
        consulting company will carry out the design works and obtain DEWA&#13;

      approval (Design approval) and further shop drawing approvals by the&#13;
      electrical contractor. For projects that do not require a substation, the&#13;
      electrical contracting company can directly prepare Shop Drawings and&#13;
      obtain approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Given that no substation is required in the assumed case, no additional&#13;
      approvals are recorded. The remaining approvals concern the wiring of&#13;
      the internal building and at the point of connection with DEWAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
      network, and as such are not recorded as separate procedures (it is&#13;
      assumed the electrician in charge of the internal wiring has already&#13;
      obtained these approvals).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      A list of approvals can be found at https://e-services.dewa.gov.ae. The&#13;
      approvals do not delay the process because they are obtained as part of&#13;
      the completion certificate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) introduced a 'One&#13;
      Window/ One Step Application for Getting Electricity' as the latest&#13;
      enhancement to its SAP System that went live in April 2012. The new&#13;
      system allows customers to submit their application and track it online. It&#13;
      will also allow them to follow the interactions between their electrical&#13;
      consultant/ contractor (who acts on their behalf) and the utility [by&#13;
      allowing this, customers will be able to track the status of their&#13;
      application, which will reduce any delays caused by the contractor].&#13;
      Technical site inspection can be scheduled online and no further&#13;
      interaction between the customer and the utility is needed. As such, the&#13;
      new electronic system will (1) improve the communication between the&#13;
      customer and their consultant/ contractor on one hand and the utility on&#13;
      the other, and (2) decrease time for processing of applications.&#13;
&#13;
      DEWA introduced a fixed unit-rate per kW for connection fees and&#13;
      reinforced a 7-day deadline to issue the connection fees after the&#13;
      application.&#13;

&#13;
      Processing for CAR permission from the concerned authorities are made&#13;
      immediately (by DEWA) after preparation of estimate and without&#13;
2     waiting for payment. DEWA can prepare a estimate of connection fees   25 calendar days     AED 35,000&#13;
      based on the approved drawings, the comments made in the NOC (the&#13;
      remarks indicate whether a substation is needed or not), and its&#13;
      Geographical Information System (GIS) that allows it to map the city,&#13;
      without the need to go on site.&#13;

&#13;
      The external works are concluded by one of DEWAâ&#128;&#153;s contractors. For 200&#13;
      Amps, the cable needed would be a 185 mm2 Al, 150 m. long.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      DEWA provides the meter and the cable, but charges only for the cable.&#13;
      The fee charged is equal to the cost for DEWA to lay out the cable (i.e.&#13;
      price of the cable and labor costs). The customer obtains and installs the&#13;
      rest of the material themselves (such as circuit breaker and meter&#13;
      cabinet).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      The customer requires executing the electrical works through an&#13;
      Electrical Contracting Company. The Trade License for carrying out&#13;
      electrical works in Dubai is issued to companies by the Department of&#13;
      Economic Development, Govt. of Dubai. The Electrical Contracting&#13;
      Company shall have electrical engineers and other technical staff&#13;
      working under their sponsorship. A private individual/engineer cannot&#13;
      obtain such Trade License as a Consultant Company or Contracting&#13;
      Company or execute such works in Dubai. The Consultant and&#13;
      Contracting companies are to be enrolled with DEWA as per the above&#13;
      criteria to approve access to the on-line E-services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      All works starting from NOC, Drawing approval, application registration,&#13;
      and issue of estimate, payment and up to installation of DEWA cable can&#13;
      be done in parallel and hence, do not cause delays.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      * Apply for and receive internal wiring inspection and obtain meter&#13;
      installation and final connection from DEWA&#13;
&#13;
      To request inspection of internal wiring, the electrical contractor has to&#13;
      apply online for an LV Inspection &amp; Release of Supply, and can also track&#13;
      the status of their application online. The approval can be obtained only&#13;
      if the electrician has previously obtained approval of the LV Shop&#13;
      Drawing. The application is free of charge. After submitting the online&#13;
      application, the electrical contractor will be asked to submit hard copies&#13;
      of the drawings, a site plan, and the NOC to the utility.                  7 calendar days     AED 1,911.6&#13;

      Staff from DEWA then check the internal wiring of the building (meter&#13;
      box, distribution board(s), etc.) to make sure it has been carried out&#13;
      according to the approved drawings. DEWA will install the meter and&#13;
      connect the warehouse to electricity upon successful inspection and&#13;
      submission by the contractor of all approvals and building completion&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;
when outages exceed a certain cap).                        companies and national regulators on SAIDI and SAIFI.&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

                             BizBank will then petition the court for an execution order. Mirage will be able to&#13;
                               respond to BizBankâ&#128;&#153;s claims and present its case before the execution order is&#13;
                              granted. This process will take up to 1 year. After BizBank obtains the execution&#13;
                             order, it will have to schedule another court date to enforce the execution order.&#13;

doing business ranking, which is based on the distance&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - United Arab Emirates
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for United
            Arab Emirates. To allow for useful comparison, the profile
            also provides data for other selected economies (comparator
            economies) for each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the
            13th edition in a series of annual reports measuring the
            regulations that enhance business activity and those that
            constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing
            business; for 2015 United Arab Emirates ranks 31. A high
            ease of doing business ranking means the regulatory
            environment is more conducive to the starting and operation
            of a local firm. Doing Business presents quantitative
            indicators on business regulations and the protection of
            property rights that can be compared across 189 economies
            from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business
            sheds light on how easy or difficult it is for a local
            entrepreneur to open and run a small to medium-size business
            when complying with relevant regulations. It measures and
            tracks changes in regulations affecting 11 areas in the life
            cycle of a business: starting a business, dealing with
            construction permits, getting electricity, registering
            property, getting credit, protecting minority investors,
            paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts,
            resolving insolvency and labor market regulation. The data
            in this report are current as of June 1, 2015 (except for
            the paying taxes indicators, which cover the period from
            January to December 2014).
