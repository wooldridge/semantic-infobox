   4. PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS AND SUCCESSES&#13;
&#13;
          ï&#131;&#152; Training of 36 Ministry of Education Science and Technology Key staff on inclusive&#13;
            education has promoted awareness among the staff members on mainstreaming issues&#13;
            pertaining to education of learners with disabilities in the education sector.&#13;
&#13;
          ï&#131;&#152; Clinical screening of 1009 children in the 30 schools has enabled the project to identify&#13;
            the rightful children with disabilities that need early intervention to increase their access&#13;
            to education in the inclusive schools. These include 111 Visual impairment, 40 Hearing&#13;
            Impairment , 95 Leaners with ear infection, 15 learners with Cerebral Palsy, 2 learners&#13;
            with Hydrocepphalus and 42 with physically Impairments.&#13;
&#13;
          ï&#131;&#152; Head teachers and School management committees from 30 schools in collaboration with&#13;
            their District Education Managers in Salima, Mchinji and Lilongwe have developed their&#13;
            own school improvement plans that will make their schools disability friendly which&#13;
            have been submitted to FEDOMA for approval.&#13;
&#13;
          ï&#131;&#152; 41 stakeholders from Disability Peoples Organisations, Ministries of Education, Health,&#13;
            Gender and Disability Affairs, and Nongovernmental Organisation have appreciated the&#13;
            need for Special Needs Education Data Information system from the Primary school,&#13;
            Zone, District, Division and National as a strategy to track the learning needs of children&#13;
            with Disabilities.&#13;
&amp;#12;      ï&#131;&#152; Ministry of Education has adopted the newly introduced SNE EMIS data analysis system&#13;
        for children with disabilities which will be piloted in the 30 targeted schools of Mchinji,&#13;
        Salima and Lilongwe.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#131;&#152; District Education Managers, Head teachers and mainstream teachers have been&#13;
        motivated to provide appropriate support to learners with disabilities through the&#13;
        Inclusive Education trainings conducted by the project team.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#131;&#152; Through the Planning Meeting the project team (project Manager &amp; District Coodinators)&#13;
        has unveiled various activities that will strengthen the implementation of Inclusive&#13;
        Education establishing active Action Learning Teams, Policy dialogue and lobbying for&#13;
        active volunteers to identify more children with disabilities who are out of school.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#131;&#152;    46 stakeholders from Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Gender and&#13;
          disability affairs, Non-Governmental Organisation, and Disability Organisations who&#13;
          participated in the dissemination of Needs Assessment for children with disabilities&#13;
          report have been influenced and motivated to be proactive in providing appropriate&#13;
          services to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities for an inclusive&#13;
          education agenda to be a success.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#131;&#152; The project team has acquired knowledge and new skills to serve the inclusive education&#13;
        project better through the inclusive education project training.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#131;&#152; Provision of the Building Contractors for the develop school improvement that make a&#13;
        disability friendly learning environment for learners with disabilities has energized the&#13;
        school management committees to support inclusive education.&#13;
&#13;
5. LESSONS LEARNT&#13;
&#13;
  Engagement of key staff in the Ministry of Education Science and Technology through training is&#13;
  a major tool for changing their mindset to promote inclusive education practices and provision of&#13;
  equitable access of educational services to children with disabilities at all levels of the education&#13;
  sector.&#13;
&#13;
  Early Clinical assessment for children with disabilities needs to be priority before providing&#13;
  educational services for children with disabilities.&#13;
&#13;
  Harnessing School Management committees to support learners with disabilities is essential in&#13;
  advocating for school improvement that makes the school environment friendly for learners with&#13;
  disabilities.&#13;
&#13;
  Some schools management committees are able to make their schools friendly to children with&#13;
  disabilities using school improvement grants from Government.&#13;
&#13;
  Key barrier for children with disabilities not staying in school is failure of classroom teachers to&#13;
  meet learning needs of children with disabilities in the classroom and making schools disability&#13;
  friendly.&#13;
&amp;#12;  Large numbers of children with disabilities are not benefitting from the available educational&#13;
  resources due to lack of awareness among service providers.&#13;
&#13;
  Learners with disabilities and other learners are able to support each other in the process of&#13;
  teaching and learning e.g. the case of Salima LEA and Malingunde F.P. School.&#13;
&#13;
  Promoting teaching of survival skills or vocational skills other than academic subjects only is&#13;
  essential for learners with severe learning disabilities as a strategy for inclusive education to&#13;
  benefit all children with disabilities.&#13;
&#13;
  Mainstream teachers are willing to support children with disabilities regardless of the class size&#13;
  and limited knowledge and skills of teaching children with disabilities.&#13;
&#13;
6. CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED IN THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Negative attitude by some key staff in the ministry of education who value children with&#13;
          disabilities as a minority group to benefit from educational resources.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Some learners with disabilities are travelling long distances from home to school which is&#13;
          a threat to their life.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Unfair and discriminatory preparation of examination for children with disabilities in the&#13;
          schools that supporting children with disabilities.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Unavailability of appropriate and effective assistive devices, teaching learning and&#13;
          assessment resources for children with disabilities in the school.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Some learners with disabilities are in school without learning due to large class sizes or in&#13;
          adequate mainstream class teachers.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Some district coordinators are unable to visit some schools due geographical and distance&#13;
          barriers e.g. Mchinji.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Some learners who are learning in junior primary schools have challenges to finish the&#13;
          primary school cycle (standards 1 to 8).&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Late submission of school improvement plans by school management committees and&#13;
          District Education Managers has delayed the process for identifying contractors to&#13;
          conduct the school improvement exercise.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Some parents were reluctant to send their children with disabilities for clinical assessment&#13;
          due to negative attitude and cultural beliefs.&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Some Inclusive education district coordinators have little classroom experience that&#13;
          makes it difficult for them to advise the mainstream teacher on good inclusive teaching&#13;
          practices.&#13;

            This report mainly covers inclusive
            education project activities that have been carried out in
            the months of June, July, and August 2015. The objective of
