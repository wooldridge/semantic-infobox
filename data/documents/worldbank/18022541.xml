Dear Mr. Tuwo:&#13;
Re: Amendment No. I to the Trust Fund Administration Agreement between the Millennium&#13;
Challenge Account - Indonesia and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
for the Support Facility for National Program for Community Empowerment (PSF) (TFO 70967)&#13;
1.    We refer to the Trust Fund Administration Agreement, dated April 24, 2013 between the&#13;
Millennium Challenge Account - Indonesia ("MCA-I" or the "Provider") and the International Bank&#13;
for Reconstruction and Development ("Bank"), acting as administrator of the Support Facility for&#13;
National Program for Community Empowerment ("PSF"). Capitalized terms used but not defined in&#13;
this amendment have the meanings given to them in the Administration Agreement.&#13;
2.     Pursuant to the meeting of the PSF Joint Management Committee on January 22, 2013&#13;
endorsing an extension of end of disbursement date, and recent discussion between the Bank and the&#13;
Provider, the Bank proposes to amend the Administration Agreement as set out in this Amendment&#13;
(the "Amendment").&#13;
3.     Section 8.2 of Annex 2 to the Administration Agreement is amended to reflect the extension&#13;
of the end disbursement date of the PSF to June 30, 2018 as set out below.&#13;
"8.    Disbursement. Cancellation; Refund&#13;
8.2.   It is expected that the Allocation funds will be fully disbursed by the Bank in&#13;
accordance with the provisions of this Trust Fund Administration Agreement by June 30,&#13;
2018. The Bank will only disburse Allocation funds for the purposes of this Trust Fund&#13;
Administration Agreement after such date with the written approval of the Provider."&#13;
5.     All other terms and conditions of the Administration Agreement remain unchanged.&#13;

6.     The Bank will disclose this Agreement and related information on this Trust Fund in&#13;
accordance with the World Bank Policy on Access to Information. By entering into this Agreement,&#13;
the Provider consents to disclosure of this Agreement and related information on this Trust Fund.&#13;
7.    We propose that this letter shall constitute an amendment to the Administration Agreement&#13;
between the Bank and the Provider. Please confirm your acceptance to the foregoing, on behalf of&#13;
the Provider, by signing and dating the two originals, retaining one original for your records and&#13;
returning the other original to the Bank. Upon receipt by the Bank of the original Amendment&#13;
countersigned by you, this Amendment will become effective as of the date of the countersignature.&#13;
