                I.       BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Country background&#13;
&#13;
1.      Large oil reserves and abundant natural and human resources enabled Iraq to&#13;
attain the status of a middle-income country in the 1970s. Income per capita rose to over&#13;
US$3,600 in the early 1980s. Just before the conflict in 2003, Iraq was a country in&#13;
distress, having experienced a marked fall in almost all human development indicators&#13;
(material poverty, health standards, life expectancy and literacy) over the past decade.&#13;
The command economy of the past 25 years left its undeletable mark on almost all its&#13;
economic sectors. A series of wars and international sanctions further deteriorated it's&#13;
the economy. Despite the country's rich resource endowment, Iraq's human development&#13;
indicators are now among the lowest in the region and the country has drifted drastically&#13;
from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In 2004, the population remains very&#13;
vulnerable, with almost a meltdown of the economy and impoverishment of large&#13;
sections of society.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Years of conflicts, misdirected resources, and the effects of Iraq's centralized&#13;
command economy have stifled economic growth and development, curtailing Iraq's&#13;
ability to invest in new infrastructure and maintain existing facilities, as well as its ability&#13;
to attract private sector investment, all of which are part of a necessary integrated&#13;
approach to post-conflict reconstruction. Indeed, Iraq faces today a number of&#13;
monumental development challenges. The future of Iraq cannot rely on oil only. The&#13;
private sector will need to play a key role not only for bringing, about a diversified,&#13;
market economy but also to generate new employment.&#13;
&#13;
3.      With low-income levels and high unemployment rates,' an immediate concem is&#13;
to create new jobs; fostering private enterprise is one key source of economic growth and&#13;
employment generation. However, in the present conflict environment in Iraq, developing&#13;
the private sector is not straight-forward; it faces many challenges including knowledge&#13;
market failures, inadequate infrastructure, weak institutions that are unable to facilitate&#13;
and foster investment and job creation, a volatile security situation, and low capacity in&#13;
the public and the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
' IMF, UN/World Bank Watching Briefs, and other Iraqi sources estimate Per Capita GDP at $.840 for the&#13;
year 2003. The official rate for unemployment is 28%, while some estimates place this number at 50% or&#13;
more.&#13;

&#13;
4.        Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, at the request of the international&#13;
community, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Group (UNDG)&#13;
worked closely to produce a Joint United Nations/World Bank Iraq Needs Assessment&#13;
(October 2003). The report estimated the total reconstruction needs, excluding oil and&#13;
security expenditures, at around US$32 billion, most of which will be channeled&#13;
bilaterally. Two Trust Funds were also set-up at the United Nations and the World Bank&#13;
to ensure swift, flexible, and coordinated donor financing for priority investments&#13;
identified in the Needs Assessment, for which about US$1 billion have been commnitted&#13;
for 2004/2005 (see Box 1 for details).&#13;

                        II.     BANK RATIONALE AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
         Bank Response&#13;
&#13;
5.       In January 2004, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors discussed an&#13;
Interim Strategy note of the World Bank Group for Iraq and authorized the Bank to                act as&#13;
administrator of the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (the "ITF' or "The Trust Fund"), which&#13;
was created jointly by the World Bank and other donors3.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The proposed Private Sector Development (PSD) I Project (the 'Project') is fully&#13;
consistent with the World Bank's Interim Strategy Note for Iraq, which emphasizes                   the&#13;
need for short-term employment generation, institutional capacity building, and rapid&#13;
rehabilitation of critical infrastructure as prerequisites for long-term sustainable recovery.&#13;
The proposed operation also supports the Govemment of Iraq's (GOI) objective to create&#13;
a dynamic private sector by improving the investment climate where private participation&#13;
can flourish, as outlined in the more recent National Development Strategy (October&#13;
2004).&#13;
&#13;
7.       It also fits with the Bank Group's PSD strategy, which is based on four&#13;
fundamental     pillars:  (i)  building a competitive environment                (through     policies,&#13;
institutions, and regulations to build a sustainable investment climate, including trade&#13;
facilitation); (ii) restructuring State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), including support to&#13;
SMEs (through IFC's support); (iii) building financial systems and infrastructure&#13;
(including restructuring the banking sector and developing the payments system and the&#13;
supervisory capacity of the Central Bank of Iraq); and (iv) building a framework for a&#13;
public private partnership to provide basic services.&#13;
&#13;
        Bank Strategic Approach&#13;
&#13;
8.      Indeed, this Project complements the Bank's interventions in other sectors,&#13;
namely health, education, and infrastructure, all of which are necessary to promote&#13;
sustainable economic recovery. It has its origins in the initial Joint UN/WB Needs&#13;
Assessments prepared for the first Donors Conference in Madrid, which stressed the&#13;
importance of job generation through the promotion of investment in productive sectors,&#13;
ideally beyond the oil industry. The Needs Assessment also identified,                 amongst other&#13;
elements, SOEs' (highly inefficient and overstaffed) current weight on the economy, and&#13;
the lack of strong public institutions that support the private sector and the lack of&#13;
functionality of a banking system as bottlenecks for PSD.&#13;
&#13;
9.      This conference was followed-up by a series of policy workshops in the period                of&#13;
February to July 2004 which generated a series of "Iraqi owned" and developed priorities&#13;
that are reflected in this project (see Box 2 for further details). These workshops,             which&#13;

 were highly interactive in format, identified three areas of high priorities for Iraq where&#13;
 the Bank can have a significant role, namely (i) investment climate reform, and&#13;
 subsequently (ii) payments system reform and (iii) telecommunications sectors reform.&#13;
&#13;
 10.       In that effect, the Bank's strategic choices of intervention at this stage in private&#13;
 sector development (i) reflect the sector needs and the priorities identified by the Iraqis,&#13;
 (ii) take into account other Bank Group activities as well as other donors' activities, while&#13;
 (iii) applying lessons learned from previous experiences in post-conflict situations, as&#13;
 outlined below for the areas of strategic interventions.&#13;

           Sector - specific Issues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 11.       Investment Climate Reform. Relative to the size of the Iraqi economy, the&#13;
 formal private sector is quite small. The oil-led state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector, a&#13;
 large agriculture sector, and the public sector, account for the majority of employment in&#13;
 the country. The private sector is characterized by very few large companies, a number&#13;
 of small-medium enterprises (SMEs) and a very large number of micro-enterprises. It is&#13;
 estimated that in excess of 90% of the over 100,000 enterprises fall within the last&#13;
 category. Most large enterprises are in the state sector.&#13;
&#13;
 12.       Moreover, small businesses in particular suffer from informational and knowledge&#13;
 market failure. The sanctions regime added to this failure. Businesses do not know how&#13;
 to seek investment funds or develop export markets.                   Therefore, support to the key&#13;
 institutions that address these failures and to the private sector itself is a key first step. It&#13;
 is hoped this will build a pipeline of activity that has the potential for follow-on activities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                           4&#13;

or can be combined with IFC activities in the near future (see box 3 for details).&#13;
Moreover this "pilot" type approach minimizes project risk.&#13;
&#13;
13.       However, discussions with the Government of Iraq have identified two&#13;
overriding constraints that impact the private sector, which this project will attempt to&#13;
address; volatile security conditions and pessimistic public opinion. In that regard,&#13;
industrial zones have the potential to address the security needs of private sector investors&#13;
and also resolve infrastructural, regulatory and planning constraints. Furthermore, a&#13;
public awareness campaign can address the fundamental question many Iraqis have on&#13;
the importance of private sector investment and the role of the State. Many Iraqis still&#13;
believe it is the Government's role to provide investment.&#13;

&#13;
15.       Payments and settlement system telecommunications infrastructure. A basic&#13;
function of the banking sector is to serve as the core provider of payments services for&#13;
financial transactions for govermment, businesses and households -- an essential pillar of&#13;
efficient and effective banking and financial sectors. In Iraq, a major constraint is the&#13;
outdated or non-existent technical infrastructure for payments systems, which leads to an&#13;
inordinate amount of time and effort required to settle payments through the banking&#13;
system.     This constitutes an impediment to the efficient settlement of basic financial&#13;
transactions and thus the financial sector's ability to offer modern banking services and&#13;
products. It is also an impediment to private sector responsiveness and competitiveness&#13;
and to savings mobilization.&#13;
&#13;
16.        The Government and the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) are therefore giving high&#13;
priority to the development of a modern payments system that will enable the rapid,&#13;
secure and effective processing of both large-value and low-value transactions, consistent&#13;
with the principles advocated by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems&#13;
(CPSS) of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).                     The payments system is&#13;
expected eventually to comprise of: (i) an interbank payments system, based on a Real&#13;
Time Gross Settlements System (RTGS), including related information systems; (ii) an&#13;
automatic clearing house for low value transactions (including checks, cards and other&#13;
instruments); and (iii) secure and reliable telecommunications infrastructure of adequate&#13;
capacity to support a modern payments system.&#13;
&#13;
17.       In this regard, the US Government and other donors and institutions are planning&#13;
to provide substantial support for the RTGS system and clearing house, while this project&#13;
would provide early support for the development of high priority telecommunications&#13;
infrastructure with adequate bandwidth capacity to network the headquarters of CBI, the&#13;
CBI branches in Mosul and Basra, the two Government owned banks, Rafidain and&#13;
Rasheed, and the headquarters of about 20 private banks in Baghdad.&#13;
&#13;
18.       Telecommunications Sector.              The current telecommunication infrastructure is&#13;
characterized by limited availability of transmission capacity and lack of reliability,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          6&#13;

&#13;
especially     in the     areas    of high      speed     and    secure     commercial      lines.  Low&#13;
telecommunications penetration, old          technology and small backbone data transmission&#13;
capacity mean Iraq's telecommunications             does not meet the needs of a modem private&#13;
sector led economy. Iraq currently has an          average of 4 fixed telephones per 100 people,       3&#13;
mobile phones per 100 people, and 3 Intemet              connections per 1000 people4. The rural&#13;
penetration of telecommunication services             in Iraq is low; around 1 percent. There         is&#13;
limited capacity to provide leased lines and        transmission capacity needed by corporations&#13;
and new service providers. The fiber optic         network is limited and has no back-up support.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Fixed telephony and data communications               are currently provided by the Iraqi&#13;
Telecommunications and Post Company               (ITPC) - the incumbent, state-owned operator.&#13;
ITPC, a state owned enterprise is currently              over-staffed, with a total workforce of&#13;
approximately 18,100 of permanent staff             and about 4,000 temporary staff. There are&#13;
more than 14 employees for every 1,000 telephones             in Iraq. This number is more than the&#13;
regional average. Moreover, this work force            has little exposure to modem technologies&#13;
and commercial management. Though,                it is true that ITPC has great potential to        be&#13;
profitable, its present financial performance           is poor. It's profitability is impacted      by&#13;
several factors including:&#13;
&#13;
    o Its operating expenditure is high due to          overstaffing;&#13;
    o Its revenue is low due to poor collection          and low tariffs for local services;&#13;
    o ITPC cannot adequately service corporate               clients, who are potentially the most&#13;
        profitable. It has limited ability to provide        leased lines and transmission capacity&#13;
        needed by corporations and new service           providers; and,&#13;
    o It's not permitted to compete with             new entrants in the highly lucrative mobile&#13;
        services.&#13;
&#13;
20.     There are a number of actions underway              to address the challenges enumerated&#13;
above by restructuring the ITPC:&#13;
&#13;
    O ITPC is exploring areas to involve the           private sector in its operation;&#13;
    o ITPC is focusing on emerging areas for             revenue generation including termination&#13;
        of intemational calls and interconnecting         with mobile operators;&#13;
    o ITPC has secured limited funding from               the US and Japan to focus on switching&#13;
        and transmission networks;&#13;
    o   USAID has committed resources and consultancy                    services to restructure the&#13;
        company; and&#13;
    o World Bank will provide technical               assistance to support ITPC's restructuring&#13;
        under the capacity building project.&#13;
&#13;
21.     The telecommunications backbone infrastructure,                developed jointly with Iraqi&#13;
funds as well as Japanese bilateral assistance,        is key to ensuring the viability of ITPC       (a&#13;
major SOE), developing modem and                   competitive telecommunications sector,           and&#13;
enabling the effective functioning of several         institutions in the financial and commercial&#13;
sector. The backbone should therefore be           seen in this context, as a "public good".       This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4Jordan, for example, has penetration levelsof 20, 20 and 10 per 100 people, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      7&#13;

Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
activity is also necessary because it is not easy to attract private financing for backbone&#13;
transmission network development, especially with the current security conditions.&#13;
Public funding of backbone network development will, however, facilitate private&#13;
investment in other revenue-generating segments of the sector including Internet and data&#13;
services, mobile services, and international calls. In addition, expanding the backbone to&#13;
most of the Govemorates of Iraq, as planned under this project, will make it much more&#13;
feasible to extend telecommunications services to rural and remote areas in the future.&#13;
&#13;
22.     Additionally,    the   World     Bank's    support   of   the   national    backbone&#13;
telecommunication infrastructure in the PSD project should be seen in the broader&#13;
context of its support to the development of the telecommunications sector. The World&#13;
Bank has already started and plans to continue providing support to Iraq's efforts to&#13;
reform the telecommunications sector in line with the principles developed by the Iraqi&#13;
officials and summarized in Annex 9.&#13;
&#13;
23.     Capacity building and institutional support. The Bank has identified capacity&#13;
building and institutional support as the main area where it can add value in the&#13;
immediate and long term. Feedback from the Iraqi authorities values the Bank's&#13;
contributions to capacity building. In particular the Bank's approach of working through&#13;
Iraqi line ministries for project implementation is widely appreciated. In this project the&#13;
Bank plans to support the Ministries of Planning and Development Cooperation, Trade&#13;
and Communications capacity building efforts.&#13;
&#13;
24.     There are other important reasons for the World Bank to be involved at this stage&#13;
in supporting the priority areas of the investment climate, the payments and settlements&#13;
system, and telecommunications infrastructure development:&#13;
&#13;
    *   The Iraqi authorities have expressed a strong desire for the World Bank to take&#13;
        the lead on these areas;&#13;
&#13;
    *   The Bank is in a position to share intemational experiences and best practices&#13;
        based on the Bank's considerable intemational experience with private and&#13;
        financial   sector   development,     SOEs     reform,    and    telecommunications&#13;
        infrastructure in conflict-affected areas (including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ethiopia,&#13;
        West Bank and Gaza, and Afghanistan);&#13;
&#13;
    *   Bank financing, unlike the financing of many other donors, will be implemented&#13;
        by Iraq through the country's own institutions (ministries and agencies), which&#13;
        ensures Iraqi ownership and helps build Iraq's institutional capacity, both crucial&#13;
        for the country's sustainable development; and,&#13;
&#13;
    *   The Bank will integrate financing of specific initiatives with policy advice,&#13;
        assisting the GOI with urgent policy decisions, while laying the ground for sector&#13;
        restructuring essential for long-term sustainability of the private sector.&#13;

                              III.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
25.     This project represents the first phase of a proposed series of interventions within&#13;
the comprehensive private sector development strategy to help implement a subset of the&#13;
main pillars that can be done given the current security situation and the Bank's&#13;
comparative advantage. Its objective is to lay the foundation by addressing certain key&#13;
priorities in institutional capacity building and essential communications infrastructure to&#13;
help foster the development of the private and financial sectors. A secondary objective of&#13;
the project is to generate job creation through the development of the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
26.     These objectives will be achieved through:&#13;
&#13;
(i) Development of key enabling public institutions that support the private sector;&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Improving the competitiveness of Iraqi private firms by increasing their access to&#13;
financial and foreign markets;&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Building reliable telecommunications infrastructure to interconnect key parts of the&#13;
Central Bank's payments and settlements system; and&#13;
&#13;
(iv) Building a section of a high capacity national communications network capable of&#13;
supporting corporate needs.&#13;
&#13;
(v) Financing expenditures directly related to project management&#13;
&#13;
       Project Description&#13;
&#13;
27.     The Project combines the following six components:&#13;
&#13;
     &gt; Component (i): Development of enabling public institutions that support the&#13;
        private sector. (Estimated Cost of US$6.8 million)&#13;
&#13;
28.     This component would help establish and/or strengthen key institutions that&#13;
support or encourage the private sector and financial sector in Iraq and enable them to&#13;
play their appropriate role.     The Project will support institutional strengthening with&#13;
business planning, design of procedures, design of any necessary rules and regulations,&#13;
provision of start-up facilities, training, support of twinning arrangements, support for the&#13;
initial activities of the agency, and provision of any other necessary technical assistance&#13;
for selected institutions. The institutions that would be targeted for this assistance are:&#13;
&#13;
     (i)  Investment Promotion Agency.            International experience in post conflict&#13;
     countries shows that an early focus on building investment facilitation and promotion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                           Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    capacity is a key to private sector development. In Iraq, the role of the state and&#13;
    private sector in investment remains a fundamental question. Assistance in this area&#13;
    will focus on: (a) developing a public awareness campaign on the need for and&#13;
    benefits of private investment; and (b) managing an inter-ministerial reform dialogue.&#13;
    Other donors will assist with the detailed work in creating this investment promotion&#13;
    agency5. There are a number of steps that would need to be taken to reach a final&#13;
    recommendation on what form of an IPA would be best for Iraq. The objective of&#13;
    this activity is to develop a detailed business plan that would be presented at the end&#13;
    of this project to the Higher Commission for Investment (to be established) and/or&#13;
    any other authority with the capability of endorsing the plan and the establishment of&#13;
    such a body. The intemational consultants would work closely with the MOPDC and&#13;
    other stakeholders from the public and private sectors to realize this objective. A&#13;
    main activity is the development and implementation of a Public Awareness&#13;
    Campaign (PAC) that would target at minimum the five large govemorates in Iraq&#13;
    using qualitative and quantitative research.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)  Export Promotion Agency. For the private sector to grow, export markets are&#13;
    essential. Because Iraq has been cut off from the international community, this will&#13;
    require extensive support. An agency that can focus on the issues and constraints&#13;
    facing private sector exporters will be helpful in developing an export culture in Iraq.&#13;
    This work will include the institutional support activities mentioned above;&#13;
&#13;
    (iii) Economic Development Fund. The financial sector in Iraq is at a very early&#13;
    stage of development and private banks are not yet ready to support the private&#13;
    sector's SMEs. The support will build capacity so the Fund can eventually provide&#13;
    such services; and&#13;
&#13;
    (iv) Industrial Zones. These zones will provide a mechanism to deal with security&#13;
    issues, infrastructure deficiencies and local economic development.                    The zones are&#13;
    not intended to provide tax havens. Development plans for potential industrial zones&#13;
    will be prepared: one in Basra and the other in Arbil.                  These plans will examine&#13;
    market demand, specification             of infrastructure requirements,             examination of&#13;
    regulatory concerns and the design of an implementation process. The Environmental&#13;
    and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) (Annex 8) will form the&#13;
    basis for the feasibility studies of the two proposed industrial zones.&#13;
&#13;
    &gt; Component (ii): Improving the competitiveness of Iraqi private firms by&#13;
         improving their ability to access finance and foreign markets. (Estimated cost&#13;
         ofUS$5.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
29.      This component will be a pilot to address two elements of market failure that the&#13;
export and private sectors are currently facing in Iraq.                   The first is related to the&#13;
inadequate knowledge the Iraqi export sector has when it comes to accessing export&#13;
markets. As a result of the sanctions, potential export industries in Iraq have deteriorated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5USAID indicated that that they will assist with the detailed work as part ofthe recently awarded PSD&#13;
contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and exporters need to update their products and services      to meet international standards&#13;
and expectations.     Entry to new export markets requires extensive          researching and&#13;
planning that cover target markets, consumer       preferences, product design, etc.      The&#13;
private sector enterprises (especially SMEs) are unable     to mobilize resources to develop&#13;
an export plan at this time. In addition, many exporters      and/or potential exporters lack&#13;
the technical knowledge to develop a viable export      plan that would ease access to new&#13;
markets.&#13;
&#13;
30.     The second market failure refers to the inability of    the Iraqi private enterprises,&#13;
especially SMEs, in obtaining credit for new projects      or businesses. Feasibility studies&#13;
are required by financial institutions before extending   credit for a proposed project. To a&#13;
large extent, SMEs do not have the knowledge to prepare        such studies in-house and the&#13;
management consulting industry in Iraq is incapable of     preparing acceptable studies.&#13;
&#13;
31.     This project will provide assistance to eligible Iraqi     private firms to build the&#13;
necessary capacity to qualify as a potential player      in the new market economy. This&#13;
assistance will be channeled through two agencies:     (i) the Export Promotion Fund (EPF)&#13;
at the Ministry of Trade (MOT), will channel technical         assistance to eligible firms to&#13;
develop export plans to access new export markets;      and (ii) the Economic Development&#13;
Fund (EDF) at the Ministry of Planning and Development             Cooperation will channel&#13;
technical assistance to Iraqi private enterprises to    develop feasibility studies for new&#13;
projects that require funding from financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
      &gt; Component (iii): Building reliable telecommunications              infrastructure to&#13;
          interconnect key parts of the Central Bank's           payments and settlements&#13;
          system. (Estimated Cost of US$3.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
32.     This component will fund the critical physical communications       infrastructure for&#13;
providing enhanced capacity for interconnecting          the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI)&#13;
Headquarters with CBI's Mosul and Basra branches       (currently connected via VSAT) and&#13;
for networking CBI with the two Govemment owned            banks, Rafidain and Rasheed and&#13;
the headquarters of 20 private banks in Baghdad.                 Based on the successful&#13;
implementation of this phase, CBI will establish a             communications network to&#13;
interconnect with banks throughout Iraq. In this regard, the     expanded CBI network will&#13;
make effective use of good and reliable bandwidth capacity      that would become available&#13;
with ITPC beginning April 2006 under this project and       augment it with appropriate state&#13;
of the art technologies to establish transmission links  to banks in other provinces/districts&#13;
of Iraq.&#13;
&#13;
     &gt;    Component      (iv):   Building    a    high     capacity     national    backbone&#13;
          communications network capable of supporting                corporate needs and&#13;
          develop the human capacity to operate it efficiently.          (Estimated Cost of&#13;
          US$39.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
33.     This component supports ITPC's rehabilitation program for       2004-2007 approved&#13;
by the Iraqi Strategic Review Board (ISRB) to build        a modern and integrated national&#13;
digital backbone microwave network to improve       delivery of communications services to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           11&#13;

Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the government and to the people of Iraq. In particular, this component would focus on&#13;
rehabilitating and upgrading three of the five national backbone microwave routes and&#13;
associated spur routes that have been severely damaged.            The three routes are: (i)&#13;
Baghdad-Trabil; (ii) Baghdad-Mosul; and (iii) Baghdad-Ammara-Basra. The remaining&#13;
two routes would be developed under the Japanese Government Bilateral Assistance&#13;
program to Iraq. The backbone microwave systems will provide much needed&#13;
transmission capacity between Baghdad apd the Districts in the North, South and&#13;
Western parts of Iraq.    These microwave links will provide immediate voice and data&#13;
connectivity for the key cities in the districts of Baghdad, Baquba, Kirkuk, Arbil, Mousa,&#13;
Sulaimaniya, Dohuk, Ramadi, Hadetha, Alquaim, Kut, Ammara, Basra and Um Qaser,&#13;
and improve national and international connectivity.&#13;
&#13;
34.     In addition, sufficient capacity will be available to meet the needs of both the&#13;
public sector agencies and the private telecom service providers, thus facilitating and&#13;
enabling    further  competition     and   private    participation in   the   provision   of&#13;
telecommunication services. ITPC will be expected to interconnect with all interested&#13;
telecommunications and data service providers and provide transmission capacity at cost-&#13;
based prices in line with the principles of transparent regulation and fair competition.&#13;
&#13;
35.     This component consists of two parts: (i) supply, installation and commissioning&#13;
of the above three backbone microwave routes and the associated spur microwave routes&#13;
on a single responsibility basis utilizing tried and tested technologies that can be rapidly&#13;
rolled out in the current Iraq environment; and (ii) provision of training and operational&#13;
support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     &gt;    Components (v) and (vi): Financing expenditures directly related to project&#13;
          management. (Estimated Cost of US$ 0.2 million for MOPDC and US$0.5&#13;
          million for ITPC)&#13;
&#13;
36.     The Project will finance expenditures directly related to the management of the&#13;
project such as: procurement consultants; audit consultants; maintenance of office&#13;
equipment; transportation and travel, including per diem allowances for Project staff in&#13;
travel status; rental of office space; utilities and office administration, including&#13;
translation, printing and advertising; fuel costs; communication costs; costs for&#13;
production of bidding documents and drawings; and commercial bank charges.                No&#13;
salaries of the Recipient's civil servants will be financed under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Project Financing&#13;
&#13;
37.     A grant of US$55 million is proposed for the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Development Cooperation, to support the project. The cost of Iraqi staff seconded to the&#13;
Project Management Teams will be covered by the implementing agencies, defined in the&#13;
next section&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           12&#13;

&#13;
                      IV.    IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
38.      This is a multi-sectoral operation with several beneficiaries.       To facilitate&#13;
implementation, the Project components will be grouped into two groups          and will be&#13;
executed by two Implementation agencies (IAs).          Components (i) and (ii) will be&#13;
implemented by the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation              (MOPDC),&#13;
which will also be the Grant Recipient. Components (iii) and (iv) will     be implemented&#13;
by the Iraqi Telecommunications and Post Company; a Subsidiary Grant Agreement&#13;
between the MOPDC and the ITPC will transfer the implementation responsibilities,&#13;
liabilities and accountability to the ITPC for these components.        The ITPC will be&#13;
required to carry out the Project in accordance with similar implementation   arrangements&#13;
agreed between the MOPDC and the World Bank. Furthermore, a             Project Agreement&#13;
between the ITPC and the World Bank will complement the Subsidiary                    Grant&#13;
Agreement. Components (v) and (vi) will be providing financial support to both      IAs, as&#13;
outlined in Annex 2, Table 1.&#13;
&#13;
39.      A Project Management Team (PMT) in each Implementing Agency, namely             the&#13;
MOPDC and the ITPC, will be responsible for the procurement, financial management,&#13;
the management of day-to-day activities, consolidated reporting, and coordination       and&#13;
monitoring of project components. To facilitate coordination and processing,      the PMTs&#13;
would work closely with representatives from Ministries/Agencies involved, such       as the&#13;
Export Promotion Fund and the Economic Development Fund, and the Central           Bank of&#13;
Iraq, to ensure that their needs and requirements are met.&#13;
&#13;
40.      Direct payment by the World Bank is the preferred option and will be made    to the&#13;
consultant/contractor/recipient upon presentation of required documentation by    the PMT,&#13;
and in accordance with the contract between the implementing agency and        the supplier.&#13;
The Bank will recruit international and local consultants to assist the PMT      to finalize&#13;
components' design, prepare tender documents, evaluate bids, and sign contracts.       The&#13;
security situation could prevent Bank staff and international consultants from traveling to&#13;
Iraq during project preparation and implementation. Project supervision    would primarily&#13;
rely on local Iraqi and international consultants with presence in Iraq, supported by Bank&#13;
staff working from outside Iraq. Regional consultants with a branch      office in Baghdad&#13;
have been recruited to assist with project preparation.&#13;
&#13;
         Procurement&#13;
&#13;
General&#13;
&#13;
41.      Procurement for this project will be carried out in accordance with     the World&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"         dated May 2004;&#13;
and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"&#13;
dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Trust Fund Grant     Agreement. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                               Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
general description of various items under different expenditure categories is given&#13;
below. For each contract to be financed by the grant, the procurement methods or&#13;
consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review&#13;
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and the Bank project&#13;
team in the Procurement Plan (PP) (Annex 5). The PP will be updated as required to&#13;
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional&#13;
capacity.    A general procurement notice is planned to be published in the UNDB in&#13;
November 2004 and will be revised after approval.&#13;
&#13;
42.      Procurement of Goods. Goods procured under this project will include supply and&#13;
installation of a microwave backbone component for the ITPC and a telecommunication&#13;
infrastructure component for the Central Bank of Iraq Payments System. The supply and&#13;
installation of a Telecom Backbone component for the nTPC and a Telecommunication&#13;
Infrastructure for the Central Bank of Iraq Payments System will be procured separately&#13;
using International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures and the Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents (SBD) for procurement of Supply and Installation of Plant and Equipment&#13;
and procurement of goods, respectively. Other goods procured under this project would&#13;
include small value office equipment and supplies, furniture and computers.            These&#13;
would be purchased by using either National Competitive Bidding (NCB) or Shopping&#13;
methods depending upon the estimated value for each contract, which will be defined&#13;
during project implementation and in the revised procurement plan. Direct purchase will&#13;
only be used in exceptional cases. The procurement based on NCB procedure will be&#13;
done using the Bank's SBD for procurement of goods. Once an NCB bidding document&#13;
for goods is prepared (currently under preparation as part of the Master Implementation&#13;
Manual, NIvM), reviewed and found satisfactory to the Bank, it will be used instead ofthe&#13;
Bank's SBD for NCB procurement.&#13;
&#13;
43.     Selection of Consultants. Consultant services procured under this project will&#13;
include: (i) institutional strengthening and private sector support; (ii) industrial zones&#13;
development plans; (iii) services of an international procurement consulting firm to build&#13;
ITPC and MOPDC capacity to carry out and manage procurement activities; and, (iv)&#13;
services of individual consultants and/or firms to provide capacity building in financial&#13;
management and consultancy services in telecom engineering, bidding document&#13;
preparation and assisting the ITPC in bid evaluation and installation, testing and&#13;
commissioning supervision. The selection of consulting firms for items (i) (estimated&#13;
cost is US$8,300,000) and (ii) (estimated cost is US$3,000,000) mentioned above will be&#13;
carried out by using Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) and for item (iii)&#13;
(estimated cost is US$300,000) will be based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ)&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
44.     Operating Costs: The grant will finance expenditures directly related to the&#13;
management of the project such as: (i)            maintenance of office equipment; (ii)&#13;
transportation and travel, including per diem allowances for Project staff in travel status;&#13;
(iii) rental of office space; (iv) utilities and office administration, including translation,&#13;
printing and advertising; (v) fuel costs; (vi) communication costs; (vii) costs for&#13;
production of bidding documents and drawings; and (viii) commercial bank charges. No&#13;
salaries of the Recipient's civil servants will be financed under the project. The operating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            14&#13;

costs that will be financed by the project will be procured using the ITPC and MOPDC&#13;
administrative procedures for shopping satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Assessment ofthe agency'scapacityto implement procurement&#13;
&#13;
45.     A generic assessment of Iraqi ministries capacity to implement project&#13;
procurement was conducted in March 2004. Given that the security conditions prevented&#13;
the Bank project team from traveling to Iraq at the time of project preparation, a regional&#13;
consulting firm with local presence in Baghdad was hired by the Bank to conduct an&#13;
assessment of the capacity of the ITPC and MOPDC to implement procurement actions.&#13;
In October 2004, the team's Senior Procurement Specialist and a local procurement&#13;
consultant supplemented missing information in the report of the consulting firm on the&#13;
agencies' procurement capacity through discussions with ITPC staff in Jordan and&#13;
MOPDC       staff in Baghdad      during the pre-appraisal/appraisal      of the project.&#13;
Subsequently, the generic assessment has been revised to reflect the ITPC and MOPDC&#13;
capacity to implement procurement.&#13;
&#13;
46.     Procurement activities will be carried out by the ITPC, a state owned enterprise&#13;
(SOE) and MOPDC separately for each relevant component.             There is a centralized&#13;
procurement section in the current organizational structure of the ITPC. Procurement is&#13;
carried out by the commercial department with a staff of 16 employees with different&#13;
backgrounds like engineering, marketing and administration to issue commercial&#13;
conditions and tender invitations. There are separate committees for bid opening and bid&#13;
analysis &amp; evaluation. These committees would be established based on ad hoc basis&#13;
from three members as minimum.&#13;
&#13;
47.     ITPC is one of the largest SOEs in Iraq. It has 22 sections with a workforce of&#13;
around 14,750 including over 1,000 fully trained engineers.          Large projects were&#13;
implemented by the ITPC during the Oil for Food (OFF) program following UN&#13;
guidelines in the nineties. Since the previous regime collapse in Iraq in April 2003, ITPC&#13;
had implemented 15 local contracts for more than one billion and nine hundreds million&#13;
Iraqi Dinar (approximately US$1.3 million). ITPC had also implemented 5 intemational&#13;
contracts for more than US$21 million. Furthermore, another 5 international contracts&#13;
estimated at US$22 million are in the process of implementation.&#13;
&#13;
48.     The MOPDC is responsible for broadcasting              and promulgating public&#13;
procurement regulations or regulatory guidelines, and procedures set forth by various&#13;
other ministries and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).         The Ministry of Finance is&#13;
responsible for promulgation of financial-related regulations in relation to procurement&#13;
for application and harmonization across the public procurement process. Each major&#13;
department within MOPDC has it's own purchase unit that may procure and contract up&#13;
to 75 million Iraqi Dinar. There is no specialized procurement department in the current&#13;
organization. Centralized procurement section within the legal department has only one&#13;
staff with a legal background.&#13;
&#13;
49.     To strengthen the procurement capacity of ITPC and MOPDC, two procurement&#13;
officers would be appointed to be part of the PMTs.        An intemational procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                              Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
consulting firm with international and local staff would be recruited by the MOPDC to&#13;
provide procurement support and procurement capacity building to the two PMTs and the&#13;
institutions involved in the project implementation.     A simple Project Implementation&#13;
Manual (PIM) is under preparation (it is expected that the manual will be ready by&#13;
January 31, 2005) and the ITPC-PMT and MOPDC-PMT will use this manual in the&#13;
implementation of the project. The PIM will be aligned with the Master Implementation&#13;
Manual (MIM) as soon as the latter becomes available.&#13;
&#13;
PrivateSectorAssessment&#13;
&#13;
50.     The private sector, local and foreign, participates in public procurement of goods&#13;
and services. It is expected that no works contract would be under the project.&#13;
Registration of national contractors by the MOPDC is a routine practice. Contractors are&#13;
classified and ranked against criteria including experience, performance, and financial&#13;
status. There is some 160 contractors class A. A procuring entity may limit the invitation&#13;
to bid to certain classes of contractors.     Based on a meeting with the head of the&#13;
contractors union in Iraq during a mission in Amman in October 2004, local contracts&#13;
seem to be capable to execute works contracts of large projects.         Demonstration of&#13;
financial capacity of contractors may be a difficult task as they used to work on cash&#13;
basis, especially during the previous era.    The contractors showed that they have no&#13;
problems in getting bid securities from local banks and insurance, and welcomed very&#13;
much, training on bid preparation. Training on bid preparation is planned to be part of the&#13;
scope of work of the international procurement consulting firm.&#13;
&#13;
51.     For the consultancy assignment proposed under the project, international/regional&#13;
consulting firms would be selected.      These international consulting firms would be&#13;
encouraged to include local consultants as part of their team.      There are several local&#13;
consulting firms that seem to be capable of taking some tasks for the design, preparation&#13;
of bidding documents and construction supervision but not like those proposed under the&#13;
project. However, local consulting firms have no previous experience with preparation of&#13;
proposals and quality of their work would need to be tested.          Training on proposal&#13;
preparation is planned to be part of the. scope of work of the international procurement&#13;
consulting firm. Insurance requirement in standard Request for Proposal (RFP) is of a&#13;
concern under the current security conditions and it may be difficult for consulting firms&#13;
to provide the required insurance.&#13;
&#13;
52.     Some of the rTPC and MOPDC staff attended the procurement workshops in&#13;
Amman under the Capacity Building I project. The head of the procurement section at&#13;
the rIPC is one of those staff and she was part of the ITPC staff during pre-&#13;
appraisal/appraisal  mission.   The Bank procurement         specialist has provided an&#13;
introductory session on procurement terminology and Bank procurement procedures to&#13;
the Iraqi team and copies of the new procurement guidelines and bidding document were&#13;
provided to the Iraqi team during the mission. The PMT procurement officers for the&#13;
project would need to be assigned prior to the project negotiation.&#13;
&#13;
53.     The overall project risk for procurement is rated high. Most of the issues and&#13;
risks concerning the procurement component for implementation of the project have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
identified in the generic assessment of the ITPC and MOPDC           capacity to implement&#13;
project procurement and include: (i) the lack of sound laws and regulations,        of modem&#13;
standard documentation, and the habits acquired by procurement      staff in the previous era&#13;
which will take time to change; (ii) weakness of MOPDC and       ITPC procurement staff in&#13;
the use of Bank procurement guidelines and international sound       procurement practices;&#13;
(iii) inability of Bank procurement staff to supervise the project in the field; (iv) delays in&#13;
implementing the procurement plan due to lack of experience in procurement            planning&#13;
and the volatile security conditions in Iraq; (v) inability of    international suppliers to&#13;
install the telecom equipment inside Iraq due to security issues;    (vi) possible looting or&#13;
damaging of telecom equipment during land transportation and        storage inside Iraq; (vii)&#13;
delays could be expected in the implementation of some         contracts as well as in bid&#13;
submission due to deteriorated security conditions in some areas      in Iraq; (viii) security&#13;
concerns will discourage international consultants from working inside     Iraq especially for&#13;
the two big consulting contracts for the private sector strengthening   and the development&#13;
of industrial zones plans; and (ix) international consulting     firms may not be able to&#13;
provide the required insurance usually requested in RFP.&#13;
&#13;
54.     The risk mitigating measures which have been agreed upon                 are: (i) two&#13;
procurement officers will be assigned as part of the ITPC-PMT       and MOPDC-PMT; (ii)&#13;
simplified bidding documents and methods, such as shopping and            NCB, and the US&#13;
Dollar as currency of bids for NCB and shopping will be used; (iii)        in the contract, a&#13;
statement will be included that suppliers and contractors will be  responsible for providing&#13;
and guarding       storage  sites during execution     of contracts; (iv) the procured&#13;
telecommunications equipment will be delivered directly to either     the stations where the&#13;
equipment will be installed or to nearby storage sites; and     (v) international consulting&#13;
firms would be encouraged (through putting some extra weight than          normally used on&#13;
local participation) in the request for proposals to team up with local   firms or individual&#13;
consultants. In addition, an international procurement consulting      firm will be hired by&#13;
the MOPDC to build ITPC and MOPDC capacities to carry out and           manage procurement&#13;
activities, set up within the ITPC and MOPDC a procurement monitoring           and reporting&#13;
system, and, assist the ITPC-PMT and MOPDC-PMT in preparing/reviewing                  bidding&#13;
documents and bid evaluation reports. The procurement consulting          firm will also: (a)&#13;
consolidate progress report from MOPDC and ITPC into one comprehensive               report on&#13;
the project; and (b) conduct workshops to the local contractors     and suppliers and local&#13;
consultants on bid preparation and proposal preparation, respectively.        The consulting&#13;
firm will also be available to respond to ad-hoc requests for advice      or training. Until&#13;
security conditions in Iraq improve, training workshops may take           place outside the&#13;
country (preferably in a neighboring country).     A Project Launch Workshop would be&#13;
held in Arabic (or with Arabic translation) soon after Grant Signing.    All staff involved in&#13;
project implementation should attend the workshop and it will      be most critical that this&#13;
staff be assigned on time.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
55.     The ITPC and MOPDC, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan          (Annex 5) for&#13;
project implementation, which provides the basis for the procurement          methods.    This&#13;
initial plan was agreed between the ITPC, and MOPDC and          the Bank project team on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            17&#13;

October 22, 2004, and are available at the ITPC and MOPDC in Baghdad. It will be&#13;
available in the project's database and on the Bank's extemal website soon after grant&#13;
agreement signature. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project&#13;
Team as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in&#13;
institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
FrequencyofProcurementSupervision&#13;
&#13;
56.      In addition to the prior review, supervision to be carried out from Bank offices,&#13;
and based on the capacity assessment of the Implementing Agencies, at least one&#13;
supervision mission is planned every three months to visit the field to carry out post&#13;
reviews of procurement. Until security conditions make travel to Iraq possible for Bank&#13;
staff, the Bank will employ Monitoring Agents, independent firms, which will operate in&#13;
Iraq and support the Bank in carrying out its supervision function, including spot physical&#13;
inspection. In addition, the Bank will rely on reports from a local procurement consultant&#13;
who is working for the Bank from within Iraq. During the interim period, Bank staff and&#13;
the concemed Iraqi procurement staff will meet outside Iraq to do off-site supervision as&#13;
well as use of videoconference facilities.&#13;
&#13;
         Disbursement&#13;
&#13;
57.     The proposed grant of US$55 million is expected to be disbursed over a period of&#13;
approximately three years.&#13;
&#13;
58.     The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen&#13;
institutional capacity by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries&#13;
and other recipient entities. Trained Project Management Teams (PMTs) will facilitate&#13;
implementation and help ensure compliance with fiduciary and other safeguards. PMTs&#13;
will be employed and paid by the implementing entity at regular salary levels, thereby&#13;
avoiding the disadvantages of stand-alone Project Implementation Units that can erode&#13;
civil service institutional capacity over the medium and long term.       The project will&#13;
finance specialized technical support in procurement, financial management, and other&#13;
areas as needed. In addition, to ensure that project funds are used for the purposes&#13;
intended and to help carry out project supervision, the Bank will employ two independent&#13;
firms as fiduciary and safeguard Monitoring Agents.&#13;
&#13;
59.     As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily by&#13;
direct payment through the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors as follows:&#13;
The MOPDC will submit to the Bank a letter designating the official or officials&#13;
authorized to withdraw funds from the proceeds of the grant along with their specimen&#13;
signatures for authentication. As expenditures are incurred, the PMTs submit to the Bank&#13;
withdrawal applications for direct payments duly signed by authorized representatives in&#13;
favor of contractors, consultants or vendors, accompanied by supporting documents&#13;
validating eligibility of expenditures. Upon receipt of applications, the Bank will effect&#13;
payments directly into the account of the contractor, consultant, or vendor indicated on&#13;
the application, which is normally a commercial bank capable of receiving funds&#13;
transferred from the international banking system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        18&#13;

Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
60.     The project management component and payments below the                  threshold of&#13;
US$10,000 normally will be made through payments by             the MOPDC-PMT and the&#13;
ITPC-PMT own resources. These payments made from the recipient's          own resources will&#13;
be reimbursed on a periodic basis, by the Bank to the MOPDC-PMT           and the ITPC-PMT,&#13;
upon presentation of supporting documents, proof of payment        and a signed withdrawal&#13;
application. The PMTs and the main financial counterparts from         the MOPDC and the&#13;
ITPC will be subject to intensive training in the Bank's Disbursement    Procedures.&#13;
&#13;
        Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
61.     Bank policies require that grant proceeds be used only for the purposes      for which&#13;
they were granted, with due regard to economy, efficiency,              and the sustainable&#13;
achievement of the project's development objectives. The recipient      is requested to cause&#13;
the PMTs to maintain an adequate financial management            system during the project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
62.     The project will be implemented by the MOPDC and the Iraqi                ITPC. Each&#13;
implementing agency will be responsible for the proper financial     management of its own&#13;
components. MOPDC will be responsible for preparing the aggregated             annual project&#13;
financial statements and having them audited by a qualified external    auditor acceptable to&#13;
the Bank following internationally accepted standards. MOPDC        will also be responsible&#13;
for submitting the audit report to the Bank within six months of year-end.&#13;
&#13;
63.     Financial Management Risk Assessment Summary.            The financial management&#13;
risk associated with this operation is considered high. Critical risk factors are: (i) ongoing&#13;
insecurity, which prevents on-site Bank supervision and assessments,      including financial&#13;
assessments; (ii) the Bank's limited knowledge of Iraq's public financial        management&#13;
systems, controls, and procedures; (iii) the limited knowledge on           the part of Iraqi&#13;
authorities of Bank policies and guidelines; (iv) the possibility         that implementing&#13;
agencies may not make available on a timely basis financial resources     to honor payments&#13;
below the value of US$10,000; (v) difficult communication and           flow of information&#13;
between worksites and the PMT, which could delay payments;              (vi) inefficiencies in&#13;
Iraq's banking system that delay payments and transfer of funds to     contractors, suppliers,&#13;
or implementing agencies; and (vii) difficulty in verifying       justification for variation&#13;
orders and possibility of variation orders exceeding price    contingencies. Although the&#13;
project design mitigates to the extent possible these risks, the project    will require close&#13;
monitoring and supervision during implementation.&#13;
&#13;
64.     The control risks will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional   controls&#13;
and procedures including: (a) each PMT will verify and authorize      all payments under the&#13;
grant for its respective implementing agency, and verify justification   for variation orders;&#13;
(b) the PMTs will include competent financial staff from the implementing        agencies and&#13;
will be supported by financial management consultants; (c)      the ITPC and MOPDC will&#13;
assign internal auditors to track the project activities and       verify   project financial&#13;
transactions; (d) disbursements by the Bank will be made by direct          payments and on&#13;
reimbursement basis supported by documentation; and (e)           the fiduciary Monitoring&#13;
Agent will review Project expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            19&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
65.     The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple&#13;
parallel accounting system      using spreadsheet applications, capable of recording all&#13;
project   expenditures,   tracking project   commitments       in real   time  during the&#13;
implementation period, and providing the data needed for the generation of project&#13;
reports, including the project's Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).&#13;
&#13;
66.     The project financial management arrangements            and procedures will be&#13;
documented in a chapter of the project implementation plan and are in line with the&#13;
Master Implementation Manual. Details of the financial management assessment,&#13;
identified risks and project financial management arrangements is in Annex 7.&#13;
&#13;
67.     Reporting to Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger&#13;
accounts in respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF.&#13;
Within ninety (90) days of the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30,&#13;
and December 31), the Bank will prepare, on a cash basis, an unaudited statement of&#13;
receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to&#13;
each donor. Each such statement will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency&#13;
in which the ITF funds will be maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred&#13;
and eighty (180) days of the completion of all disbursements relating to activities&#13;
financed from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on a cash basis an unaudited financial&#13;
statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and&#13;
forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
&#13;
68.     The Bank will furnish to the donors:&#13;
&#13;
        (a) on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of the&#13;
            ITF (including contributions, disbursements, and implementation progress) in&#13;
            the preceding six months; and&#13;
&#13;
        (b) on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation from&#13;
            the Bank's external auditors, conceming the adequacy of internal control over&#13;
            cash-based financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
69.     The Bank will require a financial statement audit of the ITF to be performed by&#13;
the Bank's external auditors on an annual basis. The costs of such an audit, including the&#13;
internal costs of the Bank with respect to the audit, will be charged to the ITF. The Bank&#13;
will provide each donor with a copy of the auditor's report.&#13;
&#13;
70.     The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the donors. The&#13;
Bank will provide each donor to the ITF with semi-annual reports on its quarterly ex-post&#13;
evaluation of the activities undertaken by the Monitoring Agents. Within six months of&#13;
completion of the activities, or of full disbursement of the contributions, whichever&#13;
comes later, the Bank will provide a final progress report to each donor, together with a&#13;
copy of the independent review of the performance of the Monitoring Agents. Upon&#13;
request by any donor, the Bank will send to such donor the draft and final reports&#13;
received by the Bank from the Monitoring Agents on the activities financed by the&#13;
contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        20&#13;

        Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
71.     The project is an emergency project and will be processed under Operational&#13;
Procedure (OP) 8.50 (Emergency Recovery Project). Based on section 13 of OP 4.01,&#13;
exemption has been sought from the Bank's executive management (March 2004) in&#13;
order that any Environmental Assessment requirements will not be conducted prior to&#13;
project appraisal. Hence, the environmental assessment mitigating measures (if any) will&#13;
be carried out during project implementation under provisions incorporated in the&#13;
construction contracts. However, the project will have to comply with the Environmental&#13;
and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF). The ESSAF entails that: (a)&#13;
sub-projects be screened by the Recipient through the checklist attached to the&#13;
Framework; (b) a code of practice be included as part of the design, preparation and civil&#13;
work contracts as well as of purchase and installation of equipment contracts, and (c) the&#13;
Safeguard Procedures, as per Attachment 6 of the ESSAF, would be included in the&#13;
Technical Specifications of the contracts of all Contractors.&#13;
&#13;
72.     Out of the 4 components, only component (iii) and (iv) will entail physical work.&#13;
The proposed digital microwave backbone would connect Baghdad and key Iraqi cities&#13;
and would replace the old analogue microwave system. The Iraq Telecommunications&#13;
and Post Company (ITPC) has confirmed that the upgraded digital microwave backbone&#13;
network will be implemented on existing sites and will use existing buildings. There will&#13;
be some rehabilitation work, which, as necessary, will be done through an ITPC led&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
73.     A preliminary screening of environmental and social issues for components (iii)&#13;
and (iv) using the ESSAF has been undertaken by a consultant firm based on available&#13;
information. Initial analyses indicate that the environmental and social impacts are likely&#13;
to be negligible.   The ESSAF will be updated with site level information prior to&#13;
implementation of activities at the site level.&#13;
&#13;
74.     Under component (i) there is a sub-component which will conduct feasibility&#13;
studies for two proposed industrial zones. This calls for the project to be classified as a&#13;
Category B project, and the ESSAF will be the basis upon which the feasibility studies&#13;
will be undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
75.     The PMTs will be responsible for applying the safeguard screening and mitigation&#13;
measures. A Safeguards Focal Point (SFP) will be identified within the ITPC and the&#13;
MOPDC with the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the framework and&#13;
the compliance with the environmental and safety codes of practices. The roles and&#13;
responsibilities of key stakeholders in ensuring application of sound environmental and&#13;
social standards during reconstruction and rehabilitation activities will be clarified prior&#13;
to appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
        Gender&#13;
&#13;
76.     The Project will benefit households in general by providing: (i)increased level of&#13;
participation in both private and public sector enterprises through enhanced employment;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         21&#13;

&#13;
(ii) better telecommunication services and Internet services; (iii) well-functioning P&amp;S&#13;
system, better access to credit, and modem banking facilities; and (iv) improved access to&#13;
education and health services through better communications systems.           Investment&#13;
Climate studies in the Bank, show women managed businesses make significantly greater&#13;
use of the Internet and allied technologies. Strengthening the telecommunications and&#13;
Internet system is likely to help this targeted group in particular.&#13;
&#13;
77.     The outcomes and types of public works planned under the project are expected to&#13;
generate labor opportunities for women, with more telecommunications and IT centers&#13;
opened, which will primarily be employing women. During the process of consultations&#13;
with local communities, separate arrangements shall be made to ensure participation by&#13;
and consultation with women, as they cannot be expected to be covered through the&#13;
general community consultations.&#13;
&#13;
78.     Women's issues will be promoted through several aspects at the institutional&#13;
strengthening component, by encouraging their inclusion in governance arrangements of&#13;
the institutions, and requiring gender to be accounted in the business planning process.&#13;
Under the opportunities program, opportunities to support women's businesses will be&#13;
encouraged.&#13;
&#13;
        Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
79.     Performance indicators have been established for each component of this project&#13;
during project appraisal, and will be measured bi-annually (Annex 10).      Development&#13;
objectives will be measured according to the Project's procurement plan. A quarterly&#13;
progress report for all components will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by the&#13;
PMT of each IA.       A full supervision mission is planned quarterly, with specialists&#13;
monitoring performance through videoconferences.&#13;

&#13;
              V.      FINANCIAL AND ECONOMICAL JUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
80.    The benefits of the project are expected to be substantial compared to its costs, as&#13;
the project will address urgent needs of private and financial sector development, trade&#13;
promotion, employment generation and infrastructure rehabilitation in a devastated&#13;
environment.    The private sector is expected to play a leading rQle in economic&#13;
development in Iraq in the future.         The Iraqi National Development Strategy has&#13;
emphasized this role.    Increased level of private investment and trade are critical for&#13;
economic growth and employment generation.&#13;
&#13;
81.     Technical assistance to the export promotion fund and the economic development&#13;
fund will strengthen them institutionally and foster public private partnerships&#13;
encouraging new employment and income generating initiatives.           In addition, direct&#13;
Technical Assistance to approximately 150 private firms channeled through the two&#13;
funds would enable a significant number of beneficiaries to embark on new investments&#13;
and projects leading to job creation and revenue generation. It is also expected that a&#13;
strong local management consulting sector will be created through this activity.&#13;
&#13;
82.     Furthermore,   a strong telecommunications        infrastructure is key for the&#13;
development of effective government, trade system, private corporations including small&#13;
and medium enterprises, and the financial system. Telecommunications will also be an&#13;
early mover in the area of SOE reform. It is a sector that is fundamentally profitable, and&#13;
has significant scope, if liberalized, to generate employment. In a few years it would not&#13;
be unreasonable to expect the wider information communications technology sector to&#13;
generate 100,000 new jobs. It will also lead to the reform of the entire SOE infrastructure&#13;
sector in Iraq and establishing an effective regulatory system.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
83.     The proposed Project is subject to substantial risks, including: (i) security risks;&#13;
(ii) political risks; (iii) Government commitment; and (iv) unfamiliarity with Bank&#13;
safeguards and procedures (accountability, financial management, and procurement). To&#13;
mitigate these risks, several mitigations measures have been identified.                 Training on&#13;
project management and procurement will be provided and the Project provides for&#13;
additional training and capacity building for PMT staff. Security issues will be managed&#13;
through project and contract design, and the extensive use of national consultants and&#13;
contractors. Critical Government commitments to project success have been identified&#13;
and secured.         Table 1 below outlines specific risks and their respective mitigation&#13;
measures.&#13;

Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                               Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       Annex 3: Detailed Project Components Description&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Component (i): Development of enabling public institutions         that support the private&#13;
sector&#13;
&#13;
This component is proposed to strengthen and/or establish       four institutions that would&#13;
help build the foundations for private sector development.           The level of proposed&#13;
assistance under this project would vary as some of the institutions   already exist whereas&#13;
others need to be established and go through a longer         process of assistance to be&#13;
developed.     The institutions targeted in this project are: (i) the Investment   Promotion&#13;
Agency; (ii) the Export Promotion Agency; (iii) the Economic             Development Fund&#13;
(already exists); and (iv) two industrial zones, in Arbiland Basra.&#13;
&#13;
1.       Investment Promotion Agency:&#13;
&#13;
There are a number of steps that would need to be taken to    reach a final recommendation&#13;
on what form of an IPA would be best for Iraq. The          objective of this activity is to&#13;
develop a detailed business plan that would be presented    at the end of this project to the&#13;
Higher Commission for Investment (to be established) and/or     any other authority with the&#13;
capability of endorsing the plan and the establishment        of such a body.       It is not&#13;
envisioned that the IPA will be established under this         project.    The international&#13;
consultants would work closely with the MOPDC and other        stakeholders from the public&#13;
and private sectors to realize this objective.    A main activity is the development and&#13;
implementation of a Public Awareness Campaign (PAC) to        assess the role of the state in&#13;
promoting investment. The PAC would target at minimum         the five large governorates in&#13;
Iraq using qualitative and quantitative research. An effective    working group (WG) that&#13;
includes senior officials (with decision making capabilities)      from relevant ministries,&#13;
private sector representatives, and academia will be formed   to work closely with the local&#13;
and international consultants on developing the PAC and       the business plan. Detailed&#13;
analysis of all aspects of Investment Climate including markets,   sectors, legal, regulatory,&#13;
fiscal, labor, banking sector will be carried out. Workshops,      training, study tours and&#13;
technical assistance services will be provided to the WG     and the investment promotion&#13;
units at the relevant ministries to enable them to make educated    decisions throughout the&#13;
process.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Export Promotion Agency&#13;
&#13;
The objective of this activity is to strengthen the Export Promotion     Fund (EPF) that is&#13;
currently housed in the Ministry of Trade (MoT) through technical        assistance services,&#13;
training, study tours, and provision of necessary      equipment.     In addition, technical&#13;
assistance will be provided to a technical committee that    would include representatives&#13;
from the EPF, the private sector, and other relevant public        and private agencies, to&#13;
develop a detailed business plan that would address      and develop recommendations on&#13;
main issues such as: (a) governance structure;   (b) mandate and by-laws; (c) stakeholders;&#13;
(d) implementation plan; (e) role in accessing to the WTO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.      Economic Development Fund&#13;
&#13;
Established in 2000 to provide lines of credit to the industrial sector, the Fund has been&#13;
inactive and suspended its services since the war. The Fund operates under the MOPDC.&#13;
The Fund has updated its strategic plan, which proposed amendments to its mandate,&#13;
govemance, and scope of services to empower the private sector.            According to the&#13;
strategic plan, the Fund has frozen funds in Iraqi state banks and regional banks.&#13;
&#13;
The main objective of this activity is to support and strengthen the fund by providing&#13;
technical assistance through intemational and local consultants to enable it to operate as a&#13;
public-private partnership that provides business services and technical assistance to&#13;
small and medium enterprises in the private sector. The consultant will work with a&#13;
technical committee that would include representatives from the Fund, the MOPDC, the&#13;
private sector, and other relevant public and private agencies, to develop a detailed&#13;
business plan that would address and develop recommendations on main issues such as:&#13;
(a) govemance structure; (b) mandate and by-laws; (c) stakeholders; (d) implementation&#13;
plan; (e) and potential growth as an independent financial institution to serve the SME&#13;
sector in Iraq.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Industrial Zones&#13;
&#13;
Development plans will be prepared for two industrial zones, one in Basra and one in&#13;
Arbil. These zones provide a mechanism to deal with security issues, infrastructure&#13;
deficiencies and local economic development. The zones are not intended to provide tax&#13;
havens. The first step is for intemational and local consultants to conduct a detailed site&#13;
analysis to determine the most feasible site for these industrial zones. It is imperative that&#13;
the consultants work closely with the MOPDC and the respective govemorates to secure&#13;
a commitment from the local and federal govemments to allocate the identified land for&#13;
the proposed industrial zone. The second step will involve preparing development plans&#13;
that would include: (a) site analysis; (b) market analysis; (c) infrastructure and civil&#13;
works designs; (d) environmental impact analysis; (e) legal and regulatory framework;&#13;
and (f) social impact assessment. The Environmental and Social Screening and&#13;
Assessment Framework (ESSAF) (Annex 8) will form the basis for the feasibility studies&#13;
of the two proposed industrial zones.&#13;
&#13;
Component (ii): Improving the competitiveness of Iraqiprivate firms by improving&#13;
their ability to access finance and foreign markets.&#13;
&#13;
This component will be a pilot to address two of the market failures currently facing the&#13;
export sector and the private sector in Iraq.       The first is related to the inadequate&#13;
knowledge the Iraqi export sector has when it comes to accessing export markets. As a&#13;
result of the sanctions, potential export industries in Iraq have deteriorated and exporters&#13;
need to update their products and services to meet intemational standards and&#13;
expectations. Entry to new export markets requires extensive research and planning that&#13;
cover target markets, consumer preferences, product design, etc.         Private enterprises&#13;
(especially SMEs) are either unable to mobilize resources to develop an export plan or do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                              Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
not value this exercise.    In addition, many exporters or potential exporters lack the&#13;
technical knowledge to develop a viable export plan that would ease access to new&#13;
markets.&#13;
&#13;
The second market failure addresses the inability of the Iraqi private enterprises,&#13;
especially SMEs, to compete in the reconstruction efforts and/or obtaining credit for new&#13;
projects or businesses. Feasibility studies are required by almost all financial institutions&#13;
before extending credit for a proposed project. To a large extent, SMEs do not have the&#13;
knowledge to prepare such studies in-house and the management consulting industry in&#13;
Iraq is not used to preparing such studies.&#13;
&#13;
This project will build the pipeline necessary to qualify the private sector as potential&#13;
player in the new market economy by providing firm level assistance to eligible Iraqi&#13;
private firms through two agencies. Through the Export Promotion Fund at the Ministry&#13;
of Trade, technical assistance will be provided to approximately 100 eligible enterprises&#13;
to develop export plans to enable them to explore opportunities in accessing new export&#13;
markets.     The Economic Development Fund at the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Development Cooperation will channel technical assistance for Iraqi private enterprises&#13;
to develop feasibility studies for new projects that require funding from financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This component would begin, to build the necessary knowledge of the private sector and&#13;
to increase the capacity of the local management consulting sector. If proven successful&#13;
and based on demand, future projects, could assist the Iraqi private sector, especially&#13;
SMEs, in co-financing implementation of export plans and projects through matching&#13;
grants schemes.&#13;
&#13;
Export Promotion Fund (EPF)&#13;
&#13;
Description and Activities to be Financed. This is a pilot with the objective to assist&#13;
approximately 100 Iraqi private firms (especially SMEs) to explore the potential to access&#13;
international markets and if deemed feasible assist in co-financing their activities to enter&#13;
export markets under future projects. The EPF will assist the Iraqi private enterprises&#13;
that demonstrate the ability and the commitment to enter export markets.&#13;
&#13;
This Project will concentrate on developing the benchmarks necessary to enter new&#13;
export markets. This will be done through two windows.&#13;
&#13;
1.       Firm Level Assistance - Developing Export Plans.              Before entering new&#13;
markets, firms will need to determine the feasibility of this activity. Firms, therefore, will&#13;
have to prepare a detailed export plan that would include at minimum information on: (a)&#13;
developing and/or enhancing new export products; and (b) new export markets.&#13;
&#13;
An export plan typically covers the following components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                         Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     *   Currentsituation. Analysis of the current situation of the firm including physical&#13;
         and financial status, its products, its long-term objectives, and its commitment              to&#13;
         grow.&#13;
     *   Market analysis. Detailed market analysis that includes strengths and weaknesses&#13;
         of the firm, and available opportunities at export markets. The market                analysis&#13;
         will also include investigation of target markets, including                size and growth&#13;
         potential, product and/or service preferences such as product design, standards,&#13;
         etc.&#13;
     *   Action plan. Based on the information and data collected, the export                 plan will&#13;
         include a detailed action plan from planning to reach target markets.              Depending&#13;
         on the status of the firm, additional steps might be necessary before the firm can&#13;
         actually start selling. These steps might include adapting products           and/or services&#13;
         by modifying design, rationalizing production to reduce costs and                     improve&#13;
         quality, and meeting international            and/or target market's          standards and&#13;
         requirements.&#13;
     *   Financialanalysis. Financial analysis would include at minimum, the cost                     of&#13;
         producing the exportable products/services, operational costs,           and a rate of return&#13;
         on investment over a number of years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
An export plan will be a necessary condition to seek future funding                         to support&#13;
implementation. Under this Project, the objective is to assist           approximately 100 private&#13;
firms in developing export plans.            International and local experts will provide the&#13;
assistance through the international firm that is awarded the contract.&#13;
&#13;
2.       International Competitiveness.           This component will focus on assessing and&#13;
building knowledge of the sectors that can be competitive in                  international markets&#13;
including light manufacturing such as machine parts, light building                 material, cultural&#13;
traditional handicrafts and rugs, natural resources based            industries such as dates, food&#13;
processing, oils, detergents, and services such as inbound tourism6.                 Typically, these&#13;
industries are small and medium industries (SMIs) and are located                      throughout the&#13;
country. The EPF through international and local consultants will complete,               at minimum,&#13;
the following activities for each sector and/or industry:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    *    Analysis of the macroeconomic and policy impediments preventing                   the private&#13;
         sector from entering new export markets&#13;
    *    Identification of microeconomic factors in each industry that impact             exports such&#13;
         as technical know-how, incentives, labor regulations,          product designs, standards,&#13;
         etc.&#13;
    *    Strategies on how to develop, grow, and sustain Iraq's integration in the&#13;
         international markets including regional markets&#13;
    *    Develop an action plan for each industry with the objective           to transform it into a&#13;
         viable exportable sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6Inbound tourism includes all types of travel includingbusiness, religious and leisure. Services that are&#13;
necessary to increase inbound tourism include accommodation such as hotels, food and beverage&#13;
establishments, and transportation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                               Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Develop joint ventures with intemational firms to transfer technology and&#13;
         information and access markets.&#13;
&#13;
The two components of the EPF will build the necessary foundations to discern industries&#13;
and firms that are capable in the immediate and medium term          of entering new export&#13;
markets. In addition, the proposed approach will have an added value of building the&#13;
capacity of the Iraqi stakeholders including consulting services, independent research&#13;
centers, universities, and the capacity of the EPF.&#13;
&#13;
The implementation phase, will build on the results of this phase and would be financed&#13;
under a separate project. Future projects could co-finance the activities necessary to enter&#13;
new export markets using matching grant schemes.&#13;
&#13;
Funding mechanisms.         Funds from the Project will cover the cost of technical and&#13;
marketing services by local and intemational experts required to develop the export&#13;
plans. It aims at providing assistance directly to approximately 100 enterprises. The&#13;
project will also finance the intemational competitiveness studies. The priority sectors&#13;
and/or industries will be determined by the EPF technical committee that would include&#13;
international experts in addition to representatives from the private sector. It is expected&#13;
that at least two SMIs will be covered under this phase.&#13;
&#13;
Firmeligibilitv. Technical assistance would be provided to individual Iraqi private firms&#13;
in manufacturing and tradable services that have export potential, with no less than 5&#13;
employees and no more than 300 employees. Exporters who use trading companies&#13;
would be considered direct exporters, and therefore eligible for the scheme.&#13;
&#13;
Size of resources available. The resources that will be channeled through the EPF are&#13;
estimated to start with US$3 million from the Grant. After one year, and depending on&#13;
demand, additional resources might be mobilized to assist additional new firms.&#13;
&#13;
Management. A management technical committee headed by the Director of the Export&#13;
Promotion Fund at the Ministry of Trade would manage and supervise the EPF. The&#13;
committee would include intemational experts in export development. The committee&#13;
would also cooperate closely with the MOPDC through the PMT set up for the overall&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
Economic Development Fund&#13;
&#13;
Description and Activities to be Financed. This is a pilot with the objective to assist&#13;
approximately 50 Iraqi private firms (especially SMEs) to conduct feasibility studies for&#13;
projects that they would want to develop and where such studies are necessary to obtain&#13;
credit from financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Prior to embarking on a new business venture in any sector, firms should conduct&#13;
detailed analysis of the proposed project to determine its feasibility given the market, the&#13;
environment, and potential growth.         In addition, almost all commercial financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                 Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
institutions require some level of feasibility analysis before extending credit to the&#13;
applicant.&#13;
&#13;
The capacity of the management consulting industry in Iraq is limited and only few, if&#13;
any, can conduct a credible detailed feasibility analysis.         It is expected that Iraqi&#13;
consulting firms will develop capacity by linking with international firms and/or&#13;
consultants in the early stages of this project. This would enable the Iraqi consulting&#13;
industry to develop and to provide part, if not all, of the services to Iraqi firms in the later&#13;
stages of this project.&#13;
&#13;
A feasibility study typically covers the following components:&#13;
&#13;
    *    ProjectDescription. This describes the project as envisioned by the developer&#13;
         including all its components.&#13;
    *   Market analysis. Detailed market analysis that includes (depending on the type of&#13;
         project) site analysis, demographic analysis of potential markets, determination of&#13;
         target markets, competition, demand forecast, etc.&#13;
    *   Development Plan. Describes the development phases of the project from&#13;
         inception to operation.&#13;
    *    Financialanalysis. Financial analysis would include at minimum, a projected pro&#13;
         forma that includes operating revenues and expenses, debt service analysis, and&#13;
         the return on investment.&#13;
    *   Impact Analysis. In some cases, where public sector's involvement is evident,&#13;
         feasibility studies could include detailed economic and financial impact analysis&#13;
         to measure the impact of the proposed project on the national, regional and/or&#13;
         local economy. Variables measured include jobs created, additional output and&#13;
         tax revenues.&#13;
&#13;
Funding mechanisms. The Grant will cover the cost of feasibility studies conducted by&#13;
local and international consultants.       It aims at providing assistance directly to&#13;
approximately 50 enterprises that present innovative projects.&#13;
&#13;
Firm eliaibilitv. Financing support would be provided to individual Iraqi private firms&#13;
in manufacturing and tradable services with no less than 5 employees and no more than&#13;
300 employees that show commitment and capacity to develop the proposed project.&#13;
Proposed projects that are labor intensive and/or develop an industry with export&#13;
potential might have priority over other projects.&#13;
&#13;
Size of resources available. The resources that are expected to be channeled through the&#13;
EDF are estimated to start with US$2 million from the Bank.              After one year, and&#13;
depending on demand, additional resources might be mobilized to assist additional new&#13;
firms.&#13;
&#13;
Management.         A management technical committee headed by the Director of the&#13;
Economic Development Fund at the MOPDC will manage and supervise the EDF. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            40&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
committee would coordinate directly with the Project Director of the overall project at the&#13;
ministry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Component       (iii):  Building   reliable   telecommunications      infrastructure to&#13;
interconnect key parts of the Central Bank's payments and settlements system.&#13;
&#13;
This component will fund the critical physical communications infrastructure for&#13;
providing enhanced capacity for interconnecting CBI Headquarters in Baghdad with&#13;
CBI's branches in Mosul and Basra (currently connected via VSAT) and for networking&#13;
CBI with the two Government owned banks Rafidain and Rasheed and the headquarters&#13;
of 20 private banks in Baghdad. Based on successful implementation of this phase, CBI&#13;
will establish communications network to interconnect with banks throughout Iraq. In&#13;
this regard, the expanded CBI network will make effective use of good and reliable&#13;
bandwidth capacity that would become available with ITPC beginning April 2006 under&#13;
this project and augment it with appropriate state of the art technologies to establish&#13;
transmission links to banks in other provinces/districts of Iraq. The network layout is&#13;
shown in Figure 2 below.&#13;
&#13;
Specifically it provides for the supply and installation, on a single responsibility, of all&#13;
the infrastructure needed to support Iraq's Central Bank needs to link its offices in&#13;
Baghdad with the two Government owned banks and the headquarters of 20 private&#13;
banks in Baghdad by end 2005, and then to establish transmission links to banks in other&#13;
provinces/districts of Iraq in a phased manner by end 2006.         State-of-the-art WI-FI&#13;
network based on digital radio technology as well as VSAT links combined with wireless&#13;
networks will be deployed in conjunction with ITPC backbone systems to achieve least&#13;
cost and reliable networks to connect banks both in Baghdad and the banks in other cities&#13;
and rural areas of Iraq.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                               Technical Annex&#13;

Component (iv): Building a high capacity national               backbone communications&#13;
network capable of supporting corporate needs and          develop the human capacity to&#13;
operate it efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
This component partly supports ITPC's rehabilitation     program for 2004 - 2007 approved&#13;
by the Iraqi Strategic Review Board (ISRB) to build          a modem and integrated long&#13;
distance digital backbone microwave routes to improve          delivery of communications&#13;
services to the government and to the people of Iraq. In particular,   this component would&#13;
focus on rehabilitating and upgrading three of the five       national backbone microwave&#13;
routes and associated spur routes that have been severely    damaged. The three routes are:&#13;
(i) Baghdad-Tarbil;     (ii) Baghdad-Mosul; and (iii) Baghdad-Amara-Basra.               The&#13;
remaining two routes would be developed under           the Japanese Government Bilateral&#13;
Assistance program to Iraq. The backbone microwave        systems will provide much needed&#13;
transmission capacity between Baghdad and the Districts           in the North, South and&#13;
Western parts of Iraq. These microwave links will provide         immediate voice and data&#13;
connectivity for the key cities: Baghdad, Baquba, Kirkuk,        Arbil, Mousa, Sulaimaniya,&#13;
Duhuok, Ramadi, Hadetha, Alquaim, Kut, Amara,           Basra and Um Quser in the above&#13;
Districts and improve national and international connectivity.&#13;
&#13;
Sufficient capacity will be available to meet the needs of both    the public sector agencies&#13;
and the private telecommunications service providers         thus facilitating and enabling&#13;
further competition and private participation in the       provision of telecommunication&#13;
services. ITPC will be expected to interconnect with all      interested telecommunications&#13;
and data service providers and sell them transmission capacity       they may need at cost-&#13;
based prices in line with the principles of transparent regulation and fair competition.&#13;
&#13;
ITPC have confirmed that the up-graded digital microwave          backbone network will be&#13;
implemented on existing sites and will use existing buildings.          There will be some&#13;
rehabilitation work, which, as necessary, will be done through     an ITPC led project. This&#13;
component consists of two parts: (i) supply, installation and   commissioning of the above&#13;
three backbone microwave routes and the associated spur       microwave routes on a single&#13;
responsibility basis utilizing tried and tested technologies thatcan be rapidly rolled out in&#13;
the current Iraq environment; and (ii) provision of training and operational  support.&#13;
&#13;
The scope of goods and services that would be funded are:&#13;
&#13;
Part One - Microwave Routes: consists of supply,       installation and commissioning of a&#13;
fully functional digital telecommunications         long-distance backbone routes (radio&#13;
microwave and multiplexing), and associated facilities such       as towers including tower&#13;
foundations, antennas, spares parts, diesel generators     with back up batteries including&#13;
rectifiers, a Centralized Network Centralized Management           system in Baghdad, test&#13;
equipments and 5 maintenance vehicles for the three       microwave routes and associated&#13;
spur routes. Details of system configuration are in     the attached diagrams. Equipment&#13;
requirement schedules are available in the project file&#13;
&#13;
Part Two -     Training and Operational Support: ITPC staff            has lacked sufficient&#13;
opportunities to develop the skills necessary to        operate and maintain the various&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         43&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
equipments/ technologies to be deployed in the microwave backbone routes. The bidder&#13;
selected to expand the network, will be required to provide Operation and Maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) services, and to provide these training services. In addition the project provides&#13;
for training ITPC staff in the fields of technical, managerial, financial, commercial and&#13;
legal issues related to telecommunications operations. The project would fund the cost of&#13;
training 24 ITPC staff in the above fields.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     &gt;    Components (v) and (vi): Financing expenditures directly related to project&#13;
          management. (Estimated Cost of US$ 0.2 million for MOPDC and US$0.5&#13;
          million for ITPC)&#13;
&#13;
The Project will finance expenditures directly related to the management of the project&#13;
such as: procurement consultants; audit consultants; maintenance of office equipment;&#13;
transportation and travel, including per diem allowances for Project staff in travel status;&#13;
rental of office space; utilities and office administration, including translation, printing&#13;
and advertising; fuel costs; communication costs; costs for production of bidding&#13;
documents and drawings; and commercial bank charges. No salaries of the Recipient's&#13;
civil servants will be financed under the project.&#13;

2.      Reference to Project Implementation Manual&#13;
&#13;
The Project Management Teams (MOPDC-PMT and YTPC-PMT) will prepare a simple&#13;
Project Implementation Manual (PIM) by end-January 2005. The PIM will be adapted to&#13;
conform to the Master Implementation Manual (MIM) when it is finalized. The MIM is&#13;
being prepared by an international consulting firm financed under the capacity building&#13;
trust fund for Iraq, and is planned to be finalized by November 2004.&#13;

4.      Procurement Packages with Methods and Time Schedule&#13;
&#13;
There are no works contracts under the project. The project mainly will finance large&#13;
goods contracts and large consultancy contracts. The procurement of goods will be by&#13;
using ICB procedures.        The large two consultancy contracts will be procured using&#13;
QCBS. There is no domestic preference under the project. A detailed procurement plan is&#13;
attached.&#13;

   5.  Single Source (individual)        All&#13;
&#13;
2.      Short list comprising entirely of national consultants&#13;
&#13;
A short list of consultants for services, estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
per contract, may be comprised entirely of national consultants in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Any Other Special Selection Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
The selection of an international procurement consulting firm will be based on CQ even&#13;
though the cost is estimated at above US$200,000. The volatile security conditions in&#13;
Iraq may not attract international consultants to work in Iraq. Short lists for the two large&#13;
consultancy contracts using QCBS method may have to include less than 6 firms due to&#13;
international consultants shying away from working in Iraq because of the volatile&#13;
security conditions in Iraq.&#13;

 1.      The project will be implemented by the Ministry        of Planning and Development&#13;
Cooperation (MOPDC) and the Iraqi Telecommunications          and Post Company (ITPC). Each&#13;
implementing agency will establish a Project Management        Team (PMT) to facilitate project&#13;
implementation. The project financial resources will    be managed within the framework of&#13;
the implementing agencies' financial management systems           in addition to World Bank&#13;
procurement and financial management procedures.            The Grant funds will be made&#13;
available to the implementing agencies which      will enter into contractual agreements with&#13;
contractors, consultants and vendor's for the procurement       and execution of the activities&#13;
financed under the project.&#13;
&#13;
2.      In view of the current security situation, it has  not been possible for Bank staff to&#13;
travel to Iraq. In lieu of this, the financial management  systems of MOPDC and ITPC were&#13;
assessed by a consulting firm. This assessment described     the organization structures of the&#13;
implementing agencies and covered the current         financial management practices at the&#13;
MOPDC and ITPC in order to identify the risks associated         with the control environment,&#13;
the accounting, reporting and auditing procedures     in place and propose actions to reduce&#13;
and manage such risks. These assessments found             that the systems in place at the&#13;
implementing agencies are based on principles and           procedures defined by the legal&#13;
framework and operational decrees applicable to the public     sector in Iraq. These procedures&#13;
prepare reports based on budget line expenditures            and include several layers of&#13;
authorization controls. In order to mitigate a number     of weaknesses identified in internal&#13;
control and reporting systems, the Bank will introduce        additional compensating control&#13;
measures for the project, including use of PMT,           appointment of Monitoring Agent,&#13;
appointment of external auditor with international experience,     and use of direct payments.&#13;
The financial management assessment project files          include a copy of the assessment&#13;
documentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.     Financial Management Risk Assessment&#13;
&#13;
3.      The financial management risk associated with       this operation is considered high.&#13;
Critical risk factors are: (i) ongoing insecurity,  which prevents on-site Bank supervision&#13;
and assessments, including financial assessments;      (ii) the Bank's limited knowledge of&#13;
Iraq's public financial management systems, controls,        and procedures; (iii) the limited&#13;
knowledge on the part of Iraqi authorities          of Bank policies and guidelines; (iv)&#13;
implementing agencies making available on a        timely basis financial resources to honor&#13;
payments below the value of US$10,000; (v) difficult             communication and flow of&#13;
information between worksites and the PMTs,             which could delay payments; (vi)&#13;
inefficiencies in Iraq's banking system that delay       payments and transfer of funds to&#13;
contractors, suppliers, or implementing agencies; and       (vii) variation orders that exceed&#13;
contingencies. Although the project design mitigates    to the extent possible these risks, the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                             Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
project will require close monitoring and supervision during implementation. A detailed&#13;
risk assessment may be found in Section VII below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III. Risk Mitigation Measures&#13;
&#13;
4.      The overall high risk will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional&#13;
controls and appropriate procedures.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The control risks will be partially mitigated by putting in place the following&#13;
measures: (a) the PMTs will verify and authorize payments under the project and verify&#13;
justifications for variation orders; (b) the PMTs will assign competent financial staff from&#13;
within the implementing agencies supported by financial management consultants; (c) the&#13;
implementing agencies will identify internal auditors from their internal audit departments&#13;
to track and verify the project activities; (d) disbursements by the Bank will be made by&#13;
direct payments to suppliers, contractors and consultants for amounts equal or above&#13;
US$10,000 and reimbursement of expenditures supported by full documentation for&#13;
smaller amounts; (e) the Monitoring Agent will review project expenditures and review&#13;
withdrawal applications f) training will be provided to the PMT staff and staff assigned to&#13;
the project during project launch.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple&#13;
parallel accounting system, which consists of basically a spread sheet applications, able  to&#13;
record all project expenditures and follow on the project commitments at any moment&#13;
during the implementation period and able to provide the needed data for the generation of&#13;
project management reports including the two sets of Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR)&#13;
and the aggregated annual project financial statements.. With respect to the auditing&#13;
arrangements, an external independent auditor with international experience will be&#13;
engaged to perform the project audits and issue an independent opinion on the project&#13;
financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
7.      All the above activities and procedures will be documented within a chapter of the&#13;
project implementation plan, which are in line with the Master Implementation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Financial Management Arrangements. Each implementing agency will be&#13;
responsible for the proper financial management of its own components as follows:          i)&#13;
maintain adequate FM arrangements throughout the project implementation, ii) maintain&#13;
separate accounting records and follow-up spreadsheets for the project, iii) approve all&#13;
payments related for the project, iv) submit copies of all supporting documents along   with&#13;
Withdrawal Applications to the Bank both for direct payments and reimbursement             v)&#13;
prepare its own set of quarterly FMR and submit them to the Bank within 45 days of      each&#13;
quarter-end. MOPDC and ITPC will each be responsible of preparing its own project&#13;
financial statements However, for auditing purposes, ITPC will also have to submit         its&#13;
financial statements to MOPDC for the aggregation of the annual project financial&#13;
statements. MOPDC will be responsible of preparing the aggregated annual project&#13;
financial statements and having them audited by a qualified external auditor acceptable to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           54&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                 Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Bank with scope and standards accepted           internationally. MOPDC will also be&#13;
responsible of submitting the audit report to the Bank within six months of year-end.&#13;
&#13;
9.      All payments will be subject to the applicable controls,   rules and regulations of the&#13;
implementing agencies in addition to the PMTs verifications    and approvals. These controls&#13;
are applied by the MOPDC as per the              circular issued by the MOF for budget&#13;
implementation and by ITPC as per its by-laws.     These controls will be applied to the grant&#13;
transactions and payments, even though the       grant funds are disbursed from outside the&#13;
budget.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Project Implementation Plan. The project procedures       and the parallel accounting&#13;
system that are managed by the PMTs are not reflected            in MOPDC or ITPC legal&#13;
framework. In order to ensure the accuracy      and completeness of the parallel system data&#13;
and to define the relation          between   all departments   involved with the project&#13;
implementation and thus facilitate the flow of project   information, the PMTs will prepare&#13;
the project implementation plan in line      with the Master Implementation Manual under&#13;
preparation by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV.     Project Reports&#13;
&#13;
11.     Project reports should be remitted to the Bank     following the agreed format and&#13;
frequency. The proposed format of the reports is in the    project files and was agreed upon&#13;
with the MOPDC and ITPC, representatives during negotiations.       These are the following:&#13;
&#13;
Quarterly Reports. Both MOPDC and ITPC will           generate Financial Monitoring Reports&#13;
(FMRs) and submit them to the Bank within 45 days         from the end of the period. These&#13;
reports submitted as part of the project progress report, or separately. The proposed format&#13;
of the reports is in the project files and was beagreed upon with the implementing agencies&#13;
representatives during negotiations The FMRs will include:&#13;
&#13;
     * Financial Reports: to include a cash flow statement,     beginning and ending project&#13;
        cash balances and an expenditure report     by activity or contract comparing actual&#13;
        and planned expenditures. Also, a narrative report  explaining major variances when&#13;
        compared to plan and the proposed corrective       actions should be included as an&#13;
        annex to the financial reports.&#13;
&#13;
     * Contracts Reports: this section will include    information on the contracts, showing&#13;
        category, amounts committed, financial status     against plan, including information&#13;
        on all authorized contract variations.&#13;
&#13;
Annual Reports. Aggregated audited project       financial statements (PFS) submitted to the&#13;
Bank. PFS will include:&#13;
&#13;
        V Statement of sources and utilization of funds, indicating   funds received and&#13;
           expenditures.&#13;
        V Appropriate schedules classifying project expenditures     by activity showing&#13;
           cumulative balances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            55&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         V Statement of payments made using statement of expenditures procedures, if&#13;
            allowed later by the Bank, as defined in the legal agreement.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Reporting to Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts&#13;
in respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF. Within ninety&#13;
(90) days of the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31),&#13;
the Bank will prepare, on a cash basis, an unaudited statement of receipts, disbursements,&#13;
and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor. Each such&#13;
statement will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency in which the ITF funds&#13;
will be maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred and eighty (180) days of&#13;
the completion of all disbursements relating to activities financed from the ITF, the Bank&#13;
will prepare on a cash basis an unaudited financial statement of receipts, disbursements,&#13;
and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The Bank will furnish to the donors:&#13;
&#13;
         (a)  on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of the&#13;
              ITF (including contributions, disbursements, and implementation progress) in&#13;
              the preceding six months; and&#13;
&#13;
         (b)  on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation from&#13;
              the Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control over&#13;
              cash-based financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
14.     The Bank will require a financial statement audit of the ITF to be performed by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors on an annual basis. The costs of such an audit, including the&#13;
internal costs of the Bank with respect to the audit, will be charged to the ITF. The Bank&#13;
will provide each donor with a copy of the auditor's report.&#13;
&#13;
15.     The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the donors. The&#13;
Bank will provide each donor to the ITF with semi-annual reports on its quarterly ex-post&#13;
evaluation of the activities undertaken by the Monitoring Agents. Within six months of&#13;
completion of the activities, or of full disbursement of the contributions, whichever comes&#13;
later, the Bank will provide a final progress report to each donor, together with a copy of&#13;
the independent review of the performance of the Monitoring Agents. Upon request by any&#13;
donor, the Bank will send to such donor the draft and final reports received by the Bank&#13;
from the Monitoring Agents on the activities financed by the contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
V.      Auditing Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
16.      An external independent auditor with intemational experience will be engaged to&#13;
perform the project audit and issue an independent opinion on the project financial&#13;
statements. The external audit report will encompass all of the project's activities and will&#13;
be presented in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, including&#13;
compliance with international standards on auditing. MOP will remit a project audit report&#13;
to the Bank not later than six months after year-end. The auditor selection process will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           56&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                  Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
launched directly after the grant agreement is signed.    . In addition to the audit reports, the&#13;
auditor will prepare a "management letter"     identifying any observations, comments, and&#13;
deficiencies in the system and controls that the auditor considers pertinent, and will provide&#13;
recommendations for their improvements. The audit           will cover the expenditures made&#13;
through direct payments as well as expenditures      reimbursed to the MOPDC and ITPC, in&#13;
terms of their substantiation and their eligibility and compliance with the grant agreement.&#13;
An escrow account will be used to pay the auditor    after the project closing date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VI.     Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
 17.    The proposed grant of US$55 million           will be disbursed over a period of&#13;
approximately three years. The Bank's strategy      in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and&#13;
strengthen institutional capacity by financing     operations that are implemented by Iraqi&#13;
ministries and other recipient entities. Trained    PMTs will facilitate implementation and&#13;
help ensure compliance with fiduciary and other      safeguards. PMTs will be employed and&#13;
paid by the implementing entity at regular salary   levels, thereby avoiding the disadvantages&#13;
of stand-alone Project Implementation Units that        can erode civil service institutional&#13;
capacity over the medium and long term. The         project will finance specialized technical&#13;
support in procurement, financial management,     and other areas as needed.&#13;
&#13;
18.     In addition, to ensure that project funds are   used for the purposes intended and to&#13;
help carry out project supervision, the Bank        will employ two independent firms as&#13;
Monitoring Agents. As a further compensating        control, especially given that the project&#13;
will be approved before the Monitoring Agents       are in place, disbursements will be made&#13;
primarily by direct payment by the Bank to the contractors,     consultants, and vendors. Once&#13;
authorized by the PMTs, direct payments will     be made by the World Bank directly into the&#13;
account of the contractor, consultant, or vendor   in a commercial bank capable of receiving&#13;
funds transferred from the international banking system.&#13;
&#13;
19.    The project management component and              payments below the threshold of&#13;
US$10,000 normally will be made through           payments by the Recipient from its own&#13;
resources. These payments made from the Recipient's        own resources will be reimbursed,&#13;
on a periodic basis, by the Bank to         the MOPDC-PMT and the ITPC-PMT upon&#13;
presentation of relevant supporting documents,    proof of payment and a signed withdrawal&#13;
application. The PMTs staff and the main' financial   counterparts from the MOPDC and the&#13;
ITPC will be subject to intensive training in the Bank's  disbursement procedures.&#13;
&#13;
20.    Use of Statements of Expenditures. Initially,        supporting documentation will be&#13;
provided to the Bank for all requests to disburse   funds under the Grant. The Bank has the&#13;
option to allow expenditures under US$10,000        to be made by means of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). If SOEs are allowed the             supporting documentation will be&#13;
maintained at the respective PMT of each implementing          agency and made available for&#13;
review by Bank representatives upon request;     any documentation relating to SOEs will be&#13;
retained for up to one year from the date the Bank receives   the last grant audit report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              57&#13;

                                              The Bank gained some knou ledge on Iraqi PFMI&#13;
                                              systems by appointing a consulting firm to assess&#13;
Limited knowledge of financial                financial management systems at several Iraqi&#13;
management systems of the Iraqi          H    ministries. Bank staff also conducted their own&#13;
public sector and the                         interviews with Iraqi officials in Amman and&#13;
implementing agencies                         reviewed PFM system documentation. Further&#13;
                                              knowledge was gained from an audit report by an&#13;
                                              international audit firm&#13;
                                              Each PMT will have qualified staff including&#13;
                                              financial manager and finance officer. The teams&#13;

                                              Bank also hired a consulting firm to prepare a&#13;
                                              master implementation manual to be used by all&#13;

where a seminar on Bank policies          and procedures will be presented.             A high level of&#13;
supervision will be required initially     in order to ensure that the finance        champions within&#13;
each PMT and its implementing          agency are well-trained in the use       of Bank guidelines and&#13;
procedures. Where security conditions        make travel to Iraq impossible for           Bank staff, the&#13;
Bank will employ an independent         firm as Monitoring Agent that will           operate in Iraq and&#13;
support the Bank in carrying out its     supervision function.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
             Annex 8: Environmental and Social Safeguard Framework (ESSAF)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I.     Objectives&#13;
&#13;
1.     The Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF)&#13;
provides general policies, guidelines, codes of practice and procedures to be integrated into&#13;
the implementation of the initial phase of World Bank-supported emergency reconstruction&#13;
operations in Iraq. This Framework has been developed to ensure compliance with the&#13;
World Bank's safeguard policies under the current conditions in Iraq. The objective of the&#13;
ESSAF is to ensure that activities under the proposed reconstruction operations will&#13;
address the following issues:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       *4.     Protect human health;&#13;
&#13;
       *:      Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;&#13;
&#13;
               *Minimize environmental degradation as a result of either individual&#13;
                subprojects or their cumulative effects;&#13;
&#13;
       *.      Minimize impacts on cultural property; and&#13;
&#13;
       4-      Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.    General Principles&#13;
&#13;
2.     Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed relief and reconstruction&#13;
operations and the related need for providing immediate assistance, while at the same time&#13;
ensuring due diligence in managing potential environmental and social risks, the ESSAF is&#13;
based on the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
    4 The proposed operations will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs of&#13;
       which may not be known at appraisal. To ensure effective application of the World&#13;
       Bank's safeguard policies, the ESSAF provides guidance on the approach to be&#13;
       taken during implementation for the selection and design of subprojects and the&#13;
       planning of mitigation measures;&#13;
&#13;
    4* Environmental category 'A' subprojects are not expected in the first year's&#13;
       subprojects. If any do occur, EAs for specific subprojects will be prepared during&#13;
       implementation, instead of before appraisal. Corrective measures in the form of an&#13;
       Environmental Management Plan will be built into either the emergency project or&#13;
       a future lending operation. The above is in accordance with paragraph 13 of OP&#13;
       4.01 and paragraph 5 of BP 4.01;&#13;
&#13;
    4 No resettlement issues are expected in any of the FY04 operations for the first&#13;
       year's subprojects. If any do occur, Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), and/or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          60&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Emergency Private Sector Deyelopment    I Project                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Resettlement Policy Frameworks          for specific subprojects will be        prepared.&#13;
         However, these RAPs can be prepared       during implementation, provided a     waiver on&#13;
         the submission of RAPs prior      to appraisal is given by the MD.    The waiver would&#13;
         also specify a timetable for the    preparation of the RAPs, in accordance       with the&#13;
         requirements of OP 4.12, during implementation;&#13;
&#13;
     *   The proposed emergency reconstruction          operations will finance feasibility     and&#13;
         detailed design studies for these       subsequent investments, which       will include&#13;
         environmental assessments and      social studies as required by World   Bank safeguard&#13;
         policies;&#13;
&#13;
     4* Project design and subproject    selection will aim at maintaining   regional balance and&#13;
         equity among ethnic religious groups,     considering variations in population    density.&#13;
         Employment opportunities within      the projects will be available on  an equal basis to&#13;
         all, on the basis of professional    competence, irrespective of gender      or ethnic or&#13;
         religious group. In all projects which    require consultations with local communities&#13;
         or beneficiaries, consultations will  be conducted to elicit the views  of the male and&#13;
         female population; and&#13;
&#13;
     *   Consultation and disclosure requirements        will be simplified to meet the special&#13;
        needs of these operations. This ESSAF       will be disclosed in the sector ministries and&#13;
        other public places in Iraq and in the  World Bank InfoShop.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III.    Environmental and Social Screening         and Assessment Framework         (ESSAF)&#13;
&#13;
3.      This ESSAF has been developed           specifically for these proposed     operations to&#13;
ensure due diligence, to avoid   causing harm or exacerbating      social tensions, and to ensure&#13;
consistent treatment of social and    environmental issues by all donors      and the Governing&#13;
Council of Iraq. The purpose of     this Framework is also to assist   the Project Implementing&#13;
Agencies in screening all the subprojects     for their likely social and environmental   impacts,&#13;
identifying documentation and preparation      requirements and prioritizing the investments.&#13;
&#13;
4.      OP 4.01 Environmental Assessments           Most of the proposed subprojects     are likely&#13;
to focus on the repair, rehabilitation,    reconstruction and upgrading     (where necessary) of&#13;
damaged buildings, roads, railways,     bridges and infrastructure of critical importance. This&#13;
would include power generation and       distribution, agricultural infrastructure, irrigation and&#13;
drainage networks, and rehabilitation    of primary and secondary schools.      Support will also&#13;
be provided for mitigation       measures related to the rehabilitation/restoration         of the&#13;
Mesopotamian Marshes and Shatt       El Arab. The work in these areas     will be done under OP&#13;
4.01 and it is not anticipated that OP  4.04 on natural habitats will be triggered.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Considering the nature and magnitude         of potential environmental impacts      from&#13;
relatively limited scale and magnitude    of reconstruction works, the proposed    operations are&#13;
likely to be classified as category    'B'. The requirement to carry out       an Environmental&#13;
Analysis as part of project preparation     can be waived but, for subprojects     with potential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                61&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
adverse impacts, a limited Environmental Analysis will be done during project&#13;
implementation. At the same time, prior to appraisal the implementing agency will agree&#13;
to apply the following minimum standards during implementation: inclusion of standard&#13;
environmental codes of practice (ECOP) in the repair and reconstruction bid documents of&#13;
all subprojects; review and oversight of any major reconstruction works by specialists;&#13;
implementation of environmentally and socially sound options for disposal of debris; and&#13;
provisions for adequate budget and satisfactory institutional arrangements for monitoring&#13;
effective implementation.&#13;
&#13;
6.      OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. The need for involuntary resettlement or land&#13;
acquisition in specific subproject areas will only be known during project implementation,&#13;
when site-specific plans are available.        Therefore subprojects will be screened for&#13;
applicability of the resettlement policy and any subprojects involving involuntary&#13;
resettlement or land acquisition will only be approved after preparation of a resettlement&#13;
plan acceptable to the Bank. Several issues will increase the complexity of land acquisition&#13;
- the lack of reliable land record systems, and the inability of people loosing land to either&#13;
document ownership or be physically present to make their claims for eligibility. The&#13;
safeguards framework will therefore include procedures for identifying eligible project-&#13;
affected people, calculating and delivering compensation, and mechanisms for land dispute&#13;
grievance redress.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Although land disputes between private parties and refugees from war, or natural&#13;
disasters are not covered by OP 4.12, the policy does cover those displaced by the project's&#13;
activities.  Even for those not covered by the policy, and to ensure effective poverty&#13;
reduction, it is good practice for the borrower to undertake a social assessment and&#13;
implement measures to minimize and mitigate adverse social impacts, particularly on poor&#13;
and vulnerable groups. Well documented consultation mechanisms will be required to&#13;
establish eligibility for compensation. Absent refugees who later claim compensation will&#13;
require clear legal remedies to resolve or adjudicate disputes.&#13;
&#13;
8.      OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples. Ethnicity is only one of many factors determining&#13;
vulnerability in the present Iraqi context. Local circumstances vary too greatly to make&#13;
generalizations. However, initial discussions with anthropologists and sociologists familiar&#13;
with the country found that the presence of the five defining characteristics normally used&#13;
(OD 4.20 paragraph 5) are inconclusive in Iraqi's context, where the ethnic group concept&#13;
is analytically problematic. According to social scientists familiar with ground realities in&#13;
Iraq, selecting a sub-section of the society for special attention in accordance with the&#13;
requirements of OD 4.20 (e.g.,          separate plans for different groups) would be&#13;
counterproductive and could even end up escalating the conflict within and between&#13;
communities.&#13;
&#13;
9.      In light of the above situation, a potential vulnerability assessment of all affected&#13;
groups is planned to ensure effective consultations and culturally appropriate benefits for&#13;
each group, instead of focusing only on groups defined as "indigenous peoples". As part of&#13;
this analysis, subproject preparation will assess the vulnerability of different ethnic groups&#13;
in particular project contexts (in terms of potential exclusion from project benefits, negative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             62&#13;

Emergency Private Sector Development   I Project                               Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
project impacts, and the need         for specific culturally compatible      mechanisms for&#13;
participation), and will incorporate    adequate measures to address     such vulnerability in&#13;
project design. While some specific      cases may justify stand-alone    Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plans (IPDP)        such as in the case of the     people in the Mesopotamian&#13;
Marshlands, these cases      can only be determined after       social analysis of potential&#13;
vulnerability and careful judgment   as required by the OD 4.20.&#13;
&#13;
 10.     OPN 11.03 Cultural Property.        The FY04 operations may pose      limited risks of&#13;
damaging cultural property,    assuming that they will not   include large-scale excavations,&#13;
movement of earth or demolition.     Nevertheless, projects and subprojects   will be reviewed&#13;
for their potential impact on   cultural property and clear  procedures will be required     for&#13;
identification, protection of cultural   property from theft, and   treatment of discovered&#13;
artifacts, and will be included in standard bidding documents.   While not damaging cultural&#13;
property, subproject preparation   may later identify and include  assistance for preservation&#13;
of historic or archeological     sites.    If these opportunities occur,     cultural property&#13;
management plans would be     prepared for those subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
11.     OP 4.37 Safety of Dams.     There are about 50 dams over   15 meters high, which will&#13;
trigger the policy if included in the operations. "However, because   of local site conditions,&#13;
even restoring smaller, earthen  dams and linked irrigation infrastructure  (partly abandoned,&#13;
damaged or destroyed by civil        unrest and war) will require    application of standard&#13;
engineering safety codes, inspection   and evaluation of their safety  status, and preparation&#13;
and implementation of operation     and maintenance procedures.     Decisions on dam safety&#13;
requirements will be made with   the concurrence of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
12.     OP 7.50 Projects on International     Waterways. The two major       rivers in Iraq, the&#13;
Tigris and Euphrates, are shared   with neighboring countries. However,      no water sharing&#13;
agreements exist between Syria,    Turkey, Iran and Iraq. Components       affecting waters in&#13;
riparian neighbors will trigger   the policy and project components      will be screened to&#13;
identify riparian issues and to  ensure adequate notification, as required under the policy.&#13;
Decisions on actions and requirements    will be made with the concurrence   of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV.     Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
13.     The selection, design, contracting,  monitoring and evaluation  of subprojects will be&#13;
consistent with the following guidelines,  codes of practice and requirements.   The Coalition&#13;
Provisional Authority (CPA)    will confirm that areas to be  accessed during reconstruction&#13;
and rehabilitation activitieshave been de-mined. The safeguard      screening and mitigation&#13;
process will include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        *   A list of negative characteristics rendering a proposed subproject   ineligible for&#13;
            support, Attachment 1;&#13;
&#13;
        +   A proposed checklist of likely   environment and social impacts    to be filled out&#13;
            for each subproject or group of subprojects, Attachment 2;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             63&#13;

Emergency Private Sector Development IProject                                Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        *   Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation,&#13;
            Attachment 3;&#13;
&#13;
        *   Procedures for the protection of cultural property, including the chance&#13;
            discovery of archaeological artifacts, unrecorded graveyards and burial sites,&#13;
            Attachment 4;&#13;
&#13;
        *   Relevant elements of the codes of practice for the prevention and mitigation of&#13;
            potential environmental impacts, Attachment 5; and&#13;
&#13;
        *   A sample Environmental Safeguards procedures for Inclusion in the Technical&#13;
            Specifications of Contracts, Attachment 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
V.     Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
14.    A number of Ministries will act as the implementing agencies for the proposed&#13;
operations, including the Ministries of Environment, Transport, Housing and Construction,&#13;
Electricity, Water Resources, Municipalities and Public Works, and the mayoralty of&#13;
Baghdad.    Each Ministry will be responsible for applying the safeguard screening and&#13;
mitigation requirements to its own subprojects. Within each Ministry, a Safeguards Focal&#13;
Point (SFP) will be identified with responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the&#13;
Framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VI.     Capacity-Building and Monitoring of Safeguard Framework Implementation&#13;
&#13;
15.    As part of the capacity-building to be provided for implementation of the proposed&#13;
operations, the Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministries will&#13;
also receive training in ESSAF's application.&#13;
&#13;
16.    To assist in this capacity-building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review&#13;
of the ESSAF's application, the World Bank and subsequently the Governing Council of&#13;
Iraq (GCI) will contract specialist services for environmental and social safeguards. During&#13;
supervision of these operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the&#13;
ESSAF, and recommend additional strengthening, if required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VII.    Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
&#13;
17.     This ESSAF will be shared with the CPA, with the concerned nongovernmental&#13;
organizations and development partners of Iraq's reconstruction.     It will be disclosed in&#13;
Arabic and English by the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation on behalf of&#13;
the GCI in Baghdad, Basrah, and Mosul, and it will also be made available at the World&#13;
Bank's InfoShop. Relevant subproject specific safeguard documents/mitigation plans&#13;
prepared subsequently will also be disclosed.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The proposed operations will support a number of feasibility and detailed design&#13;
studies for future infrastructure investments for which World Bank safeguard policies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          64&#13;

 Emergency Private Sector Development     I Project                               Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 relating to consultation and disclosure         will apply.    In particular, for environmental&#13;
 Category A and B investments7       proposed for future operations, the    implementing agency&#13;
 will consult project-affected     groups and local nongovernmental         organizations on the&#13;
 project's environmental and social     aspects, and will take their views    into account.   The&#13;
 implementing agency will initiate        these consultations as early      as possible, and for&#13;
 meaningful consultations, will      provide relevant material in      a timely manner prior to&#13;
 consultation, in a form and language(s)    that are understandable and accessible  to the groups&#13;
 being consulted.&#13;
&#13;
 19.     For Category A projects, the implementing       agency will consult these groups at least&#13;
 twice: (a) shortly after the environmental    screening and prior to finalizationof the terms of&#13;
 reference for the Environmental Inpact      Assessment (EIA); and (b) once a    draft EIA report&#13;
 is prepared. For the initial consultation,   the implementing agency will provide    a summary&#13;
 of the proposed project's objectives,   description, and potential impacts.   For both Category&#13;
 A and B projects, the implementing      agency will provide these groups     with a summary of&#13;
 the EIA report's conclusions.      In addition, the implementing     agency will make the draft&#13;
 reports  publicly   available to     project-affected    groups    and local   nongovernmental&#13;
 organizations.&#13;

          Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements and Compensation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I.       Objectives&#13;
&#13;
1.       Resettlement and land acquisition will be kept to a minimum, and will       be carried out in&#13;
accordance with these guidelines. Subproject proposals that would      require demolishing houses or&#13;
acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid      their impacts through&#13;
alternative alignments.   Proposals that require more than minor expansion along         rights of way&#13;
should be carefully reviewed.      No land or asset acquisition may take place outside of these&#13;
guidelines. A format for a Land Acquisition Assessment Data Sheet is attached as      Attachment 3(i).&#13;
&#13;
2.       These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate        negatively affected&#13;
persons to ensure that they will be assisted to improve, or at leastto restore, their living standards,&#13;
income earning or production capacity to pre-project levels regardless  of their land tenure status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.      Categorization&#13;
&#13;
3.       Based on the number of persons that may be affected by the         project, Project Affected&#13;
People (PAPs) and the magnitude of impacts, projects will be categorized    as follows:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) Projects that will affect more than 200 PAPs due to land acquisition       and/or physical&#13;
             relocation and where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must       be produced. If the&#13;
             RAP cannot be prepared prior to project appraisal, a waiver      can be provided by the&#13;
             World Bank Managing Director (MD) in consultation with                  the Resettlement&#13;
             Committee. In such cases, the TT should agree with the Borrower        on a timetable for&#13;
             preparation of the RAP.&#13;
&#13;
         (b) Projects that will affect less than 200 persons require the following documentation:&#13;
             (i) a land acquisition assessment, (ii) the minutes or record of            consultations&#13;
             which assess the compensation claimed and agreement                reached, and (iii) a&#13;
             record of the receipt of the compensation, or voluntary donation,               by those&#13;
             affected (see below).&#13;
&#13;
         (c) Projects that are not expected to have any land acquisition      or any other significant&#13;
             adverse social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and improved&#13;
             livelihoods are expected from such interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III.     Eligibility&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    72&#13;

&#13;
         (c) those whose claim to land and water     resources or building/structures do not    fall within&#13;
             (a) and (b) above, are eligible to resettlement  assistance to restore their livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV.      Acquisition of Productive Assets and Compensation&#13;
&#13;
5.       PAPs are eligible for replacement   costs for lost assets as described below:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) Voluntary contributions. Individuals     may elect to voluntarily contribute land    or assets&#13;
             provided the persons making such contributions       do so willingly and are informed that&#13;
             they have the right to refuse such contributions;  and&#13;
&#13;
         (b) Contributionsagainst compensation.        A contributor/asset loser considered      "affected"&#13;
             will be eligible for compensation and   other necessary assistance.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Voluntary contribution should be clearly   documented to confirm the voluntary       nature of the&#13;
transition. The documentation should specify      that the land is free of any squatters,   encroachers or&#13;
other claims. A format is shown in      Attachment 3(i), which includes a Schedule      for assessing any&#13;
compensation claimed and the agreement      reached.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
V.       Compensation Principles&#13;
&#13;
7.       The project implementation agencies     will ensure timely provision of the    following means&#13;
of compensation to affected peoples:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) Project affected peoples losing   access to a portion of their land or      other productive&#13;
             assets with the remaining assets being   economically viable are entitled to   compensation&#13;
             at a replacement cost for that portion   of land or assets lost to them. Compensation      for&#13;
             the lost assets will be made according to the  following principles:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             (i)   replacement land with an equally        productive plot, cash or other       equivalent&#13;
                   productive assets;&#13;
&#13;
             (ii)  materials and assistance to fully replace  solid structures that will be demolished;&#13;
&#13;
             (iii) replacement of damaged or lost    crops and trees, at market value;&#13;
&#13;
            (iv)   other acceptable in-kind compensation;&#13;
&#13;
            (v)    in case of cash compensation,     the delivery of compensation should       be made in&#13;
                   public, i.e., at the Community Meeting;    and&#13;
&#13;
            (vi)   in case of physical relocation, provision  of civic infrastructure at the resettlement&#13;
                   sites.&#13;
&#13;
        (b) Project affected peoples losing    access to a portion of their land or      other economic&#13;
            assets rendering the remainder economically          non-viable will have the options        of&#13;
            compensation for the entire asset    by provision of alternative land,    cash or equivalent&#13;
            productive asset, according to  the principles in (a) i-iv above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                        73&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Private Sector Development I Project                                         Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VI.      Consultation Process&#13;
&#13;
8.       The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets&#13;
located in a proposed subproject area are consulted.       Community meetings will be held in each&#13;
affected district and village to inform the local population of their rights to compensation and&#13;
options available in accordance with these Guidelines. The Minutes of the community meetings&#13;
shall reflect the discussions held, agreements reached, and include details of the agreement, based&#13;
on the format provided in Attachment 3(ii).&#13;
&#13;
9.       The implementing agency shall provide a copy of the Minutes to affected people and&#13;
confirm in discussions with each of them, their requests and preferences for compensation,&#13;
agreements reached, and any eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded in the posted project&#13;
documentation and be available for inspection during supervision.&#13;
&#13;
Subproject Approval&#13;
&#13;
10.      In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the implementing&#13;
agency shall:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         (a) not approve the subproject unless satisfactory compensation has been agreed between&#13;
             the affected person and the local community; and&#13;
&#13;
         (b) not allow works to start until the compensation has been delivered in a satisfactory&#13;
              manner to the affected persons.&#13;
&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
&#13;
11.      Initially, all complaints should be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local&#13;
community/village/district level.    If this fails, complaints and grievances on these Guidelines,&#13;
implementation of the agreements recorded in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged&#13;
irregularity in carrying out the project can also be addressed by the affected peoples or their&#13;
representative at the municipal or district level. If this also fails, the complaint may be submitted to&#13;
the relevant implementing agency for consideration.&#13;
&#13;
Verification&#13;
&#13;
12.      The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements of compensation and evidence of&#13;
compensation made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising engineers, who&#13;
will maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when they undertake&#13;
reviews and post-project assessment.        This process shall be specified in all relevant project&#13;
documents, including details of the relevant authority for complaints at the municipal/district or&#13;
implementing agency level.&#13;

                                                                                         Attachment 4&#13;
&#13;
                                  Protection of Cultural Property&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.     Cultural property include monuments, structures, works of art, or sites    of significance points&#13;
of view, and are defined as sites and structures having archaeological,     historical, architectural, or&#13;
religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values. This includes   cemeteries, graveyards&#13;
and graves.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The initial phase of the proposed emergency reconstruction operations pose limited       risks of&#13;
damaging     cultural property since subprojects will largely consist of small          investments in&#13;
community infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction of existing         structures,&#13;
and minor public works. Further, the list of negative subproject attributes, which       would make a&#13;
subproject ineligible for support (Attachment 1), includes any activity that would     adversely impact&#13;
cultural property. Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification,    protection from theft,&#13;
and treatment of discovered artifacts should be followed and            included in standard bidding&#13;
documents as provided in Attachment 6.&#13;
&#13;
Chance Find Procedures&#13;
&#13;
3.       Chance find procedures will be used as follows:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find;&#13;
         (b) Delineate the discovered site or area;&#13;
         (c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects.            In cases of&#13;
             removable antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the&#13;
             responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over;&#13;
         (d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible    local authorities&#13;
             and the Ministry ofCulture immediately (within 24 hours or less);&#13;
         (e) Responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture would be            in charge of&#13;
             protecting and preserving the site before deciding on subsequent                appropriate&#13;
             procedures. This would require a preliminary evaluation of the             findings to be&#13;
             performed by the archeologists of the Ministry of Culture (within          72 hours). The&#13;
             significance and importance of the findings should be assessed according     to the various&#13;
             criteria relevant to cultural heritage; those include the aesthetic, historic, scientific or&#13;
             research, social and economic values;&#13;
         (f) Decisions on how to handle the finding shall be taken   by the responsible authorities and&#13;
             the Ministry of Culture.     This could include changes in the layout (such as when&#13;
             finding an irremovable remain of cultural or archeological importance)        conservation,&#13;
             preservation, restoration and salvage;&#13;
         (g) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management          of the finding&#13;
             shall be communicated in writing by the Ministry of Culture; and&#13;
         (h) Construction work could resume only after permission        is given from the responsible&#13;
             local authorities and the Ministry of Culture concerning safeguard of   the heritage.&#13;
&#13;
4.       These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts,     when&#13;
applicable, and as proposed in section 1.5 of Attachment 6.        During project supervision, the Site&#13;
Engineer shall monitor the above regulations relating to the treatment             of any chance find&#13;
encountered are observed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       78&#13;

             performed by the archeologists of the Ministry of Culture (within         72 hours).    The&#13;
             significance and importance of the findings should be assessed according      to the various&#13;
             criteria relevant to cultural heritage, including the aesthetic, historic,     scientific or&#13;
             research, social and economic values.&#13;

in the area.&#13;
&#13;
31.      All arrangements for transportation    during construction including      provision, maintenance,&#13;
dismantling and clearing    debris, where necessary,    will be considered incidental      to the work and&#13;
should be planned and implemented      by the contractor as approved    and directed by the Engineer.&#13;
&#13;
32.      Vehicle/machinery and equipment        operations, maintenance     and refueling shall be carried&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           Annex 9: Telecommunications Sector Policy Development in Iraq&#13;
&#13;
I.      Basic Principles of the Telecommunications Sector Policy in Iraq&#13;
&#13;
1       General policy objectives&#13;
&#13;
The   main goal      of in     the sector is to extend affordable,           reliable access   to&#13;
telecommunications and Intemet services for Iraqi people from all sectors of society.&#13;
&#13;
2       Market structure&#13;
&#13;
The telecommunications and Intemet services will develop towards competitive provision&#13;
of services by multiple operators. Laws, licenses and regulation will be designed to further&#13;
competitive provision on a level playing field. The sector will operate under the policy&#13;
guidance of the Ministry of Communications and the oversight of an independent regulator.&#13;
&#13;
3       Role of the sector Ministry&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Communications will develop the general sector policy in consultation&#13;
with the regulator, businesses, the public, and telecommunications operators.                After&#13;
government     acceptance     of the initial    policy, the Ministry will         draft requisite&#13;
telecommunications, Intemet and postal laws. The policy will largely be implemented by&#13;
the regulator, under the law, in some cases in conjunction with the Ministry (including&#13;
areas such as licensing and access programs). The exact role of the Ministry in licensing is&#13;
an issue for discussion.&#13;
&#13;
4       Role of sector regulator&#13;
&#13;
A regulator will be created that will act as the primary instrument for implementing&#13;
telecommunications law, according to the Ministry's policy. In this regard, the regulator's&#13;
function will be to foster competitive provision, and to prevent market failure.&#13;
&#13;
5       Transition for ITPC and InternetServices Company&#13;
&#13;
The Iraqi Telecommunications and Post Company (ITPC) and Internet Services Company&#13;
will   be  transformed      into  independent     and  separate    corporate     entities  in the&#13;
telecommunications and postal fields, to allow a level playing field among all sector&#13;
participants, management decision-making autonomy and flexibility. It's the government&#13;
intent to end its role in the provision of services and to leave it to the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
6       Universal access&#13;
&#13;
The    goal of universal       access in Iraq will      be to ensure equitable          access  to&#13;
telecommunications and postal infrastructure, regardless of income, gender, ethnic group or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               88&#13;

&#13;
 disability. The appropriate   mechanisms will be     developed and implemented       for meeting&#13;
 universal access goals.&#13;
&#13;
 7       Human resources&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry will play   an important role, in coordination  with other parts of government,   in&#13;
developing programs for      training and education      in the area of human       resources for&#13;
development and use    of telecommunications     and Internet services.&#13;
&#13;
II.      Actions taken so far&#13;

            The Emergency Private Sector Development
            Project for Iraq represents the first phase of a proposed
            series of interventions within the comprehensive private
            sector development strategy-to help implement a subset of
            the main pillars that can be done given the current security
            situation and the Bank's comparative advantage. Its
            objective is to lay the foundation by addressing certain key
            priorities in institutional capacity building and essential
            communications infrastructure to help foster the development
            of the private and financial sectors. A secondary objective
            of the project is to generate job creation through the
            development of the private sector.
