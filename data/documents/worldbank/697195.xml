RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1         In recent years participatory grassroots projects have increasingly become&#13;
the major thrust of Bolivia's rural development strategy. Experiences in the Mizque and&#13;
Zudanes provinces, where NGOs have executed projects with high participatory content,&#13;
have fostered project ownership by the beneficiary communities and investment&#13;
sustainability. Government intends to replicate these experiences on a national scale.&#13;
Within this context, it has since 1993 engaged in a decentralization effort allowing&#13;
Municipalities to determine their political, financial, and developmental course.&#13;
1.2         Through a series of administrative reforms, such as the creation of the&#13;
National Secretariat of Rural Development (Secretaria Nacional de Desarrollo Rural,&#13;
SNDR) and the issuance of the Popular Participation Law (Ley de Participaci6n Popular,&#13;
LPP), Government has started to tap the merits of local self-determination to promote&#13;
development. As an initial step, SNDR has implemented a pilot project in nine selected&#13;
provinces to test the participatory approach for rural development. This pilot operation&#13;
has been financed by an IDA Project Preparation Facility and Japanese Trust Funds. The&#13;
proposed project is based on the experience of the pilot project and other SNDR activities.&#13;
1.3         Project identification took place in December 1993. In February 1994,&#13;
Government requested IDA support for the proposed project. Project preparation&#13;
mnissions visited Bolivia in April and July 1994. Pre-appraisal took place in November&#13;
1994, appraisal in February 1995 and negotiations in June 1995. IFAD participated in the&#13;
project's preparation and appraisal missions. COTESU (Swiss Technical Cooperation)&#13;
participated in the project's pre-appraisal. Both organizations would participate in project&#13;
implementation as financing partners.&#13;
2. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. The Macro-Economic Situation&#13;
2.1         Faced with a severe economic crisis in de mid-1980s, Bolivia was one of&#13;
the first countries in Latin America to adopt a far reaching economic program aimed at&#13;
restoring price stability and restructuring the economy. The economic reform program&#13;
combined comprehensive structural reforms with tight monetary policy and a program to&#13;
reduce debt and debt service payments. This has resulted in restoring price stability and&#13;
economic growth--real GDP growth has been an annual four percent in recent years.&#13;
2.2          Bolivia's economy remains fragile. The 1994 fiscal deficit--3.2 percent of&#13;
GDP--was, however, significantly lower than the 1993 deficit. The external position&#13;
remains weak--although the 12-month current account deficit (after official transfers)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
decreased to 5 percent of GDP in 1994. Moreover, Bolivia remains vulnerable to&#13;
exogenous shocks--most importantly changes in external aid and in international&#13;
commodity prices.&#13;
2.3          The modest economic growth achieved in the past five years has not&#13;
significantly reduced poverty levels. Over half of the population remains poor and the&#13;
poverty gap has widened. The modest growth level can in part be explained by a decade-&#13;
long decline in the net accumulation of capital stock. While private investment has&#13;
recovered it remains at a modest level of seven percent of GDP. Public investment has&#13;
been relatively high--about ten percent of GDP--yet to a large extend, resources have been&#13;
poorly allocated and invested inefficiently.&#13;
2.4          The new Government came into power in August 1993 and is committed&#13;
to macroeconomic stability and a set of reforms intended to accelerate growth and reduce&#13;
poverty. The Government has acted aggressively--and so far successfully-- to correct the&#13;
fiscal equilibrium which emerged in 1993. The inflation rate has declined from 10 percent&#13;
in 1993 to 8.5 percent at the end of 1994. While Government must continue to&#13;
consolidate macroeconomic stability, the most crucial challenge remains to reduce poverty&#13;
in light of the fact that approximately 70 percent of the total population lives under&#13;
conditions of poverty. This challenge is even more pronounced in the rural areas where&#13;
over 95 percent of the households are poor.&#13;
B. The Rural Sector&#13;
2.5          The vastness of Bolivia's territory (1.09 million kMn2), and the cultural&#13;
diversity of its population, encompassing several ethnic groups and languages, have&#13;
shaped a society marked by sharp contrasts particularly evident in the rural sector.&#13;
The Natural Resources Base.&#13;
2.6          National territory has three ecologically distinct regions: the Highland&#13;
Plateau (Altiplano) in the west, the inter-Andean Valleys in the center, and the flat tropical&#13;
Lowlands in the East. Highland conditions are especially severe with high risk of crop&#13;
failures due to drought, hail and frost. The climate of the Valleys is milder. Much of the&#13;
dense tropical forests of the humid tropical Lowlands have been cleared for agriculture or&#13;
livestock grazing.&#13;
2.7          Good agricultural land, found mainly in valley bottoms, lake shores and&#13;
alluvial plains, is scarce. In the Lowlands, large tracts suitable for livestock have&#13;
extremely low population densities. Of the total cultivable land area (about five million&#13;
ha), less than 40 percent is under crops in any given year. The balance is either left fallow&#13;
to restore fertility, or used as grasslands. Forests and woodlands comprise roughly half&#13;
the country's territory, and grasslands about one-third.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
2.8          While Bolivia is a sparsely populated country, with 6.5 inhabitants per km2,&#13;
nearly 75 percent of the country's rural population live in the Highland Plateaus and the&#13;
Valleys, representing 38 percent of the land area. This concentration has led to over-&#13;
exploitation of natural resources, resulting in lost vegetative cover, accelerated soil&#13;
erosion and declining soil fertility.&#13;
2.9          Impoverished conditions and limited alternatives have induced many,&#13;
usually young, people of the rural Valleys and Highland Plateau to emigrate. Many move&#13;
to the urban centers seeking improved employment opportunities and access to better&#13;
public services. Others have resettled in the Lowlands. Still others have relocated,&#13;
permanently but more often temporarily, to the tropical Valleys to work in coca&#13;
production. As a result, while the rural population has stagnated (annual growth rate of&#13;
0.09 percent), the urban population has expanded at an annual rate of four percent; with&#13;
the share of the rural population falling from 59 percent of the total population in 1976 to&#13;
48 percent in 1992.&#13;
The Rural Economy&#13;
2.10         Agriculture is the primary economic activity for 80 percent of the rural&#13;
families. Nearly four-fifths of these farm famnilies, especially those located in the Andean&#13;
Ilighland Plateau and Valleys, engage in traditional farming. A capital-intensive sub-&#13;
sector thrives in the tropical Lowlands. The agricultural sector accounted for a fifth of&#13;
national GDP and employed 45 percent of the labor force in 1992. Legal agricultural&#13;
exports have fluctuated between US$160 million and US$230 million over the last few&#13;
years, representing between 20 and 25 percent of the country's export earnings.&#13;
2.11         Since 1987, real annual sectoral growth of 1.5 percent has originated&#13;
almost exclusively from the modem export-oriented Lowland sub-sector, whose expansion&#13;
is based on area increases for soybean production. In contrast, the traditional sub-sector&#13;
has not responded to the recent adjustments in relative prices and has had negligible&#13;
growth. Relatively high production and marketing costs, attributable to rudimentary&#13;
technologies, poor market opportunities and a persistent absence of support services&#13;
(especially roads and agricultural extension), have depressed the sub-sector's&#13;
performance.&#13;
2.12         Traditional agriculture, providing 65 percent of the gross value of legal&#13;
agricultural production, is conducted on small farms - all under five ha and most under&#13;
one ha. Maize, potatoes, barley, and quinoa are the important crops. In addition,&#13;
traditional farm families usually have a small herd of livestock, including llama, alpaca and&#13;
cows. Traditional farmers use rudimentary technology, rely on family labor and make&#13;
limited capital investments. As a result, for the past twenty years, crop yields have&#13;
stagnated at very low levels.&#13;
2.13         In the Highland Plateau, traditional farming is practiced under harsh natural&#13;
conditions, where frosts and droughts frequently threaten harvests. In the Valleys, where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the climate is more favorable, there is some crop intensification under irrigation. In the&#13;
tropical regions of the Valleys, small farmers produce coca. Throughout the sub-sector,&#13;
weak infrastructure aggravates the dispersion of its population, impeding market&#13;
development for produce, services and labor among sub-regions and with urban centers.&#13;
2.14        Having been largely by-passed by economic development and&#13;
modernization, traditional farmers and indigenous peoples are among the country's&#13;
poorest. Income derived from farm market sales does not cover the needs of most small&#13;
farm families. Consequently, many households diversify their activities to include cottage&#13;
industries, seasonal migration and petty commerce. Others send members to the cities to&#13;
work as day laborers or domestics. Despite these additional income sources, incidence of&#13;
rural poverty, measured in terms of satisfaction of basic needs', remains at 94 percent.&#13;
2.15        Modern agriculture, concentrated in the tropical Lowlands, is conducted by&#13;
a rural elite with relatively large farms, ranging from 50 ha to tens of thousands ha.&#13;
Production is geared towards agricultural and forest export commodities, mainly soybeans&#13;
and timber, and some import substitutes. These enterprises are highly mechanized, raise&#13;
livestock extensively and hold vast tracts of undeveloped land. In recent years, this sector&#13;
has shown considerable dynamism and growth.&#13;
Social Context&#13;
2.16        Vibrant and diverse indigenous cultures are fundamental characteristics of&#13;
the rural sector. In the Highland Plateau, most of the population pertain to the largest&#13;
indigenous group, the Aymara- and Quechua-speakers (2.5 million people). The Highland&#13;
Plateau also encompasses the Chipayas and the Urus. People of the Valleys are of diverse&#13;
ethnic origin, but generally speak Quechua. In the Lowlands, there are 26 indigenous&#13;
groups, speaking at least fifteen different languages and comprising between 80,000 to&#13;
150,000 people. The indigenous Lowland people are actively defending their territorial&#13;
claims against encroaching lumber companies and extensive livestock operations.&#13;
Throughout the country, fragmentation of traditional structures emanating from pressures&#13;
to survive in a rapidly changing national economic environment threaten the cultural&#13;
identity of nearly all the indigenous people.&#13;
2.17        Rural society, across the ethnic groups, is composed of, and revolves&#13;
around community organizations which carry out important communal social, economic&#13;
and religious functions2 Any important community issue is decided by consensus in the&#13;
assembly of heads of families of the community, ayllu, the community's highest decision-&#13;
making authority. In most respects, allegiance to the ayllu and the community far exceeds&#13;
that to any civil Government. The ayllu manages and distributes communal lands and&#13;
resolves disputes among members and between other communities. Through these&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
organizations, the traditional rural community concepts - reciprocity, consensus and&#13;
redistribution - prevail.&#13;
2.18        While the role of rural women varies with their cultural origin and their&#13;
degree of urbanization,3 some generalizations can be made concerning their position in the&#13;
rural society. Women are solely responsible for domestic affairs, including family&#13;
nutrition, education and health. They provide child care, cultivate, process and prepare&#13;
basic foods, care for small animals and market farm produce. Agricultural and manual&#13;
labor is divided equally between the husband and wife. In addition, women make crafts&#13;
and textiles providing a significant source of household income.&#13;
2.19        According to the 1992 Census, nearly one-quarter of rural households are&#13;
headed by women. Households with women as heads are most prevalent in the Highland&#13;
Plateau. In Chuquisaca, Potosi and Oruro, because of the high rate of emigration of men,&#13;
more than one-third of poor rural households are headed by women. In the Tropics,&#13;
women head households are less common, with less than 10 percent of the poor rural&#13;
households headed by women. Female-headed households are among the poorest of the&#13;
rural households as family income of those households is only 54 percent of the average&#13;
income of households with both a male and female income earner.&#13;
C.   Rural Development Policy&#13;
2.20        In August 1993, upon assuming office, Government established five policy&#13;
objectives: (i) privatization of public enterprises to stimulate private investment and public&#13;
savings; (ii) employment generation; (iii) greater resource allocation to the public health&#13;
and education systems; (iv) modernization of the Executive Branch; and (v) greater citizen&#13;
participation in public decision-making through popular participation. Fundamental to&#13;
these policies is the principle that the Bolivian people are to become protagonists in their&#13;
own social and economic development which would eventually fully satisfy their basic&#13;
needs through secure access to adequate incomes and good social services.&#13;
2.21        The most important rural sector policy goal is higher productivity,&#13;
especially in the traditional sub-sector, through improved technologies, appropriate&#13;
application of modern inputs and increased productive infrastructure investment. In&#13;
addition, to introduce greater employment opportunities through the diversification of the&#13;
rural economy, the policy promotes efficient non-farm economic activities and encourages&#13;
urban-rural complementarities. Other important policy objectives are to ensure the&#13;
rational use of natural resources and that prices remain undistorted, so that they continue&#13;
to be efficient signals of market demands to producers.&#13;
2.22        Government proposes to address rural poverty alleviation and economic&#13;
development through the incorporation of hitherto marginalized rural and indigenous&#13;
communities into the country's political and economic processes and empower them&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
sufficiently to plan, implement and supervise their economic development. Government&#13;
policy is referenced within a framework of three principles: (i) popular participation;&#13;
(ii) respect for ethnic identities; and (iii) protection of the environment. The new approach&#13;
is predicated on the premise that rural development can only succeed when it respects and&#13;
is built upon the rural communities, their cultural identities and values.&#13;
D. Rural Development Strategy&#13;
2.23         To achieve the policy objectives, Government strategy is to: (i) fully&#13;
implement the participatory development process as outlined in the LPP; (ii) build the&#13;
capacity of public institutions, especially municipalities, and private organizations to&#13;
manage this process; (iii) identify, systematize, and prioritize local demand for rural&#13;
investments to improve productive capacity; and (iv) provide the funds, mainly through&#13;
matching grants, to respond to this demand while at the same time ensuring adequate&#13;
technical capacity to implement the investments.&#13;
Implementation of the Popular Participation Law&#13;
2.24         The LPP of April 1994, provides the legal rationale and impetus for the&#13;
introduction and application of the participatory planning process. The rural development&#13;
strategy supports the LPP by strengthening the rural communities so that they can define&#13;
and direct their own sustainable development. The implementation of the rural strategy&#13;
involves both public institutions and active non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The&#13;
participation of NGOs is a critical determinant of successful implementation because of&#13;
their extensive experience in working with rural communities.&#13;
2.25         The LPP organizes the rural sector into municipalities, so that every area,&#13;
including those previously not serviced by any local government, belongs to a&#13;
municipality. In doing so, the law not only created many new municipalities, but also&#13;
vastly expanded the jurisdiction of existing municipalities. Besides creating a new&#13;
administrative structure, the LPP explicitly recognizes traditional forms of organization&#13;
and representation (Art. 3, LPP). In this context, the Regulation of the LPP (Art. 26-29)&#13;
allows the formation of indigenous municipal districts within municipalities or a&#13;
conjunction of indigenous municipal districts among various municipalities. These&#13;
districts have the following characteristics: (i) their jurisdiction is related to ethnic&#13;
population and their social organization; (ii) election and representation are based on&#13;
traditional ways and means; and (iii) the maximum traditional authority assumes the&#13;
functions of deputy-mayor (sub-alcalde).&#13;
2.26         The LPP calls for the decentralization of political authority and more&#13;
equitable distribution of public revenues. It is a bold attempt to depart from a traditionally&#13;
highly-centralized government structure, where fiscal allocations are subject to the&#13;
discretion of national authorities, influenced by powerful interests. As a result, in the past,&#13;
90 percent of public funds went to the three major urban centers. Under the LPP,&#13;
allocations of funds from the national treasury for the municipalities (Co-participation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
Funds) are to be based exclusively upon the number of inhabitants. In principle, the share&#13;
allocated to the rural municipalities would increase from less than 10 percent at present to&#13;
approximately 50 percent of Co-participation Funds. The LPP stipulates that no more&#13;
than 10 percent of these funds could be allocated to cover municipal administrative costs,&#13;
with the remaining resources being earmarked for new investment, co-financing and&#13;
maintenance costs. To receive the Co-participation funds, municipalities must submit&#13;
annual operative plans and detailed municipal budgets to the central government.&#13;
2.27         For most municipalities the availability of co-participation funds means a&#13;
considerable increase in revenue. Total co-participation funds available for distribution to&#13;
all 301 municipalities in 1995 are estimated at US$145 million. Since the 98 municipalities&#13;
included in the project area are relatively small in terms of population, co-participation&#13;
funds available to those municipalities are estimated at approximately US$20 million in&#13;
1995 (see Annex 6 for details). Given actual disbursements of FDC and FIS at around&#13;
US$50 million in 1994, it is clear that resources available to municipalities for financing&#13;
investments are significant, even taking into account administrative expenditures and&#13;
operation and maintenance costs to be paid from the municipal budget.&#13;
2.28         By virtue of the law, each community becomes a legal entity referred to as&#13;
a Territorial Base Organization (Organizaci6n Territorial de Base, OTB). The OTBs&#13;
select their official representative before the Municipal Council. Any grassroots entity,&#13;
including a traditional community group, such as an ayllu or tribe, or a rural union&#13;
(sindicato), or any individual, designated by the community, qualifies as a representative.&#13;
The OTB can negotiate loan/grant agreements and service contracts and administer funds.&#13;
The communities will also appoint a Supervisory Committee (Comite de Vigilancia--CV)&#13;
to control the activities of the Municipal Council.&#13;
2.29         LPP specifies new and additional obligations for various public, civic and&#13;
private institutions. The responsibility for health, education, irrigation and rural roads&#13;
infrastructure, as well as their maintenance are to be transferred from the central to the&#13;
municipal governments. Municipalities will also be responsible for property tax collection.&#13;
2.30         More importantly, LPP gives new responsibilities and authority to local&#13;
institutions with respect to their social and economic development, outlining a demand-&#13;
driven process for directing public development resources to the rural communities. This&#13;
process begins with rural community members identifying, through consensus, investments&#13;
necessary for their economic development. The communities draft a development plan,&#13;
which their OTB representative submits to the Municipal Development Council. The&#13;
Council coordinates and ranks funding solicitations of the various communities within its&#13;
jurisdiction, and, with the OTBs' input, designs the Municipal Development Plan (Plan&#13;
Municipal de Desarrollo, PMD).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Institutional Capacity Building&#13;
2.31         As part of its strategy, Government would strengthen those public&#13;
institutions, especially SNDR, involved in disseminating and supporting the Participatory&#13;
Planning Process (PPP). The PPP is a set of methodologies designed to facilitate&#13;
community organizations (OTBs) in recognizing and articulating their goals and needs into&#13;
development plans. Central to the PPP is the community diagnostic, a method relying on&#13;
group dynamics which allows community members to focus on their assets, visualize goals&#13;
and evaluate development requirements (see Annex 1).&#13;
2.32         To carry out the PPP the municipalities and the rural community&#13;
organizations must be able to: (i) prepare municipal development plans; (ii) galvanize a&#13;
consensus among members; (iii) present their plans to donor institutions for financing, and&#13;
(iv) supervise and be held financially accountable for the projects.&#13;
2.33        While the rural sector has historically been composed of effective&#13;
community organizations, few have had any experience in identifying, formulating and&#13;
prioritizing their development investment needs and presenting them in formats acceptable&#13;
for financing. Many rural organizations do not fully understand their new responsibilities&#13;
as defined in the LPP. Others are neither technically nor administratively ready to assume&#13;
these responsibilities.&#13;
2.34         Training programs would therefore be an important component of&#13;
institutional capacity building. Effective implementation of participatory rural&#13;
development requires training for: (i) municipalities; (ii) Executing Agencies (Entidades&#13;
Ejecutoras, EE); and (iii) OTBs. All are important to ensure that the participatory process&#13;
reaches the rural communities and that the communities are capable of responding to the&#13;
challenges presented by the process. The objective of the training program is to transmit&#13;
the precepts of Government's new rural development strategy to rural communities and&#13;
provide the technical, managerial and administrative skills for the strategy's effective&#13;
implementation. Training is described in Annex 7.&#13;
2.35        Government, with IDA support, has already conducted a pilot project in&#13;
nine provinces and has been verifying the validity and appropriateness of the PPP&#13;
methodology. As result of the findings of this pilot project, the PPP methodology is being&#13;
adjusted to the particular social, economic and cultural conditions of the communities.&#13;
Consequently, SNDR's regional representation would be strengthened by establishing new&#13;
offices and increasing staff in existing branches.&#13;
E. Institutional Framework&#13;
Public Institutions&#13;
2.36        The following institutions have mandates relevant to this project: (i) the&#13;
Ministry of Human Development (Ministerio de Desarrollo Humano, MHD) with the&#13;
National Secretariat for Rural Development, and the National Secretariat of Ethnic,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
Gender, and Youth Affairs; and (ii) the Ministry of Sustainable Development and&#13;
Environment (Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Medio Ambiente, MDSMA) with its&#13;
National Secretariat for Popular Participation.&#13;
2.37         The National Secretariat for Rural Development (Secretaria Nacional&#13;
de Desarrollo Rural, SNDR) promotes integrated rural development through the&#13;
participation of grassroots community organizations. Its programs are highly targeted to&#13;
the rural poor. SNDR formulates rural development policies and facilitates the&#13;
implementation of the PPP through organization, training, and empowerment of local&#13;
institutions. In addition, it follows-up and facilitates the preparation and implementation&#13;
of local investment projects based on results generated in the participatory planning&#13;
process. In general terms, SNDR could be considered as government's outreach agency,&#13;
which intermediates between rural communities and state. Annex 3 describes the role of&#13;
SNDR in more detail.&#13;
2.38         The National Secretariat of Ethnic, Gender, and Youth Affairs&#13;
(Secretaria Nacional de Etnias, Genero y Generaciones, SNEGG) safeguards respect for&#13;
the diverse ethnic identities of indigenous people and their rights as collective units. While&#13;
its mandate is not limited to any specific region, current activities of SNEGG focus on the&#13;
territorial issues of the indigenous peoples in the Eastern Lowlands. In addition, SNEGG&#13;
deals with social, legal and economic issues related to the status of women and youth.&#13;
2.39        The National Secretariat for Popular Participation (Secretaria&#13;
Nacional de Participaci6n Popular, SNPP) developed the popular participation legislation&#13;
and is now designing procedures and regulations for the law's implementation. SNPP&#13;
would be responsible for the transfer of powers between the central and local&#13;
governments. Through its departmental offices, SNPP is assisting with creation and&#13;
institutional strengthening of municipalities, and formation and registration of OTBs.&#13;
2.40        The Regional Development Corporations (Corporaciones Regionales de&#13;
Desarrollo, CORDES) are important players in the planning process as a recent&#13;
Presidential Decree4 assigns to them a wide range of responsibilities concerning planning&#13;
of Departmental investments, and strengthening of municipalities. In general terms,&#13;
CORDES are expected to: (i) integrate municipal plans in a Departmental planning&#13;
perspective; and (ii) ensure that allocation of resources in the Departments is in line with&#13;
participatory planning at the micro-regional and sub-regional level. More specific relevant&#13;
responsibilities include: (i) developing and maintaining Departmental databases including&#13;
information on existing resources, development constraints, and investment opportunities;&#13;
(ii) strengthening municipal capacity to implement PPP efforts, prepare PAOs, and manage&#13;
natural resources; (iii) preparing and executing investment projects whose impact goes&#13;
beyond the municipal level; (iv) preparing and executing local investment projects which&#13;
are too complex to be handled by municipalities; (v) promoting and coordinating the&#13;

Desarrollo, 18 de agosto de 1994.&#13;
&#13;

- 10-&#13;
implementation of environmental impact assessments of investment projects proposed by&#13;
municipal governments or other public and private agencies; and (vi) establishing&#13;
investment priorities from a Departmental perspective.&#13;
2.41        Coordination among Agencies. To coordinate the activities of the&#13;
different Secretariats involved in the implementation of the LPP, an Inter-secretarial&#13;
Committee was established on July 12, 1994, following "Resolucidn Biministerial&#13;
No. 013/94". To more specifically coordinate the involvement of the Ministries of Human&#13;
Development and Sustainable Development and Environment in the preparation of the&#13;
Rural Communities Development Project, an inter-ministerial coordination-ordination&#13;
program was established on July 15, 1994, following "Resolucd6n Biministerial&#13;
No. 07/94. A draft agreement, prepared by the committee, indicates that SNDR, SNPP&#13;
and the Regional Development Corporations (CORDES) agree that SNDR would take a&#13;
leading role to implement the LPP in 98 municipalities included in the target area of&#13;
project intervention, whereas the CORDES would have primary responsibility regarding&#13;
this task in the other 205 municipalities.&#13;
Funding Agencies&#13;
2.42        The Small-Farmer Development Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo&#13;
Campesino - FDC) is an autonomous public institution financing rural development&#13;
activities and investments. It was created in 1989 and operates under the Ministry of the&#13;
Presidency (MP). According to a new structure, FDC has a Board composed of four&#13;
Directors, appointed by the MP Minister and headed by a President nominated by the&#13;
President of the Republic. In addition, there is a General Manager, appointed by the FDC&#13;
Board, responsible for administration and operation. Within FDC, there are four divisions:&#13;
(i) Infrastructure and Services; (ii) Credit; (iii) Administration and Finance; and&#13;
(iv) Planning, Follow-up and Evaluation.&#13;
2.43        FDC is a financial intermediary, involved in project appraisal, approval,&#13;
disbursement, and technical follow-up. Within the Investment Program for Small-Farmer&#13;
Development (Programa de Inversi6n para el Desarrollo Campesino, PIDC), FDC&#13;
finances, on a grant basis, initiatives up to a maximum of US$250,000 per project in:&#13;
(i) basic infrastructure, including feeder roads, bridges, irrigation, markets, cottage&#13;
industries, and protective structures; (ii) agro-support services, such as technical&#13;
assistance and extension to farmers, revolving funds, and farm inputs; (iii) reclamation&#13;
projects, like sub-watershed management and agro-forestry projects; and (iv) institutional&#13;
strengthening for executing agencies and target communities. Beneficiary communities&#13;
contribute in labor, kind or cash between 10 and 30 percent of the project costs. FDC&#13;
channels finance through Executing Agencies (EEs), such as NGOs, cooperatives,&#13;
CORDES, farmer associations, OTBs and municipal administrations. EEs must meet FDC&#13;
eligibility criteria which include technical and financial capabilities and experience with the&#13;
beneficiary community and region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
2.44        From 1989 to 1992, FDC's performance has been troubled by low&#13;
disbursements, due to poor management, primarily in its credit operations. The&#13;
organization was restructured in 1993, the same year various donors, including the IDB&#13;
and several bilateral donors, made a new capital pledge amounting to US$33.7 million.&#13;
FDC's operations have considerably improved since then. Disbursement have reached&#13;
US$5 million in 1994, representing a threefold increase compared to 1993. A further&#13;
increase to US$10 million is expected in 1995. As per November 1994, FDC's investment&#13;
portfolio under the PIDC consisted of 201 projects in rural infrastructure (49 percent),&#13;
institutional strengthening (35 percent), and support to agricultural production&#13;
(16 percent). The technical preparation of project proposals, often with feasibility studies,&#13;
required prior to FDC proposal review still precludes many communities from accessing&#13;
FDC funds. The communities are neither technically nor financially equipped to prepare&#13;
these studies. In addition, the highly centralized sub-project approval and administration&#13;
procedures are inefficient. These deficiencies are being addressed through simplification&#13;
of FDC procedures and delegation of greater authority to the regional offices. These&#13;
measures, along with efforts to improve the capacity of executing agencies in project&#13;
preparation and procurement operations, are expected to substantially increase FDC local&#13;
investment portfolio and actual disbursements.&#13;
Executing Agenciess&#13;
2.45        Executing Agencies are all those public and private institutions, with legal&#13;
status, capable of assisting in the implementation of investment sub-projects. EEs would&#13;
accompany local communities through the participatory planning process from project&#13;
conceptualization to implementation. EEs would help communities to identify and rank&#13;
investment needs, formulate PMDs and prepare and present project proposals to the&#13;
appropriate funding agencies for financing.&#13;
2.46        Besides the CORDES, EEs would be primarily drawn from the large NGO&#13;
community and the more developed OTBs. The Bolivian NGO movement originates from&#13;
Catholic Church missionaries in the 60's. In the 70's, politically-oriented NGOs were&#13;
created to oppose the military governments. The economic crises associated with the&#13;
structural adjustment policies of the 80's, increased the number of NGOs working among&#13;
the poor urban and rural communities.&#13;
2.47        Today, more than 600 NGOs manage annually US$200 million in funds&#13;
from bilateral cooperation and the Bolivian Government. The NGO movement in Bolivia&#13;
is a precursor to the participatory strategy, as 24 NGOs already have Participatory&#13;
Planning experience6. Two examples of on-going NGO efforts in participatory planning,&#13;
dating back some ten years, are in the provinces of Mizque, with the NGO, CEDEAGRO,&#13;
5 Annex 3 describes the role of the rural institutions and Executing Agencies.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and Zudaniez, with PROAGRO. To benefit from this extensive experience, both provinces&#13;
were included in the SNDR pilot project.&#13;
2.48        Around 3857 NGOs are organized into three networks: UNITAS (Uni6n&#13;
Nacional de Institucionespara el Trabajo de Acci6n Social), ERBOL (Escuela&#13;
Radiof6nica de Bolivia) and AIPE (Asociaci6n de Institucionespara Educaci6n). These&#13;
are coordinated by a national NGO network. Among the NGOs, there is a sub-group of&#13;
80 NGOs referred to as Social Development Institutions (Instituciones para el Desarrollo&#13;
Social, IPDS). These NGOs have attempted to distinguish themselves by adopting&#13;
relatively rigid professional standards, including external audits. The IPDS seeks&#13;
sustainable development, instead of charitable activities.&#13;
2.49        There are 146 registered NGOs in the target area of project intervention.&#13;
Among these, 93 (63 percent) work in rural development, and, more than a third in&#13;
agricultural production, another third in marketing, and almost all (93 percent) conduct&#13;
training and extension activities.&#13;
2.50        Through the formation of OTBs, grassroots organizations play an&#13;
important role as the catalysts of the participatory planning process at the community&#13;
level. At the same time, the results of their efforts at the community level form the&#13;
building stones of development plans, integrated and prioritized by the OTBs at the&#13;
municipal level. With an average of approximately 40 communities per municipality, a&#13;
total of approximately 12,000 OTBs will be created under the LPP. Besides grassroots&#13;
organizations at the community level, matrix organizations, like the centrales inldigenas,&#13;
are expected to play an important role in the preservation of traditional forms of&#13;
representation and organization within the context of municipal structures. To define a&#13;
more even balance between traditional powers and new powers concentrated in the&#13;
municipalities, these matrix organizations would be expected to take a leading role in the&#13;
formation of indigenous municipal districts within and among municipalities.&#13;
3. BANK STRATEGY AND EXPERIENCE&#13;
A. IDA Assistance Strategy&#13;
3.1         As the first stage of structural adjustment has matured in Bolivia, the&#13;
strategy of economic reforms and social emergency programs has been replaced by a&#13;
"second generation" set of reforms to address the remaining constraints to growth. The&#13;
most recent Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board on February 8, 1994,&#13;
defines the main components of the reforms which are designed to: (i) unbind the&#13;
productive and export potential of the country's most important natural resources--&#13;
hydrocarbons and minerals--by providing a legal and institutional framework which&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
supports private investment, and by attracting private management and capital into these&#13;
sectors through the capitalization program; (ii) strengthen essential public institutions&#13;
which define and enforce policy by implementing programs such as civil service,&#13;
legal/judicial, and land administration reforms; (iii) alleviate poverty through income&#13;
enhancing and social projects, including in particular improving the coverage and the&#13;
quality of basic education; and (iv) improve the management of the country's natural&#13;
resources and protect the environment, in order to maintain growth in the long-term and&#13;
avoid degradation of renewable resources.&#13;
3.2         IDA's objectives for the rural sector is to support the Bolivian Government&#13;
in formulating a sector strategy, that is consistent with the above overall country goals and&#13;
assists with the implementation of new Government policies of sustainable development&#13;
and popular participation. The challenge of the new sector strategy is to formulate and&#13;
implement an integrated approach towards rural development which simultaneously seeks&#13;
to alleviate rural poverty, increase agricultural productivity and improve natural resource&#13;
management by taking into account the opportunities and limitations of each of Bolivia's&#13;
major agro-ecological zones. The two important pillars of the IDA sector strategy are:&#13;
(i) the proposed Rural Communities Development Project, that supports the direct&#13;
involvement of rural and indigenous peoples in the identification and execution of local&#13;
investments in support of the rural economy with a primary focus in the traditional&#13;
agricultural areas, but also including new community settlements of the Lowlands; and&#13;
(ii) the National Land Administration Project, designed to improve the legal and&#13;
regulatory framework for land, restructure the public agencies responsible for enforcement&#13;
and establish a legal cadastre to secure property rights in the areas of highest conflict and&#13;
potential (Lowlands). These new operations would complement ongoing projects, most&#13;
notably: the Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer Project; the Eastern&#13;
Lowlands Natural Resource Management and Agricultural Production Project, which&#13;
supports land use zoning for the region; the Agro-Export Development Project; and the&#13;
Environmental Technical Assistance and Biodiversity Protection Projects.&#13;
B. Bank Group Operations&#13;
3.3         Up to December 1994, IBRD and IDA lent to Bolivia a total amount of&#13;
US$1.29 billion of which about 50 percent (US$613.9 million) took place since 1987 and&#13;
95 percent was for investment lending. Since 1987 natural resources (agriculture,&#13;
livestock, forestry and environment) took up 14 percent or US$83.3 million of total&#13;
lending, balance of payments support under structural adjustment 16 percent, public&#13;
management five percent, infrastructure 38 percent, education and health 18 percent, and&#13;
industry and private sector development nine percent.&#13;
3.4         In the natural resources sector, there are four on-going operations: The&#13;
Eastem Lowlands Natural Resources Management and Agricultural Production Project&#13;
(FY90 - Cr. 2119-BO), Agricultural Technology Development Project (FY91 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Cr. 2216-BO), Agricultural Export Development Project (FY92 - Cr. 2322-BO),&#13;
Environment Technical Assistance Project (FY93 - Cr. 2443-BO). Moreover, IDA is also&#13;
managing one GEF-funded Biodiversity Conservation Project.&#13;
C. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
3.5         The project is fully consistent with three of the broad objectives of the&#13;
Bank strategy described in the CAS and presented to the Board on February 8, 1994:&#13;
strengthening of essential public institutions, alleviation of poverty, and better&#13;
management of the country's natural resources. IDA is intensively providing assistance in&#13;
the rural areas in the health, education, water supply and sanitation sectors. The proposed&#13;
project intends to strengthen the community structures which have to design, implement&#13;
and maintain these local projects. Institutional strengthening of municipalities,&#13;
communities and NGOs would increase the communities' absorption capacity and the&#13;
NGO's intermediation capacity. It would also considerably increase the effectiveness of&#13;
all donor-funded projects in the rural areas. This way, IDA would act as a catalyst to&#13;
accelerate disbursements and/or commitments of external funds in support of the rural&#13;
sector. The Bank's experience with the social investment fund (Fondo de Inversi6n&#13;
Social, FIS) and elsewhere in Latin America means that it is uniquely placed to play this&#13;
role.&#13;
D. Lessons from Experience&#13;
3.6         Past Experience: Past development efforts in Bolivia were highly&#13;
centralized, top-down and rarely met the real needs of the rural population. Experience&#13;
from the IDA-financed Omasoyos-Los Andes Development Project and the Ulla Ulla&#13;
Development Project shows that these centralized projects have been alien to the&#13;
beneficiaries, administratively complex, costly to maintain and can not be sustained.&#13;
Experience from pilot projects and isolated programs in Bolivia shows that successful&#13;
development efforts tend to be those administered at the local level by NGOs or other&#13;
groups close to the beneficiary communities. The experience of the past twenty years in&#13;
Bolivia clearly indicates that effective rural projects have: (i) been relatively small and&#13;
built upon existing traditional social structures; (ii) been designed, formulated and&#13;
executed with considerable beneficiary participation; and (iii) have sufficiently taken into&#13;
account the role of women in the household and the community, and have integrated&#13;
women in the project development and implementation.&#13;
3.7          The 1993 Agriculture Sector Review concluded that: (i) local participation&#13;
needed to be promoted to achieve greater relevance and efficiency in the design and&#13;
implementation of public expenditure in rural areas; (ii) Governments should decentralize&#13;
many of their functions to more local levels, and seek greater involvement of local&#13;
communities, particularly in the design and management of public infrastructure projects in&#13;
rural areas; and (iii) involvement of local communities should be sought through social and&#13;
administrative arrangements that encourage and reward people's participation in public&#13;
expenditure decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
3.8          Pilot Project. The pilot project, implemented in 1994 as part of the&#13;
preparation of the proposed project, taught the following lessons: (i) the mobilization of&#13;
local actors is easier than expected; (ii) OTBs in remote areas lack not only skills to&#13;
prepare project but also information on available resources; and (iii) the participative&#13;
planning methodology approach is valid but has to be adjusted from its initial bureaucratic&#13;
approach to a more practical method taking into account the level of education and culture&#13;
of the people.&#13;
3.9        Social Infrastructure Fund (FIS). Among the lessons learned through the&#13;
experiences of FIS and other funds in Bolivia are: (i) political interference can be&#13;
minimized through full transparency, accountability, and well-defined project eligibility and&#13;
evaluation criteria; (ii) simplified procurement procedures for small and widely dispersed&#13;
sub-projects can succeed, provided there are effective controls; (iii) allocation of resources&#13;
for project finance to be balanced with funds for project supervision; (iv) geographic&#13;
targeting is not sufficient for reaching the very poor because of the range of household&#13;
incomes in most geographic areas; (v) collaboration with line ministries is crucial to ensure&#13;
that investments are consistent with sector and Government priorities and sustainable; and&#13;
(vi) demand-driven approach among the poorer communities require promotional&#13;
activities and technical assistance.&#13;
3.10         Regional Experience in Demand-Driven Development: A recent Bank&#13;
Review of demand-driven development funds in Latin Americas revealed that, by&#13;
encouraging the active involvement of community groups, the projects were much more&#13;
likely to meet the community's needs than if they were chosen to reflect the priorities of a&#13;
government agency. Second, once the communities developed a sense of ownership of a&#13;
project, they were more willing and interested in sharing in its costs and ensuring its&#13;
maintenance. Third, experience indicated that once a community group was given&#13;
responsibility for implementing a project that it had helped to choose and prepare it had a&#13;
great interest in ensuring that the private contractor executing the project does so well and&#13;
honestly.&#13;
3.11         The experience of Mexico's National Solidarity Fund (PRONASOL) bears&#13;
this out. A major feature of PRONASOL's operations is the involvement of municipal&#13;
governments and community groups in identifying preparing and implementing small&#13;
social and economic projects. An evaluation of projects financed by PRONASOL&#13;
indicates that the sustainability of these projects is likely to be high when: (i) projects are&#13;
selected locally, which indicates that beneficiaries consider them to be of high priority; and&#13;
(ii) a sense of beneficiary ownership and knowledge of the projects has resulted in direct&#13;
participation, along with municipal governments, in project implementation. Moreover,&#13;
the report indicates that projects financed by PRONASOL's Municipal Fund and&#13;

implemented with the help of the communities had much lower costs than similar projects&#13;
implemented by line ministries.&#13;
E. Environmental Issues&#13;
3.12         Deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution and loss of natural habitat are&#13;
key environmental problems. Annually, an estimated 50-60,000 ha are deforested because&#13;
of farmer encroachment, road construction, migration and logging. Soil erosion, a&#13;
consequence of deforestation, and overuse of land, affects about 35 percent of the total&#13;
territory. Water pollution, caused by industrial waste discharge, especially from mines,&#13;
poses serious health hazards to a wide cross-section of the population. Bolivia is also&#13;
losing its unique flora and fauna resources, mainly as a consequence of deforestation,&#13;
contraband trade, and migration to the Lowlands. Indiscriminate land clearing, road&#13;
construction, poor management of land, water and forest resources threaten the&#13;
sustainability of agriculture, forestry and biodiversity. Key constraints to improved&#13;
environmental management include: (i) inadequate policy, legal and regulatory framework&#13;
for natural resources management; (ii) weak institutional structures, along with the&#13;
absence of clearly defined responsibilities for environmental protection and management;&#13;
and (iii) a lack of technical resource management capacity.&#13;
4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives and Scope&#13;
4.1          Objectives. The overall project objectives are to: (a) alleviate rural&#13;
poverty by carrying out rural investments identified and formulated following a&#13;
participatory planning process; (b) enhance the institutional capacity of the Secretariat for&#13;
Rural Development (SNDR), the Small-Farmer Development Fund (FDC), and the&#13;
Secretariat for Popular Participation (SNPP) to carry out the project; (c) improve the&#13;
capacity of municipalities and rural communities to implement municipal development&#13;
plans (PMD); and (d) strengthen non-government organizations (NGOs) assisting&#13;
municipalities and rural communities in identifying, formulating and implementing rural&#13;
investments and managing their PMDs.&#13;
4.2          Specific objectives are to: (i) operationalize and institutionalize&#13;
participatory planning processes at the municipal and community level, following&#13;
principles laid down in the Popular Participation Law; (ii) empower grassroots&#13;
organizations to effectively take the planning of community development efforts in their&#13;
own hands; (iii) assist municipalities in the formulation and implementation of municipal&#13;
development plans; (iv) strengthen executing and co-operating agencies in sub-project&#13;
preparation, implementation, and administration; and (v) increase and improve FDC's&#13;
rural investment portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
4.3          Scope. The capacity building components of the project would be&#13;
implemented in about 98 out of a total of 301 municipalities9. These municipalities have&#13;
been selected on the basis of: (i) incidence of poverty, (ii) development potential, and&#13;
(iii) existing institutional capacity. Each municipality includes on average 40 communities,&#13;
bringing the total number of communities included in the project area to approximately&#13;
4,000. Total population in the project area is estimated at approximately 1.1 million&#13;
people, of which 0.9 million live in rural areas. Most project beneficiaries would be&#13;
indigenous people. To enhance the opportunities for alternative development in coca&#13;
growing areas, Government has included all municipalities of the Chapare region into the&#13;
scope of the project. The rural investment component would be implemented in the whole&#13;
country.&#13;
B. Project Components&#13;
4.4          To achieve the above objectives, the project would: (i) identify and&#13;
formulate rural investments by financing the preparation of community projects and&#13;
municipal development plans; (ii) finance training of development agencies to introduce,&#13;
support and sustain participatory planning processes and to ensure effective&#13;
implementation of municipal development plans and community-generated investments;&#13;
(iii) finance institutional strengthening of the Secretariat for Rural Development (SNDR),&#13;
the Small-Farmer Development Fund (FDC), the Secretariat for Popular Participation&#13;
(SNPP) and municipalities; and (iv) finance pre-investment studies and rural community&#13;
investments through FDC. Total estimated project cost is US$31 million.&#13;
L     Rural Investment Identirication and Formulation (Base costs US$2.5 million)&#13;
4.5          This component would provide technical assistance to municipalities and&#13;
OTBs to: (i) carry out Municipal Development Plans following a Participatory Planning&#13;
Process in the target area of project intervention; (ii) register OTBs and establish&#13;
Supervisory Committees (CVs); (iii) form indigenous municipal districts; and (iv) prepare&#13;
rural investment sub-projects through identification, design and feasibility studies.&#13;
4.6          Workshops in Participatory Planning. Executing Agencies (EE) would&#13;
assist rural communities in the five steps of the PPP process: (i) preparation;&#13;
(ii) community diagnostic; (iii) municipal development plan; (iv) follow-up to the&#13;
development plans; and (v) sub-project preparation. The steps are described in Annex 1&#13;
and presented in Figure 1, below.&#13;
4.7          The first three steps have already been carried out in 1994 and 1995 under&#13;
the pilot project. In 94 municipalities, EEs conducted two workshops to: (i) explain the&#13;
Popular Participation Law and Government's rural development strategy; (ii) encourage&#13;
participation; (iii) assess the relative strengths of the local institutions; and (iv) initiate the&#13;
implementation of the planning process. Through the community diagnostic, the&#13;
9 Annex 2 gives an overview of the target area of project intervention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
communities evaluated their own resources, constraints and requirements to achieve their&#13;
economic potential. The outcome of these sessions were complemented with secondary-&#13;
source data to produce a "community profile". These profiles were used to prepare&#13;
community plans, which were consolidated in 94 draft Municipal Development Plans&#13;
(Plan Municipal de Desarrollo, PMD) during several workshops in each municipality.&#13;
Additional workshops would be held to include the municipalities of the Chapare region.&#13;

4.8         Assistance and Follow-up to the Municipal Development Plan. EEs&#13;
would continue to assist the municipalities with the formulation of annual implementation&#13;
plans (Plan Operativo Anual, PAO). This support is important because municipalities&#13;
must submit to the central government a PAO and a detailed municipal budget to gain&#13;
access to co-participation funds: As municipal elections will take place at the end of 1995,&#13;
EEs would help the newly-elected municipal councils to adjust their PMDs to reflect their&#13;
policies and strategies. To take into account changing social and economic conditions, the&#13;
PMDs could be annually adjusted. EEs would also assist the individual communities with&#13;
the implementation of their plans and sub-projects.&#13;
4.9          OTB Registration and CV establishment. To sustain the participatory&#13;
planning process, EEs would help OTBs to officially register. Registration would provide&#13;
OTBs with legal status and would facilitate their interactions with funding agencies, the&#13;
municipality and the financial sector. SNDR and EEs would help communities to establish&#13;
the Supervisory Committees and assist them in their operation.&#13;
4.10         Assistance to Form Indigenous Municipal Districts. Following strong&#13;
demands from indigenous communities, EEs would support municipalities in the creation&#13;
of indigenous municipal districts, which would include a consultation process resulting in&#13;
the definition of such districts from a functional perspective. Terms and conditions under&#13;
which such districts are formed are presently the sole responsibility of the municipalities.&#13;
To provide guidance in this area through the provision of basic norms and procedures, a&#13;
legal definition of the relation between municipalities and indigenous municipal districts is&#13;
urgently required. For this purpose draft legislation would be developed. To allow for the&#13;
effective participation of indigenous apex organizations in this process, the project would&#13;
also support the institutional strengthening of these organizations.&#13;
4.11         Sub-Project Identification and Preparation. Under the project, EEs&#13;
would assist municipalities and OTBs in selecting sub-projects, drafting sub-project&#13;
profiles, and identifying funding sources. Such assistance would be coordinated with the&#13;
municipality and the funding agencies. The profile would describe the sub-project's&#13;
objectives, beneficiaries and estimated costs. EEs would assist the rural communities to&#13;
present the sub-project profile to the office(s) of the potential funding agency(ies). On the&#13;
basis of the profile, the funding agencies would decide whether the sub-projects satisfy&#13;
their eligibility criteria. If the sub-project is acceptable, a Cooperating Agency (EC)&#13;
would be contracted to carry out technical studies for final evaluation (see para. 4.44).&#13;
4.12        Indigenous Community Sub-Projects. In order to allow local investment&#13;
funds to effectively respond to specific sub-project demands from indigenous communities&#13;
expressed in indigenous district development sub-plans, SNDR's Sub-secretariat for&#13;
Production Promotion would develop standard profiles for such sub-projects. COTESU&#13;
would finance studies to explore new areas of potential rural investments for the medium-&#13;
term future. Tentative subjects of such studies would be the recuperation of traditional&#13;
technologies and micro-enterprises involved in agro-processing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Implementation&#13;
4.13         To implement the above program, SNDR, if required, would enter into&#13;
management service contracts with Executing Agencies (mainly NGOs) to: (i) organize&#13;
provincial, municipal and community workshops introducing and implementing the PPP&#13;
methodology; (ii) monitor and assist municipalities in implementation of their annual&#13;
operation plans; (iii) assist grassroots organizations in their legal registration; and&#13;
(iv) ensure the implementation of suitable sub-project design and/or feasibility studies and&#13;
their presentation to potential local funding agencies. These contracts would specify the&#13;
EEs' terms of reference, expected output and remuneration. Sample EE contracts and&#13;
terms of reference, acceptable to IDA, would be included in the Project Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
4.14         To participate in this program EEs would need to: (i) have at least three&#13;
years experience in institutional strengthening of OTBs, participative planning, design and&#13;
management of rural development and infrastructure projects, or rural development&#13;
training; (ii) employ at least three professionals of intermediate education level or higher;&#13;
(iii) have an established administrative system (bank certificates, accounting); (iv) be&#13;
legally established in an office. These eligibility criteria would be included in the Project&#13;
Operational Manual. Peace Corps (USA NGO) has shown interest in participating in this&#13;
program and SNDR is awaiting further proposals from Peace Corps.&#13;
4.15         Under this component the project would finance: (i) workshops, seminars&#13;
and conferences for municipalities, OTBs and indigenous apex organizations; (ii) EE&#13;
management service contracts to include organization of workshops and seminars, OTB&#13;
registration, establishment of CVs, design of indigenous municipal development plans,&#13;
PMD adjustment and PAO implementation monitoring; (iii) technical assistance for the&#13;
formulation of a legal framework governing the relation between municipalities and&#13;
indigenous municipal development districts; (iv) management service contracts to enable&#13;
indigenous organizations to hire legal assistance in areas where they lack experience; and&#13;
(v) consulting contracts to undertake studies related to the recuperation of traditional&#13;
technologies and micro-enterprises.&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
4.16         The activities financed under this project component would result in the&#13;
registration of OTBs, representing approximately 4,000 communities in 98 municipalities.&#13;
In each of these municipalities the project activities would result in a first PAO, firmly&#13;
based on a genuine participatory planning process. By financing sub-project preparation&#13;
studies for those communities unable to prepare them, the project would considerably&#13;
increase the sub-project pipeline, facilitate FDC disbursements and provide an immediate&#13;
follow-up to the participatory development process. For this purpose, EEs would help&#13;
prepare at least ten sub-project profiles per municipality. In addition, a total of at least&#13;
30 indigenous municipal districts and district development sub-plans would be prepared.&#13;
The experience gained in this process would form the base to formulate a draft regulation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
which would legally define norms and procedures under which indigenous municipal&#13;
districts would be formed and operated.&#13;
H.   Training (Base Costs US$2.0 rnillion)&#13;
4.17        Through this component the project would finance training of public and&#13;
private organizations in participatory planning methodology, adjustment of PMs,&#13;
management and monitoring of PMDs and PAOs, and sub-project preparation and&#13;
implementation.&#13;
4.18        Training in PPP Methodology. To ensure nation-wide coverage of PPP&#13;
implementation, SNDR would train CORDES and EEs in PPP methodology to enable&#13;
them to monitor, implement and accompany participatory planning processes in an&#13;
additional 205 municipalities. SNDR would organize one national and nine Departmental&#13;
workshops to train CORDES and EEs in: (i) the general principles of the PPP; (ii) the&#13;
execution of community diagnostics; (iii) the prioritization and integration of community&#13;
development proposals in a comprehensive PMD; (iv) the formulation and preparation of&#13;
PAOs; and (v) the identification and prioritization of community investment projects. In&#13;
addition, three such workshops would be organized for indigenous matrix organizations to&#13;
enable them to coordinate and monitor the PPP in the indigenous municipal districts within&#13;
their jurisdiction.&#13;
4.19        Training in Adjustment of PMDs. Anticipating the need to adjust PMDs&#13;
after the municipal elections scheduled in 1995, SNDR would also organize nine&#13;
Departmental workshops to train EEs in PMD revision and adjustment in a participatory&#13;
context. Those EEs would subsequently train municipal governments and OTBs.&#13;
4.20        Training in PMDIPAO Management and Monitoring. EEs would train&#13;
municipal governments and OTBs in: (i) criteria for preparing investment profiles;&#13;
(ii) potential financing sources for local investments; (iii) eligibility criteria of potential&#13;
investment funds; (iv) procedures for contracting EEs preparing and implementing sub-&#13;
projects; (v) supervision of sub-project implementation; and (vi) adjustment of PAOs.&#13;
4.21        Technical Training in Sub-Project Preparation and Implementation.&#13;
The inability of many NGOs and local consulting firms to prepare and present sub-project&#13;
proposals in a format acceptable to funding agencies has delayed sub-project approvals&#13;
and rural investments. To improve sub-project preparation skills, SNDR would contract&#13;
firms to run workshops training EEs to design sub-projects, carry out feasibility studies&#13;
and prepare "bankable" sub-project proposals. The training would focus on projects in&#13;
support of agricultural production, rural infi-astructure, and natural resources management.&#13;
The contracted firm(s) would conduct 30 workshops, addressing: (i) standard sub-project&#13;
analytical methods; (ii) sub-project design and feasibility studies and their presentation;&#13;
and (iii) evaluation criteria of FDC/FIS and major donors for typical rural investments,&#13;
including irrigation and water control, feeder roads, and other productive infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
4.22        The project would also finance consultant services to provide technical and&#13;
managerial assistance to EEs, municipalities and OTBs in preparing final project designs.&#13;
This assistance is particularly envisaged for preparing relatively complex operations and&#13;
would be provided upon request of the beneficiaries concerned. Eligibility criteria&#13;
(specified in the Project Operational Manual) to receive technical assistance would&#13;
include: (i) a proven track record of the agency in the area of project intervention;&#13;
(ii) compatibility of the sub-project proposal with PMD and/or PAO; and (iii) agreement&#13;
between the OTB, as a representative of potential project beneficiaries, and the agency on&#13;
developing a particular project idea/profile into a final design.&#13;
4.23        Implementation. The above training programs would be implemented&#13;
either by SNDR or EEs contracted by SNDR. Terms of Reference of the above&#13;
mentioned training programs are presented in Annex 7. Terms of reference of Executing&#13;
Agencies to implement training in participatory planning have been agreed upon during&#13;
appraisal and would be included in the Project Operational Manual. Given the innovative&#13;
nature of the above training programs and SNDR's limited experience in managing them,&#13;
it has been agreed during negotiations that the content and the methodology of the&#13;
training programs would be included in the annual implementation plans to be&#13;
reviewed with IDA (para. 8.1).&#13;
4.24        The project would finance: (i) the organization of training sessions;&#13;
(ii) management service contracts related to the organization and conducting of training&#13;
sessions; (iii) consultant services for training and technical assistance to EEs; and&#13;
(iv) training expenses as defined in para. 5.20.&#13;
IIL   Institutional Strengthening (Base Costs US$7.6 million)&#13;
4.25        This component would strengthen: (i) SNDR, particularly its Departmental&#13;
network to support and monitor participatory planning and training; (ii) FDC at the&#13;
Departmental level to enable it to decentralize its operations; and (iii) SNPP to enable it to&#13;
carry out municipal strengthening.&#13;
4.26        SNDR Strengthening. To facilitate the implementation of the&#13;
participatory planning process at the municipal level and below, the project would enhance&#13;
SNDR's Departmental field capacity to: coordinate the implementation of the PPP in 98&#13;
municipalities, provide support to PPP implementation in the remaining 205 municipalities,&#13;
follow-up on the implementation of PMDs and PAOs by organizing EE training&#13;
workshops and assisting with sub-project preparation through technical assistance,&#13;
organize and supervise training activities, and monitor sub-project implementation&#13;
activities.&#13;
4.27        SNDR would strongly decentralize its activities into the regions so that the&#13;
Departmental offices become SNDR's main implementation units. In each Departmental&#13;
office, SNDR would establish a team of two-three participatory planning professionals and&#13;
project experts. These teams would have the necessary background on rural development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
strategy, the fundamentals of PPP, teaching methodologies and materials, and project&#13;
preparation guidelines of the major local funding agencies. The teams would be&#13;
responsible for initiating, supervising and monitoring of all SNDR-financed EE activities.&#13;
SNDR would also provide the Departmental offices with logistical support.&#13;
4.28        To ensure smooth project implementation, incremental staff financed under&#13;
the project would strengthen SNDR's central office financial and administrative&#13;
management capacities. SNDR would attempt to integrate this additional staff into the&#13;
public service scheme (Programa de Servicio Civil). SNDR's central staff would operate&#13;
in the technical, training and administrative departments to provide professional guidance&#13;
to regional activities and facilitate inter-agency coordination at the national level.&#13;
4.29        The project would finance: (i) incremental high-level consultant positions&#13;
at the Departmental level and central levels (Annex 8); (ii) civil works to improve office&#13;
accommodation; (iii) office equipment and vehicles; (iv) staff training in organization,&#13;
management and technical matters; and (v) incremental operating costs as defined in&#13;
para. 5.20. Detailed terms of reference for incremental staff and consultants financed&#13;
under the project are included in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
4.30        FDC Strengthening. FDC, in cooperation with its major donors (IDB&#13;
and GTZ) is undertaking a comprehensive overhaul of its procedures. The new&#13;
procedures would permit regional approval of small sub-projects (below a maximum&#13;
ceiling) and simplify legal, administrative, and disbursement procedures. During appraisal,&#13;
agreement has been reached on FDC's decentralization plan and how its implementation&#13;
would be monitored. The Mid-Term Review would evaluate the implementation of the&#13;
decentralized procedures. Adoption of the FDC decentralization plan would be a&#13;
condition of disbursement of the FDC institutional strengthening and investment&#13;
components (para. 8.3).&#13;
4.31        To accompany the above reforms, the project would strengthen FDC's&#13;
Departmental offices by financing one local professional in civil engineering or agronomy&#13;
and one administrative consultant for each Department during three years. This would&#13;
enable FDC to gradually decentralize its management system by delegating authority to&#13;
the Departmental offices to evaluate, approve, finance, and supervise small sub-projects.&#13;
To allow FDC to effectively respond to specific investment demands expressed by&#13;
indigenous communities, one additional professional specialized in ethnic affairs would be&#13;
financed in the second and third project year. Detailed Terms of Reference for the&#13;
consultants financed under the project have been agreed upon during appraisal and are to&#13;
be included in the Project Operational Manual. Moreover, the project would provide&#13;
vehicles and equipment to FDC's Departmental offices.&#13;
4.32        SNPP Strengthening. Strengthening municipalities in the areas of&#13;
administrative and financial management is SNPP's primary responsibility. SNPP has&#13;
already developed a series of training modules for this purpose. The project would&#13;
support SNPP implementing these modules in the project's 98 municipalities by financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
a team of four consultants for a period of two years. Detailed terms of reference for these&#13;
consultants would be included in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
4.33         Strengthening of Municipalities. To allow municipal governments&#13;
effectively assume their new responsibilities under LPP, the central Government increased&#13;
the amount of public revenues allocated to municipalities through co-participation funds.&#13;
For most municipalities, and almost all of those included in the target area of project&#13;
intervention, the availability of co-participation funds means a considerable increase in&#13;
revenues. The increase in municipal budgets is even more significant given their weak&#13;
administrative and financial management capacity. Strengthening the municipality's&#13;
administrative and financial management capabilities is therefore a crucial factor for&#13;
successful LPP implementation.&#13;
4.34         Municipal Administration. Municipal employees would be trained in the use&#13;
of an integrated accounting system (Sistema de ContabilidadIntegrada, SICOPRE)&#13;
which would enable them to keep track of transactions in relation to the municipal budget.&#13;
After training, SICOPRE would be installed in all 98 municipalities included in the project&#13;
area. Besides accounting, attention would be paid to train municipal employees in the&#13;
preparation of the municipal budget (PAO). Personnel management would be another&#13;
module within SNPP's program to improve municipal administration. Within this module,&#13;
attention would be paid to, among other: (i) recruitment and selection procedures;&#13;
(ii) remuneration scales; (iii) tenrs of reference; (iv) personnel evaluation procedures;&#13;
(v) training; and (vi) internal control.&#13;
4.35         Finance. The specific objective of training activities in the area of finance is&#13;
to strengthen the capacity of municipalities to raise and administer local taxes. Municipal&#13;
employees would be trained in: (i) setting-up and maintaining tax registers; (ii) collecting&#13;
and administering property taxes, taxes on vehicles, etc.; and (iii) preparing and&#13;
maintaining statistics on tax collection.&#13;
4.36         To implement these activities the project would finance SNPP training&#13;
activities and EE services for training and follow-up. To increase the capacity of&#13;
indigenous municipal districts to assume larger responsibilities in administrative and&#13;
financial management, SNPP would also ensure that representatives of such districts&#13;
participate in the above mentioned training modules.&#13;
Expected Results of the Institutional Strengthening Component&#13;
4.37         Implementation of the institutional strengthening component is expected to&#13;
generate the following results: (i) CORDES and EEs would be able to implement the PPP&#13;
in an additional 205 municipalities; (ii) ninety-eight municipalities would be able to adjust&#13;
their PMDs and PAOs after the 1995 municipal elections; (iii) community investment&#13;
proposals would better reflect PPP efforts as training of municipalities, CVs, and OTBs&#13;
progresses; (iv) technical training of EEs involved in project preparation would improve&#13;
the quality of proposals submitted to funding agencies for evaluation, thereby reducing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
processing time and costs; (v) decentralization efforts in FDC, coupled with the effects of&#13;
better quality project proposals, would reduce project processing time by fifty percent&#13;
from its current level of eight months; (vi) strengthening of SNDR would sustain and&#13;
institutionalize PPP efforts at the national level and ensure an institutional capacity to&#13;
facilitate implementation of these efforts in rural communities; (vii) SICOPRE would be&#13;
installed in 98 municipalities; and (viii) increased administrative and financial management&#13;
capacity in 98 municipalities and indigenous municipal districts indicated by effective and&#13;
full utilization of municipal co-participation funds.&#13;
IV.   Rural Investments (Base Costs US$13.2 million)&#13;
4.38         The project's investment component would provide funds to FDC to&#13;
finance sub-projects which meet the institutional objectives of the agency, have been&#13;
generated through a participatory planning process and are included in a municipal&#13;
development plan and/or annual operational plan. FDC would use its own eligibility&#13;
criteria and procedures to finance the investments and would use project resources for this&#13;
purpose. Beneficiary communities would contribute between 10 and 25 percent of total&#13;
investment costs, to be either paid in cash, in kind, or through provision of labor or in a&#13;
combination thereof The contribution would be in compliance with FDC's rules and&#13;
procedures are summarized below. Detailed FDC eligibility criteria and procedures are&#13;
described in Annex 9.&#13;
Sub-project Eligibility Criteria&#13;
4.39         Minimum eligibility criteria for sub-projects to be financed under the&#13;
project require that sub-projects: (i) are identified by rural communities through a&#13;
participatory process and included in the municipal development plan; (ii) are technically&#13;
feasible and have a minimum economic rate of return of 12 percent; (iii) include women as&#13;
participants and beneficiaries; (iv) have an environmental impact category II, III or IV'0 as&#13;
determined by the environmental laws; (v) can be constructed in less than one year; and&#13;
(vi) cost less than US$250,000. These criteria would be included in the Operational&#13;
Manual. Typical sub-projects would include basic infrastructure, production support,&#13;
institutional strengthening, and pre-investment studies.&#13;
4.40         Basic infrastructure sub-projects " include: (i) the rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of one-blade access roads costing less than US$15,000 per km and linking&#13;
remote communities in production zones to rural markets and feeder roads; (ii) vehicle and&#13;
walking bridges costing less than US$150,000 in areas where the bridge solves an access&#13;
problem; (iii) small-scale irrigation schemes not exceeding a cost of US$2,500 per ha; and&#13;
(iv) markets, storage centers and artisanal workshops up to a maximum of US$50,000 for&#13;
'° In case of category II sub-projects specific environmental mitigation measures would have&#13;
to be included in the sub-project design.&#13;
Basic infrastructure sub-projects would not be eligible for IFAD-financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
municipalities and communities paying for operation and maintenance. Markets would not&#13;
cost more than US$100 per square meter roof-covered.&#13;
4.41         Production support sub-projects comprise: (i) technical assistance and&#13;
extension services (including advisory services and training) for farmers and livestock&#13;
holders in natural resources management, agro-forestry, watershed management,&#13;
technology transfer, and farm management; (ii) management and administrative support&#13;
for OTBs; and (iii) assistance to produce marketing. Costs per sub-project should not&#13;
exceed US$150 per sub-project beneficiary. Moreover, up to a maximum US$250,000 of&#13;
the IFAD contribution could be used to finance small specific experiments and research&#13;
activities including adaptive agricultural research in communities to experiment with new&#13;
varieties and crops, agricultural processing and other similar activities. The cost of each&#13;
sub-project in this category would not exceed US$25,000.&#13;
4.42         Institutional strengthening sub-projects cover institutional strengthening&#13;
of the beneficiary communities including training to interchange experiences between&#13;
communities, contracting of technical assistance to improve the management and&#13;
organization of the OTBs, organization of workshops and seminars on community-&#13;
development related subjects and provision of tools and equipment to carry out the agreed&#13;
activities. The IFAD component would also finance institutional strengthening of ECs&#13;
including: (i) seminars and specific training in agriculture, rural infrastructure and other&#13;
fields which may improve the ECs performance; (ii) technical assistance in organization&#13;
and working methods, micro-regional diagnostics and elaboration of sub-project final&#13;
design studies; and (iii) equipment to carry out studies.&#13;
4.43        Local Human Resources Development Sub-projects. One particular&#13;
type of sub-project would be local human resources development aiming at enhancing the&#13;
capacity of rural communities to more effectively participate in the PPP and sub-project&#13;
preparation through training of selected individuals. Training activities could consist of&#13;
short courses, workshops, formal education, etc. It is envisaged that existing training&#13;
centers, often managed by NGOs, would act as executing agency for this type of sub-&#13;
projects. To finance these sub-projects a total of US$700,000 would provided to FDC.&#13;
However, if demand for this type of projects is lower than expected these resources would&#13;
be used to finance other types of sub-projects.&#13;
4.44        Pre-investment studies carried out by consultants recruited by ECs or by&#13;
the ECs themselves. These pre-investment studies refer to technical and feasibility studies&#13;
done after the sub-project profiles have been accepted by FDC.&#13;
4.45         Other Studies. COTESU would finance studies allowing FDC to explore&#13;
potential new directions of its investment portfolio in the medium-term future. Tentative&#13;
subjects to be covered by these studies include provision of financial services to&#13;
municipalities and alternatives of savings generation in rural areas.&#13;

Expected Results of the Rural Investment Component&#13;
4.48            The rural investment component is expected to: (i) increase FDC's&#13;
investment portfolio by approximately 700 sub-projects and a total of US$15 million,&#13;
including a minimum of 60 projects which respond to demands expressed in indigenous&#13;
district development sub-plans; (ii) improve the quality of FDC's investment portfolio as&#13;
sub-projects would fully reflect beneficiary participation; and (iii) increase the number and&#13;
competence of ECs involved in sub-project preparation and implementation.&#13;

5.    PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. Cost Estimates&#13;
5.1          The total project cost is estimated at US$31 million equivalent, including&#13;
taxes and duties. Base costs are US$28 million and contingencies are US$3 million. The&#13;
foreign exchange component is US$1.9 million, or six percent of the project costs.&#13;
Project costs are estimated at April 1995 prices. The breakdown of costs by component is&#13;
shown in Table 3 and by type of expenditure in Table 4. Detailed costs tables are&#13;
presented in Annex 11. Physical contingencies are included at eight percent of investment&#13;
costs. Price contingencies (averaging three percent of the base costs) were calculated on&#13;
the basis of the following inflation rates assumed for local costs and foreign exchange:&#13;

B. Proposed Financing Plan&#13;
5.2         The project would be financed by an IDA Credit, a Swiss Government&#13;
(COTESU) Grant, the Bolivian Government, a credit from LFAD the Government intends&#13;
to request, unidentified donors and beneficiary counterpart funds. The estimated value of&#13;
the IDA Credit would be US$15 million or 48 percent of project costs. LFAD would&#13;
contribute about US$4.9 million or 16 percent of project costs. The Swiss Government&#13;
(COTESU) would contribute US$1.7 million or 5 percent of project costs. Contributions&#13;
by Government would amount to US$4 million or 13 percent of project costs.&#13;
Municipalities and local communities would contribute US$2.0 million or 7 percent of&#13;
project costs. Non-identified cofinanciers would contribute US$3.4 million or 11 percent&#13;
of projects costs.&#13;

C. Financial Implications for Government&#13;
5.3         Recurrent Costs: During implementation Government would contribute&#13;
US$4 rnillion of which US$3.2 million would be covered through recuperation of income&#13;
and sales taxes. At completion, the project is expected to generate annual incremental&#13;
costs, totaling approximately US$850,000 per year. This amount could be financed&#13;
through the central budget and by recovery of FDC's administrative costs from&#13;
municipalities and international donors.&#13;

5.5         IDA would finance civil works, vehicles, equipment, training, service&#13;
contracts, consulting services and incremental operating costs. During negotiations, it&#13;
has been agreed that SNDR would use IDA standard bidding documents for&#13;
International Competitive Bidding procurement and bidding documents acceptable&#13;
to IDA for National Competitive Bidding (para. 8.1). In particular it has been agreed&#13;
that for procurement with IDA funds the Bolivian NCB procedures set forth in Supreme&#13;
Decree No. 23981 would be adjusted as follows: (i) the award of civil woks contracts&#13;
would be based exclusively on price and other factors such as time for completion;&#13;
(ii) except if IDA would otherwise agree, the bidding process would not be declared void&#13;
if only three bids or less have been submitted; (iii) any standards and technical&#13;
specifications (quoted in the bidding documents) which are at least substantially equivalent&#13;
to the national standards and technical specifications would be acceptable; (iv) foreign&#13;
bidders would be allowed to participate in NCB; (v) foreign bidders would not be required&#13;
to legalize any documentation related to their bids with Bolivian authorities as a&#13;
prerequisite of bidding; (vi) bidders who have requested to withdraw their bids prior to the&#13;
bid opening would be permitted to do so without any such penalty against such bidders--&#13;
the bids withdraws would be returned duly sealed to the bidders; (vii) no margin of&#13;
preference would be granted for any category of bidders; (viii) the auction procedure&#13;
(puja abierta) would not be used; (ix) in the event that a bidder whose bid was evaluated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
as the bid with the lowest evaluated cost withdraws its bid, the contract may be awarded&#13;
to the second lowest responsive evaluated bid; (x) foreign bidders would not, as a&#13;
condition for submitting bids, be required to enter into a joint venture agreement with&#13;
local bidders; (xi) no other procurement rules or regulations of Government agencies of&#13;
any state-owned entity would apply without the prior review and consent of IDA.&#13;
5.6         SNDR, FDC and SNPP would carry out procurement for their own&#13;
institutional strengthening sub-components. SNDR and FDC are familiar with IDA&#13;
procurement procedures and would assist SNPP. This procurement experience has been&#13;
gained through the management of the PPF and Japanese Grant funds. The project&#13;
director and financial manager of SNDR have- undergone procurement training courses in&#13;
Bolivia. FDC staff has acquired general procurement skills through working with IDB,&#13;
KfW and other donors. SNDR, FDC and SNPP staff would further up-date their skiDls in&#13;
IDA-organized procurement courses.&#13;
Civil Works, Goods and Equipment for Municipalities and OTBs (Sub-Projects)&#13;
5.7         Procurement for community-based civil works, goods and equipment&#13;
totaling US$8.6 million (of which IDA would finance US$4.4 million) would follow&#13;
commercial practices in accordance with FDC operational guidelines acceptable to IDA&#13;
and in accordance with the special provisions mentioned in para 5.5 above. FDC's normal&#13;
procedure is that procurement for community-based projects would be done by the&#13;
Executing Agency, the municipality, or the OTB, depending on the size and kind of&#13;
contract. For all works contracts exceeding US$125,000, national competitive bidding&#13;
would apply. Works of US$125,000 or less per contract up to a maximum aggregate of&#13;
US$2 million would be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a&#13;
written invitation. Goods for sub-projects shall not exceed US$50,000 per contract.&#13;
Goods for US$50,000 per contract or less and up to an aggregate amount of US$800,000&#13;
would be procured through national shopping.&#13;
5.8         Under the project, FDC's procedures for NCB would be modified. The&#13;
"two envelope" bid opening.would be replaced with a single public opening of both&#13;
technical and priced bids and announcement of the bid prices and discounts. The EC's&#13;
evaluation committee would carry out a post-qualification of the lowest responsive bidder&#13;
on the basis of minimum criteria mentioned in the bidding documents. If the lowest&#13;
responsive bidder would not qualify, the second-lowest responsive bidder would be&#13;
evaluated, etc. The present bracketing rule of discarding all proposals which are&#13;
15 percent below the FDC cost estimate would be abandoned. Adoption by FDC of&#13;
revised NCB procurement procedures acceptable to IIDA would be a condition of&#13;
disbursement of expenditure categories 1, 3(b), 4(c) and 8 of Table 6 (paras. 5.18&#13;
and 8.3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Small Civil Works for Implementing Agencies.&#13;
5.9         Civil works (other than for community-based investments) expected not to&#13;
exceed US$25,000 equivalent per contract, and not to exceed US$100,000 in the&#13;
aggregate, would also be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a&#13;
written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works,&#13;
including basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement&#13;
acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to&#13;
the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has&#13;
experience and resources to complete the contract successfully.&#13;
Goods and Equipment for Implementing Agencies.&#13;
5.10        Total costs of goods and equipment (other than for community-based&#13;
investments) is estimated at US$1 million. This amount includes vehicles, office&#13;
equipment, furniture and supplies for SNDR and FDC. Vehicles and computer equipment&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$125,000 per contract and worth about US$400,000&#13;
would be purchased through ICB. Other office equipment, furniture and supplies,&#13;
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$125,000 or less per contract, but more than the&#13;
equivalent of US$50,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$300,000 would be procured&#13;
through NCB. Goods and equipment, estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or&#13;
less, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$300,000 may be procured through price&#13;
comparison of at least three eligible suppliers.&#13;
Consulting and Management Services.&#13;
5.11        Consulting and Management Services under the project would amnount to&#13;
US$17.5 million (of which IDA would finance US$7.0 million). The services consist of:&#13;
(i) consulting assignments for individuals and firms providing direct technical assistance&#13;
and consulting services to SNDR, FDC and SNPP (US$3.1 million); and (ii) management&#13;
and technical assistance services by individuals, NGOs or firms to rural communities&#13;
(US$14.4 million). Consulting and management services would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the 1981 IDA Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.&#13;
5.12        Consulting assignments would amount to US$3.1 million (of which IDA&#13;
would finance US$2.5 million). Most assignments would be small and straightforward.&#13;
SNDR, FDC and SNPP would recruit individual consultants from a shortlist of at least&#13;
three candidates for each post. A sample letter of invitation, award criteria and a sample&#13;
contract, all acceptable to IDA, would be included in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
5.13        Management Services by Executing Agencies would amount to&#13;
US$5 million (of which IDA would finance US$4.5 million). In order to give beneficiaries&#13;
a broad range of executing agencies from which to select, SNDR would advertise&#13;
nationally to develop a roster of potential sources of management services for community-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
based sub-projects. These EEs would be recruited as follows: (i) SNDR would invite,&#13;
every year and through newspaper advertising, NGOs and other organizations to show&#13;
interest to participate in the project; (ii) on the basis of minimum criteria (outlined in para.&#13;
4.14), SNDR would establish a roster of organizations with appropriate capabilities;&#13;
(iii) for each assignment, beneficiaries would select at least three organizations included in&#13;
the roster to be invited to present technical and financial proposals for the services; and&#13;
(iv) SNDR would award contracts on the basis of criteria acceptable to IDA and taking&#13;
price into account. Award criteria and evaluation procedures would be included in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual. The establishment of a roster of executing agencies,&#13;
based on standard minimum criteria, would be a condition of project effectiveness&#13;
(para. 8.2).&#13;
5.14         Management Services by Cooperating Agencies are considered sub-&#13;
projects and would be procured by FDC in accordance with its own procedures,&#13;
acceptable to IDA. OTBs and municipalities normally select a EC and propose its&#13;
financing by FDC, which evaluates the capacity of the proposed EC in three steps. First,&#13;
FDC evaluates the EC's legal status: official organizational status and declaration of fully&#13;
empowered representative(s). Second, FDC's Departmental representative undertakes a&#13;
technical evaluation which requires at least one site visit and takes into consideration the&#13;
EC's capability to execute the contract satisfactorily, based on its experience, available&#13;
human resources and equipment, and its ties with the beneficiary community. The third&#13;
step is to examine whether the EC proposal fits within FDC's financial limits.&#13;
5.15         Review Procedures. The prior review arrangements proposed below&#13;
would ensure prior review by IDA of approximately 50 percent of the total value of IDA-&#13;
financed contracts.&#13;
5.16         Review of Procurement by Implementing Agencies. IDA would conduct a&#13;
prior review of: (i) all procurement exceeding US$125,000 per contract; (ii) procurement&#13;
for the first contracts for civil works (other than works procured under a sub-grant) and&#13;
for goods under NCB; (iii) consultant selection documentation (terms of reference,&#13;
shortlists, contract, etc.) for EE and EC management service contracts and consulting&#13;
services directly recruited by SNDR, FDC and SNPP with an estimated contract amount&#13;
of US$50,000 or more for firms and US$15,000 or more for individuals; (iv) terms of&#13;
reference for all other EE services/consulting services contracts; and (v) all contracts&#13;
based on a single-source or of critical nature.&#13;
5.17         Review of Procurement for Rural Investments. IDA would carry out a&#13;
prior review of all civil works contracts exceeding US$125,000 and a post-review of all&#13;
other procurement by ECs and communities. For this purpose, FDC would recruit&#13;
auditors who would not only examine financial implementation but also procurement&#13;
procedures, physical implementation and impact on the beneficiaries. These auditors&#13;
would carry out six-monthly audits on the basis of a sample not lower than 60 percent of&#13;
the IDA and IFAD-financed investments in the first project year, 50 percent in the second&#13;
and 40 percent in the last years. For convenience and to avoid overlaps, the same auditors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
would carry out an ex-post review of the expenditures and investments financed by IDA,&#13;
IFAD, IDB and KfW. Terms of reference of these auditors, acceptable to IDA, would be&#13;
agreed upon with the other donors.&#13;
E. Disbursement&#13;
5.18         IDA credit of US$15 nillion is expected to be disbursed over a period of&#13;
3.5 years, beginning the second quarter of IDA FY96 through the end of IDA FY1999.&#13;
The project completion date would be December 31, 1998 and the closing date would be&#13;
June 30, 1999. The disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 12. The disbursement&#13;
pace is faster than the historical disbursement profile for Bolivia's agricultural projects&#13;
because of a US$2 million PPF to be refinanced and the expectation that quick disbursing&#13;
infrastructure sub-projects would make up a considerable proportion of the project's rural&#13;
investment component. The disbursement pace would depend on the quality of sub-&#13;
project preparation and FDC's administrative capacities.&#13;

5.19         Adoption by FDC of procurement arrangements and a&#13;
decentralization plan acceptable to IDA and the signing of an agreement between&#13;
FDC and MDSMA allowing FDC to carry out environmental assessments (para 7.9)&#13;
would be conditions of disbursement for categories 1, 3(b),4(c) and 8 of Table 6&#13;
(para. 8.4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
5.20        Rural investments would include civil works, goods, equipment, technical&#13;
assistance and management services for eligible beneficiaries. Training includes the cost of&#13;
the trainers' and trainees' fees, rental of conference rooms, per diem and transport of&#13;
trainees and materials required for the training activities. Consulting and management&#13;
services include contracts to carry out: (i) training; (ii) extension; (iii) follow-up on the&#13;
participatory planning; and (iv) pre-investment studies. Incremental operating&#13;
expenditures include expenditures for transport, office rental, materials and supplies,&#13;
incremental salaries, contract labor, utilities, building and equipment maintenance, field&#13;
materials and field allowances. FDC's administrative costs are maximum seven percent of&#13;
disbursements under category 1, rural investments, for services rendered by FDC in&#13;
providing sub-grants..&#13;
5.21        Documentation of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made on the&#13;
basis of full documentation for all expenditures made under contracts requiring prior&#13;
review by IDA and amendments to contracts raising the value of such contracts above the&#13;
prior review limits. These contracts are: (i) all contracts exceeding US$125,000; (ii) the&#13;
first contracts for civil works (other than works procured under a sub-grant) and for&#13;
goods under NCB; (iii) consultant and management service contracts directly procured by&#13;
SNDR, FDC and SNPP with an estimated contract amount of US$50,000 or more for&#13;
firms and US$15,000 or more for individuals; and (iv) all contracts based on single-source&#13;
or of a sensitive nature. For all other expenditures disbursements would be made against&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for which supporting documents would be maintained&#13;
by SNDR or FDC and would be available for IDA staff review. Because of the large&#13;
volume of disbursements expected to be claimed under SOEs, special efforts would be&#13;
made for the selective review of SOE documentation by visiting IDA missions and&#13;
auditors.&#13;

5.22        Special Account. Two Special Accounts in US dollars would be opened&#13;
at the Central Bank of Bolivia. Special Account "A" would be opened for SNDR and&#13;
SNPP expenditures. Special Account "B" would be opened for FDC and community-&#13;
based expenditures through FDC. Both accounts would have an authorized allocation of&#13;
each US$0.6 million and would cover four months of project expenditures. The&#13;
authorized allocation would be limited to US$300,000 each until the combined credit&#13;
withdrawals have reached US$5 million. Withdrawals from the Special Account "A"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
would be done by SNDR, from Special Account "B" by FDC. IDA would replenish the&#13;
Special Account for the amount of withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at the&#13;
request of the Borrower.&#13;
5.23        Retroactive Financing. Reimbursement of up to SDR960,000 (about&#13;
US$1.4 million equivalent) would be permitted for eligible expenditures made in&#13;
accordance with procurement procedures agreed under the project from January 1, 1995,&#13;
provided that the Credit is signed not later than December 31, 1995. If the Credit is&#13;
signed at a later date, the initial date for eligibility of expenditures for retroactive financing&#13;
would be modified so that the period covered by retroactive financing would be no more&#13;
than one year. Retroactive financing is recommended to ensure that training and the&#13;
institutional strengthening of SNDR and SNPP to enable further implementation of the&#13;
PPP would not be disrupted because of a financing gap between completion of the pilot&#13;
project and the effectiveness of the Credit.&#13;
F. Auditing and Accounts&#13;
5.24        The implementing agencies would maintain separate accounts for project&#13;
expenditures as well as a register of assets purchased with project funds. SNDR would&#13;
include SNPP project expenditures into its project accounts and records. FDC would&#13;
maintain separate accounts. SNDR would hire independent auditors satisfactory to IDA&#13;
to audit its own financial statements, the Special Account and SOEs. In addition, the&#13;
auditors would prepare a (long-form) report on project management. Copies of the&#13;
audited statements would be sent to IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
With respect to SOEs, the auditor's reports would include an opinion (and comments and&#13;
recommendations, as necessary) on the methods employed in compiling the SOEs, their&#13;
accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, their eligibility for financing under the&#13;
terms of the Credit agreement, the standards of record keeping and internal controls&#13;
related to the foregoing.&#13;
5.25        FDC accounts and SOEs would be audited through an annual audit&#13;
financed by all donors, including IDA. FDC would hire independent auditors who would&#13;
cover not only the financial aspects of FDC management as defined in the above paragraph&#13;
but also the physical implementation of the rural investment component as referred to in&#13;
para. 5.17. Detailed terms of reference for such combined financial and technical audit&#13;
would be included in the Operational Manual after agreement with other donors financing&#13;
rural investments through FDC. Audits of SNDR and FDC would be financed under the&#13;
Project. Auditing and accounting arrangements of SNDR and FDC have been&#13;
agreed upon during negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.   Project Management&#13;
6.1         SNDR would coordinate the implementation of the project through its&#13;
General Coordination Unit. SNDR would be directly responsible for the rural investment&#13;
identification and formulation and training components. SNDR, FDC and SNPP would&#13;
carry out their own institutional strengthening sub-components. FDC would implement&#13;
the rural investment component. SNPP would be responsible the municipal strengthening&#13;
sub-component.&#13;
6.2          The organization division of SNDR's Sub-secretariat for Social Promotion&#13;
would follow-up on PPP, municipal annual operational plan design, and PPP adjustment.&#13;
Its training division would design, implement and evaluate training activities. The project&#13;
would finance four consultants (to be reduced to two persons in the second year of the&#13;
project) at the national level to be responsible to prepare and monitor the training&#13;
contracts for PPP and the EEs. Terms of reference of consultants would be included in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual. SNDR's Sub-secretariat for Production Promotion&#13;
would be responsible for coordinating access by communities to sources of technical&#13;
expertise. The National Secretariat for Ethnic, Gender and Youth Affairs (SNEGG)&#13;
would provide conceptual support on indigenous people to SNDR. The Sub-secretariat&#13;
for Gender Affairs would be introduce and maintain gender related issues into the project.&#13;
6.3         The General Coordinating Unit is SNDR's administrative arm which would&#13;
monitor project procurement and disbursement procedures. In addition, this Unit&#13;
supervises SNDR's Departmental Offices and coordinates with relevant institutions,&#13;
especially FDC. The project would strengthen SNDR's administrative division with local&#13;
consultants (including a project administrator in charge of procurement and an&#13;
accountant). Terms of reference of the coordination unit's consultants have been agreed&#13;
upon during appraisal and are to be included in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
6.4         SNDR's Departmental offices would have responsibility for administering&#13;
the PPP process, organizing/facilitating pre-investment studies, and would supervise the&#13;
service contracts in the field. On the basis of the consolidated needs of the municipalities,&#13;
the Departmental offices would prepare annual work programs and budgets for direct&#13;
SNDR services, as well as contracted services.&#13;
6.5         FDC would carry out the rural investment component. The Government&#13;
would transfer to FDC, on a grant basis, the proceeds allocated to the investment&#13;
component through a subsidiary agreement. This agreement would contain, inter alia,&#13;
FDC's obligations to finance eligible sub-projects and strengthen its institutional capacity,&#13;
basic procurement rules, environmental and monitoring aspects. The signature of the&#13;
project subsidiary agreement between the Government and FDC would be a&#13;
condition of project effectiveness (para. 8.2).&#13;

6.6           FDC would finance rural investments through sub-grant agreements. The&#13;
sub-grant agreements would require the beneficiaries to: (i) carry out sub-projects with&#13;
due diligence and efficiency and in accordance with sound administrative, technical,&#13;
engineering, financial, ecological and environmental standards; (ii) finance at least 10&#13;
percent (but up to 30 percent) of the sub-project costs in cash, kind, labor or by means of&#13;
any combination thereof, and (iii) mitigate any negative environmental impact of the sub-&#13;
project. The sub-grant agreement would suspend or terminate the rights of the&#13;
beneficiaries to use project funds if they would fail to comply with their obligations. The&#13;
signature of a sub-grant agreement, acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of&#13;
disbursement for each sub-project (para. 8.3).&#13;
6.7            SNPP would employ the services of individual consultants and specialized&#13;
consulting firms under management services agreements to carry out the institutional&#13;
strengthening of municipalities.&#13;
B. Project Implementation&#13;
6.8           Implementation Plan. The overall project implementation plan including&#13;
a training plan has been prepared during appraisal. This overall project implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
plan and a detailed first year implementation plan has been agreed upon during&#13;
negotiations (para. 8.1). A draft plan is presented in Annex 13. By November 15 of&#13;
each year, SNDR, FDC, SNPP would present a project implementation plan for the&#13;
following year, satisfactory to IDA. SNDR would coordinate the preparation of such&#13;
plans with FDC and SNPP. During negotiations, agreement has been reached that&#13;
SNDR and FDC would prepare annual implementation plans satisfactory to IDA&#13;
(para. 8.1).&#13;
6.9         Operational Manual. SNDR, FDC and SNPP would prepare a common&#13;
detailed Project Operational Manual. This manual would contain: (i) eligibility criteria for&#13;
sub-projects, beneficiaries, Executing and Cooperating Agencies and a format of a sub-&#13;
grant agreement; (ii) project implementation plan and monitoring indicators; (iii) project&#13;
management, co-ordination and reporting aspects; (iv) procedures for procurement of civil&#13;
works, goods, consultants and management services and sample bidding documents; (v)&#13;
disbursement procedures; (vi) terms of reference of key consultants and sample consulting&#13;
and management service contracts; (vii) the training program; (viii) accounting systems&#13;
and audit aspects; and (ix) the environmental criteria to be used by FDC in carrying out&#13;
environmental assessments of sub-projects. The manual would be reviewed by IDA.&#13;
SNDR, FDC and SNPP's adoption of the Project Operational Manual, acceptable to&#13;
IDA, would be a condition of project effectiveness (para. 8.2).&#13;
C. Project Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
6.10        Project implementation progress would be monitored by SNDR's internal&#13;
monitoring unit. IDA and Government would monitor the project's progress during joint&#13;
supervision missions, a Mid-Term Review and an Implementation Completion Review.&#13;
Government would also organize a project launching workshop upon project&#13;
effectiveness. Project monitoring and supervision arrangements have been agreed&#13;
upon during negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
6.11        Monitoring: SNDR's Planning and Monitoring Unit would monitor&#13;
overall project progress and provide six-monthly reports (June 30 and December 3 1) to&#13;
the Minister of Human Development, the Minister of Sustainable Development and&#13;
Environment, the Minister of the Presidency and IDA. SNDR would integrate the FDC&#13;
and SNPP reports in the overall progress reports. The reports would contain information&#13;
on progress with: (i) the Participatory Planning Process and the EE's organization of&#13;
workshops and seminars in the field; (ii) training; (iii) institutional strengthening; and&#13;
(iv) feasibility studies and investments. The reports would also flag problems which need&#13;
the attention of the Ministries and/or IDA. The reports would be furnished to IDA no&#13;
later than two months after the completion of each semester. Progress would be measured&#13;
against a set of key monitoring indicators as presented in Annex 13.&#13;
6.12        Project Launching Workshop. Upon project effectiveness, Government&#13;
would organize a project launching workshop to which all project stakeholders in the&#13;
project would be invited. The workshop would explain and discuss: (i) the overall project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
concept and content; (ii) project organization and implementation; (iii) procurement and&#13;
disbursement aspects; (iv) audit requirements; (v) project supervision and reviews;&#13;
(vi) communications with IDA; and (vii) other subjects of particular relevance.&#13;
6.13        Regular Supervision. Twice a year, the Government and IDA would&#13;
organize joint project supervision missions. Project supervision would essentially provide&#13;
implementation assistance. Before each mission, Government and IDA would agree on&#13;
the major subjects to be supervised, which would always include an evaluation of the&#13;
project's progress based on the monitoring indicators, compliance with legal covenants,&#13;
and procurement and financial management supervision. At the end of each mission,&#13;
Government and IDA would sign an Aide Memoire which would contain the major&#13;
agreements reached during the mission. Annex 14 provides more details on supervision.&#13;
6.14        Mid-Term Review (MTR). During the 24th month after the effectiveness&#13;
date, Government and IDA would carry out a Mid-Term Review. Three months before&#13;
such review would take place, Government and IDA would agree on detailed terms of&#13;
reference and staffing of the MTR team. In particular, the MTR would analyze: (i) PPP&#13;
field implementation and active participation of communities; (ii) identification and&#13;
formulation of rural investments; (iii) impact of the Executive Agency training on EE&#13;
performance; (iv) FDC's decentralization efforts and delegation of authority to the&#13;
Departmental offices; (v) FDC sub-project portfolio; (vi) SNPP's municipal strengthening&#13;
program; (vii) institutional strengthening and the increasing financing by Government of&#13;
SNDR's operating costs; and (viii) procurement, disbursement and financial aspects.&#13;
Following this review, the Government through SNDR would, within forty-five days of&#13;
the review, draw up an action plan, satisfactory to IDA, to make adjustments in project&#13;
implementation wherever necessary and promptly carry out the action plan. The Mid-&#13;
Term Review arrangements have been agreed upon during negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
6.15        Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Not later than six months&#13;
after the project closing date, the Government and IDA would carry out a joint project&#13;
completion review and produce an Implementation Review Report. Following this&#13;
review, the Government would present to IDA a plan for the future operation of the&#13;
project, furnish the plan to IDA for comments, and carry out the plan taking into account&#13;
IDA's comments thereon.&#13;
7. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benerits&#13;
7.1         The proposed project would provide the initial support to a long-term&#13;
Government strategy generating participatory demand for rural investments as well as&#13;
their implementation through a major capacity building effort. Expected benefits of the&#13;
project would be: (i) an increase in the level and sustainability of small-scale rural&#13;
development investments; (ii) capacity enhancement of private and public development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
institutions at the national, municipal and community levels; (iii) empowerment of local&#13;
grassroots organizations; and (iv) improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of&#13;
funding agencies operating in the rural sector.&#13;
7.2         By responding more efficiently to the demand for rural investments,&#13;
improving the institutional capacity to prepare projects following the format of local&#13;
funding agencies, and assisting in the actual preparation of a considerable number of sub-&#13;
projects, the project would lift one of the major bottlenecks for the financing of rural&#13;
investments and significantly increase the investment pipeline of the funding agencies. As&#13;
the communities would have more ownership of the sub-projects, the commitment to&#13;
maintain the investments would also be higher. Experience in other countries and in the&#13;
region suggests that the sustainability of the investments financed under this project, given&#13;
the degree of beneficiary participation in selection and implementation, would be high.&#13;
7.3          The project would provide training in 98 municipalities, thereby covering&#13;
approximately 4,000 communities and at least one hundred private development&#13;
institutions. Their improved capacity to manage the PPP and the preparation of projects&#13;
would enable them to increasingly take the planning and implementation of development&#13;
efforts in their own hands. The project would benefit at least 200,000 rural families&#13;
mostly of indigenous origin.&#13;
7.4          The project would also improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the&#13;
funding agencies, in particular FDC. The decentralization of its operations could have a&#13;
significant impact on its accessibility and effectiveness in the rural areas. At the same&#13;
time, demand generation efforts are expected to increase the quality of project proposals&#13;
submitted to FDC, thereby decreasing project evaluation time and costs.&#13;
7.5         The project is expected to produce important additional benefits, such as:&#13;
(i) strengthened Government ability to formulate and evaluate social policy, particularly in&#13;
rural development, poverty alleviation and food security; (ii) development of partnership&#13;
and complementary among public services, NGOs, municipalities, and rural communities;&#13;
(iii) reinforcement of Government's initiatives to recognize the important role played by&#13;
women in rural economy; and (iv) increased capacity of municipalities in administrative&#13;
and financial management.&#13;
7.6          Productive investments would have important economic and financial&#13;
benefits. Cost-benefit analysis of some typical projects financed by FDC show financial&#13;
and economic rate of returns of more than 12 percent. For all investment and institutional&#13;
strengthening components the costs have been reduced to a minimum.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
7.7         The project faces three risks. First, project implementation calls for the&#13;
involvement and support of numerous central and local government and private agencies,&#13;
most of which have weak management and poor coordination amongst them. Because of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
the institutional weaknesses, PPP follow-up and sub-project design approval may become&#13;
overly complex and be based upon criteria unrelated to the project's technical merits.&#13;
Second, the implementation of the participatory planning process is ambitious and&#13;
difficult. The preparatory phases, financed under the pilot project, are relatively easy to&#13;
implement compared with the painstaking process of design and adjustment of the&#13;
municipal development plans and implementation. Third, there is a possibility that the&#13;
demand generated by the project might outstrip both Cooperating Agencies' capability to&#13;
transform this demand in bankable projects as well as FDC's disbursing capacities,&#13;
creating unsatisfied expectations among communities and reducing project impact.&#13;
7.8          The above risks would be mitigated as follows. First, the project itself&#13;
aims at strengthening the management capacity of the institutions involved. The project's&#13;
institutional building component would increase the administrative and managerial abilities&#13;
of SNDR, particularly in its regional offices, FDC and ECs. The experience of the pilot&#13;
project would facilitate coordination among government agencies. Most training activities&#13;
would be carried out by the local and/or international private sector and would focus on&#13;
management improvement. Strict adherence to the technical criteria for sub-project&#13;
eligibility by the funding agencies would provide transparency in the project selection&#13;
process and avoid concentration of sub-projects in specific Departments. Second, the&#13;
participatory process itself would be continuously modified to improve its effectiveness&#13;
and minimize implementation difficulties. IDA missions would review PPP&#13;
implementation during supervision. Third, the project design comprises three sub-&#13;
components to assist in sub-project preparation. While a technical training has been&#13;
designed to improve ECs' capabilities, a technical assistance sub-component would help to&#13;
solve the more urgent problems, while financing pre-investment studies would facilitate&#13;
sub-project preparation. The project would also assist FDC strengthening the presence&#13;
and authority of its Departmental offices to assure more rapid disbursements.&#13;
C. Environmental Impact&#13;
7.9         The project's environmental category is B. The project would contribute&#13;
to the implementation of various kinds of sub-projects, some with possible negative impact&#13;
on the environment and others with clear positive impact. The improvement of access&#13;
roads and the construction of small scale irrigation works, storage facilities, etc., could&#13;
create localized environmental problems. Sub-projects of integrated watershed&#13;
management, forestry, pasture management, etc., would generate positive environmental&#13;
impacts. The training and capacity-building components would include sustainable natural&#13;
resource management, thus generating a long-term benefits for the environment. Further,&#13;
by intervening in the poorest areas of the country, and promoting the development of&#13;
income generating activities, the project would reduce environmental abuses induced by&#13;
poverty, such as deforestation, abbreviated fallow periods and over-grazing, and would&#13;
limit rural exodus and environmental problems in urban slums. Environmental aspects of&#13;
all sub-projects would be carefully reviewed during feasibility studies and, when&#13;
appropriate, mitigation measures would be designed for implementation. A list of possible&#13;
environmental impacts and mitigation measures is given in Annex 10. During appraisal it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
was verified that environmental assessment procedures of FDC are in line with IDA&#13;
requirements. Signing of an agreement between FDC and MDSMA, allowing FDC to&#13;
carry out environmental impact assessments under norms and guidelines of&#13;
MDSMA acceptable to IDA would be a condition of disbursement of disbursement&#13;
categories 1,3(b), 4(c) and 8 of Table 6, para. 5.18 (para. 8.3).&#13;
D. Impact on Women&#13;
7.10        Despite their dominant role in household affairs, cultural practices,&#13;
exacerbated by the high incidence of illiteracy, have prevented women from actively&#13;
participating in community decision-making. While women are permitted to attend&#13;
communal assemblies, their presence, with few exceptions, is figurative. In addition,&#13;
unlike men who receive documentation upon military conscription, most women do not&#13;
have proper identification papers, precluding them from, among other things, voting in&#13;
local or national elections.&#13;
7.11        The project would be an important vehicle to begin integrating women into&#13;
Bolivian political and civil affairs by increasing their active participation in the&#13;
implementation of the Popular Participation Law, particularly in the participatory planning&#13;
process and in the implementation of PMDs. By requiring that one of the community-&#13;
designated facilitators be a woman, the project would ensure that one woman is capable of&#13;
explaining to other women the PPP process and encouraging their participation.&#13;
7.12        Although SNDR aims to integrate a gender focus in all project activities,&#13;
specific activities have been defined to ensure such integration at the operational level.&#13;
These activities include: (i) evaluating the participatory planning process and the&#13;
Municipal Development Plans from a gender perspective; (ii) supporting the participation&#13;
of women in the registration of OTBs and the formation of Comites de Vigilancia;&#13;
(iii) supporting the implementation and adjustment of PMDs from a gender perspective;&#13;
and (iv) supporting the implementation of a training program focusing on gender issues.&#13;
7.13        A multi-institutional team consisting of specialists from SNDR's central&#13;
office, the central office of the Sub-Secretaria de Asuntos de Genero (SAG) and their&#13;
Departmental offices would implement this program in 14 pilot municipalities. The results&#13;
of the program would be integrated in SNDR's activities as defined under the project's&#13;
Rural Investment Identification and Formulation and Training components. The ultimate&#13;
aim of incorporating a gender perspective in the project activities is to increase the number&#13;
of sub-projects financed by FDC which particularly focus on women in development&#13;
issues. SNDR contracts with EEs would stipulate that opportunities to include women-&#13;
oriented sub-projects into the PMDs should be fully explored.&#13;
E. Poverty Category and Social Impact&#13;
7.14        The chief objective of the project is to increase rural household incomes&#13;
and alleviate poverty through sound and sustainable investments, identified by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
communities through a participatory planning process. The project would target poor&#13;
rural communities and improve the efficiency of public investment in the poorest rural&#13;
areas of the country. To sustain participation, the project would help build stable social-&#13;
organization structures within the rural communities. The project's main social impacts&#13;
would be to: (i) empower local communities; (ii) enhance community decision-making;&#13;
and (iii) improve dialogue and coordination between Government and rural communities.&#13;
7.15         The project would, through financial and technical assistance, increase&#13;
those investments which address the crucial constraints to rural development, including&#13;
social and productive infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation, health and education&#13;
facilities. Through the project, investments to increase rural productivity and diversify&#13;
production, such as extension services, technology transfers and formal and informal&#13;
education would expand. Effectiveness and sustainability of these investments would be&#13;
enhanced by the active participation of the poor communities in project formulation and&#13;
implementation.&#13;
F. Indigenous Peoples&#13;
7.16         It is estimated that over 90 percent of the project's potential beneficiaries&#13;
are of indigenous origin, the vast majority of them being either Quechua or Aymara.&#13;
However, a more careful analysis of the ethnic background of the project's potential&#13;
beneficiaries shows that the project area includes 18 different indigenous groups (see&#13;
Annex 2 for details). These groups are being represented by a variety of indigenous&#13;
organizations, most of them will actively participate in the project as OTBs.&#13;
7.17         Government's strategy to promote broad participation of the rural&#13;
population in local development planning would empower people at the local level to&#13;
influence and better control their physical, social and political environment. Involvement&#13;
in local planning and decision-making would integrate the hitherto largely segregated rural&#13;
population into the national state by facilitating their identification with national&#13;
institutions and the application of national legal and administrative regulations. To avoid&#13;
that these new powers erode the rural society's traditional forms of organization and&#13;
representation, and weaken social integration, the project would: (i) support the&#13;
formation of indigenous municipal districts; (ii) strengthen indigenous organizations;&#13;
(iii) finance the formulation of district development sub-plans; and (iv) support the&#13;
preparation of standard project profiles which reflect specific demands of indigenous&#13;
peoples expressed in district development sub-plans (see Annex 2 for details).&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Participatory Planning Process&#13;
1.          This annex describes the objectives, methodology, and phasing of the&#13;
Participatory Planning Process (PPP).&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.          Government seeks the active participation of the rural population in&#13;
planning, design, negotiation, execution and supervision of rural investments. The PPP is&#13;
designed to facilitate community and municipal organizations to be effective players in the&#13;
new development scheme, as outlined in the Popular Participation Law (Ley de&#13;
Participaci6n Popular, LPP). The PPP objectives are to: (i) contribute to the&#13;
decentralization of decision-taking; (ii) stimulate grassroots participation in local planning&#13;
and demand generation; (iii) help rural communities formulate Municipal Development&#13;
Plans (Plan Municipal de Desarrollo - PMD); and (iv) increase investment sustainability&#13;
by intensifying stakeholders' commitment in the implementation of rural investments.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
3.          The PPP methodology has been developed by SNDR, drawing on the&#13;
practical experiences of NGOs and benefiting from the procedures developed by the Latin&#13;
American Faculty for Social Sciences, COTESU, the GTZ's Goal-Oriented Project&#13;
Planning, and the Dutch technical cooperation. The methodology takes also into account&#13;
the lessons learned from the pilot project financed by an IDA PPF.&#13;
4.          The methodology consists of seven, two to five days provincial and&#13;
municipal workshops, and is given over the course of 13 months. At the workshops, the&#13;
Executing Agency helps the participants formulate PMDs. Workshop participants are&#13;
community delegates and representatives of development organizations.&#13;
5.          After each workshop, time is allotted for the community delegates to return&#13;
inform the community of the workshop proceedings, and receive community feedback. As&#13;
community decisions are taken by consensus, this process can be lengthy and tedious.&#13;
6.          The PPP costs an estimated US$40,000 per municipality. Exact duration&#13;
and cost of the process depend on: (i) maturity of the local organizations;&#13;
(ii) homogeneity of the rural communities; (iii) time availability of community members - a&#13;
function of cropping seasons and employment patterns; and (iv) EE capabilities and&#13;
commitment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Description of the PPP Stages&#13;
7.           The PPP has five stages: (i) Preparatory Phase; (ii) Community&#13;
Diagnostic; (iii) Municipal Development Plan; (iv) Follow-up to the Plan; and (v) Sub-&#13;
project Preparation (see Figure 1).&#13;
Stage One: Preparatory Phase&#13;
8.          In the preparatory phase two provincial workshops are given over a two-&#13;
month period. SNDR and an Executing Agency (EE) identify and invite municipal&#13;
authorities, local and private development agencies, OTBs, church entities and NGOs to&#13;
two preparatory PPP workshops through radio, local newspapers and announcements.&#13;
9.           The first preparatory workshop introduces the participants to the PPP&#13;
concepts, explaining their purpose and methodology. For many participants, this is a first&#13;
opportunity to learn the PPP-principles, its cycle and the roles of the various social, civic&#13;
and technical organizations. During the workshop, SNDR and EE assess institutional&#13;
strengthening needs of the local organizations and identify individuals requiring training.&#13;
At the second preparatory workshop, the concepts presented in the first workshop are&#13;
made operational. The EE assigns detailed work plans with specific responsibilities and&#13;
time schedules to participants, and distributes special audio-visual aides and questionnaires&#13;
to the community-delegates to help them explain PPP to their community.&#13;
Stage Two: Community Diagnostic&#13;
10.         Purposes of the community diagnostic are to: (i) help the communities to&#13;
better perceive their economic and social strengths and weaknesses in view of formulating&#13;
achievable socio-economic goals; (ii) improve the dialogue and linkages between&#13;
communities and municipal authorities; and (iii) convey to communities their expanded&#13;
prerogatives and responsibilities related to their own development as described in the LPP.&#13;
11.         The community diagnostic stage consists of two workshops conducted&#13;
during a three-month period. Participants are community-delegates and local people&#13;
involved in development activities. During the first community diagnostic workshop,&#13;
participatory rural appraisal techniques are used to facilitate the community in the&#13;
identification of constraints, causes and solutions.&#13;
12.         The participatory rural appraisal'2 techniques include: (i) interviews;&#13;
(ii) participatory mapping exercises, which positions socio-economic information on a&#13;
map, creates consensus and facilitates communications; (iii) seasonal calendar, showing&#13;
rainfall patterns, crop sequencing, seasonal labor demand and availability; (iv) historical&#13;

profiles and time trends, concerning changes in social organization, income opportunities&#13;
and natural resource use; and (v) short, simple questionnaires, concerning socio-economic&#13;
situation to be completed by the whole community before the following workshop.&#13;
13.          The EEs complement the information collected from the workshops with&#13;
information from secondary sources--such as reports, maps, aerial photographs, and other&#13;
documents--to produce a first draft of a community profile. Such profile describes the&#13;
municipality's natural resources, social structure and economic base with an inventory of:&#13;
(a) natural and topographical conditions, including climate, rainfall, soil types, land use&#13;
and flora and fauna; (b) social data, including size and age structure of the population,&#13;
number of families, economic activity, migration, birth and death rate and social&#13;
organizations; (c) level and quality of basic public services, such as access to sewage,&#13;
running water and latrine, type of housing, health facilities and schools; (d) economic data&#13;
concerning land tenure, land use, availability of irrigation, area cultivated with specific&#13;
crops, use of tools, machinery, fertilizer and seeds, storage facilities, agricultural calendar,&#13;
participation of family labor, degree of product transformation, and share of harvest&#13;
marketed, consumed by the family and stored. In addition, specific information is included&#13;
on the extent of natural plantations, type and size of livestock herds, use of livestock&#13;
products, animal health and division of family labor in activities related to livestock; and&#13;
(e) available communication media, transportation means and energy sources.&#13;
14.          During the second diagnostic workshop, the community discusses possible&#13;
solutions to its socio-economic constraints on the basis of the profile, identifies desirable&#13;
community investments and formulates a community investment program which is&#13;
submitted to the municipality. The process starts with community members listing&#13;
investment ideas, and estimating their feasibility, costs and impacts. The delegates work&#13;
with the community to rank the sub-project ideas and to formulate an investment plan.&#13;
Stage Three: Municipal Development Plan (PMD)&#13;
15.          This stage is PPP's core activity. It is carried out during three workshops&#13;
over a period of four to six months. Between the workshops, internal community&#13;
discussions take place.&#13;
16.          During the PMD workshops, the community plans are consolidated into&#13;
one Municipal Pan which is: (i) agreeable to the communities; (ii) consistent with financial&#13;
realities, and (iii) suitable for funding from the various financial sources. To consolidate&#13;
the community plans, municipalities would apply sub-project eligibility and ranking&#13;
criteria. These criteria closely reflect those of the relevant funding agencies, as well as&#13;
Government goals. The criteria give greatest weight to sub-projects addressing&#13;
fundamental development bottlenecks and corresponding to the technical capabilities and&#13;
absorptive capacity of the beneficiary community.&#13;
17.          On the basis of the above process, the municipality drafts a PMD, which is&#13;
presented, discussed and negotiated with the various communities. With more detailed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
cost estimates available, the sub-project portfolio is further adjusted to be consistent with&#13;
the available resources. The Plan is reviewed by CORDES to ensure compatibility with&#13;
Departmental and natioral policies and plans. The consultative process is completed with&#13;
the final plan.&#13;
Stage Four: Follow-up to the Municipal Development Plan&#13;
18.          To sustain the PPP process, the EE would continue to provide support to&#13;
the municipality in the implementation of the PMD. The implementation of the PMD,&#13;
which usually covers a period of five years, is guided by the formulation of the Annual&#13;
Operative Plan (Plan Operativo Anual, PAO).. Besides a detailed description of the&#13;
activities to be implemented in a given year, the PAO includes a detailed annual budget,&#13;
which on its turn clears the way for a municipality to receive Co-participation Funds from&#13;
the central government. In the process of formulating PAOs, the EE would assist the&#13;
municipalities to ensure budgetary items reflect the wishes of the communities. In addition&#13;
to the formulation of PAOs, the EE would also help the municipality make adjustments to&#13;
the PMD to take into account changing econormic and social conditions. It is envisaged&#13;
that after the 1995 municipal elections, there would be a considerable need to adjust&#13;
PMDs in those municipalities where PMDs were completed in 1994. Follow-up to the&#13;
PMD may also mean that EEs: (i) help the municipalities with the monitoring of key&#13;
progress indicators mentioned in the plan; (ii) identify training possibilities for community&#13;
and municipality members; and (iii) advise municipalities in management and&#13;
administrative matters of procurement.&#13;
Stage Five: Sub-Project Preparation&#13;
19.          The sub-project preparation consists of three components: (i) sub-project&#13;
profile is a description of the sub-project idea, its rationale and a first approximation of its&#13;
cost; (ii) feasibility study is an economic and financial evaluation of the sub-project's&#13;
viability--an additional technical assessment is necessary only for technically complex sub-&#13;
projects, such as irrigation systems; and (iii) sub-project detailed design is a detailed&#13;
description of the sub-project and its costs in a format suitable for presentation to funding&#13;
agencies.&#13;
20.          The preparation of sub-project profiles begins in parallel with the&#13;
preparation of the PMD, as the ranking process requires an approximation of the costs and&#13;
feasibility of various sub-project options. The final PMD contains a profile for every&#13;
proposed sub-project.&#13;
21.          Sub-project preparation is to be financed by the community itself, the&#13;
municipality, or the funding agencies. SNDR and funding agencies would contract EEs to&#13;
carry out sub-project preparation at various stages. The EE assures the quality of the sub-&#13;
project preparation and the interested community or municipality presents the sub-project&#13;
design to various funding sources.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Rural Communities&#13;
Rural Community Social Structure&#13;
1.           The present Andean rural community structure is based upon the pre-&#13;
Hispanic ayllu. During the colonial period, most ayllus where incorporated into the&#13;
Spanish large properties (hacienda). In 1953, with the Agrarian Reform, sindicatos, local&#13;
rural governments, were formed to transfer land from haciendas back to campesinos.&#13;
2.           Today, the sindicato is found throughout the Andean region, co-existing&#13;
with and complementing the ayllu. Sindicatos are part of a national network"3, a hierarchy&#13;
which up to the provincial level, facilitates certain activities among comnmnunities.&#13;
However, beyond the provincial level, the network serves national political interests and is&#13;
vaguely related to the individual rural sindicatos.&#13;
3.           Both sindicatos and ayllus require their members to be married and possess&#13;
land. The head of the sindicato, the secretary general, is equivalent to the jilacata, the&#13;
ayllu chief In many communities, the same individual holds both positions, acting as the&#13;
jilacata, in ceremonial and traditional events, and, as the secretary general, in&#13;
administrative and managerial affairs. The secretary general, along the with sindicato&#13;
officers, are elected by the community for a one-year term. The appointment of the&#13;
jilacata is based on a revolving principle used to encourage community participation.&#13;
4.           Participation in the asamblea is one of the most important obligations of&#13;
community members. At the asamblea, all significant decisions are taken through a&#13;
tedious and time-consuming consensus process. In addition, members must elect&#13;
community leaders, hold community office, assist in the execution of public works, and&#13;
pay fees. In return, they have access to communal resources (land, water, construction&#13;
facilities, etc.) and receive assistance from the community elders.&#13;
5.           Andean communities have developed particular forms of cooperation&#13;
between families and within the community. Families cooperate in major agricultural&#13;
activities (sowing, harvesting and construction) through a system of reciprocity, whereby&#13;
the support given by one family to another is recorded, and subsequently compensated by&#13;
the recipient with even greater assistance. Between two families, there are ritual kinships,&#13;
13 Sindicatos of the same area form a sub-central, with several sub-centrales constituting a&#13;
central. Centrales of a province formn a central provincial and these are grouped by&#13;
Department to form the federaci6n. Finally, the federaciones make up a national co-&#13;
federacion, which is a member of the national organization of labor unions (Co-federaci6n&#13;
de Obreros Bolivianos, COB).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
which are permanent systems of mutual obligations of cooperation and assistance.&#13;
Assistance is provided in cash, kind and emotional and moral support. This system&#13;
expands the network of natural kinship, providing additional sources of social security in&#13;
moments of need and emergency. Within the community, members must participate in the&#13;
construction, repair and mnaintenance of communal infrastructure, such as irrigation,&#13;
schools and health posts.&#13;
6.           Within the rural community, members are distinguished by their wealth,&#13;
prestige and gender. Richer families, those possessing more land or involved in transport&#13;
services or commerce, exert their influence through ritual kinship and money lending and&#13;
control community and municipal decision-making. Men take nearly all communal&#13;
decisions. Women rarely hold managerial positions or actively participate in the&#13;
asamblea. Rural people regard the urban society with mistrust and resentment,&#13;
considering the urban people to be lacking in cultural and dignity.&#13;
7.           Andean reality is interpreted through myths dividing the world into three&#13;
interrelated spheres: the "above", the "below" and the world men inhabit. The invisible&#13;
beings of the "above" and "below" determine the course of events, govern the fate of men&#13;
and give significance to their existence. In the "above" live the Christian god and the&#13;
saints, as well as the sun, the moon, and the stars. The "below" is the realm of devils,&#13;
demons, the dead and ancestors. The dead and the ancestors are the guardians of the&#13;
fields, families and communities, possessed with powers over the weather. Outstanding&#13;
among these is the "Pachemama", associated with agricultural fertility.&#13;
8.           Ritual practice is an ubiquitous phenomenon in rural Andean life, providing&#13;
a religiously anchored grid for generating social integration and maintaining social order.&#13;
These practices are present as ceremonies, celebrations and festivities performed through-&#13;
out the year. Agricultural rituals are designed to ensure successful harvests. Rituals are&#13;
part of medical therapies, intended to compensate for previous failures responsible for the&#13;
illness.&#13;
Rural Communities and the Participatory Planning Process&#13;
9.           Government's strategy to promote broad participation of the rural&#13;
population in local development planning would empower people at the local level to&#13;
influence and better control their physical, social and political environment. Involvement in&#13;
local planning and decision-making would integrate the hitherto largely segregated rural&#13;
population into the national state by facilitating their identification with national&#13;
institutions and the application of national legal and administrative regulations. To avoid&#13;
that these new powers erode the rural society's mythological foundation, reduce the&#13;
importance of ritual practice and weaken social integration, a number of safeguards have&#13;
been build into the Participatory Planning Process and the activities financed under the&#13;
project. Based against the background that social integration of rural communities is also&#13;
subject to change without the framework of the Participatory Planning Process, these&#13;
safeguards and activities are as follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
10.          The building stone of the Participatory Planning Process is effective&#13;
participation of the OTBs. As already indicated in Annex 1, OTBs are not newly&#13;
established organizations, but merely existing, traditional organizations, which have&#13;
received legal status under the Ley de Participaci6n Popular to legally represent&#13;
communities in the PPP. The latter ensures that existing local power structures, which&#13;
often are the guardians of rural society's social integration, are not by-passed and in effect&#13;
control the participation of rural communities in the PPP. It is within this context that the&#13;
project finances the legal formation and registration of OTBs under its Rural Investment&#13;
Identification and Formulation Program.&#13;
11.          In addition, the LPP explicitly recognizes traditional forms of organization&#13;
and representation (Art. 3, LPP). In this context, the Regulation of the LPP (Art. 26-29)&#13;
allows the formation of indigenous municipal districts within municipalities or a&#13;
conjunction of indigenous municipal districts among various municipalities. These&#13;
districts have the following characteristics: (i) their jurisdiction is related to ethnic&#13;
population and their social organization; (ii) election and representation are based on&#13;
traditional ways and means; and (iii) the maximum traditional authority assumes the&#13;
functions of deputy-mayor (sub-alcalde). Following strong demands from indigenous&#13;
communities, the project would support municipalities in the creation of indigenous&#13;
municipal districts, which would include the organization of a consultation process,&#13;
resulting in the definition of such districts from a functional perspective'4. Terms and&#13;
conditions under which such districts are formed are presently the sole responsibility of the&#13;
municipalities. To provide guidance in this area through the provision of basic norms and&#13;
procedures, a legal definition of the relation between municipalities and indigenous&#13;
municipal districts is also urgently required. For this purpose draft legislation would be&#13;
developed under the project. To allow for the effective participation of indigenous matrix&#13;
organizations in this process, the project would also support efforts aimed at strengthening&#13;
these organizations.&#13;
12.          The formulation of PMDs and the preparation and execution of Annual&#13;
Operative Plans would be closely monitored and adjusted where necessary by SNDR in&#13;
collaboration with SNEGG (Secretaria Nacional de Asuntos Etnicos, de Genero y&#13;
Generacionales). Effective participation of OTBs in the formulation and execution of&#13;
these plans would be an important monitoring indicator upon which subsequent&#13;
adjustments would be based.&#13;
13.          Terms of Reference of all personnel and local consultants financed under&#13;
the project would explicitly stipulate that candidates should command the most common&#13;
indigenous language spoken in their area of operation.&#13;
14 Actual deliniation of these districts could be covered by the National Land Institute through&#13;
the National Land Administration Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
14.         Training of and technical assistance to EEs involved in sub-project&#13;
preparation would focus on those organizations which could demonstrate concrete&#13;
experience of working with indigenous organizations.&#13;
15.         Since the area of operation of regional indigenous organizations does not&#13;
necessarily coincide with municipal boundaries, sub-project proposals, focusing on the&#13;
strengthening of these organizations or activities with a regional impact, which directly&#13;
originate from these organizations would also be eligible for financing from resources&#13;
provided by the project to the Fondo de Desarrollo Campesino. The Secretaria Nacional&#13;
de Desarrollo Rural would play an active role in identifying and putting together such&#13;
proposals by the organizations concerned.&#13;
16.         The proposed training of human resources at the community level would&#13;
particularly focus on strengthening local capacity in managing the participatory planning&#13;
process and improve local capacity in the preparation of community investment projects.&#13;
The latter would eventually empower grassroots organizations to effectively take the&#13;
planning of community development efforts in their own hands under terms and conditions&#13;
decided upon by themselves.&#13;
17.         It is estimated that over 90 percent of the project's potential beneficiaries&#13;
are of indigenous origin, the vast majority being either Quecha or Aymara. However, a&#13;
more careful analysis of the ethnic background of the project's potential beneficiaries&#13;
learns that the project area includes a total of 18 different indigenous groups (see&#13;
Appendix 2 for details). These groups are being represented by a variety of indigenous&#13;
organizations, most of them actively participating in the project through their legal status&#13;
as OTB.&#13;

BOLIVIA&#13;
RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Project Implementing Agencies&#13;
A. National Secretariat for Rural Development&#13;
1.          SNDR, the project's main implementing agency, was created following a&#13;
major restructuring of the Executive power, after the present Bolivian Government came&#13;
into power in August 1993. A Presidential Decree'5 issued in October 1993 established&#13;
SNDR within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Human Development (Ministerio de&#13;
Desarrollo Humano), thereby effectively transforming and transferring the National&#13;
Directorate for Community Development (Direcci6n Nacional de Desarrollo de las&#13;
Coniunidades) from the Ministry of Agriculture and Peasant Affairs (Ministerio de&#13;
Agriculturay Asuntos Campesinos). SNDR was established after the approval of the&#13;
Popular Participation Law (LPP) on May 31, 1994. Prior to this date it was called&#13;
National Secretariat for Rural and Provincial Development.&#13;
2.           Status within Government. SNDR is one of the nine National&#13;
Secretariats within the MDH. The other Secretariats are: (i) Education; (ii) Health;&#13;
(iii) Urban Affairs; (iv) Ethnic Affairs and Gender Issues; (v) Sport; (vi) Culture; and&#13;
(vii) Social Investments. With the approval of the LPP in April 1994, municipalities have&#13;
become the central players of the Executive Power in the rural areas, and the mandate of&#13;
SNDR has changed accordingly. The Presidential Decree of May 1994 defines SNDR's&#13;
mission as: "to promote integrated development of rural areas with the participation of&#13;
grassroots organizations (OTBs)". More specifically the current functions of SNDR are:&#13;
(i) propose, plan, administer, execute, supervise, and evaluate the rural development&#13;
policies of Government; (ii) promote the development of technologies which have the&#13;
potential to increase production and productivity of the rural economy and facilitate the&#13;
preparation and implementation of infrastructure projects in direct support of agricultural&#13;
production; (iii) facilitate and support corresponding institutions in the implementation of&#13;
social programs and basic infrastructure; (iv) maintain relations with grassroots&#13;
organizations to facilitate the implementation of development programs; (v) strengthen&#13;
and empower rural communities and grassroots organizations; and (vi) promote the&#13;
participation of grassroots organizations in the development process.&#13;
3.          Internal Organization. SNDR is headed by a National Secretary&#13;
(Secretaria Nacional), who directly reports to the Minister of MDH. SNDR consists of&#13;
two Sub-Secretariats (Sub-Secretarias): Productive Promotion (Promoci6n Productiva)&#13;
and Social Promotion (Promoci6n Social). Legal and Financial and Administrative Affairs&#13;

are handled by the Department of General Coordination (Coordinaci6n General). The&#13;
National Secretary is further supported by the Offices of Public Relations, Planning and&#13;
Monitoring, and Internal Audit. Apart from the central office, SNDR has nine&#13;
Departmental offices, which typically consist of one coordinator, 6 professional and 4&#13;
support staff Total staff of SNDR as per November 1994 was 186, of which 97 were&#13;
posted in the Departmental offices. Figure 1 below presents SNDR's organizational chart.&#13;

4.             SNDR's Operations. SNDR can be described as a young organization&#13;
which, in the process of defining its role and establishing itself, has done a remarkable job&#13;
in establishing itself as the intellectual leader and the front-runner organization in the&#13;
implementation of the Popular Participation Law and the Participatory Planning Process&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
(PPP). It designed the PPP methodology which has now been adopted as a model to&#13;
formulate municipal development plans. Effective formulation of such plans, based on a&#13;
genuine participatory process, is regarded as key to the successful implementation of the&#13;
Popular Participation Law. SNDR has been assigned to extend this model nationwide by&#13;
giving it a leading role in training all parties involved in the PPP. Based on the developed&#13;
PPP methodology, SNDR coordinated and facilitated the formulation of municipal&#13;
development plans in 94 municipalities. Nine months after the approval of the Popular&#13;
Participation Law, in December 1994, SNDR was able to present these plans to the&#13;
President of the Republic. Since early 1994 the operations of SNDR have been supported&#13;
by technical assistance financed under a pilot project as part of the preparation of the&#13;
Rural Communities Development Project.&#13;
5.          Relationship with Other Organizations. Most closely related to&#13;
SNDR's functions and operations are: (i) the Small-Farmers Development Fund (FDC),&#13;
(ii) the National Secretariat for Popular Participation (SNPP); and (iii) the Regional&#13;
Development Corporations (CORDES). SNDR sets the policy and rural development&#13;
framework in which FDC operates. Consequently, municipalities and rural communities&#13;
considered by SNDR as target areas for project intervention are automatically also&#13;
considered by FDC as guiding principles to geographically target its investment programs.&#13;
With the privatization of a large number of activities originally carried out by the&#13;
CORDES, these organizations are increasingly being involved in the implementation of the&#13;
Popular Participation Law. In order to better define the division of responsibilities&#13;
between SNDR and the CORDES, it has been agreed in a draft convenio that SNDR&#13;
would take a leading role in the implementation of the Popular Participation Law in&#13;
98 municipalities, selected as the target area of project intervention. CORDES would&#13;
have primary responsibility concerning this subject in the remaining municipalities.&#13;
6.          SNDR Strengthening. After the initial efforts to build up institutional&#13;
capacity in SNDR to develop and manage the PPP process, the next step is to enable&#13;
SNDR to follow-up on the implementation of municipal development plans (MDP).&#13;
Consequently, strengthening of SNDR, which in the pilot project primarily has taken place&#13;
at the central level to ensure intellectual leadership in the development of methodologies,&#13;
will increasingly shift to the Departmental offices to facilitate the implementation of&#13;
MDPs. Under the proposed Project technical assistance at the central level would be&#13;
reduced and focus mainly on training of a range of subjects related to the PPP in order to&#13;
achieve coverage at the national level. Technical assistance to the Departmental offices&#13;
would increase threefold as compared to the situation under the pilot project.&#13;
B.    National Secretariat for Popular Participation&#13;
7.          SNPP was created shortly after the approval of the LPP in April 1994. In&#13;
general terms, SNPP is responsible for LPP's implementation and institutionalization.&#13;
More specifically, SNPP: (i) establishes mechanisms to more closely relate the&#13;
administration of municipalities to the principles of popular participation; (ii) elaborates&#13;
programs for municipal strengthening in the areas of planning, budgeting, accounting, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
project preparation and management; and (iii) controls and monitors the use of co-&#13;
participation funds made available under the LPP. Given this mandate, SNPP is an&#13;
obvious candidate to coordinate the implementation of the proposed project activities in&#13;
the area of municipal strengthening, as presented in more detail in Annex 4.&#13;
8.             SNPP is one of the three National Secretariats in the Ministry of&#13;
Sustainable Development and Environment (Ministerio de Desarrollo SostenibleyMedio&#13;
Ambiente, MDSMA) besides the ones for Planning and Natural Resources and&#13;
Environment. SNPP consists of two Sub-Secretariats, which are responsible for OTBs&#13;
and municipal strengthening respectively (see Figure 2 for details).&#13;

9.             To implement the project's activities aimed at strengthening the target 98&#13;
municipalities in administrative and financial management, SNPP would enter into service&#13;
contracts with selected EEs. To ensure consistency and compatibility of administrative&#13;
and financial management systems across municipalities, SNPP would train selected EEs&#13;
in the methodology and approach developed for this purpose. In addition, SNPP would&#13;
follow-up and monitor the implementation of the municipal strengthening program. For&#13;
this purpose, the project would finance four consultants in SNPP for a period of two&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C.    Small-Farmer Development Fund&#13;
10.          The Small-Farmer Development Fund (FDC) was created by presidential&#13;
decree on March 23, 1989 as a response to farmers' demands for Government support to&#13;
their activities, in view of the closure of the State-run Agrarian Bank. It was set up as a&#13;
non-profit, independent financing agency to support small, non commercial agricultural&#13;
and productive rural activities. The head of FDC was given ministerial status and reported&#13;
to the President. FDC's capital base was to come from Treasury contributions, and from&#13;
grants, loans and other non-reimbursable contributions by foreign governments and&#13;
multilateral organizations. FDC's mandate was not only to provide grants16 (PIDC), but&#13;
was also to extend credit directly to small farmer groups. This caused serious credit-&#13;
recovery problems at FDC, which contributed to subsequent Presidential Decrees&#13;
regulating its activities.&#13;
11.         Internal Organization. FDC's organizational structure is based on a&#13;
technical advisory division at headquarters and regional program officers in each of the&#13;
nine Departments in the country. The total number of staff is 65. The Executive&#13;
President reports to the Minister of the Presidency. The General Manager is FDC's chief&#13;
operating officer. FDC's operative body is divided in four Directorates: Infra-structure&#13;
and Services, Credit, Administration and Finance; and Planning, Follow-up and&#13;
Evaluation. The PIDC is located under the Infrastructure and Services Directorate.&#13;
12.         FDC suffers from a lack of qualified personnel particularly at the&#13;
Departmental levels. Consequently, decisions are made only at headquarters. This&#13;
centralized decision meeting coupled with complex legal procedures, has negatively&#13;
affected FDC's ability to respond adequately to its clients. FDC has now recently&#13;
established criteria to decentralize approval and administrative authority to the regional&#13;
offices (see Appendix l). Consequently, the project would contribute to multilateral&#13;
efforts to strengthen FDC by financing the acquisition of nine vehicles (one per regional&#13;
office) and the hiring of 20 consultants. IDA would finance, during three years, a civil&#13;
engineer and administrator for each of the nine Departments and one agronomist and a&#13;
lawyer at the central office. The terms of reference of the consultants have been agreed&#13;
upon during appraisal and would be included in the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
13.          Functions and Operations. FDC's funds are channeled through its credit&#13;
and PIDC arms. The PIDC program is designed to provide prompt response to simple&#13;
constraints in the rural productive process. Accordingly, rather than funding complex and&#13;
costly projects, it seeks to finance large numbers of small-scale projects with high&#13;
beneficiary participation.&#13;

Small Farmer Development).&#13;

14.            Sources of Funds. Between March 23, 1989 and December, 1993, FDC&#13;
raised a total US$33.7 million from bilateral donors and the Inter-American Development&#13;
Bank (US$12.5 million) for the financing of the PIDC.&#13;

15.            Project Financing. Up to the end of 1994, FDC disbursements amounted&#13;
to US$12.8 million of which US$5.4 million were for credit operations and US$7.4&#13;
million for PIDC. FDC has had disbursement problems in 1994. There were&#13;
administrative problems to access BID and KfW funds, the Board of Directors had been&#13;
disbanded so that no new grants (above US$80,000) could be approved, and the transfer&#13;
of functions from the CORDES (which carried out 60 percent of the FDC projects) to the&#13;
municipalities through the Popular Participation Law created implementation problems.&#13;

16.            Financial Performance. FDC's balance sheet does not include resources&#13;
that are received by FDC for the PIDC, which are kept in contingency accounts. FDC has&#13;
requested the Banking Superintendency to determine a better way to classify the bulk of&#13;
its financial sources within the balance sheet. Administrative expenses, on the other hand,&#13;
include those for the PIDC. Consequently the reported results reflect only part of FDC's&#13;
main line of activity, namely grants. The 1992 and 1993 results show a big increase in&#13;
administrative expenses - mainly salary increases- and an extraordinary increment in&#13;
uncollectible accounts.&#13;

FDC Reform Process and Institutional Arrangements&#13;
17.           During the period of September 1990-April 4, 1993, a number of&#13;
fraudulent activities involving misuse of funds, forging of operations, and other illegal acts&#13;
allegedly took place at FDC. Since the new management team was put in place in 1993,&#13;
reform efforts have been successful in improving internal control and auditing procedures,&#13;
as well as in streamlining operations. FDC management has also made an effort to&#13;
improve performance at all levels. It is expected that Board restructuring and the&#13;
proposed management decentralization plan enhance FDC responsiveness to client needs.&#13;
FDC Institutional Strengthening&#13;
18.           Under the project FDC would complete a comprehensive overhaul of its&#13;
procedures. New procedures would permit regional approval of small sub-projects (below&#13;
a maximum ceiling) and simplify legal, administrative, and disbursement procedures.&#13;
During appraisal, agreement has been reached on FDC's decentralization plan and how its&#13;
implementation would be monitored. The plan is included in the Project Implementation&#13;
Manual and attached to this Annex in Appendix 1. The Mid-Term Review would evaluate&#13;
the implementation of the decentralized procedures. To accompany the above reforms,&#13;
the project would strengthen FDC's Departmental offices by financing one local&#13;
professional in civil engineering or agronomy and one administrative consultant for each&#13;
Department during three years. In addition, the project would finance an agronomist and&#13;
one legal consultant in FDC central office. This would also enable FDC to gradually&#13;
decentralize its management system by delegating authority to the Departmental offices to&#13;
evaluate, approve, finance, and supervise small sub-projects. Detailed terms of reference&#13;
for the consultants financed under the project have been agreed upon during appraisal and&#13;
are to be included in the Project Implementation Manual. Moreover, the project would&#13;
provide vehicles and equipment to FDC's Departmental offices.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
BOLWIA&#13;
RURAL COMMUNITMES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Executing Agencies&#13;
Need for Expertise&#13;
1.           This Annex identifies: (i) the project's technical and managerial expertise&#13;
requirements; (ii) potential technical sources; (iii) major issues concerning such expertise;&#13;
and (iv) project responses to these issues.&#13;
2.           Each sub-project phase requires specific technical expertise of the various&#13;
local organizations. Table 1 juxtaposes the organizational levels--OTB, municipality, EE,&#13;
and sub-contractor--with the technical expertise required for each phase--demand&#13;
identification and formulation, sub-projects preparation, implementation, evaluation and,&#13;
operation. In addition, communities and municipalities require a minimum of managerial&#13;
and administrative skills to contract technical expertise to implement their development&#13;
plans.&#13;

3.           An Executing Agency (EE) can fill technical gaps and provide the needed&#13;
capabilities to the local organizations. A qualified EE has sound managerial and&#13;
administrative skills and a strong linkage with the rural communities. The EE can directly&#13;
provide the required technical knowledge or contract a sub-contractor as a technical&#13;
source.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Available Expertise&#13;
4.           Sources of expertise include NGOs, Church entities, public institutions, and&#13;
private consulting firms.&#13;
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO)17&#13;
5.           The Bolivian NGO movement started in the 60's with the Catholic Church.&#13;
In the 70's, politically-oriented NGOs were created to oppose the military dictatorships.&#13;
The economic crises associated with the structural adjustment policies of the 80's,&#13;
increased the number of NGOs working among the poor urban and rural communities.&#13;
6.           Today, more than 600 NGOs manage annually US$200 nillion in funds&#13;
from bilateral cooperation and the Bolivian Government. The NGO movement in Bolivia&#13;
is a precursor to the participatory strategy, as 24 NGOs already have Participatory&#13;
Planning experience". Two examples of on-going NGO efforts in participatory planning,&#13;
dating back some ten years, are in the provinces of Mizque, with the NGO CEDEAGRO,&#13;
and Zudafiez, with PROAGRO.&#13;
7.           Around 38519 NGOs are organized into three networks: UNITAS (Uni6n&#13;
Nacional de Institucionespara el Trabajo de Acci6n Social), ERBOL (Escuela&#13;
Radiof6nica de Bolivia) and AIPE (Asociaci6n de Instituciones Para Educaci6n). These&#13;
are coordinated by the national Coordinadora de Redes. Among the NGOs, there is a&#13;
sub-group of 80 NGOs referred to as Institutions for Social Development (Ins!ituciones&#13;
para el Desarrollo Social, IPDS). These NGOs have attempted to distinguish themselves&#13;
by imposing upon themselves relatively rigid professional standards, including external&#13;
audits. The IPDS seek sustainable development, instead of charitable activities.&#13;
8.           To manage the NGO movement, Government established a Directorate of&#13;
NGO Coordination (Directorio Central de Organizaciones Non-Gobernamentales,&#13;
DCONG) in the Ministry of Human Development and a NGO registry. The registry&#13;
contains information the activities of nearly 300 national and 75 foreign registered NGOs.&#13;
9.           There are 146 registered NGOs in the target area of project intervention.&#13;
Among these, 93 work in rural development, more than a third in agricultural production,&#13;
another third in marketing, and 93 percent provide training and extension.&#13;
17 An NGO is a private non-profit organization, national or foreign, religious or not, which&#13;
implements developments or charity activity with Govemment or foreign cooperation fimds&#13;
in the national territory (Supreme decree 2409. La Paz, 1990).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

10.         The advantages of relying upon NGOs as sources of technical expertise are&#13;
based upon their: (i) focus on the very poor; (ii) proximity to the communities;&#13;
(iii) capacity to reach the rural poor in remote areas; (iv) capacity to promote local&#13;
participation; and (v) capacity to operate at low cost. For these reasons and because of&#13;
the ineffectiveness of many public agencies in rural areas, NGOs have become crucial in&#13;
the country's rural development programs.&#13;
11.         The main weaknesses associated with NGOs as sources of technical&#13;
expertise are their: (i) limited technical capacity; (ii) lack of broad programming;&#13;
(iii) limited sustainability of the organization and their projects; and (iv) narrow&#13;
geographic scope. While some NGOs are efficient organizations with extensive&#13;
knowledge of rural Bolivia, others are extremely weak both in terms of management and&#13;
technical skills. The need to distinguish the efficient from the weaker NGOs complicates&#13;
Government collaboration with them.&#13;
Churches&#13;
12.         Although they are not always officially registered as NGOs, various&#13;
churches and their institutions--principally the Catholic Church--are active in Bolivia. The&#13;
most active and prominent organizations are: CARITAS and "Social Works for Rural&#13;
Roads" (Obras Sociales de Caminos de Acceso Rural) which cover the whole country.&#13;
Religious organizations tend to focus on charitable social assistance programs, promoting&#13;
handicraft, health, extension, formal and informal education projects. Most projects are&#13;
financed by funds from the Church and Governments of the industrial countries.&#13;
Public Institutions&#13;
13.         The following is a brief description of four major public institutional&#13;
sources of technical expertise.&#13;
14.         Departmental Development Corporations (CORDES). The&#13;
Development Corporation (CORDES), public Departmental development institutions,&#13;
were originally part of the national Bolivian Development Corporation (Corporaci6n&#13;
Boliviana de Fomento - CBF), an immense institution, managing numerous public-owned&#13;
industries. In the '70s, CBF was broken into nine Departmental corporations, each&#13;
responsible for productive investments as well as basic infrastructure. CORDES play an&#13;
important role rural development. In 1994, CORDES were executing 80 FDC-funded&#13;
sub-projects, representing more than half of the total 1994 FDC portfolio.&#13;
15.         As a result of the privatization of public investments throughout Bolivia,&#13;
CORDES' role in implementation and their involvement in regional and sub-regional&#13;
planning and supporting municipalities would increase. Decreto Supremo No 23845&#13;
(August 18, 1994) divides the responsibilities of the CORDES into four major areas:&#13;
(i) general; (ii) planning; (iii) Departmental investments; and (iv) strengthening of&#13;
municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
16.          General responsibilities of the CORDES include to: (i) formulate&#13;
Departmental development plans which integrate and articulate development plans defined&#13;
at the municipal, regional, and national level; (ii) present Departmental development plans&#13;
to MDSMA in conjunction with recommendations concerning required policy changes&#13;
which are necessary to facilitate their implementation; and (iii) ensure that the&#13;
Departmental allocation of resources is in line with PMDs.&#13;
17.          CORDES's concrete responsibilities in the area of planning, relevant to the&#13;
project are to: (i) establish, manage, and maintain databases containing information on&#13;
characteristics, use, potential and limitations of natural resources in the Departments;&#13;
(ii) support the efforts of municipalities to establish their own capacity to manage the PPP,&#13;
formulate local investment projects; and define PAOs; (iii) establish mechanisms to&#13;
facilitate and integrate the financing of projects; (iv) make a program of Departmental&#13;
investments and a projection of required resources to finance these investments; (v) enter&#13;
into contracts with third parties to prepare and implement projects which have an impact&#13;
beyond municipal boundaries; (vi) on request of municipalities, enter into contracts with&#13;
third parties to prepare and execute projects which exceed the technical and/or financial&#13;
management capacity of municipalities; (vii) participate in the preparation, actualization,&#13;
and implementation of the national territorial regulatory plan (Plait Nacional de&#13;
Ordenamiento Territorial) and present Departmental land use plans to MDSMA; and&#13;
(viii) promote and ensure that municipal governments and other public and private entities&#13;
conduct environmental impact assessments as part of ex-ante evaluations of investment&#13;
projects.&#13;
18.          With respect to the responsibilities of CORDES regarding Departmental&#13;
investments, the decree indicates two issues which have relevance for the project. lFirst,&#13;
CORDES have a leading role in defining investment priorities based on the Departmental&#13;
development plan. Second, CORDES, as the representing bodies of the Executive Power,&#13;
would monitor the implementation of investment projects by municipal governments.&#13;
19.         In the area of municipal strengthening, CORDES would: (i) provide&#13;
support in the formulation of PAOs and the preparation of annual budgets; (ii) assist the&#13;
municipalities in the utilization of Co-participation Funds in such a way that municipal&#13;
administrative costs do not exceed ten percent of the resources made available under this&#13;
arrangement; (iii) assist in the maintenance of infrastructure, particularly secondary roads&#13;
and micro-irrigation systems; (iv) assist in the formation of inter-community collaboration&#13;
arrangements, particularly in municipalities having less than 5,000 inhabitants; (v) assist&#13;
municipalities in the establishment of their own capacity to manage the PPP and to&#13;
promote the sustainable use of natural resources; (vi) provide technical assistance to&#13;
municipalities in contracting basic services; and (vii) assist municipalities in identifying,&#13;
formulating and administrating projects.&#13;
20.          Bolivian Institute of Agricultural Technology (IBTA) is an agricultural&#13;
research and pre-extension institute under the Secretariat of Agriculture. It has five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
research stations in the Highland Plateau and Valleys and employs about 120 scientists and&#13;
technical specialists researching: (i) cereals (42 technical specialists); (ii) pulses&#13;
(11 specialists); (iii) tubercles (51 specialists), (iv) livestock (15 specialists); and&#13;
(v) special projects (cultivation systems and small ruminants). With the support of the&#13;
IDA financed Agriculture Technology Development Project, IBTA is overcoming a long&#13;
and difficult period of inefficiency. With its functions clarified, it is anticipated that IBTA&#13;
would play a central role in agricultural technology generation.&#13;
21.          Tropical Agricultural Research Center (CIAT) is a Santa Cruz-based&#13;
agricultural research institution, under the Secretariat of Agriculture, which specializes in&#13;
tropical agriculture. Its annual budget in recent years was US$3 million.&#13;
22.          National Road Service (SNC), under the Transport Ministry, is&#13;
responsible for construction and maintenance of major roads (troncales). Presently SNC&#13;
carries out maintenance and sub-contracts road construction to international companies.&#13;
About a fifth of SNC's budget is financed by user tolls, the remainder is from the National&#13;
Treasury. Of the 4,500 employees, about 10 percent are technical personnel.&#13;
23.          Prefectures are the central Government's Departmental representatives in&#13;
charge of construction of rural social infrastructure, including government buildings,&#13;
squares and water and sanitation infrastructures. Their financial sources are: the National&#13;
Treasury, Social Investment Fund (FIS), FDC and the Regional Development Fund&#13;
(FDR). Their human resources are 1,558 technical staff and 3,571 non-professional&#13;
workers.&#13;
Private Consulting Firms&#13;
24.          There are 49 consulting firms associated with ANEC, the association of&#13;
private consulting firms (Asociaci6n Nacional Empresas Consultoras, ANEC). To&#13;
participate in public bidding, a private firm needs to be an ANEC-member. Among its&#13;
members, ANEC counts 495 technical experts and 286 administrative personnel. Of the&#13;
member firms, 17 are involved with agricultural development. While technically&#13;
competent, these firms are oriented toward the design and implementation of relatively&#13;
large-scale projects, having little contact with small farmers in remote rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
Issues&#13;
25.          The discussion on the adequacy of technical and managerial expertise in&#13;
Bolivia for the execution of the project raises a number of issues:&#13;
(a)     Information on National Supply of Technical Expertise. There would be&#13;
strong demand for technical and managerial expertise, especially from the&#13;
weaker rural municipalities. However, information on national technical&#13;
expertise sources is insufficient to assess the adequacy of supply to satisfy the&#13;
demand that would be generated by PPP.&#13;
(b)     Expertise in Participatory Planning Process. Only 24 NGOs (less than ten&#13;
percent of all NGOs) have experience in this methodology.&#13;
(c)     Managerial Expertise. Most municipalities lack the required managerial and&#13;
administrative skills and knowledge to perform the responsibilities as laid out in&#13;
the LPP.&#13;
(d)     Funding Agencies' Policies. Many EEs do not know the policies or&#13;
procedures for sub-project proposal presentation to the funding agencies. As a&#13;
result, funding agencies frequently receive sub-project proposals which are&#13;
unacceptable because they are: (i) beyond the institutional terms of reference;&#13;
(ii) poorly presented; or (iii) lack required information. Faulty proposal&#13;
presentation delays the appraisal process and limits sub-project approval. Lack&#13;
of knowledge of funding agencies' policies is regarded as a greater limitation&#13;
to project approval than is lack of expertise in sub-project design.&#13;
(e)     Expertise in Rural Areas. In certain rural areas, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca&#13;
and La Paz, there is a myriad of technically sound institutions with strong&#13;
relationships with the rural communities. In others, especially Pando and the&#13;
Beni, coverage is extremely weak. Private consulting firms in Bolivia are&#13;
technically competent in design of agricultural and infrastructure projects.&#13;
However, the reluctance of many qualified technicians to work in the remote&#13;
rural areas limits the possibilities of financing rural investments.&#13;
Project's Response&#13;
26.          The project would mitigate the above problems by: (i) better organizing&#13;
and classifying available information regarding technical supply to better identify local&#13;
needs and improve the efficiency of existing expertise; (ii) providing training at various&#13;
levels to address the most widespread deficiencies in technical or managerial expertise; and&#13;
(iii) financing EEs and project preparation activities in remote areas. The project would&#13;
address each issue as described below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
(a)   Organization and Dissemination of Available Information. SNDR is&#13;
assessing the national supply of technical expertise. The results of this&#13;
institutional diagnostic are to be available by the end of 1994. To increase the&#13;
efficiency of existing institutions, SNDR would organize a committee to share&#13;
and coordinate information on rural development and appropriate technologies&#13;
among public and private institutions.&#13;
(b)   Participatory Planning Process Techniques. The experience developed by&#13;
SNDR and some NGOs would be used to train EEs, municipalities and OTBs.&#13;
This training would focus on learning-by-doing techniques, including inviting&#13;
trainees to participate in actual PPP sessions (Annex 7).&#13;
(c)   Managerial Expertise. Municipalities, OTBs and EEs have limited&#13;
administrative and financial management expertise. The project, through&#13;
SNPP and specialized training firms, would finance training for local&#13;
organizations in administration, accounting and financial and personnel&#13;
management (Annexes 5 and 6).&#13;
(d)   Funding Agency's Policies. The project would finance training to develop&#13;
sub-project design skills. Sub-project ideas need to be developed into a&#13;
technical design which can be easily appraised by the funding agencies. EEs&#13;
would either design the project directly or would sub-contract the design to&#13;
specialized institutions having the required technical knowledge. The project&#13;
would train EEs to prepare or supervise the preparation of the technical design&#13;
of sub-projects in conformity with financial source norms (Annex 7).&#13;
(e)   Expertise in Rural Areas. To encourage EE establishment in remote areas,&#13;
the project would contract EEs in specific rural areas for PPP support and sub-&#13;
project preparation. In addition, the funding agencies would need to consider&#13;
and compensate the private firms the additional costs inherent in working for&#13;
prolonged periods of time in remote rural areas.&#13;

ANNEX 5&#13;
BOLIIA&#13;
RURAL COMMUNITES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Gender Perspective&#13;
Existing Situation&#13;
1.          While the role of rural women varies with their cultural origin and their&#13;
degree of urbanization,20 some generalizations can be made concerning their position in&#13;
the rural society. Women are solely responsible for domestic affairs, including family&#13;
nutrition, education and health. They provide child care, cultivate, process and prepare&#13;
basic foods, care for small animals and market farm produce. Agricultural and manual&#13;
labor is divided equally between the husband and wife. In addition, women make crafts&#13;
and textiles providing a significant source of household income.&#13;
2.          According to the 1992 Census, nearly one-quarter of rural households are&#13;
headed by women. Households with women as heads are most prevalent in the Highland&#13;
Plateau. In Chuquisaca, Potosi and Oruro, because of the high rate of emigration of men,&#13;
more than one-third of poor rural households are headed by women. In the Tropics,&#13;
women head households are less common, with less than 10 percent of the poor rural&#13;
households headed by women. Female-headed households are among the poorest of the&#13;
rural households as family income of those households is only 54 percent of the average&#13;
income of households with both a male and female income earner.&#13;
3.          Although there still exists a significant gender bias in education levels, over&#13;
the years important progress has been made in reducing differences between men and&#13;
women. The incidence of illiteracy is still higher in rural areas compared to urban areas,&#13;
but in both areas significant progress has been made for both men and women between&#13;
1976 and 1992 (Table 1). This progress appears even more significant as illiteracy&#13;
percentages are specified for different age groups, which indicate that the gap between&#13;
men and women between 15-24 years old has reduced from 15.7 to 4.7 percentage points&#13;
between 1976 and 1992. In general terms the data suggest three major conclusions:&#13;
(i) illiteracy is concentrated in rural areas among women in the older age category;&#13;
(ii) illiteracy percentages of women in 1992 are at similar levels of men in 1976; and&#13;
(iii) reduction of illiteracy percentages is most notable in the younger age categories.&#13;
Reduction seems to have been relatively slow among women in urban areas.&#13;
4.          Despite their dominant role in household affairs, cultural practices,&#13;
exacerbated by the high incidence of illiteracy, have prevented women from actively&#13;
participating in community decision-making. While women are permnitted to attend&#13;

communal assemblies, their presence, with few exceptions, is figurative. In addition,&#13;
unlike men who receive documentation upon military conscription, most women do not&#13;
have proper identification papers, precluding them from, among other things, voting in&#13;
local or national elections.&#13;

Integration of Gender Focus in Project Activities&#13;
5.          The project would be an important vehicle to begin to integrate women&#13;
into Bolivian political and civil affairs by increasing their active participation in the&#13;
implementation of the Popular Participation Law, particularly in the participatory planning&#13;
process and in the implementation of PMDs. Although SNDR aims to integrate a gender&#13;
focus in all project activities, a number of specific activities have been defined under the&#13;
project to ensure such integration at the operational level. These activities include:&#13;
(i) evaluation of the participatory planning process and the PMDs from a gender&#13;
perspective; (ii) support to the participation of women in the registration of OTBs and the&#13;
formation of Comites de Vigilanlcia; (iii) support to the implementation and adjustment of&#13;
PMDs from a gender perspective; and (iv) support to the implementation of a training&#13;
program focusing on gender issues.&#13;
6.          A multi-institutional team consisting of three experts from SNDR's central&#13;
office, three experts from the central office of the Sub-Secretaria Nacional de Asunltos de&#13;
Genero (SAG) and seven experts of its Departmental offices would implement this&#13;
program in 14 pilot municipalities. The results of the program would be integrated in&#13;
SNDR's activities as defined under the project's Rural Investment Identification and&#13;
Formulation component and the Training of Public and Private Organizations component.&#13;
The ultimate aim of incorporating a gender perspective in the project activities is to&#13;
increase the number of sub-projects financed by FDC which particularly focus on women&#13;
in development issues.&#13;
7.           The evaluation of the participatory planning process and the PMDs would&#13;
include: (i) formulation of criteria for gender-based evaluation; (ii) evaluation of&#13;
participatory planning process in 14 pilot municipalities and incorporation of results in&#13;
evaluation methodology to be followed in the remaining 84 municipalities; (iii) evaluation&#13;
of proposed investments in the PMDs to ensure that "women-oriented" projects, such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
improved technology for basic food crop cultivation, agro-processing and textiles, are&#13;
considered in the community's investment program; and (iv) adjustment of participatory&#13;
planning manual based on results of the evaluation.&#13;
8.           Support to the participation of women in the registration of OTBs and the&#13;
formation of Comites de Vigilancia would include: (i) registration of OTBs and formation&#13;
of Comites de Vigilancia in 14 pilot municipalities; (ii) coordination with other&#13;
departments of the registration of OTBs and formation of Comites de Vigilancia, based on&#13;
the lessons learnt in the 14 pilot municipalities; and (iii) adjustment of corresponding&#13;
manuals for registration of OTBs and formation of Comites de Vigilancia to ensure&#13;
participation of women in these processes.&#13;
9.           Support to the implementation and adjustment of PMDs from a gender&#13;
perspective would include: (i) execution of additional diagnosis in 14 pilot municipalities,&#13;
based upon which PMDs would be adjusted and the methodology for adjustment in the&#13;
other 84 municipalities would be defined; (ii) ensure including of gender perspective in&#13;
Terms of Reference of contracts for Executing Agencies; and (iii) support to the&#13;
preparation of sub-project proposals following project eligibility criteria with respect to&#13;
gender of local investment funds.&#13;
10.         Support to the implementation of a training program focusing on gender&#13;
issues would include: (i) training in gender issues of personnel of institutions involved in&#13;
rural development; (ii) preparation and diffusion of didactic material on gender issues in&#13;
rural development; (iii) incorporation of gender issues in the curricula of projects focusing&#13;
on human resources development; (iv) incorporation of a gender perspective in the&#13;
proposed training programs aiming at OTBs; and (v) incorporation of a gender&#13;
perspective in the proposed technical training for project formulation, preparation, and&#13;
management (as described in Annex 7).&#13;
Gender Perspective and Sub-project Eligibility Criteria&#13;
11.         According to existing sub-project eligibility criteria FDC would not finance&#13;
sub-projects with a negative impact on women. In order to determine sub-project's&#13;
potential impact on women, FDC takes into account a number of indicators during sub-&#13;
project identification and preparation, implementation, and ex-post evaluation.&#13;
12.         To indicate women's involvement in sub-project identification and&#13;
preparation, FDC looks to find answers on the following questions21: Did women&#13;
participate in the identification of community needs which the sub-project seeks to&#13;
address? How were women consulted during sub-project preparation? How would the&#13;
project change women's access to and control over productive resources? Have women&#13;
been considered as a special category of sub-project beneficiaries? What disadvantages&#13;

Reembolsable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
and specific problems could the sub-project pose to women? What is the experience of&#13;
the proposed executing agency with respect to the integration of women in the process of&#13;
development? Do the sub-project objectives indicate that men and women would benefit&#13;
equally from the sub-project? Does the sub-project provide equal opportunities to men&#13;
and women to participate? How does the sub-project promote the participation of women&#13;
and how would it improve her social position? Do women have time to participate in&#13;
meetings and seminars associated with the project? How has the existing division of labor&#13;
and responsibilities between men and women been taken into consideration in sub-project&#13;
objectives and methodology?&#13;
13.         In order to determine the involvement of women in sub-project&#13;
implementation FDC seeks to answer the following questions during supervision: Does&#13;
the sub-project implementation strategy takes into account the traditional roles of men and&#13;
women in the activities which would be implemented under the sub-project? Does the&#13;
sub-project implementation strategy takes into account how constraints related to&#13;
available time, language, education, and religion could affect the participation of women?&#13;
Does implementation of the sub-project imply that women have to provide additional labor&#13;
besides their existing tasks? How does sub-project implementation strengthen the position&#13;
of women in the community? How does sub-project implementation change the position&#13;
of women within households? How does sub-project implementation make use of specific&#13;
skills traditionally provided by women? Has the contribution of women in sub-project&#13;
implementation been quantified? Do women benefit from training activities, technical&#13;
assistance and other extension activities related to sub-project implementation? Do sub-&#13;
project monitoring indicators include variables which are gender specific? Are women&#13;
represented in sub-project management/administration? Have women organized&#13;
themselves in order to participate in the sub-project? What are the specific responsibilities&#13;
of men and women in sub-project implementation? How do women participate in the&#13;
decision-making process related to sub-project implementation? Have women been&#13;
trained in sub-project administration and organizational procedures?&#13;
14.         In order to determine the impact of sub-projects on women, FDC seeks to&#13;
answer the following question during ex-post evaluation: What economic and social&#13;
aspects related to the project have benefited women directly? What immediate effects has&#13;
the project on the position of women and their participation in community affairs? How&#13;
have women participated in the different phases of the project cycle (design, management,&#13;
planning, implementation, evaluation)?&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Municipal Strengthening&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          The approval of the LPP drastically changed the concept of the&#13;
municipality as being primarily an urban center. Rural areas, whose administration used to&#13;
be the exclusive responsibility of Departmental Governments assisted by Corporaciones&#13;
Regionales de Desarrollo (CORDES), were added to the jurisdiction of existing&#13;
municipalities or included in new municipalities. On average, a municipality consists of&#13;
40 communities, each legally represented by an OTB. OTBs directly supervise and&#13;
control the implementation of municipal activities at the community level. They indirectly&#13;
monitor and control municipal activities through a Comite de Vigilancia, which supervises&#13;
the municipal budget.&#13;
2.          Besides the creation of a new administrative structure, the LPP provides&#13;
the legal framework for: (i) a major decentralization of political authority; (ii) a more&#13;
equitable allocation of public revenues by the central Government; and (iii) increased local&#13;
authority in local revenue raising. Consequently, ownership of physical infrastructure,&#13;
including hospitals, primary and secondary schools, cultural and sport facilities, secondary&#13;
roads; and micro-irrigation systems has been transferred to municipal Governments.&#13;
Municipal Governments are now financially responsible for the administration and&#13;
maintenance of existing physical infrastructure and supervise their operation. More&#13;
importantly, new investments in these areas have to be financed from the municipal&#13;
budget.&#13;
3.          To allow municipal governments effectively assume their new&#13;
responsibilities, the central Government increased the amount of public revenues allocated&#13;
to municipalities, by making available so-called co-participation funds. These funds are&#13;
allocated on a per capita basis. Actual disbursements only occur when an Annual&#13;
Operative Plan (PAO) exists. Besides co-participation funds, municipalities are entitled to&#13;
raise own revenues from land taxes and urban property taxes would directly benefit the&#13;
municipal budget.&#13;
Justification of Project Activities&#13;
4.          For most municipalities, and almost all of those included in the target area&#13;
of project interventions, the availability of co-participation funds means a considerable&#13;
increase in revenues. Total co-participation funds available for distribution to all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
301 municipalities in 1995 are estimated at US$145 million. Since the 98 municipalities&#13;
included in the project area are relatively small in terms of population, co-participation&#13;
funds available to those municipalities are estimated at approximately US$20 million in&#13;
1995. Given actual disbursements of the two major Bolivian investment funds (FDC and&#13;
FIS) at around US$50 million in 1994, it is clear that resources available to municipalities&#13;
for financing investments are significant, even if administrative expenditures and operation&#13;
and maintenance costs to be paid from the municipal budget are taken into consideration.&#13;
5.           The increase in municipal budgets is even more significant given the lack of&#13;
adequate administrative and financial management capacity in most municipalities.&#13;
Consequently, municipalities have difficulties spending co-participation funds following&#13;
established accounting rules and are unable to effectively raise local revenues. The latter&#13;
is, among others, illustrated by the fact that allocated co-participation funds account for&#13;
over 95 percent of the budgets of the 98 municipalities included in the project area.&#13;
Strengthening the administrative and financial management capacity and capabilities of the&#13;
municipalities is therefore a crucial factor for successful implementation of the LPP.&#13;
Project Activities&#13;
6.           Strengthening the municipalities in these areas is the primary responsibility&#13;
of the Secretaria Nacional de Participaci6n Popular (SNPP). For this purpose SNPP has&#13;
developed a series of modules to train representatives of municipalities in administration,&#13;
and financial management. The project would support SNPP in the implementation of&#13;
these modules in the 98 municipalities included in the project area. More specifically, the&#13;
project would finance a management unit of four consultants in SNPP, training activities&#13;
for trainers to be implemented by SNPP, and service contracts between SNPP and&#13;
CORDES and other EEs to actually implement the municipal strengthening activities.&#13;
7.           Municipal Administration. Municipal employees would be trained in the&#13;
use of an integrated accounting system (Sistema de Contabilidad Integrada, SICOPRE)&#13;
which would enable them to keep track of transactions in relation to the municipal budget.&#13;
After training, SICOPRE would be installed in all 98 municipalities included in the project&#13;
area. Besides accounting, attention would be paid to train municipal employees in the&#13;
preparation of the municipal budget (PAO). Personnel management would be another&#13;
module within SNPP's program to improve municipal administration. Within this module,&#13;
attention would be paid to, among others: (i) recruitment and selection procedures;&#13;
(ii) remuneration scales; (iii) terms of reference; (iv) personnel evaluation procedures;&#13;
(v) training; and (vi) internal control.&#13;
8.           Finance. The specific objective of training activities in the area of finance is&#13;
to strengthen the capacity of municipalities to raise and administer local taxes. Municipal&#13;
employees would be trained in: (i) setting-up and maintaining tax registers; (ii) collection&#13;
and administration of urban property taxes, taxes on vehicles, etc.; and (iii) preparation&#13;
and maintenance of statistics on tax collection.&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Training Program&#13;
1.          Effective implementation of participatory rural development requires&#13;
training for: (i) public institutions; (ii) Executing Agencies; and (iii) OTBs. All are&#13;
important agents to ensure that the participatory process reaches the rural communities&#13;
and that the communities are capable of responding. The objective of the training&#13;
program is to create an increasingly wide network of communicators to transmit the&#13;
precepts of Government's new rural development strategy and the technical, managerial&#13;
and administrative skills for the strategy's effective implementation in 98 municipalities,&#13;
covering 4,000 rural communities.&#13;
Purpose&#13;
2.          The training program would strengthen the training capacities of SNDR&#13;
and other relevant institutions, establishing a network of trainers. This network would&#13;
develop a cadre of community facilitators and EEs, which would bring the participatory&#13;
planning process to the rural communities and assist the communities through the process.&#13;
Specifically, the training program would include the: (i) establishment a central multi-&#13;
disciplinary team in SNDR, composed of a SNDR staff and representatives of relevant&#13;
institutions; (ii) creation of training capacity in SNDR's nine Departmental offices; and&#13;
(iii) the development and implementation of training modules for EEs, municipalities,&#13;
community leaders and farmer-experts, in selected subjects relevant to the PPP..&#13;
Network of Trainers&#13;
3.          First priority would be given to the establishment of a multi-disciplinary&#13;
team within central SNDR, composed of selected technicians from SNDR and relevant&#13;
public institutions, including: IBTA, SNAG, SAG, SPP, Energy, SNC, Natural&#13;
Resources, and others. The team members would be professionally qualified and well-&#13;
informned concerning Government's rural development strategy. During training, members&#13;
would learn how Government intends to bring the PPP to the rural communities and the&#13;
specific role each institution plays. Training would also be a forum for coordinating the&#13;
institutional activities, especially with respect to establishing and training the nine multi-&#13;
disciplinary Departmental teams.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
Action Plan&#13;
10.          SNDR would bear overall responsibility for the execution of the training&#13;
program. It would identify and evaluate the needs for institutional strengthening at all&#13;
levels, including within grassroots organizations, public and private administrative bodies,&#13;
private organizations, and within SNDR, which would coordinate training activities with&#13;
relevant institutions, especially with the Secretariat of Popular Participation.&#13;
(a)    SNDR would be primarily responsible for the preparation of didactic&#13;
methodologies and materials. When desirable, SNDR would contract a private firm for&#13;
support. The methods and materials would aim at generating and ensuring full&#13;
participation, including rural women, in the distinct phases of the PPP.&#13;
(b)   Many of the training methods have been applied with success in several&#13;
rural communities of Bolivia. But, because of the cultural diversity and varying levels of&#13;
economic development in rural sector, SNDR would continuously verify and adjust the&#13;
methodologies to ensure they are suited to the particular conditions of the communities.&#13;
Given Bolivia's linguistic and cultural diversity, unique teaching materials (in local&#13;
language) are needed to complement these training programs. Promotional materials and&#13;
teaching aids, such as radio programs, workshop guides, questionnaires, planning cards,&#13;
etc., as well as innovative employment of non-conventional communication methods, such&#13;
as puppets, graphics and audio-visual aids.&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Rural Investment Component&#13;
1.           This Annex describes briefly the sub-project cycle, eligibility criteria for&#13;
sub-projects and beneficiaries, procurement and disbursement procedures. All procedures&#13;
are or would become part of the FDC Operations Manual.&#13;
The Sub-project Cycle&#13;
2.           The processing procedures for eligible sub-projects consist of: promotion,&#13;
identification, preparation, appraisal, approval, implementation, monitoring, acceptance of&#13;
works (for infrastructure projects), operation, and ex post evaluation.&#13;
3.           Promotion. FDC would participate in the training of NGOs and other&#13;
executing entities (EE) to explain its programs and procedures. Moreover, FDC together&#13;
with the EEs would inform municipalities and OTBs on: (i) the eligibility criteria for sub-&#13;
projects; (ii) the processing steps for eligible sub-projects identified in their corresponding&#13;
Development Plans, including sample documentation and approximate times of&#13;
processing; and (iii) execution and supervision mechanisms applied by FDC.&#13;
4.           Identirication. Under the project, FDC would process sub-projects&#13;
included in municipal development plans, which may include eligible OTB development&#13;
proposals and proposals from eligible executing agencies. All proposals should&#13;
demonstrate community participation and consensus in the prioritization and identification&#13;
of the sub-project. Proposals involving the use of resources that span outside the&#13;
geographical coverage of the OTB or the municipality and where conflict may arise,&#13;
should include the participation and agreement of the community(ies) affected by the&#13;
proposed sub-project.&#13;
5.           Preparation. The primary responsibility for sub-project preparation lies&#13;
with the executing agency (which would include municipalities and OTBs). The&#13;
preparation process may take one of three possible courses: (i) the sub-project is duly&#13;
prepared according to FDC requirements and guidelines and requires no further work&#13;
prior to appraisal by FDC; (ii) the sub-project profile complies with general eligibility&#13;
criteria but requires FDC follow-up and feasibility studies; in such case, the executing&#13;
agency would apply for financial assistance from FDC to contract out these studies to&#13;
FDC-accredited professionals subject to prior assessment by the program officer on the&#13;
compliance with basic eligibility criteria; and (iii) the sub-project profile does not meet&#13;
sub-project eligibility criteria, requiring the executing agency to redesign it with guidance&#13;
from the FDC program officer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
6.           Appraisal. The FDC program officer, seconded by specialists&#13;
(consultants, CORDES staff or other), appraises the sub-project, including an&#13;
environmental analysis. Any sub-project deemed unfeasible or not compatible with&#13;
environmental standards may be rejected. The executing agency may then consider&#13;
redesigning the sub-project and submit it again to FDC.&#13;
7.           Approval. Sub-projects of up to US$80,000 are approved by the Finance&#13;
Committee. Approval criteria includes economic returns, social impact, environmental&#13;
impact and multiplier effect. Some sub-projects require further environmental analysis.&#13;
Sub-projects of more than US$80,000 require ratification by FDC's Board of Directors.&#13;
Approved sub-projects are then included in FDC's annual operating plan.&#13;
8.          Implementation. The responsibility for sub-project implementation lies&#13;
with the Co-operating Agency. Sub-project implementation rules include: (a) FDC signs&#13;
a contract with the EC; (b) the EC enters into contract with the target community (if the&#13;
target community is not an OTB eligible to act as EC); (c) the EC follows FDC bidding&#13;
procedures; (d) the target community approves the hiring of external consultants/sub-&#13;
contractors by the EC (for training and extension projects); (e) where applicable, the EC&#13;
would enter into a contract with the construction contractor or supplier of goods or&#13;
services submitting the successful bid; and (f) the EC would ensure proper project&#13;
supervision as per its contractual obligations in (a).&#13;
9.           Disbursement. FDC would make payments to ECs or directly to&#13;
contractors and/or beneficiaries. Advances to ECs, contractors or communities are paid&#13;
upon provision of a Bank Guarantee or against SOEs. The low technical and&#13;
administrative capacity of many ECs, together with the weakness of FDC's Departmental&#13;
offices, are two major causes of slow FDC disbursement. Most grassroots organizations&#13;
have little experience in bidding procedures and have difficulties in providing Bank&#13;
Guarantees, which is required by Bolivian law before the disbursement of any advance.&#13;
FDC plans to set up a COTESU financed Guarantee Fund for ECs and beneficiaries to&#13;
avoid this complex Bank Guarantee procedure.&#13;
10.          Monitoring. The monitoring of the sub-project is shared by the executing&#13;
agency, the beneficiary community and the FDC program officer in a pre-determined&#13;
written arrangement. FDC has a planning, monitoring, and evaluation system detailing the&#13;
specific instruments and the responsibilities of each. The implementation of this system&#13;
requires a remarkable effort of the Departmental offices, which would be strengthened&#13;
under the project.&#13;
11.         Acceptance of Works. The responsibility for certifying due and proper&#13;
fulfillment of conditions of the sub-project is shared by the EC, the beneficiary community&#13;
and the program officer (if applicable, with the assistance of specialists at FDC&#13;
headquarters and regional offices). All three parties issue an approval and formal&#13;
certification of due and proper project sub-project performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
12.         Operation, Maintenance and Ex-post Evaluation. The beneficiary&#13;
community is primary responsible for sub-project operation. However, the EC would&#13;
maintain a presence throughout the initial phase to ensure due and proper sub-project&#13;
operation, provision of technical assistance services, maintenance and ex-post evaluation.&#13;
Sub-project Eligibility Criteria&#13;
13.         Under the project, the eligibility of sub-projects would be evaluated by&#13;
FDC in accordance with its own procedures and would include the following criteria:&#13;
(i)   sub-projects must be identified by rural communities through a&#13;
participatory process and be included in the municipal development plan;&#13;
(ii)  the technical feasibility of all the sub-project phases - from investment to&#13;
operation- has to be attained;&#13;
(iii) sub-projects must have a minimum Economic Internal Rate of Return of&#13;
12 percent;&#13;
(iv)   participation of women is included in the proposal;&#13;
(v)   sub-project design has to show the needed flexibility to answer future&#13;
problems and to generate a multiplier effect;&#13;
(vi)  the environmental impact of the sub-project is to be evaluated and where&#13;
necessary, environmental impact mitigation measures are to be proposed; and&#13;
(vii)  construction must take less than one year and not exceed US$250,000.&#13;
14.         The economic evaluation of sub-projects is done on the basis of sub-project&#13;
prototypes (proyecto tipo). FDC has estimated basic parameters for every sub-project&#13;
prototype. These parameters are then adjusted to the actual sub-project, such as the&#13;
number of beneficiaries and unit costs.&#13;
15.         Typical sub-project would include basic infrastructure sub-projects,&#13;
production support sub-projects and institutional strengthening sub-projects. Basic&#13;
infrastructure sub-projects would not be eligible for financing by IFAD.&#13;
Basic Infrastructure Sub-projects&#13;
16.         Access Roads. The project would finance the rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of access roads linking remote communities in production zones to rural&#13;
markets and feeder roads. Eligible access roads would be one-blade roads of a to 6 m&#13;
wide (4 m in the hilly regions, 6 m in the Lowlands and highland plateaus) and&#13;
complement the existing system of feeder roads of the National Road Service (Servicio&#13;
Nacional Caminos, SNC). Construction of new roads and improvement of roads in&#13;
environmentally sensitive areas such as forests, national parks and protected areas&#13;
would not be financed. Costs should not exceed US$15,000 per km.&#13;
17.         Bridges. The project would only finance bridges in areas where such&#13;
investment solves an access problem, where the bridge complements a road access and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
where the bridges would not create significant environmental problems . Vehicle bridges&#13;
should not be more than 50 meters long and four meters wide, cost less than US$3,000&#13;
per meter (for vehicles) and US$1,000 per meter (for walkers)--total maximum FDC&#13;
contribution would be US$150,000.&#13;
18.         Small-Scale Irrigation. The project would finance small-scale irrigation&#13;
schemes not exceeding US$250,000 per sub-project and US$2,500 per ha. Additional&#13;
requirements would be that the beneficiary community owns the land and has access to&#13;
roads for produce marketing.&#13;
19.         Markets, Storage Centers and Artisanal Workshops. The project&#13;
would finance infrastructure for markets, storage centers and artisanal workshops under&#13;
the following rules: the land on which to build would legally belong to the beneficiaries;&#13;
internal rules of the beneficiary communities provide systems to pay for operation and&#13;
maintenance; markets would not cost more than US$100 per m2 covered; and (iv) FDC's&#13;
maximum contribution would be US$50,000.&#13;
Production Support Sub-projects&#13;
20.         Rural Technical Assistance and Extension Services. The project would&#13;
finance the demand from communities for rural extension services including the equipment&#13;
and tools needed for the services. Services would include: technical assistance and&#13;
training for farmers, livestock holders, natural resources management, agro-forestry,&#13;
technology transfer, and assistance to produce marketing. Costs per sub-project should&#13;
not exceed US$150 per sub-project beneficiary.&#13;
21.         Revolving Funds for Agricultural Inputs. This type of FDC sub-&#13;
projects would not be eligible for financing under the project.&#13;
22.         Rural Experimental Activities. Maximum US$250,000 of the IFAD&#13;
contribution could be used to finance small specific experiments and research activities&#13;
including adaptive agricultural research in communities to experiment with new varieties&#13;
and crops, agricultural processing and other similar activities. Each sub-project would not&#13;
exceed US$25,000.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening Sub-projects&#13;
23.         Institutional Strengthening of the Beneficiary Community. The&#13;
project would finance training of beneficiary communities through courses, seminars,&#13;
workshops to interchange experiences between communities, contracting of technical&#13;
assistance to improve the management and organization of the OTBs, and provision of&#13;
tools and equipment to carry out the agreed activities. Under the IFAD component, FDC&#13;
would also finance the instutional strengthening of co-operating agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
Pre-Investment Studies&#13;
24.          The project would finance pre-investment studies carried out by consulting&#13;
firms recruited by ECs or by the ECs themselves. These pre-investment studies refer to&#13;
studies done after the sub-project profiles have been accepted.&#13;
Local Human Resources Development&#13;
25.          Following demands expressed in PMDs the objective is to increase the&#13;
capacity of rural communities to more effectively participate in the PPP and sub-project&#13;
preparation by training selected individuals. Training activities could consist of short&#13;
courses, workshops, formal education, etc. It is envisaged that existing training centers,&#13;
often managed by NGOs, would act as executing agency for this type of projects. Since&#13;
demand is expected to be fragmented, SNDR would act as an intermediary by putting&#13;
together requests from various PMDs and inviting executing agencies to prepare concrete&#13;
proposals to be considered for financing by FDC. For this purpose a total of US$700,000&#13;
would provided to FDC. However, if demand for this type of projects is lower than&#13;
expected these resources would be used to finance other types of sub-projects.&#13;
Eligibility Criteria for Beneficiaries&#13;
26.          Beneficiaries include municipalities and OTBs. Peasant families associated&#13;
in communities or productive groups of at least ten families, mostly working in agriculture&#13;
with traditional technologies, with a limited access to resources and services and in the&#13;
process of becoming an OTB would be able to make requests for assistance from FDC.&#13;
Beneficiary Contributions&#13;
27.          Table 1 (below) summarizes the beneficiary contributions which could be&#13;
provided in cash, labor and materials or in a combination thereof.&#13;

Procurement Procedures&#13;
28.            Works and Goods. FDC's procurement procedures for sub-project goods&#13;
and works are as follows:&#13;
(a)     Contracts costing less than US$20,000. ECs and communities would&#13;
procure goods and works through direct invitation of at least three&#13;
suppliers;&#13;
(b)    Contracts costing between US$20,000 and 50,000. ECs and communities&#13;
launch local competitive bidding. The invitation is to be advertised in the&#13;
press. Minimum time period for bid submission from appearance of&#13;
advertisement is 20 days. If local competitive bidding would be&#13;
unsuccessful because of lack of offers, the EC and community would be&#13;
allowed to proceed to direct invitation of three suppliers/contractors;&#13;
(c)    Contracts costing between US$50,000 and 250.000. ECs and communities&#13;
launch national competitive bidding (NCB). The invitation is advertised in&#13;
the national press. Minimum time period for bid submission from&#13;
appearance of advertisement is 20 days.&#13;
(d)    Works by communities. Where no contractors are available, the project&#13;
would finance works carried out by the communities themselves on the&#13;
basis of statements of expenses up to a maximum of US$50,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
(e)    Works under direct management. The project would finance works carried&#13;
out under direct oversight of the ECs and municipalities up to a maximum&#13;
of US$80,000 per project. Above such amount, a contractor, recruited&#13;
through NCB, has to carry out the works.&#13;
29.          Under the project, FDC's procedures for NCB would be modified as&#13;
follows. The "two envelope" bid opening (i.e., all technical envelops are opened first and,&#13;
after review, price envelopes of qualified/responsive bids are opened in the second round)&#13;
would be replaced with a public bid opening and announcement of the bid prices and&#13;
discounts. The EC's evaluation committee (on which FDC has a veto-powered vote)&#13;
would carry out a post-qualification of the lowest responsive bidder on the basis of&#13;
minimum criteria mentioned in the bidding documents. If the lowest responsive bidder&#13;
would not qualify, the second-lowest responsive bidder would be evaluated, etc. The&#13;
present bracketing rule of discarding all proposals which are 15 percent below the FDC&#13;
cost estimate would be abandoned.&#13;
30.          Co-operating Agencies (CE). The communities and/or municipalities&#13;
normally select a CE and proposes its financing by FDC, which evaluates the capacity of&#13;
the proposed CE in three steps. First, FDC evaluates the CE's legal status: official&#13;
organizational status and declaration of fully empowered representative(s). Second,&#13;
FDC's Departmental representative undertakes a technical evaluation which requires at&#13;
least one site visit and takes into consideration the CE's capability to execute the contract&#13;
satisfactorily, based on its experience, available human resources and equipment, and its&#13;
ties with the beneficiary community. The third step is the financial evaluation of the CE's&#13;
proposal to examine whether it fits within FDC's financial limits.&#13;
31.          A CE which is eligible to implement one type of sub-project, for instance&#13;
rural infrastructure, is not necessarily eligible to implement sub-project of a different kind.&#13;
Eligibility criteria for different sub-project categories are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Road Infrastructure: (i) minimum of two years of experience in the field;&#13;
(ii) availability of at least one specialist with a minimum of three years of experience in the&#13;
field; and (iii) availability of a minimum amount of engineering and topographic&#13;
equipment.&#13;
(b)   Irrigation: (i) minimum of two years of experience in the field;&#13;
(ii) availability of at least one specialist with a minimum two years of experience in the&#13;
field; (iii) one completed project covering at least 10 ha; (iv) availability of a minimum&#13;
amount of engineering and topographic equipment; and (v) availability of technical&#13;
assistance for the management of the irrigation system.&#13;
(c)   Natural Resource Management. Extension and Agro-Processing:&#13;
(i) minimum of two years of experience with the community or in very similar conditions;&#13;
(ii) minimum of two years of experience in supervision of similar projects; (iii) availability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
of at least one specialist with a minimum two years of experience the field; and (iv) access&#13;
to sources of technology.&#13;
(d)   Institutional Strengthening: (i) submit evidence of sources of funds&#13;
covering at least 50 percent of operative costs; (ii) availability of at least one specialist&#13;
with a minimum two years of experience in the field and able to speak the local language.&#13;
(e)   Pre-Investment Studies: above criteria for the different project categories&#13;
also apply for pre-investment studies for the respective types of sub-project.&#13;
32.          Consulting Services. Consultants recruited to carry out more complex&#13;
irrigation studies and work supervision are to be recruited in accordance with IDA-&#13;
acceptable guidelines for recruitment of consultants. A two-stage procedure is being&#13;
adopted, with the technical and financial proposals submitted separately in sealed&#13;
envelopes. The technical evaluation is carried out first and counts for 40 percent in the&#13;
ranking. The price evaluation counts for 60 percent of the ranking. The cost of&#13;
engineering services for sub-project preparation should not exceed 10 percent of the costs&#13;
of the works.&#13;
Disbursement Procedures&#13;
33.         In accordance with the law, FDC does not make any advance payments to&#13;
contractors without requiring a bank guarantee. This requirement delays sub-project&#13;
disbursements. COTESU has shown interest in financing a small guarantee fund to&#13;
diminish the number of occasions in which a bank guarantee is required. IDA funds would&#13;
not be used to provide sub-project advances to contractors or EEs without the required&#13;
bank guarantee. Payments for works carried out by beneficiaries and/or under direct&#13;
management by municipalities and EEs are to be done on the basis of statement of&#13;
expenditures to be controlled by regular audits.&#13;

ANNEX 10&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures&#13;
1.          Overall, the project would have a positive environmental impact. Sub-&#13;
projects to improve integrated watershed management, forestry, pasture management,&#13;
agricultural practices, etc., would generate a positive environmental impact. The training&#13;
and capacity-building components would include sustainable natural resource&#13;
management, thus generating a long-term benefits for the environment. The project,&#13;
however, would implement sub-projects which may have some limited negative impact on&#13;
the environment. Rural infrastructure such as improvements of access roads, small scale&#13;
irrigation works, processing and marketing facilities, etc. could create localized&#13;
environmental problems. The project would neither finance sub-projects related to&#13;
opening of new roads, nor to road improvement in sensitive forest areas. The project&#13;
would not finance sub-projects involving resettlement.&#13;
2.          The Bolivian Environment Law (Ley 1333) requires that all sub-projects be&#13;
carefully reviewed for environmental impact during feasibility studies and, when&#13;
appropriate, mitigation measures be designed for implementation. The law makes a&#13;
distinction between four categories of environmental impact. For Category I projects with&#13;
strong environmental impact, a full environmental assessment has to be carried out. Such&#13;
projects include activities with a wide national impact, important modifications in the&#13;
characteristics of the environment, localization close to protected areas, forest zones and&#13;
human settlements likely to be affected, resettlement of people, introduction of changes in&#13;
the social, cultural and economic conditions of the people. Category II projects require a&#13;
specific environmental analysis of those activities which may harm the environment.&#13;
Category III projects may need to be conceptually reviewed to mitigate some particular&#13;
minor environmental impact. Category IV projects have no impact on the environment&#13;
and need not to be analyzed.&#13;
3.          For each sub-project, EEs would complete an environmental evaluation&#13;
form (Ficha Ambiental) which describes the sub-project's environmental impact. FDC's&#13;
environmental unit would review the form and give it a provisional environmental&#13;
category. FDC would send this information in bulk to the Ministry of Sustainable&#13;
Development and Environment, responsible for the screening and which would review&#13;
FDC's assessment on a sample basis. Under this project, no sub-projects of Category I&#13;
would be financed.&#13;
4.          Access Roads. The project would finance rehabilitation and spot&#13;
improvement of existing roads, where the environmental problems have been tackled in&#13;
the initial design. Building of new access roads would not be financed. Special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
environmental mitigation measures would be taken to avoid environmental damage during&#13;
improvement of the roads. The table below describes possible impact, likelihood of the&#13;
occurrence and the proposed mitigation measures.&#13;

5.            Small-Scale Irrigation. The project would only finance small-scale&#13;
irrigation not exceeding 100 ha or US$250,000. Such small-scale irrigation works include&#13;
the construction or improvement of canals, the damming of small water currents to allow&#13;
water storage, and construction of land terraces. Such small works mostly do not have a&#13;
significant environmental impact. However, they may cause lack of water downstream,&#13;
water quality degradation because of chemicals used in the more intensive irrigated&#13;
agriculture, and changes in the local water table. On Table 2 the likelihood of occurrence&#13;
and eventual mitigation measures are highlighted.&#13;

6.            Processing and Market Facilities. Environmental problems related to&#13;
these kinds of sub-projects are mainly health and sanitation related: water supply, refuse&#13;
collection, sewerage, and clean-up facilities. Poor hygiene and lack of water supply often&#13;
turn out into food contamination and health hazards. Some kind of processing could&#13;
produce polluting sewerage, while others might cause other hazards such as borrow-pits.&#13;
In all these cases, FDC would impose mitigation measures.&#13;

            The Rural Communities Development
            Project will: (a) alleviate rural poverty by carrying out
            rural investments identified and formulated following a
            participatory planning process; (b) enhance the
            institutional capacity of the Secretariat for Rural
            Development (SNDR), the Small-Farmer Development Fund (FDC),
            and the Secretariat for Popular Participation (SNPP) to
            carry out the project; (c) improve the capacity of
            municipalities and rural communities to implement municipal
            development plans (PMD); and (d) strengthen non-governmental
            organizations (NGOs) assisting municipalities and rural
            communities in identifying, formulating and implementing
            rural investments and managing their PMDs.
