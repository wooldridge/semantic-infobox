Utility Regulation- A Critical Path for&#13;
Revising Price Controls&#13;
Richard Green      Many countries are privatizing their infrastructure sectors, setting up independent regulatory&#13;
agencies, and putting in place transparent control instruments and processes for the regulator to&#13;
ensure that newly private firms do not abuse their monopoly powers. The United Kingdom was&#13;
one of the first to privatize utilities, selling off British Telecom in 1984, British Gas in 1986, the&#13;
water industry in 1989, and the electricity industry in 1990. The United Kingdom also pioneered&#13;
the use of price control regulation. At the core of this regulatory mechanism is the periodic&#13;
review of price controls, which the U.K. experience shows is complex, time-consuming, and&#13;
often controversial. Based on the U.K. experience, this Note proposes a sequence of tasks that&#13;
regulators in other countries could use when revising their price controls.&#13;
In the mid-1980s, some commentators thought&#13;
that price controls were fundamentally differ-&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The United Kingdom has pioneered the use
            of price control regulation. The periodic review of these
            controls lies at the core of the mechanism, and the UK
            experience shows that this review is complex and
            time-consuming and can be controversial. Based on the UK
            experience the author proposes a sequence of tasks that
            regulators in other countries could use when revising price
            controls. He argues that regulators should start to reset
            controls at least two years before new controls are due to
            come into effect. Much information will be required, and it
            will all have to be checked and processed before the
            regulator can propose new controls. In addition, most
            regulatory systems include an appeals mechanism to protect
            companies against overly zealous regulators, so regulators
            must make their proposals early enough to allow for a
            possible appeal. These considerations imply that regulators
            should make their proposals at least nine months before new
            controls are due to take effect, to allow six months for an
            appeal and time to implement the eventual decision.
