ASSAM-RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                      India, Acting by its President&#13;
Executing Agency:              Government of Assam (GOA) through the&#13;
Departments of Agriculture, Public Works,&#13;
Fisheries, Irrigation, Animal Husbandry and&#13;
Veterinary, and Assam State Agricultural&#13;
University.&#13;
Amount:                         IDA Credit of SDR 81.0 million (US$126.0 million&#13;
equivalent).&#13;
Terms:                         Standard with 35 years maturity.&#13;
On-lending Terms:              Government of India (GOI) would make the&#13;
proceeds of the credit available to GOA under&#13;
its prevailing terms and conditions. GOI would&#13;
assume the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Poverty Categorv:              Program of Targeted Interventions.  The project&#13;
aims to benefit the poorest section of the rural&#13;
population in the State of Assam by offering&#13;
better income enhancement opportunities to&#13;
poorer farmers, and particularly to women, and&#13;
to improve their nutritional status. The&#13;
project contains specific mechanisms for&#13;
targeting these groups. The project also&#13;
incorporates specific measures to ensure&#13;
beneficiaries' participation in the selection of&#13;
location and implementation of activities&#13;
supported under the project.&#13;
Project Obiectives:            The primary objectives of the project would be&#13;
to (a) improve equity and alleviate poverty by&#13;
offering better opportunities for poorer farmers&#13;
and women to contribute to agricultural growth&#13;
and income generation; (b) improve the nutrition&#13;
of the rural poor; (c) accelerate agricultural&#13;
growth through improved use of resources,&#13;
relieving infrastructural and technical&#13;
constraints, and providing an enabling&#13;
environment to facilitate the growth of private&#13;
sector investments; (d) encourage sustainability&#13;
of resource use and quality of the environment;&#13;
and (e) improve the GOA's long-term capacity for&#13;
strategic agricultural planning. An attempt&#13;
would be made to balance its policy reform&#13;
objectives with poverty alleviation goals&#13;
through careful targeting of beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-ll-&#13;
Proiect DescriDtion:           The project is intended to benefit the poorest&#13;
segments of the rural population. To achieve&#13;
this objective, the project would support: (a)&#13;
the Department of Agriculture's work program,&#13;
including the extension services for&#13;
horticulture, fisheries, and livestock to poor&#13;
rural communities aimed at increasing their&#13;
production; (b) institutional development&#13;
(technology generation and extension, seed&#13;
multiplication and land administration, and&#13;
planning and coordination); and (c) rural&#13;
infrastructure (small scale irrigation and rural&#13;
roads). Project components would also include a&#13;
number of studies considered necessary for&#13;
improving the use of natural resources (soil and&#13;
water management) and the marketing of highly&#13;
perishable horticultural products. The proposed&#13;
project would be implemented in eight years&#13;
starting in 1995/96 and would include a package&#13;
of state-specific policy reforms agreed to by&#13;
the Bank and formally approved by the GOA.&#13;
Risks:                         The project faces four major risks:&#13;
Fundinct. Poor budgetary support could slow down&#13;
implementation. To minimize the risk, the GOA&#13;
would submit an annual budget and commit itself&#13;
to improve cost recovery and establish adequate&#13;
financial control measures that would be&#13;
monitored during project implementation.&#13;
Funding needed for O&amp;M would be the&#13;
responsibility of the beneficiaries. Pace of&#13;
implementation, quality of construction, and&#13;
delivery of services would be monitored by local&#13;
NGOs and reported to concerned agencies every&#13;
six months.&#13;
Policy Reform and Commitment. Timely and&#13;
effective implementation and adherence by the&#13;
GOA to the agreed policy reforms are crucial to&#13;
the success of the project. To minimize the&#13;
risk, tangible proof of readiness to implement&#13;
the reforms has already been demonstrated in the&#13;
preparation of the state agricultural strategy&#13;
paper and the steps already taken to implement&#13;
the items described in the policy matrix.&#13;
Implementation of policy reforms would be&#13;
reflected in the GOA's annual work plans and&#13;
budgets for Bank review. There would be close&#13;
Bank supervision to ensure that dated covenants&#13;
associated with the reforms are met. Despite&#13;
the built-in safeguard*, however, implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-iii-&#13;
of policy reform could be delayed or even&#13;
modified due to political events. General&#13;
elections will be held in 1996, and the&#13;
political scenario in the country is changing&#13;
fast. Announcements of populistic measures&#13;
involving hand-outs from public funds are&#13;
increasing markedly. It would be unrealistic to&#13;
expect that Assam would not be influenced by&#13;
this political trend.&#13;
Institutional Capacity. The success of the&#13;
project depends on active participation of local&#13;
and national NGOs. There is the risk that such&#13;
participation may be slow to materialize, and&#13;
government bureaucracy may delay the transfer of&#13;
new assets to the farming communities. Also,&#13;
institutional weakness could pose risks for&#13;
project implementation. Quality of works&#13;
(construction and maintenance of rural roads)&#13;
could suffer from inadequate staffing,&#13;
supervision, and standard enforcement. To&#13;
enhance quality of construction, the project&#13;
would provide technical assistance to train and&#13;
motivate staff.&#13;
Securit . The security situation in Assam may&#13;
delay field visits, implementation, and timely&#13;
supervision and monitoring. Project activities&#13;
and investment programs would be restricted to&#13;
areas where security problems are minimal.&#13;
Active involvement of beneficiaries (FMCs, WUA,&#13;
etc) in the decision-making process and their&#13;
ownership of the project should reduce the&#13;
security risk.&#13;
With GOA's commitment and demonstrated support,&#13;
and with built-in safeguards for sustaining&#13;
operations, the project has a chance of&#13;
succeeding.&#13;

I. BACKGROUND&#13;
The Economy and Agriculture of India&#13;
1.1       In 1991 the Government of India (GOI) started to liberalize the&#13;
country's economy with a reform program focused on the investment regime,&#13;
trade policies, financial sector, public enterprises, and taxation. The&#13;
economy has responded positively to the stabilization and reform measures&#13;
implemented, but macroeconomic stress brought about by the reform program&#13;
poses new challenges for policy. Growth recovered from 2% per year, in&#13;
1991/92 to around 4% per year in 1993/94. Details of the macroeconomic&#13;
performance are described in the Bank Report "Recent Economic Developments and&#13;
Prospects for India (Report No. 12940-IN)" of May 27, 1994.&#13;
1.2       Agricultural growth has averaged 2.6% per annum over the last two&#13;
decades, slightly above the population growth rate of 2.1%. Despite&#13;
comparatively modest growth, agriculture remains important to the Indian&#13;
economy. Though agriculture's share of GDP is only about 35%, a large&#13;
percentage of India's population of 880 million is dependent on the sector.&#13;
About 75% of India's people live in rural areas, and about 64% are directly&#13;
employed in agriculture.&#13;
1.3       Though the performance of the agricultural sector has improved over&#13;
the same period (for example, through increased exports), there remain long-&#13;
standing issues facing the development of agriculture in India. Without&#13;
broad-ranging reforms, the prospects for accelerated, sustainable, and&#13;
equitable growth are not encouraging. Some contributing factors for the&#13;
inadequate performance of the agricultural sector, some of which were brought&#13;
out in the Bank's recent public expenditure review, include excessive&#13;
expenditures for subsidies on inputs and outputs, low levels of cost recovery&#13;
for services provided by government, restrictions on both domestic and&#13;
external trade, and the weak structure of the rural credit system.&#13;
1.4       Public expenditures on agriculture have been increasing at about 5%&#13;
per year in real terms, with the recurrent component increasing at about 8%&#13;
and the capital formation component declining by about 2%. These trends,&#13;
evident at both the central and the state level, are unsustainable and have&#13;
become worse over the past five years. The challenge for the future is to&#13;
accelerate growth by improving the technical, financial, and economic&#13;
efficiencies in the sector while paying greater attention to the equity&#13;
aspects of development, the sustainability of the production base, and the&#13;
preservation of the environment.&#13;
1.5       Although public expenditures have been instrumental in facilitating&#13;
agricultural growth, Indian agriculture is at a critical stage. Gains in the&#13;
agricultural sector have not been sufficiently large to alleviate poverty&#13;
among the growing population. The challenge is to increase the growth rate of&#13;
production to support population growth and raise living standards. This&#13;
requires a critical reevaluation of the composition of public expenditure and&#13;
the efficiency of allocation.&#13;
&#13;

Maior Issues Affectinc Acricultural Performance&#13;
1.6       Inadeauate Economic Liberalization.  The incomplete liberalization&#13;
of the trade regime, in particular for consumer goods, continues to&#13;
discriminate against agriculture by depressing farmers' incentives to invest&#13;
and produce. Within agriculture, government price controls, market&#13;
interventions, and trade regulations restrict growth opportunities.&#13;
1.7       Central and State government.  Although the broad economic&#13;
environment is under the control of the central government, the constitution&#13;
assigns responsibility for agriculture to the states. The central government&#13;
finances about 40% of agricultural expenditure at the state level but does not&#13;
influence the composition of the states' public expenditures. As a result of&#13;
this shared responsibility, any reform process becomes difficult to implement.&#13;
1.8       Sustainabilitv Effects.  Distortions in the incentive structure and&#13;
management weakness not only reduce growth but also threaten its long-term&#13;
sustainability. The two main issues are (a) over-exploitation and inefficient&#13;
use of the natural resource base induced by pricing distortions, such as&#13;
underpricing of water and power, and (b) poor operation and maintenance of&#13;
irrigation and other infrastructure.&#13;
1.9       Major land and water resources in India have been developed and&#13;
utilized. Future growth must depend largely on intensified production (on&#13;
both irrigated and rainfed land), crop diversification and increased&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
The GOI's Agricultural Strateov&#13;
1.10      The GOI's long-term strategy is to stimulate agricultural growth&#13;
and promote rural development through improved water and land management,&#13;
enhanced efficiency of irrigation and drainage networks, strengthened research&#13;
services, increased attention to environmental protection, and improved rural&#13;
infrastructure. Investment programs to address these elements and to&#13;
reestablish growth are assigned a high priority in the Eighth Five-Year Plan&#13;
(1992/97) of the GOI and state governments. The Plan also emphasizes&#13;
equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and sustainability of the&#13;
resource base.&#13;
1.11      According to the Plan, increasing public support for agriculture&#13;
would focus on horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and sericulture. The plan&#13;
aims at infusing new dynamism through redirecting public investments in&#13;
infrastructural development and promoting private investment in the&#13;
agricultural sector. The Plan gives priority to improving rainfed agriculture&#13;
through diversification, creating incentives for exports, increasing the role&#13;
of the private sector, enhancing the effectiveness of the safety net programs,&#13;
and using natural resources in a sustainable manner.&#13;
&#13;

The State of Assam&#13;
1.12      Assam, the largest of seven northeastern states, is among the&#13;
poorest in the country. About 60% of the rural population have incomes below&#13;
the official poverty line of Rs 7,800 (US$240) per household per year. The&#13;
State covers an area of 78,000 sq km, of which 34,000 sq km (44%) are&#13;
cultivable; the remainder is under forest or uncultivable. The State mainly&#13;
comprises the valley of the Brahmaputra River, stretching from the Himalayan&#13;
foothills in the northeast to its entry into Bangladesh in the southwest.&#13;
There are three main regions: the flat, rice-dominated valley bottom; the&#13;
foothill areas, which to the north and east are largely under tea cultivation;&#13;
and the less prosperous, hilly tracts to the south bordering the states of&#13;
Meghalaya and Nagaland.&#13;
1.13      The population of Assam is estimated at 22.3 million, with a growth&#13;
rate of 3.6% per year, compared to 2.7% for all India. The most striking&#13;
feature is the growing unemployment among educated youths, estimated at almost&#13;
60%. Even for those with steady incomes from employment, wages have been&#13;
declining in real terms over the last 20 years. Minimum wages in Assam&#13;
average Rs 15 per day compared with Rs 23 to 25 per day in other states such&#13;
as Haryana, Punjab, and Manipur.&#13;
Agriculture in Assam: Constraints and Potential&#13;
1.14      Rainfall in Assam averages over 2,000 mm per year, permitting&#13;
double-cropping in many areas. The state suffers from frequent floods, soil&#13;
erosion, and low cropping intensity. Surface and groundwater resources are&#13;
abundant but have not been exploited fully. Despite good water resources, the&#13;
average yield of rice, the dominant crop, is only 1,150 kg per hectare, well&#13;
below the national average of 1,500 kg per ha. Where irrigation facilities&#13;
exist, higher yields can and are being obtained from the dry season rice crop.&#13;
There is considerable potential for agricultural growth by increasing cropping&#13;
intensity, raising rice yields, and diversifying into higher-value activities&#13;
such as horticulture, fisheries, and dairy production.&#13;
1.15      Issues affecting agricultural growth in the state include:&#13;
(a) poorly developed input supply services;&#13;
(b) inadequacy of groundwater development;&#13;
(c) poorly developed rural infrastructure (e.g., rural roads,&#13;
marketing, electrification, and communications);&#13;
(d) problems of flood management and drainage in flood-prone areas; and&#13;
(e) failure to tailor agricultural research and technology transfer to&#13;
local conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.16      The poor performance of the agricultural sector in the State is&#13;
partly caused by a low level of fertilizer use, poor quality seed, inadequate&#13;
use of conjunctive irrigation with high rainfall, small and fragmented land&#13;
holdings, absence of rural credit, and deficiencies in research and extension&#13;
services. Government policies have traditionally promoted public sector&#13;
control of input distribution, reduce direct public expenditure for capital&#13;
formation in the agricultural sector, restrict private sector involvement in&#13;
the provision of essential goods and services, subsidize inefficient public&#13;
corporations, and distort competition. Resources for operation and&#13;
maintenance of public infrastructure, including irrigation and drainage, rural&#13;
roads, and power generating units, have routinely been inadequate.&#13;
1.17      Intensification and diversification of agriculture are essential&#13;
for accelerating growth in Assam. This shift requires a strategic approach to&#13;
increase productivity and minimize crop losses that distributes risk and&#13;
encourages small farmers to respond to changes in market and production&#13;
technology. The average farm size of 1.3 hectares is the smallest in the&#13;
country and declining. These small land holdings are fragmented further into&#13;
3 to 4 parcels, making them uneconomic units to support the average family of&#13;
five. Land consolidation should encourage intensification of agriculture in&#13;
the large flood-free areas, on the recharged aquifers, in perennial streams&#13;
and rivulets, and in the vast low-lying areas with adequate residual moisture&#13;
to raise early-maturing second crops. Successful intensification would&#13;
require revamped agricultural research and extension services, staff training,&#13;
infrastructure development, and a supportive policy environment.&#13;
1.18      In the period 1984/94 rice production in the state increased by an&#13;
average of 4t annually, partly due to area expansion (from 2.3 to 2.5 million&#13;
hectares) and yield improvement (from 990 to 1,150 kg per hectare). The&#13;
potential for further area expansion is almost exhausted. Small farmers could&#13;
achieve this target if the research and extension service could speed the&#13;
adoption of (a) high-yielding varieties of rice for the spring (Ahu) and&#13;
summer (Boro) seasons, (b) improved early-maturing varieties of oilseeds and&#13;
pulses suited for limited moisture stress conditions, and (c) efficient use of&#13;
fertilizers.   If small farmers in Assam increased cropping intensity by 10 to&#13;
15% annually, Assam's food production would double during the next 10 years.&#13;
1.19      The GOA recently formulated an agricultural strategy to foster&#13;
growth and development. The strategy includes policy adjustment and targets&#13;
small and poor farming communities to (a) develop area-specific assets and&#13;
infrastructure required to support productive and sustainable farming systems;&#13;
(b) plan and execute relevant research, extension, and training programs for&#13;
accelerated agricultural growth, and (c) create a favorable policy and&#13;
investment framework and an enabling environment for active private sector&#13;
participation.&#13;
1.20      The GOA has succeeded in enlisting the support of the World Food&#13;
Program, local and national NGOs, and other bilateral agencies to implement&#13;
this strategy. This collaboration has already resulted in several small-scale&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
projects for fish production, livestock improvement, groundwater development,&#13;
and road construction in rural India. Further resources will be needed to&#13;
expand these development activities.&#13;
The Bank's ADnroach to Aariculture in Assam&#13;
1.21      The Bank's current approach to agriculture is to assist the GOA in&#13;
(a) expanding successful development experiences to poor communities, (b)&#13;
intensifying the use both human capital and natural resources; (c) improving&#13;
the management of its resources through policy reforms and institutional&#13;
development; and (d) redressing inequities.&#13;
World Bank SuDDort&#13;
1.22      The Bank has supported agriculture and rural development in India&#13;
since the early 1950s. One hundred thirty-three projects have received IBRD&#13;
or IDA financing totaling US$10.6 billion equivalent (81% IDA and 19% IBRD).&#13;
Of these projects, 53 were for irrigation and command area development (US$5.2&#13;
billion equivalent, or 50% of total agricultural lending). The remaining 80&#13;
projects can be subdivided as follows: (a) 34 for agricultural support&#13;
services (credit, research, and extension), at US$2.3 billion equivalent; (b)&#13;
24 for commercial agriculture development (fisheries, livestock, tree crops,&#13;
and agro-industry), at US$1.6 billion equivalent; (c) 12 for forestry, at&#13;
US$500 million equivalent; and (d) 10 other projects including area&#13;
development, drought assistance, and cyclone emergency projects, at US$950&#13;
million equivalent.&#13;
1.23      In policy reform and lending for agriculture, the Bank has&#13;
supported two agricultural development projects (ADPs) in Tamil Nadu and&#13;
Rajasthan whose implementation has been satisfactory. The Government of Tamil&#13;
Nadu (GOTN) has eliminated subsidies for agricultural inputs including seeds,&#13;
fertilizers, and pesticides. The Government of Rajasthan has increased&#13;
expenditure for long-term investment in agriculture by 20% and streamlined its&#13;
recurrent expenditure, and removed several distortions in its current&#13;
agricultural policies.&#13;
1.24      The Bank Group has also supported an ADP (Cr.728-IN) with an amount&#13;
of US$8.0 million for Assam alone as well as 12 other projects, which Assam&#13;
participated along with other states, for a total credit and loan amount&#13;
equivalent to US$2.2 billion. Although the proposed project is similar to the&#13;
earlier ADP, the earlier ADP lacked policy reforms. The other projects&#13;
include four Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation Credit&#13;
Projects (Cr. 540-IN, 715-IN, 947-IN, and 1209-IN and Ln. 2095-IN), two&#13;
National Dairy Projects (Cr. 824-IN and 859-IN and Ln. 2893-IN), two National&#13;
Agricultural Research Projects (Cr. 855-IN and 1631-IN), the National&#13;
Agricultural Extension Project (Cr. 1754-IN), the National Bank for&#13;
Agricultural and Rural Development Project (Ln. 2653), the National Seeds&#13;
Project (Cr. 1952-IN), and the Food Grain Storage Project (Cr. 747-IN).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement&#13;
1.25      Many agricultural projects that the Bank has supported have&#13;
experienced implementation problems causing delays in disbursement and&#13;
completion, although there has recently been improvement in disbursements.&#13;
Problems include delays in project mobilization and procurement; poor quality&#13;
construction and maintenance of infrastructure (e.g., irrigation, rural&#13;
roads); institutional weaknesses; inadequate financial support by the state&#13;
governments; inadequate preparation and implementation of resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation programs for affected families; and poor maintenance of assets&#13;
created by projects. Some projects have faced staff constraints as well.&#13;
Others have provided for only limited participation of beneficiaries,&#13;
including NGOs and women, in project planning and implementation.&#13;
1.26      Because the proposed project includes large investments in rural&#13;
roads and irrigation, lessons from the Bihar Rural Roads Project (Cr. 1072-IN)&#13;
and the Tube Wells Project in Bihar and West Bengal are relevant. Although&#13;
the Bihar Rural Roads Project achieved impressive physical targets of road&#13;
construction within the project period, the design, quality of construction,&#13;
and road maintenance were poor. As a result, the life of these roads was much&#13;
shorter than expected. Also, public tube wells in Bihar failed to irrigate&#13;
the intended cropped area because of weak beneficiary participation, resulting&#13;
in poor cost recovery for repair and maintenance. By contrast those in West&#13;
Bengal succeeded after they were handed over to farmer groups.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.27      The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's Country&#13;
Assistance StrateQv (CAS) for India presented to the Executive Directors on&#13;
May 12, 1994. Among other aspects, the CAS emphasizes providing direct&#13;
support for specific reforms through policy-based investment operations at the&#13;
sectoral, state, and economy-wide levels. As demonstrated during the last two&#13;
years, the Bank is uniquely placed to carry out a dialogue on policy reform&#13;
with the GOI and state governments and support implementation of a reform&#13;
program.&#13;
1.28      The strategy places increased importance on private sector&#13;
initiative and responsibility. It involves:&#13;
(a) encouraging the private sector to supply goods and services that&#13;
now are provided exclusively by the public sector;&#13;
(b) introducing beneficiary participation in the design, operation and&#13;
maintenance, and financing and ownership of the assets created by&#13;
the investment; and&#13;
(c) effecting cost recovery for publicly supplied goods and services to&#13;
ensure accountability and sustained maintenance of assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
1.29      Given the high incidence of poverty in the eastern states of India.&#13;
including Assam. there is need to redirect Bank assistance to these areas&#13;
where the marginal productivity of investment is high in order to create&#13;
regional balance and assist in the alleviation of poverty. The emphasis is on&#13;
balancing appropriate targeting and delivery of production support services to&#13;
increase the agricultural production of the poor on the one hand and efficient&#13;
resource allocation and a reduced role for the public sector on the other.&#13;
The GOA and the World Food Programme, participating NGOs, and other local&#13;
institutions have successfully implemented small-scale development activities&#13;
in food production and rural infrastructure in selected poor communities (see&#13;
para 1.20). The Bank can play a unique role in assisting the GOA to expand&#13;
these successful pilot projects.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Origin and Concept&#13;
2.1       The GOA approached the Bank for assistance in its ongoing&#13;
development efforts designed to accelerate agricultural growth and alleviate&#13;
poverty in rural areas. The rural poor have low incomes, high maternal and&#13;
child mortality rates, poor nutrition, low female literacy, low unskilled&#13;
labor wages, and high risks of food security. The poor communities in Assam&#13;
have limited access to assets, including land, as well as underdeveloped&#13;
infrastructure and supporting services, compounding the poverty syndrome.&#13;
2.2       The project has been designed to target its benefits to the poorest&#13;
rural populations. It would offer better employment opportunities to poorer&#13;
farmers, and particularly to women, to improve their incomes and nutrition.&#13;
An attempt would be made to balance the GOA's policy reform objectives with&#13;
poverty alleviation goals through careful targeting of beneficiaries. The&#13;
project also incorporates specific measures to ensure beneficiaries'&#13;
participation in the selection and location of activities supported under the&#13;
project (para 3.4 to 3.8).&#13;
Project Obiectives&#13;
2.3       The primary objectives of the project would be to (a) improve&#13;
equity and alleviate poverty by offering better opportunities for poorer&#13;
farmers and women to contribute to agricultural growth and income generation;&#13;
(b) improve the nutrition of the rural poor; (c) accelerate agricultural&#13;
growth through improved use of resources, relieving infrastructural and&#13;
technical constraints, and providing an enabling environment to facilitate the&#13;
growth of private sector investments; (d) encourage sustainability of resource&#13;
use and quality of the environment; and (e) strengthen the agricultural policy&#13;
framework and improve the GOA's long-term capacity for strategic agricultural&#13;
planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
Project Description&#13;
2.4       The project is intended to benefit the poorest segments of the&#13;
rural population (para 2.2). To achieve this objective, the project would&#13;
support: (a) the Department of Agriculture's work program, including the&#13;
extension services for horticulture, fisheries, and livestock to poor rural&#13;
communities aimed at increasing their production; (b) institutional&#13;
development (technology generation and extension, seed multiplication and land&#13;
administration, and planning and coordination); and (c) rural infrastructure&#13;
(small scale irrigation and rural roads). Project components would also&#13;
include a number of studies considered necessary for improving the use of&#13;
natural resources (soil and water management) and the marketing of highly&#13;
perishable horticultural products. The proposed project would be implemented&#13;
in eight years starting in 1995/96 and would include a package of state-&#13;
specific policy reforms agreed to by the Bank and formally approved by the&#13;
GOA.&#13;
2.5       Project Area.  Although the project would cover the poor farming&#13;
communities in the entire state (23 districts), the intensity of activities in&#13;
each district would depend on the existing production potential. It would&#13;
provide specific investment support to meet the high-priority needs of these&#13;
communities. The development blocks to be covered by the project in each&#13;
district are shown in Annex 12. Indigenous people (scheduled tribes and&#13;
scheduled castes) form about 18% of the plains population (in 21 of 23&#13;
districts) and are scattered over the entire state. The tribal population in&#13;
rural areas, which is engaged in agriculture and practices farming systems&#13;
similar to those of its neighbors, is among the beneficiaries of the project.&#13;
Two hill districts are predominantly tribal areas with a separate&#13;
administrative arrangement supported by the central government. Because of&#13;
the special nature of the hill districts in the state, the project would limit&#13;
its coverage to activities of highest potential, such as fruit production.&#13;
Under these circumstances, the proiect does not need a separate development&#13;
plan for the tribals.&#13;
2.6       Targeting of Low-Income Beneficiaries.  Project activities would be&#13;
targeted to selected farming communities according to agreed criteria&#13;
including accessibility of markets, availability of rural roads, and delivery&#13;
of inputs supplies. Within these communities, the project would target about&#13;
300,000 rural households cultivating about 49,000 hectares. Preference would&#13;
be given to households with limited resources, including small land holdings,&#13;
low incomes (below the poverty line), and poor access to clean water (see para&#13;
3.28; Annex 3, Attachment 3; Annex 8; and Annex 9). The project would assist&#13;
poor households, especially women cultivators and heads of households, in&#13;
acquiring access to water, employment, and improved nutrition within their&#13;
communities. The GOA through the baseline surveys would identify the target&#13;
group of the poorest in the rural area for project activities. Other rural&#13;
households and communities would benefit from the improvement and&#13;
rehabilitation of rural roads and agricultural services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9-&#13;
2.7       Proposed Reform Proqram.  During project preparation, a review of&#13;
the state budget revealed that recurrent expenditure in agriculture is&#13;
displacing investment and thereby adversely affecting agricultural growth.&#13;
The GOA in preparing its agricultural development strategy analyzed these&#13;
issues (see para 1.19). The strategy includes (a) reduction of public sector&#13;
delivery of production inputs and services, (b) introduction of cost recovery&#13;
where possible and reduction of subsidies, (c) diversification of farming&#13;
toward products in which the state has comparative advantage, (d)&#13;
liberalization of state trade policy, (e) preparation and implementation of&#13;
demand-driven agricultural research programs, and (f) introduction of policy&#13;
incentives to promote private sector involvement in agriculture.&#13;
2.8       To implement the above strategy, GOA has formulated a policy action&#13;
matrix (Annex 2). Under the plan, GOA would:&#13;
(a) encourage private and cooperative sector investment in fisheries&#13;
development by extending lease periods for water bodies from three&#13;
to 7 years by issuing related government orders during 1996;&#13;
(b) issue government orders by the end of 1996 to invite private sector&#13;
companies and individuals to operate and manage foundation and&#13;
certified seed multiplication farms and horticultural nurseries&#13;
currently run by the Agriculture Department and public agencies;&#13;
(c) prepare a five-year plan by the end of 1996 to phase out GOA&#13;
subsidies on agricultural inputs, except those for tribals and&#13;
scheduled castes covered by special programs;&#13;
(d) phase out subsidies for farm machinery hire service offered by the&#13;
Engineering Wing of the Department of Agriculture to encourage&#13;
private sector involvement by the end of 1996;&#13;
(e) initiate implementation of the Irrigation Act of 1992 in 1996,&#13;
according to an agreed plan that would allow full cost recovery of&#13;
water from beneficiaries, including the cost of electricity for&#13;
public deep tube wells and lift irrigation schemes;&#13;
(f) during 1996, issue a government order to facilitate transfer of new&#13;
and rehabilitated irrigation schemes under the project to&#13;
beneficiaries;&#13;
(g) prepare during 1996 a schedule for phasing out non-viable public&#13;
sector enterprises in agriculture; and&#13;
(h) during 1996, assign responsibility for fisheries policy development&#13;
to the Department of Fisheries to include all public water bodies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
2.9       Reforms Already Implemented.  During project processing, the GOA&#13;
had taken early actions toward implementation of selected policy reforms&#13;
recommended under the project. It had:&#13;
(a)  extended lease periods of water bodies from three to five years to&#13;
attract private sector involvement in fisheries development;&#13;
(b)  increased farm machinery hire charges from Rs 286 to Rs 372 per&#13;
hectare per day (reducing the subsidy by 30%);&#13;
(c)  increased water charges from Rs 80 to Rs 140 per hectare during&#13;
kharif;&#13;
(d)  identified unprofitable public sector corporations in the&#13;
agricultural sector to be wound-up; and&#13;
(e)  prepared an annual work program and budget for FY96, which includes&#13;
specific reduction of subsidies on fertilizers and seeds.&#13;
2.10      During project implementation, the GOA would submit the state&#13;
agricultural budget and work program to the Bank on an annual basis reflecting&#13;
policy adjustment. The Bank would review the documents and assist the GOA to&#13;
rationalize and reverse the current trend in public expenditure. During&#13;
negotiations the GOA confirmed its commitment to imnlement the above Dolicy&#13;
reforms (vara 2.8).&#13;
Detailed Features of Investment Proposals&#13;
Poverty Alleviation (US$24.1 million, or 19% of the base cost).&#13;
2.11      The project would support the GOA annual agricultural program which&#13;
is directed to alleviate poverty and improve services to rural communities in&#13;
23 districts. The priority areas would include the development of (a)&#13;
fisheries, (b) horticulture, and (c) livestock. The project would support&#13;
implementation of these activities according to agreed formula for capital&#13;
cost sharing with beneficiaries, outlined in the cost recovery section (see&#13;
paras 4.24 to 4.26).&#13;
(a)  Fisheries Development.  To tap the existing potential for fish&#13;
production in Assam (Annex 1, para 15), the project would include&#13;
three main activities:&#13;
(i)  Fish Production.  Support for the development of farm ponds&#13;
(800 ponds of average size of 0.25 ha each), community tanks&#13;
(150 tanks of average size of 2 ha each), and large beele (SO&#13;
beels of average size of 100 ha each). The beels would be&#13;
constructed and seeded at an average cost of Rs 13,000 per&#13;
hectare and leased out to the highest private bidders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
(ii) Fish Support Services. Support needed to (a) establish six&#13;
fish health units and a mini-mill for testing and development&#13;
of feed; (b) strengthen extension service (e.g., providing&#13;
training to fish subject matter specialists to supplement the&#13;
broad-based extension service, para 2.14 (c)); and (c) carry&#13;
out demonstration of integrated fish farming system with&#13;
horticulture and animal husbandry.&#13;
(iii)  Monitoring and Evaluation. Support to investigate problems&#13;
affecting floodplain fisheries, carry out a systematic&#13;
ecological survey of the wetlands, monitor implementation of&#13;
fisheries development activities, and evaluate the impact of&#13;
the project on rural incomes and on the environment.&#13;
(b) Horticulture. To alleviate some of the constraints affecting the&#13;
development of high-value crops (see Annex 1, para 16), the project&#13;
would:&#13;
(i)  strengthen 23 progeny orchards;&#13;
(ii) train subject matter specialists for extension service; and&#13;
(iii)  establish demonstration plots on selected farmers' fields by&#13;
providing improved horticultural planting material.&#13;
Only progeny orchards that would be leased to private entrepreneurs&#13;
would be rehabilitated. Detailed review of their performance and&#13;
potential for improvement would be undertaken to attract interested&#13;
private entrepreneurs. The objective would be to promote private&#13;
production of horticultural seed and seedlings.&#13;
(c)  Livestock Development.  To complement the GOA's ongoing effort to&#13;
improve livestock productivity (see Annex 1, para 17), the project&#13;
would:&#13;
(i)  support an artificial insemination (AI) program by extending&#13;
coverage of the cattle upgrading program through establishment&#13;
of three frozen semen production stations, creating six "frozen&#13;
semen banks," rehabilitating existing liquid nitrogen plants,&#13;
and extending coverage of AI to the poor districts;&#13;
(ii) strengthen disease diagnostic and investigation laboratories&#13;
and disease monitoring;&#13;
(iii)  refurbish and modify Livestock Husbandry Department buildings&#13;
for training and procure equipment and training material;&#13;
(iv) train self-employed livestock technicians (veterinarians,&#13;
breeders, and "lay inseminators");&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
(v) train subject matter specialists in basic aspects of animal&#13;
husbandry and management; and&#13;
(vi) support forage seeds production by the private sector through&#13;
contracts and forage production by NGOs and field management&#13;
committees (FMCs).&#13;
Institutional DeveloDment (US$23.1 million, or 19t of base cost).&#13;
2.12      The success of the project in alleviating poverty would depend on&#13;
the capacity of the institutions involved to generate and transfer&#13;
agricultural technology efficiently, especially in the priority production&#13;
areas supported by the project (horticulture, fisheries, and livestock).&#13;
Because about 70% of the area is flood-prone during the monsoon season,&#13;
availability of adaptive technology to these conditions will be especially&#13;
important.&#13;
2.13      Furthermore, because of the small size of farms, increased&#13;
diversification and efficiency of production from land becomes crucial to the&#13;
survival of the household. The project would support improvement of&#13;
integrated technology generation and transfer to cover crop, livestock, and&#13;
fish production and land use efficiency for both irrigated and rainfed&#13;
farming.&#13;
2.14      Specifically, the project covers (a) technology generation, (b)&#13;
education and training, (c) extension service, (d) seed multiplication, and&#13;
(a) land administration.&#13;
(a) Technoloov Generation. The project would:&#13;
(i) strengthen the state-level applied research in six regional&#13;
agricultural research stations under the Assam Agricultural&#13;
University, namely, Titabar, Shillongani, Karimganj, Lakhimpur,&#13;
Gossaigaon, and Diphu;&#13;
(ii) strengthen the livestock research center at Mandira and the&#13;
horticultural research center at Kahikuchi, and establish a new&#13;
fisheries research center at Jorhat; and&#13;
(iii) establish a pilot project on soil and water conservation and&#13;
management and treat about 5,400 hectares of land, which would&#13;
serve as demonstrations.&#13;
(b)  Education and Trainina.  Assam Agricultural University is&#13;
responsible for education and training of pre-service staff. The&#13;
objective of the subcomponent is to increase the representation of&#13;
women in the extension service. Facilities for farmer training&#13;
would also be provided at five sites (selected, surveyed, and ready&#13;
to build). To accomplish the objective, the project would:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
(i)  support pre-service training for women by refurbishing the Gram&#13;
Sevika Training Center at Jorhat;&#13;
(ii)  strengthen the ability of the Assam agricultural university to&#13;
provide in-service training to extension staff;&#13;
(iii)  support farmers' training; and&#13;
(iv)  upgrade the training facility at Naltoli to function as a&#13;
state-level staff training institute.&#13;
(c)  Extension.  Under the proposed project, coverage of a broad based&#13;
extension service would be expanded to include high-value crops,&#13;
fisheries, and livestock, as well as introduce reforms aimed at&#13;
addressing recognized limitations of the current T&amp;V system and&#13;
associated problems. The strategy would be to (i) strengthen the&#13;
role of the contact farmer and group approaches through stronger&#13;
links with FMCs and NGOs, (ii) use local mass media (both print and&#13;
electronic), (iii) develop extension materials for women farmers,&#13;
and (iv) expand the participation of field staff and NGOs in the&#13;
design and implementation of the extension strategy, which&#13;
addresses both production targets and efficient management of land&#13;
and water resources. Watershed development and soil and water&#13;
management would receive special emphasis. To achieve the above&#13;
strategy, the project would:&#13;
(i)  extend coverage of the expanded extension service to all&#13;
agricultural subdivisions, including eight additional&#13;
subdivisions, and provide vehicles for the Agricultural&#13;
Department and for extension staff on a hire-purchase&#13;
arrangement;&#13;
(ii)  support Field Trial Stations, to include trials and&#13;
demonstration of production technologies (farm power and&#13;
harvesting) on farmers' fields, and postharvest technology&#13;
(crop drying and storage);&#13;
(iii)  strengthen provision of information to extension staff by&#13;
supplying equipment (including an offset printing facility),&#13;
and materials.&#13;
(d)  Seed MultiDlication.  A seed production plan prepared by the GOA&#13;
identified the state's need for breeder, foundation and certified&#13;
seed. To assist Assam in implementing the above plan more&#13;
efficiently, limited support would be provided to the public sector&#13;
(Assam Agricultural University) to produce breeder seed.&#13;
Facilities for processing and maintaining seed would be provided.&#13;
The project would also provide improvements (fencing, farm&#13;
machinery and equipment, repair of farm buildings, provision of&#13;
irrigation water) on government foundation and certified seed farms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
to be leased to the private sector, the full cost of which would be&#13;
recovered from the new lease holders.&#13;
(e)  Land Administration.  In Assam, pressure on land is high.  More&#13;
than 60% of the state's land holders own less than one hectare of&#13;
highly fragmented land. With such small land holdings, long-term&#13;
investment, such as improved irrigation and drainage, which is&#13;
critical for increasing crop yields and diversification to high-&#13;
value crops, is limited. The project would introduce better&#13;
integrated land use planning and improve land management operations&#13;
by supporting cadastral surveys and computerizing land records in&#13;
two districts, and consolidating fragmented land holdings in 15&#13;
villages of four revenue circles of Kamrup District. The pilot&#13;
project would be implemented over three years and would ultimately&#13;
cover about 10,000 land holders on an estimated cultivable land&#13;
area of 2,400 hectares.&#13;
Infrastructure DeveloDment (US$74.7 million, or 60% of base cost).&#13;
2.15      Poorly developed infrastructure is an impediment to the economic&#13;
development of the state (Annex 1, para 1-11; on irrigation and roads). The&#13;
project would support specific improvements in irrigation and rural roads.&#13;
(a) Irrigation. The project would target a ground water development&#13;
effort to the poor communities. To accomplish the strategy, the&#13;
project would:&#13;
(i) construct 15,000 shallow tube wells (STWs) covering 33,000 ha;&#13;
(ii) rehabilitate 320 deep tube wells (DTws) and provide combination&#13;
pump sets (both electric and diesel pump) to about 8% of the&#13;
wells, and rehabilitate 150 river pumping schemes, for a total&#13;
irrigation capacity of about 15,500 ha;&#13;
(iii) construct five irrigation tanks as a pilot scheme to irrigate&#13;
about 100 ha;&#13;
(iv) assist in establishing farmer groups (field management&#13;
committees and water user associations) and train farmers in&#13;
the proper operation and maintenance of the irrigation&#13;
schemes through NGOs as promoters and organizers of farmers&#13;
groups; and&#13;
(v) provide training to project staff.&#13;
The project would support implementation of the irrigation&#13;
activities according to an agreed formula for capital cost sharing&#13;
with beneficiaries, outlined in the cost recovery section (see para&#13;
4.24 to 4.26).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
(b)  Rural Roads.  It is estimated that more than 17,000 kilometers of&#13;
rural roads in Assam are in need of improvement. However, the high&#13;
cost of road construction, currently estimated at Rs 1.5 to 2.0&#13;
million per kilometer, mainly due to high royalty payments for&#13;
construction material, would limit the support to a small, well-&#13;
defined network of rural roads in six districts (Lakhimpur,&#13;
Nagaong, Sibsagar, Kamrup, Darrang, and Cachar). The project would&#13;
cover:&#13;
(i)  rehabilitation of about 1,400 km of rural roads, including&#13;
replacement of 282 unserviceable timber bridges;&#13;
(ii) provision of spare parts for heavy road construction equipment&#13;
under the Public Works Department (PWD);&#13;
(iii)  provision of consultant services to prepare road and bridge&#13;
designs, specifications, drawings, and bidding documents and to&#13;
supervise construction by private contractors;&#13;
(iv) modernization of the PWD's laboratory and design, mechanical&#13;
and road maintenance wings;&#13;
(v)  support for rural road maintenance; and&#13;
(vi) training of PWD personnel in project and contract management,&#13;
quality control, road maintenance, and labor-intensive&#13;
construction.&#13;
The selection of roads has taken into account areas of agricultural&#13;
potential, traffic growth projections, need to improve the existing&#13;
coimmunications system between villages and markets, and the extent&#13;
to which land acquisition and negative environmental effects can be&#13;
avoided. The selection was based on agreed criteria for ranking&#13;
roads incorporating the above factors, developed jointly by the PWD&#13;
and the IDA through consultation with rural communities and NGOs&#13;
(Annex 3, Attachment 3). Although support for road repair and&#13;
maintenance is provided under the proiect. preparation of a road&#13;
maintenance policy. financing arrangements, and imnlementation plan&#13;
satisfactory to the Association is a condition of disbursement of&#13;
Credit funds for road maintenance.&#13;
Prolect Implementation (US$2.2 million, or 2% of base cost).&#13;
2.16      Because of the multisectoral nature of the activities supported&#13;
under the project, assistance would be provided to create in-house capacity&#13;
for project implementation. GOA would establish a Project Implementation Unit&#13;
(PIU), and funds under the project would finance vehicles, office equipment,&#13;
incremental operation and maintenance, and minimal incremental staff to plan,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
design, supervise, monitor and evaluate project activities. Studies on soils&#13;
and water management and marketing of high-value crops would also be financed&#13;
under the project (Annex 4, Attachments 1 and 2).&#13;
Proiect Costs and Financing&#13;
2.17      Total project costs including physical and price contingencies are&#13;
estimated at Rs 5,676.5 million (US$146.6 million), of which US$10.1 million,&#13;
or 8.0% of base costs, would be in foreign exchange. Investment costs and&#13;
recurrent costs amount to 77% and 23% of base costs, respectively. The&#13;
breakdown of costs by component is shown at Annex 5 and is summarized below.&#13;
Project costs are based on actual July 1994 prices and include physical&#13;
contingencies of US$13.4 million (about 11.0% of total base costs) and price&#13;
contingencies totaling US$9.2 million (7.0% of base costs) that are based on&#13;
the following projected annual inflation rates. Local inflation rates for&#13;
1994, 1995, and 1996 are projected to be 9.5%, 8.0%, and 7.0%. The local&#13;
inflation rate for each of the remaining years of the project is projected to&#13;
be 6%. Regarding external inflation, annual rates of 3.0%, 1.5%, 1.8%, and&#13;
2.6% for 1994 to 1997, respectively, and 2.5% annually thereafter through 2001&#13;
(which are consistent with the Bank's latest projections issued October 1994)&#13;
were assumed in estimating project costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
2.18      Identifiable duties and taxes would amount to Rs 276.8 million&#13;
(US$7.3 million). Total project cost, net of duties and taxes, would be&#13;
US$139.3 million.&#13;

2.19      The proposed IDA credit of SDR 81.0 million (US$126.0 million&#13;
equivalent) would finance 90% of total project costs, net of duties and taxes,&#13;
or 86% of total costs including taxes, and all foreign exchange costs.&#13;
The credit would be made to the GOI on standard terms and conditions, and the&#13;
GOl would on-lend credit proceeds to the GOA on its prevailing terms and&#13;
arrangements. The State's contribution and that of the beneficiaries of&#13;
project activities, amounting to US$20.6 million would be included in the&#13;
GOA's annual budgetary allocations. Funds for implementing individual&#13;
activities would be channeled to implementing line departments and agencies,&#13;
and Project Implementation Unit. These funds would be available for&#13;
reallocation among components depending on the success in implementing a&#13;
particular component or the need for inclusion of any new activities within&#13;
the general project objective and area. This arrangement would encourage&#13;
participating line departments and agencies to complete their targets ahead of&#13;
schedule and increase their activities, particularly since the potential for&#13;
such expansion exists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
2.20      To participate effectively, beneficiaries would contribute labor or&#13;
cash needed for construction of fish ponds, community fish tanks, and&#13;
irrigation schemes and for their operation and maintenance. Beneficiaries&#13;
also would construct and maintain village link roads.&#13;
2.21      Incremental costs for sustaining activities and facilities&#13;
established under the project following its completion would be met by&#13;
beneficiaries through collection of charges from user groups. The State&#13;
government's budgetary support would be limited to extension service, rural&#13;
road repair and maintenance, and incremental recurrent costs for activities&#13;
undertaken by Assam Agricultural University.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
2.22      Works consist of construction and rehabilitation of shallow tube&#13;
wells, tanks, deep tube wells, and river pumping schemes for irrigation;&#13;
construction of fish ponds, community fish tanks, and large fish beels; and&#13;
construction of rural roads and buildings, and repair and maintenance of rural&#13;
roads. Because these works are small and scattered throughout the state, they&#13;
would not attract foreign bidders. These works would therefore be procured&#13;
using national competitive bidding (NCB) and force account procedures&#13;
including beneficiaries' in-kind contribution in the form of labor.&#13;
(a) NCB would be used in respect of works valued in aggregate US$67.0&#13;
M. The works would be grouped into convenient packages for bidding&#13;
of at least US$400,000. Necessary land would be acquired prior to&#13;
bidding. Contracts would be issued using procedures satisfactory&#13;
to the Association; and&#13;
(b) Force account up to an aggregate value of US$10.6 M of which US$8.0&#13;
M for road repair and maintenance, would be followed for all small&#13;
works in remote areas valued at US$10,000 and below, particularly&#13;
in respect of construction of fish ponds and shallow tube wells,&#13;
and rehabilitation of small irrigation schemes; construction of&#13;
buildings; and repair and maintenance of roads.&#13;
2.23      Goods consist of vehicles, machinery, tools, equipment, furniture,&#13;
construction materials, and agricultural materials and livestock. The&#13;
project would fund about 320 vehicles, 260 motorcycles, machinery, tools,&#13;
equipment, furniture, and construction materials valued in aggregate at&#13;
US$20.0 M. These would be grouped into packages costing over US$200,000 to be&#13;
procured following ICB procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Small items of&#13;
machinery, tools, equipment, and furniture costing less than US$20,000 per&#13;
package up to an aggregate value of US$2.0 M would be procured following local&#13;
shopping procedures after comparing price quotations obtained from at least&#13;
three suppliers. Construction materials required for force account works up&#13;
to an aggregate value of US$0.9 M would be procured following local shopping&#13;
procedures. Agricultural materials and livestock (seed, seedlings,&#13;
fertilizer, breeding stock) for agricultural development activities would have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
a total value of US$7.0 M; purchases of small quantities for use throughout&#13;
the project area would be procured using direct purchase procedures&#13;
satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
2.24      Consultancies and training consist of policy support (US$0.5&#13;
million), implementation support (US$4.3 million), and capacity building&#13;
(US$5.2 million) covering technical assistance, NGO services and training.&#13;
Technical assistance and NGO services would be contracted on terms and&#13;
conditions in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for use of consultants.&#13;
Training would be procured using GOA procedures satisfactory to the&#13;
Association.&#13;
2.25      Incremental oDeratinQ costs  consist of materials and labor&#13;
required for operation and/or maintenance of project vehicles, equipment and&#13;
machinery, buildings and office supplies, and incremental salaries and wages&#13;
all equivalent to US$29.1 M. Expenditures for these items would be made by&#13;
the GOA using financial and administrative procedures satisfactory to the&#13;
Association.&#13;
2.26      The following contracts would be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review: all NCB contracts including works valued over US$200,000, goods valued&#13;
over US$100,000, consultancies with firms exceeding US$100,000, and&#13;
consultancies with individuals exceeding US$50,000. All other contracts would&#13;
be subject to selective post-review by visiting Bank missions.&#13;

2.28      Disbursements under the credit would cover 90% of total project&#13;
costs net of taxes and duties, including the following:&#13;
(a) 100% of expenditure on consultancies;&#13;
(b) 90% of expenditure on works; and&#13;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditure, or 100% of ex-factory costs, or 80% of&#13;
costs of goods, if purchased locally.&#13;
2.29      Expenditure on incremental operating costs would be on a declining&#13;
basis as follows: 70% until March 31, 1996, 50% until March 31, 1998, and 20%&#13;
thereafter (including vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance,&#13;
agricultural materials, office supplies, incremental salaries, and wages and&#13;
utilities).&#13;
2.30      Full documentation would be provided for disbursements for&#13;
expenditures for vehicles, equipment, and furniture under contracts exceeding&#13;
US$100,000; for works under contracts exceeding US$200,000; and for&#13;
consultants and training under contracts exceeding US$100,000 (US$50,000 for&#13;
individual consultants). For all other expenditures, IDA would disburse&#13;
against statements of expenditure (SOE) in an agreed format. Supporting&#13;
documents for SOEs would be available for inspection by supervision missions&#13;
and auditors, and retained by implementing agencies for one year after Bank&#13;
receipt of the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal&#13;
from the credit account was made. Based on the credit disbursement profile&#13;
for Bank-assisted agricultural projects in India, the credit under the project&#13;
would be disbursed over eight years from July 1995 to June 2003 (Annex 6).&#13;
Project completion is June 30, 2003 and credit closing is December 31, 2003.&#13;
Retroactive FinancinQ and Special Account&#13;
2.31      To expedite project start-up, IDA would retroactively finance&#13;
project expenditures incurred after appraisal (November 1, 1994) up to a limit&#13;
of SDR 3.9 M (US$6.0 M equivalent), provided IDA procurement procedures and&#13;
guidelines were followed. These expenditures would include procurement of&#13;
vehicles and equipment, consultant services and workshops for training, and&#13;
other start-up activities. To facilitate timely payment of project&#13;
expenditures, a Special Account amounting to an equivalent of US$4.0 million&#13;
(equal to three months' average disbursements) would be established at the&#13;
Reserve Bank of India.&#13;
Accounts and Audit&#13;
2.32      Separate records and accounts would be maintained by each&#13;
participating entity. The accounts would identify all project expenditure&#13;
transactions on an ongoing basis, including contributions from the GOA, the&#13;
GOI, and the credit.   Supporting documentation would be retained for review&#13;
by Bank supervision missions. To ensure proper maintenance of records and&#13;
accounts, an accounts officer would be recruited in the Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) to assist staff of individual line departments and agencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
implementing project activities in complying with standard government control&#13;
and auditing procedures. The Accounts officer would also be responsible for&#13;
preparing PIU accounts, conducting internal audits of all project activities&#13;
being implemented by line departments, and performing technical audits of the&#13;
special account on a regular basis in collaboration with economists in the PIU&#13;
and outside experts. Technical audits would be financed with project funds.&#13;
The special account would be audited annually, and the audited statements and&#13;
the auditor's report would be submitted to IDA.&#13;
2.33      The GOA auditing arrangements would continue, and an audit in&#13;
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and auditing&#13;
standards would be made. AQreement was obtained at necqotiations that GOA&#13;
would cause all imnlementinQ agencies to maintain separate accounts for&#13;
prolect expenditures, and that the PIU would consolidate prolect accounts and&#13;
send to the Association certified coDies of the audited accounts and SOEs for&#13;
the project not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Management Approach&#13;
3.1       The state agriculture strategy (para 1.19) and policy action matrix&#13;
(para 2.8) would provide direction to project management activities. However,&#13;
the strategy and the policy would be reviewed and revised regularly to ensure&#13;
that basic objectives are achieved for accelerating agricultural development,&#13;
public funds are used judiciously, and natural resources are maintained. The&#13;
state annual budget would be revised to reflect the policy reforms and&#13;
institutional adjustments being proposed under the project.&#13;
3.2       Senior policy-makers of the state supported by NGO representatives&#13;
would guide project management. The participating line departments would&#13;
implement project field activities, which the agricultural production&#13;
commissioner (APC) would coordinate at the state level. Support for&#13;
incremental staffing would be provided where necessary. The aim of the&#13;
project would be to improve staff competence at all levels through project&#13;
supported training programs. Systems aimed at improving the quality and&#13;
effectiveness of the public services would also be established with emphasis&#13;
on quality improvement and cost effectiveness.&#13;
3.3       At the grassroots level, participation of beneficiaries,&#13;
particularly women, NGOs, and farmers organizations, would be actively&#13;
promoted. To the extent possible, the project also would aim at transferring&#13;
or leasing production assets to the care and management of the local&#13;
beneficiary groups. Involvement of the GOA in activities better suited for&#13;
the private sector would be avoided. To achieve thi.s objective the GOA would&#13;
create an economic environment conducive to the promotion of the private&#13;
sector in agriculture through policy adjustment as reflected in the policy&#13;
reform matrix.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
Beneficiary and NGO Participation&#13;
3.4       The project would promote beneficiary participation in the&#13;
selection, location, design, and implementation of project activities. Local&#13;
beneficiary groups, especially Field Management Committees (FMCs), selected&#13;
NGOs, and Water User Associations (WUAs) would be responsible for field-level&#13;
implementation of project components. Operation and maintenance of common&#13;
assets established by the project would be vested with FMCs and WUAs. A&#13;
similar approach followed in the Bank-supported Bihar Plateau Development&#13;
Project (Cr. 2439-IN) was successful in involving local people in establishing&#13;
and maintaining rural assets. Also, several states in India (Haryana, West&#13;
Bengal, Maharashtra) have with the support of the Bank, established&#13;
sustainable models for WUAs, especially in minor irrigation and tube wells.&#13;
The recently issued ICR for West Bengal Minor Irrigation Project (Cr. 1619-IN)&#13;
documents the successful experience of WUA in project implementation.&#13;
3.5       FMCs are nonpolitical, village-based voluntary social groups&#13;
working for the welfare and economic growth of the village communities. The&#13;
DOA has actively promoted the formation of FMCs to accelerate agricultural&#13;
growth. About 18,000 FMCs have been established throughout the state. Some&#13;
1,000 FMCs are self-supporting, and the rest are in various stages of&#13;
development.&#13;
3.6       FMCs have successfully managed the village common assets&#13;
established with support from the World Food Program and local NGOs (e.g.,&#13;
fish ponds, surface irrigation schemes and ground water facilities), built&#13;
small-scale enterprises, and reinvested the revenue generated from these&#13;
activities for common services such as education, WID programs, and short-term&#13;
credit programs for the needy poor. FMCs are also active in promoting the&#13;
introduction of high-yielding varieties and new, high-value crops, in&#13;
encouraging livestock and sericulture development, and in organizing input&#13;
delivery and marketing services. WUAs have been established to manage small-&#13;
scale irrigation, but the Assam experience with WUAs is limited. Further&#13;
expansion under the project would require careful monitoring and technical&#13;
assistance specialized in these services.&#13;
3.7       Under the project, NGOs would serve as partners responsible for&#13;
mobilizing rural people for group action and upgrading skills of FMC leaders.&#13;
About 20 NGOs are currently active in the state. NGO involvement in&#13;
developmental activities is relatively new in Assam, but it is steadily&#13;
growing. In earlier years, NGOs focused primarily on nonfarm employment&#13;
opportunities and social welfare programs. Specialized NGOs are interested in&#13;
participating in agriculture, animal husbandry, and allied activities.&#13;
Information on NGOs in Assam, their activities, and their proposed involvement&#13;
in this project is in Annex 8.&#13;
3.8       To enhance the effectiveness of the local institutions, the GOA&#13;
would empower registered beneficiary groups to collect 1i of the construction&#13;
and operation and maintenance cost of the facilities from beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
During project implementation, the GOA would organize workshops for&#13;
beneficiaries and NGOs. Agreement was obtained at neqotiations that GOA would&#13;
contract NGOs selected accordinQ to criteria aQreed with IDA (Annex 8.&#13;
Attachment 4).&#13;
Proiect Orcranization and Manaaement&#13;
3.9       Being multisectoral, the project would be implemented by a number&#13;
of departments and agencies. The agricultural production commissioner (APC)&#13;
would coordinate and guide these departments and agencies in implementing&#13;
project activities (Annex 7). Each implementing department or agency would&#13;
identify one officer who would be responsible for coordinating all its&#13;
activities under the project. To assist the APC, a Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) headed by a director and supported by two economists, an&#13;
environmentalist, an anthropologist and an accounts officer would be&#13;
established and supported under the project. Acreement was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that GOA would maintain a Project ImDlementation Unit with&#13;
staffinc and responsibilities acreed with the Association.&#13;
3.10      The PIU would include an NGO and environment cell to coordinate&#13;
beneficiary participation and carry out environmental screening of project&#13;
activities. The PIU would be responsible for planning and monitoring&#13;
implementation of project activities and for supervising and evaluating&#13;
performance both directly and through consultant input.&#13;
3.11      To assist in implementation, two committees would be established at&#13;
the state level. The Project Guidance Committee (PGC) would be headed by the&#13;
chief secretary of the state; the APC would serve as secretary to PGC. Other&#13;
senior secretaries in the government and four NGO representatives would serve&#13;
as members. This committee would approve the project annual work plan (para&#13;
3.15) and budget, and address policy-related issues. The Project Coordination&#13;
Committee (PCC), would include the APC as the committee chairperson, the&#13;
Project Director as its secretary, heads of implementing departments and&#13;
agencies, the additional secretary (Finance) of the Mini-Secretariat, and&#13;
representatives of NGOs and user group as members. The Project Coordination&#13;
Committee would review annual work plans and associated expenditures in the&#13;
budget prepared by PIU prior to submission to the Project Guidance Committee&#13;
for approval. It would periodically, assess project performance and offer&#13;
suggestions for improvement. AQreement was obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
GOA would maintain the Prolect Guidance Committee and the Prolect Coordination&#13;
Committee with membershiD and resDonsibilities agreed with the Association.&#13;
3.12     Implementation of individual activities under the three main&#13;
components would be undertaken by the respective line departments, the&#13;
district and block development administration, and the state agricultural&#13;
university (Annex 13). NGOs and beneficiaries would also participate in&#13;
project implementation. Overall coordination of implementation would be the&#13;
responsibility of the project director. The project director's other&#13;
responsibilities would be: (a) reviewing and approving plans prepared by line&#13;
departments, (b) allocating funds, and (c) monitoring implementation of&#13;
approved plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
3.13      Because implementing departments have other responsibilities,&#13;
separate teams would be created in each line department at Guwahati&#13;
exclusively for implementing project activities. Each team would include (a)&#13;
the head of the department or agency (chairperson), (b) a senior officer in&#13;
the department (secretary), (c) two field-level managers nominated by the&#13;
department or agency head, and (d) representatives of two NGOs with&#13;
appropriate expertise or experience. Each team would meet periodically (at&#13;
least once every quarter) to review plans and field implementation problems&#13;
and advise the head of department on appropriate actions.&#13;
3.14      The deputy commissioners through their development wings in the&#13;
districts would coordinate and integrate all project activities in the&#13;
district and assist the APC and PD in planning and overseeing implementation.&#13;
The block development officers would perform a similar role at the block&#13;
level. At the district block and village levels, the District Planning and&#13;
Development Council, the panchayats samiti, and the village panchayats would&#13;
help the rural development administration in planning and implementing project&#13;
activities. These local institutions would be important contact points for&#13;
communicating with people about and sensitizing them to project activities.&#13;
3.15      The project is designed as a rolling program with annual work plans&#13;
phased in to cover all districts over the implementation period. It aims at&#13;
promoting integrated planning and coordinated implementation of the&#13;
subcomponents to secure maximum socioeconomic gains. Achieving implementation&#13;
efficiency, high quality of works, cost effectiveness, and NGO and beneficiary&#13;
involvement are some of the project's major themes.&#13;
3.16      The annual work plan would include:&#13;
(a)  implementation details and expenditures for project activities&#13;
during the year;&#13;
(b)  implementation plan and budget for project activities for the&#13;
following year;&#13;
(c)  arrangements for carrying out cadastral surveys, updating land&#13;
records, and encouraging existing local institutions (e.g., Field&#13;
Management Committees) to promote land consolidation on a pilot&#13;
scale;&#13;
(d)  arrangements for leasing irrigation schemes and fish production&#13;
tanks and transferring the responsibility for their operation and&#13;
maintenance to beneficiaries during the project period;&#13;
(e)  agenda for at least two workshops with NGOs to define their role in&#13;
the project and facilitate their involvement in implementing&#13;
project activities;&#13;
(f)  Memoranda of Agreement between implementing departments/agencies&#13;
and NGOs and FMCs, covering the selection, location, and design of&#13;
project activities in the implementation plan;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
(g) designs, drawings, specifications, and bidding documents for rural&#13;
roads proposed for construction during the year;&#13;
(h) arrangements for carrying out a systematic ecological survey of the&#13;
wetlands;&#13;
(i) a training program for staff of implementing line departments, an&#13;
appropriate monitoring system, arrangements for carrying out&#13;
economic and social surveys, and an annual report evaluating the&#13;
impact of the project; and&#13;
(j) background studies on ground water for those sites identified for&#13;
construction of new tube wells.&#13;
3.17      The annual work plan, procurement plan, and civil works plan, along&#13;
with the project legal documents, would serve as the main framework for&#13;
project implementation. Supervision of the project would be undertaken by&#13;
both the Bank and the GOI/MOA on a semi-annual basis. Agreement was obtained&#13;
at negotiations that the GOA would prepare and submit to IDA by the end of&#13;
March of each year. starting in 1996 annual work plans and budgets for the&#13;
proiect satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
3.18      To ensure that the Project Implementation Unit carries out its&#13;
planning and monitoring responsibilities adequately, competent persons would&#13;
be recruited to fill the two economist positions. The candidates would have&#13;
appropriate academic backgrounds, and field experience in project planning and&#13;
monitoring, and computer skills.   They would be contracted or deployed for&#13;
these positions on a fixed-term basis; their salaries and other personal&#13;
emoluments would be accommodated within the overall budgetary provisions.&#13;
3.19      The economists' primary responsibility would be to formulate and&#13;
finalize annual project plans in consultation with implementing line&#13;
departments and agencies, and to review and monitor implementation progress.&#13;
In addition, the economists would assess field training needs and organize&#13;
training for staff in project planning and management, and other courses as&#13;
the project director sees fit.&#13;
3.20      The environmentalist in the PIU would carry out environmental&#13;
assessment and amelioration activities. The expert would organize workshops&#13;
as forums for NGOs and others to deliberate on all aspects of the project,&#13;
with particular emphasis on the environment, and make recommendations to the&#13;
decision making committees proposed under the project. At these workshops,&#13;
NGO representatives would be elected to the various committees.&#13;
3.21      The Anthropologist in the PIU would coordinate NGO activities,&#13;
specifically reviewing investment proposals with respect to the participatory&#13;
process and social concerns; developing innovative proposals for possible&#13;
implementation under the project; standardizing the methodology, procedure,&#13;
and norms for major field activities, such as beneficiary organization; and&#13;
monitoring and evaluating NGO activities implemented with financial assistance&#13;
from the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
3.22      The environmentalist and the anthropologist would develop criteria&#13;
and operational procedures for screening project investment components for&#13;
environmental and social considerations, and put in place arrangements for&#13;
implementation of these procedures. The NGO and environment cell would also&#13;
develop and implement guidelines for monitoring activities throughout the&#13;
project (para 4.19). Investments under the project are not expected to&#13;
displace families from their lands. However, as a precaution, in unforeseen&#13;
situation if it becomes necessary, the GOA agreed at the negotiations to carry&#13;
out land acaruisition and resettlement and rehabilitation of any peonle&#13;
affected by the prolect in accordance with arrangements and procedures agreed&#13;
with the Association. Such arrangements and procedures are included in Annex&#13;
17.&#13;
Planning Procedure&#13;
3.23      The economists in the PIU would (a) formulate, in the third quarter&#13;
of each year, an annual work program for the succeeding year in consultation&#13;
with the heads of departments/agencies, deputy commissioners, and NGOs; and&#13;
(b) review implementation progress during the year, agree on the selection and&#13;
design criteria, and review monitoring and evaluation reports, other specific&#13;
studies, and NGO/beneficiary suggestions as the base for project planning.&#13;
All activities that might likely have an adverse impact on the environment&#13;
would be referred to and cleared by the responsible environmentalist at the&#13;
PIU.&#13;
3.24      Each draft annual plan would be referred to the appropriate zilla&#13;
parishads (local councils) for their views. The views of the zilla parishad&#13;
in the selection of activities and sites for works would be given due&#13;
consideration in finalizing an annual plan. Each final plan would then be&#13;
discussed by the Project Coordinating Committee and approved. The approved&#13;
plan would form the basis for budget preparation. Agreement was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the GOA would cause staff of implementing departments and&#13;
agencies to interact and agree with beneficiaries in the choice, location,&#13;
design, preparation, and implementation of activities supDorted under the&#13;
proiect.&#13;
3.25      Because the project would have funds for the identification of&#13;
project-related studies for implementation by consultants or&#13;
NGOs, the studies would be part of the annual plan, with agreed Terms of&#13;
Reference. These studies would be cleared by the Project Coordination&#13;
Committee and the Bank before implementation.&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
3.26      The project would have a separate budget "head" and "subhead" for&#13;
each implementing department and agency. Performance budgeting would be&#13;
introduced to relate expected physical performance with the funds budgeted for&#13;
each implementing agency. The performance budget would be the main document&#13;
for project implementation review. The project director would organize&#13;
training in performance budget formulation and use for all concerned staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
Once the budget is approved, the APC/PD would hold one or several meetings of&#13;
the Project Coordination Committee before the beginning of the fiscal year to&#13;
approve project activities.&#13;
3.27      The project would establish a special fund for promoting and&#13;
supporting innovative schemes consistent with project goals. The fund would&#13;
be operated by the Project Implementation Unit with the assistance of the&#13;
Project Coordination Committee and the NGO cell. Along with government&#13;
agencies, women's groups, NGOs, and farmer organizations would also&#13;
have access to the fund. The PCC would establish guidelines for securing&#13;
assistance from the fund within the first six months of project commencement.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
3.28      The PIU would regularly monitor project implementation progress and&#13;
correct any deficiencies. The project director supported, by consultants,&#13;
would be responsible for (a) identifying, through baseline surveys, target&#13;
groups of low-income beneficiaries for project activities, and (b) developing&#13;
an appropriate monitoring and evaluation system for delivery of management&#13;
information on implementation and performance through monitorable indicators&#13;
from the field. Data for assessing project development objectives would also&#13;
be collected through baseline surveys. Computer facilities would be provided&#13;
to help the PIU carry out this task. The consultants would also design a&#13;
training program for PIU staff. A matrix of monitorable indicators for&#13;
achievement of project objectives is presented in Annex 16.&#13;
Revorting. Mid-Term Review, and Project Implementation Report&#13;
3.29      Progress reports would be prepared by individual implementing&#13;
departments/agencies annually and submitted to the Project Guidance Committee&#13;
and Project Coordination Committee for clearance and consolidation by PIU&#13;
before being sent to the Bank, no later than 90 days after the end of each&#13;
fiscal year. Each report would contain brief descriptions of the main events&#13;
of the reporting period including progress of physical implementation,&#13;
expenditures incurred, staffing status, procurement, and force account&#13;
arrangements. These reports would compare actual data with targets of the&#13;
indicative plans and annual work programs. In addition, the GOA would submit&#13;
a copy of its annual project plan, state agricultural budget, and procurement&#13;
plan including civil works once every year (end of June) for Bank review and&#13;
comment.&#13;
3.30      An independent consultant would carry out a mid-term review of the&#13;
project at the end of the fourth year of implementation. The Review would&#13;
focus on progress made, take stock of the experience gained in implementing&#13;
individual components of the project, and evaluate problems associated with&#13;
participatory planning and implementation with beneficiaries. Agreed&#13;
recommendations of the mid-term review would be implemented by each&#13;
agency/department involved.  AQreement was obtained at neqotiations that the&#13;
GOA would, with the assistance of consultants. carry out a Mid-Term Review of&#13;
the project by June 30. 1999. (fourth year of proiect implementation) and&#13;
implement the recommendations of the mid-term review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
3.31      The PIU would prepare an implementation completion report on the&#13;
basis of the Bank's guidelines no later than six months after the closing date&#13;
of the credit. The report would highlight physical and financial problems&#13;
faced during implementation and assess the impact of the project to determine&#13;
whether the objectives were achieved.&#13;
Pro-ect Supervision&#13;
3.32      Project supervision would be closely linked to the project&#13;
objectives and the annual implementation plans. It would involve monitoring a&#13;
number of key indicators and assessing both quality and quantity aspects of&#13;
project implementation and their impact.&#13;
3.33      Heads of participating line departments would supervise project&#13;
implementation and provide guidance. In addition, the PIU would oversee&#13;
supervision of project activities to assess field implementation progress and&#13;
problems, involvement of beneficiary participation, and impact. The Bank&#13;
would normally field two missions in a year to focus primarily on key&#13;
implementation issues. The first mission would concentrate on detailed review&#13;
of the Annual work plan at the onset of the budget year; the second would&#13;
resolve problems, assess benefits, and draw lessons. However, full&#13;
responsibility for project supervision would rest with implementing line&#13;
departments and the PIU. Proposed experts on supervision missions are&#13;
presented in Annex 15.&#13;
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
4.1       The proposed project would contribute to the GOA's objectives for&#13;
poverty alleviation and to improve equity in the rural areas. It also would&#13;
accelerate agricultural growth through improved use of resources. The policy&#13;
reforms to be carried out through the project would lead to the allocation of&#13;
resources to high-priority investments for agricultural and rural development.&#13;
4.2       Specifically, the project would benefit about 300,000 poor rural&#13;
people by directly increasing their average annual net income from farming&#13;
alone by about 60%, from Rs 2,950 to Rs 4,720.1 In addition, while improving&#13;
the community assets, the construction works would generate about 75 million&#13;
man-days of seasonal and nonfarm employment through the road, fisheries, and&#13;
irrigation infrastructure supported under the project.2 Furthermore, the&#13;
nutrition of the rural population would be improved through increased&#13;
production of fish, fruit and vegetables, and milk.&#13;
1 Based on the average farm size (0.8 ha) of the majority (60%) of&#13;
area farmers.&#13;
2 Para 2.27 (procurement of works) and para 1.14 (labor rates).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
4.3       The project would improve communication, increase crop production,&#13;
employment opportunities, and rural incomes, and create sustainable production&#13;
assets. A network of 1,400 km of rural roads would be constructed, upgraded,&#13;
and maintained. Water would be made available to irrigate 49,000 ha of land&#13;
and increase the current cropping intensity of 140% by about 15% annually, to&#13;
reach 210% cropping intensity by the end of the project period. Rice&#13;
production would be improved by providing quality seeds, thereby increasing&#13;
marketable surplus. As a result of increased cropping intensity, higher&#13;
yields, and livestock and fisheries activities, annual employment in the&#13;
project areas would increase by about 3 million man-days at full&#13;
development.3 The project also would introduce an integrated management&#13;
system in planning and implementation, promote user group and NGO involvement&#13;
in the development process, and sensitize people to environmental issues.&#13;
4.4       Production and Marketing.  The project would increase the&#13;
production of food crops (rice, oilseeds, and pulses), fruits and vegetables,&#13;
milk, and fish. The bulk of the incremental food grain production would be&#13;
from irrigation schemes, including both new and rehabilitated schemes.&#13;
4.5       The following projected yield levels under the project are&#13;
conservative and attainable:&#13;

4.6       With irrigation, the cropping intensity would increase by about&#13;
451. Assuming the above conservative crop yields, the project would increase&#13;
the production of paddy, mustard, potatoes, and gram by 132,000, 5,000, 9,000,&#13;
and 5,000 tons, respectively, at full development about 10 years after the&#13;
start of the project. Crop and farm budgets under the present situation and&#13;
with improved irrigation intensity, presented in Annex 11, were used in the&#13;
computation of incremental value of production.&#13;
4.7       The rural population in Assam currently suffers frequent food&#13;
shortages mainly because of the weak resource base, including a poor&#13;
agricultural technology base. Most of the incremental production would be&#13;
consumed on the farm. A small portion (about lo) is expected to be sold in&#13;
3 Excludes direct employment in project works.&#13;
4 It was assumed that present yields would remain constant in the&#13;
without-project situation because there are no data to&#13;
illustrate either a declining or an increasing trend.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
neighboring markets, which would be more accessible with improvements to the&#13;
rural road system. Increasing surplus production, mainly fish, milk, fruit,&#13;
and vegetables, would be sold in the well-established existing markets.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
4.8       Individual rates of return for the irrigation, livestock,&#13;
horticulture, fisheries, and rural roads subcomponents and for the project as&#13;
a whole were estimated. The economic life of the project was assumed to be 30&#13;
years because of the types of investments involved. The institutional&#13;
development component was not evaluated, although its costs were included in&#13;
the overall economic evaluation of the project. Because of the&#13;
pilot nature of the land administration subcomponent, no rate of return (ERR)&#13;
was calculated. The economic and financial analyses are presented in Annex&#13;
11.&#13;
4.9       Irrigation.  Benefits were estimated on the basis of incremental&#13;
production of paddy, pulses, potatoes, and oilseeds. Economic prices&#13;
(constant end-1994) for these crops were derived from World Bank commodity&#13;
price projections issued in August 1994. Given the projected stagnation in&#13;
food grain production, India was assumed to be a marginal net importer.&#13;
Therefore, import parity prices, after adjusting for port handling and local&#13;
transport, were used in the analysis. Prices used are presented in Annex 1.&#13;
(tables 25 and 26). Irrigation facilities would also support summer and&#13;
winter production of vegetables, whose marketing would be enabled by the&#13;
project road network.&#13;
4.10      Rural Roads. Benefits of this component include reduced vehicle&#13;
operating costs and incremental portage and labor resulting from saved travel&#13;
time on upgraded roads. These estimates were derived from traffic surveys and&#13;
projections on selected roads undertaken by the Public Works Department and&#13;
confirmed by the Bank. Unquantifiable benefits from roads would include&#13;
increased incidence of literacy with greater access to schools, accessibility&#13;
to medical and health care facilities, accessibility to post offices and mini-&#13;
banks, and employment opportunities in road construction and maintenance.&#13;
4.11      Livestock.  Because of improvements to the breeding stock, milk&#13;
production would increase from the present 640 million liters per year to 780&#13;
million liters at full development. In addition, the protein intake of the&#13;
rural population would improve as a result of the project.&#13;
4.12      Fisheries. The project would increase fish production by about&#13;
3,000 tons annually. As a result rural incomes and nutritional value of food&#13;
intake would increase. Because of increased fish production, the market price&#13;
of fish is expected to fall to affordable levels, particularly for urban&#13;
dwellers with low incomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
4.13      Horticulture.  As a result of crop diversification to high-value&#13;
horticultural crops, about 8,250 hectares of marginal lands would be used for&#13;
production of arecanut, coconut, papaya, bananas, and oranges. With improved&#13;
yields, total annual incremental production is estimated to be 85,000 tons,&#13;
which would be marketed readily using improved roads. In addition, backyard&#13;
gardens for vegetable production would increase.&#13;
4.14      Project economic costs were derived from detailed cost tables&#13;
(summarized in Annex 5, tables 1 to 5), excluding taxes and price&#13;
contingencies. After the implementation period, recurrent costs were&#13;
maintained at a constant level for the economic life of the project. It was&#13;
assumed that Vehicles and machinery and equipment associated with road&#13;
maintenance would be replaced every five years. Because rural roads yield&#13;
benefits to sectors other than agriculture that could not be estimated, only&#13;
one-half of the cost of road construction and maintenance was included in the&#13;
economic evaluation. On-farm production costs were derived from crop budgets&#13;
(Annex 11, tables 1 to 18), with assumed conservative and gradual yield&#13;
increases and adoption of improved farming practices as a result of&#13;
availability of production inputs such as irrigation water, fertilizers, and&#13;
pesticides.&#13;
4.15      Recurrent costs for fish and livestock production were estimated&#13;
from individual enterprise budgets used in the ERR. All local costs&#13;
(including market prices for locally traded products such as milk, fish,&#13;
fruits, and vegetables) were converted to border values by using a standard&#13;
conversion factor of 0.9. ERRs for irrigation, roads, livestock, fisheries,&#13;
and horticulture activities were estimated to be 57%, 33%, 21%, 22%, and 66%,&#13;
respectively. The ERR for the project as a whole was estimated to be 24%,&#13;
which is a weighted average of the individual components' ERRs. The net&#13;
present value of the project, discounted at the opportunity cost of capital of&#13;
12%, is estimated to be Rs 2,423 million (US$78 million).&#13;
4.16      Sensitivity Analyses. Tests were performed on the ERR of the&#13;
project as a whole. Cost overruns and delays in accrued incremental benefits&#13;
could occur, notwithstanding built-in safeguards in the project. Certain&#13;
assumptions were introduced in the analysis and sensitivity tests performed.&#13;
Results are summarized below:&#13;
Test Variations                             ERR          NPV&#13;
(Rs M)&#13;
Base Case                                   24%          2,423&#13;
Benefits down 10%                           22%          1,946&#13;
Benefits down 15t                           21%          1,707&#13;
Costs up 10%                                22%          2,188&#13;
Benefits lagged 2 years                     18%          1,381&#13;
Benefits down 10% and costs up 10%          20%          1,711&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.17      The overall project ERR is reasonably robust to increases in costs&#13;
and reductions in benefits. Nevertheless, special arrangements, such as&#13;
identification and preparation of the first-year program, including&#13;
retroactive financing, have been made to accelerate start-up activities and&#13;
minimize implementation delays.&#13;
4.18      SwitchinQ value tests show that project costs would have to&#13;
increase by more than 110% or benefits would have to drop by more than SO0 for&#13;
the NPV to fall to zero or the ERR to fall to 12%. The intensive preparation&#13;
and detailed work in estimating the cost of individual items make these&#13;
situations unlikely. Further more, conservative estimates of yields and&#13;
production were used in evaluating the benefits.&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
4.19      An environmental analysis of the project was carried out by&#13;
reviewing each component using guidelines in the Bank's Operational Directive&#13;
4.0. Based on this analysis, the project was categorized as "B" (Annex 18).&#13;
The project would have an overall positive impact on the environment through&#13;
improvement of agricultural practices and land management. The Project&#13;
Implementation Unit would hire an environmentalist who would have&#13;
responsibility for developing and implementing guidelines for monitoring all&#13;
project activities for potential negative environmental impact and advising on&#13;
mitigating measures. If necessary, technical assistance would be sought from&#13;
government agencies, such as the Pollution Control Board (for water quality&#13;
monitoring), the Department of Science, Technology, and Environment, and the&#13;
Assam Council for Science, Technology, and the Environment.&#13;
4.20      The only possible negative environmental impact of the project&#13;
could be soil erosion caused by road construction. To minimize this&#13;
possibility, the project was designed with appropriate mitigating actions.&#13;
These actions include:&#13;
(a) sensitizing government staff and user groups to the hazards of poor&#13;
environmental protection;&#13;
(b) minimizing, and in some cases avoiding, land acquisition and&#13;
penalizing road projects with negative environmental effects in a&#13;
screening process; and&#13;
(c) monitoring the incidence of disease and destroying vector breeding&#13;
areas, for example cleaning ponds for fish production to eliminate&#13;
breeding grounds for mosquitoes and vectors for malaria parasites.&#13;
Imoact on Women&#13;
4.21      Women in Assam play a major role in agriculture and appear eager to&#13;
be involved in new income-generating activities, but they lack resources and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
technical knowledge to initiate and sustain new enterprises. The GOA's&#13;
organized support services for women are largely directed toward welfare and&#13;
child care. In an effort to reverse the trend, socially oriented NGOs are&#13;
actively involved in training more women in the skills needed to participate&#13;
in economic activities. The need to create more jobs for women is even&#13;
greater in the wage labor market in Assam where they are poorly represented.&#13;
Of the total employment of 1 million at the end of March 1989, less than 0.3&#13;
million, or 301, were women.&#13;
4.22      The productive role of women varies significantly in the project&#13;
area depending on the economic status of each family in the village. The vast&#13;
majority of women do a significant amount of manual work, including building&#13;
road, collecting fuel wood, marketing farm produce, and performing household&#13;
chores. women are also responsible for ensuring adequate nutrition for their&#13;
families. Therefore, investments under the project such as improvement in the&#13;
infrastructure (rural roads), and the production of livestock, fish, fruits,&#13;
and vegetables would contribute to the welfare of women. Involving female&#13;
beneficiaries in project planning, including selection of activities and their&#13;
location, would give them an opportunity to express their views on those&#13;
issues that affect them most. Also, women in the project area would save&#13;
travel time to perform household errands, which could be deployed for more&#13;
productive and lucrative purposes. Women would also benefit from increased&#13;
incomes from milk and fish production. In general, women laborers would&#13;
benefit from significantly enhanced employment opportunities.&#13;
4.23      To ensure that women participate actively in the design, planning&#13;
and, implementation of project activities, a position for a women's&#13;
development officer would also be created in the Project Implementation Unit.&#13;
This officer would be an active member of the project management and would&#13;
ensure that the project provides women with appropriate training in awareness&#13;
of their role and benefits, organization and management and technical skills&#13;
(see Annex 10). Support would also be provided to women's groups for&#13;
innovative economic initiatives consistent with project objectives.&#13;
Cost Recoverv&#13;
4.24      Full cost recovery from beneficiaries for all activities would not&#13;
be feasible under this project because of the high incidence of poverty and&#13;
the extent of subsidies in the project area. However, because the GOA's&#13;
budgetary resources are constrained and would not be able to ensure&#13;
sustainability of investments in the project area, cost recovery would be&#13;
introduced. For investments including fisheries development in farmers'&#13;
ponds, community tanks, shallow tube wells and introductory horticultural&#13;
production, beneficiaries would be required to pay a proportion of the cost of&#13;
establishment.&#13;
4.25      During the construction period, beneficiaries organized into users&#13;
groups or individual farmers would contribute at least 30% of the investment&#13;
cost of any irrigation scheme, fish pond, or community fish tank. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35-&#13;
contribution could be direct cash payment or in-kind payment (e.g., labor).&#13;
After the construction phase, the assets would be transferred to beneficiaries&#13;
who would be responsible for the full O&amp;M cost. For large fish beels, the&#13;
full cost of construction would be recovered from the private or cooperative&#13;
operators, who would also be responsible for repair and maintenance of the&#13;
fish assets leased to them. Regarding seedlings for horticultural development&#13;
and artificial insemination for the livestock improvement program,&#13;
beneficiaries would pay over time the full cost of the material and service.&#13;
4.26      Incremental income from project investments would justify such cost&#13;
recoveries. Because beneficiaries would be involved in the project planning&#13;
process, including selection of activities and their location, and would own&#13;
and operate some of these assets, they would have the incentive to collect&#13;
user charges from their fellow members to extend the usefulness of their&#13;
assets.&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
4.27      Once completed, project activities would be sustained.  Incremental&#13;
staffing would be kept to the minimum, and additional recurrent costs would be&#13;
within manageable limits. Most of the assets created by the project would be&#13;
transferred to the beneficiaries, who would operate the assets and share the&#13;
cost of operation and maintenance. Production assets in horticulture,&#13;
fisheries, and livestock would be supported through ongoing research and&#13;
extension services. Local NGOs would continue to support water user groups in&#13;
managing tube wells and ponds constructed under the project. The improved&#13;
policy environment, especially for marketing and processing, would provide&#13;
financial incentives for the groups to maintain their newly acquired assets.&#13;
Rural roads would be maintained by the GOA out of its state budget; through&#13;
the project, the GOA would have prepared a state policy and financing&#13;
arrangements for road repair and maintenance [para 2.15(b)].&#13;
Risks&#13;
4.28      The project faces four major risks:&#13;
(a) Funding. Poor budgetary support could slow down implementation.&#13;
To minimize the risk, the GOA would submit an annual budget and&#13;
commit itself to improve cost recovery and establish adequate&#13;
financial control measures that would be monitored during project&#13;
implementation. Funding needed for O&amp;M would be the responsibility&#13;
of the beneficiaries. Pace of implementation, quality of&#13;
construction, and delivery of services would be monitored by local&#13;
NGOs and reported to concerned agencies every six months.&#13;
(b) Policy Reform and Commitment. Timely and effective implementation&#13;
and adherence by the GOA to the agreed policy reforms are crucial&#13;
to the success of the project. To minimize the risk, tangible&#13;
proof of readiness to implement the reforms has already been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
demonstrated in the preparation of the state agricultural strategy&#13;
paper and the steps already taken to implement the items described&#13;
in the policy matrix. Implementation of policy reforms would be&#13;
reflected in the GOA's annual work plans and budgets for Bank&#13;
review. There would be close Bank supervision to ensure that dated&#13;
covenants associated with the reforms are met. Despite the built-&#13;
in safeguards, however, implementation of policy reform could be&#13;
delayed or even modified due to political events. General&#13;
elections will be held in 1996, and the political scenario in the&#13;
country is changing fast. Announcements of populistic measures&#13;
involving hand-outs from public funds are increasing markedly. It&#13;
would be unrealistic to expect that Assam would not be influenced&#13;
by this political trend.&#13;
(c) Institutional Capacit . The success of the project depends on&#13;
active participation of local and national NGOs. There is the risk&#13;
that such participation may be slow to materialize, and government&#13;
bureaucracy may delay the transfer of new assets to the farming&#13;
communities. Also, institutional weakness could pose risks for&#13;
project implementation. Quality of works (construction and&#13;
maintenance of rural roads) could suffer from inadequate staffing,&#13;
supervision, and standard enforcement. To enhance quality of&#13;
construction, the project would provide technical assistance to&#13;
train and motivate staff.&#13;
(d) Security. The security situation in Assam may delay field visits,&#13;
implementation, and timely supervision and monitoring. Project&#13;
activities and investment programs would be restricted to areas&#13;
where security problems are minimal. Active involvement of&#13;
beneficiaries (FMCs, WUA, etc) in the decision-making process and&#13;
their ownership of the project should reduce the security risk.&#13;
4.29      With GOA's commitment and demonstrated support, and with built-in&#13;
safeguards for sustaining operations, the project has a chance of succeeding.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.1       During negotiations the following agreements were obtained that the&#13;
GOA would:&#13;
(a) ensure that project implementing departments/agencies maintain&#13;
separate accounts for all components supported under the project&#13;
and implement proposed audit arrangements (para 2.33);&#13;
(b) contract with NGOs selected according to criteria agreed with the&#13;
Association to participate in project activities (para 3.8);&#13;
(c) maintain a Project Implementation Unit with staffing and&#13;
responsibilities agreed with the Association (para 3.9);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
(d) maintain the Project Guidance Committee and the Project&#13;
Coordination Committee with membership and responsibilities agreed&#13;
with the Association (para 3.11);&#13;
(e) prepare and submit to the IDA by the end of March of each year&#13;
starting in 1996 annual work plans and budgets for the project&#13;
satisfactory to the Association (para 3.17);&#13;
(f) carry out land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation of&#13;
any people affected under the project in accordance with&#13;
arrangements and procedures agreed with the Association (para&#13;
3.22);&#13;
(g) ensure that implementing departments' and agencies' staff interact&#13;
with beneficiaries and agree on the choice, location, design,&#13;
preparation, and implementation of activities supported by the&#13;
project (para 3.24); and&#13;
(h) carry out with the assistance of consultants, a mid-term review by&#13;
June 30, 1999, (end of the fourth year of project implementation)&#13;
and implement the recommendations of the review (para 3.30).&#13;
Condition of Disbursement&#13;
5.2       Disbursement of Credit proceeds for rural road repair and&#13;
maintenance would be conditional to preparation of a road maintenance policy,&#13;
financing arrangements and an implementation plan satisfactory to the&#13;
Association [para 2.15(b)].&#13;
5.3       With the above assurances and agreements, the project would be&#13;
suitable for an IDA credit of SDR 81.0 million (US$126.0 million equivalent)&#13;
on standard terms with 35 years maturity.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 1.&#13;
ASSAM RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
General Features of Assam&#13;
Irrigation&#13;
1.        The Brahmaputra valley covers 70t of the total area of the state.&#13;
Total food requi-rement by the year 2000 would be 6.3 million tons for the&#13;
state population of about 28.5 millions. The additional food requirement&#13;
would be about 2.5 million tons of which rice would account for about 2.2&#13;
million tons. To increase future rice production sufficient to feed the&#13;
projected population, the cropping intensity must be enhanced to more than. 200&#13;
t by extending irrigation.&#13;
2.        Most of the rain in Assam falls between May/June and&#13;
September/October. As a consequence, supplementary irrigation during the dry&#13;
months becomes necessary if cropping intensity is to be increased. Under&#13;
normal circumstances, floods affect about 0.4 million ha annually. It is&#13;
estimated that 0.3 million ha of cropped areas are flood prone, though&#13;
occasionally about one million ha are affected by floods. As a result,&#13;
farmers in the flood prone areas need a winter crop with irrigation to sustain&#13;
themselves.&#13;
3.        Out of the total geographic area of about 7.8 million ha, total&#13;
cultivable area is about 2.7 million ha. Surface water potential is 1.7&#13;
million ha consisting of about one million ha under major/medium projects and&#13;
the rest under minor projects. Total ground water potential is estimated to&#13;
be one million ha, accounted for by 5,000 deep tube wells -DTWs-(0.2 million&#13;
ha), 241,700 shallow tube wells-STWs-(0.7 million ha) and 141,000 dug wells&#13;
(less than 0.1 million ha). However out of 1142 existing DTWs only about 620&#13;
or 54% are operating at less than 25% efficiency. The poor performance of&#13;
these DTWs is partly caused by frequent power-cuts in the agricultural areas.&#13;
In most cases power supply is provided for 2-3 hours per day instead of the&#13;
required time of 6-8 hours.   Because of the poor supply of electricity, GOA&#13;
does not plan to develop new DTWs during the next decade.&#13;
4.        In the case of STWs, about 49,735 have been installed by the Assam&#13;
State Minor Irrigation Development Corporation (ASMIDC) through a NABARD&#13;
refinanced scheme. Due to poor recovery of the loans from farmers, the&#13;
outstanding repayments with ASMIDC have become unmanageable (Rs 403 million).&#13;
As a result, ASMIDC virtually stopped all STW activities in the state. To&#13;
continue- the program, the Agriculture Department took over the task of&#13;
installing STWs through the Community Irrigation Project (CIP) supported by&#13;
GOI subsidy scheme, which has also stopped for lack of resources and poor&#13;
performance.&#13;
5.        Other problems associated with the supply of electricity to the&#13;
irrigation schemes are those of overdue payments. As of 1994, the Irrigation&#13;
Department owed Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) about Rs 102 million.&#13;
About 30t of the overdue is accounted for by public DTWs and 70t by Surface&#13;
Lift schemes (SLs). Some of the overdue amounts are a result of "flat rate"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
charges imposed by ASEB on irrigation schemes irrespective of the power&#13;
consumed. It is a practice for ASEB to charge Rs.30/month/unit for the DTWs&#13;
and Sls even when no power was consumed.   Despite the inadequate billing&#13;
system, ASEB is planning to increase power rates for agriculture from Rs 0.88&#13;
to Rs 1.60/unit due to the high cost of generation which is about Rs.&#13;
2.61/unit. The proposed increase would make electricity rates in the state&#13;
uniform with those for domestic consumers, currently paying Rs. 1.61/unit.&#13;
6.        Because there was no mechanism in place for collection of water&#13;
charges, the revenue collected by the Irrigation Department has always been&#13;
negligible. To correct the problem, GOA issued a notification in June 1992 to&#13;
fix and collect water charges from beneficiaries of all irrigation schemes.&#13;
The per hectare irrigation charges for a Kharif crop is Rs. 140.62, Wheat Rs.&#13;
281.25, Early Ahu and Ahu Rs. 375.50. Total charges per annum amount to Rs.&#13;
797.37 per hectare. These charges are less than the actual cost of&#13;
irrigation. It is estimated the annual cost of irrigating one hectare is&#13;
about Rs. 1310 for STWs, Rs 2449 in the case of DTWs, Rs 4324 for Surface&#13;
lifts(Sls), and Rs 2508 for diversion schemes.&#13;
7.        With-electricity, the irrigation cost per hectare per annum is&#13;
estimated to be Rs 870 for STW, Rs 1550 for DTW, and Rs 1258 for Sls. In the&#13;
case of diesel pumps the cost is estimated to be Rs 1740, Rs 3560, and Rs 3200&#13;
per hectare per annum respectively. For diversion schemes it would be Rs 704&#13;
per ha per annum. These amounts exclude the establishment cost of the&#13;
Irrigation Department, which is estimated to be Rs. 200 per hectare per annum.&#13;
B.        The Central Ground Water Board has estimated through its 462 work&#13;
stations the annual recharge of ground water in the valley. The hydrographs&#13;
show a peak followed by a recession limb. The recession limb in the post&#13;
monsoon period is steep during August to October months and gentle during&#13;
NJovember - April. The steep limb indicates that whatever the rise in the&#13;
groundwater level, a major part dissipates during the monsoon period&#13;
maintaining a constant level on average through out the year. Recharges based&#13;
on pre-as well as post-monsoon levels have been used to estimate the district&#13;
wise annual recoverable recharge. Existing data has established that aquifers&#13;
get fully recharges by July - August and additional water in the ground goes&#13;
as reject recharge.&#13;
Roads&#13;
9.        Excluding National highways and those main roads whose improvement&#13;
is funded by the North East Council (NEC), there is a network of about 7,300&#13;
km of surfaced roads and 23,700 km of graveled roads maintained by the state&#13;
PWD. There is also a total length of about 148,000 m of timber bridges.&#13;
Chronic under funding of road maintenance which has persisted for many years&#13;
(about one third of the Finance Commission's recommended level of funding has&#13;
been actually budgeted) has caused the road network to be in a distressful&#13;
condition. Most of these roads are long overdue for rehabilitation and a&#13;
large number of the timber bridges have long past their economic life and are&#13;
in a dangerous condition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
10.       In addition to the PWD-maintained network of roads, there is&#13;
another network of roads comprising about 7,200 km at the village level in the&#13;
rural areas, built by the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA). These&#13;
roads are vital as they link small villages with the State road network.&#13;
These roads were labor-intensively built, partly as a means of employment&#13;
generation, but were not in compliance with accepted specifications. As a&#13;
result, PWD has been reluctant to assume responsibility for their maintenance.&#13;
11.       It is important to note however, that most roads in Assam were not&#13;
built according to designed specifications particularly in regard to&#13;
embankment placement and compaction. This initial construction deficiency has&#13;
been compounded over the years by lack of maintenance funds (for example: over&#13;
the last four years, the budget allocation for road maintenance has been&#13;
declining from 23% of the required amount to about 9%.), thereby causing a&#13;
deplorable condition of the entire road network in the state.&#13;
Land holding and Cropping Pattern&#13;
12.       The average farm size of 1.3 hectares is the smallest in the&#13;
country and declining. Despite the small land holdings, they are further&#13;
fragmented into 3-4 parcels making them uneconomic units to support the&#13;
average family size of five. The cropping pattern which is dominated by paddy&#13;
of long maturity periods tends to limit the cropping intensity to less than&#13;
145 percent. Given the high rainfall in the area, this cropping intensity is&#13;
also considerably low.&#13;
Rural Credit&#13;
13.       Lack of access to credit by small-entrepreneurs and small farmers&#13;
tends to perpetuate poverty. For farmers to have flexibility in the risky&#13;
farming environment, they need access to production inputs and sufficient&#13;
income or credit to acquire them.&#13;
14.       In the case of Assam, because of small land holdings, poor land&#13;
record keeping by the revenue office and the lengthy process of granting loans&#13;
by commercial banks, the majority of small farmers do not qualify for credit.&#13;
The few who qualify do not repay their loans promptly. As a result, small&#13;
farmers fail to adopt new agricultural technology, such as the use of&#13;
fertilizer and hybrid seed, which could be facilitated through credit.&#13;
Fisheries Development&#13;
15.       The potential for fish production in Assam is enormous with an&#13;
estimated area of over 300,000 hectares of water bodies, including rivers,&#13;
beels, tanks and ponds, swamps and a reservoir. The current annual production&#13;
is estimated to be 150,000 tons against actual demand of over 250,000 tons.&#13;
The present per capita consumption of fish is estimated to be 6-7 kilograms,&#13;
which is well below the nutritional requirement of about 10-12 kilograms per&#13;
capita. Because of the high demand of fish in the state, the price of fish&#13;
ranges between Rs. 40-60 per kilogram, which is relatively high for most&#13;
consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
Horticulture&#13;
16.       Assam has a great potential for expansion of horticultural&#13;
production. Out of net cultivable area of 2.7 million hectares less than 20&#13;
percent is under horticultural crops, mostly grown as homestead gardens.&#13;
Commercial cultivation of horticultural crops faces a numDer of constraints&#13;
includipig poor quality of planting material, long gestation ppriods of common&#13;
species in the area, heavy initial investment, lack of&#13;
technical packages, inadequate extension service, weak post-harvest&#13;
infrastructure and poor roads and transportation system for marketing.&#13;
Livestock Development&#13;
17.       Despite the large population of livestock in Assam (estimated to be&#13;
7.5 million of which more than one million could be improved), its               -&#13;
productivity is low mainly because of the poor genetic potential and&#13;
inadequate nutrition.  To increase annual milk and meat production from about&#13;
640 million liters and 13,000 tons respectively, the GOA existing program is&#13;
designed to improve the indigenous dairy cattle by cross-breeding with exotic&#13;
animals.  GOA believes this can be achieved through a combination of the use&#13;
of purchased frozen pure Jersey semen, bulls of exotic breed and a 50 t&#13;
Jersey-indigenous frozen semen from elite local bulls.&#13;
Extension service&#13;
18.       Provision of agricultural extension service in the state is the&#13;
responsibility of the Department of Agriculture. The department functions&#13;
through Agricultural Extension Officers in-charge of districts and subject&#13;
matter specialists and local level cadres, Village Level Extension Workers&#13;
(VLEWs). The extension system applied is that of Training and Visit (T&amp;V)&#13;
promoted and supported by the Bank through the National Agricultural Extension&#13;
Projects. Though the schematic arrangement of the provision of extension&#13;
service is impressive, the Training and Visit (T&amp;V) system has become&#13;
ineffective because of the growing multi-function responsibility of the&#13;
extension agents contrary to the concept of the system itself. Additionally,&#13;
the system lacks viable technological messages to convey to the farmer.&#13;
19.       The training program for extension workers is based on simple&#13;
repetitive messages, which are only appropriate for promoting technological&#13;
packages of a single crop.  The training is not responsive to needs of&#13;
diversification at the farm level.  Extension workers need to be trained to&#13;
deliver multiple messages, advise on a large variety of crops and provide&#13;
market information, all in the same regular visits.&#13;
20.       In Assam, VLEWs are assisted by multi-purpose Field Management&#13;
Committees (FMC) covering 2-3 villages. So far, there are more than 10,000&#13;
registered FMCs in the state responsible for over 22,000 villages.&#13;
To improve the effectiveness of the extension service, GOA plans to use FMCs&#13;
as probe groups to keep the department activities on the right track and&#13;
ensure farmers' involvement in planning and implementation of agricultural&#13;
schemes. Using a group approach would be a new dimension of using extension&#13;
service as a broad based tool for technology transfer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
Public Expenditure&#13;
21.       Tue objective of the state development plan was to reduce the&#13;
incidence of poverty from 52% of the population living below the poverty line&#13;
in 1978 to 23% in 1990 and-10% by 1995. Additionally, the plan was to reduce&#13;
the rural population dependent on agriculture (currently estimated to be 70%&#13;
of the population) to small scale industries by 10-15S. To achieve this, GOA&#13;
decided to direct public expenditure to rural development activities.&#13;
22.       Though physical and financial targets were achieved by 1992, the&#13;
incidence of poverty remained unchanged. Development expenditure was diverted&#13;
to provide short-term relief, including employment generating activities and&#13;
support to rural programs. Effective programs could not be promoted due to&#13;
weaknesses in the implementation machinery.&#13;
23.       The focus of implementation of the rural programs was directed&#13;
towards providing financial assistance to as many people as possible without&#13;
regard to the long-term objective of poverty reduction. More effective&#13;
monitoring and control systems were not in place to ensure the need for&#13;
increasing the productive capacity of the target groups. Basically, the&#13;
financial assistance was used as unemployment allowances for the rural&#13;
population.&#13;
24.       Because of the short term objectives of the programs, there was a&#13;
significant increase in revenue expenditure, crowding out expenditure for&#13;
capital formation across all sectors, including agriculture. In most cases,&#13;
subsidies accounted for most of the revenue expenditure increase. The growth&#13;
in expenditure was also caused by increased salaries and wages and to a&#13;
limited extent, increases in operation and maintenance of fixed assets. The&#13;
extent of subsidies varied between 50 and 100% depending on -the type of&#13;
activity and source of finance. Activities supported by GOI were fully&#13;
subsidized and those by GOA were paid for by beneficiaries up to 50% of the&#13;
cost.&#13;
25.       Despite the high subsidy rates for crop production inputs, such as&#13;
seeds of high yielding varieties (HYV) and fertilizers, their up take remained&#13;
low partly because of the limitations on the quantity handled by licensed&#13;
distributors. The process of obtaining licenses was also long and cumbersome.&#13;
License holders are required to maintain separate registers for subsidized&#13;
inputs which are sold at fixed prices set by government. Invariably, these&#13;
prices do not cover local transport and handling expenses and bank charges,&#13;
including interest on borrowed funds for input purchases. Even depreciation&#13;
and profit margins were not factored in the price estimate.&#13;
26.       Though part of the revenue expenditure was for O&amp;M, more than 50%&#13;
of the increase went to salaries and wages. As a result, public assets in the&#13;
state continue to deteriorate for lack of adequate maintenance. The&#13;
Integrated Rural Development Projects (IRDP) are given priority in state&#13;
budgets for two main reasons. Firstly, the projects are supported by the&#13;
central government and are a source of funds for the state, and secondly these&#13;
projects are supposed to support families below the poverty line, which is&#13;
consistent with the overall state development objective. During the last five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
year development plan, more than 80% of the actual expenditure in the state&#13;
was allocated to rural development projects. For example, in 1991/92 alone,&#13;
about 83t of the budget or an equivalent of Rs. 172 million was spent on rural&#13;
development related activities.&#13;
27.   -   Despite large sums of money are spent on rural programs, the&#13;
quality of life of the target group continued to decline. Also, financing&#13;
from the center, which is expected to cover more than 50% of the IRDP budget,&#13;
was not released as planed, causing additional strain on the state budget&#13;
leading to unfinished projects.&#13;
Sources of State Revenue&#13;
28.       Public funds in the state include receipts from cost recoveries,&#13;
grants, loans, cess and surcharges, taxes and non-tax sources. Cost recovery&#13;
for various sectors has remained low for many years. There have been no water&#13;
charges paid by farmers from public irrigation schemes and new tariffs set for&#13;
power have been introduced recently. The mechanism for cost recovery is&#13;
basically non existent.&#13;
Center and State Financing&#13;
29.       Public expenditure in the agriculture and allied sectors is&#13;
allocated in plan and non-plan schemes, central sector schemes and central&#13;
sponsored schemes. State plan and non plan schemes are entirely financed by&#13;
the state budget while central sector schemes are wholly funded by the central&#13;
government. In the centrally sponsored schemes, the proportion of central and&#13;
state funds varies between schemes and sectors. Some of the central sponsored&#13;
activities are supported by loans and grants specifically assigned to those&#13;
schemes.&#13;
30.       Most of the expenditure in the state plan and non-plan schemes is&#13;
supported by the state budget. However, capital expenditure is shared between&#13;
the state and the center depending on the type of scheme concerned. In&#13;
general, revenue has tended to be smaller than expenditure. It is worthy&#13;
noting that whenever expenditure was incurred from a loan amount, this was&#13;
provided for in the state plan. In most cases, loans were used to finance&#13;
schemes in the crop husbandry sector. Only in exceptional cases were loan&#13;
funds used to finance dairy and fisheries development activities.   It was&#13;
clear in the analysis of the public expenditure in the state that the&#13;
composition of expenditure was highly variable and showed no trend. This out&#13;
come underscores the poor quality of planning and resource allocation&#13;
mechanism in the state government bureaucracy.&#13;
Public Enterprises&#13;
31.       Most public enterprises in agriculture and allied sectors fail to&#13;
accomplish their stated objectives. They are more involved in activities&#13;
outside their jurisdiction. Their financial performance has also been&#13;
unsatisfactory. The operating expenses-have out stripped revenue. The&#13;
management of the working capital has also been inadequate, maintaining high&#13;
levels of slow moving inventories and poor collection rates of receivables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
Most of thexe organizations have poor gearing ratios exhibiting high debt&#13;
equity ratios and are involved in non-profitable operations. Because of the&#13;
poor performance, many _enterprises have survived through massive infusion of&#13;
public funds in the form of grants and loans from government.&#13;
32.       Despite vast fertile agricultural land and abundant rainfall over&#13;
the successive plan periods, Assam continues to remain economically backward&#13;
and poor. The state imports food grains equivalent to Rs.7,000 million&#13;
annually. This amount could be invested in the state for further development&#13;
if the state was self sufficient in food grains.&#13;
Subsidies&#13;
33.       The state government spends large sums of money in providing&#13;
subsidies to farmers f6r agricultural inputs including, fertilizers,&#13;
irrigation water, electricity and credit. During 1990 alone, GOA spent more&#13;
than Rs. 100 million on subsidies for seed, fertilizer and farm implements.&#13;
However; from the 1970s, fertilizer has continued to be subsidized by GOI&#13;
through a nationwide fertilizer subsidy scheme. In addition to the general&#13;
subsidy for these inputs, GOA provides special subsidies for fertilizers,&#13;
seeds, farm machinery, small implements to identified needy farmers through&#13;
various state agricultural development programs.&#13;
34.       The main target group for these special subsidies include marginal&#13;
and small farmers. The subsidy rates range between 25% for small implements,&#13;
50t for fertilizers and 100t for irrigation water. The selection of the&#13;
marginal and small farmers depends on their "land based economic identity",&#13;
which creates a latitude for abuse by administrators of the subsidy program.&#13;
35.       A separate study (Impact of Subsidies on Agricultural Development&#13;
in Assam by the state Agricultural University) established that, withdrawal of&#13;
subsidies in agriculture would lead to insignificant drop in the State&#13;
Domestic Product. However, given the high opportunity cost of capital in the&#13;
state due to scarcity of resources, the marginal return on investment for the&#13;
subsidy amount in other activities would be enormous.&#13;
Agricultural Inputs&#13;
36.       Fertil"ii.  Nitrogenous fertilizers in Assam are manufactured by&#13;
Public Corporations which also market about 80% of their production through&#13;
sister organizations in Guwahati, the state capital. Though the remaining&#13;
quantity of fertilizer is distributed by private dealers under license, the&#13;
price of fertilizer is still controlled and set by government. Because of the&#13;
subsidy element in the pricing structure of the fertilizer, and the laborious&#13;
procedures for obtaining licenses, private distributors are discouraged from&#13;
handling this commodity, particularly in remote areas where distribution costs&#13;
are relatively high.&#13;
37.       Assam farmers consume the lowest quantity of fertilizers in the&#13;
country. Between 1987 and 1992, fertilizer consumption averaged 8 kilograms&#13;
per hectare, with the highest level attained in 1991 mainly due to extenxive&#13;
campaign including increased subsidy from 10 to 20 percent of the fertilizer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
price. Other factors limiting the use of fertilizer in the state is the poor&#13;
infrastructure for input delivery and inadequate control of water for&#13;
irrigation. It is estimated only 20 percent of the cropped area is irrigated&#13;
annually.&#13;
38.   -   The responsibility for fertilizer procurement and distribution lies&#13;
with the public sector organizations (Assam Agro-Industries Development&#13;
Corporation-AAIDC, and STATFED). However, most of the fertilizer is diverced&#13;
to the tea plantations (preferred customers) leaving small quantities for food&#13;
grain production.  Though farmers understand the benefit of using fertilizers,&#13;
the product is either.not available when required or it is the wrong type when&#13;
delivered. This situation is caused by liquidity problems of the state&#13;
government which is unable to finance fertilizer procurement, and the poor&#13;
market analysis by public sector corporations handling fertilizers&#13;
distribution, to determine actual demand.&#13;
39.       Seeds.  As for HYV, the level of adoption has also lagged behind&#13;
mainly because of unavailability of suitable early maturing varieties of&#13;
cereals including paddy which is the main grain crop. Because of the special&#13;
climate and soils in the state, agricultural technologies including improved&#13;
crop varieties developed in other parts of the country have proven to be&#13;
unsuitable in Assam.&#13;
40.       The government of Assam established the Assam Seeds Corporation&#13;
late in 1960s to produce and distribute seeds in the state. The corporation&#13;
produces certified and foundation seeds in its own farms and distributes it&#13;
through the Department of Agriculture. However, in exceptional cases, it sub-&#13;
contracts registered private growers to produce certified paddy seed. As in&#13;
the case of fertilizers, subsidies discourage private dealers from handling&#13;
seed as well.&#13;
41.       The responsibility for breeder seed production lies exclusively&#13;
with the Assam Agricultural University (AAU). Though certified seed is&#13;
produced by ASC, Department of Agriculture and private seed growers, its&#13;
certification is done by another agency, the Assam State Seed Certification&#13;
Agency (ASSCA). Nevertheless, the responsibility for seed procurement from&#13;
other states and agencies still lies with ASC. Actual distribution to farmers&#13;
is handled by village level farmers cooperative organizations (Gaon Panchayat&#13;
Samabay Samathi-GPSS). Because of the large number of players involved in the&#13;
seed industry, logistical problems render the system ineffective. Efforts to&#13;
strengthen seed production can not succeed unless the distribution system is&#13;
streamlined through the private sector.&#13;
Land Tenure&#13;
42.       Assam state introduced Land reform laws since India's independence&#13;
in 1947. Their objective was to protect share croppers from indiscriminate&#13;
eviction. The laws provide tenants the right of occupation and cultivation of&#13;
the land for 3-5 years. The laws also established crop-rent to be paid by&#13;
tenants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
43.       The state enacted Land Ceiling and Consolidation Acts to limit the&#13;
size of land holding for equity reason and provide economic units&#13;
for agricultural production. Because of the weak administrative structure and&#13;
poor land records, enforcing the laws is difficult.&#13;
44.   -   Also, Communal land laws exist which restrict unauthorized use of&#13;
open grazing lands for other purpose. The government charges grazing fees on&#13;
such lands. Because the rates charged are so low, there is no incentive for&#13;
farmers to reduce the population-of livestock and increase their productivity.&#13;
Marketing and Croo Movement&#13;
45.       The poor marketing infrastructure for agricultural produce in the&#13;
state is caused by underdeveloped transport and communication, inadequate&#13;
provision of institutional credit in rural areas, lack of market information&#13;
and inadequate storage facilities. As a result production of high value&#13;
crops, such as fruits and vegetables and increased production of grains is&#13;
hampered despite the existing potential.&#13;
46.       In an effort to improve the price of agricultural produce, GOA&#13;
established Regulated Markets for major crops, under the Assam Agricultural&#13;
Market Act of 1972. These markets provide facilities such as storage,&#13;
weighing scales, and act as produce collection centers for whole sale&#13;
marketing. Some of these centers are terminal markets for produce destined to&#13;
larger out of state markets. However, the poor marketing arrangements caused&#13;
mostly by government intervention, and sometimes the need for trans-shipment&#13;
at rail road terminals because of different rail gauges; high handling costs&#13;
reduce the final price paid to producers.&#13;
47.       Under the Essential Commodities Act, GOA has enacted laws&#13;
restricting movement of paddy, rice, pulses and oilseeds outside the state and&#13;
empowered public agencies to be sole buyers of such produce. The statutory&#13;
prices paid to growers are in most cases lower than market prices. Though the&#13;
objective of public control over marketable surplus was to eliminate price&#13;
fluctuations in the market and ensure availability of produce to consumers at&#13;
"reasonable price", the effort has nevertheless failed to abolish private&#13;
markets. Because of government controls, private dealers create artificial&#13;
scarcity of certain commodities to exploit consumers. In such an arrangement,&#13;
neither farmers nor consumers benefit from government intervention.&#13;
Aaro-Processina&#13;
48.     - Agro-processing of certain products is controlled by issuance of&#13;
licenses. The control includes basic commodities, such as rice mill, flour&#13;
mill, sugar mill, edible oils, refined rice bran oil, processed food&#13;
industries including biscuits, bakery products etc,. Similarly, fruit and&#13;
vegetable processing requires a license whose application must be made on a&#13;
prescribed form, with a long waiting period for approval.&#13;
49.       The Essential Commodities Act even prescribes methods of&#13;
preparation of beverages from pulp or extraction of juices from fully ripe and&#13;
sound fruits, etc. Even when licenses are issued at relatively high fees,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
frequent government inspection discourages entrepreneurs from establishing&#13;
additional agro-processing units.&#13;

ASSAM-RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
RURAL ROADS&#13;
-  TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS FOR CONTRACT SUPERVISION&#13;
Background&#13;
1.        The Government of India has applied for a Loan/Credit from the&#13;
World Bank/IDA on behalf of the Government of Assam for a Rural Infrastructure&#13;
and Agricultural Services Project (RIASP). The project would replace with&#13;
permanent materials unserviceable timber bridges and the upgrade rural/village&#13;
roads where improved access would enhance development of the agriculture&#13;
sector in general and the mobility of the rural population.  In concentrating&#13;
in high potential areas of the state, the selection of roads was limited to&#13;
only six districts, including: Lakhimpur, Darrang, Nagaon, Sibsagar, Kamrup&#13;
and Cachar.  The roads concerned would be constructed in trenches to be&#13;
completed over eight-years.&#13;
2.        The roads are to be constructed to geometric and pavement standards&#13;
for rural roads as prescribed in the publications of the Indian Roads&#13;
Congress. Bridges for village roads with low traffic would be single lane in&#13;
permanent materials. The project also provides for the maintenance of these&#13;
roads and bridges during the project period.&#13;
3.        The road works are divided into separate contract packages for each&#13;
district each costing about Rs. 20 to 30 million. The works are to be awarded&#13;
on the basis of the World Bank's standard LCB document as agreed between the&#13;
Bank and GOI. As is now standard for World Bank-funded road works elsewhere&#13;
in India the contract works are to be supervised by a consultant appointed in&#13;
compliance with the World Bank's Guidelines for the Procurement of&#13;
Consultants' Services. The PWD may wish to second selected staff to work&#13;
under the consultant's authority to gain experience, but this would be a&#13;
matter for mutual agreement. Should the consultant be expatriate, it may be&#13;
useful for that firm to take into joint venture a local firm, knowledgeable in&#13;
Indian conditions.&#13;
Obiectives&#13;
4.        The objectives of contract supervision through consultant services&#13;
would be to:&#13;
(a) ensure that the conditions of contract and specifications of the&#13;
works are administered by personnel whose experience in all the&#13;
aspects of the contract works and administration has been assured&#13;

management constraints to production in the six agro climatic zones of the&#13;
state and 2. suggest appropriate technological packages and social action&#13;
process designed to enhance productive use and sustainability of the natural&#13;
resources.&#13;

2.        Rice based farming system is dominant in Assam.  Despite a&#13;
reasonably well distributed and high rainfall of about 2000 mm per year, quite&#13;
favorable for double cropping, the crop intensity in the state is low and per&#13;
Ha rice yield is poor just around 1000 Kgs/ha. Flooding, ill-drained&#13;
conditions, cloudy weather during main crop season, and poor agronomic&#13;
practices are attributed as chief causes for this poor performance.&#13;
3.        Rice yields are high during summer season. Potentials for better&#13;
land use through diversified cropping exist in summer. For expanding area&#13;
under cultivation during this favorable season supplementary irrigation is&#13;
required. But land-holdings in Assam are small, farmers are resource poor and&#13;
are not able to invest on supplementary irrigation facilities. Earlier&#13;
attempts by GOA in installing and operating Public tube-wells for irrigation&#13;
have not been successful. In a few cases farmers have come together&#13;
voluntarily, formed FMCs, installed tube-wells collectively and diversified&#13;
cropping successfully. Can this be repeated on a larger scale?&#13;
4.        Soils in Assam are generally acidic. Deficiency of minor elements&#13;
are widespread. Soil fertility is poor. Application of inorganic fertilizers&#13;
is pretty low; incorporation of organic manures is not practiced on any&#13;
significant scale. Added to this the seasonal rains remove and wash off the&#13;
top soil thereby depleting the soil fertility. This trend needs to be arrested&#13;
and reversed.&#13;
s.        Great potentials exist in the state for livestock, fisheries and&#13;
sericulture development. Efforts to diversify cropping, introduce viable&#13;
integrated farming systems and maximize natural resource use through a&#13;
technology package have not been adequate. To design and promote such changes&#13;
GOA has established Regional research stations, Field testing centers, soil&#13;
survey units and introduced broad based extension approach. Activities of&#13;
these organizations need to be coordinated and focussed towards securing&#13;
better results.&#13;
6.        In Assam land holdings are small and scattered. Pressure on land is&#13;
high. For efficient natural resource management besides individual enterprise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
collective group action is considered as critical. Local institution building&#13;
through formal as well as informal channels needs to be encouraged to promote&#13;
sustained natural resource management.&#13;
ADDroach:&#13;
7.        The study should address these issues, agro- climatic region-wise.&#13;
Specifically it should review:&#13;
(a) Land use pattern and farm budgees;&#13;
(bi Major problems on soil fertility, soil erosion, and water&#13;
management;&#13;
(c) Prevailing system for common land and other resources management;&#13;
(d) Status of soil survey and fertility mapping;&#13;
(e) Status of ground water survey;&#13;
Cf) Functions, effectiveness and contribution of the regional research&#13;
stations and field testing stations;&#13;
(g) Potentials for better land and water use;&#13;
(h) Grassroots institutions, both formal and informal, involved in&#13;
natural resource management and their effectiveness; and&#13;
(i) Public policies influencing soil and water management.&#13;
8.        On the basis of the review the study should propose a technology&#13;
package to improve soil fertility and water use management. It should also&#13;
suggest measures to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the public&#13;
institutions involved in technology generation and transfer.&#13;
9.        In addition the study should come out with a social action package&#13;
designed to implement the technological approach through close involvement of&#13;
the beneficiaries and their informal groups.&#13;
10.       Public policies which would need to be adjusted to assist&#13;
technology adoption and peoples involvement should also be pointed out.&#13;
11.       Draft findings of the study should be discussed in a seminar that&#13;
will be organized by the PD- PIU. Final report should take in view the&#13;
observations of the seminar and ten copies of it should be submitted to the PD&#13;
(PIU)&#13;
The duration of the study will be six months.&#13;

ASSAM-RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Marketine Study of High Value Crops&#13;
Terms of reference.&#13;
1.        This study is aimed at reviewing the constraints for marketing of&#13;
high value-crops in Assam and proposing possible policy, technological,&#13;
institutional and cost effective investment options for overcoming them.            -&#13;
Backgro=nd&#13;
2.        Rice based farming system is predominant in Assam. To promote&#13;
growth and to alleviate rural poverty it is considered essential to diversify, &#13;
farming and introduce on a significant scale growing of high value crops.&#13;
Potentials for growing high value crops of fruits, flowers, vegetables and&#13;
spices exist. But there is hardly any reliable estimates on the quantity and&#13;
trends in demand for these commodities within and outside the state to support&#13;
investments and developmental activities.&#13;
3.        Besides doubts exist on the viability of large scale investments on&#13;
high value crops due to perceived constraints on marketing. These constraints&#13;
include: predominance of small holder operation, constant threats from floods&#13;
and ill drained conditions, inadequacy of all weather roads, poor rural&#13;
storage facilities, far removed from other major market centers of the country&#13;
And thereby leading to higher transport costs and delays in delivery, inland&#13;
state with limited export potential, state movement restrictions and taxation&#13;
policies, and inadequate institutional support.&#13;
4.        A counter argument to the above listed constraints is advanced by&#13;
well informed groups that these constraints are overstated and a large volume&#13;
of tea grown in the state is moved out efficiently to competitive markets and&#13;
variety of materials from fish and eggs to large timber moves every day into&#13;
the state from within and outside the country. So it becomes essential to&#13;
carefully review the critical bottlenecks in marketing of high value crops and&#13;
design viable methods to overcome those.&#13;
Method&#13;
5.        The consultant should first select a set of high value crops in&#13;
which Assam has a perceived market advantage. The set of crops should then be&#13;
finalized in consultation with the PIU.&#13;
6.        In the next stage the demand and supply position and their trends&#13;
for these selected crops within the state and country and in international&#13;
markets both in volume and in monetary terms; potentials and viability for&#13;
expanding the production of these commodities in Assam; constraints of&#13;
technology, public policies, institutional and infrastructural inadequacies&#13;
including marketing affecting growth should be assessed. Data for this survey&#13;
should be gathered through primary and secondary sources and interview with&#13;
established interest groups of both producers and traders, policy makers and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66-&#13;
academicians.&#13;
7.        In the third stage viable options to overcome the perceived&#13;
constraints should be studied and analyzed. This analysis should result in&#13;
formulation of a matrix with specific suggestions for public policy and&#13;
institutional adjustments and broad indications on investments for promoting&#13;
crops with definite market advantage.&#13;
8.        The preliminary observations and suggestions should then be&#13;
presented for discussion in a select group of interested and involved people.&#13;
The PIU will organize this meeting.&#13;
9.        Benefitting from the group discussion a final report ( 6 copiesl-&#13;
should be prepared and presented to the PD-PIU.&#13;
The study should be completed in a period of six months from&#13;
assignment.&#13;

ASSAM-RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
AN INDICATIVE LIST OF ACTIVITIES/ISSUES TO BE&#13;
ADDRESSED IN CONSULTATIVE PLANNING&#13;
1.        Consultative planning would be carried out by implementing&#13;
departments and agencies with the assistance of NGOs, particularly for&#13;
activities which would lead to the creation or development of common assets.&#13;
This would include most irrigation activities, development of fisheries in&#13;
community ponds and wells, fodder development on common lands, and roads. The&#13;
intensity of consultative planning would be minimal for the shallow tube welr -&#13;
program. For roads, the consultative planning would be confined to planning&#13;
for afforestation or other appropriate activities on government lands along&#13;
the roadside, and maintenance of drainage works.&#13;
2.        The consultative planning would initially be flexible though&#13;
attempts would be made to have common procedures and sequencing implementation&#13;
of components. An indicative planning module consisting of five steps is&#13;
attached.  For the first three steps the details are component wise.  For the&#13;
last two steps, a common procedure is indicated, as by this time all the&#13;
details which vary from component to component, would have been discussed and&#13;
almost finalized. -&#13;
3.        If more than one activity is being taken up in the same village,&#13;
separate plans and MOUs would be prepared for each activity.  In such cases,&#13;
the consultative planning would have been done in a coordinated way.&#13;

ASSAM RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
GRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION OF NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS)&#13;
The project would seek NGO participation to assist in formation of Water&#13;
User Associations, Fishermen Societies and Farmers' Groups; farmer&#13;
mobilization, sensitization and training. GOA would invite from interested&#13;
NGOs detailed proposals for collaboration. The GOA would be responsible for&#13;
reviewing the proposals and agreeing on appropriate mechanisms to involve NoOs&#13;
in the project. The selection of NGOs would be guided by the following&#13;
criteria:&#13;
(a)  As part of legal requirements, the NGO should be a registered body&#13;
under the relevant State Law. It should have meticulous accounts&#13;
and properly audited annual scatements of income and expenditure.&#13;
(b)  Since the program involves working with farmers with diverse socio-&#13;
cultural backgrounds in an agrarian setting, it is essential that&#13;
the NGO has a rural orientation. To avoid creating any biases and&#13;
misconceptions in the minds of the people, the NGO should not be&#13;
affiliated to any political organization.&#13;
(c) As the project requires NGO support for farmer mobilization and&#13;
field level management of assets nd resources, the NGO should have&#13;
adequate number of field level staff conversant with the local&#13;
language and customs and having a clear understanding of the socio-&#13;
economic and political situation of the area.  They should also&#13;
have good rapport with the community so as to enthuse and involve&#13;
them in developmental activities wholeheartedly. This ability&#13;
should be reflected in some of the projects undertaken ny the NGO&#13;
earlier. Good communication skills are a requirement.&#13;
(d) A prior understanding of the matter under consideration, and&#13;
experience in WUA, Fisherman Associations and Farmers' groups&#13;
formation and interaction would be an added advantage. Owing to he&#13;
nature and extent of the physical coverage on the program each&#13;

should be able to interact smoothly with and be a part of he team.&#13;

ASSAM RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
IRRIGATION DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Simplified Procedures/Guidelines for Undertaking Rapid Feasibility Studies&#13;
Appropriate for the Development of Shallow Tube Wells&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Total number of shallow tube wells to be installed under the scheme will&#13;
be 15,000 in a 7 year period covering 18 districts in the state, benefitting&#13;
an area of 33,000 ha. District-wise distribution of STWs for implementation is&#13;
given in Table 1.&#13;
Simplified procedures for rapid feasibility studies&#13;
2.    Official records from the Chief Engineer (Agriculture) show that 19,618&#13;
Field Management Committees (FMCs) already exist in 214 blocks of the state.&#13;
The Agriculture Department should collect information from the FMCs in each&#13;
block, particularly on area cultivated, location, cropping/irrigation&#13;
intensity, farmer's location &amp; income levels, gender, presence of any other&#13;
organization in the location, FMCs overdue position, number of STWs in the&#13;
location and their performance.&#13;
3.    A 14 factor scoring method to be adopted using the collected information&#13;
to select potential FMCs or individual farmers for installing the STWs is&#13;
presented in Table 2. A cumulative score will be computed for each FMC or&#13;
farmer as the case may be. FMCs or farmers with higher scores will be given&#13;
priority for STW development over FMCs or farmers with lower scores.&#13;
.Imolementation&#13;
4.    Out of the 15,000 STWs, 90% will be developed through FMCs and 10% on&#13;
individual farmer basis. Once the FMCs are ranked based on the above set of&#13;
criteria, FMCs should be motivated to become formal associations by&#13;
registration under the Societies Act. Priority during implementation will&#13;
follow the order of registration of the FMCs.&#13;
5.    The Agriculture Department, with the existing infrastructure, will be&#13;
responsible for implementing the proposed STW schemes. Implementation should&#13;
be done through LCB and the Agriculture Department should supervise and&#13;
provide technical guidance. The FMCs should be involved in the civil works&#13;
related to STW installation.&#13;
6.    The STW program under this project should incorporate the existing STN&#13;
program being implemented by the Agriculture Department under the Conmunity&#13;
Irrigation Project (CIP)  in order to reduce the heavy subsidy inbuilt in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-122-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Attachment l&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
CIP. Because only about 5-10 percent of the FMCs are functioning and self&#13;
sustaining, NGOs should be engaged to strengthen the FMCs.  NGOs should also&#13;
assist in evolving methods for effective farmer participation in project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
7.    Since the role of women in farming is gaining increasing recognition in&#13;
the state, NGOs and FMCs should encourage women in STW investment. Wherever&#13;
women show interest, they should be given priority over men in selection and&#13;
implementation of the STWs program.&#13;
8.    Before the implementation of the STWs program, a Memorandum Of&#13;
Understanding (MOU) shall be executed by the concerned Secretary and President _&#13;
of the FMC and the Agriculture Department, in which the FMC assumes&#13;
responsibility over the STW scheme and cost recovery as per the conditions&#13;
stipulated by the Government. An amount equal to one-third of the total&#13;
investment for each STW is to be recovered from the beneficiaries in 4&#13;
installments where the first instalment is to be recovered before the&#13;
construction work starts.  The FMC should be responsible for cost recovery (in&#13;
cash or kind) on behalf of the implementing agency.  Labour contribution by&#13;
the beneficiary farmers during installation should be included in cost&#13;
recovery computation. The FMC can keep 1 percent of the amount collected as-&#13;
an incentive. In the case of defaulters, the pump sets to be taken back to the&#13;
Agriculture Department.&#13;
9.    In the case of farmer beneficiaries without an FMC, each beneficiary&#13;
farmer should sign an agreement with the implementing agency that he/she will&#13;
pay one third of the cost of the investment in 4 equal installments and should,&#13;
operate and maintain the STWs by himself/herself. In the case of defaulters,&#13;
the pump sets are to be repossessed by the Agriculture Department.&#13;
10.   Involvement of the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is recommended&#13;
which will take care of the ground water budget and spacing between the wells&#13;
in the selected locations. The Regional Directorate of the CGWB (Guwahati) is&#13;
already conducting detailed studies on recharge, spacing requirements etc..&#13;
11.   Once the selection of the STW sites and FMCs in all the districts is&#13;
completed by the Agriculture Department, then the CGWB (Guwahati) should be&#13;
consulted about the selection and its suggestions should be incorporated&#13;
appropriately before implementation. The technical guidelines as recommended&#13;
by the CGWB are to be considered while implementing the schemes.&#13;
Technical guidelines&#13;
12.   As per the general guidelines of the CGWB, normally a well assembly of&#13;
102 mm diameter with 6 to 15 m of slotted pipe of agricultural strainer made&#13;
up of galvanized iron pipe has to be lowered into a 150 mm diameter borehole.&#13;
The wells have to be shrouded with gravel of suitable size. In locations such&#13;
as north of Brahmaputra river covering northern parts of Goalpara, Kamrup,&#13;
Darrang and North Lakhimpur, twin-tube wells with a central pumping system&#13;
could be done instead of conventional boring due to bouldery formations even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

at shallow depths of 15 to 20 m below the surface.&#13;
13.   Pump efficiency is greatly affected by the pump head, hence proper head&#13;
should be maintained. For example, with a total head of 6.5 m, the-discharge&#13;
will be about 10 liters per second (lps), for 7.5 to 9.5 m, the discharge will&#13;
be about 8 lps and for 10 to 12 m head, the discharge will be about 6 lps.&#13;
Pumps should be installed in such a way that a minimum efficiency of 50 %&#13;
should be assured. Pumps for STWs should be placed at or near the surface.&#13;
14.   In the flood plains of the Brahmaputra valley, aquifers are extensive&#13;
and prolific with high transmissivity values. Normal spacing is taken as 200&#13;
m and in other areas such as north of the Brahmaputra river, the spacing is&#13;
taken as 300 m because of moderate transmissivity resulting in higher&#13;
drawdowns. In locations such as Silchar district which are characterized by&#13;
low transmissivity, STWs with low discharge design at selected locations which&#13;
could command only about 1 ha could be feasible.&#13;
15.   STW installation should be done with a combination of GI pipes and PVC&#13;
pipes. For example, for an STW with a depth of 30 meters, the combination will&#13;
be: 3 meter GI pipe, 17 meters PVC pipe and 10 meters iron cum HDP strainer.&#13;

IRRIGATION DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Selection Criteria and Guidelines for Rehabilitation of&#13;
Deep Tube Wells (DTWsI and River Pumping Schemes(RPSs)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The total number of DTWs and RPSs to be rehabilitated will be 320 and&#13;
150, respectively, in a 6 year period covering 23 districts in the state and&#13;
benefitting an area of 15,460 ha. Districtwise distribution of DTWs/RPSs for&#13;
implementation is given in Tables 1 and 2.&#13;
Selection Criteria for DTWs and RPSs for Rehabilitation&#13;
2.    There are three types of rehabilitation work that need to done: a)&#13;
installation of equipment on about 622 deep bores that were drilled by the&#13;
Irrigation Department but had not been fitted with pumpsets and other&#13;
equipment; b) repairing about 529 DTWs that are not in working condition due&#13;
to major break downs, and c) retrofitting with diesel pumps about 613 DTWs&#13;
that are partially utilized due to the intermittent supply of electricity.&#13;
3.    The Irrigation Department should collect information on the DTWs/RPS id&#13;
each category, such as location with respect to transport facilities and other&#13;
DTWs/RPSs, average electricity availability, age of the DTWs/RPSs, presence of&#13;
FMCs/other organizations, cropping intensity, overdue with FMCs, presence of&#13;
any other OTW/RPS scheme, presence of NGOs and performance of the DTWs/RPSs in&#13;
the location.&#13;
4.    An 11 factor scoring method will be adopted using the collected&#13;
information to select the potential DTW/RPS for rehabilitation (Table 3). A&#13;
cumulative score will be computed for each DTW/RPS. DTWs/RPSs with high&#13;
cumulative scores will be selected for rehabilitation.&#13;
I ementation&#13;
5.    The rehabilitation investment for 320 DTWs is to be distributed as&#13;
follows: 50% where only deep bores are available; 40 % where OTWs are not&#13;
working and 10% where DTWs are partially working. Once the OTWs are ranked in&#13;
each of the three categories based on the above set of criteria, farmer groups&#13;
or FMCs in each DTW location should be motivated to become formal water users&#13;
associations (WUA) by registration under the Societies Act. NGOs should be&#13;
engaged to strengthen the FMCs and evolve methods for effective farmer&#13;
participation in project implementation. The WUAs will be prioritized during&#13;
implementation based on the order in which they are formed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-128-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;

6.    The Irrigation Department (ID), with the existing infrastructure, will&#13;
be responsible for implementing the proposed DTW/RP schemes through LCB. ID&#13;
should do the supervision and monitoring of implementation.&#13;
7.    Before execution of the rehabilitation program, a MOU is to be executed&#13;
by the concerned Secretary and President of the WUA and the Irrigation&#13;
Department (ID) to undertake the rehabilitation as per the conditions&#13;
stipulated by the Government.&#13;
8.    The Chief Engineer (Distribution),  Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB)&#13;
had indicated that the total planned power requirement in the state will be&#13;
1785 million units/year and the share of irrigation sector will be about 37&#13;
million units/year ( 2 %). Currently, the ASEB is charging the Irrigation&#13;
Department for the supply of electricity to the DTWs/RPSs. Even though&#13;
farmers are expected to pay an irrigation cess to the Irrigation Department,&#13;
this has not been done in the last three years.&#13;
9.    The Irrigation Department's overdues to ASEB (as of November 1994)&#13;
amounted to about Rs 102 millions, and ASEB is reluctant to supply more&#13;
electricity to ID. About 30% of the overdues is attributed to the operation&#13;
of DTWs and 10% to RPSs. Further, power generation in the state is also highly&#13;
inadequate. ASEB is planning to increase power charges from the existing Rs&#13;
0.88 to Rs 1.60/unit in view of the high cost of generation which is about Rs&#13;
2.61 /unit.&#13;
10.   Revenue to the Irrigation Department through irrigation cess in the last&#13;
three years is negligible, as there was no water charge collection in the last'&#13;
three years. The Government of Assam issued notification in June 1992 to fix&#13;
Irrigation Service charges from the beneficiaries of all irrigation schemes.&#13;
The per hectare irrigation charges for Kharif crop is Rs 140.62, wheat Rs&#13;
281.25, Early Ahu and Ahu Rs 375.50. Total charges per annum will be Rs 797.37&#13;
per hectare.&#13;
11.   The operating cost per hectare per annum of using electric power is Rs&#13;
870 under STW, Rs 1550 under DTW, Rs 1258 under SLs, whereas the cost of using&#13;
diesel is Rs 1740, Rs 3560, and Rs 3200 respectively. In the case of&#13;
diversion schemes it is Rs 704. If the Irrigation Department's establishment&#13;
cost is included, the operating cost increases by another Rs 200 per hectare.&#13;
The running cost of pump sets varies from Rs 4.0/hr to Rs 7.5/hr for 5 and 10&#13;
HP motors, respectively, when using electric power. For the same HPs, the&#13;
cost varies from Rs 13.2/hr to Rs 19.8/hr when using diesel.&#13;
12.   Studies from Assam Agricultural University show that total water&#13;
requirement on per hectare basis for kharif(Sali) crops is about 21 cm,&#13;
early Ahu 98 cm and Ahu 49 cm. Taking into account the cropping intensity of&#13;
60% in Ahu, 30% in early Ahu and 80% in Sali, annual water requirement will be&#13;
128 cm/hectare.&#13;
13. OTIWs with electric power only have a cropping intensity of 56%, with the&#13;
average number of rice supplemental irrigations actually available per hectare&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-129-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Attachment 2&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
varying from 0 to 1 compared to the required 3 to 4 in Kharif.  In the Rabi&#13;
season, farmers need pump water in 85X of the crop period which could not be&#13;
possible with erratic electric power supplies. Since electric power is not&#13;
regularly available, farmers who could not get the water-in time from the DTW&#13;
fallow their land. If diesel source is available, then the cropping intensity&#13;
will increase to 175 % as two season cropping is possible with assured water&#13;
supplies.&#13;
14.   Crop budgets show farmers with erratic irrigation supplies could get a&#13;
net income of only Rs 1,176/ha compared to Rs 9867/ha per annum by farmers&#13;
with assured irrigation supplies, particularly in the DTWs/RPS.&#13;
15.   As part of the cost recovery effort, an amount equal to one-third of the&#13;
total investment for each DTW/RPS is to be recovered from the beneficiaries in&#13;
4 instalments where the first instalment is to be recovered before the works&#13;
start. The WUA should recover the cost either in cash or kind from the&#13;
beneficiaries on behalf of the Government. Labor contribution by the&#13;
beneficiary farmers during installation will be incorporated in the&#13;
computation of cost recovery requirements. The WUA can keep 1 percent of the&#13;
amount collected as an incentive. In the case of defaulters, the WUA should&#13;
stop providing irrigation water to defaulters.&#13;
16.   Wherever possible, the horse power (HP) of the diesel set should be&#13;
restricted to 25 HP which will facilitate buying and storing of diesel by the&#13;
WUA for regular pump operation.  -&#13;
17.   While rehabilitating the partially working OTWs, vertical turbine sets&#13;
to be replaced first, before submersible sets. After rehabilitation, the WUA&#13;
is responsible for payment of the relevant water charges to the ID and the ID&#13;
in turn is responsible for performing routine operation &amp; maintenance on the&#13;
DTWs/RPSs.&#13;
18.   Since the rehabilitated DTWs/RPS will be scattered across several&#13;
districts, proper monitoring of the rehabilitated DTWs/RPS should be done by&#13;
outside experts. Development of base line data for the rehabilitated as well&#13;
as other DTWs/RPSs is important and should be carried out.&#13;

IRRIGATION DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Handing Over Procedures for Rehabilitated DTWs/RPSs to&#13;
Water User Associations&#13;
1.    DTWs/RPSs will be rehabilitated after ascertaining that the&#13;
beneficiaries will assume full responsibility for managing and maintaining the&#13;
rehabilitated units. The services of the NGOs should be used to assess the&#13;
willingness of beneficiaries to form WUAs that are willing to take over the&#13;
units. The rehabilitated units will then be handed over to the WUAs for an&#13;
initial period of 10 years of operation and management. ID has already shown&#13;
the willingness for the handover. Government Order is to be issued to&#13;
facilitate the handover.&#13;
2.    A MOU would be signed between the WUA and the ID incorporating the&#13;
procedures, conditions and follow ups on the handover of the DTW/RPS to the&#13;
WUA. NGO participation is recommended for sustainability of the investment in&#13;
the long-run. Once a suitable NGO in each district is identified, then the&#13;
NGO should coordinate between the ID and the WUA so that the WUA will be fully&#13;
aware of the consequences of such a handover.&#13;
3.    The MOU should include the following WUA primarily responsibilities:&#13;
- maintaining audited accounts of DTWs/RPSs,&#13;
- maintaining linkages with NGOs and government departments,&#13;
- providing diesel regularly for running the OTWs/RPSs,&#13;
- operating &amp; maintaining the units,&#13;
- distributing water and resolving conflicts among members,&#13;
- paying electricity charges due to OTW operation directly to the Assam&#13;
State Electricity Board (ASEB),&#13;
- mobilizing its own resources for repairs &amp; maintenance&#13;
through collection of fees from members and other income&#13;
generating activities.&#13;
To facilitate the handover process, legal aspects should be worked out after&#13;
ponsulting the legal experts.&#13;

IRRIGATION DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION-&#13;
Selection Criteria and Guidelines for Establishing                     -&#13;
Pilot Tank Irriaation Systems&#13;
IntroductJan&#13;
1.    The proposal recommends 5 pilot tanik irrigation projects to 'irrigate-&#13;
about 100 ha. The distribution as well as implementation schedule of the&#13;
projects is given in Table l.&#13;
Gu1eliesfor Selection/Implementation of Schemes&#13;
2.    Tank sites proposed under the pilot project should be cleared by the&#13;
state government, and it should ascertained that there are no local&#13;
conflicting issues involved.  Since the success of the tank systems is             -&#13;
primarily based on the rainfall pattern, catchment behavior, water spread area&#13;
and command area, survey of the selected locations should be done and the&#13;
topographical map depicting cadastral information and boundaries of the tank&#13;
system be prepared for each location by the Irrigation Department.&#13;
3.    In each location, simple reconnaissance soil survey  and land&#13;
classification should be done so that the suitability of the water spread area&#13;
and command area for water storage and crop growing is known. Based on this&#13;
information, the suitability of the location for tank irrigation should be&#13;
assessed.&#13;
4.    The rainfall data pattern in the location should be analyzed using&#13;
available time series data for the last lO years in order to work out run-off&#13;
behavior. Since the pilot projects will be taken up after the 3rd year of the&#13;
project, rain gauges should be installed in the first year of the project&#13;
itself in the catchment area to know exactly the relationship between rainfall&#13;
and run-off patterns.&#13;
S.    Run-off models should be developed using either Strange's table or using&#13;
available computer models suitable to Assam conditions. Based on this&#13;
information, tank storage capacity, size of the water spread area, number of&#13;
fillings, and size of command area should be worked out.&#13;
6.    Based on the duration of water supply and crop water requilrement, the&#13;
size of the command area should be worked out taking into account the&#13;
prevailing crop pattern in the locat10n.. Since the tanks are pilot in nature,-&#13;
the size of the command area should be restricted to around 20 hectares per&#13;
tank.&#13;
&#13;

7.    One Superintending Engineer, two Assistant Engineers and five  junior&#13;
engineers will be given training in tank irrigation design and construction&#13;
methodalogies. Before starting the work, they should visit Irrigation&#13;
Departments in some of the Southern states like Andhra Pradesh or Karnataka or&#13;
Tamil Nadu where tank irrigation is popular.&#13;
8.    A two week training, particularly in the first year of project&#13;
implementation, should be given to selected engineers by tank irrigation&#13;
experts. The training should focus primarily on:&#13;
- tank hydrology,&#13;
- catchment treatment,&#13;
- irrigation methods,&#13;
- conjunctive use of tank and well water,&#13;
- farmer participation,&#13;
- tank rehabilitation, and&#13;
- overall tank management.&#13;
9.    The Irrigation Department should maintain the tank water spread area and&#13;
sluices. Since this is on a pilot basis, the engineers should monitor the&#13;
catchment and tank storage behavior periodically so that the design could be&#13;
improved in other locations.&#13;
10.   Farmers in the tank command area should be motivated to form a WUA and&#13;
they should be given training in tank irrigation methods.  ID should closely&#13;
work with the farmers for the first two years of tank irrigation. Farmers&#13;
should be trained to maintain the canals and field channels by themselves.&#13;

IRRIGATION OESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Frameworks. Policies. Strategies and Agoroaches for the&#13;
Farmer Particigatory Program&#13;
1.    The following factors are likely to have a positive relationship on the&#13;
willingness of water users to organize themselves and contribute towards the&#13;
cost of rehabilitation and subsequent O&amp;M:&#13;
- the relative non-reliability of electric supply in the location,&#13;
-  the potential gains through increased paddy yield or due to second crop&#13;
cultivation,&#13;
- the presence of a strong leadership in the project area, and&#13;
- the presence, in the area, of a strong NGO with experience in community&#13;
organization activities.&#13;
2.    Each DTW or RPS to be rehabilitated should have a registered WUA even&#13;
before starting the rehabilitation process. The WUA to be formed is sought to&#13;
be entrusted with the functions such as:&#13;
- equitable water distribution and conflict resolution,&#13;
- enforcement of water allocation and distribution policies,&#13;
- payment of electricity dues,&#13;
- improvement of agricultural production by adopting modern agronomic&#13;
practices,&#13;
- coordination with other agencies to enable the farmers to get essential&#13;
inputs like diesel, seeds, fertilizers and manures, and loans in time,&#13;
and&#13;
- generation of revolving funds to undertake regular operation and&#13;
maintenance works.&#13;
3.    To facilitate people's participation and cost-sharing by the&#13;
beneficiaries, the principle of 'First Come First Served" should be made the&#13;
norm for starting the rehabilitation process at proposed locations. The&#13;
process of forming registered WUAs and planning the rehabilitation programs&#13;
should be started simultaneously in all the locations where rehabilitation&#13;
works are proposed. Farmers who are first to complete the formalities of&#13;
forming a registered WUA will be taken up first during implementation, and the&#13;
rest in that order.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Paae 2 of 4&#13;
4.    A select number of NGOs will be engaged for assisting the beneficiaries&#13;
to organize themselves as WUAs. A planning workshop with Irrigation&#13;
Department officials and NGOs representing-different regions in the state&#13;
should be organized before implementation. The main objectives of the&#13;
workshop should be to:&#13;
-  finalize a simple participatory planning methodology;&#13;
- draft proforma Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) to be signed between WUA&#13;
and ID;&#13;
- finalize the criteria, modalities and norms for NGO participation in the&#13;
rehabilitation program;&#13;
-  finalize cost sharing modalities which will include one third of the             -&#13;
total costs by beneficiaries, at least a quarter of which should be in&#13;
paid in cash before the project implementation begins and the reminder&#13;
in cash or kind after the scheme is implemented;&#13;
- work out the O&amp;M responsibilities of the WUA and the manner in which it&#13;
proposes to meet them, including the proposal for financial mobilization&#13;
for the same;&#13;
- work out the responsibilities of ID during project implementation and&#13;
after the rehabilitation has been completed.&#13;
5.    The NGO's function should also include providing assistance, for a&#13;
specified period, in mobilizing beneficiary contribution towards installation&#13;
costs as well as O&amp;M. While selecting these NGOs weight should be given to&#13;
the following factors:&#13;
- legal status,&#13;
- period of active presence in the area,&#13;
- existing infrastructure,&#13;
- experience in community organization activities,&#13;
- experience in working closely with the government,&#13;
- acceptability by the beneficiary group, and&#13;
-  financial requirement of the NGOs.&#13;
6.    Prior to inviting proposals from NGOs for participation in project&#13;
activities, the Agricultural Commissioner should set up the financial norms&#13;
for facilitating NGO participation. This should be based on actual&#13;
requirements in terms of labor needs, cost of extension activities and travel&#13;
and administrative costs which would be necessary for the designated&#13;
functions. The concept of a full time staff presence in the project areas&#13;
should be discouraged as it would tend to suppress the initiative of the WUA&#13;
leaders.&#13;
7.    There should be a Steering Committee at the state level to monitor the&#13;
progress of work with the Agricultural Commissioner as the chairperson and the&#13;
Irrigation Secretary as the convener. Members should include the Chief&#13;
Engineer(MI), consultants and NGO representatives.&#13;
8.    The should be a set of monitorable indicators to be used during&#13;
implementation to assess technical, economic and social progress. Primarily&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-139-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Attachment .&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
these indicators should include:&#13;
--physical targets and achievements,&#13;
- financial targets and achievements,&#13;
- level of farmer contribution,&#13;
- level of farmer payment towards electricity consumption,&#13;
- strength of WUA(in terms of number, capital &amp; meetings),&#13;
- strength of NGO(in terms of number and work load),&#13;
- level of WUA and ID coordination,&#13;
- change in crop production practices, and&#13;
- other infrastructure development/programs in the village.&#13;
9.    A training program to the farmers should be conducted. The beneficiaries&#13;
of the rehabilitated schemes must be trained so as to operate and manage the&#13;
schemes and meet the running costs. As the WUAs would be registered under the&#13;
Societies Act, proper training in accounting and other technical aspects&#13;
should be given.&#13;
10.   The WUA accounts are formal and open to audit. Proper accounting is a&#13;
must for the successful functioning of a WUA. A week's special training in&#13;
accounting procedures/book keeping and water distribution methods shall be&#13;
arranged for office bearers of each WUA prior to rehabilitation by the ID each&#13;
year.&#13;
11.   Further, a general training camp to be organized on the project site by&#13;
the ID about the scheme operation and crop production using training aids like&#13;
posters, slides and television. Further, selected pump operators of the WUA&#13;
would be offered a 2 day special training about pump repair and maintenance by&#13;
the mechanical wing of the ID.&#13;
12.   The syllabi for WUA training should include:&#13;
- history of farmer participation,&#13;
- participatory approach,&#13;
- benefits due to farmer participation,&#13;
- legal and administrative control of the WUA,&#13;
- relationship and responsibilities between ID and WUA,&#13;
- elementary management techniques,&#13;
- latest crop production/irrigation techniques,&#13;
- water saving methods,&#13;
- pump efficiencies,&#13;
- on-farm development activities,&#13;
- OE&amp; of the project,&#13;
- cost recovery, and&#13;
- marketing of produce.&#13;
NGOs like Technology and Environment(ACTSE) or Rashtriya Grameen Vikas Nidhi&#13;
(RGVN) could assist in organizing training and workshops.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ASSAM RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Economic and Financial Analyses&#13;
1.    Overview.  The project would adopt a holistic approach to development&#13;
through investments in irrigation infrastructure to enable greater returns in&#13;
agricultural activities, rural roads to foster commerce and mobility, -_&#13;
horticulture to increase returns from marginal land, livestock to increase its&#13;
productivity, and fisheries to increase the annual catch. Specifically,&#13;
irrigation on about 49,000 ha of land would be enabled/upgraded; about 1,400&#13;
km of rural roads and 282 bridges would be constructed or upgraded; some&#13;
960,000 indigenous animals would be artificially inseminated annually, and&#13;
about 6,000 ha of water would be developed for fisheries.&#13;
2.    Financial Analysis.  Table 23 shows the land holding pattern in the&#13;
state of Assam. Holdings tend to be small with almost 60% of the farmers&#13;
owning less than one ha of land; about 83% of the farmers in Assam till less&#13;
than 2 ha. Tables 19-21 summarize the projected impact of the project on&#13;
these farmers and their families. Without the project, these farmers would&#13;
continue to produce principally kharif crops dominated by paddy at relatively&#13;
low yields. With the project, irrigation and road infrastructure would&#13;
facilitate greater cropping intensity and yields with diversification into&#13;
higher value crops like peas, mustard, as well as a variety of summer and&#13;
winter vegetables. Three farm models have been developed (0.4, 0.8 and 1.5&#13;
ha). The smallest farmers would increase net family incomes by about 72% (Rs&#13;
4,000 to 6,880); medium-sized farmers would achieve increases of about 8S% (Rs&#13;
6,780 to 12,155); and larger growers would derive net family income increases&#13;
of about 83% (Rs 12,366 to 22,605) with the project. It is anticipated that&#13;
such income growth would be achieved over an eight-year period from access to'&#13;
improved irrigation water. Through project activities, about 2.25 million&#13;
additional mandays of agricultural labor would be created annually, 75t of&#13;
which would be in irrigated crops. In addition, the multiplier effect of the&#13;
project is expected to be considerable as the general economy of the area&#13;
improves, thereby generating additional, though unquantifiable, unemployment&#13;
opportunities and benefits. Incremental production generated with the project&#13;
as well as incremental employment is summarized in Table 22. The project&#13;
would also enable farmers operating 0.25 ha fish ponds to obtain a net return&#13;
of Rs. 4,500 per annum (Table 28), whereas a 2 ha community fish pond would'&#13;
net its operators at least Rs. 36,000 per annum, and a 100 ha beel, Rs.&#13;
398,000 per annum (Table 30). The cross-breeding program would enable a&#13;
farmer with only one cross-bred cow to obtain a net income of Rs. 5,400 as&#13;
opposed to Rs. 1050 for an indigenous cow (Table 31).&#13;
3.    Economic Analysis.  The economic life of the project was assumed to be&#13;
30 years in view of the longer-term nature of project investments. The&#13;
economic analysis of the project was done in constant end 1994 prices using&#13;
August 1994 world market commodity price projections. This analysis examined&#13;
five types of project investments--irrigation, rural roads, livestock,&#13;
fisheries, and horticulture.  No evaluation was done for the research and&#13;
extension activities because of the difficulties in quantifying the associated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-143-&#13;
benefits. Similarly no separate analysis was done for the land consolidation&#13;
activity because of its pilot nature and small size; however, the economic&#13;
analysis of with-project crop activities captured the increased value of&#13;
improved seed, reflecting higher quality and higher processing and storage&#13;
costs.- Economic costs were derived from the project's detailed cost tables&#13;
(Annex 5, Tables 1-5), excluding taxes and duties and price contingencies.&#13;
Costs of overall project implementation administration were apportioned to the&#13;
five investment activities analyzed based on each's contribution to base&#13;
costs. All local costs and non-tradeables (constant 1994 market prices for&#13;
milk, fish and fruits and vegetables) were converted to boarder prices by&#13;
using a standard conversion factor of 0.9. Vehicles and machinery were&#13;
assumed replaced every five years. As regards tradeable commodities, import&#13;
parity prices have been calculated on the assumptions that foodgrain&#13;
production would continue to stagnate and that India will be a marginal&#13;
importer of both grains and fertilizers. Financial and economic prices used&#13;
in project analyses are given in Tables 25 and 26. The economic cash flows&#13;
for the five analyzed investments and for the total project are given in Table&#13;
4.    Benefits of the irrigation component of the project would be derived&#13;
from increased cropping intensity, higher yields, and a switch to higher value&#13;
commodities, particularly vegetables, made marketable through a revamped rural&#13;
road infrastructure. Full production would be achieved in Year 12 of the&#13;
project, reflecting both the construction of project works (eight years) and&#13;
the gradual build-up rate of incremental yields and intensity (four years).&#13;
Estimates of incremental crop benefits and costs from irrigation were made&#13;
based on with and without project cropping patterns for irrigation in  Tables&#13;
19-21, and individual crop budgets given in Tables 1-18. The irrigation&#13;
component is expected to yield an economic rate of return (ERR) of about S7%.&#13;
5.    Project roads are expected to invigorate significantly the economy of&#13;
the project area by enabling access to agricultural inputs and marketing of&#13;
outputs, increased access to health facilities, administrative services,&#13;
education and off-farm employment, as well as a general opening up of the&#13;
area. Economic analyses of roads have generally assumed a number of&#13;
indicators to value benefits, including savings in costs of operation of&#13;
vehicles as a result of saved travel time. Table 27 sets out the three&#13;
benefits quantified for the analysis. As presented therein, a traffic pattern&#13;
has been estimated for a typical project road and from this, operating cost&#13;
savings, increased productive labor and increased productive use of vehlicles&#13;
were calculated. Each of these benefits were estimated on an annual per km&#13;
basis and expanded using the projected implementation schedule for road&#13;
construction. To accommodate likely increase in area traffic as the project&#13;
is implemented and the area economy is stimulated, traffic was assumed to rise&#13;
by St p.a. over ten years after construction of a given road. Because project&#13;
roads would benefit sectors other than agriculture (e.g., health, education,&#13;
public administration), only 50% of economic capital and recurrent road costs&#13;
were included in the economic analysis. 8ased on these calculations, the&#13;
component's ERR was calculated at 33%. All other road benefits were&#13;
considered to be non-quantifiable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-144-&#13;
6.    Under the livestock component, crossing of indigenous cattle with exotic&#13;
semen will increase production and reproduction potential of the herd,&#13;
resulting in increased milk and meat production. Incremental milk production&#13;
is expected to begin in the fifth year of the project, and stabilize in the&#13;
thirteenth year (Table 32). The ERR of this component is estimated at 21t.&#13;
7.    Improved fisheries management, and regular stocking of farmers, ponds,&#13;
community ponds, and beels will increase fish production to 2,000-3,000 kg of&#13;
fish/ha/year in farmers' and community ponds, and 300 kg/ha/year in beels. A&#13;
combined total water surface of 6,000 ha will be brought under fish&#13;
production, yielding 3,000 tons per year. Based on benefits and costs for&#13;
fish rearing in Tables 28-30, the fisheries component is expected to yield an&#13;
ERR of 22%.&#13;
8.    Increased horticulture production would improve farmers' nutrition in&#13;
addition to enhancing their disposal income. Estimates of incremental crop&#13;
benefits were based on crop budgets in Tables 8-18. Due to the eight year&#13;
phasing of investments, and the differing maturity of horticultural crops,&#13;
ranging from one to eight years, full production is expected around the&#13;
sixteenth year of the project. The component's ERR was estimated at 66%.&#13;
9.    The economic analysis for the entire project required an aggregation of&#13;
the cost and benefit streams for the five components discussed above. This&#13;
process yielded a weighted average ERR for the total project of 24% and an&#13;
aggregate NPV of Rs 2,423 million (US$ 78 million).&#13;
10.   Sensitivity Analysis.  Switching values were calculated on the total&#13;
project cost and benefit streams. According to this analysis, benefits would&#13;
need to drop by 50% or costs increase by 110% to reduce the ERR to the&#13;
Opportunity Cost of Capital of 12% (or the NPW to 0). Both of these scenarios&#13;
are considered highly unlikely. Arbitrary increases in costs and decreases in&#13;
benefits were also done as follows to test the sensitivity of the base ERR and&#13;
NPW:&#13;
ERR                NPV&#13;
(Rs. M)&#13;
Base Case                                   24%                2,423&#13;
Benefits down 10%                           22t                1,946&#13;
Benefits down 15%                           21t                1,707&#13;
Costs up 10%                                22%                2,188&#13;
Benefits lagged 2 years                     18t                1,381&#13;
Benefits down 10 and Costs up 10%          20%                1,711&#13;
These results suggest that the project's ERR is relatively robust when&#13;
subjected to serious benefit shortfalls and cost escalation. The conservative&#13;
nature of benefit estimations and delay-avoidance measures built into the&#13;
project's design reinforce confidence in results (para 10).&#13;
11.   Risks.  Despite the relatively weak management of government departments&#13;
in Assam, the project includes a number of innovations to increase chances of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-145-&#13;
project success. The project has been designed to minimize government&#13;
involvement. User groups would be involved actively in project planning,&#13;
implementation, evaluation and importantly, ownership and maintenance of&#13;
project facilities. This is expected to instill a sense of beneficiary&#13;
responsibility in the decision-making and asset-upkeep processes. Budget&#13;
clearance procedures and expenditure authorizations have been streamlined to&#13;
avoid delays. Incremental yields and build-up have been relatively&#13;
conservatively estimated; and, as discussed above, only quantifiable benefits&#13;
have been included, suggesting that actual net returns to project investments.&#13;
would be higher than estimated.&#13;

Annex 13&#13;
ASSAM RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Imnlementation Arrangements for Individual Components&#13;
Poverty Alleviation Comnonent&#13;
1.        Because the component includes distinct programs for improvement of&#13;
production technology in fisheries, livestock and horticulture, each of them&#13;
would be implemented by separate responsible line departments and agencies.&#13;
The improvement program for fisheries would be implemented by the Department&#13;
of Fisheries, Assam Fisheries Corporation, Fisheries cooperatives, Field&#13;
Management Committees and farmers. While livestock activities would be&#13;
implemented by the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department, private&#13;
entrepreneurs and farmers; and horticultural activities by the Department of&#13;
Agriculture (Horticulture Section), private seeds and seedlings producers,&#13;
Field Management Committees and farmers.&#13;
2.        Fisheries Development. Activities supported under the project&#13;
include seed production, mobile health units, farmers ponds and community&#13;
tanks, and fish production in laige reservoirs (beels). Also the project&#13;
would support Pilot open water, minor floodplain fisheries enhancement&#13;
activities. These activities would be implemented as follows:&#13;
(a) Fish Seed Production. The State Department of Fisheries through&#13;
its technically qualified persons and fisheries scientists of Assam&#13;
Agricultural University would initiate the establishment of eco-&#13;
hatcheries, one in each district, to demonstrate the scientific&#13;
method of fish breeding, rearing and distribution to the fish seed&#13;
growers of the State. Whenever the eco-hatcheries are leased to&#13;
private persons on a long-term basis, the department would monitor&#13;
their activities to ensure quality of seed is maintained. The Fish&#13;
Farmers Development Agencies (FFDAs) would be actively involved in&#13;
providing support in training, implementation and monitoring of the&#13;
program.&#13;
(b) Mobile Fish Health Units. These units would be operated by the&#13;
State Department of Fisheries through its Fish Farmers Development&#13;
Agencies located in selected high fish potential districts.&#13;
(c) Farmers Ponds. and Community Tanks. The potential areas for&#13;
creating ponds and tanks would jointly be identified by the State&#13;
Department of Fisheries and local bodies consisting of members of&#13;
Field Management Committees, Non-Governmental organizations,&#13;
Village Panchayats, etc. The Department, through Fish Farmers&#13;
Development Agencies, would guide and assist producers in intensive&#13;
fish culture production. The Departmental officials would also&#13;
monitor implementation and evaluate the impact of fish production&#13;
in the local economy, including income and employment generation.&#13;
(d) Pilot open water, minor floodplain fisheries enhancement. The&#13;
innovative strategy for this component would require coordination&#13;
by the Department of Fisheries (DOF) for all technical and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-187-&#13;
production monitoring aspects in conjunction with the Irrigation&#13;
Department (I)) for the engineering aspects and NGO to assist with&#13;
social organization of the fishing groups that would lease the open&#13;
waters. The DOF, with assistance from the ID, would be responsible&#13;
for implementing the engineering works which would include (i)&#13;
clearing and deepening channels between the selected floodplain and&#13;
rivers; (ii) replacement of irrigation gates with structures more&#13;
suitable for fish migration, as needed; and (iii) clearing of&#13;
floating aquatic vegetation. The DOF would make contractual&#13;
agreements with the participating fishing groups that would include&#13;
payment of 30% of investment costs and annual maintenance needs.&#13;
Responsibility for the latter would be taken directly by the&#13;
fishing groups in lieu of making payments for maintenance needs.&#13;
The DOF would be responsible for maintenance and production&#13;
monitoring and collection of baseline data at proposed sites prior&#13;
to making investments. The DOF would also review, revise , and&#13;
enforce fisheries regulations, as necessary, to optimize fish&#13;
production in the project area.&#13;
3.        The Department of Fisheries is adequately staffed with more than 30&#13;
qualified Junior Engineers to undertake survey work, demarcation of boundaries&#13;
and help to design embankments/dikes/spill-overs/sluice gates, etc. to be&#13;
contracted out. Weed clearing of beels would also be contracted out to the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
4.        Other activities such as Fisheries research, Extension service and&#13;
training would be centralized for implementation. The Assam Agricultural&#13;
University would implement fisheries research and the Department of&#13;
Agriculture would provide extension service under the broad based extension&#13;
service program. However, the responsibility for providing back stopping for&#13;
extension service would remain with the Department of Fisheries through its&#13;
SMSs in fisheries. The development of fisheries research projects would be&#13;
undertaken by the university scientists, seed growers, fish culturists, in&#13;
collaboration with staff at the Regional Research Center at Jorhat and ICAR&#13;
5.        A systematic ecological survey would be carried out of the wetlands&#13;
in the project area and identify ecologically important wetlands prior to&#13;
making investments. Such wetlands would be excluded from the prbject. So&#13;
far, six wetlands have been identified in Assam to be of international&#13;
importance and in need of protection. These are: (a) Sareswar in Dhuri&#13;
Division; (b) Wetlands in Manas Wildlife Sanctuary; (c) Dipor (Deepar); (d)&#13;
Wetlands in Loakhawa, Orang and Sonai Rupai Sanctuaries; (e) Wetlands in&#13;
Kaziranga National Park; and (f) Dibru Flood Plain.&#13;
6.        Because of the technical nature of fish production in large beels,&#13;
the Department of Fisheries would at the initial stage launch the operation by&#13;
designing, drawing, floating tenders for construction, supervising&#13;
construction and seeding before finally leasing to the private sector (highest&#13;
bidders). To promote private sector involvement in fish production on a&#13;
commercial scale, lease periods of water beels under government control would&#13;
be extended to 5-10 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-188-&#13;
7.        Beels would continue to be the major source of fish production in&#13;
the State, therefore there is a need to rationalize the States policy and&#13;
responsibility for their development. At present the majority of the beels&#13;
are either under the control of Revenue or Forestry Departments. For proper&#13;
development of beels the fishing rights should be vested with the State&#13;
Fisheries Department. Regarding the issue of leasing out large beels to&#13;
highest bidders, present users would be protected. A compensation package&#13;
acceptable to IDA would be required as an integral part of the beel&#13;
construction, in the annual work plan.&#13;
8.        Livestock Development.  The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary&#13;
Department (AHVD) is responsible for development of livestock in the state.&#13;
The Department is represented in each district by a District Veterinary&#13;
Officer under whom are a number of Sub-District Veterinary Officers,&#13;
Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, and Veterinary Extension Officers at the&#13;
livestock clinics, including mobile clinics. Currently the department has&#13;
several livestock improvement initiatives including, improvement of cattle,&#13;
buffalo, goats, pigs, ducks and poultry through breeding programs; the&#13;
Intensive Cattle Development Project (ICDP), village level scheme, and&#13;
production of frozen cattle semen for Artificial Insemination, as part of the&#13;
cattle improvement program.&#13;
9.        The cattle improvement program puts emphasis on dairy production&#13;
through its eight cattle farms and numerous insemination centers. The largest&#13;
program being the GOI supported ICDP scheme which started in 1968. The&#13;
objective of the ICDP is to improve milk production in the state through&#13;
controlled breeding, and improved feeding, management and disease control.&#13;
There are 11 ICDPs currently operating in the state and a further two were&#13;
planned and the infrastructure established but not implemented.&#13;
10.       To compliment GOI/GOA effort, additional resources provided under&#13;
the project would enable AHVD implement the cattle improvement program.&#13;
Because GOA under the ICDP has artificial insemination infrastructure in place&#13;
through which AI and veterinary services and animal husbandry information are&#13;
extended, the department would be supported to expand the coverage. The ICDPs&#13;
are linked with the Dairy Development Department and a Rural Development and&#13;
Extension Officer is attached to the ICDPs for household dairy extension, and&#13;
organizing cooperative societies for milk marketing. Animal management&#13;
practices of the ICDPs including castration of local bulls, breeding local&#13;
cows with frozen Jersey semen to produce cross bred milk animals, treatment of&#13;
animal health problems and prophylaxis for diseases, would be continued.&#13;
11.       The existing staff are adequate to implement the project, with the&#13;
exception of a few additional positions. At the state level, the staff would&#13;
consist of the Director, supported by an Additional Director who would be&#13;
responsible for the project. Below the Additional Director are a number of&#13;
SMSs whose function would be to train field level staff, assist with&#13;
beneficiary training, prepare training materials in their specialized subjects&#13;
with the assistance of the existing multi-media team. Also, SMSs would&#13;
organize and supervise field livestock development staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-189-&#13;
12.       Though most of the positions are filled, about 10% additional&#13;
staffing would be required. The existing lower level staff include the&#13;
following specializations: (i) fodder development, (ii) cattle production,&#13;
(iii) pig, sheep and goat production, (iv) training, (v) extension, and (vi)&#13;
animal health. Female staff for extension, women in development and animal&#13;
nutrition would be added to the existing contingent of livestock experts.&#13;
Additionally, some of the present staff would be re-trained to equip them in&#13;
livestock breeding, monitoring, credit and business development and planning.&#13;
There will also be a separate group responsible for frozen semen production&#13;
and management, epidemiology and disease monitoring.&#13;
13.       At the district level, each district would be headed by Veterinary&#13;
Officer supported by a team of SMSs to provide technical support for topics&#13;
which are important in that particular district. These would include:&#13;
training, cattle production, fodder development, pig, sheep and goat&#13;
production, animal health, and rural development and extension.&#13;
14.       The veterinary clinics and AI centers would continue to be operated&#13;
by existing staff carrying out general functions, acting as the extension&#13;
agents for livestock department, interacting with the beneficiaries and&#13;
passing requests for training and additional information to the SMSs at the&#13;
district level. With the development of VLAs and privatization of veterinary&#13;
services, Al centers would concentrate in providing technical support to the&#13;
private sector, monitoring, and private sector and farmer training and&#13;
extension. Sub-sector representation would be provided by the Veterinary&#13;
Extension Officer at the Block level.&#13;
15.       Horticulture Development.  Implementation of two IDA assisted&#13;
projects (Cr 728 and Cr 1754) has resulted in strengthening and streamlining&#13;
of the extension service under a single line of command. Under this system,&#13;
there is one VLEW for every 800 farm families, one AEO circle for 6-8 VLEWs,&#13;
one Sub-divisional Agricultural Officer for 6-8 AEO circles, one District&#13;
Agricultural Officer for 2-3 subdivisions, one Joint Director of Agriculture&#13;
for 2-4 districts. Because the proposed project would introduce a broad-based&#13;
extension service, the existing VLEWs would function as multiple change agents&#13;
for technology transfer for crops (including horticulture) and livestock.&#13;
16.       Because of the growing importance of horticulture as a source of&#13;
income and nutrition for the rural poor, a separate cell for horticulture was&#13;
created within the Department of Agriculture in 1992. The cell is headed by&#13;
an ADA (Horticulture) who is assisted by two Deputy Directors (Horticulture)&#13;
at headquarter. At the sub divisional level, the Sub divisional Agricultural&#13;
Officers are assisted by one SMS (Horticulture). At the state level workshops&#13;
exclusively for horticulture are held once every year since 1990-91 to promote&#13;
further expansion of horticulture.&#13;
17.       Also, bi-monthly zonal workshops devote about 50% of the time for&#13;
skill development and generation of messages on horticulture. The Department&#13;
of Agriculture and the Assam Agricultural University have jointly published&#13;
an excellent book entitled "Packages of Practices for Horticultural crops in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-190-&#13;
Assam" which is only useful to a few english speaking farmers. Assistance&#13;
would be provided in the project to translate the book into Assamese and&#13;
Bengali to be widely distributed to the farming community.&#13;
18.       There are about 3000 VLEWs in the Directorate of Agriculture.  Each&#13;
VLEW would conduct one or two horticultural demonstrations per year on&#13;
farmers' plots. Where FMCs are well organized the demonstrations would be&#13;
conducted through FMCs on selected farmers' land or on community lands.&#13;
Although about 20,000 FMCs have been registered, only a small percentage are&#13;
functioning and are self-sustaining. NGOs would be engaged to strengthen the&#13;
FMCs and to evolve methods for effective participation of beneficiary groups&#13;
in planning and implementation of demonstrations. The progeny orchard&#13;
activities would be implemented by the existing staff and the horticultural&#13;
training would be organized by sub-divisional SMS (Horticulture) supervised by&#13;
headquarter staff.&#13;
Institutional Development ComDonent&#13;
19.       The component includes technology generation, education and&#13;
training, extension service, seed multiplication and land administration whose&#13;
implementation would involve three agencies. These activities would be&#13;
implemented as follows:&#13;
20.       Technology Generation.  The Assam State Agricultural University&#13;
(ASAU) is responsible for agricultural research. Technology generation under&#13;
the project would concentrate on the development of various forms of the rice-&#13;
based cropping systems, to increase crop yields and also cropping intensity.&#13;
As a result of research supported through the Indian Council for Agricultural&#13;
Research (ICAR) all India coordinated trials, extension information is already&#13;
available for increasing the intensity of cropping under both irrigated and&#13;
dry-land cropping.&#13;
21.       The regional agricultural stations, strengthened under the project,&#13;
would be responsible for the location specific research. Since a major thrust&#13;
of the project is to widen the range of on-farm income generating activities,&#13;
an integrated approach to farming would be adopted to include crops, livestock&#13;
and fisheries. The rationale for supporting such effort&#13;
would be to ensure continued supply of demand driven technology, especially&#13;
more relevant to mixed farming.&#13;
22.       Through the Farming Systems Research under the project, farmers&#13;
will have the opportunity to make their needs known to research and extension&#13;
workers through their participation in training sessions, demonstrations and&#13;
zonal and district committees. At present extension messages are designed&#13;
exclusively by research scientists and extension officers for farmers based on&#13;
their perception. Similarly research programs are based on the ideas of the&#13;
scientists. Under the project, more active participation of farmers in the&#13;
identification of problem areas, in the design of research programs, and the&#13;
application of research results would be further encouraged under a farming&#13;
systems approach to research and extension.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-191-&#13;
23.       However, there are many interpretations of "Farming Systems&#13;
Research" (FSR), ranging from the introduction of a concept of mixed farming&#13;
to experiments on crop rotations. Under the project, farming systems research&#13;
approach that has been used by the International Agricultural Research Centers&#13;
would be tried.&#13;
24.       To promote demand driven research programs, a FSR committee would&#13;
be established comprising members from research, extension, NGOs and farmers,&#13;
and would meet at either Jorhat or Guwahati twice each year. The committee&#13;
would be responsible for commissioning joint diagnostic surveys through the&#13;
regional research stations, for soliciting and funding research proposals&#13;
emanating from the surveys, and funding proposals for on-farm trials received&#13;
from research, extension and NGOs. The chairmanship of the committee would&#13;
oscillate between the Department of Agriculture and ASAU.&#13;
25.       Education and Training.  The Assam Agricultural University is also&#13;
responsible for education and training of pre-service staff.   At present&#13;
there is a surplus number of trained manpower at all levels and many of them&#13;
are un-employed. All positions at the village level extension worker (VLEW)&#13;
level are also filled. Therefore, the project would not support any pre-&#13;
service training, except for women candidates. The objective is to increase&#13;
women representation in the extension service as their present number is&#13;
minimal.&#13;
26.       ASAU would continue to provide in-service training, the function&#13;
which was not accomplished under the NAEP III. The training would support&#13;
research aimed at technology generation, strengthen extension service, and&#13;
develop a farming systems approach to research with a subsidiary aim of&#13;
improving linkages among research scientists, extension staff and the farming&#13;
community. The training facility at Naltali would be upgraded to function as&#13;
a state level staff Training Institute.&#13;
27.       There is clear need to provide in-service training to both staff&#13;
and farmers. However, the need for pre-service training and education would&#13;
critically be evaluated before any additional support is provided. Given the&#13;
over supply of graduates and the complete staffing of the Agricultural&#13;
Department, there are indications that the output of graduates and VLEW should&#13;
be curtailed.&#13;
28.       In service training and farmers training is decided centrally and&#13;
does not appear to be related to identified needs at the field level. This is&#13;
also a lack of an overall policy for training in the development plan of the&#13;
state. There is no clear allocation of responsibility for training at the&#13;
various levels. Within the crop sector both ASAU and the department of&#13;
Agriculture are providing training independently and each is seeking to&#13;
upgrade its farmer training facilities.&#13;
29.       To assist GOA address the above problem, a consultant would be&#13;
recruited under the project to prepare a curriculum for the Naltali training&#13;
center, and coordinate preparation of an overall state agricultural training&#13;
policy and implementation plan. Until the plan is prepared, no additional&#13;
support for training would be provided under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-192-&#13;
30.       Extension.  The management and organization of the extension&#13;
service in Assam was established under the previous Bank supported projects&#13;
which introduced the Train and Visit (T&amp;V) approach. Under the project, the&#13;
approach would be modified to ensure broad based extension service is extended&#13;
to all agricultural sub-divisions. Additionally, reforms would be introduced&#13;
aimed at addressing recognized limitations of the current extension system.&#13;
The limitations include excessive manpower requirements, failure of the&#13;
contact farmer approach, lack of contact with women farmers, limitation of&#13;
extension to crops and a top-down delivery system for improved technology. To&#13;
increase the effectiveness of extension agents, the number of demonstrations&#13;
per VLEW would be limited to three. These demonstrations would focus on crop&#13;
diversification and intensification. It is estimated each demonstration would&#13;
not cost more than Rs.500 a year. The technologies to be popularized and the&#13;
organization of individual demonstrations would be proposed in the annual&#13;
plans to be approved by PCC.&#13;
31.       To expand coverage the project would finance extension service into&#13;
eight additional sub-divisions and provide vehicles for the Agricultural&#13;
department and extension staff on a hire purchase arrangement under existing&#13;
conditions and regulations. Also the project would encourage the use of&#13;
existing Field Management Committees (FMC) as conduits of technology transfer&#13;
to the farming community. The aim would be to provide incentives to VLEW to&#13;
ensure their active participation in FMC meetings. It would also broaden the&#13;
knowledge of VLEW to cover the basics of animal husbandry and fisheries so&#13;
they could be introduce these enterprises into the farming systems. VLEW&#13;
would function as contact persons for the subject matter specialists (SMS) of&#13;
other line departments.&#13;
32.       Also, the project would support demonstration of production&#13;
technology (farm power and harvesting) on farmers fields, and post harvest&#13;
technology (crop drying and storage). In addition to direct discussions at&#13;
the FMC level the project would encourage the use of mass-media (radio, TV,&#13;
newspapers, magazines, posters, pamphlets, etc.) for the distribution of&#13;
information. To facilitate this approach the information section of the&#13;
department of agriculture would be strengthened with appropriate equipment.&#13;
33.       To equip the VLEW with basic training in these fields, training&#13;
would be provided and support facilities increased on FTS for demonstration&#13;
purposes. HoweveY to ensure success of the broad based extension approach&#13;
regular consultation with other line departments would be encouraged. Since&#13;
line departments intend to maintain their own extension system, their staff&#13;
could become subject matter specialists and the VLEW would be the initial&#13;
contact with the FMCs.&#13;
34.       The project would pay special interest in promoting the role of&#13;
women in the activities being supported. Funds would also be set aside to&#13;
develop community based model schemes to involve women effectively. These&#13;
would include building the capacity of rural women in organizing training in&#13;
new farming technology. Women representatives would be allocated special&#13;
places in all critical areas of decision making process in the designing and&#13;
implementation of project activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-193-&#13;
35.       Seed Multiplication.  The Assam Seed Corporation is primarily&#13;
responsible for the production and supply of certified seed. However, the&#13;
responsibility for the production of breeder seed lies with the Agricultural&#13;
University and that for foundation seed is with the Department of Agriculture.&#13;
36.       To promote private sector involvement in the production of&#13;
foundation and certified seed, GOA would lease out at least five farms&#13;
including: Mohokal, Gerua, Shillongani, Balijana and Krishnai to be supported&#13;
under the project and agree to lease the remaining farms, in a phased manner.&#13;
Lead farmers (registered seed growers) and private seed companies would be&#13;
contracted to produce certified seed. At the same time, lead farmers' fields&#13;
would be used as demonstration plots for extension purposes.&#13;
37.       Land Administration.  The Revenue Department would be responsible&#13;
for implementing the above scheme. The land consolidation operation would&#13;
involve land exchange, boundary adjustment and in unavoidable circumstances&#13;
land acquisition and allotment to bring about compact holdings. Once&#13;
consolidated, fragmentation of holdings in future would, to the extent&#13;
possible, be kept in check through persuasive and legal measures embodied in&#13;
the Assam Land Consolidation act of 1960.&#13;
38.       Though the government is legally empowered to enforce the Act,&#13;
implementing staff would be required first to convince farmers on the benefits&#13;
of land consolidation and enlist their interest in the program. Only in&#13;
exceptional cases would land acquisition become necessary. In such cases,&#13;
adequate compensation would be provided. To minimize problems, beneficiaries&#13;
would be encouraged to participate at every stage of the program; including&#13;
planning, desigring and implementation of land consolidation. FMCs would be a&#13;
useful vehicle to solicit the cooperation of prospective participants in the&#13;
program.&#13;
39.       The project would update the record of tenancy rights; convert&#13;
annual pattas (land leases) into long term leases, currently 20 years, improve&#13;
field irrigation and drainage system, and promote better land use for economic&#13;
purpose. The responsibility for implementing the scheme would squarely lie&#13;
with the Director of Land Requisition and Reforms under the Revenue Department&#13;
and would be assisted by the Department of Agriculture, specially its&#13;
engineering wing. Two committees would be created to monitor progress, and&#13;
coordinate implementation. The committee at the district level would be&#13;
headed by the Deputy Commissioner of Kamrup district, while the state level&#13;
committee would be chaired by the Secretary (Revenue) with representatives of&#13;
farmers, NGOs, and selected staff of the Departments of Agriculture and&#13;
Extension.&#13;
40.       Because of the pilot nature of the land consolidation program, it&#13;
does not include cost recovery from farmers. Nevertheless the Land&#13;
consolidation Act of 1960 provides for cost recovery of up-to 50 percent of&#13;
the cost of land consolidation from benefiting farmers. Because the project&#13;
includes computerization of records, land administration would be simplified&#13;
greatly. This would be a necessary tool for land administration, including&#13;
land reforms, revenue collection, resettlement, land regulation through quick&#13;
access to accurate data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-194-&#13;
41.       To supplement GOA's effort to computerize land records, currently&#13;
supported by GOI in three districts, the project would assist in expanding and&#13;
improving the system through additional training of revenue staff and a&#13;
provision of computers and associated software for two additional districts,&#13;
namely Darrang and Karimganj. However, before concrete plans can be made to&#13;
include the component in the project, GOA would have to prepare a detailed&#13;
proposal for Bank review. The proposal should include procedures to&#13;
authenticate computer print outs and issue legally acceptable "pattas" to land&#13;
holders which could be used to secure Bank loans for land development.&#13;
Also, GOA would have to design guidelines for periodically up-dating the&#13;
computerized land records. The objective should be to ensure that, the system&#13;
renders accurate information.&#13;
Infrastructure Component&#13;
42.       Irrigation Activities.  Most of the irrigation schemes would be&#13;
implemented by the Irrigation Department, except shallow tubewells (STWs)&#13;
which would be handled by the Department of Agriculture. User groups would&#13;
also be involved in the construction and operation and maintenance of the&#13;
irrigation schemes. Both PWD and the engineering wing of DOA have the&#13;
capacity to implement these schemes.&#13;
43.       The Irrigation Department would undertake detailed field surveys&#13;
and identify suitable locations using the agreed criteria for selection of&#13;
potential irrigation schemes (Annex 9, Attachment 2). After which a short&#13;
list would be prepared and discussed by potential user groups to establish&#13;
their interest in implementing these schemes.&#13;
44.       In the case of new STWs, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)&#13;
would be consulted to ensure a balanced ground water budget is maintained,&#13;
through proper spacing between wells in the locations selected. The Regional&#13;
Directorate of CGWB in Guwahati is already conducting detailed studies on&#13;
recharge and well spacing requirements, which would be available prior to&#13;
implementation as an integral part of the annual work plan (para 3.9). In the&#13;
case of schemes for rehabilitation, a list would be prepared by the irrigation&#13;
Department before final selection to analyze details such as: age, location,&#13;
type of pumpset, well yield, average electric power supply, average&#13;
utilization, farmers' willingness to run the diesel pumps, and existing crop&#13;
yield.&#13;
45.       Also, before construction of new and rehabilitation of existing&#13;
deep tubewells and river-pumping schemes, farmers' interest and willingness to&#13;
participate would be assessed by project staff. Tangible proof of farmers'&#13;
commitment to the project would include their agreement to contribute up-to&#13;
30% of the cost , either in-cash or in-kind of the proposed investment. After&#13;
rehabilitation of DTWs and river-pumping schemes by the project, GOA would&#13;
transfer ownership to user groups established as associations or formally&#13;
registered FMCs under the Societies Act.&#13;
46.       To ensure proper operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of irrigation&#13;
schemes, particularly those owned and operated by user groups, agreement to&#13;
collect water charges from user group members would be one of the selection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-195-&#13;
criteria for their participation. In the case of diesel-powered units,&#13;
initial contribution equivalent to about 30% of the investment cost would be&#13;
collected from the user groups and paid to the Irrigation Department. In the&#13;
case of farmers using electric power for the DTWs and river-pumping schemes,&#13;
the organization would pay the electricity charges directly to the ASEB.&#13;
47.       The Irrigation Department would design a training program for&#13;
farmers and user groups in the O&amp;M of irrigation schemes. The training&#13;
program would emphasize the importance of proper O&amp;M of irrigation assets.&#13;
Participation of NGOs in irrigation activities would be encouraged to ensure&#13;
local ownership and sustainability of the investment in the long-run. Once&#13;
suitable NGOs have been identified, they would be trained to coordinate&#13;
implementation of irrigation activities between the Irrigation Department and&#13;
farmer groups. They would also help in identifying potential&#13;
farmer groups and guide them through their establishment as legal units under&#13;
the Societies Act.&#13;
48.       Because the success of irrigation activities would depend on the&#13;
level of support and participation of the beneficiaries, establishment of a&#13;
voluntary water users association for a particular scheme, with actual&#13;
contribution towards the cost of construction, would be a pre-requisite for&#13;
inclusion of such a scheme under the project. Full ownership with&#13;
responsibilities for O&amp;M of the irrigation schemes by beneficiaries would be&#13;
explained clearly, preferably by NGOs, during the process of establishing&#13;
water users associations.&#13;
49.       Though ground water development is one of the important investment&#13;
priorities of GOA due to its vast potential, it is important to follow certain&#13;
standard norms/guidelines provided by GOA while installing the wells. Under&#13;
normal circumstances, a spacing of 200 m between wells and in areas such as&#13;
north of the Brahmaputra River is considered adequate. However, a wider&#13;
spacing of 300 m would be suitable for moderate transmissivity resulting in&#13;
higher draw downs. In locations characterized by low transmissivity, only&#13;
STWs with low discharge design for a command area limited to about one hectare&#13;
would be ideal.&#13;
50.       In locations such as north of Brahmaputra River, twin-tube wells&#13;
with a central pumping system would be implemented instead of conventional&#13;
boring due to boulder formations even at shallow depths of 15 to 20 m below&#13;
the surface. In the deeper zones, design of the tubewells would be primarily&#13;
based on hydraulic conductivity.&#13;
51.       Priority for STWs construction and installation of pumps would be&#13;
given to individual farmers or user groups, depending on their willingness and&#13;
capacity to implement the schemes. Otherwise the task would be contracted&#13;
out, with the consent of the concerned beneficiaries. To ensure ease of&#13;
operation and maintenance of STWs, the capacity of diesel pumps would be&#13;
restricted to 20 horse power. The STW installation would be done with a&#13;
combination of GI and PVC pipes. For example, for a STW with a depth of 30&#13;
meters, the combination could be: 3 meter GI pipe, 17 meters PVC pipe and 10&#13;
meters iron cum HDP strainer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-196-&#13;
52.       Rural Roads.  The sub-component would be implemented by both Public&#13;
Works Department (PWD) and DRDA. The Chief Engineer of PWD would be&#13;
responsible for overall supervision of implementation. To expedite&#13;
completion, road construction would be undertaken by local private&#13;
contractors. The sub-component would also include services of consultants to&#13;
assist in the preparation of designs and drawings, supervision of construction&#13;
contracts and training of staff. Contract management consultants would&#13;
include: (a) Team Leader, (b) Quantity Surveyor, (c) Road Engineer, (d) Bridge&#13;
Engineer and (e) Training Engineer; for the duration of the project.&#13;
Consultants for planning and detail engineering services would include: Design&#13;
and Soil Engineers for 36 man-months. Roads to be upgraded have been selected&#13;
in significant-length stretches to facilitate tendering and contract&#13;
supervision. Because more detailed work including designs, drawings and&#13;
preparation of specifications and bidding documents for rural roads would be&#13;
required before implementation starts, a realistic project implementation plan&#13;
would be part of the annual work plan.&#13;
53.       Most roads in the project area, especially Major District Roads&#13;
(MDRs) and Ordinary District Roads (ODRs) would be constructed with a&#13;
formation width (shoulder edge to shoulder edge) of 7.5 m and a carriageway&#13;
width of 3.5 m. This cross-section would of sufficient width to be&#13;
strengthened when traffic develops. Bituminous surfacing is not contemplated,&#13;
although on environmental grounds it may be necessary to minimize dust in&#13;
large settlements. However, for DRDA roads which pass through highly&#13;
inhabited areas, the full 7.5 m formation may not be attainable. Under these&#13;
circumstances the toe of embankments may be supported by small retaining&#13;
walls, thus avoiding the need to take land and/or damage buildings.&#13;
54.       Minor cross-drainage structures would be provided by single or&#13;
multiple lines of 1 m diameter Class NP2 reinforced concrete pipes with head&#13;
walls. The crossings of larger streams would be by means of slab culverts on&#13;
mass abutments of bonded masonry carried down to suitable foundations. For&#13;
river crossings, bridges would be designed in reinforced concrete and would be&#13;
single lane for village roads, but double lane in the case of MDRs.&#13;
55.       Because the condition of rural roads is deplorable especially&#13;
during the monsoon season due to poor repair and maintenance, the consultants&#13;
provided under the project to assist GOA prepare a road maintenance policy and&#13;
financing plan should examine the possibility of mobilizing rural communities&#13;
to provide labor input as "in-kind" tax. Also, centrally sponsored employment&#13;
schemes could be tried for road repair and maintenance on a pilot basis in&#13;
selected districts. For example, funds are allocated annually to DRDA for&#13;
employment generating schemes, but no effort has been made to use these funds&#13;
for road maintenance. Also the possibility of using taxes on fuel under the&#13;
"central road funds", and market cess would be examined.&#13;

Annex 17&#13;
Assam Rural Infrastructure and Agricultural Services Project&#13;
Procedures and Guidelines for Resettlement&#13;
1.        The project investments are not expected to displace any&#13;
communities. However GOA may, in the interest of road realignment,&#13;
construction of large fish ponds and irrigation tanks, consider volurtary&#13;
resettlement of communities resident within the project area.&#13;
2.        The preparation of a relocation plan that attempts to restore&#13;
living standards, earning capacity and production levels of the displaced&#13;
people, would include provision to: -&#13;
(a) assist the displaced people in the relocation move and provide&#13;
support during the transition period in the new site;&#13;
(b) assist the displaced people in their efforts to improve their&#13;
former living standards, income earning capacity, and production&#13;
levels, or at least to.restore them. The project would give&#13;
highest priority for inclusion of these people in the project&#13;
activities in order to improve their incomes and resources.&#13;
3.        The project would involve both settlers and hosts in designing the&#13;
relocation plan of resettlement activities, and place special emphasis on:&#13;
(a) community participation in the planning and implementation of&#13;
resettlement activities;&#13;
(b) establishment of social organizations and use of existing social&#13;
and cultural institutions of settlers and hosts, as far as&#13;
possible;&#13;
(c) measures to integrate re-settlers socially and economically into&#13;
host communities, if applicable.&#13;
4.        When displacement is unavoidable, a detailed resettlement plan&#13;
should be prepared, with a time table and budget as required. Resettlement&#13;
plans should be based on a strategy to improve or at least restore the&#13;
economic base for those relocated. The content of the resettlement plans,&#13;
should normally include a statement of objectives and policies and other&#13;
features.&#13;
5.        Prior to relocation, people should be provided with a compensation&#13;
package of support for housing, village infrastructure, land and irrigation to&#13;
compensate for lost assets. Compensation would be facilitated by:&#13;
(a) paying special attention to the adequacy of legal arrangements&#13;
concerning land title, registration, and site occupation;&#13;
(b) publicizing among affected people to be displaced the laws and&#13;
regulations governing relocation and compensation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-207-&#13;
(c) development of mechanisms to prevent illegal encroachment to take&#13;
advantage of such benefits and to prevent nonresidents moving into&#13;
those areas vacated by the oustees; and&#13;
(d) establishment of a simple grievance mechanism to resolve any&#13;
dispute that may arise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-208-&#13;
Annex I18&#13;
Assam Rural Infrastructure and Agricultural Services Prolect&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
Area Influenced by Prolect&#13;
1.        Most of project activities would be limited to the plains areas of&#13;
Assam. The area comprises 18 administrative Districts on the floor of the&#13;
broad Bhramaputra valley, plus 3 administrative Districts in plains areas of&#13;
the Barak River valley to the south, separated by 2 hill Districts of&#13;
different environmental and ethnic characte~r. Project activities in these&#13;
hill districts would be limited to horticultural production.&#13;
2.        The project would include: (a) extension services for horticulture,&#13;
fisheries, and livestock; (b) Institutional Development (technology generation&#13;
and extension, seed multiplication and land administration, and planning and&#13;
coordination); and (c) Infrastructure (irrigation and rural roads).  With the&#13;
exception of research, extension, seed multiplication and horticultural&#13;
components, which are expected to influence fairly large areas, the proportion&#13;
of land or water areas in the state likely to be affected by the remaining&#13;
project activities is very small. The extension, research and seed&#13;
multiplication activities are expected to result in intensification on land&#13;
which is already in production, and will not require changes in land use.&#13;
Likely Environmental Impact of Project Activities, and Miticatina Measures if&#13;
Reauired&#13;
Rice-based Farming Systems&#13;
3.        The likely environmental impacts of proposed Project activities in&#13;
rice-based agricultural systems are expected to be minimal. No new land will&#13;
be brought under cultivation. Mechanization is not a primary objective of the&#13;
Project, but if the use of farm machinery does increase as a consequence of&#13;
Project activities, the machines will be relatively light-weight power tillers&#13;
which are not likely to result in significant compaction of soil.&#13;
4.        The use of artificial fertilizers is very low in Assam.  Until&#13;
1989/90 the rate of consumption was about 6-7 kg/ha (compared to the national&#13;
average of about 50 kg/ha and consumption in Punjab of about 150kg/ha). In&#13;
1990/91 the Department of Agriculture promoted the use of fertilizer and&#13;
consumption rose to 11.4 kg/ha. Phosphatic and Potassic fertilizer were&#13;
decontrolled in 1992/3, with the result that prices rose and consumption fell&#13;
to an average of 8.5kg/ha.  Artificial fertilizers are used mostly on rabi&#13;
(dry season) crops. Consumption is not expected to increase greatly as a&#13;
result of the Project.&#13;
5.        The use of pesticides and herbicides is also low.  The use averages&#13;
less than one kilogram per hectare. The quantity consumed is not expected to&#13;
change under the project. Herbicides are used mainly for demonstration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-209-&#13;
purposes on direct-seeded autumn paddy. Consumption is not likely to increase&#13;
greatly as a result of the Project. As a result project activities are&#13;
unlikely to promote new agro-industries.&#13;
Horticulture&#13;
6.        Similar arguments are applicable to the horticulture component of&#13;
the project which will be directed toward domestic cultivation of a limited&#13;
number of crops (pineapple, banana, citrus, arecanut, coconut) already present&#13;
in the area. No new land or change of land use will be required. The use of&#13;
pesticides (including fungicides) is currently low, but is likely to increase.&#13;
However, the concepts of Integrated Pest Management have already been&#13;
introduced into the area, and will continue to be promoted, as will education&#13;
in the proper handling, disposal or recycling of pesticide containers, safe&#13;
methods of spraying, and the use of protective clothing by extension workers.&#13;
There is no general prophylactic use of pesticides in horticulture in Assam.&#13;
As with rice the use of artificial fertilizer on horticultural crops is low.&#13;
The use of compost and other natural fertilizers is and will continue to be&#13;
advocated.&#13;
Livestock&#13;
7.        The main environmental impact arising from the livestock component&#13;
will be the possible conversion of small areas of waste land, or other land&#13;
not currently under crops or permanent pasture to fodder production.&#13;
Leguminous fodder crops will not require artificial fertilizer and could have&#13;
beneficial effects on soil and soil conservation. Pressure from grazing will&#13;
be reduced as more animals will be stall-fed. Production of manure from&#13;
cattle may become more concentrated as the animals will be stall fed rather&#13;
than grazed, and, while care will need to be taken that this does not create&#13;
local pollution of surface water, and of human habitation areas, it will&#13;
facilitate recycling of manure to fields and composting sites. The cattle&#13;
population may actually decrease as the larger Jersey cross breeds increase in&#13;
proportion to current unimproved animals, thus lessening pressure on grazing&#13;
lands.&#13;
S.        Increase in pig raising may be concentrated in tribal areas, where&#13;
pigs are a prominent element in farming systems. Since pigs are traditionally&#13;
housed close to human habitation hazards to human health could result. These&#13;
could include increased risk of diarrhoeal diseases, and a suggested link&#13;
between presence of pigs and occurrence of the serious disease Japanese&#13;
encephalitis, which is endemic to Assam. Appropriate mitigating measures&#13;
would include research (perhaps jointly between the Departments of&#13;
Agriculture, Health, and the Tribal Research Institute) to determine the&#13;
extent of the problem, and to find solutions involving the community in their&#13;
own health management.&#13;
9.        Intensification of production of poultry, ducks, or other small&#13;
livestock is not likely to cause environmental problems provided they are not&#13;
housed too close to human habitations, the environment is kept clean, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-210-&#13;
manure they produce is recycled. In tea growing areas care should be taken&#13;
that grass for animals is not cut from areas which may have been sprayed with&#13;
pesticides.&#13;
Fisheries&#13;
10.       The main environmental impacts likely to arise from fisheries are&#13;
loss of existing habitat hence possible loss in biodiversity; and change in&#13;
water quality through overloading with organic matter.&#13;
11.       The Project proposes rehabilitation of existing fishing places&#13;
rather than the creation of new ones. This will result in a change from&#13;
wetland habitats to open water with balanced vegetation and fish life below&#13;
the surface, some loss of existing habitats will occur. The proportion in the&#13;
State overall will be small (2 per cent). It is proposed to rehabilitate so&#13;
of the existing 906 beels (5 per cent), and 3 per cent of existing derelict&#13;
tanks or ponds and swamps. Local changes are likely to occur in both resident&#13;
and migratory wild life, e.g. the numbers of snakes, frogs and insects were&#13;
reported as having declined in numbers at one rehabilitated fish pond. A&#13;
counterbalancing positive benefit could be reduction in malaria and other&#13;
insect- or water-borne diseases. A possible mitigating action would be to&#13;
leave some existing vegetation untouched in the water body as wildlife refuges&#13;
and genetic reservoirs. Care should also be taken to ensure that breeding&#13;
areas for wild fish are not lost. Preliminary studies by professionals&#13;
jointly with local community members should be made of each proposed&#13;
rehabilitation site, and the environmental issues discussed with the community&#13;
before any action is taken.&#13;
12.       The second environmental concern is change in water quality in&#13;
enclosed water bodies due to overloading with organic manure. The BOD will&#13;
increase, which will affect the growth of fish and allow undesirable weeds,&#13;
particularly water hyacinth, to grow, leading to eutrophication. So that&#13;
farmers may monitor and control the water quality of their ponds the Project&#13;
is proposing to provide analysis kits for water and soil to farmers, backed up&#13;
by Government water and soil testing facilities through the area, and training&#13;
in their use. Water hyacinth is a serious weed problem in water bodies&#13;
throughout the State. Only mechanical means are currently used to remove it,&#13;
and weed arresters are used to prevent its entry into fishing areas. No&#13;
economically viable use has yet been found for water hyacinth, although&#13;
studies to find utility for the bio-mass are being undertaken at the Regional&#13;
Research center at Jorhat. On a broader scale water quality throughout the&#13;
State needs to be protected against pollution from sewerage and industrial&#13;
effluent. The Pollution Control Board monitors water quality and is empowered&#13;
to discipline offenders. If called upon the PCB will assist the Department of&#13;
Fisheries in this regard.&#13;
Minor Irrication&#13;
13.       Environmental impacts from the irrigation component of the Project&#13;
are not expected to be significant. The Project proposes to irrigate from new&#13;
shallow tube wells or minor irrigation projects about 50,000 ha of formerly&#13;
non-irrigated land and stabilize some deep tube wells commanding some 4500 ha.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-211-&#13;
The withdrawal of more irrigation water is unlikely to deplete groundwater,&#13;
since recharge greatly exceeds the rate of withdrawal. It may have positive&#13;
benefits in countering the rising water table, thus lessening the problem of&#13;
water-logging. Equally drainage of newly irrigated areas is not expected to&#13;
be a problem, since farmers, (who will be managing their own projects) are&#13;
unlikely to use excess water because they will be paying a charge for it.&#13;
Since soils often are high in iron the groundwater also has a high iron&#13;
content, and this could lead to land degradation and lower yields. Irrigation&#13;
may have some effect on the quality of surface run-off water. The surface&#13;
water schemes proposed under the Project are unlikely to submerge any habitats&#13;
or cultivated lands.&#13;
Rural Roads&#13;
14.       Since the roads program is comprised only of rehabilitation of&#13;
existing roads no significant loss of agricultural land will be required.&#13;
Bridge replacement and road surfacing will require aggregate from quarries or&#13;
boulders. To avoid additional dust, noise, and visual pollution existing&#13;
rather than new quarries should be used where possible, and quarry sites&#13;
should be screened by trees or in other ways. If boulders must be extracted&#13;
from river beds to prevent erosion of the bed they should be removed from&#13;
shallow depths only. Regular removal of vegetation from around the piers of&#13;
bridges should be undertaken before the wet season so that the free flow of&#13;
water is not impeded. Flooding in the larger rivers is causing their beds to&#13;
fill with silt and become raised, and the flood area to extend. Environmental&#13;
awareness and education programs in the State generally should encourage&#13;
reforestation of watersheds to counter this problem. A positive impact of the&#13;
roads program will be improved mobility and access to market for farmers.&#13;
Conversely, however, it will allow outsiders to enter districts which formerly&#13;
have been less accessible, with possible social impacts.&#13;
Appointment of Environmental Scientist to Proiect Implementation Unit&#13;
15.       It is proposed that an environmental scientist should be attached&#13;
to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to undertake the following tasks:&#13;
(a) screen all proposals for Project activities put forward from all&#13;
components of the Project for potential environmental (including&#13;
social) impact according to criteria given in paragraph 17 of the&#13;
environmental analysis;&#13;
(b) make at least one field visit to the site of every proposed&#13;
discrete activity and assess the likely environmental impact in&#13;
consultation with the local community for every proposed activity&#13;
specify appropriate mitigatory measures if required, and agree with&#13;
the proposing agency on ways they can be implemented;&#13;
(c) set up appropriate monitoring systems to measure indicators of&#13;
environmental change as required (e.g. water quality in fishponds;&#13;
use of pesticides; equal participation of tribal people, etc.);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-212-&#13;
(d) hold regular workshops/training sessions with Project staff,&#13;
relevant staff of the division of the Department of Agriculture&#13;
proposing the Project, and any NGO staff involved to discuss&#13;
specific environmental issues arising from Project activities, and&#13;
the results of monitoring activities; and&#13;
(e) provide reports at three-monthly intervals to the Project&#13;
Coordination Committee and the Project Guidance Committee on the&#13;
environmental health of the Project.&#13;
16.       It is unlikely that a single individual will possess qualifications&#13;
and experience in all the fields that may be required.  A number of agencies&#13;
in Assam have expressed willingness to assist in the environmental monitoring&#13;
of the Project's activities. These include the Assam Science, Technology and&#13;
Environment Council (which has particularly relevant competence in its Remote&#13;
Sensing Division), the Assam Institute of Research for Tribals and Scheduled&#13;
Castes, and the Pollution Control Board.&#13;
Prolect Activity Screenincr&#13;
17.       Each proposed Project activity, (e.g. rehabilitation of a beel or&#13;
existing fishpond or tank; decision for extension workers to advocate use of a&#13;
particular pesticide in horticulture, advocation of new fodder production for&#13;
livestock under a particular Field Management Group, selection of a particular&#13;
site for the installation of a shallow tube well, replacement of bridge on a&#13;
rural road, etc.) should be screened by the Environmental Scientist. The&#13;
essential questions to be answered include whether the project activity would:&#13;
(a) result in a change of current land use;&#13;
(b) result in a loss of wildlife habitat in the local area;&#13;
(c) result in a change in water quality;&#13;
(d) increase the use of pesticides (including fungicides, herbicides,&#13;
weedicides) in the local area;&#13;
(e) generate air or noise pollution;&#13;
(f) result in changes in the flow of rivers;&#13;
(g) result in social changes ( e.g. easier migration into a community);&#13;
and&#13;
(h) result in changes which could affect the health of the community.&#13;
18.       If the answer to any of these q(uestions is affirmative, the&#13;
Environmental Scientist should specify appropriate mitigating measures. The&#13;
Environmental Scientist will also be responsible for designing appropriate&#13;
monitoring measures, and for arranging for either the appropriate officers of&#13;
the Department of Agriculture or for outside Government or NGO agencies to&#13;
execute the measures. As much as possible monitoring systems should include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-213-&#13;
the local community, who should be encouraged to find innovative ways of&#13;
participation. A simple Environmental Status form should be designed and&#13;
completed for each Project activity. (An example is given in Annex B.)&#13;
Environmental Classification of Prolosed Prolect&#13;
The Project is assessed as Categorv B, for the following reasons:&#13;
(a) overall the project will affect a very small proportion of the&#13;
cultivable land and water areas of the State&#13;
(b)  the development of rice-based farming systems and horticulture will&#13;
not require any additional land or result in significant change in&#13;
land use; nor are they likely to reduce biological diversity; the&#13;
use of artificial fertilizer is already much lower than the&#13;
national level and is not expected to rise significantly overall,&#13;
while the use of natural fertilizers will continue to be&#13;
encouraged; the use of pesticides is already lower than national&#13;
levels, and while some use of pesticides may be required by the&#13;
horticultural component, Integrated Pest Management is already&#13;
known in the area and will continue to be promoted by the Project.&#13;
(c) the development of livestock may require conversion of small areas&#13;
(less than 1 per cent of Plains land area) from wasteland or other&#13;
uses to fodder production, but the use of leguminous fodder crops&#13;
may improve soil quality and assist soil conservation; pressure on&#13;
grazing lands may be reduced; housing of pigs near humans should be&#13;
monitored for disadvantageous health effects&#13;
(d) the development of fisheries will result in loss of existing&#13;
wildlife habitat in no more than 2 per cent of total water area in&#13;
the State; changes in water quality will be monitored&#13;
(e) minor irrigation will affect only 1 percent of the total Plains&#13;
land area, will not deplete groundwater resources, and may help&#13;
counter waterlogging of soils&#13;
(f) development of rural roads will not require land acquisition or&#13;
disturb drainage patterns; dust and noise pollution from quarries&#13;
will be monitored and minimized; as will boulder extraction from&#13;
riverbeds if necessary; improved mobility and access will be&#13;
positive benefits for local residents but will allow easier access&#13;
of outsiders&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The primary objectives of the Assam
            Rural Infrastructure and Agricultural Serivices Project will
            be to: 1) improve equity and alleviate poverty by offering
            better opportunities for poorer farmers and women to
            contribute to agricultural growth and income generation; 2)
            improve the nutrition of the rural poor; 3) accelerate
            agricultural growth through improved use of resources,
            relieving infrastructural and technical constraints, and
            providing an enabling environment to facilitate the growth
            of private sector investments; 4) encourage sustainability
            of resource use and quality of the environment; and 5)
            improve the Government's long-term capacity for
            strategic agricultural planning. The project will support:
            1) the Department of Agriculture's work program,
            including the extension services for horticulture,
            fisheries, and livestock to poor rural communities aimed at
            increasing their production; 2) institutional development
            (technology generation and extension, seed multiplication
            and land administration, and planning and coordination); and
            3) rural infrastructure (small scale irrigation and rural
            roads). The project will also include a number of studies
            considered necessary for improving the use of natural
            resources and the marketing of highly perishable
            horticultural products.
