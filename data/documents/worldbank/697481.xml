1. BACKGROUND&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.1         The Government of China has requested Bank Group assistance in financing&#13;
a water resources development project in catchment areas of the mid-Yangtze valley in the&#13;
Provinces of Hubei and Hunan. Although the proposed project would include a broad&#13;
range of water resource activities, the focus of the project would be on water resources for&#13;
agriculture. The project would help improve large areas of irrigation and drainage in both&#13;
provinces, develop new irrigated areas, construct a large concrete dam, and support key&#13;
institutional development and reform in the water resource sector. It would also improve&#13;
watershed protection through interventions in forestry, livestock and fodder improvement&#13;
and provide supporting services for agriculture including improvements to fertilizer&#13;
blending and soil testing capability. The provincial and local governments and the&#13;
Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) prepared the project with assistance of missions from&#13;
the Bank Group and the Food and Agriculture Organization/Cooperative Program in May&#13;
and October 1993. Bank preappraisal and appraisal teams visited the proposed project&#13;
areas in March/April and August/September 1994. A Population and Human Resources&#13;
Development grant from the Government of Japan has helped support preparation of the&#13;
project.&#13;
The Agricultural Sector&#13;
1.2          Agriculture in China provides sustenance for 1.2 billion people and a&#13;
livelihood for some 200 million farm families. Foodgrains occupy about 75 percent of the&#13;
cultivated area, and intensive cultural practices in grain farming allow China to feed about&#13;
22 percent of the world's total population from 7 percent of the world's arable land. With&#13;
growth in the economy, however, the urban/rural income gap is widening. Rural net&#13;
income per capita in 1992 was Y 784, compared to a disposable after tax income of&#13;
Y 1,826 for urban households. Increases in efficiency of production per unit area&#13;
represent one means of narrowing this gap, while increasing the output of staple grains&#13;
remains a priority of the Government of China. Since about half of China's cultivated&#13;
agricultural land is irrigated, improvements to irrigation systems are an important means&#13;
of increasing both reliability and productivity of agriculture and rural income. Further&#13;
intensification will allow Chinese farmers to enjoy an increasing standard of living and to&#13;
diversify production to meet the needs of an increasingly market oriented economy with&#13;
more sophisticated food requirements.&#13;
1.3          Past progress in increasing grain production has been mixed, with&#13;
significant increases after the introduction of rural reforms in 1978-84 followed by&#13;
stagnating grain production in 1984-88. Production reached a new peak in 1990-92&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
following further investment in agriculture (principally in irrigation rehabilitation and&#13;
expansion) and the introduction of reforms in grain procurement, prices, distribution and&#13;
subsidies. Central planning of grain marketing has largely been eliminated, and wheat and&#13;
com prices are approaching world levels as grain commodity exchanges develop in several&#13;
centers, including Wuhan and Changsha. The value of grain production has declined from&#13;
about one-half to one-third of the gross value of agricultural output as production of fruits,&#13;
vegetables, and animal products has increased to meet changing consumer demand. Local&#13;
governments have recognized these changes and now place a high priority on development&#13;
of underutilized lands for the production of high value, nonstaple food and commercial&#13;
crops.&#13;
1.4          Water resources development is critical to continued improvement in&#13;
China's agricultural performance. The productivity of irrigated land averages about twice&#13;
that of rainfed land, and is especially important for high-value crops like fruits and&#13;
vegetables which need assured supplies of water. Irrigation currently accounts for about&#13;
70 percent of total grain output and about 80 percent of fruits and vegetables. In China,&#13;
irrigation permits cropping intensities ranging from 120 percent in the northernmost areas&#13;
of the country to 250 to 300 percent in the southern provinces, and yields under irrigation&#13;
are among the highest in Asia. In some areas, flood control and drainage are also essential&#13;
requirements for raising agricultural productivity.&#13;
1.5          The proposed project areas in Hubei and Hunan are well placed to benefit&#13;
from policy reform and favorable attitudes toward investment by regional governments, if&#13;
physical constraints to production can be overcome. Irrigated area productivity in these&#13;
areas is limited by recurring drought in late summer, frequent flooding in some areas,&#13;
relatively dry winters, and also by imbalanced fertilizer applications, particularly&#13;
inadequate supplies of Oargely imported) potassium fertilizers. Irrigation rehabilitation and&#13;
development, watershed protection, and improvements to fertilizer supply, however, can&#13;
ease these constraints.&#13;
The Water Resources Sector&#13;
1.6          Background. In aggregate terms, China has immense water resources,&#13;
with total annual precipitation of some 6,200 billion m3 and total surface runoff of 2,700&#13;
billion m3. There are many rivers, streams and lakes, and more than 1,500 river basins&#13;
that exceed 1,000 km2. The Yangtze River is the largest river in China and the third&#13;
longest in the world; Dongting Lake, located in the project area, is the second largest lake&#13;
in China. On a per capita basis, however, annual runoff averages about 2,300 m3, which&#13;
is a quarter of the world average. Precipitation is variable and concentrated in the summer&#13;
wet season, and many areas are subject to frequent droughts and floods. The geographical&#13;
distribution of water resources is uneven. There are severe periodic water shortages&#13;
particularly in the north and west of the country, and there is a growing macro water&#13;
shortage in the Yellow River Basin, which is the primary source of water in the northern&#13;
region. Available water resources are concentrated in the South where utilization is less&#13;
than 20 percent of potential supply. Although the western areas are arid, population and&#13;
demand there are also low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.7          Since 1949, vast investments in water resource works and development&#13;
have been undertaken. Irrigated area has expanded from about 20 million ha to nearly 50&#13;
million ha. Some 84,000 reservoirs for irnigation, flood control, power and water supply&#13;
have been constructed with a combined gross storage capacity of 470 Bcm. Approximately&#13;
165,000 km of dikes, levees and coastal embankments have been constructed for flood&#13;
protection and river control. There are now more than 5,500 irrigation systems having&#13;
service areas exceeding 667 ha. Diesel or electric wells now total about 2.7 million.&#13;
Total hydro generating capacity currently exceeds 40,000 MW. Water development and&#13;
control projects have been implemented since ancient times throughout the country, and&#13;
most rivers and streams are now used for irrigation, power generation, transport or urban&#13;
water supply, some for all these purposes.&#13;
1.8          Flood Control. Many rivers are subject to seasonal flooding, and flood&#13;
control works have been progressively constructed in threatened areas. These works&#13;
include regulating reservoirs in the upper catchments, river dikes, flood retention basins,&#13;
and flood protection embankments in the middle and lower reaches. Around 32 million&#13;
ha of farmlands, as well as many urban areas, are now protected to some extent.&#13;
However, only a few cities like Beijing, Harbin and Guangzhou are protected against&#13;
100-year floods, whereas in most other areas protection levels are against 40- to 50-year&#13;
floods or less. Several major rivers, notably the lower Yellow and the middle Yangtze,&#13;
are suspended up to 10 meters above the surrounding countryside, creating the potential&#13;
for catastrophic floods over large areas. Some 450 million people live under risk of&#13;
flooding in these basins.&#13;
1.9          Irrigation and Drainage. The gross irrigable area in the country is about&#13;
49 million ha of which, on average, 41.5 million ha are actually irrigated. The&#13;
productivity of these lands is far higher than in rainfed areas. However, many irrigation&#13;
systems were built to relatively low design standards due to lack of resources, and their&#13;
technical performance is gradually degrading. Most irrigation schemes in China are&#13;
"melons on a vine" systems. What distinguishes them from similar schemes in other&#13;
countries is the extensive use of in-system storage. In addition to the headworks/reservoirs&#13;
serving the systems, these systems have large numbers of small and medium reservoirs and&#13;
ponds (the "melons"), which are the linked to the main canal system (the "vine"). The&#13;
aggregate amount of such storage capacity for such systems is generally fairly large, and&#13;
it enables relatively good overall agricultural performance despite inadequate maintenance.&#13;
Drainage works are essential to allow cultivation in low lying areas subject to waterlogging&#13;
and salinity. So far, drainage works have helped control waterlogging in 19 million ha and&#13;
have reclaimed 4.8 million ha of saline lands.&#13;
1.10         Hydropower.  Hydropower generating capacity totaled 37 GW  and&#13;
produced 125,000 GWh of power in 1991. Only about 9 percent of the estimated&#13;
hydropower potential has been developed. However, most of the potential is located in the&#13;
Southwest (70 percent), some 1,500 km away from the main demand centers. With power&#13;
demand growing rapidly and estimated shortages of 20 percent in the late 1980s, the long&#13;
gestation period for hydropower projects has also inhibited rapid development and&#13;
utilization of hydroelectric resources. The largest source of electricity is thermal power&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
which is produced from coal mined in the north. Many of China's coal-fueled power&#13;
stations are old and produce large amounts of pollutants, in contrast to hydropower which&#13;
produces none. China's southeastern and eastern zones, which are the richest and fastest&#13;
growing areas, are constrained in electricity supply.&#13;
1.11         Municipal and Industrial Water. Most of China's urban population of&#13;
over 450 million have access to piped drinking water. Present water use for domestic&#13;
purposes is relatively low, and in many cities water use is constrained by availability. In&#13;
1992, around 300 counties and 479 cities experienced water shortages. The situation needs&#13;
urgent attention as urban water demand has been rising at over 10 percent annually,&#13;
whereas supplies have been growing at 7 percent annually. China's industrial sector uses&#13;
26 billion m3 annually, which is high relative to output. Large amounts of polluting&#13;
effluents are discharged by industry and there is little water recycling.&#13;
1.12         Transport. Many of the largest cities in China are located on rivers&#13;
(Guangzhou, Chongqing, Nanjing, and Wuhan) or at the mouth of a river (Shanghai).&#13;
River transport has been a major factor in the development of these cities and other areas&#13;
adjacent to rivers. Even today, despite the development of road, rail and air links, water&#13;
transport continues to play an important role.&#13;
1.13         Water Resource Institutions. Water resources, in the form of surface and&#13;
ground water, are public property belonging to the State. Their utilization and exploitation&#13;
are in principle controlled by various State Laws and Regulations, which are overseen by&#13;
the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) and administered by institutions at lower levels.&#13;
Progressive decentralization and lack of resources, however, has weakened the ability of&#13;
the center to control or influence development and management of water resources and to&#13;
implement central water policies and statutes, and increasingly water resource decision-&#13;
making is being transferred to the provincial level. A major problem facing water resource&#13;
institutions at all levels is lack of revenue. To augment their income, many agencies&#13;
engage in subsidiary activities, ranging from mechanical and electrical repairs to fish&#13;
culture in reservoirs, to hotels and restaurants.&#13;
1.14         MWR, previously the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, is&#13;
the highest institution for management of water resources in China. Its duties include&#13;
implementing the State Water Law (para. 1.18) and formulating regulations; long term&#13;
planning of the country's water resources and its main rivers; water and soil conservation;&#13;
organizing the construction of key national water resource projects; organizing flood&#13;
prevention, control and response on major, multijurisdictional rivers; organization and&#13;
leadership for dealing with droughts; promoting training; promoting rural water power;&#13;
developing new technology; providing technical backup to other concerned agencies; and&#13;
liaison with foreign agencies. MWR employs about 1.5 million workers nationwide, some&#13;
93 percent of whom work under provincial governments with the remainder directly under&#13;
MWR. MWR also directly supervises the Water Resources and Hydroelectric Power&#13;
Construction Corporation, administers seven regional river basin commissions and 13&#13;
institutions of higher education, and operates a number of research centers and specialized&#13;
units such as the Remote Sensing Center, the Dam Safety Monitoring Center, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
National Headquarters for Flood Control and Drought Relief. A number of other&#13;
institutions have links to MWR, including various universities, research centers and design&#13;
institutes.&#13;
1.15        Under MWR are seven basin commissions responsible for major river&#13;
basins including the Yangtze Basin and the Tai Lake Basin, each based in its respective&#13;
basin. The duties of these commissions include monitoring and planning of water resource&#13;
development, flood forecasting and warning, designing and executing large scale water&#13;
resource and hydropower projects, guiding and coordinating work on soil and water&#13;
conservation, and monitoring water quality and pollution in their respective basins. Except&#13;
for project planning and approval, however, these commissions have inadequate authority&#13;
over provincial jurisdictions to coordinate or control water resource development and&#13;
management in their respective river basins, although they have greater powers during&#13;
flood operations.&#13;
1.16        Most decisions concerning water development and allocations are made at&#13;
the Provincial level, the main institution being the Provincial Water Resources Bureau&#13;
(WRB). Provincial WRBs handle operation of flood protection works; design and&#13;
implementation of projects; operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of large provincial&#13;
irrigation and drainage infrastructure; and technical back up for lower level WRBs. In&#13;
conjunction with MWR, the relevant River Basin Commission and other specialized&#13;
agencies, Provincial WRBs are also responsible for planning of water resource&#13;
development and soil conservation. Provincial WRBs have a number of affiliated&#13;
institutions, such as the Provincial Hydraulic Design Institutes, Provincial Research&#13;
Institutes, and general hydrology stations, and in many cases construction units which work&#13;
on local and overseas contracts.&#13;
1.17         Prefecture and county WRBs deal with water resources at the local level.&#13;
Their duties include construction and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of local irrigation&#13;
canals and systems within their jurisdiction; local level planning and development of water&#13;
resources; implementation of various regulations and laws; monitoring of water quality and&#13;
pollution levels; and flood control work. For larger projects or 'districts,' special Project&#13;
Management Authorities are created to run key irrigation or drainage facilities such as&#13;
large reservoirs or major conveyance systems. Prefecture and county WRB staff are&#13;
responsible for O&amp;M of medium irrigation and drainage facilities (e.g., submain canals,&#13;
major branch canals, or large pumping stations), planning and distributing water, and&#13;
levying water charges. Township level Water Management Stations (WMSs) are the&#13;
lowest level government bodies involved in water management. They are mainly&#13;
concerned with O&amp;M of small irrigation, drainage and flood control works whose service&#13;
areas are limited to the jurisdiction of a single township. At the village level, water users&#13;
elect water management committees. These committees handle on-farm water management&#13;
under the direction of higher level irrigation district staff; village unit size corresponds to&#13;
about 400 to 500 farm families cultivating 200 to 250 ha, usually served by one or two&#13;
lateral or sublateral canals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.18         Legal Framework. The 'Water Law of the Peoples Republic of China"&#13;
of 1988 (the Water Law) and the Water and Soil Conservation Law of 1989 are the basic&#13;
laws controlling water resource management. FoUlowing the Water Law, a number of&#13;
regulations have been promulgated covering, for example dam safety, land compensation&#13;
and resettlement. The 'Environment Protection Law" is a general law covering among&#13;
other things water pollution; the 'Water Pollution and Prevention Law" is a more specific&#13;
law for controlling water pollution. The general provisions of the Water Law cover such&#13;
aspects as comprehensive planning of water development, the ecology and planned&#13;
alocation of water, and the State's rights to exercise unified administration of water&#13;
resources with delegation of specific responsibilities.&#13;
Water Resource Objectives and Plans&#13;
1.19         Overall Objectives and Strategy. The Govemment's primary objectives&#13;
for the water resources sector are to encourage efficient water use and comprehensive&#13;
water resource and river basin management; promote financial self-sufficiency and cost&#13;
recovery; reduce water pollution; improve flood warning and protection; and undertake&#13;
priority water development projects. The main steps to be taken for the achievement of&#13;
these goals are policy and institutional reforms to improve water resource management;&#13;
increased investment from domestic and foreign sources to improve key water resource&#13;
infrastructure; and better regulation and monitoring of water pollution.&#13;
1.20         Improvement of Existing Irrigation Systems. Much of the existing water&#13;
resource infrastructure was built to relatively low design and construction standards due&#13;
to resource and materials limitations during the 1950s and 1960s. This impacts agriculture&#13;
due to dams which are unsafe or cannot be operated at capacity, and irrigation systems&#13;
which are inefficient and deteriorating rapidly and have excessive maintenance costs. In&#13;
many cases, reservoirs and/or main canals have been constructed for irrigation, but the&#13;
associated distribution systems were never completed. Completion, repair, rehabilitation&#13;
and upgrading of existing facilities present a major opportunity for relatively high return,&#13;
low cost investments, and have been a high priority of the Govemment and the Bank&#13;
Group.&#13;
1.21         Planned Major Projects. There are two massive projects planned for the&#13;
water resources sector which concern the Yangtze River Basin, although neither is related&#13;
to the proposed project. The Three Gorges Project envisages the construction of a dam&#13;
across the Yangtze River downstream of the "Three Gorges' near Yichang City in Hubei&#13;
Province. The concrete gravity dam would have a height of 185 m, length of 2,500 to&#13;
2,800 m, flood control capacity of 22 billion m3, and installed electricity generating&#13;
capacity of 18 GW. The primary purpose of the dam would be flood control, but in&#13;
addition it would generate 84,000 GWh of power annually and improve navigation&#13;
conditions along the middle and lower Yangtze River. The other major project is the&#13;
South North Water Transfer (SNW`I) scheme, now in the planning stage. This would be&#13;
a series of three large interbasin transfers from the water-surplus Yangtze River Basin to&#13;
the water-short Yellow River Basin in the north. One SNWT route, the "Middle Route,"&#13;
would originate in northern Hubei from the Danjiangkou Reservoir, one of the largest in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
China. Completion of stage II of Danjiangkou will increase total storage capacity from&#13;
10.2 to 19 Bcm, compared to mean annual inflow of about 39.8 Bcm from the Han River,&#13;
and theoretically make some 15 Bcm available for transfer to the Yellow River Basin. It&#13;
would also provide about 4 Bcm of regulated storage for hydropower and irrigation in&#13;
Hubei.&#13;
Current Lssues and Constraints in the Water Sector&#13;
1.22         Despite past achievements, China is facing problems and constraints in the&#13;
water and irrigation sector. These problems are becoming increasingly severe as the&#13;
population grows and the economy expands and becomes more market-driven. Two&#13;
critical, macro water resource sector issues were noted above: (a) the growing large-scale&#13;
water shortage in the North, particularly the Yellow River Basin (para. 1.6); and (b) weak&#13;
river basin authorities without adequate statutory or regulatory basis for effective&#13;
comprehensive river basin development and management (para. 1.15). The following key&#13;
physical and institutional/financial constraints impact specifically on water resources for&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
1.23         Physically: (a) many large irrigation schemes constructed in the 1950s and&#13;
1960s were hastily designed and built with low quality materials and equipment. Now,&#13;
most require major rehabilitation and upgrading; (b) many such schemes still lack irrigation&#13;
distribution and drainage networks at the tertiary and farm level. Such networks were to&#13;
have been constructed by local governments, which lacked the incentive to do so due to&#13;
historical deficiencies in grain pricing; (c) large tracts of cultivated land have been affected&#13;
by waterlogging and secondary soil salinization. This is largely due to excessive irrigation&#13;
without effective drainage to control the water table rise; (d) uncontrolled construction of&#13;
tubewells, prompted by government subsidies, has led to overexploitation of groundwater,&#13;
falling water tables, and land subsidence, especially in the North China Plain;&#13;
(e) investment and maintenance for on-farm facilities, formerly a communal responsibility&#13;
during the slack winter season, has been disrupted by the household responsibility system,&#13;
under which households tend to look after their own contracted interests; and (f) operation&#13;
and maintenance (O&amp;W has often been inadequate. Maintenance resources allocated by&#13;
the central and provincial governments have frequently not been matched adequately by&#13;
funding from counties and townships.&#13;
1.24         Institutionally: (a) management of most medium and large irrigation&#13;
schemes is fragmented, which makes efficient overall system operation difficult. Low&#13;
level WRBs are responsible for O&amp;M of canals only within their administrative&#13;
jurisdiction, and the Project Management Authority at the system level has only limited&#13;
authority over operation, performance and standards of lower level WRBs, which are&#13;
controlled by the local government administration; (b) direct participation by the farmers&#13;
in system operation and decision making, except at the lowest levels, is very limited. This&#13;
reduces their sense of ownership and responsibility, and consequently their willingness to&#13;
pay water charge rates sufficient for long-run sustainability; (c) water charges are&#13;
frequently too low to cover full costs. In effect, they often become a ceiling, holding&#13;
down water revenues needed to improve maintenance even where farmers are willing to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
pay higher water charges for better service; (d) water demand for municipalities and&#13;
industry is growing rapidly and in some areas, notably the lower Yellow River basin,&#13;
reallocation of water is already reducing irrigated area. No systematic institutional or legal&#13;
framework is in place to handle these competing water demands and reallocation&#13;
requirements; (e) flood control and warning is increasingly important to promote and&#13;
protect rapid economic growth, especially in the major river basins like the Yangtze and&#13;
Yellow. But there is no established method of collecting fees for such services to make&#13;
them self-sustaining; (f) water pollution from urban areas and dispersed rural industries is&#13;
growing rapidly and has proven difficult to control despite strong environmental legislation;&#13;
(g) cuts in central Government budgets for water resource development beginning in 1980&#13;
have curtailed measures to alleviate some of these constraints, and development of new&#13;
water resources has not kept pace with demand from agriculture, industry and urban&#13;
centers. Although state capital investment has rebounded somewhat since 1985, it still falls&#13;
short of pre-1980 levels in real terms; and (h) decentralization and reduced central&#13;
investment resources have diminished the ability of MWR to guide and influence&#13;
comprehensive water resource development and policy systematically.&#13;
Past Bank Support and Key Lessons Learned&#13;
1.25         Past Bank Support for Water Resources in Agriculture. Starting with&#13;
the North China Plain Agricultural Project (Cr. 1261-CHA) in 1982, the Bank has so far&#13;
financed 15 agricultural projects in China having major water resources components with&#13;
associated lending of some $3.9 billion and covering a total irrigated area of about 3.8&#13;
million ha. Although some of these projects included construction of new irrigation, in&#13;
most cases they aimed at improving existing irrigation and drainage systems. All projects&#13;
have financed physical works as well as a wide range of supporting rural infrastructure and&#13;
services. These projects were mostly implemented by WRBs at provincial, county and&#13;
township levels, and implementation performance of these local level institutions has&#13;
generally been positive. Three projects with major water resource components have&#13;
closed-the North China Plain, Heilongjiang Land Reclamation Project (Ln. 2261-CHA/&#13;
Cr. 1347-CHA), and Pishihang-Chaohu Area Development Project (Ln. 2579-CHA/Cr.&#13;
1606-CHA); all were reported to be highly successful.&#13;
1.26         Lessons Learned. Key lessons from previous water resource projects are&#13;
that: (a) detailed organizational and staffing arrangements should be formulated and agreed&#13;
before implementation; (b) countexpart funding should be agreed before implementation;&#13;
(c) project design should support the 'user pays' principle, and user (farmer) participation&#13;
should be explicitly built into project planning, implementation and operation; (d) flood&#13;
protection investments should include cost recovery from beneficiaries; (e) irrigation and&#13;
water conservancy projects should include provisions for unified irrigation system&#13;
management based on hydraulic units; and (f) projects should include institutional&#13;
development support for strengthening of provincial and local WRBs. These lessons have&#13;
been incorporated into the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.27         The proposed project is consistent with the Bank Group's Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy for China distributed to the Board in August 1993. That strategy&#13;
emphasized income enhancement and poverty alleviation as the highest priorities in the&#13;
agriculture sector. It also highlighted the need to improve water resource planning,&#13;
especially in flood prone areas, and coordination between provinces in water resource&#13;
development. Although not designed specifically for poverty alleviation, the proposed&#13;
project would benefit mainly rural dwellers many of whom have poverty-level incomes,&#13;
and one of the major subprojects is located in a remote region which is classified as a&#13;
poverty area. The project would also provide substantial direct environmental benefits&#13;
through flood control by the Jiangya Dam commanding the Lishui Basin in Hunan, and&#13;
from soil conservation under the forestry and grassland components. Bank involvement&#13;
will also help to promote better policy and institutional development and change in the&#13;
water resources sector.  The project would support establishment of self-financing&#13;
irrigation districts based on farmer participation and of comprehensive river basin&#13;
management for the Lishui River Basin in Hunan, both of which are primary elements of&#13;
Bank and Chinese water resources policy. The project would also further technological&#13;
innovation in water resources: Jiangya Dam would employ a relatively new, more cost-&#13;
effective construction technique and would be the one of the highest dams of its type in the&#13;
world when completed, and several of the irrigation subprojects would incorporate canal&#13;
automation on a pilot basis for improved operational efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
2.1          The project area would be the mid-Yangtze River Basin in the provinces&#13;
of Hubei and Hunan. In Hubei, five water resource subprojects-Dongfeng, Zhenghe,&#13;
Yindan, Wenxia and Sihu-and four nonwater resource subprojects would be located in 24&#13;
counties/municipalities which cover about 2.0 million ha of cultivated land. In Hunan,&#13;
three water resource subprojects-Jiangya Dam, Tieshan and Liuduzhai-would be located&#13;
in nine counties and one municipality covering some 0.8 million ha of cultivated land.&#13;
Yangtze River Basin&#13;
2.2          Background. The Yangtze River is the largest river in China, and one of&#13;
the largest and the third longest in the world. The Yangtze Basin population exceeds 350&#13;
million, of whom 86 percent are rural, and the Yangtze Basin region accounts for about&#13;
40 percent of the country's total agricultural and industrial output. The total navigable&#13;
length of the river system including tributaries exceeds 70,000 kin, about 60 percent of the&#13;
country's total. Annual average precipitation is 1,100 mm, concentrated almost entirely&#13;
between April and October, with the heaviest rainfall during June, July and August. Mos.&#13;
areas of the basin are affected by subtropical monsoons which come from both the&#13;
southeast and the southwest. Snowmelt runoff comprises less than 10 percent of the annual&#13;
stream flow.&#13;
2.3          The Yangtze River has been divided into three reaches: the upper reach&#13;
from the headwaters rising in the high mountains of Qinghai Province and passing through&#13;
Tibet, Yunnan and Sichuan down to Yichang City in Hubei, the site of an existing major&#13;
low-head power dam-Gezhouba-and shiplock, at the end of the famous Three Gorges;&#13;
the middle reach from Yichang descending some 1,000 km through large, low-lying&#13;
alluvial plains with many lakes to Poyang Lake; and the lower reach from Poyang Lake&#13;
to the sea north of Shanghai. The basin encompasses about 1.8 million kim2, almost 20&#13;
percent of the country. About 90 percent of flood volumes at Yichang are generated in&#13;
the upper Yangtze basin above Cuntan, and flood waters generated in the Three Gorges&#13;
area between Cuntan and Yichang are the main source of flash floods in the middle reach&#13;
where the project areas are located.&#13;
2.4          In the middle reach, the combination of hydrology and topography makes&#13;
the region prone to frequent severe and widespread flooding. As a result, it was sparsely&#13;
populated until the seventh century when migrants from the north began construction of&#13;
dikes, embankmnents and flood diversion works. Major floods in this century occurred in&#13;
1931, 1935 and 1954, and during 1954, 8 million ha were affected and 320,000 people&#13;
died. Dongting Lake is connected directly to the Yangtze River and plays an important&#13;
role as a diversion area for regulating Yangtze River floods in the region. Although this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
can lead to considerable flood losses in the Dongting area, it averts more widespread&#13;
serious flooding and possible dike failure in other areas. However, the size of Dongting&#13;
has been continuously shrinking (from 4350 km2 in 1949 to 2,691 km2 in 1983) due to&#13;
polderization and sedimentation from Yangtze flood waters diverted into the lake, and this&#13;
has progressively increased flooding in the region.&#13;
2.5          With rapid economic development, rising incomes, growing population, and&#13;
increasing land pressure in the basin, the need to provide better flood protection and&#13;
prevention measures is becoming increasingly urgent.  Timely and accurate flood&#13;
forecasting is essential to ensure correct operating decisions for diversion areas and for&#13;
major flood control reservoirs. An effective flood warning system is needed to warn the&#13;
population with as much lead time as possible. Mistakes and delays based on faulty data&#13;
and poor communications can cost billions of Yuan and many tens of thousands of lives.&#13;
The Yangtze Basin Comprehensive Development Plan gives top priority to improved flood&#13;
control in the middle and lower reaches, including nonstructural measures such as&#13;
improving meteorological and hydrological monitoring networks, flood forecasting, and&#13;
communications and warning for flood control.&#13;
2.6          Flood Control Infrastructure. Although dikes and embankments had been&#13;
constructed for centuries, flood protection along the Yangtze was given more impetus in&#13;
the 1950s, and in 1952 a flood protection program was launched for the Jingjiang Plain,&#13;
which is the rich and highly fertile area lying north of the Yangtze between Yichang and&#13;
Wuhan in Hubei. The Jingjiang Levee was constructed along 180 km of the left bank of&#13;
the Yangtze River in Hubei, and raised in some places to 16 m above normal river flows;&#13;
the Shashi flood retention basin in Hubei was completed; flood intake sluices, regulating&#13;
dams and retention basins were built on the right bank in the Dongting Lake region of&#13;
Hunan province; the multipurpose Danjiangkou Reservoir was built on the upper Han; and&#13;
other works were carried out to reinforce dikes on tributaries like the Han. On the&#13;
northern side, these works provide protection from floods with a return period of about 1&#13;
in 20 years to large cities and industries, and to about 2.0 million ha of irrigated land and&#13;
a population of about 25 million in the Jingjiang Plain between the Yangtze and Han&#13;
Rivers. However, the level of protection on the south side is generally less in order to&#13;
reduce flood levels at Wuhan, protecting only from four to seven year return interval&#13;
floods in the 400,000 ha of land reclaimed around Dongting Lake. The Lishui River is&#13;
also a primary contributor to Dongting Lake flooding and among all medium-size rivers&#13;
in China has had the most serious floods of this century. In the Lishui floods of 1935,&#13;
some 40,000 lives were lost; protection levels are still low, and the same flood today&#13;
would cause 150,000 deaths. The Lishui River and Dongting Lake area have had serious&#13;
floods in 33 out of the 44 years since 1949, which is a serious detriment to economic&#13;
growth in northern Hunan. Improved flood control in the Lishui Basin with the proposed&#13;
Jiangya Dam would contribute to Yangtze River flood protection and reduce flood levels&#13;
in Dongting Lake, and Jiangya is considered a national priority.&#13;
2.7          Yangtze (Chang Jiang) Water Resources Commission. The Yangtze&#13;
Water Resources Commission (YWRC) was established and headquartered in Wuhan in&#13;
1950 and is responsible for: collection and analysis of hydrological, geological and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
socioeconomic data; comprehensive water resource planning; design and construction of&#13;
medium and large water and hydropower projects; advising on river regulation; flood&#13;
control planning and operation in the middle and lower Yangtze; research and monitoring&#13;
of water resources, including environmental aspects; and implementation of water and soil&#13;
conservation works. It plays a key role in planning and design of large projects in the&#13;
Yangtze Basin, and a recent major activity has been investigation and design of the&#13;
proposed Three Gorges Dam.&#13;
Climate, Topography, and Soils&#13;
2.8          Climate. The project area has a continental monsoon, subtropical climate&#13;
with hot, humid summers and cool dry winters. Late summer drought is common to all&#13;
project areas with a frequency as high as one in two years, while flooding can be expected&#13;
in one of every four to five years. Average monthly temperature varies from 3°C in&#13;
January to 28°C in July, but temperatures commonly fall below freezing in the winter and&#13;
rise above 38°C in the summer. The average frost-free period is 230 to 270 days. Annual&#13;
average rainfall varies from about 840 mm to 1,300 mm, with most rain faling between&#13;
April and October. Selected climatological data are given in Annex 1, Table 1.&#13;
2.9          Topography and Soils. Topography varies considerably between project&#13;
areas, from dissected hills in the Liuduzhai and Tieshan areas in Hunan and parts of the&#13;
Dongfeng and Wenxia areas of Hubei to generaUy open sloping plains on the areas&#13;
adjacent to the Yangtze and Han Rivers in the other project areas. Soils vary from various&#13;
subgroups of weathered oxisols and ultisols, acid in reaction, in upland areas of Hubei and&#13;
Hunan to a range of paddy soils, broadly classified as anthropic hydruists which are&#13;
neutral to alkaline, in the established irrigation areas on the plains adjacent to major rivers.&#13;
The areas have been extensively mapped in terms of physical and chemical characteristics.&#13;
A repeated pattern of low nitrogen and phosphorus status is seen in all soils, while&#13;
potassium deficiency occurs naturaUy in upland red (oxisol, ultisol) soils and in the alluvial&#13;
irrigated soils after some years of intensive cropping. Micronutrient deficiencies (Zinc,&#13;
Boron and Molybdenum) also occur in all areas.&#13;
Socioeconomic Conditions&#13;
2.10         Population totals 54.5 milion in Hubei and 60.7 million in Hunan, of&#13;
which nearly 80 percent are rural. Per capita rural income in 1991 was Y 627 and Y 689,&#13;
respectively, compared to the national average of about Y 784. Average rural household&#13;
size is 4 to 5 people. Farm sizes are small, with only about 0.08 ha per capita in Hubei&#13;
and 0.07 ha per capita in Hunan. Hubei has 15 prefectures and 70 counties/municipalities,&#13;
of which 24 counties/municipalities are in the project area; Hunan has 14 prefectures/&#13;
municipalities and 107 counties, of which 9 (excluding the benefiting areas of Jiangya&#13;
Dam) are in the project area. In the project area counties and municipalities, population&#13;
totals about 9.2 million. Project areas in Hubei are already heavily irrigated and have an&#13;
average per capita income of Y 785. In Hunan, however, project areas at present have&#13;
little or no irrigation and average per capita income is only Y 377, with 17 percent of&#13;
households below the absolute poverty line (currently about Y 320 per capita).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Agriculture and Water Resources&#13;
2.11         Agriculture. Existing agricultural development is concentrated in valley&#13;
floors, although hill areas are used for irrigation in the Liuduzhai subproject area in&#13;
Hunan. Average cropping intensity exceeds 200 percent in both Hubei and Hunan, and&#13;
is determined by the reliability of irrigation water supply, length of growing season (mainly&#13;
determined by elevation) and adequacy of drainage. Below about 400 m elevation, warmer&#13;
temperatures allow triple cropping of early and late rice followed by rapeseed, wheat or&#13;
green manure. At higher elevations and with less reliable irrigation, rice is double cropped&#13;
with rapeseed or wheat. Smaller areas of spring maize, peanut and sesame are grown in&#13;
Hunan, while tubers and cotton are found in Hubei. Average yields of main crops are&#13;
relatively high-5.5 t/ha for paddy, 2.3 t/ha for wheat, and 1.1 t/ha for rapeseed in Hubei;&#13;
and 5.8 t/ha for paddy, 1.6 t/ha for wheat and 1.0 t/ha for rapeseed in Hunan. Hunan is&#13;
the largest provincial producer of rice in China, and Hubei is the fifth largest.&#13;
2.12         Rainfed cropping of mid-slope areas comprises annual spring and winter&#13;
sown species such as peanut, maize, brassicas and sweet potato with hand-watered&#13;
vegetables in household plots. Tea is cultivated in both Hunan and Hubei, and Hunan is&#13;
the second largest provincial producer of tea. Yields of tea are restricted by cultivation&#13;
at relatively low altitudes of around 400 m (in Hubei), poor management, and low fertilizer&#13;
use in both Provinces.&#13;
2.13         Livestock plays an important part in the farming system, providing meat,&#13;
eggs, milk and draft power, and also an important source of additional income. The main&#13;
livestock is pigs. Backyard pig and poultry production based on feeding of household&#13;
residues is common in the project areas, with a typical household fattening two or three&#13;
pigs per year and keeping about 12 chickens for home consumption. Higher mountain&#13;
areas in the north and west of Hubei are used for cattle breeding and act as a source of&#13;
yearling animals for fattening in the lowlands where sufficient high quality feed is&#13;
available.&#13;
2.14         Water Resources. Hubei and Hunan have large surface and groundwater&#13;
resources with thousands of rivers and streams. In Hubei, the largest water resources are&#13;
the Yangtze and Han Rivers, and the Sihu (four lakes) interlinked lake system in the&#13;
southwest. Hunan has four major rivers, the Xiangjiang, Zijiang, Yuanjiang, and Lishui;&#13;
most of the river flow in Hunan goes to Dongting Lake and thence into the Yangtze River.&#13;
Hubei and Hunan have about 2.6 million ha and 2.5 million ha of irrigation, most of which&#13;
is supplied from reservoirs; Hunan for example has over 13,000 small, medium and large&#13;
size reservoirs with total storage of 29 Bcm.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PRoJECT OBiECTIVE AND SCOPE&#13;
3.1           The main objectives of the project are to raise agricultural production and&#13;
incomes; reduce the risk and impact of floods; introduce a more sustainable and&#13;
cost-effective system for O&amp;M of irrigation and drainage schemes; and promote&#13;
institutional reform and strengthening and improve planning and environmental monitoring&#13;
in the water sector. Key institutional development objectives would be to introduce&#13;
comprehensive river basin management, and self-financing irrigation and drainage districts&#13;
based on farmer participation. This would promote cost recovery, decentrailization of&#13;
services delivery, and participation by users which are key elements of Government and&#13;
Bank water resources policy. The project will be the first Bank Group supported&#13;
comprehensive water resources operation in China.&#13;
3.2           The project would comprise two components covering various subprojects&#13;
in Hubei and Hunan.l1/ The salient features are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Hubei Component: (i) essential repair and rehabilitation works to upgrade four&#13;
existing irrigation schemes-Zhanghe, Dongfeng, Yindan, and Wenxia-with a&#13;
total benefiting area of 271,200 ha (Annex 1); (ii) improvement of flood control&#13;
over 336,000 ha and drainage facilities for some 28,000 ha in the Sihu area&#13;
(Annex 1); (iii) nonwater subprojects on aquaculture, forestry, grassland&#13;
development, and soil improvement (Annex 2); and (iv) institutional development&#13;
to establish self-financing irrigation districts and strengthen the Hubei Water&#13;
Resources Department (WRD).&#13;
(b)   Hunan  Component: (i) completion of two partly-constructed  irrigation&#13;
systems-Tieshan and Liuduzhai-covering an area of about 50,000 ha (Annex 1);&#13;
(ii) construction of the large Jiangya Multipurpose Dam mainly for flood control&#13;
and power in the Lishui River Basin (Annex 3); (iii) technical support and&#13;
research to improve design and management of Dongting Lake drainage facilities&#13;
covering some 250,000 ha (Annex 1); (iv) institutional development for&#13;
establishment of the Lishui Hydro and Power Corporation (LHPC), as&#13;
I/ The project originally included a third component, a modem Flood Forecasting and Waming System&#13;
(FFWS) for the middle Yangtze River Basin which was to be implemented by YWRC ($12.8 million,&#13;
including foreign exchange cost of $8.3 million). FFWS would have provided increased flood warning&#13;
protection for millions of people in the middle Yangtze Basin, and had a high estimated rate of return.&#13;
However, during loan negotiations, it was removed from the project at the request of the govenment&#13;
which decided to finance FFWS with internal resources (see Annex 5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
owner/operator of the Jiangya Multipurpose Dam and as manager of the Lishui&#13;
River Basin (Annex 4); and (v) institutional development to establish self-financing&#13;
irrigation districts (Annex 6) and strengthen the Project Management Office&#13;
(PMO) of the Hunan Hydro and Power Department (HPD).&#13;
B. HuBEi COMPONENT&#13;
Irrigation and Drainage Subprojects&#13;
3.3          Zhanghe Subproject ($19.9 million). The Zhanghe irrigation area lies&#13;
between Jingmen city and Chang Lake and is supplied by the Zhanghe Reservoir, which&#13;
was completed in 1966. All irrigation facilities down to village level are managed by the&#13;
Zhanghe Irrigation Authority. The project would rehabilitate the General Main Canal and&#13;
the irrigation system. Most project works would focus on No. 3 Main Canal and its&#13;
service area, including: (a) lining of 20 km, raising of embankments, construction of&#13;
retaining walls (where landslides occur frequently) and culverts, and repair or replacement&#13;
of structures for No. 3 Main Canal; (b) rehabilitation of 155 km of branch and subbranch&#13;
canals; (c) improvement of laterals, sublaterals and on-farm works including widening of&#13;
irrigation and drainage ditches and land levelling; and (d) rehabilitation of three medium&#13;
reservoirs in the service area by repairing embankments, grouting seepage areas, and&#13;
strengthening spillways. The project would improve O&amp;M by installation of a remote&#13;
monitoring and measurement system on the General Main Canal and measurement&#13;
equipment on the No. 3 Main Canal; water measuring devices; local and foreign training&#13;
and study tours; equipment including computers and vehicles; and a small research and&#13;
training center. Zhanghe would also be the first pilot area in Hubei for early establishment&#13;
of self-financing irrigation and drainage districts (SIDDs) comprising Water Supply&#13;
Corporations (WSCs) and farmer-managed Water User Associations (WUAs) which would&#13;
take over management of the subproject (paras. 3.23-3.24); the project would provide&#13;
support for this at Zhanghe from the first year of the project. Support under the project&#13;
for SIDD development would include buildings (mainly for WSCs and WUAs, as&#13;
necessary), equipment and vehicles, technical assistance, training and study tours.&#13;
3.4          Dongfeng Subproject ($20.3 million). The Dongfeng irrigation area is&#13;
located in western Hubei, just east of Yichang City and south of the Jingshan Mountains.&#13;
Dongfeng Irrigation Authority and local WRBs manage the main canals and Shangjiahe&#13;
Reservoir diversion, but not the two upstream reservoirs which provide most of the&#13;
storage. The project would: (a) repair Shangjiahe Dam by construction of a concrete&#13;
cut-off wall in the dam body; (b) implement works to increase flood discharge capacities&#13;
and remove structural defects in other reservoirs in the area (Baihe, Houshankou, Hujiafan,&#13;
Paoma and Shanxichun); (c) increase capacity and efficiency of the main conveyance&#13;
system; (d) line with concrete about 87 km of general main and branch canals; (e) improve&#13;
laterals and sublaterals for about 2,600 ha, including widening of irrigation and drainage&#13;
ditches and land levelling for low-yield land; and (f) repair or replace various structures&#13;
including 4 aqueducts (1.4 km), 42 tunnels (12 km) and a number of sluices, culverts,&#13;
cross regulators and farm bridges. To improve O&amp;M, the project would fund the&#13;
installation of a remote monitoring and control system on the general main canal and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
branch canals; water measuring devices on canals and reservoirs; more efficient radio and&#13;
communications systems; local and foreign training and study tours, equipment including&#13;
computers and vehicles, and management buildings. In addition, Dongfeng would be the&#13;
second SIDD pilot area and would establish a WSC and WUAs based on the lesson of&#13;
Zhanghe. Project support would include buildings, equipment, computers, vehicles,&#13;
technical assistance, training and study tours for the WSC; and farmer leader and WUA&#13;
organizer training, computers, motorcycles/vehicles, and construction and equipping of&#13;
small offices for WUAs.&#13;
3.5          Yindan Subproject ($24.8 million). The Yindan subproject is located in&#13;
the north of Hubei borderng Henan Province and extending south from the Danjiangkou&#13;
Reservoir, which supplies it, to the confluence of the Han and Tangbaihe Rivers. The&#13;
project would: (a) rehabilitate 55 km of the General Main Canal, including lining of 9.3&#13;
kni, construction of retaining walls where landslides have occurred, and repair or&#13;
replacement of a number of structures; (b) rehabilitate a total of 132 km of main canals&#13;
number 1,2,4 and 5, including lining of 4 kIn; and (c) repair or replace various structures&#13;
such as sluices, gates, bridges, check structures, siphons and aqueducts on main canals 1,&#13;
2, 4 and 5; (d) improve laterals, sublaterals, and on-farm works including widening of&#13;
irrigation and drainage ditches and land levelling; and (e) rehabilitate the medium size&#13;
Tengzhuang Reservoir by raising dam height, improving the spillway, protecting slopes&#13;
and constructing two gate chambers on the sluices. To improve operations, the project&#13;
would fund a remote monitoring system for the General Main Canal and branch canals;&#13;
water measuring devices on canals, reservoirs and offtakes; improved radio and&#13;
communications systems (including land lines); local and foreign training and study tours;&#13;
equipment including computers and vehicles; a research and training center; and&#13;
establishment of a WSC and WUAs based on the experience of Zhanghe.&#13;
3.6          Wenxia Subproject ($16.3 million). Wenxia subproject, served by the&#13;
Wenxia Reservoir, is located east of the Han River almost in the middle of Hubei. The&#13;
project would: (a) rehabilitate and improve 128 km of main canals, including rebuilding&#13;
collapsed sections, lining, slope protection and repairs to 23 tunnels; (b) rehabilitate similar&#13;
works on 10 branch canals, and repair or replace a number of existing structures such as&#13;
culverts, aqueducts, regulating gates and farm bridges and construct new structures where&#13;
required; (c) improve the capacity and reliability of eight pumping stations for irrigation&#13;
and drainage; and (d) undertake pilot scale improvement works on laterals and sublaterals&#13;
serving 2,200 ha. O&amp;M capability of the Wenxia Authority would be strengthened&#13;
through installation of water measuring devices on canals, reservoirs and offtakes;&#13;
improved radio and communications systems (including land lines); local and foreign&#13;
training and study tours; equipment including computers and vehicles; buildings; and&#13;
support for establishment of a WSC and WUAs.&#13;
3.7          Sihu Subproject ($43.5 million). The Sihu (Four Lakes) area is a large,&#13;
low-lying, plain in a loop of the Yangtze River between Shashi and Honghu cities,&#13;
bounded in the north and east by the Han and Dongjing Rivers. The Sihu Water&#13;
Management Bureau manages key facilities such as the Chang and Hong Takes, some of&#13;
the larger sluices, and the pump stations at the mouths of the Tianquan, Hongpaihe and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Xialeizing Rivers. Local WRBs and WMSs rmanage the smaller works. Project&#13;
investments would upgrade internal flood control works to provide the same level of&#13;
protection as the peripheral system (protection against a one in 50 year flood), remove&#13;
local bottlenecks in the drainage system, improve operations, and develop a computerized&#13;
optimization model for planning and operation of water control facilities in the lake.&#13;
3.8          Upgrading flood protection would include works to: (a) improve the Chang&#13;
Lake Dike, including raising and strengthening of a 28 km section, slope protection works&#13;
on 174,000 m2 of dikes, construction of a 13 km long wave break wall, improvement of&#13;
eight sluices, and concrete surfacing of the dike-top road; (b) improve Hong Lake Dike,&#13;
including raising and widening of 84 km of the dike, filling low areas, slope protection for&#13;
12 km of the dike and improvement of four sluice gates; and (c) increase the&#13;
discharge/flood handling capacity of the Tianguan River, including dredging of a 20 km&#13;
stretch to a 115 m bed width, raising and strengthening of embankments, improvement of&#13;
six sluices, building two new small pump stations on the left bank of the river, and lining&#13;
on a 1.0 km stretch of the river bank. To improve drainage, the project would (a) install&#13;
four second stage pumps in the Nantaogou area with a total capacity of 16 m3/sec; (b)&#13;
replace old pumps at Loaxin and Xingou by 10 new energy-saving pumps of 9 m3/sec&#13;
capacity each; and (c) construct local drainage networks, including subsurface drainage and&#13;
land levelling to improve about 28,000 ha of low-yield land.&#13;
3.9          The project would help improve operations by providing funds for radio&#13;
and communications systems; water measuring devices where appropriate; technical and&#13;
office equipment; vehicles; buildings; foreign and local training and study tours; a&#13;
management information system; and research by various research organizations in Hubei&#13;
on drainage and water management issues based on needs identified under the International&#13;
Program for Technology Research in Irrigation and Drainage (LPTRIID). These issues&#13;
include possible establishment and support of WUAs and possibly WSCs based on the&#13;
experience of Zhanghe suitably modified for drainage. The project would also support&#13;
upgrading of the existing mathematical model of Sihu to guide future improvement&#13;
planning and provide a basis for a future computerized real-time operating system of Sihu&#13;
area.&#13;
WRD Institutional Development Support&#13;
3.10         The project would provide support to strengthen the Hubei Provincial WRD&#13;
including establishment of the PMO and support for the Hubei Water Resources Design&#13;
Institute and Hubei Water Resources Research and Training Center, in addition to&#13;
institutional development support provided to WSCs and WIUAs at the individual&#13;
subprojects. Assistance to the WRD and its Design Institute would focus on upgrading&#13;
their capacity for sectoral management and planning and project planning and preparation,&#13;
promoting and assisting development of WSCs and WUAs, and providing backup support&#13;
to lower level WRBs on improved design, construction, and O&amp;M; the provincial WRD&#13;
would also coordinate and guide institutional development activities of the lower level&#13;
water agencies under the project. The project would fund technical assistance; local and&#13;
foreign training and study tours, including specialized work-study programs overseas;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
office equipment, including computers and peripheral equipment and software (including&#13;
computer assisted design and computerized project management), and specialized and field&#13;
equipment for field survey, water measurement, etc.; vehicles; strengthening of Research&#13;
and Training Center capacity to train technical staff from lower level institutions and&#13;
improve research activities; and construction of buildings. The Research and Training&#13;
Center would be strengthened and funded to assist WRD with SIDD development mainly&#13;
by organizing training courses for trainers, WUA organizers and WUA leaders; providing&#13;
special technical support and training to assist WSC establishment and help set up their&#13;
internal management systems; and monitor and evaluate the SIDD program. Training and&#13;
research for WRD and subprojects would be carried out under prior agreed technical&#13;
assistance programs (para. 3.45).&#13;
Nonwater Resources Subprojects&#13;
3.11         Aquaculture ($15.5 million). The aquaculture component would improve&#13;
aquaculture production in 24 counties/cities through investments to improve 17 small lakes,&#13;
rservoirs (some seasonal), covering a total surface area of 12,593 ha, and constructing or&#13;
improving about 900 ha of farm ponds which would directly benefit about 1,800&#13;
households in total. Small lake and reservoir improvement would include strengthening&#13;
and raising of existing embankments, construction of new dikes, installation of fish screens&#13;
at canal openings and sluice gates, construction of bridges and small farm&#13;
management/storage buildings, increasing stocking of fish, turtle, and crab seed, and&#13;
supply of feed and ferdlizer inputs. Pond development would include improvement of 205&#13;
ha of existing nursery and 365 ha of production ponds; and new construction of 117 ha of&#13;
nursery and 216 ha of production ponds. The nursery ponds would each have an area of&#13;
0.33 ha and the production ponds an area of 0.67 ha. Each pond would be have an&#13;
independent water supply and drainage canal and an electrical aerator. The project would&#13;
also finance construction of five fish hatcheries, one 4.2-ha turtle hatchery, one 1-ha turtle&#13;
farm, and a 1,000 m2 technical service and extension center; technical assistance, training,&#13;
and study tours; equipment and computers; vehicles; and establishment support for a&#13;
nongovemment, self-supporting Hubei Fish Farmers' Association.&#13;
3.12         Forestry Subproject ($10.2 million). The project would fund forestry&#13;
establishment over some 16,718 ha, comprising approximately 6000 ha of protection&#13;
forestry, 5000 ha of timber forestry, and 5718 ha of economic forestry in 11 of the 23&#13;
counties included for irrigation and drainage subprojects. Nearly 90 percent of all forests&#13;
planted would be by contracted households, with the remainder by government forest&#13;
farms. The project would also finance construction and equipping of a 800 m2 technical&#13;
training center, improvement and equipping of an existing training center, computers and&#13;
equipment, vehicles, technical assistance, training and research. Fertilizer procurement&#13;
for forestry would be combined with the soil improvement component (para. 3.14).&#13;
3.13         Grasslands/Cattle Improvement Subproject ($13.1 million). The project&#13;
would include improvement of 19,525 ha of grasslands for cattle fattening, comprising&#13;
8,110 ha in lowlands (including irrigation and drainage) and 11,415 ha in uplands. It&#13;
would also strengthen the capacity of the Provincial Livestock Breeding Station to supply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
improved breed semen for artificial insemination of some 20,700 breeding cows to be&#13;
owned by 13,500 households in areas supplying young stock for fattening on project&#13;
grassland areas; and provide for extension, research, training, study tours and technical&#13;
assistance. The project would support household settlement on areas of 1 ha (lowland)&#13;
or 2 ha (upland) for fattening of yearling (100 kg) cattle over a 12 month period. Water&#13;
supply (wells) would be proven before expenditures on grasslands development begins at&#13;
each site.&#13;
3.14         Soil Improvement Subproject ($11.1 million). The project would develop&#13;
the nucleus of a supporting fertilizer industry by financing six fertilizer blending plants of&#13;
30,000 tons/yr capacity and associated storage capacity at the plants, fertilizer supply&#13;
stations including storage in participating counties, research institutes, computers and&#13;
equipment, vehicles, and technical assistance, research, and training (including training of&#13;
county/city agricultural technicians in water management). It would also support capacity&#13;
building in Agriculture Bureaus at county level in the irrigation and drainage subproject&#13;
areas to identify soil fertility problems, provide accurate diagnosis of available nutrient&#13;
deficiencies, and extend appropriate solutions via balanced fertilizer recommendations.&#13;
C. HuNAN COMPONENT&#13;
Jiangya Multipurpose Dam&#13;
3.15         Jiangya Multipurpose Dam ($290.2 million) would be located near Jiangya&#13;
Town in Cili County, on the Loushui River in the Lishui River Basin. One of the four&#13;
largest rivers in Hunan, the Lishui River has had the worst floods of this century among&#13;
medium size rivers in China, and it is a primary source of widespread flooding in the&#13;
low-lying area west of Dongting Lake. This area has a high concentration of population&#13;
and is an important center for agricultural and industrial production, and frequent flooding&#13;
there affects both large numbers of people and economic growth and development in&#13;
Hunan. To reduce flooding risks, the Hunan Government has decided to construct several&#13;
dams in the Lishui Basin: first Jiangya Dam, to be followed by the Zaoshi and&#13;
Yichongqiao Dams in the future. Studies indicate that Jiangya will give the largest and&#13;
most immediate reduction in flooding damage. Its completion for flood protection by 1997&#13;
has been promised by national leaders after recent large flood losses; this is one reason for&#13;
use of roller compacted concrete (RCC) technology, which is the most rapid construction&#13;
method for large concrete dams now known. China is a leader in RCC dam construction.&#13;
3.16         The main purpose of Jiangya is flood control. It would also include 300&#13;
MW of hydropower capacity and a boatlift located on the left bank which would&#13;
accommodate boats of 20 tons and an estimated annual volume of 40,000 tons. The dam&#13;
would be a RCC gravity type with maximum dam height of 128 m, crest length of 336 m,&#13;
and total concrete volume of 1.4 Mcm. At completion, it would be one of the world's&#13;
highest and largest RCC dams. The overall storage capacity would be 1.7 Bcm, of which&#13;
740 Mcm would be reserved for flood control. Some 950 ha of farm land would be&#13;
inundated and about 12,587 people would be relocated. The silt load of the river is low,&#13;
and the reservoir life should exceed 200 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.17         The project would finance all or part of the preliminary and diversion&#13;
works, the dam body and spillway, power facilities, turbines and generators, resettlement,&#13;
and specialized technical assistance. The dam would have a central overflow spillway&#13;
section 86.5 m long, flanked by higher sections near each abutment. To help ensure safe&#13;
and optimal operation of the dam, a flood forecasting system would be installed upstream&#13;
and linked to a warning system for the reservoir freeboard zone, where new construction&#13;
would also be restricted. The project would also fund international technical assistance for&#13;
implementation, a local firm as the "Project Engineer" for construction supervision of the&#13;
dam, a Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP), Environment and Resettlement Panel, and other&#13;
local and foreign expert consultants. Jiangya would be constructed, owned and operated&#13;
by the Lishui Hydro and Power Corporation (LHPC), which is jointly owned by Hunan&#13;
and MWR. LHPC selected and appointed a qualified local firm as Project Engineer before&#13;
Board presentation. Agreement was reached at negotiations that LHPC would appoint the&#13;
internationalproject consultantfirm by September 30, 1995, and that the international and&#13;
local consultants would be employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/IDA.&#13;
Irrigation and Drainage Subprojects&#13;
3.18         Tieshan Subproject ($41.7 million). The project would fund construction&#13;
of a new irrigation system located in the north Tieshan area east of Dongting Lake, and&#13;
served by the existing Tieshan Reservoir.  The Tieshan Reservoir Water Supply&#13;
Corporation (TRWSC) would be responsible for construction and O&amp;M of the Tieshan&#13;
subproject, which would include: (a) construction of a 28 km extension of the main canal&#13;
for irrigation supply to 25,800 ha, including 17 tunnels (3.2 km), 9 aqueducts (1.8 km),&#13;
and culverts, gates and other structures; (b) construction of two submain canals (24 km)&#13;
and two branch canals (total 28 km); (c) construction of laterals and sublaterals to serve&#13;
areas which cannot be supplied from branch canals through the existing distribution&#13;
network; (d) support to farmers for on-farm improvements to handle the increased supply&#13;
of water; and (e) construction of a canal (2.2 km), tunnel (3.5 kIn), and new storage&#13;
reservoir (10 Mcm) for supply of municipal water to Yueyang City. For improved O&amp;M,&#13;
the project would finance remote monitoring, automation and control for the main and&#13;
branch canals; water measuring devices on canals, reservoirs, and offtakes; improved radio&#13;
and communications systems; office and field management buildings; equipment and&#13;
computers; vehicles; local and foreign training and study tours; and specialized local and&#13;
international technical assistance. Under the project, Tieshan would be the first SIDD pilot&#13;
project site in Hunan, and the project would provide institutional development support for&#13;
TRWSC and for WUAs from year one of the project.&#13;
3.19         Liuduzhai Subproject ($38.9 million).  The project would fund&#13;
construction of a new irrigation system to be served by the existing Liuduzhai Dam located&#13;
in central Hunan in one of the poorest regions of the province. The Liuduzhai Irrigation&#13;
Management Authority currently manages the dam and would be converted to a WSC&#13;
under the project. The project would include: (a) 18 km of main canal, including a head&#13;
regulator (capacity 14.5 m3/sec), three major tunnels (2.9 km), four aqueducts (0.6 km),&#13;
a small power station and other structures such as culverts and gates; (b) three submain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
canals with a total length of 91 km; (c) a pump station and canal at Jishi to lift water 33&#13;
m and deliver it to irrigate some 1,650 ha in the northern part of the subproject; (d) 88&#13;
branch canals, mainly to supply water into the existing network of lower level irrigation&#13;
channels; (e) lateals and sublaterals to supply areas which cannot be supplied directly from&#13;
the subbranch canals; and (f) on-farm works to handle the increased supply of water, to&#13;
be carried out by farmers. For improved O&amp;M, the project would finance a remote&#13;
monitoring system on the main canal and branch canals; water measuring devices on&#13;
canals, reservoirs and offtakes; improved radio and communications systems; construction&#13;
of office and management buildings and a small training center; equipment and computers;&#13;
vehicles; local and foreign training and study tours; and specialized local and international&#13;
technical assistance. The project would also support development of the Liuduzhai WSC&#13;
and WUAs, starting on a pilot basis in year one of the project. The WSC would gradually&#13;
take over responsibility for the system and would create and support WUAs based on the&#13;
experience of the Tieshan and Hubei pilot projects.&#13;
3.20         Dongting Lake Research Subproject ($2.5 million). The project would&#13;
fund the preparation of a mathematical model to optimize the operation and management&#13;
of the Dongting Lake drainage schemes (Annex 1). The model would be designed to help&#13;
in the design of future interventions and provide the basis for a computerized, real-time&#13;
operating system.  The project would also include a three-year study to improve&#13;
rainfall-runoff modeling and real-time flood forecasting in the Dongting area, and support&#13;
design and preparation work for improved flood forecasting, warning and communication.&#13;
The project would finance computing equipment, software, training, technical assistance&#13;
and research based on needs identified through HPrRID. YWRC would assist Hunan with&#13;
design of the Dongting flood forecasting and warning system.&#13;
Lishui HIydro and Power Corporation Strengthening&#13;
3.21         Under the project, LHPC would be assisted and strengthened for&#13;
construction and operation of Jiangya Dam and for overall management of the Lishui River&#13;
Basin ($2.4 million), including environmental management. For LHPC strengthening, the&#13;
project would finance equipment, vehicles, technical assistance, studies, research, and&#13;
foreign and local training and study tours. Training and research would be carried out&#13;
under prior agreed programs. Priority would be given to: (a) development of internal&#13;
management systems; (b) development of external (basin) management systems, including&#13;
support to establish LHPC's Environment and Resettlement Department (ERD); (c) four&#13;
special studies (pricing and cost recovery, investment plans and financing, multi-reservoir&#13;
optimization, and environment); (d) preparation of corporate operating rules and terms of&#13;
reference for management positions; (e) specialized technical assistance; and (f) equipping&#13;
of LBPC offices (Annex 4).&#13;
Strengthening of the Provincial Project Management Office&#13;
3.22         The project would provide support to the PMO of Hunan HPD to upgrade&#13;
capacity for water resource planning and project preparation, and for providing backup to&#13;
lower level agencies on design and facilities for improved O&amp;M and SIDD development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
($1.4 million). Project funds would be made available for various technical and office&#13;
equipment, including computer assisted design; office and training equipment; vehicles;&#13;
consultants, research and studies; and foreign and local training and study tours. Overseas&#13;
training would also be funded, mostly to cover areas related to operation of self-financing&#13;
irrigation districts, O&amp;M and planning and development of large irrigation and drainage&#13;
areas, including issues related to environmental and water quality control; this would&#13;
include specially designed work-study and course programs, both degree and nondegree.&#13;
Provision would also be made for local and foreign technical assistance. HPD would also&#13;
play a key role in the program to create WSCs and WUAs. Funds would be provided for&#13;
HPD to monitor the program, recruit foreign experts, and fund local and foreign study&#13;
tours, training and foreign work-study. HPD would also provide technical support to&#13;
WSCs on WUA organization and WSC internal management systems, and would also&#13;
organize training courses for the master trainers who would train WUA organizers and&#13;
WUA leaders. Training and research, for both HPD and subprojects, would be carried out&#13;
under prior agreed programs.&#13;
D. SELF-nFNANCING IRRIGAnON AND DRAINAGE DISTRcrS&#13;
3.23         As the Chinese economy becomes more market-oriented, the long-run&#13;
sustainability of irrigation and drainage will depend increasingly on self-financing of&#13;
irrigation facilities and operations. The proposed project would promote development of&#13;
a new concept of self-financing irrigation and drainage districts (SIDDs), through which&#13;
existing irrigation districts would be converted into legal, self-financing entities (Annex 6).&#13;
Key ingredients in achieving the latter are to provide unified management which is based&#13;
on hydraulic (not administrative) boundaries for efficiency, and is responsive to the users&#13;
and demand; and to give more management responsibility and control to the farmers/users&#13;
who have the greatest interest in the success of water resource facilities under the project.&#13;
3.24         Support under the project for SIDD establishment is built into each&#13;
subproject, and would start initially in Zhanghe subproject in Hubei and Tieshan subproject&#13;
in Hunan (paras. 4.10-4.12, para. 5.19 and Annex 6). Based on experience with these&#13;
pilot subprojects, SIDD concepts and procedures would be refined and applied to other&#13;
water resource subprojects gradually. SIDD establishment would involve institutional&#13;
development at two levels: (a) the overall subproject or system level, where a Water&#13;
Supply Corporation (WSC) would be established with unified responsibility for the&#13;
irrigation system and its O&amp;M, similar to TRWSC already established at Tieshan; and&#13;
(b) the hydraulic unit level within the system, where Water User Associations (WUAs)&#13;
would be established and managed by farmers. WSCs and WUAs would be organized as&#13;
hydraulic units (e.g., by canal or lateral), not according to administrative (e.g., county)&#13;
boundaries. For irrigation subprojects, project financing would include construction of&#13;
management buildings, equipment, computers, vehicles, training, study tours, and&#13;
consultancy services to support development of WSCs and WUAs, and installation of water&#13;
measuring devices for canals, offtakes and reservoirs. WSCs would gradually take over&#13;
the responsibilities of the present Management Authorities and the local WRBs for&#13;
construction of project works and O&amp;M of the subprojects, and they would be responsible&#13;
for establishment, monitoring and support of WUAs. Before construction, farmer groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
would have to agree voluntarily to form legal WUAs, contribute to construction of the&#13;
system, and assume responsibility for O&amp;M including full responsibility for their local&#13;
system and payment of specified water fees to the WSC. The provincial WRB would assist&#13;
through training, technical assistance, development, and monitoring of procedures and&#13;
processes for WSC and WUA establishment and operation, and preparation of model&#13;
Articles of Association for the WSCs and model By-Laws for the WUAs, which would&#13;
include representation of women. Agreement was reached at negotiations that Hubei and&#13;
Hunan would prepare and adopt time-bound implementation plans by December 31, 1995&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank/lIDA for establishment and operation of WSCs and WUAs, and&#13;
thereafter carry out the implementation plans in a manner satisfactory to the Bank/IDA.&#13;
Plans, timetables and arrangements for technical assistance to prepare model Articles,&#13;
By-Laws and Agreements were discussed and agreed at negotiations.&#13;
E. AGRICULTURE SUPPORT FOR IRRIGATION AND DRANAGE&#13;
3.25         Agricultural support (extension, training, ferdlizer, agro-chemicals, seeds&#13;
and credit) for irrigation subprojects is necessary in Hubei and Hunan. In Hubei, 20&#13;
percent of the project areas for the agriculture (fertilizer) and irrigation subprojects overlap&#13;
to combine agricultural and irrigation benefits. In Hunan, both irrigation subprojects are&#13;
presently unirrigated, and farmers have limited experience with irrigation. Agricultural&#13;
support would be provided by the provinces and monitored during Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
F. WATR SUPPLY, DEMAN  AN  QuALrr=&#13;
3.26         Detailed water balance studies for all irrigation subprojects were carried&#13;
out including supply and demand for the different water usages (agricultural, rural and&#13;
urban and industrial). For agriculture, crop water requirements were calculated using&#13;
day-to-day calculations of field irrigation requirements by Hubei and Hunan Design&#13;
Institutes based on effective rainfall, field efficiencies, daily percolation in paddy fields,&#13;
runoff into the thousands of ponds and numerous small and medium size reservoirs, and&#13;
usable flows from these ponds and reservoirs. Results of water balance calculations show&#13;
that water demands in the different subprojects can be met with more than 90 percent&#13;
reliability after the improvements under the project, which would improve the conveyance&#13;
and the distribution efficiencies of the irrigation systems.  Detailed water balance&#13;
calculations are summarized in Annex 1. Water quality in all the irrigation subprojects is&#13;
suitable for agriculture use (Classes II and Im). For domestic use treatment would be&#13;
required. Monitoring and reporting of water quality would be undertaken by Provincial&#13;
WRBs and Environmental Departments.&#13;
G. STATUS OF PREPARATION, DESIGN AND DAM SAT&#13;
Hubei and Hunan Components&#13;
3.27         Irrigation and Drainage Subprojects. In Hubei, designs are at advanced&#13;
feasibility level, and over 600 drawings have been completed. In Hunan, most of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
detailed designs and drawings were prepared in the late 1980s before construction was&#13;
stopped or slowed due to lack of funds. Provincial and prefectural design institutes are&#13;
responsible for system and large canal and structure designs; county water resource&#13;
bureaus are responsible for lateral and sublateral designs. Designs follow MWR and&#13;
Provincial standards. Design improvements to be introduced or tested under the project&#13;
include flexible geo-membranes for stabilization of canal side slopes in swelling soils in&#13;
Hubei; use of steel gates which would be easier to operate and more amenable to future&#13;
motorization, automation, and upgrading of operation; canal automation including remote&#13;
monitoring of water levels in canals and medium size reservoirs and flows in canals (using&#13;
local processors); radio/VHF communications systems; and water measuring devices on&#13;
canals, in-system reservoirs, and offtakes. Designs and standards would be updated and&#13;
improved as required to incorporate such innovations.&#13;
3.28         Jiangya Dam. Detailed designs for the dam have been prepared to the&#13;
standard required for ICB bidding by the Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute, and&#13;
several other research and design institutes have carried out specialized studies. The East&#13;
China Investigation and Design Institute prepared the ICB bid documents and will&#13;
undertake bid evaluation, assisted by international consultants employed by LHPC. MWR&#13;
has employed specialist organizations to assist it in carrying out its own design review of&#13;
the dam, and Hunan has appointed a Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP) for the dam.&#13;
Preparation of the resettlement program is complete, and implementation is underway.&#13;
3.29         Dam Safety. Jiangya Dam has been subjected to a dam safety review by&#13;
DSRP which met in September 1993 and April 1994. No safety issues have been&#13;
identified, but DSRP is scheduled to meet again in May 1995 and will continue to monitor&#13;
dam safety aspects of Jiangya during construction. DSRP comprises twelve recognized&#13;
experts with wide experience in all aspects of karstic geology and dam engineering,&#13;
including three international members with expertise in geotechnical engineering associated&#13;
with dams, spillway hydraulics and RCC dam design and construction. In Hubei, 11&#13;
medium and three large project-related dams have safety problems. These problems have&#13;
been fully investigated and remedial repair works have been designed and agreed. Repair&#13;
of the 11 medium sized dams is included for financing under the irrigation and drainage&#13;
subprojects; repair of the three large dams has already begun and is jointly financed by the&#13;
central and provincial governments. Progress on repair of these dams would be monitored&#13;
under the project. Agreements were reached at negotiations that: (a) the Borrower would:&#13;
(i) cause periodic inspection, and cause independent experts to inspect, Jiangya Dam and&#13;
associated works and structures, and project-related dams and related structures, in&#13;
accordance with sound engineering practices to determine whether there are any&#13;
deficiencies in the condition of the structures or maintenance or methods of operation that&#13;
may endanger their safety; and rii) provide to the Bank/IDA, one year prior to completion&#13;
of Jiangya Dam and other dams, respectively, a satisfactory program for maintenance of&#13;
the dams and related structures; (b) Hubei and Hunan would ensure that all dams related&#13;
to or rehabilitated under the project exceeding 10 m in height or 2.5 Mcm in storage&#13;
volume would be subject to a dam safety review and subsequently maintained, operated and&#13;
inspected periodically in accordance with sound engineering practice, under arrangements&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank/lIDA; (c) Hunan would ensure that LHPC operates and maintains&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
the DSRP for Jiangya Dam satisfactory to the Bank/IDA; and (d) LHPC would. (i)&#13;
maintain the Jiangya DSRP of independent experts, with composition and functions&#13;
acceptable to the Bank/lIDA, to conduct periodic safety reviews of the design and technical&#13;
specifications of the Jiangya Dam and related structures, and to report on such reviews to&#13;
the Borrower and the Bank/IDA; (ii) prepare, one year prior to completion of the dam, a&#13;
satisfactory program for maintenance of the dam; and (iii) ensure that the dam is&#13;
maintained, operated and periodically inspected after construction in accordance with&#13;
sound engineering and dam safety practices, under arrangements satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/IDA.&#13;
3.30         Nonwater Resource Subprojects.  Works associated with nonwater&#13;
subprojects are relatively minor, and feasibility designs have been prepared for all&#13;
subprojects. Feasibility studies have been completed, and preliminary technical designs&#13;
are generally at an advanced stage. Detailed technical designs would be prepared during&#13;
implementation.&#13;
H. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.31         The project would be implemented over six years from mid-1995 to 2001&#13;
(Chart 1). Preparation support under a Policy and Human Resources Development Grant&#13;
from the Government of Japan has assisted more complete preparation, which should&#13;
facilitate implementation start-up. Irrigation and drainage subprojects and nonwater&#13;
subprojects in Hubei would be completed by mid-2000. Jiangya would be fully completed&#13;
in five years, with the dam body ready for flood control by April 1997 and fully complete&#13;
by September 1999, and the powerhouse and generating units in operation in 1999. The&#13;
completion date for the overall project would be December 31, 2000, and the closing date&#13;
for the loan/credit would be December 31, 2001. Agreement was reached at negotiations&#13;
that Hubei, Hunan, and LHPC wouldfurnish to the Bank/IDA for its review by December&#13;
31 of each year commencing on December 31, 1995, and thereafter implement, proposed&#13;
work plans and annual budgets for implementation of the project in the following year&#13;
taking into account Bank/IDA comments.&#13;
I. ENVIRONmENT AND RESETrLEmENT&#13;
3.32         Environment. The project as a whole is classed as a Category A&#13;
development for the Bank Group's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) purposes,&#13;
mainly due to the Jiangya Dam and reservoir component. The EIA was prepared by the&#13;
Research Institute for Water Resources Protection of the Yangtze under YWRC (Annex&#13;
7). The final EIA report, incorporating Bank Group comments, was received by the Bank&#13;
Group in April 1994, and the Summary EIA has been submitted to the Bank Group's&#13;
Public Information Center. For Jiangya, potential adverse impacts are limited by the&#13;
remote location, degraded catchment conditions due to a long history of occupation and&#13;
exploitation and lack of significant urban or industrial development in the catchment. The&#13;
five rare and endangered flora species that will be affected are well represented outside the&#13;
area. For irrigation subprojects, potential adverse impacts are very limited because the&#13;
investments are mainly for rehabilitation. However, there are several environmental issues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
at Sihu, for which the project is not responsible but which it would assist; in particular,&#13;
low-lying areas would be filled with dredge spoil from the project to reduce snail and&#13;
mosquito breeding areas for schistosomiasis and malaria control. In addition, Sihu faces&#13;
many development pressures unrelated to the project which may threaten local water&#13;
quality, and a specialized environmental study would be financed under the project. A&#13;
comprehensive Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) has been&#13;
prepared covering both Jiangya and Sihu (Annex 7).  LHPC has established an&#13;
Environment and Resettlement Panel (ERP) for Jiangya Dam, and would implement the&#13;
EMMP for Jiangya and monitor environmental conditions in the Lishui Basin.&#13;
3.33         Resettlement ($38.3 million). Jiangya Dam will require resettlement of&#13;
12,587 people in two counties in Hunan and one in Hubei. An additional 3,196 people,&#13;
who will lose their land but not their housing, will also receive economic rehabilitation.&#13;
The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for Jiangya was prepared by Wuhan University of&#13;
Hydraulic and Electrical Engineering, the Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute, and&#13;
YWRC, and Benchmark Targets for resettlement progress have been agreed and are being&#13;
monitored (Annex 7). Already, 567 people have been resettled from the dam site. The&#13;
remaining resettlement would be done in five stages: to elevation 138 m (421 people) by&#13;
April 1995; 138-160 m (3,574 people) by September 1995; 160-200 m first group (2,050&#13;
people) by December 1995 and second group (3,363 people) by December 1996; and&#13;
200-236 m (3,179 people) by December 1997. Some 29 village sites and six market&#13;
towns would be developed. About 75 percent of the people would be given farmland at&#13;
higher elevations to grow fruits, tea and Chinese medicinal herbs; 19 percent would get&#13;
jobs in township and village enterprises, and 6 percent would be employed in aquaculture&#13;
and grain farming. LHPC would be responsible for the overall implementation of Jiangya&#13;
Dam resettlement, and would make agreements with Resettlement Bureaus in the affected&#13;
counties to carry out their respective resettlement plans. LHPC has contracted with Wuhan&#13;
University for supervision and monitoring of the RAP and has established an Environment&#13;
and Resettlement Panel (ERP). Agreements were reached at negotiations that: (a) the&#13;
Borrower would take all steps necessary to ensure that Hubei, Hunan and LHPC carry out&#13;
their respective parts of the EMMP and RAP; (b) Hubei and Hunan would cause the&#13;
affected counties to enter into appropriate agreements with LHPC satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/IDA by September 30, 1995, to carry out the RAP and to maintain their resettlement&#13;
offices with adequate and competent staff acceptable to the Bank/IDA to implement the&#13;
RAP; (c) Hubei would carry out its responsibilities under the EMMP with respect to the&#13;
Sihu subproject; (d) Hunan would take all steps necessary to ensure that LHPC carries out&#13;
its responsibilities under the EMMP and RAP; and (e) LHPC would (i) operate and&#13;
maintain the ERP with respect to the EMMP and RAP andfor Jiangya Dam; (ii) maintain&#13;
its ERD with competent staff in adequate numbers and functions acceptable to the&#13;
Bank/IDA, to manage, coordinate and monitor the implementation of the EMMP and the&#13;
RAP; (iii) ensure that all actvities for its parts of the project comply with environrmental&#13;
guidelines satisfactory to the Bank/IDA; (iv) take all necessary measures to mitigate&#13;
adverse environmental impacts caused by the dam construction; and (v) implement the&#13;
EMMP and RAP in a timely manner. Disbursement by LHPC to counties of Y 20 million&#13;
by December 31, 1994 was a condition of negotiations, and satisfactory progress on&#13;
Jiangya resettlement according to agreed Benchmark Targets as on March 15, 1995 (Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
7, Appendix A), was a condition of Board presentation; both conditions were met&#13;
satisfactorily.&#13;
3.34         Resettlement at Tieshan (853 people) and Liuduzhai (651 people) was&#13;
satisfactorily completed well before the proposed project; construction had been started&#13;
several years earlier and then stopped. Resettlement for irrigation and drainage subprojects&#13;
in Hubei is minimal (135 people at Sihu), mainly involving short back moves which would&#13;
be accommodated by local redistribution of land, because the subprojects are for&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement of existing works.&#13;

K. FINANCING&#13;
3.37           The proposed Bank Loan and IDA Credit of $100 million and SDR 74.8&#13;
million ($110 million equivalent) would finance 36 percent of total project costs. The&#13;
remaining 64 percent would be financed by the Central, Provincial and local governments&#13;
and farmers as indicated in Table 3.2. Before negotiations, certification was received that&#13;
the People's Construction Bank of China agreed to provide $44 million of financing for&#13;
Jiangya Dam.&#13;

including a 5 year grace period. The commitment charges and foreign exchange risk for&#13;
their respective parts of the credit/loan would be borne by Hubei and Hunan Provinces.&#13;
Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower would onlend the proceeds of the&#13;
Credit and the Loan to Hubei and Hunan at 4 percent interest and an overall maturity of&#13;
20 years with 5 years of grace and level principalpayments, and that Hunan would onlend&#13;
part of the proceeds to LHPC under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/IDA. Execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between Hunan and LHPC is a&#13;
condition of loan/credit effectiveness.&#13;

General&#13;
3.39         Hubei and Hunan will manage procurement for their respective project&#13;
components. Procurement arrangements and costs for each component are detailed in&#13;
Annex 9, Tables 1, 2, and 3 and summarized in Table 3.3 for the project as a whole.&#13;
Costs for land acquisition, administration and management would be locally funded.&#13;
Procurement agents have been selected and are the International Tendering Company of&#13;
the China National Instruments Import and Export Corporation and the China International&#13;
Tendering Company of the China National Technical Import Corporation for Hubei; and&#13;
the International Tendering Company of the China National Instruments Import and Export&#13;
Corporation, CMC Intemational Tendering Co. of the China National Machinery Import&#13;
and Export Corporation, and China International Tendering Company of the China&#13;
National Technical Import Corporation for Hunan.&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
3.40         Jiangya Dam ($154.4 million). Jiangya Dam is considered an urgent&#13;
national priority for flood protection. Procurement for the main dam body is nearly&#13;
complete after review and approval by the Bank Group of tender documents for&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) and the bid evaluation. Contracts for preliminary&#13;
works, including diversion tunnels, dam site preparation and access roads ($18.3 million)&#13;
were awarded in 1993, and contracts for cofferdams, river closure, dam foundation&#13;
excavation and related civil works ($10.7 million) were awarded in September 1994; all&#13;
followed local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group. The&#13;
main international civil works contract for RCC dam construction (about $70.0 million),&#13;
including foundation construction, RCC dam construction, consolidation and curtain&#13;
grouting and cutoff works, and instrumentation and flood forecasting and warning facilities,&#13;
would be procured through ICB; to increase competition, the borrower elected not to offer&#13;
a margin for domestic preference. ICB tender documents for the dam were issued on&#13;
September 20, 1994, and bids were opened on December 19, 1994; the ICB contract will&#13;
be awarded shortly, and construction should start in October 1995. Contracts for other&#13;
works such as power facilities, including excavation of the underground powerhouse and&#13;
tunnels, and for the boatlift ($23.6 million) would be packaged where feasible and&#13;

less than $20,000, up to an aggregate amount of $3.5 million.&#13;
3.41         LHPC would ensure that contracts on the dam for cofferdam construction&#13;
and foundation excavation (LCB) and the main contract for dam construction (ICB) include&#13;
provisions for efficient interface between LCB contractors and the ICB contractor, in order&#13;
to guarantee proper engineering standards and avoid delays and claims by the ICB&#13;
contractor. LBPC has employed the East China Investigation and Design Institute, which&#13;
has had experience on at least three other Bank-financed projects, and other institutions and&#13;
experts to assist them with tender specification, bid evaluation, and supervision of ICB&#13;
bidding for the dam civil works contract.&#13;
3.42         Other Civil Works ($154.0 million). Civil works other than Jiangya Dam&#13;
include canals and canal structures, on-farm works, dikes, and nonwater works. Such&#13;
works are at scattered locations in seven irrigation and drainage subproject areas and 34&#13;
counties/municipalities and would not attract international bidders. Contracts for these&#13;
works would be packaged where feasible and procured through LCB following procedures&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank Group. Contracts for smaller works (such as small canals, land&#13;
development and minor site preparation) estimated at less than $50,000 in value per&#13;
contract up to an aggregate of $7.5 million for Hubei and $5.0 for Hunan may be procured&#13;
through local shopping based on comparison of at least three quotations; or through force&#13;
account for very small simple works (mainly small local canals and drains, on-farm works&#13;
and land development and levelling, to be done by local farmers) valued at less than&#13;
$20,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of $20.0 million for Hubei and $10.0&#13;
million for Hunan. To the extent practicable, such works would be grouped into bid&#13;
packages estimated to cost $50,000 or more.&#13;

procured through ICB as much as possible. Packages above $200,000 in value would be&#13;
procured through ICB procedures, in which a domestic preference margin of 15 percent&#13;
would be given to local manufactures. Construction materials cement and steel would be&#13;
packaged and procured through ICB. Standard equipment (e.g., steel canal gates), and&#13;
other goods and materials would be grouped into packages of $50,000 or more and&#13;
procured through LCB following procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group, up to an&#13;
aggregate of $16.0 million for Hubei and $8.0 million for Hunan; as such items would be&#13;
procured in relatively small lots and at various times for the different subprojects and&#13;
components, they would not be of interest to foreign suppliers. Larger contracts for&#13;
specialized items, such as grass seed, feeder calves, fish seed, breeding stock and other&#13;
items of comparable nature acceptable to the Bank Group, up to an aggregate of $5.0&#13;
million for Hubei, may also be procured through international and local shopping based&#13;
on comparison of at least three quotations. For contracts/packages valued $50,000 or less&#13;
up to an aggregate amount of $1.5 million for Hubei and $1.2 million for Hunan,&#13;
international or local shopping based on comparison of at least three quotations would be&#13;
used.&#13;
3.45         Consultant Services/Technical Assistance, Research and Training ($22.5&#13;
million). Consultant services and technical assistance would be procured according to&#13;
Bank Group Guidelines for Use of Consultants. Research, training and study tours would&#13;
be procured by procedures acceptable to the Bank. The firm(s)/organization(s) to provide&#13;
technical assistance for implementation of Jiangya Dam would be selected through&#13;
international competition. TA under the project would be for institutional capacity building&#13;
and implementation support. Agreement was reached at negotiations that Hubei, Hunan,&#13;
and LHPC would carry out all research, studies, and training, including study tours and&#13;
work-study, under the project in accordance with a program satisfactory to the Bank/IDA;&#13;
and provide to the Bank/IDA by June 30 of each year plans for these activities during the&#13;
coming year, commencing on June 30, 1995.&#13;

3.47         For civil works, the loan/credit would be disbursed against: (a) 75 percent&#13;
of qualified expenditures on the main Jiangya Dam works and 50 percent of other qualified&#13;
local expenditures for Jiangya Dam works in Hunan; (b) 30 percent of local expenditures&#13;
for irrigation and drainage subprojects in Hunan; and (c) 40 percent of local expenditures&#13;
for irrigation and drainage subprojects and nonwater subprojects in Hubei (Annex 9).&#13;
Disbursements for equipment, machinery, vehicles, goods, materials and commodities,&#13;
excluding recurrent costs for locally procured commodities and fertilizers which would not&#13;
be financed under the project, would be made against 100 percent of the foreign&#13;
expenditures for these items, 100 percent of the ex-factory price for locally manufactured&#13;
items, and 75 percent of expenditures for such items procured locally. Disbursements for&#13;
technical assistance, consulting services, studies, research, and training, including study&#13;
tours and work-study, would be made against 100 percent of expenditures.  No&#13;
disbursements would be made against duties and taxes.&#13;
3.48         For expenditures on works under contracts valued at less than $2.0 million&#13;
and goods under contracts valued at less than $300,000, and on services, studies and&#13;
research under contracts valued at less than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for&#13;
individuals, and on all training, reimbursement would be made on the basis of Statements&#13;
of Expenditure (SOEs). Documentation and progress reports giving physical amounts and&#13;
unit prices to support SOEs would be prepared and retained by the PMOs and provided to&#13;
Bank supervision missions.&#13;
3.49         To facilitate disbursements, Special Accounts in US dollars would be&#13;
established in a bank acceptable to the Bank/IDA by: (a) Hubei for $6.0 million; and (b)&#13;
Hunan for $9.0 million. Applications for replenishment would be submitted monthly or&#13;
when amounts withdrawn equal 50 percent of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs&#13;
sooner. Special Accounts would be managed by the Finance Bureaus of Hubei and Hunan,&#13;
and supervised by the Ministry of Finance. Retroactive financing totalling $21.0 million&#13;
equivalent (SDR 5.44 for Hubei and SDR 8.83 for Hunan) would be provided to cover&#13;
expenditures incurred after August 18, 1994 and before signing of the loan/credit&#13;
agreements. This would accelerate mobilization of contractors for Jiangya Dam, ongoing&#13;
and new construction, early procurement of equipment and materials, and technical&#13;
assistance.  Annex 9 shows the estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed&#13;
loan/credit.  The projected disbursement schedule is consistent with the general&#13;
disbursement profile for irrigation projects in China.&#13;
N. ACCOUNTS AND AuDITs&#13;
3.50         For the Hubei and Hunan Components, county level line agency or WSC&#13;
PMOs would maintain accounts and records of all project expenditures, which would be&#13;
separate from the normal budget accounts. These accounts and records would be&#13;
forwarded to prefectural/municipality and provincial PMOs in the line agencies where the&#13;
data would be assembled into separate accounts for each subproject and consolidated into&#13;
overall accounts for the concerned line agency. At the provincial level, in Hubei, the line&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
agency PMOs would submit their accounts to the FMO of the project, which would be&#13;
responsible to consolidate all the accounts for the Hubei Component. In Hunan, the LHPC&#13;
PMO for Jiangya Dam and the Tieshan and Liuduzhai PMOs would maintain separate&#13;
accounts and submit them to the HPD PMO, which would prepare consolidated accounts.&#13;
Agreements were reached at negotiations that Hubei and Hunan would maintain separate&#13;
accounts for the project, and furnish to the Bank/IDA within six months after the end of&#13;
each fiscal year audit reports prepared by an independent auditor satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/IlDA on project accounts, SOEs, and Special Accounts for their respective components&#13;
of the project. For SOEs, the audit report would contain a separate opinion by the auditor&#13;
on whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and&#13;
internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the&#13;
corresponding withdrawals. The State Audit Administration or an independent, qualified&#13;
audit agency would be acceptable to carry out project audits.&#13;

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1          The Provincial Governments of Hubei and Hunan would implement the&#13;
subprojects under the project. Provincial line agencies and their lower level offices would&#13;
implement the specific irrigation and drainage subprojects, and the nonwater subprojects&#13;
in Hubei, in the field; and LHPC would implement the Jiangya Dam in Hunan. Project&#13;
Leading Groups (PLGs) and Project Management Offices (PMOs) have been established&#13;
in Hubei and Hunan and in LHPC to coordinate implementation. In both Hubei and&#13;
Hunan, the Provincial-level PMOs would be located in the line agencies, and&#13;
organizational arrangements for implementation are designed to carry out implementation&#13;
through line agencies similar to normal Government-financed projects. The concerned&#13;
departments of MWR would provide overall sectoral management support for the project,&#13;
including policy guidance, overall planning, technical assistance, and extension (transfer&#13;
of experience). Institutional development under the project would also strengthen operation&#13;
and management after completion. Agreements were reached at negotiations that: (a)&#13;
Hubei and Hunan would maintain their PLGs and line agency PMOs at the provincial&#13;
level, and PLGs at the prefectural and county levels, with staff composition, responsibilities&#13;
and functions acceptable to the Bank/lIDA; and (b) LHPC would maintain its PMO with&#13;
competent staff in adequate numbers with responsibilities and functions satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/IDA.&#13;
Hubei Component&#13;
4.2          Provincial Project Leading Group. At the provincial level, the PLG has&#13;
been established and would have overall responsibility for implementation of the project,&#13;
project coordination, and policy level guidance (Chart 2). PLG would be chaired by the&#13;
Vice Governor for Agriculture and include leaders from the Government of Hubei and its&#13;
General Office, Provincial Planning Commission (PPC), Water Resources Department&#13;
(WRD), Finance Bureau (FB), Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Department (AAHD),&#13;
Forestry Department (FD), Aquatic Bureau (AB), Audit Bureau, Environmental Protection&#13;
Bureau, and the Agricultural Bank of China. Under PLG, a Project Leading Group Office&#13;
(PLGO) would be established to handle the day-to-day business of the project. PLGO&#13;
would comprise a Director from PPC, an Executive Vice-Director from WRD, a&#13;
Vice-Director from FB, and a Vice-Director from PPC. PLGO would link the line&#13;
agencies with PLG, be directed by the Leading Group (not an agency), operate mainly&#13;
through the line agencies to support (not manage) implementation, have no staff of its own,&#13;
and function as a group. Line agencies (e.g., WRD) would have full responsibility and&#13;
authority for project implementation. The PLGO Executive Vice-Director from WRD&#13;
would be responsible for routine work of the PLGO and emphasizing implementation of&#13;
water conservancy subprojects. The Vice-Director from FB would be mainly responsible&#13;
to oversee funds in possession of the project, financial management of the project, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
project expenditures and their submission to the Bank for reimbursement.  The&#13;
Vice-Director from PPC would be responsible for planning, comprehensive coordination,&#13;
and unified external affairs. At negotiations, agreement was reached that Hubei would&#13;
maintain the PLGO with duties, fisnctions and staffing satisfactory to the Bank/IDA.&#13;
4.3          Provincial Project Management Offices. Under the Hubei PLGO would&#13;
be the Comprehensive Project Management Office (CPMO) under the PPC, the Financial&#13;
Management Office (FMO) under the FB, and the Project Management Offices (PMOs)&#13;
for water conservancy, agriculture (for soil improvement), forestry, animal husbandry (for&#13;
grassland development), and aquaculture under their respective line agencies. All PMOs&#13;
would answer directly to PLG and carry out decisions made by PLG. CPMO would be&#13;
responsible for monitoring, verification and evaluation of the project; coordinating relations&#13;
among the concerned line agencies; reporting on important project issues to PLG and&#13;
providing advice to PLG for decision making; undertaking overall annual planning for the&#13;
project; organizing and assisting ICB procurement as appropriate, with the concerned line&#13;
agencies; coordinating and managing project monitoring and training and technical&#13;
assistance; providing linkages to relevant national departments; preparing consolidated&#13;
progress and completion reports; and auditing and evaluating the project. FMO would be&#13;
responsible for overall financial management of the project; handling and supervising flow&#13;
of funds to relevant counties, municipalities, prefectures and WSCs; managing the Bank&#13;
loan and its flow and repayment; designing methods of finance and accounting verification;&#13;
opening and managing foreign currency and yuan capital accounts with banks; handling&#13;
accounts for the Bank loan; examining and verifying the financing plan and preparing&#13;
periodic financial reports; coordinating with the CPMO and PMOs in procurement of&#13;
project materials, equipment, consultancy services and research; and providing&#13;
examination, supervision and other financial services for the project. CPMO and FMO&#13;
would ensure adequate and timely counterpart funding at various levels for all subprojects.&#13;
4.4          Provincial line agency PMOs would be responsible for implementation&#13;
through line agency PMO offices at the prefecture, county and project/field levels, and for&#13;
SIDDs through the WSCs. Their responsibilities would include review of annual work&#13;
plans prepared by lower level PMOs; consolidation of annual plans and reporting them to&#13;
CPMO and FMO for review; review of design, construction and specifications for&#13;
materials and equipment; supervision and monitoring of construction, financial progress&#13;
and quality control; assistance to the CPMO with procurement of materials and equipment&#13;

commissioning and acceptance checks for project works upon completion.&#13;
Hunan Component&#13;
4.5          Provincial Project Leading Group. At the provincial level, the Hunan&#13;
PLG has been established and would have overall responsibility for project implementation&#13;
on behalf of the province and for coordination and policy-level guidance (Chart 3). PLG&#13;
is chaired by the Vice Governor for Agriculture and includes leaders from the Government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
of Hunan and its General Office, the Provincial Planning Commission (PPC), Hydro and&#13;
Power Department (HPD), FB, AAHD, Audit Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau,&#13;
and the Agricultural Bank of China. PLG would be responsible to coordinate among the&#13;
concerned departments, especially for financial matters, develop relevant policies and&#13;
regulations, and report regularly to the Provincial government on the project.&#13;
Prefectural/Municipal PMOs at Yueyang for Tieshan and at Shauyang for Liuduzhai would&#13;
also be established to provide local high-level guidance, coordination and support, and to&#13;
report regularly to the Provincial government.&#13;
4.6          Project Management Ofirces. The Provincial PMO has been established&#13;
in HPD. The director of the Provincial PMO would be the Director of HPD or his&#13;
representative. The PMO would comprise five groups: comprehensive, engineering,&#13;
finance, procurement, and environmental protection and resettlement. Representative(s)&#13;
of the PPC and FB would be assigned to relevant sections of the PMO. Under the&#13;
Provincial PMO, the Tieshan PMO and Liuduzhai PMO would be established in their&#13;
respective WSC headquarters, comprising units similar to the Provincial PMO. Below the&#13;
subproject PMOs would be the prefecture, municipal, and county PMOs and WSC Project&#13;
Offices. The PMO in LHPC (World Bank Loan Project Office) has been established and&#13;
would be responsible for Jiangya implementation and LHPC institutional development&#13;
under the project. The Director of the LHPC PMO is a Deputy General Manager of&#13;
LHPC. LHPC has also established the Construction Headquarters at the Jiangya site.&#13;
4.7          Lishui Hydro and Power Corporation. LHPC was registered in March&#13;
1993 (Chart 4). Under its charter, LHPC would manage the Lishui River Basin, carry out&#13;
the development plan for the basin, and in particular construct, operate and manage the&#13;
Jiangya Dam under the proposed project. The Corporation is owned jointly by the&#13;
Province and MWR, each with 50% shares. The LHPC Board of Directors is comprised&#13;
of seven members with at least three from MWR and two from the Province. The&#13;
Chairman of the Board is from MWR/YWRC, and the Vice-Chairman is from the&#13;
Province. At present, the Chairman of the LHPC Board is also the Chairman of the&#13;
YWRC Board; and the Vice-Chairman of the LHPC Board is also the Director of HPD.&#13;
LHPC has departments for River Valley Development, Engineering, Finance and Materials&#13;
Supply, Logistics, Environment and Resettlement, and General Administration, and also&#13;
the World Bank Loan Project PMO for managing LHPC activities under the project.&#13;
LHPC corporate plans include arrangements for transition from an engineering company&#13;
to a river basin authority, basin data collection and handling, operation and management&#13;
of hydraulic resources and infrastructure, basin planning and development, environmental&#13;
management, and enforcement of regulations.&#13;
4.8          To help supervise implementation of Jiangya Dam, LHPC would employ&#13;
a qualified international engineering firm to provide technical assistance during&#13;
implementation of Jiangya Dam; employ a qualified Chinese engineering firm to fulfill the&#13;
functions of the 'Project Engineer'; employ and supervise the international and local&#13;
contractors and consultants for construction of the dam, powerhouse and other facilities;&#13;
carry out periodic dam safety reviews through DSRP; contract and coordinate with the&#13;
concerned Environmental Protection Bureaus and other agencies to carry out the EMMP;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
contract with Resettlement Bureaus to implement resettlement and with Wuhan University&#13;
of Hydro and Electrical Engineering to supervise and monitor resettlement; arrange and&#13;
manage financing of the above activities; and undertake institutional development activities&#13;
to strengthen internal management systems for construction and finance of Jiangya and for&#13;
river basin management. During the project period, LHPC would maintain and operate&#13;
a Panel of Experts (POE) for Jiangya, which would include DSRP and the Environment&#13;
and Resettlement Panel which have been established.&#13;
Ministry of Water Resources&#13;
4.9          The project covers two large provinces, and Jiangya Dam in which MWR&#13;
has a direct financial interest as joint owner with Hunan. MWR's role would be to provide&#13;
for: (a) overall sectoral management, regulation and policy guidance; (b) dissemination of&#13;
lessons learned from the project, and especially to extend SIDD concepts to other&#13;
provinces through, for example, pilot projects, specialized technical assistance, study tours,&#13;
and training; and (c) specialized technical assistance (e.g., on SIDDs). Such support&#13;
related to the project would be arranged through the Department of International&#13;
Cooperation and Foreign Investment Management Office (FIMO) of MWR.&#13;
Self-financing Irrigation and Drainage Districts&#13;
4.10         In both Hubei and Hunan, SIDDs would be established at irrigation and&#13;
drainage subprojects covered under the project by: (a) conversion of the existing&#13;
Management Authority to a WSC, which would gradually take over the duties of the&#13;
Authority and lower level (e.g., county) WRBs for the subproject, including the unified&#13;
operation of the canal network and medium and large size reservoirs connected to the&#13;
system; and (b) formation of WUAs at the lower levels of the system, which would take&#13;
over the duties of the local WMSs and be comprised of the existing village-level water&#13;
management groups. Both entities would be responsible for implementing their respective&#13;
works under the project, and both would be established at each subproject starting with the&#13;
Zhanghe and Tieshan pilot projects.&#13;
4.11         WSCs would be established and registered under the Companies Law of&#13;
1994, autonomous, financially independent (as much as possible), responsible for&#13;
management of the entire canal system down to the WUA level, and responsible to provide&#13;
support, technical supervision and monitoring of the WUAs. The main differences&#13;
between the existing Management Authorities and WSCs would be that WSCs would: (a)&#13;
have unified authority and responsibility for the entire water supply system from the point&#13;
of diversion to point of sale to WUAs, for both construction and operation; (b) be financial&#13;
entities intended to operate at a profit (or at least break even) in their water operations; and&#13;
(c) be free of many government agency constraints and practices. To help protect WSC&#13;
financial viability and farmer incentives to participate, current govemment support&#13;
(including financial support) would be maintained for SIDDs/WSCs and phased out&#13;
gradually after the project. The Articles of Association for each WSC would be based on&#13;
agreed model Articles of Association as adapted to local conditions, and would specify the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
objectives of the WSC and how it would be set up, organized and operated. The WSC&#13;
Board of Directors would comprise representatives of shareholders, including farmer&#13;
beneficiaries. WSCs would be designed to function as business utilities, selling water to&#13;
clients (e.g., WUAs or cities), producing and selling electricity, and providing other&#13;
services on a fee basis such as drainage and flood protection. Separate financial accounts&#13;
would be kept for all such operations. County and other local govemments would help&#13;
WSCs mobilize the customary labor of farmers in the subproject area for construction work&#13;
on their subproject; this would help promote 'ownership" of the subproject by the farmers.&#13;
Part of this labor obligation would be permanently assigned to the WSC and WUAs for&#13;
maintenance and repair work, in exchange for the farmers' accepting greater obligations&#13;
for WUAs and WSCs. Allocation of voting rights on WSC Boards would be related to&#13;
contributions (in cash, labor or kind) to construction under the project. Agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations that Hubei and Hunan would assign or cause to be assigned by&#13;
June 30, 1996 to each WSC and WUA to be established under the project the rights of the&#13;
county and local governments to the farmers' customary labor, for irrigation and drainage&#13;
responsibilities assumed by the WSCs and WUAs.&#13;
4.12         WUAs would be based on hydraulic units (e.g., the service area of a&#13;
lateral) and formed by the farmers at the village and township level. WUA membership&#13;
would be comprised of the farmer irrigators in the service area of the concerned WUA.&#13;
WUA members would select their own local leaders, and also an Executive Committee&#13;
which would be responsible for day-to-day management of the WUA, oversight of water&#13;
operations, collection of water fees from members, payment of water charges to the WSC&#13;
for water delivered, mobilization of labor for construction and O&amp;M, etc. Each WUA&#13;
would sign a Letter of Agreement and register with their respective WSC; and each would&#13;
have By-Laws based on model By-Laws agreed for the project which would specify&#13;
organizational arrangements, membership requirements, rights and responsibilities of&#13;
members, responsibility for cost contributions and cost recovery, etc. WSCs would&#13;
promote WUA development, provide technical assistance to WUAs, monitor WUA&#13;
operation, and ensure that WUAs meet agreed standards of maintenance and performance.&#13;
Environment and Resettlement&#13;
4.13         Environment.  LHPC, through its Environment and Resettlement&#13;
Department (ERD), would be responsible for implementation of the EMMP for Jiangya&#13;
Dam under the project. Its role would be primarily administration, coordination and&#13;
management, including monitoring and reviewing progress, consulting with authorities,&#13;
arranging for services, providing payments, monitoring operations, negotiating agreements&#13;
and coordinating with responsible technical agencies such as the Bureau of Environmental&#13;
Protection and Departments of Forestry, Agriculture, Water Resources, and/or Public&#13;
Health at the township, county and provincial levels. After completion of Jiangya, LHPC&#13;
would continue to monitor water quality and land use changes as part of its overall&#13;
responsibility for environment in the Lishui Basin. The various civil works contractors&#13;
may, in their contracts, be made responsible for selected EMMP tasks during construction,&#13;
such as for control of air pollution, soil erosion or treatment of sewage from construction&#13;
camps. For Sihu, the Research Institute for Water Resource Protection for the Yangtze,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
working with the PMO in the Hubei WRD, would be responsible for implementation of&#13;
the EMMP and overall environmental management during construction. The Institute&#13;
would coordinate with the Sihu Management Authority, county and prefectural&#13;
Environmental Protection Bureaus, the relevant monitoring stations, and other concerned&#13;
prefecture and county agencies. The Institute would also manage implementation of the&#13;
water quality study in association with the Hubei Environmental Monitoring Center.&#13;
4.14         Resettlement. LHPC through ERD would arrange, fund, supervise, and&#13;
monitor resettlement for Jiangya Dam under the project. It would contract with the&#13;
appropriate prefectural and County Resettlement Offices for implementation of the RAP,&#13;
and provide the necessary funding; L[PC would disburse funds for resettlement directly&#13;
to concemed County Resettlement Offices. Costs for the resettlement would be financed&#13;
by MWR and Hunan Provincial funds provided through LHPC. Priority would be given&#13;
to: (a) completion of resettlement of 421 people who would be displaced when the&#13;
upstream cofferdam is complete to 138 m in April, 1995; and (b) completion of&#13;
arrangements for resettlement in Hefeng County in Hubei.&#13;
Operation and Management&#13;
4.15         O&amp;M of Irrigation and Drainage Subprojects. Standard O&amp;M practice&#13;
in China is for main canals and facilities to be operated by a project authority. Smaller&#13;
canals are operated by lower level WRBs at the prefecture, municipal, and county levels,&#13;
depending on the size of the canals and facilities, under the administrative control of their&#13;
respective government bodies; e.g., counties. This fragmentation of management authority&#13;
and responsibility makes it difficult to achieve high system efficiencies.&#13;
4.16         Under the project, the WSC for each subproject would be established at the&#13;
system level before or during construction; TRWSC has already been established at&#13;
Tieshan. After completion of the subproject, WSCs would be responsible for O&amp;M of the&#13;
system. At lower levels in the system, WUAs would be responsible for O&amp;M at the&#13;
village level. For each irrigation and drainage subproject, a Plan for O&amp;M (POM) would&#13;
be prepared by the responsible WSC with assistance of the provincial WRB, and would&#13;
incorporate WSC and WUA development and operation. Agreement was reached at&#13;
negotiations that: (a) all dams, reservoirs and irrigation systems rehabilitated or&#13;
constructed under the project would be operated, maintained and inspected periodicalty&#13;
according to sound engineering practices, satisfactory to the Bank/lDA; and (b) draft&#13;
POMs for irrigation subprojects would be submitted to the Bank Group for review by&#13;
December 31, 1996.&#13;
4.17         Management of Jiangya Dam. LHPC would manage Jiangya Dam after&#13;
completion. The highest priority for operation would be on flood control. Some 40&#13;
percent of reservoir capacity between April and September, 740 Mcm, would be reserved&#13;
for flood control operations (Annex 3). Separate revenue and cost accounts would be&#13;
maintained by LHPC for power, flood control, navigation, irrigation, water supply, etc.&#13;
and dam O&amp;M.&#13;
&#13;

Progress and Completion Reports and Supervision&#13;
4.18         Progress monitoring reports would be prepared and submitted to the Bank&#13;
Group by the Hubei CPMO and Hunan PMO by June 30 and December 31 of each year,&#13;
with format and coverage satisfactory to the Bank.  Progress reports would be&#13;
computerized, based on key indicators, and updated before each Bank supervision mission&#13;
(a planned schedule of Bank Group supervision missions is given in Annex 11). Key&#13;
indicators would include earthworks, concrete works, structures, etc. for physical and&#13;
financial progress of canal development, reservoir repair and on-farm works; training,&#13;
study tours, and specialized technical assistance for institutional development progress; and&#13;
the area developed, number of WSCs and WUAs established and the area they cover, and&#13;
households benefited for development impact. Evaluation and completion reports would&#13;
also be prepared by the PMO in Hunan and CPMO in Hubei, and submitted to the&#13;
Bank/IDA within six months of project closing. MWRIFIMO would assist and accompany&#13;
IDA/Bank supervision missions. Before each supervision mission, each component would&#13;
employ outside experts to conduct a Pre-supervision Review of all aspects of the project&#13;
and its progress, covering key indicators and other topics as necessary and as may be&#13;
requested by the Bank/IDA; the results of the Review would be provided to the Bank&#13;
supervision mission for review and discussion during the mission. The mid-term review&#13;
for the project would be organized before December 31, 1997 by the provinces.&#13;
Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower would ensure that Hubei, Hunan&#13;
and LHPC would furnish to the Bank Group by June 30 and December 31 semi-annual&#13;
progress reports, and participate in and carry out before December 31, 1997 the mid-term&#13;
review on project implementation progress, prospects and expected development impact.&#13;

5. PRODUCTION, BENEFITS AND COST RECOVERY&#13;
A. AGRICULTURAL BENEFrrs&#13;
Water Resource Subprojects&#13;
5.1          The proposed irrigation sub-projects would increase agricultural output and&#13;
incomes from about 321,500 ha at relatively low cost, on average about $170/ha for&#13;
rehabilitation covering 271,300 ha in Hubei and about $1,600 for 50,200 ha of new&#13;
irrigation in Hunan (Annex 10). Benefits would mostly result from carrying out essential&#13;
works which have hitherto been deferred due to lack of funds, and from investments in&#13;
improved operations with more user participation to meet the needs of high input/output&#13;
farming systems. It is expected that creation of SIDDs and WUAs under the project would&#13;
lead the way to more general reform of irrigation and drainage system management in the&#13;
two provinces, which have a total of 5.1 million ha of irrigated lands, and provide lessons&#13;
for other provinces. In Sihu, the project would improve flood control conditions for about&#13;
336,500 ha of cultivated lands and improve the productivity of 28,000 ha, and for Sihu and&#13;
Dongting Lake areas would help improve future infrastructure investment and operation&#13;
through development of hydraulic models for design, investment and real time operating&#13;
systems. Tieshan subproject would also supply municipal water to Yueyang City.&#13;
5.2         Incremental agricultural production from irrigation and drainage subprojects&#13;
would come from the intensification of irrigation on existing areas achieved through&#13;
improvement of drainage and irrigation reliability particularly for rice, wheat, rapeseed,&#13;
and cotton production, expansion of irrigated area by reclamation of poorly drained&#13;
lowland in Hubei, and reclamation of upland wastelands in Hunan. There would be no&#13;
change or only minor changes in the crop mix for Zhanghe, Dongfeng, Yindan, and&#13;
Wenxia subprojects, but in Sihu more substantial changes in crop areas (including&#13;
expansion of winter cropping) are expected within the same mix of crops due to better&#13;
drainage. Changes in Hunan generally involve introduction of irrigated cropping systems&#13;
into rainfed and wasteland areas, rather than changes in existing cropping patterns in&#13;
already irrigated areas.&#13;
5.3          The project would result in increased production of a number of irrigated&#13;
crops, of which the most important are rice, wheat, cotton and rapeseed. The bulk of&#13;
incremental output would come from increased yields and to a lesser extent from increases&#13;
in cropping intensities. In Hubei, crop yields would on average increase by about 10-15&#13;
percent through a combination of drainage and water supply improvement and balanced&#13;
fertilizer use; e.g., rice (paddy) yields would rise from about 6.3 t/ha without the project&#13;
to 7.1 t/ha. In Hunan, yields are currently more restricted by poor water availability than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
in Hubei and would increase from a lower base yield. Unirrigated or partly irrigated land&#13;
would be brought under full irrigation, and larger yield increases of about 25 percent-40&#13;
percent are expected; rice yields would rise from about 4.9 t/ha to 6.2 t/ha. In both&#13;
provinces in most areas, full development yields would be obtained in two years after&#13;
completion of improvements, and full area benefits would be attained over four or five&#13;
years, so that full development benefits would accrue at the end of year six or seven, with&#13;
relatively little change in output during initial years. At full development, the output of&#13;
paddy rice would rise about 26 percent above present levels from 1.4 million tons to 1.8&#13;
million tons, wheat by 21 percent from 0.4 million tons to 0.5 million tons, cotton by 236&#13;
percent from 22,000 tons to 74,000 tons, and rapeseed by 39 percent from 62,000 tons to&#13;
86,000 tons. The anticipated increase in production reflects a combination of greater water&#13;
availability and better water control in average years, and an increased ability of the system&#13;
to meet shortfalls in drought years. In Sihu, increases in cropping intensity would play&#13;
a major role as 28,000 ha which are presently single cropped would be double cropped&#13;
after improved drainage is provided.&#13;
Nonwater Resource Subprojects in Hubei&#13;
5.4          Aquaculture. Improvement of 17 lakes (12,593 ha) would increase annual&#13;
fish, turtle, and crab production by about 100 percent from about 6,400 t to 12,800 t. For&#13;
fish production ponds (581 ha), the fish production target would be 7.5 t/ha/yr for both&#13;
new and improved ponds, compared to the average current production of about 4.5 t/halyr&#13;
from existing, unimproved ponds. Carp production from the new production ponds would&#13;
be about 1,600 t/yr from 216 ha; and the incremental production from improved&#13;
productions ponds would be about 1,100 t/yr, rising from 1,640 t/yr to 2,740 t/yr for 365&#13;
ha. The yield from nursery ponds would be about 6 t/ha/yr, representing an average&#13;
incremental increase of about 2.4 t/halyr for improved nursery ponds; fingerlings would&#13;
be used to stock the small lakes, reservoirs and production ponds under the project.&#13;
Production of fish fingerlings would thus increase by about 1,200 t/yr, with about 700 t/yr&#13;
from new nursery ponds (117 ha) and about 500 t/yr from improved nursery ponds (205&#13;
ha). Five new fish hatcheries would produce a total of about 550 million fry (3 cm) each&#13;
year. A pilot 1-ha turtle farm would produce about 9 t/yr of market-sized turtles, and a&#13;
new 4.2-ha turtle hatchery would produce about 11 t/yr of seed turtles (100 g each). At&#13;
full development, total incremental fish production from the project lakes, reservoirs, and&#13;
ponds would be about 9,100 t/yr with an estimated gross incremental revenue of about&#13;
Y 40 million annually.&#13;
5.5          Forestry and Grasslands/Livestock. The project would support more&#13;
intensive use of 36,400 ha of poor and marginal land in Hubei for forestry and&#13;
grassland/livestock development. Some of this land, which belongs to the counties, is not&#13;
used while the rest is used by poor farmers with little regard to conservation and the long&#13;
term capacity of the land. As a result, returns are low and likely to fall in the long term.&#13;
By introducing better, more sustainable utilization of these lands, the project would&#13;
increase incomes, particularly of the rural poor, and improve soil and water conservation.&#13;
Better quality seedlings, balanced fertilizer application, reduced planting densities&#13;
appropriate to the soils involved and improved crop management are expected to lift yields&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
above current yields in Hubei for the economic forest crops proposed. Economic forest&#13;
plantings would commence bearing in years 6 and 7 and ultimately reach yields of 13,000&#13;
kg/ha for peaches/plums/pears, 12,500 kg/ha for citrus, 5,000 kg/ha for chestnut, 750&#13;
kg/ha for tea, 150 kg/ha for eucommia (medicinal plant), and 4,000 kg/ha for lycium&#13;
(Chinese wolfberry); these yield projections are modest compared to the experience of&#13;
adjoining provinces. Timber and protection forest would benefit from wider use of better&#13;
quality seedlings and fertilizer. Timber forestry would produce a total yield of firewood,&#13;
poles and pulp timber of 182 m3/ha after 11 years for poplar and 139 m3/ha after 15 years&#13;
for slash pine. Protection forestry would be limited to a 70 percent extraction and would&#13;
yield 74 m3/ha and 176 m3/ha of pulp and firewood timber after 20 years. Average annual&#13;
wood production would rise by about 269,000 m3 of which 60-70 percent would be&#13;
fuelwood and the rest timber. Fruit output, at full development, would rise by 64,000&#13;
tons. For the subproject counties these represent increases of about 75 percent and 150&#13;
percent, respectively, over present output levels.&#13;
5.6          Grasslands for livestock fattening would be adequately fertilized and&#13;
drained or irrigated as required in the lowlands. Lowland farms would plant 1 ha of&#13;
pasture to produce three fattened steers from 12,000 kg/ha dry matter, while upland farms&#13;
would plant 2 ha to achieve the same result. In the case of livestock, the project would&#13;
result in an annual incremental production of 49,000 cattle at full development. In&#13;
comparison, the present cattle population in the subproject counties is around one million.&#13;
5.7          Soil Improvement. The six fertilizer blending factories under the project&#13;
would produce, at full development, 180,000 tons annually of compound ferdlizer. This&#13;
would be sufficient for about 6 percent of the total area planted to rice and wheat in the&#13;
subproject counties. The use of better balanced fertilizer would help overcome specific&#13;
nutrient deficits thereby increasing crop yields, increase returns to fertilizer input, and also&#13;
reduce the use of chemical ferdlizer (mostly nitrogenous fertilizer) by 67,000 tons. Project&#13;
funded factories would also encourage private sector development of blending units. Better&#13;
balanced fertilizer would achieve yield gains of 10-30 percent in a range of annual grain&#13;
and oilseed crops in the project area when combined with irrigation improvement. As&#13;
project ferdlizer would be supplied mainly to water resource subproject areas, these gains&#13;
have been included with benefits from irrigation and drainage investments.&#13;
Market Prospects and Prices&#13;
5.8          Irrigated Crops. The increase in production resulting from the irrigation&#13;
and drainage subprojects would be small relative to provincial output. For example, the&#13;
incremental production represents about 1.5 percent of the total rice production of both&#13;
provinces (40.9 million tons in 1992), 4 percent of wheat production, 5 percent of cotton&#13;
production and 3 percent of rapeseed production. Marketing of these crops is well&#13;
developed and disposal of surpluses should not present a problem. Some of the project&#13;
areas - Liuduzhai and Yindan - are rice deficit areas and have to 'import' rice from the&#13;
Dongting Lake and Sihu areas. In some areas rice, particularly low quality rice, is used&#13;
for animal feed. This is mostly undertaken by specialized households who have quality&#13;
hybrid pigs and can practice a high level of husbandry. Any low quality surplus rice&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
would be used by these households. In the case of cotton, Sihu is a well-established&#13;
producing area and there are a number of ginning factories.&#13;
5.9          Flsh. Hubei has a well established marketing system for fish. A majority&#13;
of the fish produced within the Province in 1992 were purchased through direct contract&#13;
sales (about 70 percent) to work units and restaurants, and the balance was sold via retail&#13;
markets. Retail fish are commonly sold by individual fishermen/farmers, fish traders,&#13;
and/or the farms at markets in the vicinity of the production area. The annual incremental&#13;
production from the project of about 12,600 t at full development is not large relative to&#13;
current fish supply, and would represent about 12 percent of fish production in Hubei and&#13;
about 21 percent of fish production in the project counties/cities.  Moreover, fish&#13;
production in Hubei increased annually by about 53,500 t between 1990 and 1992, of&#13;
which fish exported to other provinces increased on average each year by 3,225 t or 6&#13;
percent of the incremental production. Fish demand in Hubei appears strong and&#13;
substantial export demand exists, and those trends appear likely to continue due to&#13;
generally higher incomes and demand created by major construction projects.&#13;
5.10         Wood, Fruit and Meat. All project timber output faces attractive markets&#13;
given continuing economic growth in China. The subproject counties are deficient in wood&#13;
and currently about 240,000 n3 is imported from outside the areas. Demand is expected&#13;
to rise in the future and the project output would easily be sold locally. In the case of&#13;
fruit, supplies are likely to rise sharply in the future as new plantations have been&#13;
undertaken in many provinces. However, the disposal of the relatively small amount of&#13;
incremental output from the subproject areas should not pose any problems. Incremental&#13;
fruit (including peach/plum/pear, citrus and chestnut) production would represent only&#13;
about 10 percent of such production in 1992 in Hubei. Minor crops such as Gingko,&#13;
Lycium and Eucommia are marketed to herbal medicine processors in Hong Kong, who&#13;
are short of supplies. With regard to meat, there are likely to be increasing shortages,&#13;
both locally and nationally, due to rapidly rising demand combined with constrained feed&#13;
resources. Livestock prices in Hubei rose from about Y 6/kg liveweight in 1992 to&#13;
Y 8.5/kg in 1994. Demand for meats other than pork and chicken have been rising, so&#13;
output of fattened steers should have a ready market.&#13;
B. JLUNGYA DAM BENEFms&#13;
5.11         The main benefits of the Jiangya subproject come from the control of&#13;
floods, and supply of power and energy to the Hunan power grid (Annex 10). Other&#13;
benefits will also result from improved water supply for irrigation and domestic uses,&#13;
improved river transportation and tourism. Although these latter benefits are important,&#13;
they are small compared to the flood control and power benefits and have been omitted&#13;
from the analysis.&#13;
Flood Control&#13;
5.12         The Li River (Lishui) originates in mountainous country and is joined by&#13;
two main tributaries, the Lou River on which Jiangya would be located and the Xie River,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
before flowing into a low lying lake and plains area called Songli District which is west&#13;
Dongting Lake. The river morphology in the lake area is extremely complicated. The Li&#13;
flows into west Dongting Lake which is connected to the Yangtze River. In the lake area,&#13;
agricultural and populated areas are located in "polder" areas protected by 531 km of&#13;
dikes. Flooding in Songli District is frequent and severe. Even after massive work in&#13;
raising and strengthening dikes, the current flood protection standard is estimated at only&#13;
one in four to seven years, and protection is deteriorating because of sedimentation in the&#13;
Dongting Lake area, which is primarily due to diversion of flood flows from the Yangtze.&#13;
5.13         Protection against floods with 30-year return period can be provided in the&#13;
west Dongting area by construction of three reservoirs on the Lishui Basin including&#13;
Jiangya. Of the three, Jiangya would give the largest incremental gains in flood&#13;
protection; flood routing simulations show that with Jiangya Dam, flooding of polder areas&#13;
could have been avoided for nine of the 11 major floods since 1935. For 20-year floods,&#13;
flooding of polder areas could be eliminated or reduced by about 85 percent (depending&#13;
on flood volume), and for floods with a 50-year return period, flooding of polders could&#13;
be reduced by 40 to 50 percent. However, full security against 50-year floods will only&#13;
be achieved with construction of all three reservoirs on the Li, completion of the Three&#13;
Gorges Project, and raising of dikes and use of flood detention basins, although floods of&#13;
short duration can be reasonably controlled by construction of storages in the Li catchment.&#13;
Three Gorges will have two main benefits in the project area: (a) it will reduce flood&#13;
discharges in the Yangtze which would allow more rapid drainage of Dongting flood&#13;
waters to the Yangtze; and (b) it will avoid diversion of Yangtze flows into the Dongting&#13;
Lake area, except under very exceptional circumstances. This will reduce silting of&#13;
Dongting Lake and maintain its capacity to handle floods from the Li River.&#13;
Power Generation&#13;
5.14         Jiangya Dam would have an installed capacity of 300 MW, and generate&#13;
769 GWh per year on average, of which 640 GWh would be firm (exceeded in 95 percent&#13;
of years). The project would be linked to the main Hunan Power Grid by 105 km of 220&#13;
KV transmission lines; this would be provided for in the power sales agreement (para.&#13;
5.20). The annual financial value of power produced based on constant 1994 prices would&#13;
total some Y 384 million ($44 million). Hunan can well use this additional power.&#13;
Energy resources in Hunan Province are comparatively poor, with only hydropower&#13;
resources being relatively abundant, and coal has to be imported. Installed capacity in the&#13;
Hunan power system is about 50 percent hydropower. About 30 percent of hydropower&#13;
potential has been developed, and projects under construction would raise this to nearly 50&#13;
percent. To meet current electricity demand, the province must import power, with heavy&#13;
and light industry (including agro-processing) accounting for 76 percent, residential usage&#13;
for 18 percent, and agriculture only 3 percent. During the 1980's, the growth rate of&#13;
power generation capacity and energy generation was slow, resulting in a serious shortage&#13;
of electricity supply in the province. However, during 1991 and 1992, energy generation&#13;
grew by more than 20 percent.&#13;

- 48 -&#13;
C. Cosr RECovERY&#13;
Irrigation and Drainage Subprojects&#13;
5.15         Policy. State policy for irrigation water supply is that it should be a&#13;
financially independent and self-sustaining activity. All beneficiaries of water resource&#13;
projects, including flood protection services, should pay service fees based on the 'user&#13;
pays" principle. Fees should cover all O&amp;M costs, including provision for depreciation&#13;
and major repairs. Payment may be either in cash or paddy. Fees calculated by the&#13;
relevant irrigation management unit, usually the Irrigation/Drainage Authority or County&#13;
WRB, should follow Provincial guidelines, and should differentiate between the various&#13;
users, such as farmers and local municipalities. The official tariff standard for water is&#13;
volumetric pricing.&#13;
5.16         Cost Recovery in Practice.  Project Irrigation/Drainage Authorities&#13;
currently obtain revenues from water charges levied on farmers, sales of untreated M&amp;I&#13;
water, and from sales of power to the local grid, in addition to revenue from non-water&#13;
activities. Due to lack of suitable measurement systems, farmers benefiting from irrigation&#13;
or drainage schemes are normally charged on the basis of area cultivated rather than on&#13;
volume of water delivered, although the legal formula for calculating water charges&#13;
includes both fixed (area/crop) and variable (volumetric) components, based on rice prices.&#13;
The actual rates charged vary from scheme to scheme and are largely decided on the basis&#13;
of what is considered a tolerable charge rather than actual O&amp;M costs. The charges are&#13;
collected from farmers by the leaders of the Village Water Management Groups and passed&#13;
to the Township and County FBs; collection rates are high with few defaults. Funds&#13;
collected are then passed on to government agencies responsible for O&amp;M, with part being&#13;
diverted into general budgetary resources at county or township level. In general, only&#13;
about 45-50 percent of all charges is actually available for actual O&amp;M of the system; of&#13;
the remainder, about 20 percent of the charges is abstracted directly by the Township and&#13;
County FBs, and 25-30 percent goes to the Project Management Authority. Water charges&#13;
are perceived by farmers as a tax similar to other taxes and levies collected by the&#13;
township and county governments, rather than payment for a service. In addition to&#13;
charges levied, each farm-household is also required to provide 15-20 days annually of&#13;
customary, unpaid (corvee) labor for the maintenance or construction of agency-managed&#13;
infrastructure.  The customary labor is controlled, mobilized and used by local&#13;
governments.&#13;
5.17         Water charge rates are relatively low. In Hunan and Hubei charges range&#13;
around Y 6/mu ($10/ha). However, if the value of the corvee labor required from farmers&#13;
for system maintenance is also taken into account, the amount paid is about Y 30 per mu&#13;
($50/ha), which is not low. For comparison, agricultural incomes in the various subproject&#13;
areas are Y 200-300/mu ($340- 510/ha). Analysis of charges and costs of O&amp;M shows&#13;
that although the total amount paid by farmers (cash plus labor) is generally adequate for&#13;
routine O&amp;M, provided it is efficiently used, it is not usually sufficient to cover periodic&#13;
repairs and overhaul and certainly not rehabilitation or capital costs. Moreover, the cash&#13;
clement does not cover salaries plus costs of inputs, such as machinery services or cement,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
which have to be purchased. In the case of M&amp;I water, charges are set on the basis of&#13;
quantity supplied and rates are about 5-10 times the rate set for irrigation water. Funds&#13;
are directly collected by the Project Management Authority, as are revenues from sale of&#13;
electricity.&#13;
5.18         Cost Recovery Under the Project.  Adequate arrangements for cost&#13;
recovery are essential for the success of SIDDs and the financial viability of WSCs and&#13;
WUAs, and one of the critical requirements will be to convert the water charge system&#13;
from a 'tax" to a "service fee" basis. Under the project, cost recovery from farmers for&#13;
irrigation and drainage subprojects would be partly through direct labor contribution for&#13;
construction, maintenance and repairs, and partly through water service fees. The farmers'&#13;
direct contribution of labor during construction, totalling as much as 15-30 percent or&#13;
more of capital costs, would count against their required corvee labor, part or all of which&#13;
would be transferred to the WSCs and WUAs for use in construction and O&amp;M of their&#13;
subprojects (see para. 4.11) and considered as (part of) the farmers' contribution to cost&#13;
recovery. Financially sustainable water charge rates for O&amp;M would be somewhat higher&#13;
than current levels in total, and the cash portion of the charges would likely be&#13;
substantially higher than at present.  Analysis of incremental income from project&#13;
investments indicates that the farmers' ability to pay is adequate (see Annex 6).&#13;
5.19         Water charges (service fees) would be collected by WUAs from their&#13;
members; part would be used to purchase water from the WSC, and part would be retained&#13;
for intemal WUA operations. Fees paid by WUAs to WSCs for water deliveries would&#13;
be expected to cover at least full O&amp;M costs of the WSC (allowing for the value of&#13;
customary labor) and part or all of the repayment cost of the subloan for the World Bank&#13;
loan. To determine suitable water fee rates, Hubei and Hunan would undertake a study&#13;
of financial requirements for SIDDs, to make WSCs and WUAs as self-financing as&#13;
possible. The study would include: analysis of costs of O&amp;M and extraordinary repairs;&#13;
capital cost recovery: options to reduce costs of O&amp;M; alternative financing terms for&#13;
capital costs; breakdown of costs between WSCs and WUAs; farmers ability and&#13;
willingness to pay; arrangements for assignment of farmers' customary labor from local&#13;
government to WSCs/WUAs; the current level of budget support provided by the&#13;
government for irrigation and drainage districts (including each subproject area in Hubei);&#13;
possible budget support/subsidies required in the future (including those needed to&#13;
compensate for low grain prices); changes needed in water charge regulations and policies&#13;
(including changes needed to enable WUAs to collect water charges); and&#13;
recommendations. Policy and budget (financial) support should be continued at current&#13;
levels in the near term, to avoid discrimination against farmer's who participate in the&#13;
SIDDs compared to farmers outside the project areas and to maintain incentives to&#13;
participate; they would be phased out gradually. Agreement was reached at negotiations&#13;
that Hubei and Hunan would: (a) complete SIDD cost recovery studies by March 31, 1996&#13;
for O&amp;M of WSCs and WUAs, in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/lIDA; (b) by June 30, 1996 set water charge rates under WSCs and WUAs established&#13;
under the project, sufficient for each to cover at least its full O&amp;M costs and all debt&#13;
repayment and servicing obligations, and authorize WSCs and WUAs to collect water&#13;
charges; and (c) provide to each WSC through the year 2001 budget support equal to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
support provided to existing governmental entities with equivalent functions and&#13;
responsibilities to those asswned by WSC and WUAs.&#13;
JianUa Dam&#13;
5.20        Jiangya Dam Power. Under the project, LHPC would sell Jiangya power&#13;
to the Hunan Grid. The power tariff would be a two-part charge (capacity and variable),&#13;
and would be sufficient to ensure debt-service coverage of about 1.6. Agreements were&#13;
reached at negotiations that by June 30, 1998: (a) the Borrower would enable LHPC to&#13;
charge, collect and adjust power tariffs sufficient to provide by December 31, 2000, and&#13;
thereafter maintain, a debt-service coverage of at least 1.5; and (b) Hunan would ensure&#13;
that the Hunan Power Grid and LHPC enter into a power sales agreement satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank/IDA which establishes a tariff struture sufficient to permit LHPC to maintain a&#13;
debt-service coverage of at least 1.5 by December 31, 2000 and thereafter.&#13;
5.21         Jiangya Dam Flood Control. Primary areas benefiting from Jiangya flood&#13;
control have been identified. Governments in these areas would pay annual flood control&#13;
service fees which should be sufficient to cover full O&amp;M and part of Jiangya Dam costs&#13;
allocated to flood control. These fees would be paid into the Hunan Provincial Flood&#13;
Protection Fund (established in January 1995), which would make corresponding annual&#13;
payments to LHPC. Agreement was reached at negotiations that: (a) Hunan would take&#13;
all steps necessary to ensure that prefectures, counties, municipalities and towns benefiting&#13;
from the flood protection provided by Jiangya Dam pay flood protection fees to the Hunan&#13;
Provincial Flood Protection Fund, which would make payments to LHPC established in&#13;
accordance with a mechanism and procedure satisfactory to the Bank/IDA; and (b) LHPC&#13;
would establish a structure and mechanism satisfactory to the BanI/IDA, no later than&#13;
September 30, 1995, for determining the appropriate amount of the flood protecton fees&#13;
to be paid to it from the Hunan Provincial Flood Protecton Fund.&#13;
D. ENVIONMENT AN HEALTH&#13;
5.22         The project is classified as an 'A' project by the Bank largely because of&#13;
the inclusion of the Jiangya Dam and the related resettlement of people living in the area.&#13;
Environmental impacts of Jiangya would be monitored and controlled through the Jiangya&#13;
EMMP. The irrigation and drainage subprojects would not have any major adverse&#13;
environmental effects. Although there may be an increase in fertilizer and pesticide use&#13;
as a result of more intensive irrigated production, this would be offset to some extent by&#13;
the soil improvement program which would reduce the use of nitrogenous chemical&#13;
fertilizers in the farming system due to better balance between nutrients. The non-water&#13;
subprojects, particularly forestry and grasslands, would have a significant beneficial impact&#13;
on soil erosion and conservation. Jiangya Dam would provide general improvements in&#13;
protection of human lives from floods, and the project is also expected to have specific&#13;
positive health impacts, especially in the Sihu area. Better drainage and water control&#13;
would reduce malaria breeding areas, and construction methods proposed in the EIA and&#13;
EMMP would help control schistosomiasis by using dredge spoil to fill low-lying areas&#13;
where snails breed. In addition, the EMMP for Sihu would promote better long-run&#13;
environmental management in the area.&#13;

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
6.1          The Hubei Component would generate incremental agricultural production&#13;
valued at some Y 767 million/yr at full development, creating annually about 12 million&#13;
days/yr (nearly 50,000 new jobs) of permanent, productive employment for unskilled labor&#13;
and 1.4 million days/yr (about 5,000 new jobs) for skilled labor. At full development, the&#13;
Hunan Component would generate incremental agricultural production valued at about&#13;
Y 192 million/yr and employment totalling about 4.9 million days/yr (about 16,000 new&#13;
jobs); electricity production of some 769 GWh/yr valued at Y 384 million/yr; estimated&#13;
average flood control benefits of Y 185 milhion/yr; and unquantified personal safety,&#13;
navigation, tourism and other benefits. The project would reduce poverty by raising both&#13;
farmer income and employment opportunities, and improve health in the Sihu and&#13;
Dongting Lake areas by reducing the potential for malaria and schistosomiasis. By&#13;
introducing both increased farmer participation and self-financing of irrigation, the project&#13;
will also promote sustainable irrigation development and growth.&#13;
Economic and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
6.2          Summary. The estimated economic rate of return (ERR) is 23 percent&#13;
overall, 26 percent for the Hubei Component, 18 percent for the Hunan Component. The&#13;
economic analysis has been carried out for each subproject separately, and all have&#13;
acceptable ERRs. Sensitivity analysis using switching values (evaluated at 12 percent)&#13;
indicates that the project could tolerate a 30 percent reduction in benefits and 40 percent&#13;
increase in costs and still remain viable. Details are given in Annex 10 and summarized&#13;
in Table 6.1.&#13;
Assumptions for Economic Analysis&#13;
6.3          The economic analysis includes physical contingencies but excludes all&#13;
costs for technical assistance, overhead and price contingencies. The period of analysis&#13;
used is 20 years. Economic prices for inputs and outputs were calculated using IBRD&#13;
project prices and standard conversion factors. For traded commodities, the economic&#13;
prices used in the analysis were based on parity prices, which are higher than presently&#13;
prevailing market prices. With the 1994 devaluation, the official exchange rate is close&#13;
to the rates prevailing in the "swap market." No correction was therefore made to&#13;
exchange rates and a Standard Conversion Factor of unity was used. A shadow rate of&#13;
0.97 was used for unskilled labor. See Annex 10 for details.&#13;

Lb Percentage reduction in benefits to reduce ERR to 12%.&#13;
Le Percentage increase in costs to reduce ERR to 12%.&#13;
6.4          Water Resource Subprojects. All irrigation and drainage subprojects are&#13;
economically viable, but ERRs for irrigation subprojects in Hubei are substantially higher&#13;
than those for irrigation and drainage subprojects in Hunan. This is because the Hubei&#13;
irrigation systems only need investments to address critical bottlenecks, and a relatively&#13;
small investment would result in significant increases in output. In Hunan, completely new&#13;
systems must be built.&#13;
6.5          Nonwater Resource Subprojects. The economic analysis shows that&#13;
aquaculture is highly viable, with an ERR of 35 percent. Timber and fruit plantation is&#13;
economically viable, and the ERR for the forestry component as a whole is 26 percent.&#13;
However, protection plantation (which mostly produces fuelwood) cannot be justified on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
the basis of marketable output alone, and its inclusion in the project is on the basis of its&#13;
soil and water conservation impact. Timber is presently imported, and parity prices used&#13;
in the analysis are about 17 percent above financial prices. For fuelwood, the market price&#13;
is taken to represent the economic value; for fruit, a conversion factor of 0.97 was used.&#13;
The use of economic prices raises operating costs as a large proportion of this is made up&#13;
of ferdlizers, the parity prices of which are also substantially higher than local prices. For&#13;
grassland, the ERR is 22 percent, based on parity prices and assuming only cattle&#13;
breeding. China is likely to experience a growing deficit in meat and may have to resort&#13;
to imports. Prices for cattle are live weight, and financial prices are assumed to&#13;
approximate the economic price. The ERR for the soil improvement subproject has not&#13;
been estimated separately, as the benefit of improved fertilizer use is reflected in higher&#13;
crop yields in irrigation subprojects. However, the new mixing plants would introduce a&#13;
new technology which can substantially increase the productivity of present resources and&#13;
should give high returns compared to existing plants, and provide a demonstration for&#13;
further autonomous development.&#13;
Jiangya Dam Subproject&#13;
6.6          Flood Control. Flood control benefits were calculated as the reduction in&#13;
expected average annual flood damage due to operation of Jiangya Dam. Underlying&#13;
estimates of expected average annual flood damage were made separately for polder areas&#13;
(below Sanjiankou) and river valley areas (above Sanjiankou). Damages include personal&#13;
and public property, and lost agricultural and industrial production. Benefits would accrue&#13;
to the polder areas near Dongting Lake where an estimated 63,667 ha would be protected&#13;
partially or completely, and in the river valley areas where some 13,333 ha would be&#13;
partly or completely protected, according to flood frequencies; an estimated 500,000 people&#13;
would receive some protection.&#13;
6.7          Power Generation. Power benefits from Jiangya were calculated by&#13;
development of least cost expansion plans for the Hunan Power Grid with and without&#13;
Jiangya. The present value of all capital and operating costs, without including the Jiangya&#13;
cost, was then calculated for each expansion scenario. The difference in present values&#13;
provides a measure of alternative cost. If it can be demonstrated that consumers are&#13;
willing to pay at least this alternative cost, it provides a lower bound estimate of the power&#13;
supply benefits of Jiangya. Since power from all new thermal power plants in China is&#13;
priced to achieve loan repayment (assuming fully debt financed) over a ten year period,&#13;
resulting prices to the grid are substantially above long run marginal cost. All incremental&#13;
consumption beyond 1983 levels is charged at this 'new" price so there is ample evidence&#13;
that consumers' willingness to pay is well above long run marginal cost based on thermal&#13;
generation. The "alternative cost" based on thermal generation therefore provides a lower&#13;
bound estimate of power benefits.&#13;
6.8          In developing least cost expansion plans, it was found that it is economical&#13;
to develop available hydropower candidates (other than Jiangya) at the earliest possible&#13;
opportunity. They are therefore common to both scenarios. The replacement for Jiangya&#13;
in the alternative expansion plan is thermal capacity. Thermal candidates included were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
300 MW and 600 MW coal fired plants, 100 MW distilate fired combined cycle plants,&#13;
and 10 MW distilate fired gas turbines. Currently, in China, local manufacturers are&#13;
capable of meeting only 70 percent of the demand for new generating capacity. The&#13;
remainder is imported. Therefore, import parity prices were used for capital costs of&#13;
thermal generation. Coal for future large thermal plants in Hunan is likely to come from&#13;
Shanxi. The shadow price used for coal was based on the export price at Qinhuangdao&#13;
seaport ($35 per ton at 6,000 k cal./kg). Transportation costs between Shanxi mine mouth&#13;
and Qinhuangdao were deducted to obtain a mine-mouth export parity price. Rail transport&#13;
costs between the mine-mouth and Hunan were added to obtain the shadow price in Hunan.&#13;
6.9          Cost Allocation. Common costs of the project (dam, flood handling and&#13;
boatlift facilities) are allocated to power and flood control using the 'separable&#13;
costs/remaining benefits' methodology.  This results in 49 percent of common costs&#13;
allocated to power and 51 percent allocated to flood control.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
6.10         There are few technical and institutional risks. Irrigation and drainage&#13;
subprojects are based on years of successful Chinese and Bank Group experience with&#13;
similar projects, and nonwater subprojects in Hubei are based on proven technologies and&#13;
incorporate lessons from similar Bank projects in their design. Jiangya Dam presents&#13;
several key risks. RCC technology used for Jiangya is relatively new, and Jiangya will&#13;
be among the highest dams of its type in the world when complete. However, China is&#13;
a world leader in the use of RCC technology for such dams, and has successfully used&#13;
RCC technology extensively. The most critical risk is likely to be the supply of cement&#13;
and fly ash, which must be continuous; the ICB contractor would bear this risk.&#13;
Availability and timing of counterpart funding is also a significant risk for Jiangya Dam;&#13;
delays due to lack of funds could be very costly. Financial requirements for Jiangya are&#13;
very large and concentrated in the early years due to rapid implementation, and shortages&#13;
of counterpart funding could substantially slow implementation and delay benefits. The&#13;
financial risk has been addressed by providing a high disbursement percentage for the ICB&#13;
contract for the Jiangya Dam body, to help ensure that the primary investment is completed&#13;
on schedule; and by requiring certification that the People's Construction Bank would&#13;
provide $44 million of local funding for Jiangya as a condition of negotiations (see para.&#13;
3.37). There is also a management risk for Jiangya, given that LHPC is newly formed and&#13;
not yet fully staffed. The project would provide special international TA for Jiangya&#13;
implementation support, as well as direct institutional development support for LHPC, the&#13;
latter for both Jiangya and to promote the future role of LHPC in Lishui River Basin&#13;
management.&#13;
6.11         The other substantial risks are associated with the institutional innovations&#13;
for SIDDs, which would take over responsibility for O&amp;M of irrigation subprojects, and&#13;
the role of LHPC in Lishui River Basin management. Consequently, these innovations&#13;
would be pilot tested, phased in gradually and supported by a comprehensive capacity&#13;
building program. Failure of these institutional innovations will not jeopardize the viability&#13;
or sustainability of the project, as existing management systems could be retained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
6.12         For nonwater subprojects in Hubei, the primary risks for the forestry&#13;
subproject concern selection of beneficiaries, who must manage the investments and repay&#13;
the loan. The risk in grasslands development is that with irrigation the households may&#13;
chose to grow irrigated crops instead of grasslands and livestock. In both cases,&#13;
substantial and continuous consultation by the project with beneficiaries (including women)&#13;
is essential and supported under the project. The soil improvement subproject is a&#13;
relatively simple fertilizer blending operation, but successful results will depend on careful&#13;
management of the production facilities and stocks of raw materials and output. Bad&#13;
management could result in heavy financial losses, and if bad fertlizer is produced, loss&#13;
of farmer confidence and interest in the product. Consequently, the project provides for&#13;
strict operating criteria and close supervision of the enterprises by the line agency PMOs.&#13;

WATER RESOURCES SUBPROJECTS&#13;
A. HUBM  CoMPoNENr&#13;
1.         The main objectives of this subcomponent are to increase agricultural&#13;
production and farmers' income and reduce the risk and impact of floods. Through the&#13;
construction of four irrigation and one drainage subprojects under the Hubei Component;&#13;
improving operation and maintenance and water management; strengthening water&#13;
resources institutions and supporting reforms of water resources laws, regulations and&#13;
organizations; serious constraints that have restricted agricultural development will be&#13;
removed. The following describes irrigation and drainage works and activities to be&#13;
financed under the project.&#13;
2.          Criteria for the selection of subproject areas have been established as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   areas where farmers' standard of living is very low (poor areas);&#13;
(b)   areas with water shortages and frequent droughts;&#13;
(c)   areas with land of good development potential;&#13;
(d)   areas where existing water conservancy facilities are weak;&#13;
(e)   areas prone to waterlogging and flood risks; and&#13;
(f)   areas where local counterpart funds can be raised.&#13;
3.          Based on these criteria, four irrigation subprojects (Dongfeng, Zhanghe,&#13;
Yindan and Wenxia), and one drainage and flood control subproject (Sihu) were selected&#13;
in the hinterland of the Jianghan and the hilly area between the Yangtze River (Chang&#13;
Jiang) and the Han River (Han Jiang). These subprojects are located in Jiangling,&#13;
Qianjiang, Jianli, Honghu, and Zhongxiang counties of Jinzhou Prefecture; Dongbao and&#13;
Shayang counties in Jinmen City; Xiangyang and Laohekou counties in Xiangfan City; and&#13;
Yichang Zhijiang and Dangyang counties in Yichang City.&#13;
Dongfeng Subproject&#13;
4.          Present Situation. The Dongfeng irrigation area is located to the east of&#13;
Yichang City and south of the Jingshan Mountains. The altitude varies from 40 to 240 m&#13;
above sea level and the project area slopes from northwest to southeast. The land in the&#13;

subproject area is high in the northeast and in the southeast with elevations of 240 to 40 m.&#13;
The arable land is 76,050 ha, out of which paddy fields are about 59,000 ha. The key&#13;
irrigation facility in the area is the Shangjiahe Reservoir on the Huangbai River.&#13;
5.          Description of Subproject Works. The project would provide funds to&#13;
construct a concrete cut-off wall with two rows of grout curtains on the body of the&#13;
Shangjiahe Dam. Works aimed at increasing flood discharge capacities and removing&#13;
structural defects would be undertaken on some of the other reservoirs in the area (Baihe,&#13;
Houshankou, Hujiafan, Paoma and Shanxichong). The project would also fund works on&#13;
the main conveyance system to increase its capacity and efficiency. About 87 km of&#13;
general main and branch canals would be lined to reduce seepage and increase conveyance&#13;
capacity.  Various structures would be repaired or replaced, including 4 aqueducts&#13;
(1.3 km), 42 tunnels (12 km) and a number of sluices, culverts, cross-regulators and farm&#13;
bridges. The project would also undertake improvement works on laterals and sublaterals&#13;
serving 2,000 ha where there are local problems. In addition, the project would provide&#13;
some support to the farmers for on-farm works. These works would include widening of&#13;
irrigation and drainage ditches and land leveling.&#13;
6.         In addition, and in order to efficiently manage the new irrigation network,&#13;
the project would provide support for improved operations. Funds would be provided for&#13;
local training and study tours; and a small experimental and training center (840 ni) would&#13;
be provided for technical staff and farmers. Support would also be provided for the&#13;
creation of WUAs.&#13;
Wenxia Subproject&#13;
7.          Present Situation. The Wenxia irrigation area is located in the Jianghan&#13;
plain to the east of the Han River in Zhongxiang County. The subproject area is mainly&#13;
hilly area (60 percent), plain 27 percent and mountains 13 percent. The arable area is&#13;
about 46,500 ha, out of which paddy fields are about 32,000 ha. The principal irrigation&#13;
facility in the area is the Wenxia Reservoir on the Aoshui River, constructed in 1972, with&#13;
an effective storage capacity of 269 million e3, an annual inflow of 194 million in3 and&#13;
a direct command area of 26,500 ha. Another 20,000 ha is irrigated by water from the&#13;
local reservoirs and ponds (capacity 66 million m3), and by pumping water from the Han&#13;
and other local rivers.&#13;
8.          Description of Subproject Works. The project would fund improvements&#13;
on 160 km of main canals, including rebuilding collapsed sections, concrete lining of about&#13;
104 km, slope protection and repairs to 23 tunnels. Similar works would also be carried&#13;
out on 10 branch canals and, in addition, a number of structures such as culverts,&#13;
aqueducts, regulating gates and farrn bridges would be repaired or replaced, and new&#13;
structures installed where required. These interventions would remove critical bottlenecks&#13;
and also increase the conveyance efficiency of the system from 50 to 60 percent. In the&#13;
areas adjoining the Han River, the capacity and reliability of eight pump stations (four for&#13;
irrigation and four for drainage) would be improved. This would improve drainage&#13;
conditions in 5,000 ha and increase the irrigated area from 1,400 ha to about 4,000 ha.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The project would also undertake pilot scale improvement works on laterals and sublaterals&#13;
serving about 2,300 ha where there are local problems, and would provide some support&#13;
to farmers for on-farm works.  The project does not include any provisions for&#13;
improvements on Wenxia Reservoir as this work, already under way, is being funded by&#13;
the Government, but it would provide funds to rehabilitate and strengthen other small- and&#13;
medium-size reservoirs supplying water to the subproject areas. This would include&#13;
strengthening and rehabilitating Huangji and Hongshansi reservoirs and their affiliated&#13;
structures, and connecting Dongqiao reservoir with the other reservoirs.&#13;
9.         In addition, the project would provide the subproject management office with&#13;
computers, some buildings, local training and study tours. Funds would also be provided&#13;
for the creation of WUAs but it is proposed that the use of these funds be reviewed after&#13;
the experience of the pilot areas (Dongfeng and Zhanghe) has been evaluated.&#13;
Yindan Subproject&#13;
10.        Present Situation. The Yindan irrigation area is located in the northern part&#13;
of the Province bordering Henan and extends south from the Danjiangkou Reservoir to the&#13;
confluence of the Han and Tangbaihe Rivers. The land of the subproject is mainly mounds&#13;
(71 percent) and undulating plains with ground elevations of 70 m in the southeast to&#13;
300 m in the northwest. Water for the area is taken from the Danjiangkou Reservoir&#13;
through a tunnel at Qingquangou. Normally this is a gravity flow but sometimes pumping&#13;
is necessary. The total irrigated area is 129,000 ha, of which 92,600 ha would be&#13;
improved under the project.&#13;
11.        Description of Subproject Works. The project would provide funds to&#13;
rehabilitate 55 km of the General Main Canal, including lining of 9.3 kin, construction of&#13;
retaining walls where landslides have occurred, and repair or replacement of a number of&#13;
structures. Works would also be undertaken on main canals 1, 2, 4 and 5. A total of&#13;
132 km of main canals would be rehabilitated, including lining of 4 km, and various&#13;
structures such as sluices, gates, bridges, check structures, siphons and aqueducts would&#13;
be repaired or replaced. The Tengzhuang Reservoir, a medium-size reservoir, would be&#13;
rehabilitated by raising dam height, improving the spillway, protecting slopes and&#13;
constructing two gate chambers on the sluices. The project would also undertake&#13;
improvement works on laterals and sublaterals, and support farmers to undertake on-farm&#13;
works.&#13;
12.        In addition, and in order to improve operations, the project would provide&#13;
funds for local training and study tours. An experimental and training center (1,000 m)&#13;
would be provided for technical staff and farmers. Funds have also been provided for the&#13;
creation of WUAs but it is proposed that the use of these funds be reviewed after the&#13;
experience of the pilot areas has been evaluated.&#13;

- 64-                         ANNEX 1&#13;
Zhanghe Subproject&#13;
13.        Present Situation. The Zhanghe irrigation subproject lies in the hilly areas&#13;
between Jingmen city and Chang Lake. The land is high in the northwest and low in the&#13;
south and the east with elevations from 40 to 110 m. The main water storage facility in&#13;
the area is the Zhanghe Reservoir, which was completed in 1966 and has a storage capacity&#13;
of 2 billion m3. The total irrigated area to be improved under the project is about&#13;
91,000 ha.&#13;
14.        Description of Subproject Works. The project would finance rehabilitation&#13;
on the General Main Canal to restore its conveyance capacity to design level. These works&#13;
would include lining, raising of embankments, and construction of retaining walls or&#13;
culverts in sections where landslides occur frequently. The bulk of project works would&#13;
focus on the No. 3 Main Canal and would comprise rehabilitation of an initial section of&#13;
44 kIn, by lining (20 kIn), construction of retaining walls and culverts, and repair or&#13;
replacement of structures. About 155 km of branch and subbranch canals, associated with&#13;
the No. 3 Main Canal would also be rehabilitated. These works would increase&#13;
conveyance capacity as well as conveyance efficiency (from 50 to 60 percent). Funds&#13;
would also be provided for improving three medium reservoirs in the area by rehabilitating&#13;
embankinents, grouting seepage areas and strengthening of spillways. The project would&#13;
also undertake improvement works on laterals and sublaterals, and support farmers to&#13;
undertake on-farm works.&#13;
15.        In addition, and in order to improve operations, the project would provide&#13;
funds for local traiing and study tours. A small training center (700 m2) would be&#13;
provided for technical staff and farmers and new equipment would be purchased for the&#13;
existing experimental center. Zhanghe, along with Dongfeng, are the two pilot areas&#13;
selected by the Government in Hubei and support would be provided for the creation of&#13;
WUAs from the first year of the project.&#13;
Sihu Subproject&#13;
16.        Present Situation. The Sihu (Four Lakes) area is a low-lying, plain area&#13;
of about 1 million ha, lying in a loop of the Yangtze River between Shashi and Honghu&#13;
cities. The Han River and its tributary, the Dongjing River, form part of its northern and&#13;
eastern boundaries. The area has abundant water resources. Mean annual rainfall is about&#13;
1,200 mm and there is a rich network of lakes and small rivers, most of which connect up&#13;
to the Yangtze or Han Rivers. The area is subject to flooding and waterlogging. There&#13;
is very little local relief and the average slope is 1:15,000. As a result, natural surface&#13;
drainage is sluggish. Construction of infrastructures over the last 40 years has resulted in&#13;
some degree of protection for the 3.9 million people residing within the poldered zone.&#13;
However, risks are still great and rehabilitation, upgrading and improvements in the system&#13;
are needed to provide proper protection to the people, property and crops.&#13;
17.        Description of Subproject Works. The project would fund works to&#13;

strengthening of the embankments and improvement of six sluices, and building two new&#13;
small pump stations built on the left bank of the Tianguan River to protect about 11 km2&#13;
of farmland and the Jianghan oil field.&#13;
18.        On the Hong Lake, works to be funded would include (a) raising and&#13;
strengthening of 104 km of dikes; and (b) slope protection on 14 km of dikes and&#13;
improvement of four sluices.&#13;
19.        In addition, the project would fund works to (a) install four second-stage&#13;
pumps in the Nantaogou area with a capacity of 16 m3/sec and a service area of 34 km2;&#13;
and replacement of old pumps at Loaxin and Xingou by 10 new energy-saving pump units,&#13;
each with a capacity of 9 m3/sec; and (b) construction of local drainage networks,&#13;
including subsurface drainage to improve about 28,000 ha.&#13;
20.         The project would also help improve operations by providing funds for&#13;
communications, technical and office equipment; vehicles (22 in total); training and study&#13;
tours. Support would be provided for strengthening the SWB and county WRBs to carry&#13;
out planning and project preparation work, and implement a management information&#13;
system. Funds would also be provided to the Research and Experimental Center at Jinzhou&#13;
to look at drainage and water management issues.&#13;
21.         Mathematical Model. In order to prepare and evaluate the above proposals,&#13;
an optimization model has been developed and used. The project would provide support&#13;
to upgrade this model so that it could guide future improvement and also constitute a basis&#13;
for developing a real-time operating system in the future. The work would be the&#13;
responsibility of the SWB, which would contract the Design Institute to execute it. The&#13;
project would provide funds for computing equipment and software; local and foreign&#13;
experts; and training. Funds would also be provided to pay the Design Institute for its&#13;
services and for data to be purchased from other institutions.&#13;

reducing seepage from irrigation works, drought management, water-saving techniques,&#13;
siltation in irrigation systems and investigating different types of intakes and regulators.&#13;
The project would also fund procurement of some research equipment. Specifics and&#13;
details of research would be agreed upon during project implementation.&#13;
Strengthening of Provincial Water Resources Institutions&#13;
24.         The project would provide support to the Hubei Water Resources&#13;
Department (WRD), the Design Institute and the Research and Training Center. The&#13;
assistance to the WRD and the Design Institute would focus on upgrading their capacity&#13;
for planning and project preparation, and providing backup to lower-level WRBs on&#13;
improved O&amp;M. The project would fund various technical and office equipment, including&#13;
a CAD system; field survey equipment; vehicles (1 4WD and 4 minibuses); and local&#13;
training and study tours. A total of 33 months of overseas training would also be funded,&#13;
mostly to cover areas related to O&amp;M and planning and development of large irrigation&#13;
and drainage areas, including issues related to the environment and water quality control.&#13;
The Research and Training Center would also be strengthened in order to improve its&#13;

production; tapping the latent potential of land and water resources; improving farmers'&#13;
livelihood; removing the key constraint to economic development of Yueyang City.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67-                         ANNEX 1&#13;
Through construction of the two subprojects works and improving operation and&#13;
maintenance and water management; strengthening water resources institutions and&#13;
supporting reforms of water resources laws, regulations and organizations; serious water&#13;
shortage problem that has restricted agriculture development will be solved thoroughly and&#13;
water supply will be guaranteed, 80 percent of the time, for the newly developed&#13;
wasteland. Also, though the construction of these works, the increasing demand for&#13;
industrial and domestic water in Yueyang City could be met.&#13;
26.         Criteria for selection of subproject ares are the same as in Hubei. Based on&#13;
that criteria, the irrigation districts of the project were selected in Longhui, Shaoyang,&#13;
Xinshao, Yueyang and Linxiang counties. The two irrigation subprojects in Hunan,&#13;
Liaduzhai and Tieshan, were selected accordingly and would be financed under the project.&#13;
Liuduzhai Subproject&#13;
27.         Present Situation. The Liuduzhai irrigation area, which is one of the&#13;
poorest areas in the Province, lies in the central part of Hunan in Longhui, Shaoyang, and&#13;
Xinshao counties. The subproject area is a hilly area with two layers of undulating planes&#13;
at elevations of 450 m and 600 m. The prevailing soils are lateritic and paddy soils. The&#13;
multipurpose Liuduzhai Reservoir on the Chanshui River was completed in 1990, with an&#13;
effective storage capacity of 79 million m3. However, due to lack of finance the&#13;
downstream conveyance system was not completed, except for a stretch of 3 km of the&#13;
main canal, and presently the dam is largely used for producing electricity.&#13;
28.         Description of Subproject Works. The project would support completion&#13;
of the main irrigation conveyance system and help farmers with the improvement of&#13;
on-farm works. Funds would be provided for construction of 37 km of Main Canal, and&#13;
three branch canals (east, south and north), with a total length of 91 km. The project&#13;
would also fund construction of an 800 kW pump station at Yishi to lift water 33 m, and&#13;
a canal to take water from this pump station to irrigate 1,650 ha in the northern part of the&#13;
subproject area (see Table 2). A total of 88 subbranch canals, laterals and sublaterals&#13;
would also be constructed to irrigate about 4,500 ha. The project would also provide some&#13;
support to farmers for on-farm improvements. The proposed network would provide&#13;
water from the Liuduzhai Reservoir to 24,200 ha.&#13;
29.        In addition, and in order to efficiently manage the new irrigation network,&#13;
the project would provide support for improved operations. Funds would be provided for&#13;
buildings (3,300 m2); equipment (Table 3); vehicles (one minibus and 3 4WD); local&#13;
training and study tours (Table 4). Funds would also be provided for the creation of&#13;
WUAs but it is proposed that the use of these funds be reviewed after evaluating the&#13;
experience of the pilot areas.&#13;
Tieshan Subproject&#13;
30.         Present Situation. The Tieshan irrigation area is located in the northeast&#13;
of the Province, bordering on Dongting Lake. The area is a hilly land where elevations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                        ANNEX I&#13;
of ground generally vary from 50 to 150 m, forming a relief high in northeast and low in&#13;
southwest with interchange of high hills and low hills. Most soils in the project area are&#13;
red loam and paddy soil. The main water storage facility in the area is the Tieshan&#13;
Reservoir on the Shagang River, which was completed in 1986, with an effective storage&#13;
capacity of 383 million rn3. Due to lack of funds, work on the North Irrigation Area was&#13;
suspended after construction of 10 km of the main canal.&#13;
31.        Description of Subproject Works. The project would support completion&#13;
of the main irrigation conveyance system and help farmers with the improvement of&#13;
on-farm works. Funds would be provided for construction of another 45 Ikm of Main&#13;
Canal, which would supply water for 25,800 ha. The Main Canal would include 24&#13;
tunnels (5.4 km), 14 aqueducts (4 km) and a number of structures such as culverts and&#13;
gates. Downstream works include two submain canals (24 km) and two branch canals&#13;
(28 km). The project would provide some support to farmers to carry out on-farm&#13;
improvements to handle the increased supply of water. In order to supply untreated&#13;
drinking water for Yeuyang City, an open channel (2.2 km) and a tunnel (3.5 km),&#13;
together with a 10 million m3 storage reservoir (Jinfeng reservoir) would be constructed.&#13;
32.        In addition, and in order to efficiently manage the new irrigation network,&#13;
the project would provide support for improved operations, the Tieshan irrigation authority&#13;
would be provided with funds for buildings (5,600 rnr); equipment; vehicles (two&#13;
minibuses and 3 4WD); local training and study tours (Table 5). Tieshan is one of the&#13;
pilot areas where new financially autonomous irrigation authorities and WUAs would be&#13;
created. Support would be provided for the creation of WUAs from the first year of the&#13;
project.&#13;
Dongting Lake Research Subproject&#13;
33.        Present Situation. The Dongting Lake area is located on the right bank and&#13;
in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and covers a total area of about 18,800 km2,&#13;
most of which is in Hunan Province (15,200 km2). The remaining portions are in Hubei&#13;
Province. Water from four additional rivers join the Yangtze River by passing through the&#13;
Dongting Lake area, causing a delta-type landform in the area. These four rivers (the&#13;
Xiangjiang, Zijiang, Yuanshui and Lishui) have a total catchment area of 230,000 km2 and&#13;
when combined with three inflow areas from the Yangtze River (46.3 percent of inflow&#13;
in flood season) result in a mean annual runoff from the Dongting Lake area to the&#13;
Yangtze of 301.8 million m3. The rainy season is from May to October and 75 percent&#13;
of this runoff is during this period. The siltation caused by these flows is another&#13;
complicating factor. Each year 192 million tons of sediment enters the Dongting Lake&#13;
area, with the Yangtze River accounting for over 82 percent of this total.&#13;
34.         The Dongting Lake area is a poldered area with 227 polders that protect&#13;
600,000 ha of farmland and over 10 million people. A total area of about 10,200 km2 is&#13;
protected by dike.  The existing flood control and drainage system is extremely&#13;
complicated with 3,471 km of flood control dike. The dikes create 227 polders that vary&#13;
in size. The water management system presently consists of 2,411 pumping stations, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                        ANNEX 1&#13;
4,582 pump sets having a combined installed capacity of about 550,000 kW and a designed&#13;
flow capacity of about 5,500 m3/sec. Of this total, 380 larger multi-unit pumping stations&#13;
are designed to take water out of the poldered system. The infrastructure system for water&#13;
control also includes: (a) 8,667 drains that are 23,000 km long, (b) 72,000 structures,&#13;
including 3,400 sluice-gate structures to provide gravity drainage, and 13 diversion canals&#13;
to take upland water away from the poldered areas.&#13;
35.         Research and Studies to be Financed by the Project. To guide future&#13;
investments in the Dongting Lake area and to provide proper operation and management,&#13;
modeling work is necessary. Studies and research to facilitate inputs to this model and&#13;
improve the productive capacity of agricultural lands are required. In addition to providing&#13;
guidance for infrastructure investments, the model will be designed for future use as an&#13;
operational tool to facilitate monitoring of the physical system with automatic feedback&#13;
control features for system operation and management. Research will involve detailed&#13;
analysis and studies in at least two polders to provide typical input information for the&#13;
modeling. The project would also provide funds for computing equipment and software,&#13;
local and foreign expert (60 staff-months and 30 staff-months), and training (12 staff-&#13;
months local and 6 staff-months foreign). Funds would be included to pay for Hunan&#13;
Design Institute services and for data to be purchased from other institutions. The study&#13;
would represent the first phase for rehabilitation and improvement of the flood&#13;
communications network in the lake area. The results of the study are expected to improve&#13;
the operation of flood diversions in the mid-Yangtze and the operation of drainage facilities&#13;
in the lake area for reducing waterlogging, and may lead to designs for improving flood&#13;
communication networks in the lake area.&#13;
36.         Dongting Flood Forecasting and Warning System. The project will also&#13;
fund a three-year study to improve rainfall-runoff modeling and real-time flood forecasting&#13;
in the Dongting Lake area. The study will cover: (a) flood forecasting and information&#13;
processing, including the establishment of three information processing centers with data&#13;
banks using GIS (real-time, historical, and socioeconomic and human a-tivity data in flood&#13;
prone polders), forecasting modeling that integrates information from the data banks and&#13;
from radar and satellite images, and analysis of risk and a methodology to assess and&#13;
monitor flood damage for flood diversion operations; and (b) design of a flood-wamning&#13;
communications network in the Dongting Lake area. This will be an integrated part of the&#13;
overall National Flood Control and Information Plan, which was completed in 1993 and&#13;
is under the coordination by MWR for its implementation. The project would also fund&#13;
procurement of equipment and training.&#13;
37.         Iplementation. The study would be implemented in a three-year period.&#13;
A Study Coordination Group (SCG) has been set up to carry out the work. SCG consists&#13;
of the Hunan Provincial Water Resources Bureau, Hunan Hydrological Master Station,&#13;
Flood Control Communication Center (FCCC), Design Institute for Hydroelectric Projects&#13;
(DIHP), and Dongting Drainage Management Bureau. In addition, YRWC would assist&#13;
Hunan with the design of the flood forecasting and warning system for the Dongting Lake&#13;
area.&#13;

39.         The project would fund several research topics including: methods to&#13;
optimize design and operation of waterlogged and drainage areas, improving low-yield&#13;
lands, testing of water-saving techniques, optimizing operation of the vine and watermelon&#13;
irrigation system, developing water utilization coefficients, investigating the causes and&#13;
treatment of swelling soils, and studying the implementation of a computerized database.&#13;
C. Topics COMMON TO HuBmI Am HUNAN COMPONENTS&#13;
40.         The following points are applicable to all or some of the subprojects in the&#13;
two provinces and were designed to improve and enhance the performance of the two&#13;
subprojects and would be supported under the project.&#13;
41.         Plan for Operation and Maintenance (POM). To best meet project&#13;
objectives and retain project integrity at least cost, project operation and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;   aspects, in the broader sense, must receive careful attention at all stages prior to&#13;
commencing services, as well as thereafter. The management must be well planned and&#13;
consistent, as every aspect of O&amp;M is interlinked. A Plan for Operation and Maintenance&#13;
(POM) for each subproject is required for this purpose. The POM is a permanent set of&#13;
documents, updated when changes are made so that it comprises a complete statement for&#13;
reference and guidance at a every level in the project organization. It was agreed that a&#13;
POM for irrigation and drainage subprojects be prepared, according to a reference&#13;
guidelines, and sent to the Bank for review by December 31, 1996. This plan should be&#13;
the basis for the operation and management of the two subprojects. Development of the&#13;
POM would be coordinated with management turnover to Water Supply Corporations&#13;
(WSCs) and Water User Associations (WUAs) in the development of Self-financing&#13;
Irrigation and Drainage Districts (SIDDs, Annex 6).&#13;
42.         SIDD  Development Support.   Support for WSCs' and WUAs'&#13;
establishment and operation and would be financed under each subproject. This would&#13;
include equipment, computers, vehicles and minibuses, mobile VHF radio, research,&#13;
.0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71-                          ANNEX 1&#13;
training (for both farmers and WSC staff), and foreign and local study tours. SIDD&#13;
development pilot projects and technical assistance plans are described in Annex 6.&#13;
43.         Improved Design Standards. Improved design standards should include:&#13;
(a) water measurement devices on canals, reservoirs and offtakes for operational purposes&#13;
and SIDDs; (b) steel gates; and (c) geotextiles used for construction. The former is&#13;
especially important both for efficient operation and for system water accountability, water&#13;
charges and SIDD development. The financial viability of WSCs will depend on accurate&#13;
water measurement and water accounting, in order to charge for water delivered to users&#13;
(WUAs).&#13;
44.         Remote Monitoring System. The project would support development and&#13;
installation of a remote monitoring system and a decision support system to improve and&#13;
modernize operation and water management of the subprojects (Zhanghe and Dongfeng in&#13;
Hubei, and Liuduzhai and Tieshan in Hunan). The proposal would include (a) remote&#13;
monitoring of water levels in canals and medium-size reservoirs and flows in canals (using&#13;
local processors); (b) radio/VHF communication system; (c) DSS at a central station that&#13;
would include subsystems for office management, personnel management, financial&#13;
umanagement for irrigation districts and water fees collection management; and (d) the&#13;
possibility of installing local control of key points in the irrigation system using&#13;
microprocessors.&#13;
45.         Water Balance. A report on water supply and demand and water balance&#13;
for Hubei subprojects were prepared (except for Sihu Subproject). Detailed calculations&#13;
were also available for Hunan two irrigation subprojects. In that report and calculations,&#13;
the following were included: (a) water supply from main (large) reservoirs, numerous&#13;
small- and medium-size reservoirs; runoff into numerous ponds and usable flows from&#13;
these ponds and reservoirs; (b) water crop requirement using day-to-day calculations of&#13;
field requirements based on effective rainfall, field efficiencies, daily percolation in paddy&#13;
fields; (c) system efficiencies including reservoir utilization coefficient; (d) surpluses,&#13;
deficits and spills; and (e) percentage of guaranteed irrigation for each scheme. Results&#13;
water balance analysis for each scheme (25-28 years period) indicated that water&#13;
requirements for an average irrigated area in each subproject can be met in 80 to&#13;
99 percent of the time (average guaranteed irrigation). The results are shown in Tables&#13;
1, 2 and 3.&#13;
46.         Subprojects' Inplementation Schedules. It is planned that most of the&#13;
subprojects would be implemented in five years (from September 1994 to September&#13;
1999). The general main canal, aqueducts and tunnels would be completed first, while the&#13;
construction of the rest of the irrigation system would be completed within five years. As&#13;
a result of a two preparation training workshops, implementation schedules for each&#13;
subproject, using computer management software, were developed by the project offices.&#13;
This training was very useful, especially for developing implementation and procurement&#13;
schedules for Jiangya Dam. It helped also in improving the planning process for all&#13;
subprojects, and will be a useful tool for monitoring and evaluation of project progress.&#13;
A summary of these schedules are shown in Charts 1.1-1.4.&#13;

HUBEI NONWATER RESOURCE SUBPROJECTS&#13;
AND AGRICULTURE ASPECTS&#13;
A. AQuAcULTuRE SuEPRoJECr&#13;
Objective&#13;
1.          The objective of the aquaculture component is to improve aquaculture&#13;
production in 24 counties/cites in Hubei through increasing fish production in open waters.&#13;
Works Description&#13;
2.          The works under this subproject would include aquaculture development of&#13;
about 12,600 ha in open water, comprised of 17 shallow lakes and reservoirs (some of&#13;
which are seasonal) and farm ponds. Pond development would include the improvement&#13;
of 235 ha of nursery ponds and 365 ha of production ponds, and new construction of&#13;
151 ha and 215 ha of nursery and production ponds, respectively, of the same sizes noted&#13;
above for each. The subproject would also finance the construction of five fish hatcheries,&#13;
one 4.2-ha turtle hatchery, one 1-ha turtle farm, and one 1,000 e2 Technical Service and&#13;
Extension Center (TSEC).&#13;
3.         In addition, the project would finance project management and technical&#13;
assistance (domestic and intemational training, study tours, and consultants) and the&#13;
formulation of a nongovemmental Hubei Province Fish Farmers' Association.&#13;
Flsh Production Technology&#13;
4.          The subproject would support fish production technology in the following&#13;
areas:&#13;
(a)   Open-Water Flsheries. This would include improving fisheries in 17&#13;
selected small lakes/reservoirs. To increase production, each selected water&#13;
area would be stocked with fish, turtle, and/or crab seed based on the&#13;
estimated natural productivity of the site for the various species. [Common&#13;
carp (Cyprinus carplo), bighead carp (Arisdcthys nobilis), silver carp&#13;
(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus),&#13;
Wuchang fish (Megalobrama amblycephala), crucian carp (Cawsius&#13;
auratus), mandarin fish (Sinapercus chautsi), softshell turtles (honyx&#13;
sinensis), and river crabs (Eriocheir sinensis).]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                         ANNEX 2&#13;
(b) Filngerling Ponds. The management of new and improved fingerling ponds&#13;
proposed would follow the best technological practices employed in Hubei.&#13;
The major species that would be cultured include grass carp, silver carp,&#13;
bighead carp, common carp, wuchang fish, and crucian carp.&#13;
(c)   Production Ponds. The improved and new production fishponds would be&#13;
similar to that of the fingerling ponds except they would each cover an area&#13;
of 0.67 ha and have a total depth of about 3 m and operating water depth&#13;
of 2.5 m. The same fish species in polyculture would be reared in&#13;
production ponds as would be in the fingerling ponds.&#13;
(d)   Turtle Ponds.  One hectare of eight turtle grow-out ponds would be&#13;
constructed as a pilot scheme at Baishuitan Fish Farm in Shashi County.&#13;
One of the eight 0.125 ha ponds would be used to rear turdes from 50 g to&#13;
100 g, after which they would be transferred to the other seven ponds for&#13;
grow-out to 500 g market-sized turtles. The grow-out areas would include&#13;
pond and land areas for the turtles.&#13;
(e)   Flsh Hatcheries. Five standard fish hatcheries used for the production of&#13;
Chinese major carp (primarily grass, silver, and bighead carps) would be&#13;
built at five farms in five separate counties/cities.&#13;
(f)   Turtle Hatchery. A 4.2-ha, softshell turtle hatchery would be constructed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
Support Activities&#13;
5.          Technical Service and Extension Center (TSEC). The subproject would&#13;
include the construction of a 1,000 e2 center that would include a fish disease clinic,&#13;
offices and a classroom for extension officers, and the headquarters of the Hubei Fish&#13;
Farmers' Association discussed below.&#13;
6.          Hubei Province Fish Farmers' Association (FFA). The objective of the&#13;
nongovernmental HFFA would be to establish a membership organization that would be&#13;
a direct means within the province for fish farmers to exchange information on their&#13;
experience, be provided with market intelligence, and direct and finance practical research&#13;
on specific problems facing fish farmers in Hubei.&#13;
7.          Technical Assistance, Study Tours and Training. The project would&#13;
include a comprehensive domestic and international training program, including training&#13;
for fishermen, fish farmers, fish and turtle hatchery operators, and turtle farmers benefited&#13;
by the project.&#13;
8.          Research. Research would be conducted on project-related aspects of lake/&#13;
reservoir fishery management (aquatic ecology, fishing strategies,and use of feed and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                        ANNE 2&#13;
fertilizer inputs) and aquaculture (propagation of high-valued species, feed for these&#13;
species, and fish disease prevention).&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
9.          The Hubei Fishery Project Management Office (FPMO) of the Province&#13;
Fishery Bureau would have overall responsibility for implementing the aquaculture&#13;
component. The FPMO would be assisted in construction supervision by counterpart&#13;
offices established in the respective prefecture and county/city Fishery Bureaus.&#13;
Inplementation and Procurement&#13;
10.        The aquaculture subproject would be developed over a five-year period with&#13;
eight specific project units to be initiated in the first year, nine in the second year, and&#13;
seven in the third year. All site development works would be procured through local&#13;
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Water Resources Bureaus&#13;
at the Provincial, and city/county, levels would review and approve design and&#13;
specifications and would certify completion of construction of engineering works. Works&#13;
completed through force account would be required to follow the regulations established&#13;
for the overall project for force account. The purchase of equipment should also follow&#13;
the Bank procurement guidelines.&#13;
Production and Markets&#13;
11.        Production. At full development, the total estimated incremental gross&#13;
revenue from the aquaculture component would be about Y 72 million per year.&#13;
12.        Markets. There is a well-established fish marketing system in Hubei.&#13;
From previous statistics, the marketing of the fish produced by the project should not be&#13;
a problem; fish consumption in Hubei has been increasing at a rate in excess of the&#13;
anticipated production from the project at full development and is expected to continue to&#13;
do so. There also appears to be sufficient market demand outside Hubei should surplus&#13;
fish from the project be available.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
13.        The fish populations play an important role in the ecological function of&#13;
open waters, and the project would help to support fish diversity and production through&#13;
developing a strategic management strategy to meet the specific characteristics of each&#13;
individual lake/reservoir. The proposed new pond construction would be developed in&#13;
fallow areas prone to fostering waterborne diseases (e.g., malaria) and that are generally&#13;
waterlogged, saline, and/or alaline. Pond development would diminish the warborne&#13;
public health hazards by reducing the habitats for the disease vectors. Analyses of source&#13;
water quality at all project sites were found to be within Chinese national standards for&#13;
fisheries (GB11607-89) for each pollutant, independently. However, at some project sites,&#13;
heavy metal and pesticide pollution was detected for more than one pollutant, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -                        ANNEX 2&#13;
cumulative effect of which might pose some problems. The water quality at sites (Jianli,&#13;
Yichang, Shashi, Jinmeng, and Xiantao) of concern should be monitored annualy, and fish&#13;
vitality and condition should be observed for any possible effects each year as well.&#13;
Role of Women&#13;
14.        The project would provide additional employment opportunities for women&#13;
in the project areas. It is envisioned that about 30 percent of the new fingerling and&#13;
production ponds, turtle ponds, turtle hatchery, and fish hatcheries would be contracted to&#13;
female heads of households. The other aquaculture subcomponents would either be&#13;
enhancing open-water fisheries for which there is already an established community of&#13;
fishers, or improving existing ponds that are already contracted to households.&#13;
Beneficiaries&#13;
15.        The project would benefit about 1,835 households, comprised of 460 fishers&#13;
(1 per 27 ha), 1,340 pond contractors (1 per 0.67 ha), 6 turtle hatchery operators, 25 fish&#13;
hatchery contractors (5 per hatchery), and 4 turtle pond contractors (1 per 0.25 ha).&#13;
Project Cost and FSnancing&#13;
16.        The total cost estimate for the aquaculture component would be about Y 127&#13;
milion ($14.6 million), of which approximately Y 25.4 million ($2.9 million) would be&#13;
allocated for working capital. Approximately 50 percent of the cost would be provided&#13;
as a loan from the World Bank, 20 percent as loans from provincial resources, 15 percent&#13;
as loans from prefecture and county/city resources, and 15 percent contributed from the&#13;
benefiting fish farms in the form of labor, equipment, materials, and cash.&#13;
B. AGRiCULTu    SupROJEcrs&#13;
Introduction&#13;
17.        The nonwater watershed protection components comprise activities in&#13;
forestry development, livestock grassland development, and soil improvement for building&#13;
a small fertilizer industry that would support forestry and grasslands activities and those&#13;
of the irrigation districts.&#13;
18.        The subproject areas are located in a total of 23 different counties of Hubei&#13;
and include both irrigated and upland areas. The individual subcomponent locations&#13;
include forestry development in 11 counties), soil improvement in 23 counties, and&#13;
livestock/grassland development in 21 counties.&#13;
19.        The lowland areas are generally under intensive cultivation, following a rice/&#13;
cotton-wheat/rape rotatiom and including a range of other crops such as peanut, soybean,&#13;
maize, tubers and vegetables. Protection forestry in the lowlands is located along stream,&#13;
river and canal banks. Upland areas vary from moderately fertile yellow and red soils in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                         ANNEX 2&#13;
undulating areas with slopes of approximately 8 to 15 degrees to acid, eroded, infertile red&#13;
soils on hills of 25 or more degrees of slope.&#13;
20.         Irrigated area productivity is limited by recurring drought in late summer,&#13;
by relatively dry winters and also by unbalanced ferdlizer applications, particularly&#13;
inadequate supplies of (largely imported) potassium ferilizers.&#13;
21.         Uplands are, on average, moderately eroded over 10 to 20 percent of their&#13;
total area. Deforestation and cropping of slopes above 20 degrees has created localized&#13;
areas of very severe erosion. The whole upland area, moreover, suffers from frequent&#13;
poverty as a result of low cultivated areas per household (commonly less than 0.25 ha),&#13;
low soil fertility, and low productivity.&#13;
22.         The forestry and livestock/grassland development subprojects are located in&#13;
more marginal areas of the lowlands and in the uplands. They are intended to both&#13;
directly protect areas such as stream and canal banks and eroded hillsides (forestry&#13;
subcomponent) and to further develop technology for the protection and economic&#13;
development of lower slopes and marginal sites along rivers (livestock/Grassland&#13;
Development Subproject).&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
23.         Each subproject would be implemented by their respective line agencies-the&#13;
Forestry Bureau, Livestock and Animal Husbandry Bureau, and Agriculture and Animal&#13;
Husbandry Department. A section (soil improvement, water conservation, forestry or&#13;
livestock/grasslands) of a Project Office that would work with a Project Leading Group at&#13;
the county/city level and respond to the Project Management Office at the Provincial level&#13;
is the line agency concerned. The Provincial Project Office would report to the Provincial&#13;
Leading Group.&#13;
Forestry Subproject&#13;
24.         This subproject aims to restore forest cover in watersheds above the main&#13;
irrigation areas, improve the quality of technical services in forestry and improve incomes&#13;
of farm households. The households would include those involved directly in the irrigation&#13;
developments through protection forestry on irrigation works and those in upland areas&#13;
away from irrigation development through protection, timber and economic forestry&#13;
development.&#13;
25.         The Forestry Subproject is oriented toward an agroforestry and farm systems&#13;
approach involving intercropping for the first five to eight years on about 68 percent of the&#13;
planted area, depending on the tree crop involved and its probable growth rate.&#13;
26.         Soil conservation within the subproject would utilize, where possible,&#13;
vegetative rather than traditional structural soil conservation measures such as terracing.&#13;
Lower slopes would be intercropped while steeper areas would be used for protection or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                        ANNEX 2&#13;
timber forestry, with no cultivation of existing vegetative cover. Economic forest would&#13;
be planted on the contour.&#13;
27.         Subproject Location. The project would be implemented in 11 counties on&#13;
the Jianghan Plain (Jiangling, Songzhi, Xiaogan, Yuenmong, and Zhijiang counties) and&#13;
North Hubei hillock area (Laohekou, Xiangyang, Zhaoyang, Suizhou, Yingchen and&#13;
Zhongxiang counties) along the Yangtze and Han rivers.&#13;
28.         Subproject Description. The proposed development would comprise three&#13;
main types of plantings:&#13;
(a)   Economic Forest. A total of 5,718 ha would be planted to peach/plum and&#13;
pear (1,705 ha), citrus (200 ha), chestnut (3,013 ha), Chinese wolfoerry&#13;
(lycium chinense, 200 ha), eucomia (Eucomia ulmoides, 200 ha) and tea&#13;
(400 ha);&#13;
(b)   Timber Forest. A total of 5,000 ha on more marginal sites in both the&#13;
uplands and lowlands would be planted to poplar (Populus deltoides and&#13;
Populus xueranicana, 1,000 ha) and slash pine (Pinus elliotii and Pinus&#13;
taeda, 4,000 ha), principally for pulpwood production and poles; and&#13;
(c)   Protection Forest. Steep slopes and river and canal banks over an area of&#13;
6,000 ha would be protected using plantations of water and pond fir&#13;
(Metaseqoia gIyptostroboides and Taxodiwn ascendens spp, 1,000 ha), slash&#13;
pine (Pinus eUiouii and Pinus taeda, 2,000 ha) and Italian poplar (Populus&#13;
deltoides and Populus xueranicana, 3,000 ha).&#13;
29.        In addition, the subproject would also include construction/expansion of&#13;
training center, forestry establishment, and institution-building including support for&#13;
vehicles/equipment, technical assistance and study tours, training and extension, research&#13;
and management.&#13;
30.         Quantities of compound NP ferdlizer to be applied to trees during the&#13;
establishment period, particularly in year 2, would provide a progressive increase in&#13;
application with increases in tree volume over time. Some NP fertilizer would be applied&#13;
(at half rates compared to timber forestry) to the slash pine protection forestry, in view of&#13;
proven cost-benefit ratios of 30 to 1 for ferilizer on timber (slash pine) forestry.&#13;
31.         Costs for the Forestry Subproject are shown in Table 1. The costs of&#13;
increased fertlizer application are balanced in part by reduced expenditure on seedlings.&#13;
All seedlings to be used would be first class. Planting standards for seedlings are shown&#13;
in Table 2.&#13;
32.         The timber and fruit yield increases of crops where adequate fertlizer and&#13;
first-class seedlings at correct densities are used should be considerable. Current yields&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -                        ANNEX 2&#13;
of peach and plum, for example, are about 4 tons per hectare compared to yields of 15 to&#13;
20 tons in more advanced areas of China.&#13;
33.         Project activities in protection forestry would protect 31 small- and medium-&#13;
size reservoirs, 128 km of main and branch irrigation canals and 109 km of river bank.&#13;
Border plantings would protect 21,500 ha of agricultural land. Timber forest output would&#13;
increase by about 843,000 m3 at year 20.&#13;
34.         The project would involve about 20,828 farm households in the development&#13;
of 14,863 ha, of which 83 percent is currently under collective management and&#13;
6.1 percent is under the household responsibility system. The areas per household for each&#13;
county and forest type are given in Table 4. In general, protection forestry households&#13;
have the largest land areas (average 1 ha), reflecting lower returns per hectare, followed&#13;
by timber forest( 0.9 ha) and economic forest households (0.6 ha). The developments&#13;
would also involve 1,855 ha of state forestland, accounting for 11 percent of the&#13;
development area.&#13;
35.         Research, Extension and Training. The project would require investment&#13;
in research to support both the increases in yield needed for economic justification and the&#13;
process of change from block forestry to an agroforestry approach. The research&#13;
investments are summarized in Table 1.&#13;
Grasslands Subproject&#13;
36.         Rationale and Approach. This subproject would support development of&#13;
grasslands for steer fattening over 19,525 ha of marginal uplands and lowlands (11,415 ha&#13;
in the uplands and 8,110 ha in the lowlands). The project is based on household fattening&#13;
of store cattle from mountain breeding areas. An annual turnover of some 42,000 head&#13;
of cattle is planned at full development.&#13;
37.         Project Location. The subproject would be located in 11 lowland and 10&#13;
upland counties on the Jiangyan plain and the nearby foothill areas. A summary of&#13;
investments for the individual counties participating in the project is given in Table 7. The&#13;
project would also support improvements to the Provincial Livestock Breeding Station in&#13;
Wuhan. The subproject would include activities in upland and lowland grassland&#13;
development (including drainage and irrigation of lowlands), infrastructure construction,&#13;
breeding center redevelopment, research, training, extension, study tours and consultancy.&#13;
A summary of project costs is given in Table 3.&#13;
38.         Project Description. The project would develop grasslands from wastelands&#13;
currently under the direct control of townships or within existing county breeding farms&#13;
owned by city administrations. In either case, the basis of development would be the&#13;
household responsibility system, with contracts for farm development taken out under&#13;
inheritable user rights for a minimum 50-year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                        ANNEX 2&#13;
39.         The areas to be developed are currently unsuitable for arable agriculture,&#13;
because of either soil infertility and periodic drought (upland areas) or periodic&#13;
waterlogging (lowlands). A project risk is that measures such as dams being built in the&#13;
lowlands will, in combination with drainage and irrigation investment under the subproject,&#13;
make the lowland areas more attractive to high-value cropping and result in conversion of&#13;
pastures to cropping.&#13;
40.         The following are the main investments that would be financed under the&#13;
project:&#13;
(a)   Grassland Development. The project would settle some 14,018 households&#13;
from surrounding areas on farms of 1 ha (lowlands) or 2 ha (upland). In&#13;
view of the different yield potentials in each area, upland households would&#13;
fatten three cattle on 2 ha per year from a yield of 6,000 kg/ha of ryegrass/&#13;
red clover (Loliwn perenne)/(trifolium pratense) dry matter, whereas&#13;
lowland households would fatten three cattle per hectare on irrigated&#13;
grasslands producing 12,000 kg/ha of ryegrass/white clover (trifolium&#13;
repens) dry matter. Soils would be improved with an initial application of&#13;
400 kg of 15:15:15 compound fertilizer and adequate annual dressings of&#13;
superphosphates (375 kg/ha) and nitrogen as urea (150 kg/ha). An initial&#13;
dressing of 5 kg/ha zinc, 2 kg/ha boric acid and 0.5 kg sodium molybdate&#13;
would correct micronutrient deficiencies.&#13;
(b)   Individual households would purchase cattle store stock at a weight of about&#13;
100 kg from the surplus stock available from herds in surrounding mountain&#13;
areas toward the end of winter each year. These store stock would be&#13;
fattened for about 12 months, to be sold at the time of the succeeding spring&#13;
festival. Breeding stock in surrounding hill and mountain areas would be&#13;
improved under assistance to the Provincial livestock breeding center. No&#13;
sheep would be included in the project (as originally planned) owing to very&#13;
low returns from lamb production.&#13;
(c)   Silage and Hay Storage. To support livestock production on an annual&#13;
basis, given the harsh winters and late summer drought of the area, the&#13;
subproject would develop about 3.75 m3 (lowland areas) or 4.5 m3 (upland&#13;
areas) of silage pits per ha of grassland developed and construct about&#13;
2.7 m2 (lowlands) or 3 m2 (uplands) of hay storage per ha developed. The&#13;
lowlands would be either drained (Sihu area) or irrigated with a total of&#13;
46 km of canals. Silage and hay storage are based on the requirement for&#13;
about 45 days feeding in late winter of an average 250 kg animal. The&#13;
early winter requirements would be met from hay stored in temporary&#13;
haystacks and later ammoniated with urea, if necessary, according to&#13;
quality. The livestock requirements are based on fattening of three 100 kg&#13;
animals to 400 kg per household per year.&#13;

would be constructed and planted. Live fences would be based on farm&#13;
borders of Chinese wolfberry (Lyciwn chinense), honey locust (Robinia&#13;
pseudoacacia) and Rosa (Rosa hugonis), which would also provide some&#13;
emergency fodder. Costs are based on seed or seedling supply only, with&#13;
planting by voluntary household labor. Roads would be simple tracks with&#13;
stone cobbling of wet areas, constructed with household labor.&#13;
(e)   Drinking Water Supplies. Water supplies would be provided in the&#13;
uplands using shallow (20 m average) wells on the basis of one well per 90&#13;
head of cattle. Wells would be connected to tanks and troughs by small&#13;
electric pumps and polyethylene pipe. In the lowlands, water may be&#13;
pumped from nearby reservoirs or irrigation canals to tanks and troughs.&#13;
Fifty households in the lowlands or 30 households in the uplands would&#13;
share one tank, and 10 households (owlands) or 5 households (uplands)&#13;
would share one trough. Water supply construction would be subcontracted&#13;
to county Water Resource Bureaus, with assistance from farmer labor.&#13;
(f)   Management Buildings.  Functional management buildings totaling&#13;
3,040 m2 would be constructed at each development site at a cost of Y 487&#13;
per in2.&#13;
(g)   Breed Improvement. A cattle breed improvement investment totaling&#13;
Y 2.9 million plus contingencies (approximately Y 3.3 million in total) has&#13;
been included in the subproject. The initiative would involve 13,818&#13;
household beneficiaries outside the grassland development area who&#13;
currently maintain about 20,700 breeding animals. Improved semen would&#13;
be sold from the improved provincial breeding station to county breeding&#13;
stations and distributed to farmers at an appropriate price to cover costs of&#13;
production (Y 1.82 per dose) and distribution costs of about Y 1.0 per dose.&#13;
41.        In addition, the project would finance procurement of 20 locally made 8-ton&#13;
trucks for grassland development activities, a minibus for training, and 3 4WD vehicles&#13;
for upland and lowland supervision work and for the Wuhan project office staff. The&#13;
project would also finance research, training, local overseas study tours and technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
42.         Flnancial Benefits. A summary of topics and costs is given in Table 9.&#13;
The project would increase per capita net income of beneficiaries considerably to Y 1,176&#13;
per year for lowland households and Y 1,120 for upland households. Because of the&#13;
relatively low labor inputs to grazing enterprises, return per labor-day would increase to&#13;
Y 9.7 and Y 8.9, respectively.&#13;
&#13;

- 92 -                         ANNEX 2&#13;
Soil Improvement Subproject&#13;
43.         Rationale and Approach. This subproject has two main objectives: (a) to&#13;
develop a small but efficient fertilizer-blending capacity in support of a program of&#13;
balanced nutrition extension on the basis for a more efficient fertilizer industry; and (b) to&#13;
develop an alternative method of funding research and extension services with more&#13;
reliance on local self-funding of operations and maintenance through utilization of the&#13;
profits from fertilizer sales.&#13;
44.         Project Location. The subproject is located in 23 counties on the Jianghan&#13;
plain. Only about 25 percent of subproject area overlaps with the irrigation development&#13;
subproject areas, however, so that only a restricted area would receive benefits from&#13;
technically superior irrigation and soil improvement. The project would improve some&#13;
152,500 ha of arable lands in total.&#13;
45.         Project Description. The subproject would include the following activities:&#13;
(a)   Fertilizer Mixing Stations. The subproject would finance six central&#13;
fertilizer mixing plants of a size (30,000 tons/year) in each irrigation district&#13;
that would be competitive in a future free-market fertilizer industry. The&#13;
mixing plants are supported by adequate (2,000 m2/plant) storage capacity&#13;
for raw  materials and bag fertilizer.  Procurement of mixing plant&#13;
machinery would be by ICB, and a study tour to the United States would be&#13;
used as an aid to design of mixing plants. Construction would be planned&#13;
and finalized only after this tour.&#13;
(b)   Fertilizer Supply Stations. Smaller storage of 500 m2 (11 counties),&#13;
750 m2 (3 counties) and 1,000 m2 (2 counties) would be constructed in&#13;
counties supplied by the central plants.&#13;
(c)   Agricultural Service System. This would include investment in building&#13;
construction/improvement for research (four research institutes), extension&#13;
and training (including renovation of the Jinzhou training center and two soil&#13;
improvement stations), and training equipment and costs for training of&#13;
mixing station technicians, soil testing technicians, extension staff and&#13;
farmers in the institutes. Two cars for administration and seven pickups for&#13;
extension are included.&#13;
46.         In addition, the project would support research, training, local and overseas&#13;
study tours and technical assistance needed for this subproject.&#13;
C. AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT SERVICES TO IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT IN HUNAN&#13;
47.         While no World Bank-funded investments in agriculture in Hunan are&#13;
planned under the project, the Provincial Government would provide the funding of&#13;
adequate agricultural support services to ensure the success of the irrigation investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                        ANNEX 2&#13;
at Liuduzhai and Tieshan. The Tieshan area is well-endowed with natural resources and&#13;
industry, enabling a large degree of self-funding, but the Liuduzhai district is a poor area,&#13;
with 25 percent of households below the poverty line, which will require increased outside&#13;
support (fertilize chemicals, credit, extension and training) to make best use of funds&#13;
invested in irrigation.&#13;
D. AGRICULTuRAL AspECS OF REsETrLEmSENT FROM JIANGYA DAM-HUNAN&#13;
48.         Resettlement of households from the area to be inundated by Jiangya Dam&#13;
involves 2,956 families, with 12,587 residents of nine townships in three counties. A total&#13;
of 15,783 people including dependents will, however, require rehabilitation of livelihood,&#13;
since in some cases agricultural land but not homes will be inundated. The most severely&#13;
affected township is Longtawan (93.9 percent of farmland lost), followed by Renchaoxi&#13;
(43.4 percent),  Jiangkou  (34 percent),  Changtanping  (25.7 percent),  Linxihe&#13;
(19.8 percent), Zhuyeping (12.3 percent), Tielu (10.5 percent) and Guandiping&#13;
(0.1 percent). No loss is incurred in Baishi (although this is only a small town with&#13;
0.2 percent of the agricultural population of the area). The counties affected are Cili&#13;
(which will resettle residents of Longtawan township), Sangzhi and Hefeng (in Hubei).&#13;
49.         About 935 ha of agricultural land will be inundated, of which 65 percent is&#13;
paddy land, and the remainder is sloping dryland. In addition, 132 ha of fallow land,&#13;
102 ha of orchard and 365 ha of timber forest will be lost.&#13;
50.         The resettlement plan involves both agricultural and commercial/industrial&#13;
enterprises. Agricultural areas for livelihood reestablishment will include 67 ha of paddy,&#13;
348 ha of tea, 394 ha of oranges (plus a further 127 ha of existing orchard to be purchased&#13;
from host townships), 33 ha of pomelo, 322 ha of Eucomia, 133 ha of Magnolia, 33 ha&#13;
of Phellodendron, 209 ha of Cape jasmine, and 788 ha of Chinese fir timber forest, plus&#13;
69 ha of waterways would be used for fish breeding. A total of 2,454 ha (excluding&#13;
fisheries) of agricultural development will replace the 1,535 ha lost.&#13;
51.         Resettlement standards have been decided after financial analysis and will&#13;
be based on one or a combination of the following areas (per capita basis, 3.8 persons per&#13;
household):&#13;
Fruit orchard           0.13 ha&#13;
Tea                     0.13 ha&#13;
Medicinal herbs         0.13 ha&#13;
Aquatic breeding        0.17 ha&#13;
Timber forest           2.00 ha&#13;
Paddy                   0.10 ha&#13;
52.         Settlers will receive the same areas, of the same quality (or an increased area&#13;
of lower quality) land as they lost, in terms of income potential. These standards are&#13;
similar to those currently being used on many other projects, such as the World Bank-&#13;
supported Red Soils II project in five southern provinces. Management of tree crops will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                         ANNEX 2&#13;
be by the collective system during establishment but will revert to household responsibility&#13;
after bearing commenoes.&#13;
53.        In general, the agricultural plans are well-conceived.   The main&#13;
implementation issues involved in the agricultural plans are:&#13;
(a)   Most settlers will be changing from annual to perennial crops and will&#13;
require training. On the basis of a national standard of training, one farmer&#13;
in five as a lead farmer, and assuming 2,956 male or female heads of&#13;
household, would mean that about 600 settlers should be trained. An&#13;
increased training budget is required.&#13;
(b)   There is a need to diversify the household farm model so that each&#13;
household plants more than one type of crop, in order to minimize risk,&#13;
particularly in medicinal herbs.&#13;

JIANGYA MULTIPURPOSE DAM SUBPROJECT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.         Subproject Objectives. The primary objective of the subproject is for&#13;
control of floods and supply of power to the northern Hunan region. Less substantial&#13;
benefits will also result from a more reliable water supply for irrigation and domestic uses,&#13;
and from improved river transportation.&#13;
2.          Currently, flooding in the Songli District is frequent and serious, as&#13;
experienced during the major flood disasters that occurred in 1935 and 1954. In 1935 the&#13;
flood inundated over 78,000 ha of agricultural lands and affected a population of 1.44&#13;
million, with more than 33,000 lives lost. In 1954, almost all of the protective dikes were&#13;
breached, agricultural area flooded reached 55,400 ha and a population of 783,000 was&#13;
affected. Very serious flooding also occurred in 1964, 1980, 1983 and 1991. Even after&#13;
massive work in raising and strengthening dikes, the current flood protection standard is&#13;
estimated at holding back floods of a return interval of only four to seven years. These&#13;
production levels are deteriorating because of sedimentation in the lake area, primarily&#13;
originating from diversion of high flows in the Yangtze to Dongting Lake.&#13;
3.          The overall river basin plan for the Li River envisions the construction of&#13;
26 storage facilities: 17 on the Li River itself, and 9 on the main tributaries (4 on the Lou&#13;
and 5 on the Xi). The full implementation of the plan would provide a total reservoir&#13;
capacity of 11.835 billion m3, of which 2.566 billion m3 will be reserved for flood control.&#13;
In the long term, with provision of facilities of the full plan's flood storage capacity, the&#13;
construction of Three Gorges Project, integrated with raising of dikes and use of flood&#13;
detention basins, it is anticipated that security can be provided against floods of a 50-year&#13;
return period.&#13;
4.          For the short term, protection against 20-year floods could be provided by&#13;
construction of three reservoirs on the Li and its two main tributaries (iangya on the Lou&#13;
with flood storage of 0.75 billion e3, Zaoshi on the Xieshui with flood storage of 0.78&#13;
billion m3, and Yichongqiao on the Li with flood storage of 0.25 billion e3. With&#13;
construction of Jiangya and these three reservoirs, areas above Sanjiankoiu would be&#13;
protected against 50-year floods, while areas below Sanjianlkou the protecdon level would&#13;
only be for the 20-year or smaller floods. Of the three primary flood control reservoirs,&#13;
Jiangya makes the largest impact, because of the amount of catchment controlled and the&#13;
more severe flooding characteristics of the Lou River. It has therefore been selected as&#13;
the first priority for implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -                        ANNEX 3&#13;
5.         In addition to the flood problems, the energy resources in Hunan Province&#13;
are comparatively poor, with only the potential for hydropower resources being relatively&#13;
abundant. While Hunan has some coal resources, which continue to be exploited, Hunan&#13;
still must import coal from other provinces to supplement its own resources. Generation&#13;
expansion plans call for all coal for future large-scale power generation to be imported.&#13;
Exploitable hydro resources are estimated at 12.43 GW and 50.9 TWh, and at the end of&#13;
1992, 29.6 percent of total estimated capacity had been developed. Projects under&#13;
construction would raise this level to almost 50 percent. Installed capacity in the Hunan&#13;
Power System at end of 1992, was 6,523 MW, of which 49.2 percent was hydro.&#13;
6.          The Jiangya Project is designed to have an installed capacity of 300 MW,&#13;
and it is estimated that it will generate 790 GWh per year on average, of which 640 GWh&#13;
is considered to be firm (exceeded in 95 percent of years). The power facilities will be&#13;
linked to the main Hunan Provincial Grid by 220 kV transmission lines.&#13;
Subproject Area&#13;
7.          Location and Setting. The Li River originates in mountainous country and&#13;
is joined by two main tributaries, the Lou and the Xie rivers, before flowing into a low-&#13;
lying lakelplains area (the Songli District) just downstream of Sanjiankou. The river&#13;
morphology in the lake area is extremely complicated. The Li River, after Sanjiankou,&#13;
flows into west Dongting Lake, which is connected to the Yangtze River. In this lake&#13;
region, agricultural and populated areas are situated in 'polder' areas proteced by 531 km&#13;
of dikes.&#13;
8.          Climate. The climate of the Loushui River is classified as subtropical&#13;
monsoon, characterized by warm and humid conditions. The mean annual precipitation&#13;
is 1,650 mm, with 69 percent occurring in the months from April to August. The high&#13;
rainfall can be attributed to the location of the catchment at the junction of cold air masses&#13;
and warm air masses with active frontal movement, and the orographic effect due to the&#13;
orientation of the mountain ridges with respect to the northern direction of warm air flow.&#13;
Furthermore, the catchment is on the track of frequent cyclones.  At the Cili&#13;
meteorological station, mean annual surface temperature is 18.5°C, and mean annual&#13;
relative humidity is 78 percent. Storms occur throughout the rainy season but are most&#13;
severe in June and July. Storm tracks tend to parallel flow direction and generally have&#13;
high intensity, long duration and wide coverage. The most severe storm near the&#13;
catchment area occurred in July 1935 and was located in Wufeng County in Hubei&#13;
Province. The five-day precipitation recorded in the County reached 1,288 mm.&#13;
9.          Hydrology. There are 11 river gauging stations on the Loushui River, four&#13;
with periods of records longer than 30 years. With such long periods of good overlapping&#13;
data, effective correlations between the series were achieved and a reliable 40-year monthly&#13;
runoff series for the dam site was synthesized for use in the designs. The mean annual&#13;
runoff volume at the dam site is 4.16 billion m3 (see Table 1) with recorded annual&#13;
variance ranging from a low to high of 2.68 and 7.0 billion i3, respectively. On average,&#13;
72 percent of runoff volume occurs between April and August.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

10.        Floods have been recorded in historical documents since the 15th century.&#13;
The flood of July 1935 is the most extreme observed in the last 132 years. It was actually&#13;
centered over a nearby catchment area, about 50 km from the Jiangya catchment center.&#13;
The area rainfalls for 24- and 72-hour duration were the largest recorded in China and&#13;
close to the envelope of world maxima. Frequency analysis of the floods observed since&#13;
1951 result in the peak flows and flood volumes in 24 and 72 hours as shown in the table&#13;
below. The peak flow of the flood with 5,000-year return period is estimated at&#13;
15,700 m3/sec and the thee-day runoff exceeds 2 billion mi. The Probable Maximum&#13;
Flood (PMF) was also derived by transposition and maximization of the 1935 storm to the&#13;
Jiangya catchment, with the following results:&#13;

Routing of the largest estimate of the PMF through the reservoir indicated overtopping of&#13;
the concrete dam by a maximum depth of 3.5 m for three hours. The design of the dam&#13;
should take such overtopping into account.&#13;
11.        Flood frequency analyses were also made for four periods of five and six&#13;
months during the winter season between September and March. The analyses are of&#13;
particular interest to determine the risks of overtopping of the upstream cofferdam and&#13;
flooding of the construction site during winter. The results summarized in Table 3 show&#13;
that if, for example, the diversion tunnel has a maximum capacity of 2,000 m3 the risk of&#13;
overtopping is one in five years between September and March, and only one in 20 years&#13;
between October and March. The cofferdam would usually be overtopped at least once&#13;
during the rainy season.&#13;
12.        The mean annual sediment volume at the dam site is estimated at 1.68&#13;
million tons, of which over 95 percent occurs during the flood season April to November,&#13;
with 36 percent during the month of July. The local average silt content (0.4 gr/liter) can&#13;
be explained by the widespread exposure of the limestone and other rock formations&#13;
upstream of the dam.&#13;
13.        Geology and Seismology.  Geologic investigation and exploration for&#13;
Jiangya Dam and reservoir area, which commenced in 1979, continued intermittently&#13;
through 1992 and included:&#13;
(a)   geologic mapping from 1 in 50,000, to 1 in 500;&#13;
(b)   core drilling-15,952 m in 159 holes;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(c)   auger drilling-186 m in 54 holes;&#13;
(d)   exploration adits-3,875 m in 78 drives;&#13;
(e)   two exploration shafts-26 m;&#13;
(f)   7,858 m3 of test pits; and&#13;
(g)   a wide range of in-situ and laboratory, mechanical, chemical and&#13;
geophysical testing.&#13;
14.         The geologic structure of the reservoir area is relatively simple, embracing&#13;
a series of folds, with a general NNE-SSW orientation. The river cuts transversely across&#13;
a series of anticlines and synclines. Sandstones and shales of the Silurian and Devonian&#13;
systems alternate with carbonate formations of the Permian and Triassic systems. The only&#13;
major seismically active fault in the region is the Cili-Dayong fault located about 35 km&#13;
away from the dam site. An earthquake of magnitude 5.0 occurred in 1986 in Dayong&#13;
and, according to historical records, several earthquakes of magnitude less than 3.5 have&#13;
occurred. According to a regional study carried out by the Geological Research Institute,&#13;
the area of the dam site belongs in the category of low seismicity. The most important&#13;
geological considerations in the reservoir is the stability of an old landslide about 1 km&#13;
upstream of the dam site.&#13;
15.         The Miaozui landslide, located 1 km upstream of the dam site has been the&#13;
object of special investigations as the original sliding mass was estimated to have a total&#13;
volume of 3.6 million m3 and a thickness of 20 to 85 m. It appears that the slide once&#13;
blocked the original course of the river, causing it to shift to the right side of the valley.&#13;
The landslide was found to be stable under present natural conditions. However, it is&#13;
possible that the slide could be reactivated during the initial filling period or during any&#13;
rapid lowering of the reservoir level. Experts who have studied the slide are of the&#13;
opinion that the movements would be small and that the landslide does not present a risk&#13;
to dam safety. Monitoring of the landslide during construction and impounding has been&#13;
recommended.&#13;
16.         The river valley at the dam site is relatively symmetrical with slopes of 40 to&#13;
450 on the left bank and slightly steeper on the right bank. The valley is 280 m wide at&#13;
the reservoir level of 236 m above sea level. The dam site is situated on the southeast&#13;
slope of the wide Liuzhiping anticline. The rock formation dips 30 to 45° downstream,&#13;
nearly normal, to the river course. The strata exposed at the dam site from upstream to&#13;
downstream are sandstone and shale intercalations, giving way to limestone at the upstream&#13;
end. The dam body will be built on the lower Permian limestone rock formations, which&#13;
are sound, with shallow weathering and high mechanical strength. Although a total of&#13;
19 minor faults were found in the dam site area, they are mostly compression and sheer&#13;
faults of relatively short length, with fractured zones of up to 1 m and offsets of 2 to 3 m.&#13;
The largest fault in the dam area is 350 m long, with offset of about 3 m. Filling of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -                        ANNEX 3&#13;
faults is not well cemented and karst voids have developed. The intensity of joints and&#13;
fissures in the dam site area is low.&#13;
17.         The hydrogeology of the site, especially the presence of a hot-water aquifer,&#13;
is an important consideration for the design of the dam and treatment of its foundations.&#13;
The hot aquifer is 70 to 90 m deep underneath the dam foundations and outcrops upstream&#13;
of the dam axis in the deepest area of the reservoir.&#13;
18.         Construction Materials. There are eight quarries within 15 km downstream&#13;
of the dam site, and reserves are estimated at about 3.8 million m3 and gravel material is&#13;
2.9 million m3. The quality of these materials meet the demands of the design. Limestone&#13;
suitable for aggregate is abundant in quantity downstream of the dam site. A quarry site&#13;
on the right bank of the Loushui River located in a small hill at the exit of the Jiangya&#13;
gorge, some 5 km away from the dam site was selected after investigation, to be reserved&#13;
for the contractor's use. The quarry is characterized by good quality, and little topsoil.&#13;
Description of Subproject Works&#13;
19.         River Diversion Facilities. Because of the tendency of the river to produce&#13;
intense flooding, and since concrete dams under construction can endure overtopping&#13;
without large losses, the diversion tunnel has been designed to pass dry-season floods only.&#13;
The tunnel will be 550 m long with a cross section of 10 m x 12 m. Both upstream and&#13;
downstream cofferdams are to be RCC and are also capable of being overtopped without&#13;
serious damage. The final crest elevations of upstream and downstream cofferdams are,&#13;
respectively, 153 m and 138 m. The upstream cofferdam will be constructed to an initial&#13;
138 m elevation for the first flood season to match with the resettlement program and then&#13;
raised to the full height prior to the second season. The diversion tunnel will be capable&#13;
of passing 1,500 m3/sec, which is equivalent to a 1 in 10-year flood during the months of&#13;
October to April. However during the rainy season (May-September), flood frequency&#13;
analysis shows that the cofferdam will be overtopped at least once a year.&#13;
20.         Main Dam. Taking into account the topography and geology of the most&#13;
suitable dam sites over an 11 km reach of the river and of availability of construction&#13;
materials, a feasibility study was performed to compare five alternatives consisting of RCC&#13;
gravity dam, RCC gravity arch dam, hollow-gravity dam and combinations of these types.&#13;
As a result of these studies, an RCC gravity dam at the Shuihuiyao site was recommended&#13;
and subsequently approved by the General Planning Institute of Water Resources and&#13;
Hydroelectric Projects and the Planning Department of MWR. The approved layout&#13;
comprised of an RCC gravity dam, flood-handling facilities consisting of mid-level outlets&#13;
and surface outlets, right bank powerhouse, with switchyard and inclined shiplift on the&#13;
left bank.&#13;
21.         The design is for an RCC gravity dam with crest at El. 242 m, lowest&#13;
foundation level at El. 242 m, with maximum dam height of 128 m resulting in a crest&#13;
length of 336 m. The overall concrete volume will be 1.4 million m3. At the time of&#13;
construction completion, the dam is expected to be one of the world's highest and largest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106 -                          ANNEX 3&#13;
volume RCC dams. The total storage capacity is 1.7 billion m3, of which 740 million m3&#13;
will be use for flood storage between April and September.&#13;
22.         The dam will consist of three sections laterally, a central overflow spillway&#13;
section 86.5 m wide with two higher elevation sections on each abutment. There will be&#13;
four overflow spillway bays with a crest elevation of 224 m, controlled by radial gates&#13;
14 m wide and 12 m high. In addition, there are three middle-level orifice spillway&#13;
outlets, located below each pier of the overflow bays, with sill level at 190 m, controlled&#13;
by 5 m wide by 7 m wide radial gates. Flip buckets are arranged at two levels, first for&#13;
the two center overflow bays discharging at El. 190 m, and also for the outer overflow&#13;
bays and mid-level outlets discharging at El. 150 m. The two sets of outflow jets are&#13;
designed to collide with each other resulting in a high levels of energy dissipation prior to&#13;
entering the riverbed. Flow aeration is provided in orifice spillway inverts downstream&#13;
of the gates, and in the outer overflow spillway bays at about half height.  The slope&#13;
immediately downstream of the dam will be covered with a heavily reinforced concrete&#13;
slab anchored to the rock with high-capacity rock anchors, designed to provide confinement&#13;
of the rock foundation, to guard against back erosion of the foundation below the plunge&#13;
pool.&#13;
23.         An irrigation outlet is provided on the left abutment consisting of a pipe&#13;
through the body of the dam. The 1.1 m diameter pipe will be set at El. 200.3 m, and&#13;
will have a design discharge of 4.3 m3/sec. It is controlled on the upstream face with a&#13;
vertical slide gate.&#13;
24.         The dam body will be constructed using RCC, with high fly ash content.&#13;
Construction methods are designed to achieve full bonding at lift joints. As far as&#13;
possible, this will be achieved by continuous placing in 0.3 m lifts such that successive lifts&#13;
are placed before final set of the concrete. Set retardant admixtures will assist in delaying&#13;
the set time. Should the surface set up before the next layer is placed, a bedding mix will&#13;
be required to be applied. The upstream face of the dam will consist of a richer RCC mix&#13;
designed for a higher strength and lower permeability. There will be contraction joints at&#13;
lateral intervals with mechanical waterstops. In addition, an impermeable membrane&#13;
coating will be placed on the exterior of the upstream face to provide an additional water&#13;
barrier. High-strength concrete with silica power additive will be used for the hydraulic&#13;
surfaces of the spillway and mid-level outlets. The downstream face of the gravity dam&#13;
sections will be stepped, which will improve energy dissipation in the event of overtopping&#13;
of the dam by floods. In addition, downstream valley sides will be concreted to reduce&#13;
erosion by water released through the spillway.&#13;
25.         The construction logistics for the nearly continuous placement of the RCC&#13;
will be very difficult due to the large volumes of cement and fly ash that need to be&#13;
brought to the site daily over a rather undeveloped regional transportation system. Some&#13;
storage of these construction materials is planned to be required at the site to allow for&#13;
minor disruptions in the incoming heavy traffic.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-107 -                         ANNEX 3&#13;
26.         Power Facilities. The three power intakes (one for each generating unit)&#13;
will be located upstream of the dam axis on the right bank. They will consist of vertical&#13;
tower-type structures, containing bell-mouthed inlets, trashracks, sliding-type maintenance&#13;
gates, and wheel-mounted emergency gates, each supplying a 6.0 m diameter, 202 m long&#13;
headrace tunnel. Each tunnel is designed to consist of an initial horizontal section 86 m&#13;
long at El. 170 m, followed by a 45 degree shaft and a short horizontal section leading to&#13;
the spiral case inlet. The upper portion of the tunnels will be lined with reinforced&#13;
concrete, while the inclined shaft and high-pressure tunnel are to be steel lined.&#13;
27.         The underground powerhouse is located in the right bank, some 85 m&#13;
downstream of the dam axis, in an area where the rock mass is massive limestone, free of&#13;
significant faults. The main powerhouse cavern has a span of 21 m and a length of&#13;
104 m, including a 32 m erection bay at the right end, and an 18 m long auxiliary bay at&#13;
the left end. A transformer tunnel, with a 18 m span and 90 m length, will run parallel&#13;
to the main cavern and is to be located 30 m downstream of it, while a smaller draft tube&#13;
gate gaUery, 70.5 long with a span of 10 m, will be located 15 m downstream. The&#13;
220 kV, 110 kV switchyard will be at the surface approximately 100 m downstream of the&#13;
powerhouse. There will be two access tunnels to the powerhouse, one from downstream&#13;
into the erection bay, and the second from the elevator in the right dam abutment into the&#13;
auxiliary bay of the powerhouse. A single 11 m x 11 m tailrace tunnel, 380 m long, leads&#13;
back to the river about 510 m downstream of the dam axis.&#13;
28.         Navigation Facilities. The current freight volume using the Loushui River&#13;
is estimated at 20,000 tons/year. First-stage navigation facilities are designed to pass ships&#13;
up to 20 tons, and an annual freight volume of 40,000 tons. The shiplift is to be located&#13;
on the left bank, and is of the rotary table type. Ships, seated on an inclined carrier frame&#13;
traveling on rails at 3.0 m centers, would be winched up an inclination of 1 in 5 to a&#13;
rotary table located just beyond the end of the dam, immediately upstream of it. The&#13;
rotary table, 12 m diameter, of welded steel construction is to be used to turn the ship&#13;
through a 30 degree angle, to line up with the descending track. It will then winched&#13;
down the 1 in 5 incline.&#13;
Subproject Organization and Management&#13;
29.         SubprojectManagement and Long-Range Operations. The Lishui Hydro&#13;
and Power Corporation (LHPC) will be the implementing agency for the Jiangya Dam and&#13;
Power Plant (see Annex 4). A department in LHPC has been established under the World&#13;
Bank Loan Project PMO that is responsible for managing the World Bank Loan and the&#13;
construction of the Jiangya Dam and Power Plant (see Organization Charts 3 and 4).&#13;
30.         During the implementation period, LHPC would employ a qualified&#13;
international engineering firm to provide technical assistance for overall project&#13;
management. In addition, this consultant would provide technical experts in the various&#13;
fields associated with the works, such as a specialist in computerized project management&#13;
tracking systems and in RCC technology. This consultant will also provide guidance to&#13;
the Chinese construction supervision units assigned to the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -                         ANNEX 3&#13;
31.         Design. The design is being carried out by the Hunan Hydro and Power&#13;
Design Institute (HPDI), who have been responsible for investigation and design of the&#13;
project since its inception. During the detailed design stages, several other research and&#13;
design institutes have been contracted to carry out specialized studies including the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)   Institute of Crustal Dynamics, Beijing: determination of in-situ stresses in&#13;
powerhouse area;&#13;
(b)   Hunan Hydropower University: hydraulic models;&#13;
(c)   Changjiang River Planning Office: hydraulic models;&#13;
(d)   Qinghai University: temperature studies in RCC dam during construction&#13;
and operation;&#13;
(e)   Wuhan Hydro and Hydropower University: draft tube hydraulic studies,&#13;
modeling of dam (physical and photoelastic); and&#13;
(f)   National Seismic Research Institute: check of seismology studies and advice&#13;
on reservoir-induced seismicity.&#13;
32.         In addition, and with help from a foreign consultant, the East China&#13;
Investigation and Design Institute has been contracted to prepare ICB bid documents for&#13;
the ICB packages: dam construction and supply of turbines, generators and parts of the&#13;
powerhouse electrical control system.&#13;
33.         Construction Supervision. Being a newly created organization, LHPC has&#13;
not had the resources nor time to create a large and competent unit for monitoring and&#13;
supervising the construction activities of such a major project as the Jiangya Dam and&#13;
Power Project. The activities associated with contract administration and construction&#13;
supervision will be carried out by a combination of LHPC administrative and technical&#13;
staff supported by consulting services firms. Two or three local Chinese organizations&#13;
with experience in construction supervision will be employed to administer the various&#13;
construction and supply contracts on behalf of LHPC.  They will assume the&#13;
responsibilities of "The Engineer" as defined in the tender documents. Additional advice&#13;
and assistance in construction and contract management will be provided by the foreign&#13;
engineering firm.&#13;
34.         Supervision arrangements for this subproject will be as follows. A local&#13;
firm would be appointed as the "Engineer" for the main dam and power station, while a&#13;
foreign firm will appointed as a management consultant that would help the owner and the&#13;
Engineer in the supervision of the subproject. Supervision of the rest of the works would&#13;
be undertaken by local firm/firms appointed for these tasks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -                         ANNEX 3&#13;
Subproject lmplementation Schedule&#13;
35.         The implementation schedule for site preparation works, main dam and&#13;
power facilities is shown in the attached bar charts (Charts 1.5 and 1.6) that have been&#13;
prepared with linking of interrelated activities. This will be used to monitor the project&#13;
progress and status during the implementation period.&#13;
36.         Completion of the works (including the dam, power plant, turbine&#13;
generators, transformers and switchyard to the degree that the first generating unit is ready&#13;
for testing) is scheduled to be on or before October 1, 1998, with the entire installation due&#13;
to be completed by September 1, 1999.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
37.         Near the completion of the project facilities, additional staff will be hired&#13;
and assigned to permanent suborganizations of LHPC to carry out the duties of operations&#13;
and maintenance (O&amp;M) for the dan and power facilities. Some of the staff will be&#13;
experienced personnel reassigned from other Hunan projects, while others will be trained&#13;
for the lower-level positions. The majority of the senior staff will be on site during the&#13;
final stages of construction and especially for the period of installation and commissioning&#13;
of the power generating equipment and for operation of the dam outlet works and spillway.&#13;
38.         Early in the project, a system for measuring rainfall and river discharge data&#13;
in the watershed upstream  of the dam  will be installed.  This will include the&#13;
communication system to forward the hydrologic information to the operations&#13;
headquarters at the dam and give the operators of the dams outlet works and spillways,&#13;
advance warning of floods or major changes in river flow. This will also be used to guide&#13;
the contractors during the later stages of construction when there will be activities&#13;
constrained by river flow or reservoir elevation.&#13;
39.         The O&amp;M organization, along with the design engineering groups will&#13;
prepare a Plan of Operation and Maintenance (POM), prior to the start of operations. This&#13;
will provide the detailed operating rules and outline the schedule for maintenance activities.&#13;
The project will also include the procurement and the initial equipment required by the&#13;
O&amp;M staff.&#13;
Dam Safety&#13;
40.         In addition to these conventional arrangements, a Dam Safety Review Panel&#13;
(DSRP) has been appointed to review design and construction aspects of the dam. DSRP&#13;
consists of 12 local and foreign experts, with wide experience in all aspects of karstic&#13;
geology, hydrology, dam engineering and RCC. There are three internationally recognized&#13;
foreign specialists with expertise in geotechnical engineering associated with dams,&#13;
spillway hydraulics and RCC dam design and construction. To date, interaction among&#13;
LHPC, HHPDI, and DSRP has been very positive, and most suggestions of DSRP to&#13;
improve the design have been incorporated into the designs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -                        ANNEX 3&#13;
41.         DSRP will be convened by LHPC during the construction period, notably&#13;
at such time as the foundation area is exposed and geotechnical decisions are being made&#13;
regarding foundation treatment. DSRP will also review the procedures for initial filling&#13;
and start-up of operations.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
42.         Procurement packages have been proposed as follows:&#13;
(a)   Civil Works:  Preliminary Civil Works:  (LCB) Diversion tunnel,&#13;
cofferdams, river closure, foundation stripping.&#13;
Main Dam Civil Contract: (ICB) Foundation Excavation, concrete dam,&#13;

LISHU EIYDRO AND POWER CORPORATION&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          The Lishui Hydro and Power Corporation (LHPC) was registered under the&#13;
Companies Law in March 1993 to manage the development of the Lishui River Basin with&#13;
its initial activity being the management of the construction, commissioning, and operation&#13;
of the Jiangya Dam and Power Plant. The Corporation is jointly owned by Hunan&#13;
Province and the Ministry of Water Resources, each with 50 percent of the shares. LHPC&#13;
has established an organization with departments for River Valley Development,&#13;
Engineering, Finance and Materials Supply, Logistics, Environment and Resettlement, and&#13;
General Administration. In addition, a department is included as the World Bank Loan&#13;
Project PMO, which is responsible for managing the World Bank Loan and construction&#13;
of the Jiangya Dam and Power Plant. Long-range corporation plans include arrangements&#13;
for making the transition from an engineering-type company to a river basin management&#13;
agency for Lishui River Basin.&#13;
Strengthening Lishui Hydro Power Corporation&#13;
2.          The project will provide funding to support the following four aspects of&#13;
institutional strengthening.&#13;
(a) Strengthening Internal Management. (i) Introducing a computerized&#13;
management information system (MIS) into the day-to-day management of&#13;
LHPC, covering general management of personnel, filing and&#13;
documentation; financial management of costs, procurement, contracts,&#13;
payments, disbursement, audit and accounting; and engineering management&#13;
of project scheduling, planning and monitoring. The establishment of the&#13;
financial MIS will be of high priority; (ii) office equipment to support the&#13;
MIS and management functions; and (iii) completing position descriptions&#13;
for managers, management rules and staff training, according to the short-&#13;
and long-term development objectives.&#13;
(b)   Strengthening External Management. (i) Establishing the Lishui Basin&#13;
comprehensive water resources information system, which will assist LHPC&#13;
in decision-making at two levels: real-time management (during Jiangya&#13;
Dam implementation, for flood forecasting and warning for the safety of&#13;
construction, and after dam completion, for efficient day-to-day&#13;
management), and long-term basin planning (reservoir operation for power&#13;
production, water allocation, efficient water delivery to users, water charge&#13;
collection, water and environmental quality monitoring and protection,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-113 -                          ANNEX4&#13;
reservoir  and  other  hydraulic  infrastructure  operations);  and&#13;
(ii) implementing the basin environment management plan, which was&#13;
prepared for construction of the Jiangya dam. The plan deals with the&#13;
environmental management and monitoring of construction, resettlement,&#13;
and land use.&#13;
(c)   Conducting Four Special Studies. The project would fund four specialized&#13;
priority areas of study: (i) pricing structure of electricity, water and flood&#13;
control. The study will select price models, determine proper pricing&#13;
structure, and define ways of fee collection for power, flood control and&#13;
water under varying demands. It would examine options for cost recovery,&#13;
and help formulate policies and guidelines for basin operations;&#13;
(ii) investment analysis to conduct economic analysis of investment models&#13;
for water development schemes. It would carry out analyses of alternative&#13;
financing methods, costs/benefits, and investment priorities. It would&#13;
update the Basin Master Plan and help in formulating investment plans for&#13;
LHPC; (iii) optimization of multireservoir operations. This study will&#13;
include an assessment of the basin's meteorological and hydrological&#13;
monitoring network, design of a telemetry monitoring system, and study of&#13;
rainfall-runoff relationships and flood forecasting models. Optimization&#13;
models for multipurpose basin management will be considered; and&#13;
(iv) basin environmental study. It will include a survey of basin land use&#13;
patterns, estuaries, basin biology, water quality analysis, and a study of&#13;
variations in reservoir water temperature and impact.&#13;
(d)   Equipment.  The project would fund computers, software, office and&#13;
communication equipment, field equipment, vehicles, etc. needed to&#13;
establish and support LHPC operations under the project, and initiate future&#13;
developments as river basin management agency.&#13;
3.          Implementation of the above plan would take about four years. A two-phase&#13;
implementation would be used considering Jiangya dam construction phase. During the&#13;
first three years, the institutional strengthening would serve mainly for implementation of&#13;
the Jiangya dam construction by establishment of the internal management system, the&#13;
external basin information system, and conducting special studies on prices of electricity,&#13;
water and flood control. The forth year's program will prepare LHPC towards reservoir&#13;
operations and basin development. LHPC would contract reputable universities and&#13;
institutes to carry out the four studies above. Technical assistance would be required for&#13;
carrying out the above activities, and a draft TOR for this TA is shown in Appendix A.&#13;
In addition, the project would fund procurement of office equipment for LHPC. This&#13;
equipment would be included in the provincial procurement plan.&#13;
4.          During implementation, LHPC wouldd employ various consultants for&#13;
specialized TA on the above topics and undertake related training, study tours and research&#13;
(Annex 4, Appendix B).&#13;

LHPC Role in Implementing Jianga Dam Subproject&#13;
5.         LHPC will be the implementing agency for the Jiangya Dam and Power&#13;
Plant. Management of Jiangya Dam Subproject construction will be undertaken by a&#13;
special unit (LHPC PMO) under the provincial PMO (see Chart 4). This unit will be&#13;
staffed from LHPC and would be supported by the Corporation.&#13;
6.          During the implementation period, LHPC would employ a qualified&#13;
international engineering firm to provide technical assistance for overall project&#13;
management. A draft TOR for this international consultant is attached (Appendix B). In&#13;
addition, this consultant would provide technical experts in the various fields associated&#13;
with the works, such as a specialist in computerized project-management tracking systems&#13;
and in RCC technology. This consultant will also provide guidance to the Chinese&#13;
construction supervision units assigned to the project.&#13;

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR&#13;
TECBNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR LHPC&#13;
INSTITUTMONAL DEVELOPMENT AND STRENGTBENING&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.          The Lishui Hydro and Power Corporation (LHPC) is cosponsored and&#13;
staffed by personnel from the Ministry of Water Resources, Yangtze River Commission&#13;
and the Hunan Provincial Hydro Power Department (HPD). It is responsible for the&#13;
construction of Jiangya Dam and, after completion, the company will own and operate the&#13;
development of the Lishui river basin. LHPC began operations in July 1993 with the&#13;
design, site preparation and construction of the tunnel for the dam. The Company's&#13;
ultimate objective is to become a financially self-sufficient river basin development&#13;
company similar in concept to the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States. LHPC&#13;
will own and operate the dam and it has the right to develop the Lishui River Basin, which&#13;
includes power generation, flood control, irrigation, transportation, aquaculture, tourism,&#13;
and water supply for city, rural and industrial consumers.&#13;
2.          To achieve its development and investment management objectives, LHPC&#13;
must complete an institutional development and strengthening program that includes&#13;
(a) staffing, (b) construction of an office building and staff housing, (c) staff training,&#13;
(d) development of management systems and procedures, and (e) equipment procurement.&#13;
For LHPC to successfully pursue its river basin development objectives, an institutional&#13;
development and strengthening program should be essentially completed by the time the&#13;
Jiangya Dam begins operation in 1998/99.&#13;
Consultant's Scope of Work&#13;
3.          Technical assistance provided by the Bank would focus initially on the&#13;
development and strengthening of the institutional structure, organizational and internal&#13;
management controls, and internal systems and procedures. While LHPC management and&#13;
staff have experience managing a government water resources bureau at the provincial&#13;
level, their experience with the management of a privately held, profit-oriented&#13;
corporations is limited. Assistance is therefore needed to enable LHPC to make a smooth&#13;
transition from a government bureau responsible for a dam construction project to a private&#13;
TVA-type corporation responsible for the long-range development of a large river basin.&#13;
Three priority areas where technical assistance is needed are (a) institutional strengthening&#13;
and development; (b) financial planning and management; and (c) management decision&#13;
support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Institutional Strengthening&#13;
4.          The tools and techniques of modem corporate management are still largely&#13;
unknown -in China at this time. This lack is one of the major constraints on development&#13;
of the private sector. While it is recognized that the techniques to manage a successful&#13;
bureaucratic organization differ from those required to manage a successful private&#13;
corporation, the differences are not sufficiently understood by those who are directly&#13;
involved in the transition process due to their lack of private sector experience. In China,&#13;
the traditional bureaucratic management style centers around a requirement to fulfill&#13;
employment quotas utilizing subsidies when necessary. There is a natural reluctance to&#13;
recognize that the bureaucratic management style is not only ineffective, it may even be&#13;
counterproductive in a modem private corporation in which a main objective is return on&#13;
investment in the context of capital and budgetary constraints. Furthermore, there is&#13;
essentially no experience with the key prerequisites for effective management: authority,&#13;
responsibility and accountability.&#13;
5.          Technical assistance would be provided by the Bank to assist LHPC to make&#13;
a smooth transition from the bureaucratic to the modem style of private sector&#13;
management. In order to provide the institutional environment to enable effective&#13;
management of the corporate organization and to ensure conformity with the Articles of&#13;
Association and existing laws of China, LHPC management needs to develop (a) corporate&#13;
policies, (b) rules and regulations, and (c) working procedures. These policies, regulations&#13;
and procedures differ materially from those in a bureaucracy because of the difference in&#13;
basic objectives.&#13;
6.          Careful consideration would also be given to the formal definition of each&#13;
board and management position.  In well-run corporations this is done through&#13;
comprehensive position descriptions of each manager's (including board members) specific&#13;
functions, responsibilities, authority, accountability and standards of performance. Once&#13;
the positions and functions are clearly defined, the information required to support each&#13;
one would then be determined.&#13;
7.          The Consultants would, under the direction of the LHPC General Manager,&#13;
carry out the following Scope of Work in the area of institutional development:&#13;
(a)   assist LHPC to develop and implement an effective prQgram to strengthen&#13;
the intemal corporate organization.  Advice and assistance would be&#13;
provided to management to:&#13;
(i)  streamline LHPC's organizational structure;&#13;
(ii) establish lines of communication and feedback;&#13;
(iii) introduce modern corporate management techniques in line with&#13;
governing policies, rules, regulations and procedures; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117 -                          ANNE 4&#13;
Apendix A&#13;
(iv) introduce the management functions related to the exercise of&#13;
authority, responsibility and accountability;&#13;
(b)   assist LHPC to finalize Articles of Association in conformity with Chinese&#13;
Corporation Law and other relevant laws, rules and regulations;&#13;
(c)   assist LHPC to develop corporate policies, rules, regulations and working&#13;
procedures in the context of its corporate development objectives;&#13;
(d)   advise and assist LBPC to design an efficient organizational structure and&#13;
establish lines of communication and feedback for effective control and&#13;
operation; and&#13;
(e)   advise and assist LHPC to develop job descriptions for each level of&#13;
management, including directors, that include the definition of each&#13;
management function in terms of authority, responsibility, and&#13;
accountability, and specifying standards of performance for the exercise of&#13;
each function.&#13;
Financial Planning and Management&#13;
8.          Proper planning is the key determining element of the success of a corporate&#13;
operation with the ambitious development objectives of LHPC. A corporate plan has both&#13;
short- and long-term components that take into consideration all significant requirements&#13;
of present and future business enterprises. The long-range plan typically covers a 10- to&#13;
20-year horizon. Strategic in nature, it establishes the overall direction of the corporation,&#13;
identifying human, financial and other resources required to achieve targeted growth&#13;
opportunities for the enterprise.&#13;
9.          The short-term plan, usually covering a three-year horizon, describes&#13;
specific activities the corporate management commits to undertake to reach its near-term&#13;
objectives. The short-term plan is budget-oriented and includes detailed descriptions of&#13;
specific resources required (staff, organizational, financial and others). It also identifies&#13;
the specific results (in financial and other terms) expected from the employment of&#13;
corporate resources. An effective short-term plan also identifies specific management&#13;
responsibilities for achieving results. It defines the authority provided to each manager&#13;
required to carry out their responsibilities, and provides the methods for determining&#13;
accountability for any results achieved. A proper corporate plan thereby provides the&#13;
Board of Directors and shareholders with an objective means of measuring the performance&#13;
of management.&#13;
10.         Corporate management, in turn, measures performance of the organization&#13;
compared to the short-term plan on a regular basis, usually monthly, and reports such&#13;
results each quarter to the Board and shareholders. Thus, a well-conceived, realistic,&#13;
comprehensive plan is the most essential management tool. Generally the focus of most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -                        ANNEX 4&#13;
Aygndix A&#13;
management meetings, the plan is subject to regular updating and revision on a 'rolling'&#13;
basis such that, at the end of each fiscal year, there should always be a new three-year plan&#13;
presented to the Board for action.&#13;
11.         LHPC requires technical assistance in the development of its long- and short-&#13;
term financial planning and management techniques. This would include the following:&#13;
(a)   methods of setting realistic production, operational and financial targets and&#13;
identifying resource requirements for their achievement;&#13;
(b)   techniques for the preparation, revision and updating of comprehensive&#13;
budgets;&#13;
(c)   techniques for management of financial resources, including sources and&#13;
applications of funds, cash management, loan servicing, retained earnings,&#13;
dividend policy, forecasting, etc.;&#13;
(d)   methods of preparing and presenting analysis of new  investment&#13;
opportunities for Board and shareholder decisions;&#13;
(e)   techniques to identify and report on management responsibilities for the&#13;
achievement of planned performance, and establish limits of authority,&#13;
accountability and standards of performance; and&#13;
(f)   techniques to establish accounting standards and classifications, controls,&#13;
reporting, auditing and accountability consistent with acceptable modern&#13;
corporate accounting practice.&#13;
Management Decision Support&#13;
12.         The ability of key managers to function effectively in a new, rapidly growing&#13;
company is a direct function of their ability to make informed decisions and to exercise the&#13;
proper control to achieve the expected results of their decisions. This requires all&#13;
managers to have access to the specific information to support their decisions at the time&#13;
the decisions are made. Accurate information should be gathered efficiently, processed&#13;
quickly and stored safely for quick retrieval. Management reports should be readily&#13;
available in formats that present decision-oriented information with a minimum of delay&#13;
so that valuable management time is not lost searching through voluminous files for&#13;
information. Tools are also needed to facilitate analysis of information either by staff&#13;
personnel or by managers themselves if they wish to use them. Finally, as an essential&#13;
element of control, management needs a mechanism to follow up the results of decisions&#13;
through an efficient system of feedback reporting.&#13;
13.         Management decision requirements relate to information in the areas of&#13;
planning, programming and budgeting, finance, accounting, performance measurement,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -                         ANNEX 4&#13;
A=ndix A&#13;
material costs, market prices, environmental considerations, personnel, construction&#13;
schedules, joint venture evaluation, among others. Management reports generally include&#13;
(a) comparisons of actual performance versus planned objectives, (b) status of financial&#13;
conditions, (c) organizational and personnel performance, (d) new business developments,&#13;
and (e) impact of changes in the environment on the business. Most management reports&#13;
would be produced by the staff on a regular schedule, but some reports would also need&#13;
to be produced in response to special demands. The staff responsible for the production&#13;
of such reports should be well trained in both analytical techniques and in the use of the&#13;
tools that produce them.&#13;
14.         Management personnel should be involved in the design and specification&#13;
of their decision systems. Systems designers are technicians and cannot be expected to&#13;
have sufficient understanding of the management decision-making processes to enable them&#13;
to meet all management requirements. Direct involvement of management in the design&#13;
process is necessary to ensure that the system adequately supports their decision-making&#13;
requirements. The participatory process that involves management in each step of the&#13;
system design is often known as 'prototyping" and is faster and less costly to develop and&#13;
more responsive than traditional system designs.&#13;
15.        In addition to decision-making, information must also be made available for&#13;
purposes other than intemal decision-making, such purposes as reporting to govemment&#13;
authorities, to financial institutions and shareholders. While financial systems usually&#13;
receive top priority in the development schedule, systems are also useful for planning and&#13;
budgeting, to manage construction, analyze competing investments, automate office&#13;
management, modeling, and other analytical purposes. In such instances, thoroughness,&#13;
accuracy and timeliness of the information is emphasized as is the effectiveness of the&#13;
report design, distribution and feedback process.&#13;
16.         LHPC has recognized its need for the development of information systems&#13;
of the kind described above and has requested technical assistance from the Bank for their&#13;
development. As a result of an inspection of the Provincial Hydropower Department and&#13;
the LHPC offices, there appear to be qualified technical personnel in the area of computer&#13;
technology to assist with the design and installation of basic information systems with a&#13;
minimum of technical assistance, which would be used primarily to provide overall&#13;
guidance and direction needed by the existing staff and part-time programmers already in&#13;
place. LHPC has identified its priorities for the development of information systems as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   Financial and accounting information systems;&#13;
(b)   Office automation systems, including personnel, filing, engineering&#13;
documentation and storage, word processing and desktop publishing;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
Apendix A&#13;
(c)   Basin information system, including data on rainfall, runoff, meteorological&#13;
conditions, environmental protection conditions, and reservoir, pump station&#13;
and other operations;&#13;
(d)   Optimization system to aid in optimizing the planning and construction of&#13;
the 26 reservoirs; and&#13;
(e)  Investment planning model to assist in the analysis, selection and planning&#13;
of joint-venture and other investment alternatives.&#13;
17.        Under the project, technical assistance would be provided to LHPC to ensure&#13;
the early accomplishment of management decision support systems development objectives&#13;
so that it would be of maximum assistance to management. Arrangements will be made&#13;
to contract for specialized technical assistance with a consulting firm that has a&#13;
demonstrated track record of success in the design, installation and management of similar&#13;
large-scale management information systems (IS) in developing countries in Asia. In&#13;
addition to the required technical expertise in systems design and information management&#13;
in Asia, the Consultants would also have in-depth understanding of and extensive&#13;
experience with modern corporate management methods and technology so as to be able&#13;
to efficiently identify and effectively meet requirements for information to support LHPC&#13;
management's critical decisions and routine management functions.&#13;
18.        Consultants would, under the direction and approval of LHPC's General&#13;
Manager, carry out the following Scope of Work:&#13;
(a)  Identify specific information requirements of each management function in&#13;
LHPC (including personnel management; filing and documentation; financial&#13;
management, including fixed assets, corporate capital, planning, budgeting,&#13;
cost control, revenues, procurement, contracting and payments, loan&#13;
disbursement processing and servicing, accounting and internal auditing;&#13;
engineering management, including project implementation planning,&#13;
scheduling, progress monitoring and payment; production and operations;&#13;
and office automation) and prepare a schedule of priorities for MIS&#13;
development, including those for management decision support as well as&#13;
to meet other priority and routine requirements of functions responsible for&#13;
construction, procurement, accounting, etc.&#13;
(b)   Given previously identified priority information requirements of LHPC&#13;
management, prepare a step-by-step program for approval by LHPC to&#13;
develop systems, regulations and procedures to ensure that the MIS is fully&#13;
operational and self-sustaining. The action plan would include a timetable&#13;
for MIS design and implementation, MIU organization and staffing, and&#13;
budgets for training, office space, furniture, equipment, communications,&#13;
transportation, maintenance, supplies, operating overheads and other&#13;
requirements.  The action plan would be computer-based to enable&#13;

management and monitoring of its implementation, and would make use of&#13;
project management software and similar technology where applicable.&#13;
(c)   Prepare and carry out a detailed implementation program, including required&#13;
reporting regulations and procedures, data collection formats, budgets for&#13;
field trips, surveys, etc., considered necessary to ensure the collection of&#13;
essential, timely data in the form of regular and special reports by order of&#13;
priority from all involved field offices and measurement stations.&#13;
(d)   Design and implement efficient systems and timely procedures to collect,&#13;
enter, store, retrieve and maintain accurate data on secure databases at the&#13;
MIIU or at other locations as required to ensure a reliable and sustainable&#13;
flow of essential data to the MIU and the further distribution of decision-&#13;
oriented information to management. Assist LHPC in the design,&#13;
specification and installation of telecommunications equipment and software&#13;
required to ensure efficient data transmission and associated communications&#13;
from remote locations.&#13;
(e)   Prepare and implement a schedule to produce and distribute all required&#13;
reports to LHPC management, feedback to LHPC management and&#13;
concerned personnel, and required reports to outside agencies on a regular&#13;
basis, including monitoring and management reporting on the status of data&#13;
collection and report preparation and distribution on an ongoing basis.&#13;
(f)   Establish management and staff follow-up and feedback systems and&#13;
procedures to analyze, report, recommend and post-audit specific&#13;
management actions required to resolve problems identified (for example,&#13;
on procurement tracking, project progress, withdrawal and reimbursement&#13;
application preparation, etc.).&#13;
(g)   Complete MIS systems documentation, and prepare user manuals and&#13;
training materials on MIS.&#13;
(h)   Prepare and conduct an on-the-job training program for LHPC personnel in&#13;
the effective management, operations and maintenance of MIS/MIU. As a&#13;
part of the on-the-job training process, Consultants shall use their best&#13;
efforts to involve LHPC MIU personnel in all phases of the technical&#13;
assistance. Consultants shall also hold regular briefings for LHPC&#13;
management on the progress of MIS development, including demonstrations&#13;
of system prototypes, so as to gain feedback and ensure that the MIS&#13;
incorporates their suggestions and is appropriate to their needs and&#13;
requirements.&#13;
(i)   Provide software, training and other resources needed to perform special&#13;
analysis, special studies and reports as required by LHPC management for&#13;
construction management, planning, procurement, budgeting, financing, and&#13;
other purposes.&#13;

- 127 -                        ANNEX 4&#13;
AXendix D&#13;
FIANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          Power Unit. A 'new power/new price' policy has been applied by the&#13;
Chinese Government to encourage investment in the power sector since the mid-1980s.&#13;
Under this policy, tariffs for power supplied by new facilities may be set at levels that&#13;
achieve a reasonable rate of return to assets. For power projects financed with domestic,&#13;
nonbudgetary funds, a clearly defined pricing procedure/mechanism was stipulated in&#13;
government regulations. Policy allowing peak/off-peak price parity was also adopted.&#13;
However, for projects financed by foreign funds, the regulations only vaguely stipulated&#13;
that tariffs should be based on costs, taxes and necessary profit. No clear-cut procedures/&#13;
mechanism have been defined.&#13;
2.          Assurance would be obtained from the government that by June 30, 1997,&#13;
a power sales agreement, acceptable to the Bank, would be signed between LHPC and the&#13;
Hunan Power Grid. The agreement would establish:&#13;
(a)   The procedure for setting, and periodically adjusting the average tariff for&#13;
electricity supplied by the Project, to achieve a projected debt-to-service&#13;
coverage of 1.4-1.5 [as a proxy for a real financial rate of return (FRR) of&#13;
no less than 10 percent, on the proportion of the project capital and&#13;
operating costs allocated to power]; and&#13;
(b)   The principles for determining the tariff structure, that is, the proportions&#13;
of the average tariff that are derived from capacity charges and from energy&#13;
charges (which may vary according to time of day and season) to ensure&#13;
efficient dispatch of the power produced by the project, and reduce the&#13;
financial risk due to volatile hydrological conditions.&#13;
3.          With regard to the first provision, the proportion of common cost (dam,&#13;
reservoir, resetdement, etc.) allocated to the Power Unit, using estimated costs and benefits&#13;
at the date of appraisal, and based on the separable-cost/remaining-benefits cost allocation&#13;
methodology, is 49.1 percent.&#13;
4.          The adopted mechanism for tariff determination and adjustment should, as&#13;
far as possible, maintain a constant power tariff in real terms, eliminating the negative&#13;
impact of inflation, and providing for a better match between the cash inflows and outflows&#13;
of LHPC. Acceptable mechanisms would include the debt service coverage ratio method&#13;
Lpara. 2(a), above].&#13;
&#13;

A=endixc D&#13;
5.          FSnancial Management. To increase financial incentives and accountability,&#13;
the government has decentralized its management system  for the sector.  Water&#13;
conservancy institutions were first asked to adopt business management systems in the&#13;
early 1980s. Since the late 1980s, they have been allowed to covert into publicly owned&#13;
corporations whenever conditions permit, and become fully responsible for their financial&#13;
performance according to the Enterprise Law. This trend of decentralization is further&#13;
enhanced by the government decision in 1994 to establish a market economy in China.&#13;
6.          Against this background, LHPC was set up as an independent, publicly&#13;
owned corporation. It will have the same financial autonomy and accountability as other&#13;
publicly owned enterprises have under the Enterprise Law. To enhance the financial&#13;
accountability of LHPC, a profit center would be set up for the hydropower operations,&#13;
and separate cost accounts would be maintained for the water supply, and flood control&#13;
operations. Although cross-subsidization is unavoidable for this multipurpose operation&#13;
because of the very different financial circumstances for the two major operations, the&#13;
actual revenue and expenses of the accounting units would be clearly separated. The&#13;
following discusses the performance of the Power Unit in electricity production and sale,&#13;
and the Reservoir Unit mainly for flood control operations. Revenues from tourism and&#13;
navigation operations would be negligible, and are omitted from the analysis.&#13;
7.          Changing Policy Environment. There have been several policy changes&#13;
that have an important bearing on this analysis. First, in 1989 new guidelines for&#13;
financial/economic evaluation of hydropower projects were adopted by Ministry of Water&#13;
Resources and the Ministry of Energy, in which a FRR of 10 percent was selected as the&#13;
minimum acceptable for a hydropower project. Second, a new accounting system,&#13;
designed in line with internationally accepted practices, was put into effect July 1, 1993.&#13;
The new system substantially increased the financial autonomy of the state-owned&#13;
enterprises. However, implications of the new system for the existing power pricing&#13;
policy, i.e., the 'new power/new price' policy, is still unknown, as details of the system&#13;
are still being formulated. Another important accounting change is formulation of&#13;
regulations for assets revaluation in the water resources and power sectors. These are&#13;
already being tested in some of the large grids of the power sector.&#13;
8.          Reservoir Unit. According to the principle of charging a specified flood&#13;
control fee in flood control areas, a provincial government document was used by the basin&#13;
management authorities to set flood protection charges. The total flood control capacity&#13;
of the planned 26 cascade projects in the Lishui River Basin is 2,564 million rn3, of which&#13;
Jiangya Dam Subproject control capacity would be 740 million i3, accounting for&#13;
29 percent of the total. Revenues from the flood protection operations can be identified&#13;
by the unit charge and total area protected. The flood control fee in Jiangya protection&#13;
area would be charged as follows: commercial enterprises at 2 percent of their sales;&#13;
industrial enterprises at 0.2 percent of their total fixed assets; and residences, agriculture,&#13;
forestry, etc. at 120 kg of rice per ha (valued at Y 0.8/kg of rice). Fees would be paid&#13;
to the Hunan Provincial Flood Protection Fund which was established in January 1995.&#13;
Annual payments would be made from this fund to LHPC to cover flood O&amp;M costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -                         ANNEX 4&#13;
AXn~dix D&#13;
9.          In addition to the organizational setup, the project would enhance financial&#13;
management of LHPC by facilitating institution building, including (a) training technical&#13;
assistance in financial management for LHPC; and (b) agreements with LHPC and the&#13;
government on financial performance targets that would provide a framework for financial&#13;
discipline.&#13;
10.         With a view to obtaining economic efficiency and promoting prudent&#13;
financial management, assurances would be obtained from LHPC regarding the following&#13;
financial performance targets for its power and flood control operations:&#13;
(a)   LHPC would take all measures, including, but not limited to, tariff&#13;
adjustments to ensure that internal cash generation from its power unit is&#13;
sufficient to maintain a debt-service coverage ratio of no less than 1.4 times&#13;
in 2000, and no less than 1.4-1.5 times thereafter for its power unit.&#13;
(b)   LHPC/Hunan would set the water rate and flood protection fee to be paid&#13;
to LHPC at a level that would recover no less than the full O&amp;M costs by&#13;
the tenth year of operations. LHPC would also take all necessary measures&#13;
to ensure that the collection rate for the water and flood protection fees&#13;
would not be lower than 80 percent by the tenth year of operations.&#13;
11.         To buffer the impact of volatile hydrological conditions, LHPC would also&#13;
establish a reserve fund of at least 15 percent of annual cash requirements for operations&#13;
and debt service would be set up and maintained with retained earnings. No new&#13;
investments would be financed or dividends paid with retained earnings when the ratio is&#13;
below 15 percent.&#13;
Objectives of Financial Analysis&#13;
12.         A financial analysis of LHPC was carried out aimed at estimating an&#13;
appropriate price level for the power generated and recommending a pricing mechanism&#13;
that will ensure its realization. The analysis also tested the financial health of LHPC&#13;
accordingly. Conventional financial analysis is less critical due to the limited operating&#13;
cost of the hydropower. The model was used to test the various scenarios for power price,&#13;
LHPC financing, costs, etc.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
13.         Taking into account the special features of the project as mentioned above,&#13;
the analysis was carried out in the following steps. First, separate projected financial&#13;
statements were established for the corporation as a whole and for the Power Unit. The&#13;
separable-cost/remaining-benefit approach was used in allocating the common costs to the&#13;
power unit. Other detailed assumptions are listed in the attachment to this appendix. A&#13;
roughly estimated tariff level was used for the financial statements at this first stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -                        ANNEX 4&#13;
Appendix D&#13;
14.        Second, a constant tariff was derived using the 10-percent required FRR&#13;
criterion and was compared with the economic tariffs obtained during the economic&#13;
analysis. This was done to check whether the tariff derived was consistent with real&#13;
economic data.&#13;
15.        Third, using the required FRR as a benchmark, the price determination&#13;
approach was tested for its susceptibility to inflation, smoothness of the derived prices, and&#13;
whether price levels are appropriate compared to the economic tariff level. The approach&#13;
is the debt service coverage ratio method (World Bank definition), where tariffs are&#13;
adjusted every year so that during repayment, predetermined ratios between net revenue&#13;
and total debt service requirements can be maintained.&#13;
16.         Fourth, the future financial health of LHPC and the Power Unit was checked&#13;
under each pricing assumption.&#13;
17.        A spreadsheet model was prepared to carry out the analysis. The model was&#13;
designed to test the pricing approach. The model can also handle foreign exchange losses&#13;
and asset revaluation gains, and test other variables.&#13;
Fimdings and Conclusions&#13;
18.        Tariff Level and Pricing Mechanism. The 10 percent required FRR turned&#13;
out to be acceptable. Based on the debt service coverage ratio-based pricing approach, the&#13;
above model indicates that the tariff remains approximately constant at 50 fen/kWh (1994&#13;
constant price) during the first 10 years after commissioning to achieve the required debt-&#13;
service coverage.&#13;
19.        Future Finance Performance. The projections of LHPC's finances for&#13;
1998-2005 are summarized in Tables 1 to 4. The projections are based on the assumptions&#13;
contained in the attachment, which include tariff and flood control charge adjustments&#13;
needed to allow LHPC to achieve the above financial performance targets and conform to&#13;
the agreed power tariff, flood control charge action plan. Under these assumptions, LHPC&#13;
would reach and maintain a strong financial position shortly after the commissioning. By&#13;
the year when the long-term debt is completely paid, funds that could be used for new&#13;
investments would be more than Y 2,004 million (at year 2015), assuming no remittances&#13;
have been paid.&#13;

Apendix D&#13;
Attachment&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN LHPC'S FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
Income Statement&#13;
1.          Power Unit. Tariffs are assumed to be adjusted so that the average&#13;
revenues would be adequate for achieving the required debt-service coverage ratio of no&#13;
less than 1.5-1.6 times. For the purposes of calculating the debt-service coverage&#13;
covenant, internal cash generation has been defined as net income plus operational interest&#13;
and depreciation, amortization of resettlement costs, and expended foreign exchange losses.&#13;
2.          The operating costs consist of separable costs for the power plant and the&#13;
portion of dam operating costs (common costs) allocated to the power plant. Separable&#13;
cost and remaining benefit methodology is also used in the allocation.&#13;

FLOOD FORECASTING AND WARNING SYSTEM&#13;
(In the Middle Reaches of Yangtze River)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.          The Flood Forecasting and Warning System (FFWS) was originally proposed&#13;
by the Government for Bank financing under the Yangtze Basin Water Resources Project&#13;
at a cost of $12.8 million. The PHRD grant has been used to assist its preparation, and&#13;
preparation of parts of the feasibility study. However, due to policy changes related to&#13;
internal loan payment issues, the Government decided, at negotiation, that FFWS would&#13;
be financed entirely by the Central Government, using the local Capital Development&#13;
Fund. Given the importance of the FFWS in the development of the Yangtze River Basin,&#13;
the Government intends to implement FFWS along with implementation of the Yangtze&#13;
Basin Water Resources Project.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.          The middle reach of the Yangtze stretches from Yichang to Huko, a length&#13;
of 938 km (Map IBRD 26385R). The Three Gorges area above Yichang is the main&#13;
source of flash floods in the middle reach, due to high storm concentrations. The direction&#13;
of storms often follows the direction of streams. In the middle reaches, the Yangtze River&#13;
is joined by four local tributaries from the Dongting Lake area: Xiang, Zi, Yuan and Li.&#13;
A peculiar combination of hydrology and topography make this area subject to frequent and&#13;
severe flooding, which has long been the main environmental factor affecting the&#13;
ecosystem and human health in the middle reach of the Yangtze (Tables 1, 2 and 3).&#13;
3.          Most current engineering measures for flood control in the basin are below&#13;
the standards required for floods with return periods of more than 50 years (50-year flood).&#13;
In Hubei, for instance, the existing dikes and levees protect against a 10-20 year flood, and&#13;
in Hunan production levels are for only 4-7 year floods. Diversion into the retention areas&#13;
helps protect downstream cities but does not solve the flooding problem due to the large&#13;
number of people residing in those areas.&#13;
4.          Despite its economic importance, potential high flood risks, and a well-&#13;
recorded history of floods, the Yangtze River has an outdated, antiquated and reliable flood&#13;
forecasting system. Most monitoring equipment and facilities were installed in the 1950s&#13;
and 1960s. The existing forecasting facilities do not produce accurate measurements of&#13;
flood water stages, which are crucial to operation of flood diversions into detention areas&#13;
near the Jingjiang reaches below Yichang. Real time forecasting is generally unavailable,&#13;
and transmission of information depends largely on wired telephones and telexes sent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -                        A'NNEX 5&#13;
through postal services, which are very unreliable during flood seasons when&#13;
communications are most needed. Even more critical to the operation of a flood-&#13;
forecasting system and protection of human life in the areas at risk are facilities for&#13;
issuance of warnings to the large population in the middle reach, which are also out-of-&#13;
date.&#13;
Basin Development and National Flood Control and Information Plans&#13;
5.          The Yangtze Basin Comprehensive Development Plan (approved by the State&#13;
Planning Commission in 1990) gives top priority to flood control in the middle and lower&#13;
reach. The focus in the short-to-medium term is on improving river channels in the&#13;
Jingjiang section, constructing flood diversion and safety areas according to upgraded flood&#13;
control standards, and improving nonstructural measures for flood control. The Flood&#13;
Forecasting and Warning System (FFWS) would be a major nonstructural measure.&#13;
6.          The draft National Flood Control and Information Plan was prepared under&#13;
the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) in June 1993. The overall national scheme&#13;
consists of seven river basin plans prepared by the respective river basin commissions and&#13;
authorities. The Yangtze Water Resources Commission (YWRC) is responsible for&#13;
preparation of the flood forecasting and information system plan for the entire Yangtze&#13;
Basin. The Yangtze plan would be implemented in several phases. The first phase-the&#13;
proposed FFWS-would deal with the middle reach due to high flood risks in that area.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
7.          The main objectives of the middle reach FFWS are to: (a) improve flood&#13;
forecasting, warning, dispatching and operation in the mid-Yangtze basin to mitigate flood&#13;
damage and to protect human life, property and economic and social activities in the area;&#13;
and (b) improve real-time hydrological data and information gathering, analysis and&#13;
dissemination to better harness the water resources of the basin.&#13;
FFWS Activities and Components&#13;
8.          There are six major activities:&#13;
(a)   Installation of 36 telemetry data collection platform (DCP) stations and&#13;
upgraded monitoring equipment in the upper-middle reach of the Yangtze&#13;
River;&#13;
(b)  Introduction of large-scale satellite and microwave/VHF radio data&#13;
transmission technology to improve real-time rainfall and flow discharge&#13;
data collection;&#13;
(c)   Establishment of a central station in Wuhan and three subcentral stations to&#13;
receive and process data, and to issue flood warning and operation&#13;
instructions;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -                        ANNEX 5&#13;
(d)   Establishment of a real-time database and an interactive flood forecasting&#13;
system, and incorporation of advanced telecommunication and computerized&#13;
systems into the current conventional monitoring network;&#13;
(e)   Establishment of a  comprehensive  microwave  and  VHF  radio&#13;
communications network to improve flood warning and operations; and&#13;
(f)   Training of YWRC staff and conducting of scientific research.&#13;
9.          The above activities can be divided into four systems, which would be&#13;
improved as follows.&#13;
10.        Hydrological Data Collection System.  The system  would include&#13;
installation of 36 DCP stations including: 27 hydrological stations which measure water&#13;
levels, discharges, sediment and rainfall; and 9 water level stations (pressure transducers&#13;
and float type recorders). Ten of these DCP will be located at the main stream of the&#13;
upper reaches between Cuntan an Yichang, and 26 in the middle reaches at the mouths of&#13;
the four-tributary area of Dongting. Three subcentral stations be set up at Changsha,&#13;
Yichang and Shashi at existing YWRC hydrological offices. Each station will be&#13;
responsible for handling field data, sending data to the central station, and carrying out&#13;
O&amp;M for field stations.&#13;
11.        Data Transmission System. The system would upgrade data transmission&#13;
and communication by the use of satellites and line-of-sight VHF radio, and by establishing&#13;
a microwave line network connected to the existing lines for flood warning and&#13;
dispatching. The 26 DCPs in the Jingjiang and Dongting Lake regions would be equipped&#13;
with duplex transmission system (as a system back-up) to allow both satellite and ground&#13;
radio transmission. Satellite transmission only would be used in the 10 DCPs located&#13;
upstream between Cuntan and Yichang, where microwave and VHF radio communications&#13;
are not easily available.&#13;
12.         Satellite resources available include the Japanese GMS, the Chinese weather&#13;
satellite Fenyun-2 (FY-2), and the INMARSAT communications satellites. FY-2 is&#13;
scheduled to be launched in 1995 and will have adequate time slots to accommodate all&#13;
DCP transmission. FFWS would be easily switched, should the Chinese FY-2 satellite be&#13;
in orbit by the time this project is in operation in about three years. YWRC is also&#13;
exploring the possibility of using the INMARSAT-C (for data reporting), whose rental cost&#13;
has dropped in recent years.&#13;
13.        Flood Forecasting System. The flood forecasting system would include:&#13;
(i) establishing a real-time database system for information handling and processing; (ii)&#13;
introducing better real-time flood forecasting modeling which would be integrated into the&#13;
systems; and (iii) providing better warning information services. A satellite receiving&#13;
central station would be set up at YWRC headquarters and would down-link data from the&#13;
36 DCPs via satellite, microwave and radio. Computer technology would be used to allow&#13;
selection of forecasting models, calibration methods and hydrological parameters on-the-fly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -                        ANNEX.5&#13;
and in real-time. An "expert system" would be built into calibration algorithms to assist&#13;
decision making. FFWS would provide almost instantaneous information on rainfall and&#13;
water stages for decision-making. Advanced computer hardware and software programs&#13;
would be procured. The system would forecast changes in water levels and flow discharge&#13;
hydrographs in 14 key control stations from Cuntan down to the middle reach. In&#13;
addition, scientific research would be carried out on DCP sensor technology (e.g., use of&#13;
pressure transducers for water level measurements), interface among satellite and ground&#13;
radio transmissions, flood forecasting models, and software development.&#13;
14.        Flood Warning and Communications System. The system would consist&#13;
of installation of a communication network for flood operation and dispatching. This&#13;
would consist of establishing two backbone microwave lines and a mobile communications&#13;
network. The new network would connect the three major cities: Yichang, Wuhan and&#13;
Changsha, and would require 14 additional microwave relay stations to be built under the&#13;
project. The microwave network would serve three principal functions: (i) transmitting&#13;
emergency flood warning from the central station to subcentral stations and existing local&#13;
flood dispatching offices in the middle reaches; (ii) general communication links between&#13;
Beijing, Wuhan, Yichang, and Changsha for flood operation instructions; and (iii) relay&#13;
of field data from VHF radio to the central station.&#13;
15.        The network would cover 6 key flood control districts (Wuhan, Yichang,&#13;
Jinsha, Shishou, Jianli and Honghu) that are vulnerable to flooding in the middle reach.&#13;
Mobile communications networks will be set up in the six districts. The new system would&#13;
improve the timely communication of hydrological information between the Jingjiang dike&#13;
area and flood diversion areas during emergencies. The network would also provide&#13;
effective and direct communications between Wuhan, Beijing, and provincial, prefecture&#13;
and county level offices for flood dispatching along the key flood prone areas in the middle&#13;
reach.&#13;
Costs&#13;
16.        The total investment cost of FFWS is estimated at US$12.8 million, which&#13;
will be financed entirely by the Central Government. Table 4 presents detailed cost&#13;
estimates. Estimated annual operation and maintenance costs for FFWS total about&#13;
US$172,000 (Y 1.5 million), at current prices (1994).&#13;
Benefits&#13;
17.        The main benefits of FFWS, when established, are expected to come from&#13;
real-time hydrological and flood warning information provided to Hunan and Hubei&#13;
provinces, which are frequently under threat of severe flood. FFWS would improve the&#13;
accuracy and reliability of flood forecasting and provide incremental lead time of at least&#13;
three hours in issuing warnings. The expected socioeconomic benefits would include: (i)&#13;
reduction of human casualties; (ii) better management of the water resources of the basin;&#13;
and (iii) reduction in the loss of public and private properties. Only the latter benefit has&#13;
been quantified and included in the economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -                        ANNEX 5&#13;
18.        The ERR is taken as the primary index for economic evaluation of the&#13;
component, based on a with and without the project comparison. The analysis shows a&#13;
satisfactory ERR of 28 percent. Sensitivity analysis using switching values shows that the&#13;
component would remain viable with an 82 percent increase in costs or 46 percent&#13;
reduction in benefits.&#13;
19.        The analysis considers the minimum three-hour increase in forecasting time,&#13;
but does not quantify the value of improved accuracy and reliability of forecasting by&#13;
FFWS. An increase in forecasting accuracy would reduce economic losses by helping the&#13;
decision making process on flood diversion (i.e., avoiding diversion and consequent losses&#13;
when they are unnecessary), and could even help avoid destruction of diversion levees.&#13;
Therefore, the actual ERR can only be greater than the estimated value above. An&#13;
additional benefit would be better utilization and management of the water resources of the&#13;
Yangtze Basin through improved databases, computer facilities and institutional capacity&#13;
building financed under the component. These benefits, though difficult to quantify, would&#13;
have a positive long-term impact on the development of the basin.&#13;
Organization and Implementation&#13;
20.         YWRC would be the executing agency for FFWS, under the guidance of&#13;
MWR. A Project Leading Group for FFWS has been set up in YWRC. Its functions will&#13;
be policy related decision-making, coordination among agencies, review of project&#13;
technical reports and implementation plans, and reporting to MWR and senior management&#13;
of YWRC. Under the Leading Group, a Project Management Office (PMO) has been set&#13;
up to carry out day-to-day management of FFWS implementation. The functions of PMO&#13;
include coordination and/or management of: project technical design; procurement;&#13;
financial planning and provision of counterpart funds; implementation and supervision;&#13;
project audits and progress monitoring; and external affairs.&#13;
21.         Under the PMO, five units have been established for project implementation:&#13;
Planning and Finance, Technical Management, Construction Management, General&#13;
Administration and Procurement (Chart 5). Each unit has two to three staff for running&#13;
day-to-day management. The actual implementation in each of the above five areas will&#13;
be carried out by a leading YWRC Bureau which will collaborate with other concerned&#13;
bureaus of YWRC.&#13;
22.         The PMO would establish a Project Advisory Group consisting of local and&#13;
international experts. They would review technical design and assist the PMO in providing&#13;
technical advice, evaluation, and supervision during project implementation. YWRC would&#13;
collaborate with the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) for use of weather&#13;
satellites and for the exchange of hydrological and meteorological data. It will also&#13;
collaborate with the provincial Water Resources Bureaus in Hubei and Hunan to coordinate&#13;
with related irrigation, drainage and local flood control activities.&#13;
&#13;

23.           The implementation period for FFWS is expected to be three to five years.&#13;
The Government plans to implement FFWS simultaneously and in coordination with the&#13;
Yangtze Basin Water Resources Project.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
24.           Procurement for FFWS would consists of two parts, civil works and&#13;
equipment. It is expected that approximately $7.1 million of imported, high technology&#13;
equipment will need to be procured.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
25.           The FFWS should include technical assistance and training on project&#13;
management (engineering and financial), interface among various communications&#13;
subsystems, procurement, and interactive flood forecasting. Technical assistance would&#13;
be provided by local and international experts and by the project Advisory Group.&#13;
26.           The FFWS should also include overseas and domestic training for YWRC&#13;
staff in: (a) technical fields of mobile communications and interactive flood forecasting&#13;
and computer networks; (b) system operation and maintenance; (c) management fields of&#13;
project supervision/monitoring and financial management; and (d) management information&#13;
systems.&#13;

SELF-FINANCING IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE DISTRICTS&#13;
Introduction and Objectives&#13;
1.          General. The Yangtze Basin Water Resources Project includes a broad&#13;
range of water resource activities, a major focus of which is on the development of water&#13;
resources that are essential to the improvement of China's agricultural performance. The&#13;
Project intends to establish self-financing irrigation and drainage districts (SIDDs) on a&#13;
pilot basis, first on two irrigation subprojects in Hubei Province (Zhanghe and Dongfeng),&#13;
and on one subprojects in Hunan Province (Tieshan). Each SIDD would comprise: (a) a&#13;
Water Supply Corporation (WSC) that would operate and maintain the reservoirs and main&#13;
and branch canals; and (b) Water User Associations (WUAs) that would be formed to&#13;
operate and maintain the lower-level irrigation systems and purchase water from the WSC.&#13;
After successful SIDDs are developed and tested on a pilot basis, the program would be&#13;
extended to other subprojects under the project (Yindan and Wenxia in Hubei and&#13;
Liuduzhai in Hunan), and perhaps other projects in the two provinces and eventually to&#13;
irrigation projects in other provinces.&#13;
2.          The objectives of the SIDD pilot projects would include the following:&#13;
(a)   In support of government objectives, to introduce institutional reform that&#13;
would improve water resource management and promote government policy&#13;
objectives for cost recovery, self-financing and self-management of&#13;
irrigation projects.&#13;
(b)   As the basis of the above reforms, to establish SIDDs that would be:&#13;
(i) legal entities under unified management for each subproject;&#13;
(ii) based on hydraulic instead of administrative boundaries;&#13;
(iii) under the ownership, management control and responsibility of&#13;
farmer-users;&#13;
(iv)  more responsive to user demand and needs; and&#13;
(v)  a basis for future expansion of self-financing and self-management&#13;
concepts and practices to other irrigation projects in the provinces.&#13;
(c)   To reduce and eventually eliminate dependence on government subsidies of&#13;
water charges and relieve the government from its historic burden of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -                        ANNEX&#13;
providing ongoing system operations and maintenance. To help ensure&#13;
long-run sustainability, irrigation projects must be freed from the limitations&#13;
and uncertainties of govemment budgets. This is the most fundamental goal&#13;
of the proposed SIDD establishment, which would be accomplished by:&#13;
(i)  organizing independent entities (WSCs) that would sell water to&#13;
WUAs based on accurate, equitable standards that would recover&#13;
capital and operating costs, and in turn provide WUAs with the&#13;
required management and technical services to assure reliable and&#13;
adequate water delivery in the long run. This type of operation will&#13;
require good water measurement capability at all reservoirs, canals&#13;
and offtakes to enable accurate water accounting in the system; and&#13;
(ii)  forming water user associations (WUA) that would purchase water&#13;
from WSCs and would increasingly assume ownership and&#13;
responsibility for the design, construction, maintenance and&#13;
management of delivery systems at their level.&#13;
(d)   Enact supporting rules, regulations and policies at the Provincial and other&#13;
relevant levels of govemment to ensure effective management&#13;
implementation of SIDD procedures and practices, including turning over&#13;
responsibility and at least a share of ownership and control of facilities to&#13;
WEA and WSC organizations, and the establishment and enforcement of&#13;
appropriate water charge rates and standards.&#13;
3.          SIDD Organizational Characteristics. The ultimate ideal SIDD would have&#13;
two key organizational characteristics:&#13;
(a)   An independent Water Supply Corporation (WSC), owned and funded by&#13;
and responsible to water users, other beneficiaries and investors. The WSC&#13;
would be responsible for constructing, funding and managing the systems&#13;
that ensure a sustainable supply of water to WUAs at a price that would&#13;
recover all costs; and&#13;
(b)   Water User Associations (WUAs) that would exert the major influence over&#13;
decisions related to the design, construction, maintenance and operation of&#13;
their distribution systems and would pay the full capital, operating and&#13;
maintenance costs of their distribution systems through water charges and&#13;
labor contributions.&#13;
4.          These ideal characteristics provide a target objective and guide for activities&#13;
under the SIDD development program, and for development of procedures and practices&#13;
for SIDD establishment. Although this general institutional and organization pattem for&#13;
self-financing and self-managing irrigation entities has been proven over many centuries&#13;
in other countries, it will have to be adapted for application under Chinese conditions. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -                         ANNEX&#13;
major objective of SIDD pilot programs will be to develop, test and implement the&#13;
adaptations needed.&#13;
Inplementation Constraints&#13;
5.          It is important to take into account the significant constraints in China and&#13;
in Hubei and Hunan that must be overcome if the implementation of SIDD concepts is to&#13;
be (even partially) successful. The most critical of those constraints are as follows.&#13;
6.          Administered Commodity Prices. Of primary importance is the historic&#13;
fact that farmers do not have access to a free, market-determined pricing system for their&#13;
produce, especially rice which is the major irrigation crop in the two provinces. Although&#13;
for some crops, prices are now approaching free-market prices, various controls and&#13;
impediments to trade still appear to hold rice prices substantially below free-market prices,&#13;
including possible barriers to export rice across provincial borders. The lowest price for&#13;
imported rice is currently reported to be about Y 5.00/kg, while the price of the highest-&#13;
quality domestic rice is Y 3.00/kg. Procurement prices are currently at about Y 0.84-&#13;
0.88/kg for low-quality rice (paddy) and Y 1.04-1.08/kg for the highest-quality rice.&#13;
Although private traders offer a 40 to 50 percent price premium, prices received by&#13;
farmers are clearly held well below international prices.&#13;
7.          As a consequence, water charge standards as set at the Provincial level must&#13;
recognize the farmer's limited ability to pay, and are fixed low-too low to provide&#13;
sufficient funds for proper system operation and maintenance (O&amp;M). Furthermore, actual&#13;
collections are only a fraction of the low standards. In the past, the deficit in the amount&#13;
required for proper system O&amp;M and actual collections, at least in theory, has been made&#13;
up through government subsidies. In actual practice, however, subsidies were insufficient&#13;
to provide for effective O&amp;M, and consequently the physical systems deteriorated to the&#13;
point where major investments are now required for rehabilitation. The system of&#13;
administered prices and barriers to trade, in combination with subsidies, deprives farmers&#13;
of the incentives they need to operate, maintain and pay for the O&amp;M of their own&#13;
systems, reduces their sense of ownership of the systems, and creates a continued&#13;
dependency on government bureaucracy to provide budgets and take care of the systems.&#13;
The result is a deteriorating resource base, reduced operating efficiencies and increasing&#13;
demands on limited government financial resources.&#13;
8.          Requirement for Continued Subsidy. It will be difficult to establish an&#13;
equitable standard for water charges sufficient for farmers to pay the full cost of&#13;
rehabilitation of existing systems, not to mention O&amp;M costs, as long as the price of rice&#13;
is held down. However, ending the control over the price of a basic commodity such as&#13;
rice will be a slow and arduous process, and equity requires subsidies to be continued as&#13;
long as prices remain below free-market rates. The mechanism of price administration/&#13;
subsidy also needs careful attention to ensure that it is operated in a manner that does not&#13;
continue to destroy the farmer incentives to properly operate and maintain their&#13;
rehabilitated irrigation systems in a sustainable manner after establishment of SIDDs under&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -                         ANNEX&#13;
9.          Lack of Farmer Incentives to Participate. Farmers are not organized into&#13;
user associations in which they can take collective action for the full O&amp;M responsibility&#13;
for the system that supplies their water. In order to expect farmers to willingly take such&#13;
responsibility, they must also be allowed to play a major role in the design, construction/&#13;
improvement and operation of the system to ensure, for example, that the design and&#13;
construction utilizes appropriate technology that the farmers are able to operate and&#13;
maintain on a sustainable basis. It has been demonstrated many times in other countries&#13;
that when farmer organizations are involved in the decision-making at each step of the&#13;
design and construction of their systems, they are not only willing to pay O&amp;M and capital&#13;
costs, but are also capable of sustained management of O&amp;M, which reduces the necessity&#13;
of the government to provide subsidies and manpower.&#13;
10.         Existing System of Water Charge Collection. Another constraint is the&#13;
existing complex system of fragmented responsibility for water supply management and&#13;
water charge collection. At present, this comprises: (a) the Provincial Water Resource&#13;
Bureau (WRB) and their management divisions, which handle O&amp;M at the reservoir and&#13;
main canal levels; (b) city and county govemment WRBs, including management divisions,&#13;
district WRBs, water management stations (WMSs), and pump station management&#13;
divisions, which manage the canal network according to their area of jurisdiction but with&#13;
little or no effective oversight, control or direction at the system level; and (c) township&#13;
and village-level water management and water distribution groups. These management&#13;
units are virtually all overstaffed, and the water charges collected at each level are&#13;
allocated to the various management units largely to pay staff costs, including salaries and&#13;
benefits. There are thus strong vested interests at each administrative level. These must&#13;
be dealt with in order to evolve and upgrade the structure of the management system into&#13;
an efficient, cost-effective, market-oriented water supply company (the WSC) that would&#13;
sell water to WUAs and respond effectively to WUA requirements for water and for&#13;
technical and management assistance.&#13;
11.         Physical Condition of Pilot Systems. A final major constraint is the poor&#13;
physical condition of the existing irrigation structures in the pilot project areas, especially&#13;
in Hubei (in Hunan, the two irrigation subprojects under the project will be newly&#13;
constructed). At this time, it is questionable whether the designs and cost estimates for&#13;
system rehabilitation built into the project are sufficient to satisfy farmers that the systems&#13;
they will be required to take over and pay for under the SIDD concept are in fact within&#13;
their ability to maintain. It is especially critical in the pilot stage of WUA formation that&#13;
farmers are convinced that it will be in their best interest to assume full responsibility for&#13;
their systems. In the past, farmers have generally not been involved in design and layout&#13;
of their local systems. It is therefore essential that WUAs be formed, trained and brought&#13;
into this process as soon as possible, and that first priority on their corvee labor&#13;
requirement for construction be allocated to their own local systems as much as possible.&#13;
12.         Technical Requirements.  System design must be such that it can be&#13;
operated (at the lower end) by WUAs/farmers, and as indicated above, it must be in&#13;
satisfactory condition for such operation. Another essential requirement is adequate water&#13;
measurement capability, which should be done on canals and offtakes to supply measured&#13;

water deliveries and at all reservoirs supplying the system or located in the area served by&#13;
the system. This is perhaps more important for operational purposes. However, it is more&#13;
important for the financial operation of WSCs. To be viable, WSCs must have a complete&#13;
'water accounting' similar to their financial accounting system; for them, water is they&#13;
only commodity the sell, and it is the same as money.&#13;
Institutional Development Requirements&#13;
13.        Pilot Project Areas.  In order to deal appropriately with the above&#13;
constraints and develop the institutional, organizational and financial structures required&#13;
to implement the SIDD concept, selected areas were identified within the existing irrigation&#13;
subprojects to serve as models, or pilot areas. In Hubei these include the No. 3 Main&#13;
Canal in Zhanghe, and the Hongtu Branch canal of the No. 1 Main Canal in the Dongfeng&#13;
Irrigation District. In Hunan the pilot area would be selected from within the Tieshan and&#13;
Liuduzhai irrigation project areas.&#13;
14.         Pilot Project Objectives.  A prerequisite to the establishment of a&#13;
sustainable SIDD is the creation of resource-based organizations that would enable farmers&#13;
to assume greater responsibilities for the operation, maintenance and management of their&#13;
water supply systems. By attaining this objective, the project intends to benefit from&#13;
relevant expertise from other countries that have experienced success in similar&#13;
undertakings. With the use of such human resources, the objectives of the Zhanghe Pilot&#13;
WUA Project are to:&#13;
(a)   develop a basic set of operational tools and procedures to:&#13;
(i)  organize and establish Water Supply Corporations and Water Users&#13;
Associations;&#13;
(ii)  introduce the interactive process in which organized farmers or users&#13;
and local authorities for irrigation development and management&#13;
would work together using the comparative advantages of each; and&#13;
(iii) generate and manage the financial, physical and human resources&#13;
required to develop sustainable irrigation facilities;&#13;
(b)   organize farmers of the pilot area into viable Water User Associations.&#13;
Tools and procedures will be developed, tested and revised for future use&#13;
in the establishment of viable WUAs in the project area;&#13;
(c)  train a group of trainers. A team of professionals from Hubei Water&#13;
Resources Bureau, Zhanghe Management Division, Water Resource&#13;
Management Station at Zhanghe, and local governments would be trained&#13;
on WUA organization principles and procedures. These trainers, with&#13;
continued guidance from established experts as needed, would be used to&#13;
replicate the pilot project in Dongfeng and in other areas; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150-                          ANNEX 6&#13;
(d)   establish the WSC. This could be done initially by converting the existing&#13;
management authority to the WSC for operation of the General and Main&#13;
Canals, and Branch Canals down to the WUA pilot areas.&#13;
15.         Technical Assistance Requirements.  The first phase of Technical&#13;
Assistance (TA) would employ two experts for a period of about 12 weeks each, beginning&#13;
in early 1995, in the Zhanghe pilot area. During this initial phase the experts would&#13;
prepare an inception report, prepare and field test a basic set of WUA organization tools,&#13;
procedures and training materials, develop and test model agreements between WUAs and&#13;
WSCs and By-laws for WUAs, and conduct limited on-the-job training of counterpart&#13;
(WSC) personnel, assisting them to organize one or two WUAs as time allows under the&#13;
short span of the initial phase of TA. The final report would recommend additional phases&#13;
of TA required to complete the field testing, revision, training and extension of WUA&#13;
organizations in the Zhanghe pilot area and later to Dongfeng and other areas, and prepare&#13;
draft detailed terms of reference for the second stage of the TA. A draft terms of&#13;
reference for the TA is attached as Appendix A.&#13;
16.         The TA  would also provide for assistance establishment of WSCs.&#13;
Establishment of effective WSCs early in the program is essential, as they would have the&#13;
greatest interest in efficient WUAs and will have responsibility for operation and&#13;
management of the system. This would include development of efficient organizational&#13;
plans, design of efficient management structures, preparation of model Articles of&#13;
Association, development and installation of financial accounting and audit systems,&#13;
development of water measurement and water accounting systems, design and development&#13;
of an efficient computerized management information system (MIS), and development of&#13;
a training program for staff and farmers to support SIDD development. WSC TA may if&#13;
necessary also include assistance for planning the incorporation of existing WRB staff as&#13;
needed, the role of local government agencies and WRBs in SIDD management, allocation&#13;
of voting rights in WSC Boards among various stakeholders (e.g., WUAs/Farmers, the&#13;
WRB, and local governments), allocation of customary (corvee) labor required from&#13;
farmers to the WSC (and WUAs), and coordination with other concerned agencies, such&#13;
as the Agriculture Bureau, to organize provision of increased inputs and extension services&#13;
including credit to WSC areas. Efficient agricultural services are especially important to&#13;
enable farmers to achieve high returns and be able to pay the increased water charges&#13;
required.&#13;
Financial and Cost Considerations for Self-Financing Pilot Subprojects&#13;
17.         Data Reliability. During preparation and appraisal of the project, there&#13;
were attempts to clarify the various elements that make up the cost of water in each&#13;
irrigation subproject so as to enable an analysis of the potential for self-financing. The&#13;
main difficulty in carrying out those exercises was the lack of reliable data on O&amp;M costs&#13;
and water revenues. It was difficult to determine the reliability of cost information from&#13;
second-hand sources, especially since most of it was estimate, and estimates for the same&#13;
cost categories often varied widely each time they were provided. Conceptual problems&#13;
were encountered in the government's accounting treatment of estimated costs, especially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151-                          ANNEX 6&#13;
in the definition, classification and accounting for fixed asset depreciation, a large portion&#13;
of which is comprised of the capitalized labor cost contributions of farmers. It was&#13;
apparent from the discussions with staff personnel that additional training is needed in the&#13;
area of cost accounting, especially in view of the objective of establishing WSCs (and other&#13;
project elements) as independent, semiprivate (or private) entities.&#13;
18.         Estimated Costs in Hubei Province. Despite questions related to concept&#13;
and accuracy, however, the data summarized in Table 1 (attached) appear to enable a&#13;
reasonably comprehensive analysis of the cost of delivering water at each of the four&#13;
irrigation subprojects in Hunan Province, at least in relative, order of magnitude terms.&#13;
It should be noted that in two of the Hubei subprojects the actual water charge was not&#13;
even sufficient to cover wages and benefits (the actual charge in Dongfeng was not&#13;
available at the time of the analysis). In none of the Hubei subprojects was either the actual&#13;
or the standard water charge sufficient to cover estimated operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
19.         Cost Treatment of Flxed Assets. One of the major conceptual problems&#13;
that needs attention is treatment of fixed assets (depreciation). The present practice in&#13;
determining the cost of water includes fixed asset depreciation in the calculation. In China&#13;
the treatment of depreciation is quite different from Western accounting practice.&#13;
Government regulations reportedly require the maintenance of a bank account that is for&#13;
the purpose of accruing the periodic cash charge for depreciation. This depreciation fund&#13;
is then to be used for maintenance, repair and replacement of fixed assets. In Western&#13;
accounting practice, depreciation is considered a "noncash" write-off of the book value of&#13;
fixed assets and there is no accumulated reserve of actual cash. Repair and maintenance&#13;
is generally treated as an expense, while replacement generally adds to the book value of&#13;
the fixed asset. In any event, for most cases encountered in Hunan and Hubei, water&#13;
charges were not high enough to enable the accumulation of a cash reserve sufficient to&#13;
fund even routine maintenance, much less depreciation. While the idea may have merit&#13;
in theory, it does not seem to be very workable in practice.&#13;
20.         Cost Treatment of Loan Repayment. Current practice does not now&#13;
provide for water charges to include loan service (payments of loan principal and interest).&#13;
In the determination of water charges for the purpose of self-financing, conceptual&#13;
problems were encountered because of the historic treatment of depreciation (as a cash&#13;
reserve), which in effect is a proxy for loan repayment. It would be double counting for&#13;
water users to be required to repay the capital cost of an asset (through loan service) and&#13;
the cost of depreciating the same asset. If both loan service and depreciation for the full&#13;
value of fixed assets are included in the water cost calculation, twice the asset value would&#13;
be recovered (assuming the loan is for the purpose of providing the fixed asset). To&#13;
further complicate the matter, a significant amount of the fixed asset value not provided&#13;
by loan funds (generally around 50 percent) is in the value of the labor that is contributed&#13;
by farmers. Farmers should, of course, not have to pay on the water charge for what they&#13;
have already contributed in labor. A determination of the cost of water for the purpose&#13;
of establishing a user rate base water charges needs careful attention to ensure that water&#13;
charges are fair, accurate and based on sound accounting principles. This type of TA may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -                         ANNEX 6&#13;
be required in both Hunan and Hubei to ensure that there is the capability to establish such&#13;
a rate base.&#13;
21.         Treatment of Contributed Labor. User fees should not include a provision&#13;
to repay the cost of an asset that is created and maintained by the labor that is contributed&#13;
by the users themselves. This is especially true in the event farmer organizations (WUAs)&#13;
take over ownership and responsibility for the management and maintenance of their own&#13;
systems. Water charges should then cover only the cost of supplying water from the part&#13;
of the system that the water users do not own, manage and contribute their own labor for&#13;
construction and maintenance. If WUAs/farmers do contribute labor to higher levels of&#13;
the system-to the WSC-their water charge or purchase price for water can be adjusted&#13;
accordingly. Water users should be able to reduce their water charges by taking&#13;
responsibility for larger portions of the system (e.g., upper levels of the branch canals),&#13;
and by selling water to other users who have no ownership of or O&amp;M responsibility for&#13;
the system.&#13;
22.         Incentives for Farmers to Participate. Benefits related to water charges&#13;
and labor allocation to their own systems as above are quickly recognized by farmers and&#13;
will provide strong incentives to participate. In addition, the application of the concept of&#13;
farmer organization (WUAs) is workable in the long run only if farmers are also allowed&#13;
to assume the decision-making and management roles, along with the liability for O&amp;M&#13;
and debt repayment. This gives them a real element of control over the system on which&#13;
they depend and for which they will take increasing responsibility. Perhaps the most&#13;
critical factor, however, is a reliable and sustainable supply of water, without which&#13;
farmers and the WUA cannot survive. Water stress and disputes will reduce willingness&#13;
for cooperation among users. This is especially important given the almost complete lack&#13;
of a system of clearly defined and enforceable water rights.&#13;
23.         Estimated Costs in Hunan Province. In Hunan Province the cost of water&#13;
in Liuduzhai and Tieshan vary widely. Water cost estimates for these two projects are&#13;
shown in Table 2 below. There are two main reasons for such a variance. First, whereas&#13;
the investment in each project is relatively the same, Liuduzhai will supply less than&#13;
40 percent of the water supplied by Tieshan, resulting in a much higher unit cost per cubic&#13;
meter of water for Liuduzhai. Second, Tieshan has a sizable municipal water supply&#13;
component, which can subsidize the irrigation component and keep water charges to&#13;
farmers very low (at about Y 1.00/100 e3). The proposed weighted average water charge&#13;
for Tieshan is about Y 17.46/100 n3, which would be sufficient to fund the total cost of&#13;
the project, including full loan service (estimated at Y 16.14/100 in3). Liuduzhai, on the&#13;
other hand, is a very poor area. A subsidy undoubtedly will be required to cover the high&#13;
cost of water, even without consideration of debt coverage.&#13;
Farmers' Ability to Pay&#13;
24.         For self-financing of irrigation districts to work, farmers must be willing and&#13;
able to pay the cost of water service. The tables discussed above indicate substantial&#13;
increase in water charges will be needed even to cover the full cost of O&amp;M, compared&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -                         ANNEX 6&#13;
to present water charges. Policy in both Hubei and Hunan is to recover the full capital&#13;
cost (excluding the farmer's direct labor contribution). However, it is essential to preserve&#13;
the farmers' incentive to use the irrigation, and the new "self-financing" water charges&#13;
should not take too big a share of incremental farm income. Both provinces recognize this&#13;
and have suggested an informal limit of 10 percent of net income as the maximum water&#13;
charge. Based on the cost data discussed above and the farm model data used in the&#13;
financial analysis for the project, it appears that coverage of O&amp;M costs plus repayment&#13;
(amortization) of part or all of the Bank subloan under the project are approximately within&#13;
those limits. However, recovery of all costs (i.e., including the local counterpart fund&#13;
contribution and "depreciation") may not be feasible in all cases and is likely to be difficult&#13;
(Table 3).&#13;
Budget Support for WSCs and Cost Recovery Studies&#13;
25.         Currently, water charges are generally insufficient to cover the full costs of&#13;
irrigation service, and provincial and local governments generally provide a subsidy&#13;
(budget support) to make up the difference between costs of service and revenue from&#13;
water charges. However, because government budgets are tight and subsidies for irrigation&#13;
are expected to decline in the future, the need to establish SIDD concepts is important to&#13;
ensure the long-run sustainability of the irrigation and drainage schemes and the viability&#13;
of investments under the project. As SIDDs are expected to be self-financing, such&#13;
subsidies would not be needed in the long run. In the near term, however, continuation&#13;
of budget support at current (1993) real levels for WSCs during the project period would&#13;
be needed to maintain farmer incentives to participate, and to avoid discrimination against&#13;
farmers who participate in project SIDDs compared to farmers in nonproject areas. This&#13;
temporary budget support would allow gradual phase-in of water charges at 'self-&#13;
financing" levels, which would be substantially higher than at present. To eliminate the&#13;
need for long-term budget support, SIDDs (WSCs and WUAs) would have to both raise&#13;
water charges and cut costs. This should be covered in the SIDD Cost Recovery studies&#13;
under the project, which could be included under the proposed SIDD TA.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
26.         It is apparent from this analysis that the application of the concept of self-&#13;
financing should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the&#13;
individual physical, technical and financial aspects of each subproject as well as the ability&#13;
of water users to pay. The potential for success in the implementation of the self-financing&#13;
concept is a direct function of the government's commitment to carry out the required&#13;
institutional reforms centered around the organization of WUAs and WSCs, the turnover&#13;
of physical facilities in physical condition that enables sustained maintenance by users,&#13;
accurate determination of water costs, the eventual elimination of administered commodity&#13;
prices, and the establishment of water charges that will cover at least full O&amp;M and loan&#13;
service (minus the subsidy that may be retained in certain cases).&#13;

SELF-FINANCING IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE DISTRICTS&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
Pilot Project Approach&#13;
1.          Project Identification. The irrigation component of subprojects under the&#13;
Yangtze Basin Project cover large command areas in the two provinces of Hubei and&#13;
Hunan. The widespread introduction of new institutional and financial approaches and&#13;
procedures throughout these provinces was considered to be impractical, especially since&#13;
neither the farmers nor local government authorities have any experience with the new&#13;
concepts. Pilot areas were therefore identified where these new concepts and practices&#13;
could be developed and where relevant officials could be trained. In Hubei, the two pilot&#13;
areas selected are: (a) third main canal of Zhanghe; and (b) the Hongtu Branch of the first&#13;
main canal in the Dongfeng irrigation district. In Hunan, pilot areas are yet to be defined&#13;
for the projects in the Tieshan and Liuduzhai irrigation districts.&#13;
2.          Observations.  Field visits were made in the Hubei pilot areas and&#13;
discussions were held with farmers and concerned authorities to obtain a general physical&#13;
and organizational overview of the areas. Some of the findings and observations are&#13;
summarized below.&#13;
(a)   The physical boundaries of the pilot areas defined earlier were based on&#13;
administrative boundaries. Unless the pilot areas consist of well-defined&#13;
hydrological units, the ability to replicate procedures developed and tested&#13;
in the pilot area would be limited.&#13;
(b)   Many of the physical structures within the pilot areas are in poor condition,&#13;
and financial provisions for rehabilitation are wholly inadequate. Attempts&#13;
to organize Water User Associations in areas where the physical structures&#13;
have substanfally deteriorated would have little or no success without a&#13;
concurrent program for their effective rehabilitation. Otherwise, there is no&#13;
incentive for farmers to organize or to assume added financial, operating or&#13;
maintenance burdens, nor should they be expected to agree to do so.&#13;
(c)   Existing information about the pilot areas related to the status of physical&#13;
structures, cost elements, actual water charge collections, existing&#13;

insufficient basis for planning or implementing a program of WUA&#13;
organization.&#13;
3.          Appraisal Mission Recommendations. After the field visits, the Bank&#13;
Appraisal Mission (August/September 1994) was briefed on the field situation in the pilot&#13;
area. The Mission recommended the need to:&#13;
(a)   redefine the physical boundaries in such a way that the pilot areas would&#13;
function as compact, representative, hydraulic units;&#13;
(b)   collect additional information on existing procedures practiced by farmers,&#13;
local government and other related institutions in the use and management&#13;
of irrigation and drainage systems, their cost considerations and pricing&#13;
practices;&#13;
(c)   make necessary provisions to rehabilitate relevant physical structures with&#13;
the involvement of organized farmers, which would include their agreement&#13;
on design and costing and their contribution to the initial investment in cash&#13;
and/or labor;&#13;
(d)   considering financial limitations, and the existing lack of understanding of&#13;
the SEDD concept, the decision was made to begin initial WSC/WUA&#13;
organization activities on a pilot basis in Zhanghe; and&#13;
(e)   due to the limited availability of funding for technical assistance for WSC/&#13;
WUA organization prior to loan effectiveness, it was considered necessary&#13;
to provide such assistance in roughly three stages: (i) limited development,&#13;
field testing of and truining on basic WUA organization procedures in the&#13;
Zhanghe pilot area, (ii) further testing, revision, training, and expansion of&#13;
organization procedures in the Zhanghe area, and (iii) extension of WSC/&#13;
WUA activities to the pilot areas of Dongfeng, Tieshan and (Liuduzhai) in&#13;
Hunan Province after procedures are developed and tested and a cadre of&#13;
trained personnel available based on the experience in Zhanghe.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
4.          Zhanghe Pilot Stage 1. A prerequisite to the establishment of a sustinable&#13;
SIDD is the creation of resource-based organizations that would enable farmers to assume&#13;
greater responsibilities for and control over the operation, maintenance and management&#13;
of their water supply systems. In attaining this objective, the project intends to benefit&#13;
from relevant expertise from other countries that have experienced success in similar&#13;
undertakings. With the use of such human resources, the first stage of the Zhanghe Pilot&#13;
project intends to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -                        ANNEX 6&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
(a)   Develop a basic set of operational tools and procedures to:&#13;
(i) organize Water Supply Corporations and Water Users Associations;&#13;
(ii) introduce an interactive process in which organized farmer/users and&#13;
local authorities for irrigation development and management would&#13;
work together, using the comparative advantages of each; and&#13;
(iii) generate and manage the financial, physical and human resources&#13;
required for sustainable development of irrigation facilities.&#13;
(b)   Organize farmers of the pilot area into viable Water User Associations&#13;
(WUAs). Tools and procedures would be developed, tested and revised for&#13;
future use to establish viable WUAs in the project area.&#13;
(c)   Train a group of trainers. A team of professionals from Hubei Water&#13;
Resources Bureau, Zhanghe Management Division, Water Resource&#13;
Management Station at Zhanghe and local govemments would be trained in&#13;
WVUA organization principles and procedures. These trainers would be&#13;
involved in future efforts to replicate the pilot project in Dongfeng, Hunan&#13;
and in other areas.&#13;
5.          Stage 1 Technical Assistance. The first stage of Technical Assistance (IA)&#13;
to Hubei WRB to assist with early attainment of SIDD development objectives would be&#13;
done by contracting before project start-up with a consulting firm that has demonstrated&#13;
an in-depth understanding of user organization and participation, gained through extensive&#13;
experience with the implementation of farmer-owned and managed irrigation systems in&#13;
Asia, to enable it to efficiently identify and effectively meet requirements for viable SIDD,&#13;
including WSC and WUA organization. The Consultants would also have demonstrated&#13;
success in the design, installation and management of Project Management Information&#13;
Systems (PMISs) in developing countries in Asia using appropriate technology. The&#13;
Consultants would provide two experts for a period of 12 weeks each, beginning around&#13;
April 1995, in the Zhanghe pilot area. During this initial stage the experts would prepare&#13;
an inception report, prepare and field test a basic set of WUA organization tools,&#13;
procedures and training materials, and conduct limited on-the-job training of counterpart&#13;
personnel, assisting them in organizing one or two WUAs as time allows under the short&#13;
time span of the first-stage TA. The final report would recommend subsequent stages of&#13;
TA required to complete field testing, revision, training and extension of WUA&#13;
organizations in the Zhanghe pilot area.  TA would also be provided to Project&#13;
Management Offices (PMOs) to assist in the development of the capability to plan,&#13;
manage, budget and report on activities associated with the construction of Jiangya Dam&#13;
and irrigation subprojects in Hunan, with various water and nonwater components in&#13;
Hubei, and with the specialized PMIS requirements in YWRC. This objective would be&#13;
achieved through a program of PMIS development, implementation staff training to be&#13;
carried out and managed by the agencies involved.&#13;

Water Resources Department (WRD) and Hunan Hydro and Power Department (HPD)&#13;
would agree to incorporate WSC and WUA units into their institutional framework. This&#13;
would be structured to enable the effective functioning of comprehensive and fully&#13;
responsive pilot SIDDs. Hubei WRD and Hunan HPD, in association with Zhanghe&#13;
Irrigation Subproject and Tieshan Irrigation subproject, respectively, should incorporate&#13;
fully and operationalize WSC and WUA units as integral parts of their corporate&#13;
organization and allocate appropriate budgets, create required management and adequate&#13;
staff positions, assign qualified personnel, and procure necessary equipment and supplies&#13;
to enable the WSC and WUA units to fulfill their objectives. Hubei and Hunan Provincial&#13;
governments and other relevant government entities at lower levels would agree to make&#13;
needed improvements in the areas of policy, rules and regulations, institutional and&#13;
organizational arrangements, and manpower necessary to facilitate the establishment of&#13;
sustainable SIDDs.&#13;

ENVIRONMENT AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
A. ENvRoNMErAL MoN1mTNG AND MANAGEMENT PLANS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.          The Environmental Monitoring and Management Plans (EMMP) are based&#13;
on the findings and conclusions of the Environmental Impact Assessment for the entire&#13;
project.j/ Significant environmental impacts related to water requiring treatment under&#13;
the project were identified only for Jiangya Dam and Reservoir in Hunan, and to a limited&#13;
extent for the Sihu (Four Lakes) subproject in Hubei province. The EMMP is in two&#13;
parts: the first covers the Jiangya Reservoir Development in Hunan Provinces (Part I&#13;
below); and the second covers proposed drainage and irrigation developments in the Sihu&#13;
(Four Lakes) area of Hubei Province (Part II below). The Environment and Resettlement&#13;
Panel of experts has been established.&#13;
Part I: EMMP for Jiangya Reservoir Development&#13;
Management Arrangements&#13;
2.          Jiangya Reservoir would be owned and operated by the Lishui Hydro and&#13;
Power Corporation (LHPC), which is jointly owned by the Ministry of Water Resources&#13;
and the Hunan Provincial Government. Construction of the project would be the&#13;
responsibility of the Hunan Water Resources Project Management Office of the Provincial&#13;
Water Resources Bureau, which will ultimately be absorbed into LHPC.&#13;
3.          LHPC includes an Environmental and Resettlement Division (ERD), which&#13;
will have a director and four staff. The four staff members will comprise: a scientist&#13;
(botanist), two water resources engineers and an economist/management specialist. The&#13;
ERD will have the responsibility for implementation of the EMMP, which is summarized&#13;
in the following sections, and for supervision of the resettlement program.&#13;
4.          During construction, it is proposed that ERD staff would act as inspectors&#13;
and advisors to the Supervising Construction Engineer (the Engineer) on environmental&#13;
matters. Their responsibilities would include:&#13;
I/    Research Institute of Water Resources Protection for the Yangtze (1994), Environmental hImpad&#13;
Assessment for Wotr Resources Projeci in Hunan and Hubel Provincs, April, p. 192.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -                        ANNEX 7&#13;
(a)   carrying out inspections and other supervisory activities related to the&#13;
environmental provisions contained in the contract specification for the main&#13;
civil works package, recording the results of the inspections, and advising&#13;
the Engineer of the results of the inspections;&#13;
(b)   advising the Engineer on the findings of environmental monitoring programs&#13;
and, where adverse impacts are being detected, making suggestions to the&#13;
Engineer on changes in work practices and procedures to reduce these&#13;
impacts, and, as required and on behalf of the Engineer, drafting directions&#13;
to the contractors to mitigate environmental impacts;&#13;
(c)   monitoring the environmental aspects of the operations of other contractors&#13;
to the project and, as required, advising the Engineer on improvements that&#13;
should be implemented;&#13;
(d)   assisting the Engineer with the review of environmental management&#13;
proposals made by contractors;&#13;
(e)   on behalf of the Engineer, liaising with relevant government agencies, such&#13;
as County and Provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus, on&#13;
environmental matters relevant to the project.&#13;
5.          During operation, it is envisaged that the ERD would concern itself&#13;
primarily with environmental management and protection of the reservoir and the&#13;
surrounding catchment. The scope of its work in this regard would be defined by the&#13;
results of various data collection and analytical activities that have been provided for under&#13;
the EMMP.&#13;
EMMP Sumlmary and Overall Cost Estimate&#13;
6.          EMMP Stummary. The EMMP encompasses management and control of&#13;
project development activities (i.e., reservoir construction and resettlement) and&#13;
preparation for long-term environmental monitoring and management during the operational&#13;
phase. The plan is divided into five parts:&#13;
*    PART A: establishment of the ERD, which specifies the equipment and&#13;
facilities that will be procured to support the operations of the Division and&#13;
also provides a general outline of the Divisions's responsibilities (see&#13;
Table 3);&#13;
*     PART B: enviromnental management of the reservoir construction&#13;
program, which specifies the management and inspection activities that will&#13;
be carried out to maintain environmental management standards during the&#13;
construction phase. Most inspection activities will be carried out by staff&#13;
of the ERD but some tasks will be contracted out to local institutions that&#13;
will work under the direction and report to the ERD (see Table 4);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -                         ANNEX 7&#13;
*     PART C:  environmental monitoring, surveys and studies, which&#13;
provides for environmental surveys to assess construction-phase impacts,&#13;
baseline surveys to establish the basis for evaluating long-tenn operational&#13;
impacts and various technical studies to provide a basis for long-term&#13;
management of the reservoir to prevent environmental degradation due to&#13;
developments in the catchment area (see Tables 2 and 5);&#13;
*     PART  D:   environmental monitoring and management of the&#13;
resettlement program, which provides for monitoring, supervision and the&#13;
provision of environmental management advice to minimize impacts of the&#13;
resettlement program (see Tables 6 and 7); and&#13;
*     PART E: technical assistance, training and visits, which provides an&#13;
interface between the Institute of Water Resources Protection of the Yangtze&#13;
River Commission, which undertook the environmental studies and&#13;
developed the EMMP, and staff of the ERD, technical training of ERD staff&#13;
including visits to comparable developments elsewhere in China that already&#13;
have EMMPs in operation, and overseas visits to study river basin&#13;
management strategies applied by comparable institutions.&#13;
7.          Summary of Estimated EMMP Costs.  The costs associated with&#13;
environmental monitoring and management have been divided into three categories:&#13;
(a)   costs that will be directly incurred by ERD, other than staff salaries and&#13;
routine operating costs, and will require a budget allocation.  The&#13;
expenditures are almost exclusively for the procurement of contracted&#13;
services such as health inspections, water quality monitoring, etc., the size&#13;
of the service packages is generally small (&lt;Y 200,000) and most of the&#13;
services are highly specialized and in most cases, there are no alternative&#13;
suppliers. These services would be procured through Force Account. The&#13;
cost estimates also include several provisional suns to cover investments&#13;
and activities that would be determined on the basis of a mid-term progress&#13;
review and may or may not be expended;&#13;
(b)   costs that will be incurred by LHPC, and are covered in the other budget&#13;
estimates; and&#13;
(c)   costs that could be incurred by the construction contractors and will be&#13;
covered in their tender prices. These costs are only very rough estimates&#13;
and are included solely for the purposes of estimating the total financial&#13;
resources that could be applied to environmental management.&#13;
8.          The total of the three types of costs approximates the total investment that&#13;
will be required for environmental monitoring and management. Table 1 contains the&#13;
overall cost summary. The total direct cost to LHPC is budgeted to be Y 12,140,000, of&#13;
which Y 4,410,000 is budgeted to be expended through ERD. Of the latter, approximately&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -                        ANNEX 7&#13;
Y 1,540,000 is accounted for by provisional allowances for expenditures that might be&#13;
incurred, depending on experience as the project proceeds.&#13;
Part II: Environmental Management Plan for Four Lakes Development&#13;
Management Arrangements&#13;
9.          The EMMP for the proposed Four Lakes development consists of a&#13;
schistosomiasis control program, an extension program on agrochemical handling and&#13;
management; and, a water quality investigation program to monitor and analyze water&#13;
pollution sources in the Four Lakes area and make recommendations to the County and&#13;
Provincial governments on strategies to control the deteriorating water quality situation in&#13;
the area.&#13;
10.         Due to the limited scope of the EMMP, it is not proposed to establish a&#13;
special environmental unit to manage the program. Instead, it is proposed that the program&#13;
will be managed and organized by the Research Institute for Water Resources Protection&#13;
for the Yangtze (RIWRPY).&#13;
Scope and Costs of the Program&#13;
11.         Disease Control Program. The scope of work will include: education of&#13;
contractors and workers on schistosomiasis control procedures; medical checks of&#13;
construction workers and issuing of health cards; periodic follow-up worker health checks;&#13;
survey of oncomelia breeding areas and assistance in spoil disposal planning (to bury&#13;
breeding areas where possible); and the provision of other health care advice as required.&#13;
12.         This work would be carried out by the County hospitals, the County&#13;
Epidemic Prevention Stations and the Jingzhou Research Institute of Anti-Schistosomiasis,&#13;
organized and coordinated by RJWRPY. The estimated total cost of the program is&#13;
Y 500,000 over five years.&#13;
13.         Agrochemical Extension Program. The project will result in intensified&#13;
agricultural development in the area, which will be accompanied by increased usage of&#13;
agrochemicals including pesticides/herbicides and fertilizers. The extension program will&#13;
be designed to inform farmers on the safe handling, storage and application of these&#13;
chemicals by way of booklets, posters, radio broadcasts and presentations. The work will&#13;
be carried out by the County Bureaus of Agriculture and the estimated cost is Y 200,000.&#13;
14.         Water Quality Monitoring and Pollution Study.  Although the EIA&#13;
concluded that the Four Lakes development in itself would not have a significant adverse&#13;
environmental impact, it represents further intensification of land use in an area that is&#13;
already subject to significant water quality pressures due to agriculture, industrial and&#13;
urban developments. The proposed study is intended to identify the main sources of&#13;
pollution, estimate existing pollution loadings and destinations, assess the state of the&#13;
aquatic environment in the Four Lakes area, make projections of potential future pollution&#13;
&#13;

loadings and water quality and prepare a water quality control strategy for consideration&#13;
by both County and Provincial governments. The study would be based on existing data,&#13;
supplemented by additional water quality and pollutant discharge monitoring as required.&#13;
15.        It is proposed that the work would be carried out jointly by RPWRPY, local&#13;
County Environmental Monitoring Stations and the Hubei Province Environmental&#13;
Monitoring Center, with overaU project management being the responsibility of RIWRPY.&#13;
The estimated cost of the study is Y500,C000 and a period of five years has been allowed&#13;
for its completion, to allow adequate time for supplementary monitoring.&#13;
B. RESJrnEMENT-JIANGYA RESERVOIR AND DAM&#13;
Introduction&#13;
16.         The Jiangya Dam subproject will affect a total of 15,783 people. Of these,&#13;
3,196 people will be partiaUy affected. They will lose their agricultural land but not their&#13;
house, and wiU require economic rehabilitation. The majority, or about 12,587 people,&#13;
will be physicaUy displaced-567 people for the dam and 12,020 people for the reservoir.&#13;
It is estimated that the population of those to be physicaUy relocated wiUl increase,&#13;
primarily due to population growth, to about 13,761 people by the time resettlement is&#13;
completed in 1997.&#13;
17.         This subproject wil affect nine townships in three counties, that is, Cili and&#13;
Shanzhi counties in Hunan Province and Hefeng county in Hubei Province. The affected&#13;
area is largely agricultural, with about 90 percent of the population registered as&#13;
agricultural. The average size of agricultural households is 3.8 persons, with a labor force&#13;
ratio of about 50 percent. Education levels in the area are relatively low, with less than&#13;
1 percent of the population having obtained senior middle school or higher level of&#13;
education; about 42 percent of the population has primary school level education.&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and Schedule&#13;
18.         A resettlement action plan-'Comprehensive Resettlement Plan for the&#13;
Jiangya Reservoir of Hunan Province' (July 1994)-has been prepared. The plan&#13;
covers both the 12,600 people requiring physical resettlement, as well as the 3,200 that&#13;
are to be economically rehabilitated. The plan divides the resettlement program into&#13;
phases as per the project's construction program. The initial phase involves&#13;
resettlement of 567 people at the dam site and has been completed. The subsequent&#13;
phases involve resettlement in the reservoir area and are tied to the three stages of darn&#13;
construction and reservoir inundation. In September 1994, the construction schedule&#13;
was altered to allow more time for the first phase of reservoir resettlement. The&#13;
revised phasing for reallocation of people in the dam and reservoir areas (see Table Al&#13;
below and Chart 6) requires that the people be moved over a period of three years.&#13;
19.         The first phase of resettlement is associated with the construction of the&#13;
Coffer Dam. It will involve resettlement of about 4,000 people living below&#13;
&#13;

now be constructed in two stages to reduce the number of people to be resettled during&#13;
the first season.2/ This will not, however, affect the overall dam or construction&#13;
schedule. The first stage will involve building the Coffer Dam up to a height of 138 m&#13;
and resettlement of 421 people residing below that level. In the second stage, the&#13;
Coffer Dam will be raised to a final height of 158 m and about 3,574 people residing&#13;
below El. 160 m will be resettled.&#13;
Living Standards and Income Baseline&#13;
20.          Local authorities have conducted a full census of affected population in&#13;
the project area. In addition, detailed household-level socioeconomic surveys have also&#13;
been conducted for about 1,700 agricultural households.&#13;
(a)    Household Incomes. Govemment statistics indicate average annual&#13;
gross incomes of Y 1,226 in the reservoir area. Experience suggests,&#13;
however, that official statistics often tend to underestimate income levels&#13;
and should, therefore, be used only as reference points rather than as&#13;
firm statistics. The average per capita land holding in the reservoir area&#13;
is 1.18 mu or 0.08 acres, and that of the nine townships as a whole is&#13;
about 1.11 mu. One of the key findings of the household level&#13;
socioeconomic surveys is that agriculture accounts for only 25 percent of&#13;
the gross household incomes, grain production being primarily for&#13;
domestic consumption. About 30 percent of the household income is&#13;
from "sideline activities" such as animal husbandry, forestry, food&#13;
processing, and small-scale trading/vending. Labor wages for temporary&#13;

1994. Prepared by the Hunan Water Resources Project Management Office, this document serves&#13;
as a revision to the Resettlement Action Plan since it revises the resettlement schedule for the first&#13;
two phases of reservoir resettlement.&#13;

or contract work account for the majority of the household income, that&#13;
is, about 45 percent.&#13;
(b)   Living Standards. The household-level surveys include baseline data on&#13;
indicators such as: (a) house area, and quality and materials of&#13;
construction; (b) access to water supply and electricity; and (c) household&#13;
assets. These indicators will be monitored by an independent monitoring&#13;
agency (WUHEE) to ascertain changes in living standards over time.&#13;
Resettlement Strategy&#13;
21.         The strategy involves: (a) resettlement of about 11,230 agricultural&#13;
resettlers on land at higher elevations, above the final reservoir level of 236 m;&#13;
(b) resettlement of 2,640 agricultural people in the suburbs of Cili town due to lack of&#13;
arable land near the original location; (c) resettlement of 1,125 people, from the six&#13;
affected market towns to the new sites for the towns; and (d) allowing people, if they&#13;
prefer, to move to other areas to live with relatives.&#13;
22.         The following actions would be taken to implement the above strategy:&#13;
(a)   Development of Resettlement Sites, Housing and Infrastructure&#13;
Reconstruction. This program involves development and construction of&#13;
29 village sites and six market towns. The original floor space of the&#13;
affected housing, that is, 425,000 m2, will be rebuilt by the resettlers&#13;
from their compensation monies. The local government and resettlement&#13;
offices will be responsible for completing land development activities and&#13;
providing infrastructure at the resettlement sites prior to the moving date.&#13;
Infrastructure in market towns will include provision of water supply,&#13;
drainage, electricity and, if necessary, sanitation.&#13;
(b)   Reestablishment of Livelihood. A majority of the resettlers (75 percent)&#13;
will be provided with farmland at higher elevation, primarily for&#13;
cultivation of fruits, tea and Chinese medicinal herbs. About 19 percent&#13;
of the resettlers will be supported by 1,000 new jobs that will be created&#13;
through investment of resettlement funds in village and township&#13;
enterprises. Of the remaining 6 percent, 3 percent of the resettlers will&#13;
be involved in aquaculture, and another 3 percent will continue with&#13;
grain farming. The task of reestablishment of resettlers' livelihoods will&#13;
involve development of about 34,000 mu of land and 16 enterprises.&#13;
Resettlement Cost Estimates&#13;
23.         The base cost for the resettlement program is Y 207.75 million, in 1992&#13;
prices (see Table A2). The per capita base cost is about Y 12,000 or $1,400 for the&#13;
program as a whole, including investment for infrastructure development and&#13;
relocation. The cash compensation, for housing and loss of assets, to be paid directly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -                       ANNEX 7&#13;
to the resettlers is estimated at about Y 9,000 per capita; the average household&#13;
compensation is estimated at about Y 35,000, of which Y 15,000-24,000 is likely to be&#13;
spent on housing. Adjusting the base price for inflation and physical contingencies,&#13;
final resettlement costs are estimated at about Y 307 million.&#13;

Resettlement Organization and Management&#13;
24.        LHPC, the project owner, will supervise and coordinate supervision&#13;
resettlement activities. LHPC has contracted WUHEE to provide technical support and&#13;
to provide independent monitoring and evaluation of the program. It has also extended&#13;
the contract of the Hunan Hydro Design Institute (HHDI)-the lead architects of the&#13;
resettlement plan-to facilitate a smooth transition to the implementation phase and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 174 -                        ANNEX.7&#13;
ensure appropriate input from the designers. In addition, LHPC will be advised by a&#13;
technical panel that includes resettlement and environmental experts. MWRs&#13;
resettlement office has the authority to ensure that resettlement guidelines and laws are&#13;
adequately followed. MWR can also exercise indirect control on disbursements of&#13;
resettlement funds from the Ministry of Finance to the provinces.&#13;
25.         The provincial governments of Hunan and Hubei have the ultimate&#13;
authority as well as responsibility for the management and implementation of the&#13;
resettlement program. At the provincial level, a separate department has been created&#13;
in the Provincial Resettlement Office for the Jiangya project. Resettlement offices have&#13;
been established at the county and township levels. There are three county&#13;
resettlement offices and seven township offices that are in the process of being&#13;
strengthened both through additional recruitment and through training. Finally, the&#13;
responsibility for coordinating resettlement activities between the various resettlement&#13;
offices and line departments lies with the resettlement leading groups at the provincial,&#13;
municipal, and county levels.&#13;
Recent Resettlement Experience&#13;
26.         Project authorities have gained some resettlement experience under the&#13;
Tieshan irrigation subproject (853 people) and the Liuduzhai irrigation subproject (651&#13;
people). These resettlement programs have been successful in providing good-quality&#13;
replacement housing and agricultural land to maintain incomes of resettlers. In&#13;
addition, 567 people have already been resettled at the dam site. The resettlers have&#13;
constructed superior-quality housing, often better than their original house. Investment&#13;
in and development of enterprises has, however, lagged behind. This is because&#13;
resettlers have access to construction jobs in the project as well as job opportunities in&#13;
the service industry that has sprung up around the project. These projects have&#13;
provided project authorities with some insights into the resettlement process. However,&#13;
they cannot be considered as prototypes or as representative of the resettlement required&#13;
in the reservoir area, particularly, because of the magnitude of people involved.&#13;

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
Prices&#13;
1.          At present, the prices of agricultural products in the project area, except&#13;
for cotton and tobacco, are free-market prices or coexist with free-market prices. State&#13;
procurement prices consist of a ceiling and a floor-guaranted price. In general, they&#13;
are close to free-market prices after several adjustments, except for rice. All direct&#13;
government subsidies have been eliminated.&#13;
2.          In Hubei and Hunan, output prices have risen steadily for the past several&#13;
years. The crops' purchasing price index in 1993 rose 14.5 percent from 1992, includ-&#13;
ing a grain price rise of 16.8 percent, cash crops of 13.6 percent, livestock products of&#13;
17.4 percent, and other crops of 5.1 percent. The official guaranteed price in 1994&#13;
increased 25 percent from 1993 for grain (Y 0.8/kg to Y 1.0/kg), 21.1 percent for&#13;
cotton (Y 6.6/kg to Y 8/kg), and 57 percent for rapeseed (Y 1.4/kg to Y 2.2/kg). The&#13;
unit price for vegetables, fruits, meat, and aquatic products have increased also. These&#13;
increases have brought official prices of wheat, maize, and oilseeds closer to local,&#13;
open-market prices.&#13;
3.          Cotton and tobacco are the only commodities under the project that are&#13;
still subject to state contract purchase at prices announced annually by the provincial&#13;
government. Farmers required to produce them according to production quotas or&#13;
contracts.&#13;
4.          Farmers will be able to sell their incremental project output at local&#13;
market prices (except cotton and tobacco). It is expected that most of the incremental&#13;
crop and livestock production of the project would be consumed in the project areas or&#13;
in other domestic markets. Project farmers will also be able to buy sufficient quantities&#13;
of fertilizer, agrochemicals and other farm inputs at free-market prices, although in&#13;
general prices for those items have risen faster than for grain prices. Input prices rose&#13;
from 1993 to 1994 by 29 percent for urea, 14 percent for phosphate fertilizer, and 30&#13;
percent for agricultural chemicals.&#13;
5.          Prices Used in Analysis. Input and output prices used in crop budgets&#13;
for financial analysis of the project components are either 1994 average free-market&#13;
prices or official prices, based on data from project authorities (Table 1). For the&#13;
economic analysis, World Bank commodity price projections have been used to calcu-&#13;
late the farm-gate value of rice, wheat, maize, soybean, cotton, timber, urea, DAP, and&#13;
potassium chloride, with appropriate adjustments for nutrient content, domestic, and&#13;
intemational transport and handling costs. The values for most other farm inputs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204 -                       ANNEX 10&#13;
outputs have been considered equivalent to the financial price or adjusted by the stan-&#13;
dard conversion factor (see para. 14).&#13;
Financial Analysis&#13;
6.          Substantial employment, income enhancement and poverty alleviation will&#13;
accrue from increased production of crops, forestry, livestock, and aquaculture prod-&#13;
ucts. The production will be from irrigation and drainage subprojects, and nonwater&#13;
subprojects. Further benefits will accrue from flood control and power generation of&#13;
Jiangya Dam, and from increased flood protection and warning time on the middle&#13;
Yangtze River.&#13;
7.          Financial analyses have been carried out for the principal components&#13;
based on detailed crop budgets prepared for the annual and perennial crops, reflecting&#13;
representative scenarios in all components and subprojects. Selected crop budget&#13;
models are attached in Table 2. In analyzing output by crop, investment and produc-&#13;
tion costs are valued at the average annual market price or official price in 1994, and&#13;
use conservative assumptions on yields and commodity prices. Given the price and cost&#13;
structures in each subproject area, as well as the objective of the project, rates of return&#13;
(ERRs) for all components are acceptable. The FRRs on individual components ranged&#13;
from 12.4 (Table 3), protection forestry to 37.7 percent (aquaculture, turtle hatcheries).&#13;
Irrigation and drainage components ranged from 14.7 (Liuduzhai in Hunan) to 23.5&#13;
percent (Yindan in Hubei). The forestry subproject ERR is 22.8 percent; within each&#13;
component, it ranged from 12.4 to 25.3 percent with different kind of trees: the timber&#13;
is 19.1 percent, fruit is 25.3 percent, and the lowest rate, 12.4 percent, occurs for&#13;
plantings of protection forestry that does not always pay in the short run, although trees&#13;
are a critical element in the comprehensive conservation of soil and water. The grass-&#13;
land and livestock components are 16 percent for uplands and about 18 percent for&#13;
lowlands. The aquaculture subproject is 30.2 percent, including 37 percent for finger-&#13;
ling ponds, 17.1 percent for intensive fishponds, 37 percent for the new turtle hatchery&#13;
and larva turtle ponds, 22 percent for adult turtle ponds, 19.3 percent for new finger-&#13;
ling ponds, and 27.9 percent for the extensive lake component.&#13;
Agricultural Benefits&#13;
8.         Incremental Production. The major benefits of the project derive from&#13;
incremental agricultural production and rural incomes. The irrigation and drainage&#13;
components will provide incremental field crop production of 2.6 million tons of grain,&#13;
and 0.21 million tons of cash crops. This increment is valued, net of on-farm labor&#13;
costs, at $203 million annually. Incremental fruit production of 40,881 tons is valued&#13;
at $7.93 million, while 0.29 million m3 of incremental timber production is valued at&#13;
$8.87 million, 42,053 additional head of cattle at $4.51 million, and 21,031 additional&#13;
tons of aquatic products at $6.2 million. In total, these components would generate an&#13;
incremental value of $231 million annually.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 205 -                       ANNEX 10&#13;
9.         Income and Poverty Alleviation. The farm model analysis shows a&#13;
substantial increase in farmer income with improvements in irrigation and drainage,&#13;
land utilization, crop pattern, and production. Several items have been taken into&#13;
account to assess the impact on typical household income, such as: various incremental&#13;
taxes (agricultural tax, special product tax and fee, etc.); the project loan repayment,&#13;
which includes farmer labor contribution requirement allocated to each household (total-&#13;
ing about 15 percent of the project cost); up to 10 percent of the annual net family&#13;
income used to repay the bank loan starting six years after full development; and an&#13;
incremental water charge that covers the full operation and maintenance fee for the new&#13;
and rehabilitated irrigation and drainage system. The standard charge for these items in&#13;
each subproject area is presented in the typical household farm model (Table 5).&#13;
10.         Many farm households were investigated in the project area to represent&#13;
typical beneficiary families. The typical farm households are selected in every subproj-&#13;
ect area based on the three current income levels (high, middle, and low). The main&#13;
category in typical household farm models includes detailed income, and expenditures&#13;
for different income levels. The average growth rate of household income at year 8&#13;
will be 55.6 percent, with an annual average growth rate of 5.7 percent (Table 4).&#13;
11.        The net income of farm families who adopt improved or new technolo-&#13;
gies under the project would increase substantially. Farm models have indicated that in&#13;
Hubei the project would increase farm household average income in irrigated and drain-&#13;
aged areas about 50 percent, from Y 1,153 to Y 1,414 in Dongfeng; Y 1,411 to Y&#13;
1,636 in Zhanghe; and Y 1,248 to Y 1,583 in Wenxia. However, the project would&#13;
double or triple the incomes of adoptees in many villages where comprehensive mea-&#13;
sures were implemented (in the Sihu and Yindan areas).&#13;
12.        In addition, the project would directly help to alleviate poverty in the&#13;
Hunan project area, especially for Luduzhai subproject area, which is classified by the&#13;
government as among the poorest areas in China. Ten percent of households are cur-&#13;
rently at the low-income level (below Y 300), 65 percent at the middle-income level (Y&#13;
300-500), and 12 to 13 percent of households at the high-income level (above Y 500).&#13;
The per capita income in Tieshan is about Y 436. The project would increase farm&#13;
income for the typical household in Hunan about 57 percent, from Y 462 to Y 772 in&#13;
Tieshan irrigation area, and Y 439 to Y 646 in Liuduzhai area.&#13;
13.        Employment. Employment opportunities generated by the project would&#13;
help reduce seasonal underemployment among the rural labor force in and around proj-&#13;
ect areas. At full development, average incremental labor requirements for farming&#13;
activities in crops, forestry, aquatic products, grasslands and livestock production would&#13;
average 94.52 million person-days, 1.37 million person-days, 0.81 million person-days,&#13;
and 1.11 million person-days per year, respectively, equivalent to a total of 0.33 mil-&#13;
lion new jobs. In each subproject area, land construction and preparation would require&#13;
additional hired labor, which is amply available from the underemployed labor pool,&#13;
throughout the year in each province.&#13;

- 206 -                        ANNEX 10&#13;
Economic and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
14.         Assumptions. Economic analysis has been carried out for the all sub-&#13;
projects (irrigation and drainage, soil improvement, forestry, grassland, aquaculture&#13;
development, Jiangya Dam and FFWS), and for the project as a whole. World Bank&#13;
price projections or export pnces actually realized in China were taken to estimate&#13;
farm-gate prices in 1994 constant terms for traded inputs and outputs (Table 6). The&#13;
standard conversion factor of 0.97 is applied to all nontraded items (conversion factors&#13;
for investment cost items are listed in Table 7). All economic values were converted to&#13;
local currency at the prevailing official exchange rate of Y 8.7 to $1.0, a discount rate&#13;
of 12 percent was used, which is considered to approximate the opportunity cost of&#13;
capital in China. All project costs, including project investment and production costs,&#13;
working capital, and physical contingencies have been taken into account in estimating&#13;
the economic costs of the project, but price contingencies, interest, and taxes were&#13;
omitted.&#13;
15.         Agriculture. Based on the above assumptions and comparing costs and&#13;
benefits over a period of 20 years, the economic rates of return (ERRs) for selected&#13;
agricultural components range between 17.6 percent (for Liuduzhai imgation) to&#13;
34.5 percent (for aquaculture), depending on the assumed cropping pattern, the size of&#13;
the irrigated and drainage area, and the investment costs. The overall project ERRs&#13;
for Hubei and Hunan subproject area are 25.7 and 18.3 percent with a net present value&#13;
of about Y 1,257 and Y 972 million, Table 8.&#13;
16.         Sensitivity analysis on the ERRs for each of the project irrigated areas&#13;
and nonwater components has been carried out with switching values to identify before&#13;
the project becomes economically nonviable and how far costs can rise or benefits can&#13;
fall. Table 8 shows that the overall project is not rendered unprofitable by significant&#13;
changes in cost or benefits: benefits will need to be 30 percent lower than estimated or&#13;
incremental costs 40 percent higher before the ERR will fall to 12 percent. The sensi-&#13;
tivity analysis indicates, even though the proportion of protection forestry investment is&#13;
larger and benefits are less than in other components, forestry as a subproject is satis-&#13;
factory as well. The detailed analysis can be found in the project files.&#13;
17.         Jiangya Multipurpose Dam. The control of floods and supply of power&#13;
and energy to the Hunan power grid are the primary benefits of the Jiangya component.&#13;
Among other Jiangya benefits are improved water supply for domestic use and irriga-&#13;
tion (although its distribution system is not covered by the project and would be con-&#13;
structed later); and improved river transportation for navigation and tourism. These&#13;
benefits are small in relation to the total project benefits and not quantified here.&#13;
18.         Flood Control. The flood-control storage capacity of Jiangya Dam is&#13;
about 0.74 billion m3, enough to raise the flood security standard of the Western&#13;
Dongting Lake Area from the present flood return period of 1 in 4 years to 1 in 17&#13;
years, and for the section between the dam site and Sanjiangkou up to a 20-year return&#13;
&#13;

period flood.l/ Thus, the dangers of normally occurring floods can be avoided, and&#13;
the average peak water level and losses caused by large floods can be reduced. Analy-&#13;
sis of historic floods over 40 years and the 11 floods since 1935 that caused major&#13;
damage indicates that, with Jiangya Dam, flooding of polder areas could have been&#13;
avoided for 9 of the 11 floods, flood diversions would not have been required, and&#13;
2,950 ha of inundated farmland would be saved each year, except for years of abnormal&#13;
flooding from the Yangtze River (in 1935 and 1954). For floods with peak discharges&#13;
of the 20-year flood level, flooding of polder areas could be eliminated or reduced by&#13;
about 85 percent (depending on flood volume), and about 9,330 ha of inundated farm-&#13;
land resulting from flood diversion can be saved. For the 50-year flood, the safety of&#13;
key areas can be guaranteed by combining Jiangya Dam project with flood detention&#13;
and flood storage areas. Flood diversion can be decreased by 642 million m3 and&#13;
12,460 ha of inundated farmland can be protected.&#13;
19.        Methodology and Assumptions. Flood control benefits are calculated as&#13;
the reduction in expected average annual flood damage due to operation of Jiangya&#13;
dam. Underlying estimates of expected average annual damages with and without the&#13;
project were made separately for the polder area (below Shimen County) and the river&#13;
valley area (above Shimen County), and obtained by estimating damage that major&#13;
historical floods would cause under the present conditions. Recorded losses of 11&#13;
major floods since 1935 were adjusted to derive their equivalent damages under current&#13;
conditions.&#13;
20.         For the pokder area, extra volumes of flood water under various flood&#13;
frequencies were first calculated. The corresponding polder area required to absorb the&#13;
flood, i.e., the polder area to be inundated, was then derived based on an assumed&#13;
water depth of 2 to 5 m. Average unit flood damage based on the survey of four&#13;
typical polder areas (Table 9) was multiplied by area to derive the total average annual&#13;
flood damages. In addition, the reduction of flood control cost with the project is taken&#13;
into account for the benefit analysis, indicating a flood control and emergency handling&#13;
cost of Y 6.8 million can be saved annually. For the nlver valley area, due to the sharp&#13;
increase of water level during flooding, the value of dikes is limited. Therefore, the&#13;
stage-damage relationship was established to estimate the damage under various flood&#13;
frequencies.&#13;
21.         Flood damages include lost agricultural and industrial production,&#13;
personal and public property, etc. This was investigated by a team from Hunan and&#13;
Yangtze Water Resources Commission in the flood zone of Hunan and Hubei at the&#13;
beginning of 1992. They applied a sampling and synthesizing method. The unit of&#13;
flood damage per ha was calculated comprehensively based on this investigational data,&#13;
assuming damage increases at the rate of 4 percent per year to reflect the impact of&#13;
economic growth. An inflation rate of 30 percent was used to adjust the recorded&#13;
losses in 1992 to 1994 prices.&#13;
1/    A 20-year flood is the largest level of flood with a 0.05 probaility of occuring in any single year.&#13;

22.        Flood Control Benefit. Based on the assumptions described above, the&#13;
expected annual flood control benefits under the current conditions calculated in 1994&#13;
constant prices were Y 122.51 million. The benefits were assumed to increase by&#13;
4 percent annually for the first 10 years of the project, and 3 percent annually&#13;
thereafter, to reflect future economic development. Using the method of separable&#13;
costs/remaining benefits to allocate common costs of the dam, the ERR for the flood&#13;
control component is 22 percent, and the total flood control benefits, discounted at&#13;
12 perct to the beginning of 1995, are Y 436 million (Table 10).&#13;
23.        Power Generation. The average installed capacity and average power&#13;
generation per capita in Hunan province is only 60 percent of the corresponding value&#13;
for all China. During the 1980s, the growth rate of power generation capacity and&#13;
energy generation developed relatively slowly, 4.1 percent and 4.5 percent,&#13;
respectively, in 1985. However, the annual economic growth rate is at 10.47 percent,&#13;
resulting in a serious shortage of electricity in the province. Due to power shortages,&#13;
20 percent of industrial capability cannot be used; the chemical and metallurgical&#13;
enterprises cease production 2 to 4 months annually, and farmland cannot be irrigated&#13;
or drained. The total shortage of power was 1,772 million kWh in 1989, with loss of&#13;
production at about Y 5,446 million; and 1,500 million kWh in 1990, with loss of&#13;
production of about Y 4,506 million, and 1,000 MW in 1992.&#13;
24.         Load forecasting, based on the differing assumptions about economic&#13;
growth and power demand for Hunan Power Grid, has been derived by the Beijing&#13;
Economic Research Institute (BERI). The Jiangya Dam has a normal reservoir storage&#13;
water level of 236 e3, corresponding to total regulating reservoir volume 1,165 million&#13;
ml3, of which 740 million i3 are for flood control and other for power generation. The&#13;
installed capacity of Jiangya hydropower plant is 300 MW. The plant would generate&#13;
756 GWh per year on average. Additional power generation of 58 million kWh&#13;
represents the increased energy output of the downstream stages due to Jiangya Dam,&#13;
half of which is taken into account by the project economic analysis (29 million GWh).&#13;
After the dam is in operation, it will bear a peak load of 390 GWh and a middle load&#13;
of 395 GWh in the Hunan power grid.&#13;
25.        Methodology and Assumptions. Power benefits from Jiangya are&#13;
calculated by the Electric System Planning Model of BERI (a multiregional, integrated&#13;
generating system expansion optimization model), which developed the least-cost&#13;
expansion plans for the Hunan Power Grid with and without Jiangya. The present&#13;
value of all capital and operating costs, except the Jiangya cost, is then calculated for&#13;
each expansion scenario. The replacement for Jiangya in the alternative expansion plan&#13;
is thermal capacity. Thermal candidates included in the planning studies were 300 MW&#13;
and 600 MW coal-fired plants; 100 MW distillate-fired, combined-cycle plants; and 10&#13;
MW distillate-fired gas turbines. Characteristics of the thermal expansion altematives&#13;
used in the analysis are presented in the following table:&#13;

26.         Based on these assumptions, the power tariff in the proposed project is&#13;
Y 0.44/kWh. Since local manufacturers are capable of meeting only 70 percent of the&#13;
demand for new generating capacity, consumers are willing to pay at least this&#13;
alternative cost. Power from all new thermal power plants in China is priced to&#13;
achieve loan repayment (assuming fully debt-financed) over a 10-year period. Resulting&#13;
prices to the grid are substantially above long-run marginal cost. All incremental&#13;
consumption beyond 1983 levels is charged at this "new" price so there is ample&#13;
evidence to demonstrate that consumers' willingness to pay is well above long-run&#13;
marginal cost, based on thermal generation. The alternative cost used here, therefore,&#13;
provides a lower-bound estimate of the power supply benefits from the Jiangya&#13;
hydropower component.&#13;
27.         Cost Allocation. Common costs of the Jiangya component (dam, flood&#13;
handling, resettlement, boatlift facilities, and environmental treatment) are allocated to&#13;
power and flood control using the "separable costs/remaining benefits" methodology.&#13;
This results in 49.1 percent of common costs allocated to power and 50.9 percent&#13;
allocated to flood control.&#13;
28.         All assumptions and conversion factors used in calculation were&#13;
consistent throughout the economic analysis of the all components. Import parity price&#13;
was used for capital costs of thermal generation. Coal for future, large power plants in&#13;
Hunan is likely to come from Shanxi. The shadow price used for coal was based on&#13;
the export price at Qinhuangdao seaport ($35 per ton at 6,000 kcallkg). Transportation&#13;
costs between Shanxi mine-mouth and Qinhuangdao were deducted, yielding a mine-&#13;
mouth, export-parity price. Rail transport costs between the mine-mouth and Hunan&#13;
were then added to obtain the shadow price in Hunan.&#13;

29.         Power Generation Benefit. The economic benefits of power generation&#13;
of Jiangya Dam come from contribution to the total cost saving in Hunan power&#13;
system. The economic benefits of Jlangya is composed of two parts: capacity benefit&#13;
from investment and fixed O&amp;M cost of alternative candidates, and energy generation&#13;
benefit from the alternative cost replacing energy generation of Jiangya. Economic&#13;
value of this power is Y 0.44/kWh. Using the method of separable costs/remaining&#13;
benefits to allocate common costs, ERR for the power component is about 16 percent&#13;
and total net present value of power generation, discounted at 12 percent to the&#13;
begnning of 1995, is Y 319 million (Table 11).&#13;
30.         ERR and Sensitivity Ansalysis. The proposed Jlangya subproject would&#13;
yield an estimated ERR of about 19 percent for the base-case scenario. Its NPV, at a&#13;
12-percent discount rate, is Y 764 million C(able 12). Assuming the opportumity cost&#13;
of capital is 12 percent, switching value calculations indicate that the Jiangya&#13;
multipurpose dam benefits would have to be reduced by 40 percent to reduce the ERR&#13;
of the whole subproject to 12 percent. Similarly, to reduce the EIRR to 12 percent, the&#13;
total cost for the whole subproject would have to increase 34 percent. Switching value&#13;
calculations indicate that none of the liklly cases would reduce the ERR of the whole&#13;
subproject to 12 percent (rable 13).&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Yangtze Basin Water Resources
            Project will raise agricultural production and incomes;
            reduce the risk and impact of floods; introduce a more
            sustainable and cost-effective system of operation and
            maintenance of irrigation and drainage schemes; and promote
            institutional reform and strengthening and improve planning
            and environmental monitoring in the water sector. Key
            institutional development objectives will be to introduce
            comprehensive river basin management, and self-financing
            irrigation and drainage districts based on farmer
            participation. This will promote cost recovery,
            decentralization of services delivery, and participation by
            users which are key elements of Government and Bank water
            resources policy. The project will be the first Bank Group
            supported comprehensive water resources operation in China.
