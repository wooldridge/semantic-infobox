&amp;#12;BOX 1.1â&#128;&#131; Common Features of PIM in Donor-Dependent Countries&#13;
&#13;
Public investment management (PIM) systems in donor-dependent settings tend to exhibit the&#13;
following distinctive features:&#13;
Investment guidance, project development and preliminary screening: government strategy docu-&#13;
ments, such as a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), tend to be directed towards the donors,&#13;
rather than covering both external and domestic investment in an integrated and coherent manner.&#13;
They are at a level of generality that limits the extent to which they can provide a basis for prelimi-&#13;
nary screening of projects, and are often not supported by effective sector strategies.&#13;
Formal project appraisal: there is a reliance on donors to conduct appraisal, with a serious lack of&#13;
appraisal capacity within government; and a lack of guidance on defining the project preparation&#13;
process and on how to appraise domestically-financed projects and PPPs. Donor capacity-building&#13;
on appraisal tends to be agency-specific, with little or no domestic training capacity.&#13;
Independent review of appraisal: reflecting reliance on donors, there is a lack of capacity for inde-&#13;
pendent review, either of donor projects or domestically-financed projects.&#13;
Project selection and budgeting: the budget is divided into a recurrent and a development budget,&#13;
withÂ weak integration between the two and substantial off-budget aid. The use of Public Investment&#13;
Programs (PIPs) remains quite common, but these can be poorly connected to fiscal policy and the&#13;
budget. In practice, a PIP tends to be more a coordination tool than a tool to manage the project port-&#13;
folio strategically or to help enforce review of individual project proposals before they can be consid-&#13;
ered for budget funding. Agreement by a donor to finance a project is tantamount to the project being&#13;
included in the budgetâ&#128;&#148;subject to basic screening for consistency with a PRSP (which is not difficult&#13;
given their generality) and any required counterpart financing being affordable.&#13;
Project implementation: unpredictability of donor funding (especially budget support) interrupts&#13;
project implementation due to lack of alternative financing. Weak project management capacity&#13;
induces donors to set up multiple Project Implementation Units (PIUs) within implementing&#13;
agencies that initially help to speed implementation and compliance with fiduciary standards,&#13;
but which cut across and negatively impact on in-line capacities and accounting and reporting&#13;
systems. Procurement is undertaken by PIUs or donors to donor standards rather than national&#13;
procurement standards.&#13;
Project adjustment: reliance on donors to trigger review of any projects that are off-track. No simi-&#13;
lar mechanism for domestically-financed projects.&#13;
Facility operation: formal hand-over procedures on completion of donor projects, but inadequate&#13;
asset registration systems; and inadequate funding for operations and maintenance, in part due to&#13;
weak integration of recurrent costs of donor projects in fiscal policy and budgets.&#13;
Basic completion review and evaluation: reliance on donors to undertake reviews and evaluations of&#13;
their projects. Otherwise, little or no systematic basic post-project review, let alone evaluation, and&#13;
little systematic use made of findings from donor evaluations to Â­ improve future project design and&#13;
implementation.&#13;

&amp;#12;  BOX 1.2â&#128;&#131; Product Market Concentration Analysisa&#13;
&#13;
  An analysis of product market concentration was conducted jointly between the World Bank and&#13;
  the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Haiti with the collaboration of a team of&#13;
  researchers from Harvard and Columbia Universities.&#13;
  The analysis was based on Herfindahl-Hirschman indices (HHI), calculated using customs im-&#13;
  port data based on the Harmonized Coding System (HS) disaggregated at a four-digit level. The&#13;
  HS is a multipurpose international product nomenclature developed by the World Customs&#13;
  Organization.&#13;
  The HHI is a commonly accepted measure of market concentration based on market share esti-&#13;
  mates for each firm in the market. It is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm com-&#13;
  peting in a market (showing the relative space they occupy in the specific market being analyzed),&#13;
  and then summing up the resulting numbers for the fifty largest firms (or overall firms if the indus-&#13;
  try counts fewer than fifty companies). The HHI is preferred to other concentration measures (such&#13;
  as concentration ratio) because it accounts for the heterogeneity in the size of the firms in the mar-&#13;
  ket, giving more weight to larger firms.&#13;
  The HHI can range from close to zero to 10,000. The closer a market is to being a monopoly the&#13;
  higher the HHI. If, for example, there was only one firm in an industry (a monopolist), that firm&#13;
  would have 100 percent market share, and the HHI would be equal to 10,000 (100^2). Conversely,&#13;
  ifÂ there were thousands of firms competing in an industry, each firm would have nearly 0 percent&#13;
  market share, and the HH index would be close to zero.&#13;
  For the purpose of this analysis, the concentration levels based on the Horizontal Merger&#13;
  Guidelines (U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission) were used. As such, three&#13;
  HHI levels help identify the characteristics of product market concentration:&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Unconcentrated Markets: HHI below 1,500.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Moderately Concentrated Markets: HHI between 1,500 and 2,500.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Highly Concentrated Markets: HHI above 2,500.&#13;

preliminary analysis over time of prices for&#13;

&amp;#12;  BOX 2.1â&#128;&#131; Gender Inequalities in Haiti&#13;
&#13;
  Women and girls in Haiti still face greater obstacles to attend school. Despite progress in school en-&#13;
  rollment among younger cohorts, adult women are still worse educated than adult men and are more&#13;
  likely to be illiterate. Adult men have, on average, two more years of education than women and are&#13;
  over 10 percentage points more likely to be literate. Early withdrawal from school can have lifelong&#13;
  consequences. Underage marriage and teen pregnancy, for instance, represent additional risks for&#13;
  girls who do not attend school: 17 percent of Haitian women are married in adolescence, compared&#13;
  with 2 percent of men, this number dropping among girls with higher education (Cicmil 2013).&#13;
  They deal with greater health challenges. Maternal mortality, at 380 deaths per 100,000 live births, is still&#13;
  five times higher than the regional average (WHO 2014)a, partly because a high percentage of birth de-&#13;
  liveries take place outside a health care facility (65 percent). Poor nutrition is a threat for both children&#13;
  and mothers: according to the MSPP, IHE, and ICF International (2013), 22 percent of children are&#13;
  stunted or too short for their age, while nearly half of women aged 15â&#128;&#147;49 have anemia. The prevalence&#13;
  of HIV/AIDS is higher among women (2.7 percent) than men (1.7 percent), reflecting both knowledge&#13;
  differentials among other factors: only 15 percent of young women have correct information on how to&#13;
  prevent sexual HIV transmission compared to 28 percent of young men (Boesten and Poku 2009).&#13;
  Women are significantly disadvantaged in the labor market. Holding constant several social and de-&#13;
  mographic characteristics, one finds that women are 20 percentage points more likely than men to&#13;
  be unemployed and, if working, 6 percentage points more likely to be in the informal sector. Wages&#13;
  among women are also 32 percent lower than wages among men. Over two-thirds of this difference&#13;
  is unexplained by observable characteristics, suggesting that discrimination could play a role.&#13;
  Gender-based violence is widespread. Gender-based violence is a chronic problem: according to the&#13;
  MSPP, IHE, and ICF International (2013), 13 percent of Haitian women have experienced sexual vio-&#13;
  lence, and 29 percent of women who have ever been married have experienced spousal violence,&#13;
  whether emotional, physical, or sexual. Vulnerability is particularly high among internally displaced&#13;
  people in camps and areas affected by the 2010 earthquake: a survey in 2011 indicated that 64 percent&#13;
  ofÂ interviewed pregnant adolescent girls had become pregnant after being raped (PotoFi 2012).&#13;
  Female participation in the public sphere is low. Only 4 percent of all parliamentary seats were occupied&#13;
  by women in the most recent legislature, placing Haiti well below the regional average of 26 percent and&#13;
  among the countries with the lowest rate (136th out of 142 countries). At the national level, as of April&#13;
  2014, 8 of 23 ministers and 3 of 20 secretaries of state were women.b At the local level, women account&#13;
  for only 12 percent of all mayors. The government has taken steps to expand womenâ&#128;&#153;s representation,&#13;
  including by creating the Gender Equality Office in Parliament and amending the Constitution to stip-&#13;
  ulate a quota of at least 30 percent women in all public offices, but enforcement is problematic.&#13;

&amp;#12;BOX 3.1â&#128;&#131; Petrocaribe and Haiti&#13;
&#13;
The Petrocaribe initiative, created in 2005, has 18 members.a The agreement aims to promote&#13;
cooperation among state energy operators, in terms of technology, energy policy, joint exploration,&#13;
refining, sales and investment in the energy sector. The most relevant aspect of the Petrocaribe&#13;
agreement is the stable supply of oil from Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela to other members,&#13;
at favorable financing conditions. Through the agreement, Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela&#13;
commits to providing oil to the members based on quotas established bilaterally at international&#13;
market prices. Haiti joined the initiative in March 2007 and started benefiting from the agreement&#13;
in October 2007, with a quota of 14 thousand barrels per day (b/d). However, only a fraction of the&#13;
bill needs to be paid in cash, the remaining is financed on concessional terms.&#13;

The sale of these oil products in the domestic market creates considerable resources for&#13;
the government. Since 2008, the Petrocaribe flows have amounted cumulatively to&#13;
25Â percent of GDP. An autonomous agency of the Ministry of Finance (the Bureau de&#13;
MonÃ©tisation du Programme dâ&#128;&#153;Aide au DÃ©veloppement, BMPAD) manages these resources&#13;
on behalf of the Haitian government. BMPAD plays an intermediary role between Haitian&#13;
fuel purchasers and the Venezuelan supplier.&#13;
Petrocaribe resources have been used to finance investment and social projects, as well as&#13;
support the electricity sector. Whenever the government decides that new projects will be&#13;
financed using these resources, it publishes a resolution listing these projects and the&#13;
amounts to be financed in the official gazette. Disbursements into the projects are re-&#13;
ported in BMPADâ&#128;&#153;s webpage on a regular basis. These projects suffer nevertheless from&#13;
the same shortcomings than the rest of the Public Investment Program, notably a lack of&#13;
proper assessment, prioritization and monitoring (see box 1.1). A recent audit of these in-&#13;
vestments by the CSCCA highlights serious shortcomings in the procurement and super-&#13;
vision of contracts, including over-priced infrastructure and abandoned projects.&#13;

&amp;#12;  BOX 4.1â&#128;&#131; Drivers of Conflict in Haitiâ&#128;&#148;An Empirical Analysisa&#13;
&#13;
  In order to understand better the role of various socio-economic factors in explaining the ebbs and&#13;
  flows of conflict across Haiti in the 2000s, a cross-sectional analysis across the 42 Haitian arron-&#13;
  dissements was run. This strategy has the advantage of allowing us to control for national level fac-&#13;
  tors that may not be properly observable in cross-country analyses and may be endogenous to&#13;
  conflict. In addition the within-country analysis relies on a more homogenous definition of con-&#13;
  flict events than a cross-country analysis, although coming at a cost of not allowing for the investi-&#13;
  gation of the role of factors that do not vary across spatial units or over the period of analysis, such&#13;
  as the political regime and the oligopolistic nature of the economy.&#13;
  We used data on conflict events from the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data (ACLED) Project,&#13;
  which collects and codes media reports on civil and communal conflicts, militia interactions, vio-&#13;
  lence against civilians, rioting, and protests across various countries since 1997. In the case of Haiti&#13;
  the data is available between 1997 and July 2010. We aggregated the individual conflict events at the&#13;
  department and sub-department (â&#128;&#156;Arrondissementâ&#128;&#157;) level to construct time varying conflict inten-&#13;
  sity measures at our unit of analysis.&#13;
  We complement these data with data on crimes collected by MINUSTAH mainly on the basis of&#13;
  Haiti National Police (HNP) reports. These data are more recent, covering the period 2010 to&#13;
  September 2014, although not strictly comparable with the conflict events data as they include a&#13;
  broad variety of criminal activities, such as robberies, thefts, homicides, rapes, illegal possession of&#13;
  firearms. Most of these events are not related to political violence or political actions as it is the case&#13;
  for the events recorded by ACLED. Nevertheless, they provide a useful additional dimension and&#13;
  allow us to gauge the latest developments in violence in Haiti.&#13;
  The results of our analysis suggest that violence in Haiti in the last decade tends to be predomi-&#13;
  nantly an urban phenomenon. Both political violence and criminal activities are concentrated in&#13;
  urban centers. A higher share of immigrants from other areas of the country is also associated with&#13;
  higher conflict intensity. This result is mainly driven by the fact that a higher migrantsâ&#128;&#153; share is as-&#13;
  sociated with a lower presence of social networks (measured as extended families and kinship),&#13;
  which reduce conflict. The analysis would also indicate that past conflict and land ownership are all&#13;
  important correlates of violence.&#13;
  In addition, the results suggest that economic shocks matter a great deal in explaining the pattern&#13;
  of conflict in Haiti. In particular, increases in remittances are associated with a reduction in conflict&#13;
  intensity, consistent with the idea that by raising incomes they raise the opportunity cost of partici-&#13;
  pating into violent activities. Finally, the evidence suggests that election periods amplify the effect&#13;
  of economic shocks on conflict.&#13;

&amp;#12;  BOX 4.2â&#128;&#131; ElectricitÃ© dâ&#128;&#153;HaÃ¯ti (EDH)&#13;
&#13;
  Due to poor management, the performance of the national, vertically integrated electricity utility&#13;
  ElectricitÃ© dâ&#128;&#153;HaÃ¯ti (EDH) has deteriorated over time. Worsening commercial performance has led&#13;
  to a lack of infrastructure maintenance and has rapidly deteriorated the quality of electricity ser-&#13;
  vice, including frequent service interruptions and large voltage fluctuations. The sectorâ&#128;&#153;s institu-&#13;
  tional framework is obsolete (e.g., not allowing EDH to tap into important renewable energy&#13;
  potential), sector policies are out of date, planning and monitoring of sector activities is inade-&#13;
  quate, and vested interests have hampered reform efforts. The effect of the earthquake on power&#13;
  generation, transmission, and distribution further aggravated EDHâ&#128;&#153;s weak performance by delay-&#13;
  ing key modernization activities (e.g., new billing system and the rehabilitation of the Peligre hy-&#13;
  dropower plant). In 2015, EDHâ&#128;&#153;s losses stood at 57 percent of the electricity generated (of which&#13;
  commercial losses represented nearly 35 percent).&#13;
  EDHâ&#128;&#153;s weak grid infrastructure, poor commercial performance, and inadequate controls over sub-&#13;
  contracted electricity generation by independent power producers (IPPs) have led to a financial&#13;
  drain on government resources. Due to its inability to meet electricity demand and in an attempt&#13;
  to expand electricity availability, EDH has subcontracted part of the production of electricity to&#13;
  IPPs.a Unable to cover its operating expenses, including fuel costs and power purchases in part be-&#13;
  cause of low bill collection rates, EDH has relied on fiscal transfers from the Treasury averaging&#13;
  US$200 million annually in recent years (equivalent to 10 percent of the national budget and 1â&#128;&#147;2&#13;
  percent of GDP).b&#13;
  Past governance reforms to preserve the integrity of public resource management in the electric-&#13;
  ity sector have produced modest results. Achievements to-date include: (a) EDH Commercial&#13;
  Recovery action plans (2012â&#128;&#147;2013; 2013â&#128;&#147;2014; and 2014â&#128;&#147;2015); (b) a National Directions Paper&#13;
  (endorsed by Cabinet on September 15, 2013); and (c) a government Energy White Paper (in&#13;
  draft). Since 2014, an active dialogue on the management and reform of the energy sector has&#13;
  been initiated within the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Energy Commission and with the strategic partners in the&#13;
  sector.&#13;
  a. IPPs provided 60 percent of total electricity generation in 2011.&#13;
  b. Electricity transfers are unbounded due to their dependence on international oil prices, electricity supply, unsanctioned theft and&#13;
  bill non-payment, inter alia.&#13;

government deposits needed to be drawn                                   lower international oil prices imply a higher&#13;
down (figure 4.10). Wider fiscal and current                             payment rate and less concessional financ-&#13;
account deficits are also raising concerns                               ing. With lower international oil prices, Haiti&#13;
about a crowding out of private sector credit                            has experienced a substantial decline in the&#13;
with a monetary stance becoming tighter to                               availability of concessional financing.&#13;
contain the mounting pressures on Haitiâ&#128;&#153;s                                International oil prices are expected to re-&#13;
currency.                                                                main low in the near future, making it even&#13;
   The recent decline in international oil                               more challenging for the country to balance&#13;
prices is further tightening fiscal resources.                           the need to ensure macroeconomic stability&#13;
According to the Petrocaribe agreement,                                  while protecting the social and investment&#13;

   to Haitia&#13;
&#13;
   We estimate economic magnitudes for key correlates of income growth at the mean, the bottom 40&#13;
   and 20 percent of the income distribution across a set of about 100 countries. While econometric&#13;
   exercises investigating determinants of GDP growth have been numerous, less is known about facÂ­&#13;
   tors influencing household incomes at different segments of the income distribution. Empirical&#13;
   work by Dollar and Kraay (2002) and Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013) broadly rejects the&#13;
   idea that other factors than mean income growth would influence incomes of the poor, thus sugÂ­&#13;
   gesting that growth would be mostly distribution neutral, whereas other studies have attempted to&#13;
   outline key drivers of pro-poor growth (e.g., Bourguignon 2003; Ravallion and Chen 2007;&#13;
   Christiaensen, Punam, and Sanoh 2013). Our results add to this discussion and suggest that some&#13;
   factors indeed allow growth to be more beneficial for the bottom 40 or 20 percent of the income&#13;
   distribution.&#13;
   Our data set is mainly based on Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013). The data covers household data&#13;
   from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s POVCALNET and the Luxembourg Income Study databases. Household&#13;
   income data is organized in â&#128;&#156;spells,â&#128;&#157; i.e., income changes between two survey years, calculated as&#13;
   average annual log differences.b These are calculated for average income, income at the bottom 20&#13;
   percent or the bottom 40 percent. We focus on those non-overlapping spells that are at least five&#13;
   years long, providing 299 spells for 117 countries with a median spell length of 6 years, which is&#13;
   also the preferred sample of Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013). To this data, we add macroecoÂ­&#13;
   nomic variables, especially measures of political stability or institutions that are of particular interÂ­&#13;
   est for Haiti.&#13;
   Based on a fixed effect estimation, the results confirm that the income at the bottom 20 and 40&#13;
   percent grow with mean income. The estimated effect is a little smaller than previously thought, alÂ­&#13;
   though the estimated elasticity around 0.85 is statistically not significantly different from one. We&#13;
   also find that better health and education outcomes, as well as lower political instability, have an&#13;
   economically relevant effect for income growth that goes beyond the effect via mean income (i.e., it&#13;
   is stronger at the bottom of the distribution).&#13;

from Cross-Country Evidence?a&#13;
&#13;
Azam (2001) observed that â&#128;&#156;the occurrence of civil conflict is intimately related to the failure of govÂ­&#13;
ernment to deliver the type of public expenditure that people want; i.e., with a strong redistributive&#13;
component such as health and education.â&#128;&#157; Governments could thus foster their legitimacy, and thereby&#13;
reduce the risk of conflict, by signaling that they care about their population. This could be done in a&#13;
variety of ways, such as increased spending for water sanitation, securing basic health needs, or providÂ­&#13;
ing a strong system of education (Stasavage 2005).&#13;

(2006) suggests that education promotes social cohesion by encouraging students to cultivate interperÂ­&#13;
sonal skills and thus learn how to resolve disputes peacefully.&#13;
Our empirical analysis covers 148 countries over 1960â&#128;&#147;2009 and uses a random effects logit model&#13;
with regional dummies and a set of standard control variables to predict the probability of conflict.&#13;
To measure the onset of violent conflict, we used the Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD) from the&#13;
Uppsala Conflict Data Program PRIO for years 1960â&#128;&#147;2009 (Gleditsch etÂ al. 2002, Version 4.1.) to&#13;
generate a dichotomous variable that takes the value of one in years with a new conflict onset and&#13;
zero otherwise. This dataset has become the standard reference for cross-country analyses of conÂ­&#13;
flict determinants. The onset of conflict was defined with those above a threshold of 25 battle&#13;
deaths per year.&#13;
The results suggest that higher welfare expenditure (education, health and social) is associated with&#13;
lower risk of conflict. In order to simulate the effects for Haiti, the coefficients of the cross-country&#13;
regression were taken and all variables in the model set at their average for Haiti with the exception&#13;
for welfare spending that we let vary. The Figure above illustrates the reduction in the risk on conÂ­&#13;
flict onset associated with higher welfare spending.&#13;

&amp;#12;   BOX 5.3â&#128;&#131; Bank-Sponsored Competition of Academic Papers&#13;
&#13;
   In order to foster research and debate, a call was issued for research papers identifying the most&#13;
   critical constraints and opportunities facing Haiti in accelerating progress toward the goals of endÂ­&#13;
   ing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The competition was&#13;
   open to all Haitian scholars and was intended to provide a Haitian perspective to the debate, as well&#13;
   as identify any issue that the existing literature may have over-looked.&#13;
   This proposal and the rules were prepared with the Deans of the universities present in Port-au-&#13;
   Prince. The competition was widely advertised in academic circles and in regular newspapers, and&#13;
   submissions were received from Haiti (Port-au-Prince and Cap HaÃ¯tien), Canada and the United&#13;
   States. The papers were reviewed by a panel of World Bank researchers and leading Haitian figures,&#13;
   including the Presidents of the Association of Haitian Economists, the Haitian Arbitration and&#13;
   Mediation Division, and the North-East Chamber of Commerce, as well as professors from the&#13;
   American University and the Autonomous University of Mexico.&#13;
   The three winners were awarded cash prizes for their contributions and presented their work at a&#13;
   conference at the State University of Haiti in November, 2014. The event was attended by represenÂ­&#13;
   tatives from academia, civil society, government, and the international community. This was an&#13;
   opportunity to discuss issues related to inequality, inadequate competition and economic opportuÂ­&#13;
   nities, and the absence of a social contract between the State and its citizens which, among other isÂ­&#13;
   sues, were identified by the participants as impediments to growth.&#13;
   More particularly, while the papers submitted varied in approaches and emphases, they converged&#13;
   on a common set of themes underscoring Haitiâ&#128;&#153;s scarcity of human and institutional capital. Most&#13;
   authors agreed that Haitiâ&#128;&#153;s history of violence, exclusion, and foreign interference explained the&#13;
   countryâ&#128;&#153;s difficulty in developing a shared national vision for its future, as well as the needed instiÂ­&#13;
   tutions and social capital to implement it. All papers argued that aid dependence and the interferÂ­&#13;
   ence of external governmental and non-governmental actors continued to prevent Haiti from&#13;
   developing home-grown solutions and institutional capacity. In this regard, authors stressed the&#13;
   Stateâ&#128;&#153;s ineffectiveness in fulfilling basic functions, such as enforcing the rule of law, collecting taxes,&#13;
   and delivering services. Poor outcomes in education were seen by most as a principal cause of&#13;
   Haitiâ&#128;&#153;s poor governance, lack of competitiveness, low productivity, and high unemployment.&#13;
   Urbanization and population growth were identified as major contributors to vulnerability, and the&#13;
   need for a more balanced spatial organization of the country was underscored.&#13;

            Haiti - Toward a new narrative : systematic
            country diagnostic

        <abstracts>
            Areas of economic opportunity for Haiti
            include agribusiness, light manufacturing, and tourism.
            Building on these opportunities, the Government of Haiti
            issued in May 2012 a strategic development plan (PSDH),
            aiming at building a new modern, diversified, resilient,
            competitive, and inclusive economy, respectful of its
            environment and in which people’s basic needs are met. This
            systematic country diagnostic (SCD) seeks to identify the
            most important constraints to and opportunities for
            inclusive and sustainable growth in Haiti. To identify the
            key constraints to Haiti’s growth and shared prosperity, an
            extensive review of the literature (from both within and
            outside the World Bank) was first carried out. This report
            attempts to provide some prioritization and identify the
            most binding constraints, both quantitatively and through a
            series of consultations with stakeholders and the country team.
