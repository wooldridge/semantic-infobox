the changes in the countries of Eastern Europe      1    19&#13;

In fiscal 1993, MIGA extended $50 million in political risk insurance to the FirstNational&#13;
Bank of Boston, for its investment in Argentina which was the basis for creating a 10-year&#13;
home mortgage program. The program has been a great success, enabling the Bank of Boston to&#13;
offer longer term home mortgages in Argentina for the first time since the 1980s. In December&#13;
1992, rates for 1 to 10-year mortgages were between 19 to 22 percent, depending on the size of&#13;
the loan. A year later, as a partial result of the Bank of Boston's initiative, rates were down to&#13;
between 14.9 to 16.9 percent for 1 to 20-year mortgages with significant savings for the cus-&#13;
tomer. In addition, the prOject generated substantial local employment benefis A total of 133&#13;
people are employed and trained to administer the Bank's home mortgage prgram; 116 are&#13;
involved in sales and 17 in marketing, credit analysis, and administratiom Thus, the project&#13;

During fiscal 1994, MIG.Xs management reviewed the Agency's activities with a view to&#13;
rationalizing World BanldFCMIGA technical assistance activities and ensuring that the&#13;
Agency's reserves were building as rapidly as possible.&#13;
Article 23 of MIGCA Convention differentiates between investment promotion and policy&#13;
advice aimed at improving the investment climate and conditions in its Category II members.&#13;
The investment promotion function involves disseminating information on investment oppor-&#13;
tunities and related activities that encourage investment flows. Investment promotion also&#13;
supports the guarantee program: projects identified during imnstent promorion activities may&#13;
lead to guarantee applicadons, and local investment promotion agencies assist in marketing&#13;
MIGA's guarantee products.&#13;
Since the investment advisory services MIGA carried out in conjunction with FIAS are&#13;
also being addressed by the World Bank and EFC, MIGA has decided to focus its technical&#13;
assistance activities exclusively on investment promotion after July 1, 1994. Given this new&#13;
focus on promotional actvities, the former Policy and Advisory Services Deparent has been&#13;
renamed the Investment Marketing Services Departnent (HIS) to reflect its new functions&#13;
more accurately.&#13;

Promoting International Links for Egyptian Firms&#13;
FIAS and [FC conducted a joint study of business links between) Egyptian and foreign&#13;
finns in six sectors The study, based primarily on questionnaires and interviews with Egyptian&#13;
and foreign firms, examined the development of international links in Egypt; their origins,&#13;
benefits and costs, and impediments to new links. The study concluded that linkages were&#13;
present in all the sectors examined, but it also found chat Egypt was at a relatively early stage in&#13;
developing ties to foreign firms, and needed to rake several actions to increase these links and&#13;
their benefits.&#13;
FHAS - in conjunction with MIGA, UNIDO, and the Egyptian govemment -followed&#13;
up the s.udy with a Cairo workshop to develop mechanisms for promoting intemational busi-&#13;
ness links and helping Egyptian firms find foreign partners to supply technology and market-&#13;
ing, and devetop management contracts, strategic alliances, and direct investment The work-&#13;
shop attracted participants from the Egyptian private sectorand the foreign business community,&#13;
and experts and representatives from bilateral and multilateral agencies. The workshop exam-&#13;
ined opportunities and impediments to international parmnerships, the experience of countries&#13;
chat have successflly promoted these kinds of links, and mechanisrms for fcilitating links for&#13;
a sample of firms.&#13;

Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
Statement of Agency Purpose&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a&#13;
member of the World Bank Group. The Agency is designed to help developing countries attract&#13;
productive foreign investment by both private investors and commercially operated public sector&#13;
companies. Its facilities include guarantees against noncommercial risks and a program of&#13;
consultative and advisoryservices to promote improvements in member countries' environments&#13;
for foreign investment.&#13;
Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies&#13;
MICGAs financial statements have been prepared in conformity with Intemational Accounting&#13;
Standards. In the absence of such standards, then, subject to relevant legal requirements, the&#13;
policy adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA having regard&#13;
to the accounting principles used in the United States and the practices of other intemational&#13;
insurance entities. The following summary of policies adopted by MIGA is- provided to assist&#13;
readers in the interpretation of these financial statements. The accounting policies fbllowed&#13;
generally are consistent in all material respects with accounting principles in the United States.&#13;
Translation of Currencies&#13;
MiGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars solely for the purpose&#13;
of summarizing financial position and the results of its operations for the convenience of its&#13;
meembers and other interested parties.&#13;
MIGA is an intemational organization that may conduct its operations in the currencies of all its&#13;
members. MIGA's resources are derived from its capital and accumulated earnings in its members'&#13;
currencies. MIGA strives to minimize exchange rate risks in a multicurrency environment. As&#13;
such, MIGA attempts to match its contingent obligations in any one currency with assets in the&#13;
same currency.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions to match the currencies&#13;
underlying its reserves with those of the outstanding contingencies. The purpose of these&#13;
conversionswill betominimize currencyexposure chatmayoccurthroughoperations. Otherwise,&#13;
MIGA will not convert one currency into another except for small amounts required to meet&#13;
cerain operational needs.&#13;
Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange at the end of the period. Capital&#13;
subscriptions are stated in accordance with the procedures described below. Income and expenses&#13;
are generally translated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect during each month.&#13;
Translation adjustments are charged or credited to retained eamings.&#13;

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock&#13;
Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock of&#13;
MIGA shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the SDR in terms of United States&#13;
dollars for the period January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being equal to $1.082 for one&#13;
SDR. The Convention further staes that ten percent of the members' shares be paid in cash, in&#13;
freely convertible currencies, except that developing member countries may pay up to a quarter&#13;
of the ten percent in their own currencies. In addition, another ten percent of the members&#13;
shares shall be paid in the form of nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing promissory notes. The&#13;
notes are denominated in freely convertible currencies and are due on demand. The policies&#13;
relating to translation of currencies as described above also apply to the cash and the promissory&#13;
notes paid in.&#13;
Investmelits&#13;
MIGA's investment holdings are valued at cost or amortized cost Gains or losses on sale of&#13;
investments, measured by the difference between the cost (on a last-in, first-out basis) and&#13;
proceeds of sales, are recorded as an element of income from investments.&#13;
Revenue Recognition&#13;
Revenue from premium payments for both direct insurance and assumed reinrance contracts is&#13;
recognized on a pro rata basis over the contract period. Revenue firm commitment fees, which&#13;
are fees paid by investors to reserve for a limited period of time guarantee capacity for future use,&#13;
is recognized on a pro rara basis over the commitmnent period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
The reserve for claims provides for losses inherent in guarantee operations based upon clain&#13;
submissions, consideraton of loss experiences by insurers engaged in similar undenwritings, and&#13;
other factors including changes in the composition and volume ofthe insurance and outstanding&#13;
guarantees and worldwide economic and political conditions. The reserve is increased by&#13;
provisions charged to expense and decreased for claims setdements&#13;
Recognizing the fact that during the early years of the Agency's operations when its cash reserves&#13;
are small in relation to its obligations assumed under its insurance activities and when there is&#13;
limited history for estimation of losses, it is understood, in accordance with the provisions of the&#13;
Convention, that the promissory note portion of the subscribed capital would be utilized to pay&#13;
any claims in excess of the reserve.&#13;
Acquisition Costs&#13;
Costs of acquiring investment guarantees business are expensed in the year incurred, as such&#13;
amounts are not material.&#13;

to 350 percent of the sum of the Agency's unimpaired subscribed capital, its reserves and such&#13;
portion of the insurance ceded by the Agency through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of&#13;
Directors may detrmine. Such increase shal be accomplished in two srages: (i) an increae to 250&#13;
perent shall be effective immediately (thus, at June 30, 1994, the maximum level of guarantees&#13;
outstanding could not exceed $2,607,455,000) and (ii) an increase to 350 percent shall be&#13;
considered by the Board of Directors once the sum of the Agency's actual level of contingent&#13;
