THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   Since Zambia's independence in 1964, copper has consistently remained at the&#13;
center of its economy -- even after copper prices collapsed in 1975, leaving the country&#13;
heavily indebted and poorer. Several partial attempts at economic reforms during the&#13;
1980s not only had little positive impact on growth but also increased the debt burden of&#13;
the country. Arrears accumulated, and the Bank and IMF suspended lending operation&#13;
between 1987 and November 1991 (except for a brief period in 1991). Following&#13;
elections in 1991, and a change in government, these operations resumed. Over the past&#13;
five years, Zambia has implemented one of the most ambitious and comprehensive&#13;
economic reform programs on the African continent with considerable support from the&#13;
donor community. In support of this program, the Bank has implemented five adjustment&#13;
operations with the sixth one approved in August 1996. The country is also reorganizing&#13;
and reducing its debt. A Commercial Debt Reduction Operation has been concluded.&#13;
Zambia also finished a Rights Accumulation Program with the Fund in 1995 and began&#13;
an ESAF program.&#13;
1.2   Significant success in the policy reform area has not, however, yet put the country&#13;
on a growth path which would reduce dependence on external assistance and be&#13;
sustainable in the medium to long run. The newly liberalized economic system exposed&#13;
the inefficiencies inherent in the Zambian industrial sector which was established with the&#13;
purpose of import-substitution and dominated by parastatals. The obsolete equipment&#13;
and processing techniques, and outdated product-mix of Zambian firms not only have&#13;
prevented them from penetrating export markets but also have put these firms in a&#13;
competitively disadvantageous position with the imported products in the domestic&#13;
markets.  Thus, a significant job loss occurred in the industrial sector with the&#13;
implementation of the economic reform prograrn. Although some contraction of&#13;
inefficient operations was inevitable, output and employment losses were exacerbated by&#13;
the high degree of dependence of manufacturing activities on purchases by the state-&#13;
owned copper company (ZCCM), which also has shrunk considerably.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.3   Lack of significant supply response has become a major concern for Zambia's&#13;
reform program. Delays in supply response threaten the economic reform program by&#13;
contributing to serious political and poverty issues especially in the urban areas where&#13;
about half of the population live. For a supply response to occur: (i) Zambian firms need&#13;
to reinvest in their operations by acquiring new technologies and equipment which could&#13;
make them competitive both in Zambia and abroad; and (ii) Zambian entrepreneurs need&#13;
to take advantage of the emerging opportunities within the new liberal economic system.&#13;
1.4   There are two types of factors accounting for the lack of supply response--&#13;
economy-wide and firm-related factors. The economy-wide factors stem from general&#13;
economic and social problems and include: (i) unstable macroeconomy; (ii)&#13;
underdeveloped physical infrastructure which causes logistical problems; and (iii)&#13;
deficiencies in education and in industrial training which constrain labor productivity.&#13;
The second type of constraining factors arise from the characteristics of Zambian firms&#13;
and Zambian financial sector: (i) Zambian firms which were established under an import-&#13;
substitution regime in a highly protective environment have inefficient operations; (ii)&#13;
Zambian firms have limited capabilities to pro-actively seek out ways and means of&#13;
transforming their business into viable enterprises in a liberal economy; (ii) Zambia's&#13;
financial sector does not have sources of funds to provide necessary long term finance for&#13;
investments, and working capital needs of exporters; and (iii) institutional underpinnings&#13;
of the newly liberalized financial system are weak and the recent bank failures have&#13;
undermined public confidence. In addition to these factors, Zambia recently has been hit&#13;
with an unusual frequency of droughts with two major and one minor drought in the last&#13;
five years.&#13;
1.5   There have significant efforts to address economy-wide and sectoral problems on&#13;
the part of the donor community. The World Bank/IDA and the IMF have been carrying&#13;
out macroeconomic dialogue through a series of operations which are closely&#13;
coordinated. The Bank/IDA also have a portfolio of continuing operations involving&#13;
infrastructure, agriculture, environment, health and education. The various other donors&#13;
have been providing assistance directed towards these purposes as well as to some&#13;
specific industrial sectors (e.g. horticulture, tobacco, coffee) and to certain sections of the&#13;
society (e.g. micro-scale entrepreneurs). However, there has not been a concerted effort&#13;
to address firm-related factors.&#13;
1.6   Zambia's macroeconomic reform program thus needs to be complemented with&#13;
micro-level focused projects, and the proposed project is specifically designed for this&#13;
purpose. It would support firm-level efforts at restructuring by: (i) providing advice&#13;
through the use of matching grants; (ii) providing long-term credit facility for investment;&#13;
(iii) providing a short-term credit line for exporters; (iv) providing technical assistance to&#13;
help strengthen the institutional underpinnings of the financial system--wholesale, retail,&#13;
and regulatory; and (v) providing technical assistance to create a common and easily&#13;
accessible information and data base with modern tools for Zambian entrepreneurs,&#13;
through the Export Board of Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
2. MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT&#13;
2.1   Inflation. Inflation was unacceptably high during the late 1980s and in the first&#13;
half of the 1 990s, averaging 44 percent per annum between 1985 - 1987 and increasing to&#13;
55 percent in 1988 following the abandonment of the economic reform program.&#13;
Inflation accelerated to 130 percent in 1989 and stayed at around 100 percent until 1992.&#13;
In 1992, inflation jumped to 200 percent and continued at these levels until 1994. In&#13;
1994, better monetary control was established, and inflation fell to 53 percent in 1994 and&#13;
to 40 percent level in 1995. Inflation in 1996 was about 35 percent and is currently&#13;
projected to decline to below 20 percent next year.&#13;
2.2   Exchange Rate. The official value of Zambia's currency (Kwacha) appreciated&#13;
significantly after the mid 1980s when policy focus turned inward. The real exchange rate&#13;
remained relatively constant in the early 1990s, after a brief depreciation at the beginning&#13;
of the decade, in spite of trade liberalization. The real rate appreciated sharply for a few&#13;
months in the late 1993, but that was followed by a sharp depreciation in the same year.&#13;
A slight downward trend in the index of real exchange rate which had started in the late&#13;
1994 continued throughout 1995. The index of real exchange rate depreciated early in&#13;
1996 and appreciated back to its 1995 level towards the end of 1996. The tight&#13;
containment of domestic demand, modest recovery in the price of copper and donor&#13;
inflows significantly influenced the level of exchange rates.&#13;
2.3   Interest Rates.  Until March 1993, lending and borrowing rates were&#13;
administratively determined. Although the rates were supposed to reflect underlying&#13;
inflation, real interest rates in general were negative. Subsequent to the implementation&#13;
of Treasury Bill auctions, the real interest rates turned positive. As a matter of fact, the&#13;
real rates increased sharply with nominal rates. The real rates on treasury instruments&#13;
which became an important determinant of the interest rates on the other financial&#13;
instruments in the economy followed a highly volatile path, including becoming negative&#13;
occasionally, until the middle of 1995 when nominal yields stabilized around 50-60&#13;
percent range with inflation staying around 40 percent. The nominal interest rates stayed&#13;
within the 40 - 55 percent range throughout 1996.&#13;
2.4   Privatization. Zambia embarked on a very comprehensive privatization effort&#13;
with the establishment of Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) in September 1992. Upon&#13;
the approval of PIRC II (Second Privatization and Industrial Reform Credit C25230-ZM)&#13;
in June 1993, the privatization policy found a necessary momentum. After a slow start,&#13;
the process has really taken off over the twelve months from June 1995 to June 1996&#13;
when about 100 companies out of the total 137 were privatized during this period. The&#13;
remaining 98 companies/units in the total portfolio of 235 in the program have mostly&#13;
been prepared for sale or liquidation (see Annex D for a detailed list of these companies).&#13;
Zambia also showed its determination for privatization program by starting the process&#13;
for privatization of ZCCM. A separate program for ZCCM privatization aided by the&#13;
Bank's ERIP TA (Economic Recovery and Investment Promotion Technical Assistance,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
C28750-ZM) credit is well underway and on schedule. Since the bulk of the privatization&#13;
occurred very recently, it is difficult to pass a judgment on the current situation of these&#13;
firms. However, the World Bank findings on the companies that were privatized at the&#13;
earlier stage (in 1994 and early 1995) indicate that there was a rationalizing of the&#13;
products and product lines and improvement in the product quality and financial position&#13;
of these firms. Some of these firms, especially those sold to the foreign investors, also&#13;
engaged in considerable investments. Based on the World Bank staff interviews,&#13;
Zambian business people are also happy with the newly privatized companies and they&#13;
indicated that these companies shifted their procurement to domestic companies where&#13;
possible and thus created additional business volume for them.&#13;
2.5   Trade Policies. Although tariff levels were reduced in the early 1990s, trade&#13;
policies by and large remained discriminatory for exporters who import substantial&#13;
amount of inputs until very recently. There were also substantial duties imposed on&#13;
capital goods. The 1996 reforms addressed these problems by introducing much lower&#13;
duties on capital goods and inputs. The duty ranges decreased to 5 - 25 percent from 20 -&#13;
40 percent, with many raw materials and most capital goods subject to tariff levels 0 and&#13;
5 percent, respectively.&#13;
2.6   Investment Performance. Investment in Zambia which averaged about 25% of&#13;
GDP during 1964-1975 era, became stagnant around 14 % of GDP after the collapse of&#13;
copper prices in 1975, and declined further after 1991. It fell to 9.5% of GDP in 1994. In&#13;
1995, investment showed some signs of recovery and increased to 12.5% of GDP which&#13;
is about the average level of investment in the 1990s. An increased investment demand&#13;
was observed from recent firm visits and interviews with the commercial banks. It&#13;
appears that this increase in investment demand is due to three factors: a, investors have&#13;
begun to discover their competitive edge (especially in activities which add value to local&#13;
raw materials); b) increased privatization activity (a total of 137 companies were&#13;
privatized, including some very big parastatals such as Chilanga Cement and Zambia&#13;
Breweries) and the desire of new owners and potential owners to rehabilitate these&#13;
companies; and c) the excellent harvest in 1996.&#13;
2.7   Recent Performance Under Reform Program. Although Zambia's economic&#13;
reform program has enjoyed an exceptional level of international support, the events of&#13;
the last year related to the elections, on top of long-standing good governance concerns,&#13;
have resulted in a deterioration of relations between Zambia and its bilateral partners.&#13;
This led to a suspension in June of bilateral balance of payments support.&#13;
2.8   Meanwhile, Zambia's performance in meeting the IMF ESAF benchmarks has&#13;
been by and large satisfactory though, at times, implementation has been uneven. For&#13;
example, six of the end December 1995 benchmarks were not met due in large part to the&#13;
poor financial performance of ZCCM. Corrective actions were taken, however, and&#13;
Zambia has met the revised targets for end-March, end-June and end-September targets.&#13;
The Bank's newly approved adjustment loan disbursed its first tranche ($45 million) in&#13;
October, after a joint IMF/Bank mission confirmed that the September targets have also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
been met. Based on the performance through 1996, the IMF mid-term review of the&#13;
current ESAF program was approved by the IMF Board on February 28, 1997. The&#13;
bilateral donors and the Government have also resumed a constructive dialog on&#13;
governance and economic policy issues. The next Consultative Group meeting is&#13;
scheduled for July 1997.&#13;
3. THE PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
A.    Origin and Evolution of The Private Sector&#13;
3.1    Origin and Early Developments.  The presence of private entrepreneurs in&#13;
Zambia dates back to the pre-independence period. After Independence this private&#13;
sector, which had extensive foreign interests, was viewed with suspicion -- resulting in&#13;
the 1968 "Mulungushi Reforms" which nationalized large scale non-mining operations.&#13;
The "Matero Reforms" of 1969 extended the nationalization process to mines. The&#13;
private activity which survived was either in the form of minority shareholding in the&#13;
nationalized companies (e.g. Lonrho, Anglo-American, Tate&amp;Lyle, Dunlop, Duncan&#13;
Gilbey &amp; Matheson, Shell, etc.) or as multinational corporations (e.g. Coca-Cola,&#13;

3.2    Recent Developments.  The recent liberalization program created two major&#13;
trends in the private sector. First, there is increased activity in informal sector, mainly by&#13;
small traders and street vendors. Second, there is increased activity in the formation of&#13;
new companies. Table I below shows that total company registrations averaged about&#13;
2250 per year in the 1990s, with a total of over 11,000 new companies created (details are&#13;
presented in Annex A). Trading sectors (import/export, wholesale and retail grocers) have&#13;
the biggest share in the newly formed companies. Some new companies have also been&#13;
created in the sectors where there had not been any significant activity prior to&#13;
liberalization, such as financial services.&#13;

B.    Basic Characteristics of the Entrepreneurs&#13;
3.3    The ongoing RPED (Regional Programme for Enterprise Development) Surveyl&#13;
offers some very valuable insights as to the characteristics of Zambian manufacturing&#13;
firms as well as perceived handicaps for further business development. As Tables 2 and 3&#13;
show, some important conclusions of this survey regarding the basic characteristics of the&#13;
Zambian firms are that:&#13;
*  Ethnic Africans are very new to the business scene, they are younger than European&#13;
and Asian origin entrepreneurs, and the vast majority of them have established the&#13;
businesses they owned;&#13;
*  Even though the general level of education is fairly low, entrepreneurs are typically&#13;
better educated than the average Zambian and have considerable industry experience.&#13;
While 66.5 percent of entrepreneurs have no more than high school education, 15.6&#13;
percent reached university level while 3.2 percent had undertaken some sort of&#13;
technical/polytechnical or professional training;&#13;
*  Firms that are established at a small scale, stay small. This is particularly true for&#13;
firms owned by ethnic Africans. Thus, of the 76 firms in the survey which employed&#13;
fewer than five people at start up, after a subsequent average 11.7 years in business,&#13;
only 27.6 percent (21 firms) had more than 10 employees;&#13;
* Lack of funds appears to be an obstacle both to the establishment and the&#13;
development of firms.&#13;
RPED is an ongoing research program in six African Countries (Cote d'lvoire, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania,&#13;
Zambia, and Zimbabwe) directed by the World Bank and sponsored by eleven other bi-lateral donor&#13;
institutions.&#13;

C.    The Scope of the Private Sector&#13;
3.4    It is very difficult to estimate the aggregate size of Zambia's private sector, as the&#13;
country's national accounts do not decompose changes in output into their public and&#13;
private components. Employment statistics are, thus, often used as an indication of the&#13;
size of and the trends in the sector. The most recent available figures (see Annex B)&#13;
indicate that the total employment loss is about 10 percent since 1991. The parastatal&#13;
sector has the highest ratio of job loss, with about 15 percent during this period while the&#13;
private sector employment decreased about 5 percent.&#13;
3.5    Composition of Manufacturing Activities. Zambia's portfolio of manufacturing&#13;
activities has had substantial structural shifts since 1975. However the nature of these&#13;
shifts are quite different in the pre-1990 era and the post-1990 era. The former is mainly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
due to stagnant demand, while the latter is attributable to the changes in macroeconomic&#13;
environment.&#13;

The above table needs to be further disaggregated in order to grasp the dynamics of the&#13;
impact of the recent economic policies. For example, although textiles show a significant&#13;
decline in the index value, manufacturing of cotton yarn -- which yields significant&#13;
portion of non-traditional exports -- has been a boom sector for Zambia. The decline in&#13;
the index is mainly due to closures of the manufacturers of higher end products (such as&#13;
woven textiles and garments) which could not compete with imports. Similarly, there are&#13;
significant signs of growth in certain segments of wood related industries even though the&#13;
index is showing a continuos decline&#13;
D.    Enterprise Development Constraints&#13;
3.6   In the RPED survey, Zambian firms of all sizes identified lack of access to credit,&#13;
competition from imports, insufficient demand, and infra-structural weaknesses as their&#13;
most difficult constraints -- although there is some variation in perceptions by sector of&#13;
activity and by firm size. The summary results of these perceived constraints are&#13;
presented in Table 5. Access to finance is more difficult for smaller firms, while&#13;
competition from imports threatens more the larger firms. It is interesting to note that&#13;
Zambian firms do not consider government restrictions to be a handicap for business&#13;
growth. On the other hand, inflation is perceived to be a significant burden.&#13;

E.     Export Potential and Constraints&#13;
3.7    Aggregate Exports.  Zambian exports are dominated by traditional mining&#13;
products -- copper, lead, zinc, and cobalt. However, reserves in the existing mines of&#13;
these metals are rapidly being depleted. Some of these mines are no longer economically&#13;
viable to operate and have closed--such as Kabwe lead mines--and others are facing&#13;
closures. Despite increases in non-traditional exports (see below) total exports have&#13;
declined in tandem with the decline in traditional exports.&#13;

3.8    Non- Traditional Exports (NTE).  Zambia's NTEs exports, according to&#13;
preliminary data, has reached to US$215 million in 1996. This figure marks an increase&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
of about 100% since 1990, corresponding to an annual growth rate of about 12%. Their&#13;
share in total exports has thus continually risen -- reaching about 22% in 1996 from about&#13;
10% in 1990. Most of this increase has, however, come from a select few sectors (i.e.&#13;
textiles, floricultural, processed food).&#13;

3.9    The recent Bank study on growth prospects for Zambia projects that NTEs will&#13;
grow at an annual rate of 14.5%, to reach to US$575 million by 2004. By that time,&#13;
traditional exports are expected to be US$910.2 million. The share of NTEs in total&#13;
exports is projected to increase to more than one third of total exports in 2004 of&#13;
estimated US$1.485 billion. The 1996 performance of exports, with about a 30%&#13;
increase over 1995 level, suggest that these projections are well on target.&#13;
3.10   The projected increase in NTE  is mainly due to the opening up of new&#13;
opportunities for Zambia's farmers as a result of the recent liberalization in agriculture.&#13;
The Growth Prospects study projects significant increases in the production of cotton,&#13;
soya beans, groundnuts, and sorghum. These industrial crops are likely to encourage&#13;
down-stream processing. There are already signs: cotton yarn exports have doubled&#13;
almost every year since 1991; and multinational companies are already targeting oil-seed&#13;
processing and organizing outgrower schemes to supply their industrial operations.&#13;

3.11   Comparative Advantages and Disadvantages. Zambia's major roadways,&#13;
power, communication facilities, and financial services are in quite good shape when&#13;
compared to most of the countries in the region. Moreover, Zambian utility prices&#13;
(excluding international telephone charges) are among the lowest in the region.&#13;

Zambia also compares favorably to other countries in terms of wages, and utility costs.&#13;
Although the current productivity levels are far from levels which would make these cost&#13;
advantages really attractive, Zambia has a core-industrial culture, especially around the&#13;
Copperbelt. With the appropriate training and modern management techniques, existing&#13;
industrial labor force could in time become an asset for foot-loose industries, such as&#13;
garments -- especially if South Africa's market becomes more open to the subregion.&#13;
3.12  Zambia's geographical position is, however, a major constraining factor. In&#13;
addition to being land-locked, Zambian exporters have to deal with time delays in ground&#13;
transportation to and from major ports. Significant delays in border crossings create&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
additional financial and logistical problems. The impact of geography is not, however, all&#13;
negative. Any improvement in South Africa's trade practices will certainly create new&#13;
opportunities for Zambian manufacturers in the region's single most important market.&#13;
Zambia also has some potential markets in the North. These markets could in time be&#13;
attractive, especially for Zambia's engineering product sectors and heavier industries.&#13;
Some multinationals in the Copperbelt are already trying to establish themselves in&#13;
countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Zaire. This Northern development is, however,&#13;
constrained by political uncertainties and the pace of economic growth in these countries&#13;
F.    Business Support Services&#13;
3.13   Types of Business Support Organizations.  Zambia has two categories of&#13;
business support organizations: public, and private.  All public organizations were&#13;
established by a parliamentary act with a legal mandate.  These organizations are&#13;
intended to serve specific business segments. Some of them were also given a regulatory&#13;
authority in the sectors in which they operate. The Small Industries Development&#13;
Organization (SIDO), the Investment Center (IC), and the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ)&#13;
are among the most prominent of these organizations (A complete list of these&#13;
organizations is provided in Annex C). These organizations are financed by budget&#13;
allocations, by fees generated, and through support from some donor funded initiatives.&#13;
3.14  Effectiveness of Public Institutions. The effectiveness of the public business&#13;
support services is quite questionable. SIDO currently employs about 1000 people, but&#13;
the recovery rate on its lending activity is below 1%. It also operates some industrial&#13;
estates with tenants paying very low rents. Although the purpose of these estates was to&#13;
provide facilities for emerging small enterprises, most of the tenants are well established&#13;
businesses which have occupied the premises for a long time. GRZ recognized these&#13;
problems and has been trying to restructure SIDO through new legislation.&#13;
3.15   The Investment Center was established through donor funded initiatives as an&#13;
investment promotion agency. However, it also was granted the authority to issue&#13;
investment licenses with special investment incentives, such as exemptions from customs&#13;
and duties.  In practice, the organization has thus far been pre-occupied with&#13;
administering the incentive mechanisms, with very little focus on promotion aspects.&#13;
Recently, in response to a loss of revenues from other sources, the Investment Center&#13;
increased the fees for processing incentives to very high levels. In the light of the newly&#13;
announced trade regime, the Center's ability to generate fees from issuing incentive&#13;
certificates will be severely restricted.&#13;
3.16  The Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) is one of the most successful public&#13;
organizations. EBZ is actively involved in the European Union Export Development&#13;
Program which targets four sectors: tobacco, coffee, textiles and floricultural products. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
is also trying to establish a data base with market information, accessible to Zambian&#13;
firms.&#13;
3.17  Nature of Private Organizations.  Most of the private business support&#13;
organizations are subsidiaries/affiliates of the international audit and consultancy&#13;
companies. There are also a few local consultancy firms, active mainly in donor funded&#13;
projects. Some of these firms are also active in providing advisory services for foreign&#13;
investors and act as an interface between local entrepreneurs and governmental bodies.&#13;
There are a number of business associations; however, their primary focus has been on&#13;
political lobbying on behalf of its members, not providing services to promote business&#13;
restructuring to their members.&#13;
4. FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THEIR REGULATION&#13;
A.    Structure of the Financial Sector&#13;
4.1   Zambia's financial sector is a shrinking sector with highly conservative and very&#13;
short-term focused banks. The sector also has a number of new entrants with inadequate&#13;
capitalization and staffing. The shrinkage and the short-term focus is the direct result of&#13;
macroeconomic instability over the last few years and large domestic public debt.&#13;
4.2   The Size of the Financial Sector. The total size of the financial sector in relation&#13;
to the size of the economy and the country's population suggests a low level of financial&#13;
activity. Moreover, a significant demonetization has occurred in Zambia as the ratio of&#13;
M2 to GDP has decreased to around 12 percent level in 1996 from 22 percent in 1991.&#13;
The relative size of the financial sector assets to the rest of the economy also declined, as&#13;
the ratio of total assets of the banking sector to GDP declined to 20 percent in 1995 from&#13;
44 percent in 1991. Decline in total assets of the banking sector over the last four years is&#13;
58 percent in real terms. (A detailed overview of the financial sector is presented in&#13;
Annex L).&#13;
4.3   Commercial Banks. Zambia's financial sector is dominated by commercial&#13;
banks, of which the three largest hold more than 10% each of total banking-sector assets.&#13;
These are the Government- owned Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) and the&#13;
foreign-owned Barclays Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. Three medium-size banks&#13;
hold assets ranging between 5% and 9% each, of the sector total; one is foreign-owned,&#13;
Stanbic, and two are locally owned, Finance Bank and Union Bank. Out of eleven&#13;
smaller banks, most are locally owned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
4.4   Non-Bank Financial Institutions. Non-bank financial institutions play a small&#13;
role in the Zambian economy. The Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) is technically&#13;
operational but relatively inactive as it awaits listing by companies. Leasing activity is&#13;
largely confined to commercial banks and their leasing subsidiaries. The only building&#13;
society operating in Zambia, while collecting deposits which by March 31, 1995&#13;
amounted to K 10 billion, placed about half of that amount in commercial bank time&#13;
deposits. New mortgage loans have virtually disappeared because of high nominal&#13;
interest rates and interest on existing mortgages was capitalized.&#13;
4.5   The Securities Market.  The securities market is at an early stage of&#13;
development. Government is issuing Treasury Bills of 28 days or longer and bonds up to&#13;
18 months. These GRZ instruments are auctioned weekly by the Bank of Zambia. In&#13;
volume and impact they dominate the financial sector, having reached 62% of M2 by the&#13;
end of 1992, reduced to a more manageable 36% over the last 3 years, but were up again&#13;
to 50% in late 1995. At end-November 1995 Treasury bills outstanding amounted to K&#13;
215 billion against total broad money supply of K415 billion and approximately 12% of&#13;
GDP. As of October 1996, outstanding treasury bills were K248 billion against the total&#13;
broad money supply of K541 billion.&#13;
4.6   Deposits. Total deposits of the banking sector decreased in real terms by 48&#13;
percent during the last six years. The composition of these deposits stayed fairly stable&#13;
over the same period. The new commercial banks started offering higher interest rates&#13;
and despite the recent bank failures, as explained below, and considerable flight of&#13;
deposits to bigger banks smaller banks continue to hold a higher share of total deposits&#13;
than their share in the total assets of the banking sector.&#13;
4.7   Lending. Total credit to private sector and parastatals, which is about 29 percent&#13;
of total banking assets, declined by about 50 percent in real terms since 1990. The&#13;
composition of the lending portfolio has also changed. Credit to mining decreased by&#13;
about 90 percent in the same period while decrease in credit to the manufacturing sector&#13;
is about 73 percent.&#13;
4.8   Zambia's commercial banks have been heavily investing in government securities.&#13;
Current treasury bill holdings of commercial banks are about 44 percent of total deposits.&#13;
Thus, Government has been the major borrower of the financial markets in the recent&#13;
years at the expense of the private and parastatal sector.&#13;
4.9   Recent Trends. The failure of Meridien Bank in 1995 (and two more smaller&#13;
banks after that) has precipitated a trend toward concentration of market shares of bigger&#13;
banks. Depositors moved to the larger, foreign-owned banks for safety, and ZNCB&#13;
suffered a withdrawal of deposits during the period when a proposal to merge it with&#13;
Meridien was being aired. The longer-term effects of the Meridien collapse on the&#13;
structure of the banking market are still unclear. Moreover, the episode has not ended,&#13;
with two small banks failing shortly after Meridien and several others currently not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
complying with BOZ minimum-capital requirements. The liquidation of Meridien is still&#13;
in process.&#13;
4.10  After years of realizing losses, state-owned specialized financial intermediaries&#13;
are being restructured or liquidated. None has played a significant intermediation role&#13;
over the last two years. These include the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ), Lima&#13;
Bank and Exim Bank.&#13;
4.11   There is also a significant effort going on to reorganize ZNCB which holds the&#13;
biggest share of the total banking assets needs to improve its operational guidelines and&#13;
management information systems. The new management developed a reorganization plan&#13;
with the help of international consulting companies. The reorganization plan aims to&#13;
modernize the bank in every respect but requires substantial expenditures. The ultimate&#13;
objective of the plan is to be able to privatize the bank. The implementation of this plan&#13;
has already been started. The workforce has been reduced by 30 percent by the end of&#13;
1996. GRZ is supporting the management's reorganization efforts and it makes the&#13;
proceeds from the privatization of parastatal companies available to ZNCB to close&#13;
and/or to service the outstanding loans to these companies. ZNCB and the government&#13;
requested the World Bank/IDA support for this plan. Recognizing the importance of&#13;
ZNCB to the well-being of the financial system and after extensive consultations with the&#13;
management of ZNCB, BOZ and MOF, the project team decided to support these efforts&#13;
by incorporating a technical assistance component in the proposed project.&#13;
4.12  Disincentives for banks to lend to local businesses can be traced to treasury bill&#13;
policy, inflation and other symptoms of macroeconomic instability. Since the foreign&#13;
exchange regime is fully liberalized, commercial banks have been keeping significant&#13;
deposits with foreign banks offshore. Treasury bills are considered liquid assets for&#13;
meeting the liquidity requirements of commercial banks. At year-end 1995, total lending&#13;
to private and parastatal sectors amounted to K237 billion, representing 25% of&#13;
commercial bank assets. GRZ debt held by banks nearly matched this level, amounting&#13;
to KI 89 billion. During 1996, a healthier trend was observed with the relative increase in&#13;
the share of lending to productive sectors in total assets of the banking sector and a&#13;
decrease in the share of banking sector's claim on GRZ. As of October 1996, total loans&#13;
and advances to private and parastatal sectors was K390 billion representing about 34%&#13;
of the total assets of the banking sector and GRZ debt held by banks were about K192&#13;
billion.&#13;
4.13  All banking activities center on very short-term transactions with interest rates&#13;
adjusted weekly and subject to large fluctuations. Foreign exchange deposits constitute&#13;
18% of all deposits. Commercial bank deposits abroad amount to 130% of the forex&#13;
deposits of their clients. Loans in forex tend to originate with special sources and&#13;
amounted to less than 25% of forex deposits, or K 21.7 billion at year-end 1995. The&#13;
reasons for banks' reluctance to use forex deposits for lending lie mainly in the attitude of&#13;
the forex deposit holders. Commercial banks indicated that their forex deposit holders&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
frequently instruct them to keep or to transfer their funds overseas for various reasons&#13;
including suspicions to the continuation of liberal capital account regime.&#13;
4.14  Credit Market Failures. Zambia's financial sector offers no reliable long-term&#13;
finance. Lack of long-term financial resources, and high inflation and interest rates are&#13;
two reasons for the lack of long-term lending activity. The larger insurance companies&#13;
and pension funds, traditional sources of long-term funds elsewhere, are illiquid and/or&#13;
technically insolvent.&#13;
4.15  Crowding out by 28-day treasury bill activity in financial markets along with high&#13;
inflation which raises nominal and real interest rates, are also effecting the financial&#13;
sector's ability to finance working capital needs for an emerging group of agriculture-&#13;
based exporters. These exporters which are trying to take advantage of the liberalized&#13;
economy are transforming Zambia's agriculture scene by organizing outgrower schemes&#13;
in cash-crops. But, these activities are constrained by the typical need for six to nine&#13;
months--almost medium-term credit in the Zambian context--financing in line with the&#13;
crop cycle and on terms approximate to the prevailing interest rates in major financial&#13;
markets. The kwacha denominated loans are well above world interest rates in real terms&#13;
and the only solution for these exporters is to borrow in foreign exchange. Zambia's&#13;
financial system has no access to fixed-term forex for fixed-term lending.&#13;
B.    Economic Regulation and Monetary Policy&#13;
4.16 Principles of Monetary Policy. Zambia's economic reform policies relied on&#13;
tight fiscal and monetary policies. BOZ refrained from financing fiscal needs through&#13;
money supply expansion and reduced lending to parastatals. GRZ has had to rely on&#13;
selling treasury bills without BOZ fiscal support. This created significant demand and&#13;
caused higher interest rates which in turn caused heavier domestic debt service&#13;
requirements.&#13;
4.17  Liquidity Management. BOZ's preference using statutory reserves and core&#13;
liquidity ratios to manage the liquidity caused further distortions in the financial markets&#13;
by creating a large spread between deposit and lending rates. BOZ now intends to switch&#13;
to open market operations as a means to manage liquidity. Some important elements of&#13;
successful open market operations are far from desired levels. First, accurate and timely&#13;
financial data is needed. Second, a reliable model of forecasting liquidity requirements&#13;
needs to be in place. Third, shocks to the system, such as injecting liquidity to the failing&#13;
financial institutions (in the case of the recent bank failures) must be avoided. BOZ is&#13;
currently assisted in some of these areas by IMF.&#13;
4.18    Foreign Exchange and Capital Account Regulations.  Liberal foreign&#13;
exchange transactions and no restrictions on the capital account transactions create a&#13;
favorable environment for business development especially in attracting foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
investment. However, Zambia still needs to convince all the economic agents that the&#13;
changes are permanent.  Keeping liberal foreign exchange policies becomes very&#13;
important to maintain the stability and confidence in the system. Both BOZ and GRZ are&#13;
committed to this.&#13;
C.   Prudential Regulation and Supervision&#13;
4.19  Current Legislation.  Under current law, BOZ has the authority to issue&#13;
prudential regulations for banking institutions. The new Banking and Financial Services&#13;
Bill has led to introduction of additional regulations. The BOZ is also now able to&#13;
monitor interim developments in the banking system through monthly and quarterly bank&#13;
reports, as well as conduct on-site inspections.&#13;
4.20  Capacity Building Efforts.  Efforts to strengthen the Bank of Zambia's&#13;
supervisory capacity continue under a comprehensive project to modernize the Bank of&#13;
Zambia, which is funded by the IMF, UNDP, SIDA, CIDA, and other donors. This&#13;
project began in 1994 and has included funding for a coordinator, short-term experts, as&#13;
well as in-country and external training. In November 1995, a tripartite review was&#13;
completed during which funding was reallocated to reflect changing priorities.&#13;
4.21  Among the priorities currently being assigned to this project are capacity building,&#13;
strengthening off-site and on-site inspection and developing the regulatory framework for&#13;
implementing the Financial Institutions Act. In view of the failure of Meridien Bank and&#13;
other banks in 1995, however, the BOZ's enforcement capacity and, equally important,&#13;
the political will to enforce prudential regulations remain foremost among the constraints&#13;
impeding effective bank supervision in Zambia.&#13;
4.22  With respect to capacity building, under a staff training program managed through&#13;
the BOZ Personnel Department, courses are being provided by Bank of England staff in&#13;
Zambia and by South African commercial bank staff in Harare, where a regional training&#13;
center has been established. Frequent rotation of BOZ staff at all levels and, in some&#13;
instances, the departure of critical BOZ staff, however, have constrained the effectiveness&#13;
of long-range planning and have contributed to the currently weak state of bank&#13;
supervisory capacity.&#13;
4.23  The improvement of bank-reporting forms is in process under the BOZ&#13;
modernization project, as is the drafting of new inspection manuals and reporting forms&#13;
for non-bank financial intermediaries falling under the BOZ's supervisory authority&#13;
(notably merchant banks, leasing operations and operations of banks in the securities&#13;
market). A short-term adviser has reviewed inspection manuals, advised BOZ staff how&#13;
to prepare for inspection, and is scheduled to train BOZ staff this year in implementing&#13;
on-site inspection procedures. The improvement in bank reporting forms will also need&#13;
to take into account information to assess liquidity, interest and currency risk, as well as&#13;
risks stemming from other operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
4.24  Additional Needs. BOZ will also have to develop procedures for assessing&#13;
banks' capacity to manage their own financial risks. Such risk management is important&#13;
in the areas of liquidity, interest rates, currency and other operations, and will be a key&#13;
criterion in the selection of qualified financial intermediaries to access credit lines under&#13;
the proposed Enterprise Development Project (EDP). There is also an urgent need to&#13;
upgrade on-site inspection capabilities of BOZ. It is envisaged that amendments in&#13;
legislation and the promulgation of regulations will become necessary in due course&#13;
5. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   Origin and Relation with CAS&#13;
5.1   CAS Objectives. The Bank's 1994 Poverty Assessment outlined an action plan&#13;
which was adopted by the government as a focus for Zambia's development objectives.&#13;
The Bank's CAS is supporting a three-pronged strategy to assist the government in&#13;
implementing this action plan, specifically: (i) helping to create a stable macroeconomic&#13;
environment as a prerequisite for growth and employment; (ii) promoting private sector&#13;
development and greater public sector efficiency to stimulate more rapid and inclusive&#13;
growth; and (iii) targeting assistance to poor and vulnerable groups directly. The Bank&#13;
has supported the formulation and implementation of Zambia's economic reform program&#13;
through a combination of adjustment and project lending, and economic and sector work.&#13;
Zambia is now moving to a second stage characterized by continued strong support for&#13;
liberalization and structural policy reform, but with a focus on resuming sustainable&#13;
growth by putting additional emphasis on stimulating investment, improving efficiency,&#13;
and increasing direct poverty reduction efforts.&#13;
5.2   CAS, Ongoing Programs and the Project.  The proposed project would&#13;
complement both adjustment operations and sectoral investment programs in promoting&#13;
private sector development. Higher investment levels would also support macro&#13;
stabilization efforts, and would complement the privatization program by providing&#13;
assistance to privatized companies. The project would also complement ASIP&#13;
(Agricultural Sector Integrated Investment Program C26980-ZM)) by supporting agro-&#13;
businesses.&#13;
5.3   Origin of the Project. This project has its origins in work carried out while&#13;
preparing the Growth Prospects study. An extensive review of the real and monetary&#13;
sectors was conducted, and the results were used as background papers for that study.&#13;
Recognizing several significant market failures, the recent Growth Prospects Study by the&#13;
World Bank recommended "pro-active" initiatives to help Zambian firms reorient their&#13;
business operations and to enhance their access to finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
5.4   Overall Objective. This project aims to complement and support the ongoing&#13;
economic reform program by aiding and facilitating investment in internationally&#13;
competitive economic activities. The current reforms cannot be sustained without the&#13;
Zambian private sector becoming the locomotive of the economic growth. In order for&#13;
Zambian firms to assume such a role they need to adapt to the changing macroeconomic&#13;
environment. For that adaptation to occur, Zambian firms must acquire new technologies&#13;
and equipment and invest into emerging new opportunities. The project is intended to&#13;
remove existing obstacles for Zambian firms to accomplish this. It is not, however,&#13;
intended to prescribe to Zambian firms how to reorient and where to invest. Great care&#13;
was given to make the project a demand-driven project, with credit priced at market rates&#13;
and without any implicit subsidies.&#13;
5.5   Specific Objectives. The project would support firm-level efforts at restructuring&#13;
by: (i) enhancing Zambian firms' technical know-how by providing demand-driven&#13;
technical assistance to Zambian firms in the form of matching grants; (ii) enhancing&#13;
Zambian firms' access to finance by providing a long-term credit facility for investments&#13;
and a short-term credit line for exporters; and (iii) strengthening the financial system and&#13;
availability of information resources in Zambia by providing technical assistance to help&#13;
strengthen the institutional underpinnings of the financial system--wholesale, retail, and&#13;
regulatory-- and by providing technical assistance to create a common and easily&#13;
accessible information and data base with modem tools for Zambian entrepreneurs,&#13;
through the Export Board of Zambia.&#13;
C.    Lessons Learned&#13;
5.6   The project aims to draw on the results of projects, in Zambia and elsewhere, that&#13;
have sought to support on-lending and to strengthen business services. On-lending&#13;
projects have often had limited results because: (i) distortionary terms and conditions of&#13;
onlending led to targeted misallocations of resources; (ii) subsidized credit mechanisms&#13;
did not have the desired real sector impact; (iii) economic reforms did not precede the&#13;
supply support programs; and (iv) projects did not provide adequate support for&#13;
institutional underpinnings of the financial system. The key lessons learned with respect&#13;
to matching grants and technical assistance are: (i) provision of information and&#13;
management should be specialized and tailored to the needs of firms -- generalized&#13;
training and technical assistance should be avoided: (ii) grants to targeted sectors ignored&#13;
some productive sectors--thus, economy wide coverage is desirable; and (iii)&#13;
administering the matching grant schemes through independent executors is more&#13;
efficient and effective. The proposed project design incorporates these lessons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
D.   Project Description&#13;
5.7   Project Components.  The proposed project would have the following&#13;
components. First, the project would have a broad Matching Grant Scheme (MGS)&#13;
which would be used to stimulate the use of support services to assist firms in their&#13;
reorientation. Second, a Multi-purpose Credit Facility (MCF) would be provided through&#13;
the commercial banks to finance investments as well as to stimulate exports. Third,&#13;
institutional development would be supported through technical assistance for financial&#13;
institutions and the Export Board of Zambia.&#13;
5.8   Project Design Features. The overall project design has the following features:&#13;
*  simple project components so that: (i) they could be easily understood by all the&#13;
private sector firms: (ii) they could easily be utilized; and (iii) they could be delivered&#13;
effectively and quickly;&#13;
*  independently manageable project components so that each component can be&#13;
delivered without being effected negatively by any adverse developments in the other&#13;
components;&#13;
*  a decentralized implementation structure so that the management of the project&#13;
components are not burdened with a bureaucracy;&#13;
*  a quick start-up with the only condition of effectiveness requiring the completion of&#13;
the process of hiring of service contractors for MGS and MCF which was started&#13;
immediately after the appraisal and was well advanced by negotiations. Disbursement&#13;
conditions are few, simple, straightforward, and follows automatically from the&#13;
project implementation; and&#13;
easy monitoring of a few, key important performance measures which are generated&#13;
automatically as the project advances and can provide valuable feed-back to policy&#13;
dialogue and complement other operations.&#13;
1.    Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
5.9   Matching grant schemes have been instrumental and quite effective to induce&#13;
firms to use specialized services to enhance their capabilities. These schemes were&#13;
successfully implemented in various countries including: India, Indonesia, Kenya, and&#13;
Mauritius. Following the success of those projects, projects with similar schemes in&#13;
Uganda and Zimbabwe have recently been approved. A project with a similar matching&#13;
grant scheme is being prepared for South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
5.10   Purpose and Scope. A Matching Grant Scheme (MGS) will be made available&#13;
to Zambian firms to promote international competitiveness. MGS is intended to motivate&#13;
firms to use specialized support services to inject technical and managerial know-how&#13;
into their operations. It would do so using a combination of three instruments:&#13;
First, so long as a firm had a written basic development plan, showing the business it&#13;
wished to become, and the steps in getting there, essentially any use it then made&#13;
within this plan of external support services would be eligible for 50% grant support&#13;
towards all fees and travel expenses incurred.&#13;
* Second, firms would be given free hand-holding assistance on how to go about&#13;
utilising support services, in order to incorporate skills, know-how and information&#13;
quickly into their operations [e.g. how to define the tasks, how to find the best&#13;
supplier for the task, how to use the results].&#13;
* Third, although most grants would be "demand-side" grants, as described above, in&#13;
addition and as a way of reaching very small firms, the scheme would assist private&#13;
commercial service providers, private-sector associations, and NGOs to develop their&#13;
capacity to deliver effective services to private firms. It would extend "supply-side"&#13;
matching grants to any such private or NGO operation wishing to use outside help to&#13;
develop its service-supply capacity.&#13;
The grant support would be deliberately temporary. If successful, users of services would&#13;
have become so convinced of their value that they would continue to utilise them, as&#13;
appropriate, at full unsupported market prices.&#13;
5.11   Design Features. In addition, the MGS will have the following specific design&#13;
features:&#13;
* The Scheme would accept applications for the whole project period. With simple and&#13;
clear eligibility criteria, the available funds would be disbursed on a first-come first-&#13;
served basis.&#13;
. The total grant funding available under the proposed project would be US$2.5&#13;
million. However, discussions have already been initiated on the possibility of&#13;
adding to this a further separate fund, under the recently begun Agricultural Sector&#13;
Investment Program (ASIP). This second fund would be allocated specifically for&#13;
agricultural/agribusiness activities, but would operate under virtually identical&#13;
eligibility criteria, with the two funds administered jointly. Further work on this pos-&#13;
sibility will be undertaken with the ASIP team.&#13;
* Given the importance of a few larger firms to the impact of such instruments on the&#13;
Zambian economy, the cap on the maximum grant per firm should be set high. The&#13;
MGS is intended to motivate even big firms to use more support services, and use&#13;
them faster than they would without the incentive. This is equally true of firms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
judged to "be able to afford to do without this help." There would be a cap per firm&#13;
for grant payment of US$75,000. Each firm is eligible only once and the grants will&#13;
be given on "first-come first-serve" basis (see Annex E for operational guidelines of&#13;
the scheme)&#13;
*  The scheme would be run under term contract by a management contractor, providing&#13;
the services of an internationally-recruited management team capable of gaining the&#13;
confidence of chief executives in even Zambia's largest private firms. The contract&#13;
would probably be let to a joint operation, consisting of a local partner able to provide&#13;
local know-how and contacts, plus office and administrative support, working with a&#13;
foreign partner providing the services of one full-time internationally-recruited&#13;
Scheme manager.&#13;
*  Since eligibility criteria would be set deliberately to be simple and transparent, and&#13;
since the scheme operates first-come first-serve, approvals would not be dependent on&#13;
"technical evaluation". The approval authority would therefore be delegated to the&#13;
contractor.&#13;
The independent management contractor and the economy wide coverage aspects of the&#13;
design incorporate the lessons of the previous experience elsewhere in the world where&#13;
some productive sectors were ignored and/or the scheme's efficiency undermined by&#13;
political and bureaucratic process. The proposed grant instrument for NGOs is the first&#13;
such instrument included in matching grant schemes.&#13;
5.12  Management. The Scheme, and the management contract, would be supervised,&#13;
on behalf of GRZ, by a specially constituted Matching Grant Supervisory Committee&#13;
(MGSC), comprised of six representatives from private sector organizations and one&#13;
representative from the government. This committee has already been appointed by&#13;
GRZ. GRZ and MGSC would follow the operational guidelines outlined in Annex E.&#13;
The management contractor would be hired by MCTI on the recommendation of MGSC&#13;
according to IDA rules prior to the project effectiveness.&#13;
5.13  Reaching Very Small Firms. Special efforts have been made in developing the&#13;
scheme, so as to reach down to very small firms. Such firms would mainly be potential&#13;
users of standardised or group-oriented services. Usage of such services would be&#13;
supported. Also, the contractor would be expected to extend promotion and outreach&#13;
activities to include NGOs, local groupings of very small firms, and localised service&#13;
suppliers. In addition, NGOs and associations serving such firms would be encouraged to&#13;
take up "supply-side" grants, to help develop their delivery of support services to very&#13;
small firms. The scheme would extend "supply-side" matching grants to any private or&#13;
NGO operation wishing to use outside help to develop its service-supply capacity. The&#13;
eligibility criteria would be similar to those for demand-side grants, but here the&#13;
maximum grant per recipient would be set at US$25,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
2.    The Credit Component&#13;
5.14 Lines of Credit. The project will finance a Multi-Purpose Credit Facility (MCF)&#13;
which includes two lines of credit - the Investment Credit Facility (ICF) for long- and&#13;
medium-term loans to finance investments, and the Export Preshipment Credit Facility&#13;
(EPF) for short-term loans to finance production for exports. MCF funds, denominated&#13;
in foreign exchange, will be channeled through an Apex (wholesale financial institution)&#13;
organization to qualified commercial banks and to other financial intermediaries for on-&#13;
lending. The financial intermediaries will assume the credit risk of all loans. The credit&#13;
lines will be managed in accordance with the guidelines outlined in Annex F.&#13;
5.15  The project proposes an ICF of US$30 million and an EPF of US$10 million.&#13;
These amounts were estimated on the basis of demand expressed in extensive interviews&#13;
with the potential participating financial intermediaries (PFI) for credit lines and the&#13;
potential borrowers from the credit lines. Since the proposed ICF corresponds to only&#13;
about 2% of the total gross investment over the next three years, it is intended to&#13;
introduce long-term resources into Zambia. The proposed EPF corresponds to about 6%&#13;
of NTEs, provided that the facility recycles one and a half times per year. Given the&#13;
relative size of the credit lines vis a vis existing demand for such credit in Zambia, it is&#13;
expected that other donors and aid agencies would introduce similar instruments in&#13;
Zambia.  In this respect, KfW  of Germany has already agreed to utilize the&#13;
implementation framework of the project to provide an investment credit line of about&#13;
US$10 million with terms and conditions identical to the credit lines proposed under this&#13;
project.&#13;
5.16  Eligible Borrowers.  The lines of credit will be provided to viable private&#13;
enterprises by commercial banks and other licensed financial intermediaries. All sectors&#13;
in the Zambian economy will be eligible to borrow from MCF lines of credit excluding&#13;
real estate transactions, and pure trading activities. The participating intermediaries will&#13;
lend the funds to borrowers meeting their own risk criteria and they will be fully&#13;
responsible for repayment to the Apex lender independent of the final borrowers'&#13;
performance.&#13;
5.17  Eligible Financial Intermediaries. The Apex lending institution will evaluate&#13;
applications for participation in the program from licensed commercial banks and other&#13;
financial intermediaries. The Apex will seek IDA's approval for the eligibility of a&#13;
financial intermediary to participate in the credit lines. An important condition for&#13;
participation by commercial banks will be compliance with all Bank of Zambia&#13;
prudential regulations, as well as with the minimum capital requirements which becarne&#13;
effective at year-end 1996 (see Annex F). For other financial intermediaries (such as&#13;
investment banks and leasing companies) similar minimum capital requirement and&#13;
eligibility criteria will be established by the Apex institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
5.18  Limits for Financial Intermediaries.  For each participating intermediary&#13;
maximum amounts from both lines of credit will be established as a percentage of the&#13;
intermediary's capital as a means to minimize the aggregate financial institution's risk to&#13;
the Apex. No participating intermediary will be allowed to intermediate more than 25%&#13;
of the total amount of each line of credit even if qualified for a higher share because of&#13;
the size of its capital. Limits will be set, nevertheless, so as to generate an aggregate level&#13;
of eligibility which is much larger than the size of the lines of credit. This excess is&#13;
intended to promote competition among intermediaries for eligible borrowers. The limits&#13;
will be revised periodically to reflect the participating intermediaries' performance and&#13;
capital. During the periodic reviews, additional intermediaries may be approved (new&#13;
institutions, institutions that now meet criteria for participation which they previously&#13;
failed), and participating institution will be removed from the list if their performance has&#13;
deteriorated below the qualifying criteria. For evaluating participating intermediaries the&#13;
Apex institution will use, to the largest extent possible, the data and analysis of the BOZ&#13;
Department of Banking Supervision.&#13;
5.19   Limits for Final Borrowers. No single borrower (a firm or group of companies)&#13;
will be allowed to borrow more than 3 million US dollars under ICF and 1 million US&#13;
dollars under EPF in total from all of the participating intermediaries. These limits on&#13;
single borrowers are set to facilitate the broader participation in these facilities. No lower&#13;
limit will be established for loan size, but we expect the banks to set their individual&#13;
minimum size based on their assessment of administration costs. The interviews with&#13;
commercial banks indicate a lower limit between US$25,000 - 100,000 for EPF and&#13;
US$50,000 - 200, 000 for ICF.&#13;
5.20 General Terms and Conditions for Final Borrowers. IDA funds for MCF will&#13;
be provided to the PFIs denominated in US Dollars at a rate of interest which reflects the&#13;
international rates for US Dollars. The Rate will be equal to 12 month LIBOR plus 2%.&#13;
This rate will be adjusted annually to the prevailing 12 month LIBOR rate. The PFIs are&#13;
expected to charge the final borrowers a rate equal to their cost of funds plus a spread to&#13;
cover their administration costs and credit risk. IDA or the Apex will not dictate or limit&#13;
their spread, nor is their spread expected to be the same for all their borrowers, as the on-&#13;
lending rates for each class of borrowers should reflect the PFIs risk in lending to them.&#13;
The commercial banks interviewed by the mission indicated that their spread will be&#13;
between 2 - 4 percent. Although all the loans from the Apex to the PFIs and from the&#13;
PFIs to the final borrowers will be denominated in US Dollars, final borrowers and PFIs&#13;
will be allowed to make repayments in US Dollars or in Kwacha at the prevailing&#13;
exchange rate on the day of each payment. This will enable financial intermediaries and&#13;
final borrowers to assume the exchange rate risk without assuming a foreign exchange&#13;
availability risk. ICF loans will have a maturity of three to seven years with a grace&#13;
period of up to 18 months.  EPF will have a maturity of up to nine months.&#13;
Disbursement, and repayment schedules of PFIs to the final borrowers will be exactly&#13;
reflected into the agreement between the Apex and PFIs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
5.21  Sinking Fund. Given the maturity of the IDA credit, the maturity of the loans&#13;
provided from the MCF allows the MCF to be recycled several times until the IDA credit&#13;
matures. However, as IDA interest charges are much below international interest rates, it&#13;
is the intention of IDA and GRZ to make the MCF a perpetual facility of long-term funds&#13;
for the Zambian private sector by allocating each year part of the Apex interest income to&#13;
a sinking fund, invested in international debt instruments, which will be sufficient to&#13;
service the IDA loan repayments. With current international rates, and accounting for the&#13;
MGS of the EDP credit and for possible depreciation of the US Dollar against the SDRs&#13;
provided by IDA, the initial annual allocation to the sinking fund will be 3.25% of the&#13;
amounts disbursed. The sinking fund will be managed by the Apex with BOZ acting as a&#13;
trustee for the investment portfolio. This sinking fund arrangement would relieve GRZ&#13;
from any financial burden, provided that the Apex would take the risks of only the viable&#13;
financial intermediaries and constantly monitor the relation between each PFI's exposure&#13;
and its financial strength.&#13;
3.    Institutional Development&#13;
5.22  Scope and Components.  The project will include technical assistance&#13;
components which aim to increase institutional capacity in the financial sector and&#13;
enhance the access and quality of market related information in Zambia. This technical&#13;
assistance comprises six components:&#13;
* training for commercial banks for project evaluation and export transactions (EDP-&#13;
BANK TA);&#13;
- matching grants to commercial banks to modernize their operations (MGS-BANK);&#13;
* technical assistance to ZNCB to restructure its operations (EDP-ZNCB TA);&#13;
* technical assistance to the Apex (EDP-Apex TA)&#13;
* technical assistance for implementation of MGS (EDP-MGS TA)&#13;
* technical assistance to BOZ to enhance its supervision capabilities (EDP-BOZ TA)&#13;
and;&#13;
* technical assistance to EBZ (EDP-EBZ TA)to establish a global information data base&#13;
with modern tools.&#13;
5.23 Training Courses in Financial Sector (EDP-BANK TA). EDP-BANK TA will&#13;
be offered in the form of two one-semester training courses, one in investment evaluation&#13;
and long and medium-term lending, and the other in export financing (for more detail and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
the framework of terms of reference see Annex G). Each program will be conducted over&#13;
one three-month period, partly full time (with a component of several residential one&#13;
week intensive study periods) and partly evening classes. Such courses will be open to&#13;
all financial institutions to send senior and middle level managers; each of the 2 courses&#13;
will train between 20 and 30 participants. EDP-BANK TA program will finance the&#13;
participation of three teachers, with relevant expertise and training experience; one trainer&#13;
for each course will be a specialist in the specific area of the course, and will be&#13;
responsible for the course curriculum. The third trainer will teach more general high-&#13;
level banking subjects in both courses.  Local trainers and bankers will provide&#13;
additional, locally relevant, lectures. The Zambia Institute of Bankers has agreed to take&#13;
the responsibility for organizing and managing the training program. The local costs of&#13;
the training program will be financed by tuition fees per participant and paid by the&#13;
banks.&#13;
5.24 Matching Grant Scheme for Commercial Banks (MGS-BANK). A matching&#13;
grant scheme will be offered to support development efforts of Zambia's locally owned&#13;
commercial banks (for more detail and the framework of terms of reference see Annex G).&#13;
Zambia's commercial banking scene has a dualistic nature. On the one hand there are&#13;
commercial banks owned by multinational banks and on the other there are smaller banks&#13;
with local ownership. The first set of banks have access to their parents' facilities such as&#13;
training, expert help, operational manuals , etc. The second set of banks do not have&#13;
access to such facilities. MGS - BANK is intended to assist the locally owned banks to&#13;
modernize their operations. MGS - BANK will operate on the same basic principles as&#13;
the MGS. It will be demand-driven and the interested commercial banks will share the&#13;
costs. Total funds for MGS would be US$300,000 and the limit per grant is US$75,000.&#13;
5.25  Technical Assistance to ZNBC (EDP-ZNCB TA). The project would comply&#13;
with the request of GRZ and ZNCB management and, by providing technical assistance&#13;
to this vitally important institution for the Zambian financial markets (for more detail and&#13;
the framework of terms of reference see Annex G). This technical assistance will be in&#13;
support of the ongoing reorganization efforts. The project will finance two resident&#13;
advisors for a year to help the management in their efforts of modernizing and&#13;
restructuring the bank.&#13;
5.26  Technical Assistance to the Apex (EDP-APEX TA). The credit component of&#13;
the project requires an apex financial institution. At the moment, there is no credible&#13;
government owned institution to perform as an apex and BOZ rightly considers that&#13;
executing credit lines creates conflict of interest with its central responsibilities. GRZ is&#13;
currently trying to establish a new financial institution in Zambia to mobilize&#13;
concessionary funds and act as a wholesale bank dealing only with eligible financial&#13;
intermediaries. While GRZ is establishing the new institution which would become a&#13;
permanent apex, MCF credit lines will be executed by a private contractor who would&#13;
perform the functions of the Apex (for more detail and the framework of terms of&#13;
reference see Annex F and G). EDP -APEX TA is intended to cover the cost of such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
administration should the pace of disbursements and the fee structure of the selected&#13;
contractor necessitate additional funds. Any remaining funds could be used to assist the&#13;
new Apex organization at its start-up. The details of costing and limits explained in&#13;
Annex F and G.&#13;
5.27 Technical Assistance for MGS Implementation (EDP-MGS TA). EDP-MGS&#13;
TA will cover the costs of implementation of MGS and MGS-BANK(for more detail and&#13;
the framework of terms of reference see Annex E and G). Thus, the costs of MGS&#13;
Executor and "free hand-holding advice" feature will be covered by this component.&#13;
5.28 Technical Assistance for BOZ (EDP - BOZ TA). BOZ requested technical&#13;
assistance to finance three external advisors to support its institutional strengthening in&#13;
the areas of regulation and supervision of financial institutions as well as training courses&#13;
for its own bank supervision staff (for more detail and the framework of terms of&#13;
reference see Annex G). This technical assistance would provide support for on-site and&#13;
off-site analysis of information on banks and for the development of regulations and&#13;
circulars to support the existing prudential legislation and to enforce the existing&#13;
regulations.&#13;
5.29  Technical Assistance to Export Board of Zambia (EDP-EBZ TA). The project&#13;
will help EBZ to establish an information brokering service to serve all Zambian&#13;
businesses (for more detail and the framework of terms of reference see Annex G). This&#13;
service will be provided on a cost-recovery fee-paying basis. EBZ already provides&#13;
library access and information search services. It is planning the natural extension into&#13;
information brokering, but has so far lacked the financial resources to fund the required&#13;
investment in equipment and training. EDP-EBZ TA will support a short-program of&#13;
specialized training for a new EBZ staff member in a developed country where such&#13;
services are widely available. The EU has already pledged to provide the hardware which&#13;
can be used for the planned services.&#13;
E.    Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
5.30  The proposed IDA credit of US$45 million equivalent would finance about 86%&#13;
of the total project cost. This figure includes a contingency of US$250,000 --for both&#13;
IDA and non-IDA funded portions-- in order to accommodate unexpected total project&#13;
costs for technical assistance and administration of MGS. These cost estimates are based&#13;
on the figures provided in Section D above and in Annexes E, F, and G.&#13;
5.31  Table 9 below provides the project cost financial plan. Private firms are expected&#13;
to contribute US$7.25 million to the project. Almost all of this contribution would be for&#13;
the matching grants and credit components of the project. These contributions are&#13;
estimated based on the ten percent minimum required contribution by the participating&#13;
enterprises. Potential PFIs expressed that they would normally ask at least 20 percent&#13;
equity participation for investment projects and finance about 70 percent of export orders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
However, they indicated that they would go as low as 10 percent for equity requirement&#13;
and finance about 90 percent of export orders depending on the borrower and on the&#13;
project.&#13;

F.    Project Implementation&#13;
5.32   The project will be implemented in a de-centralized fashion, with each set of&#13;
beneficiaries responsible for the relevant project component:&#13;
&#149;  Matching Grant Supervisory Committee (MGSC), which is already appointed, would&#13;
have responsibility for oversight of the Matching Grant Scheme -- including demand-&#13;
driven technical assistance to commercial banks, which will operate on the same&#13;
principles as other matching grants to the private sector. MCTI would appoint an&#13;
independent executor for MGS on the recommendation of MGSC and supervise the&#13;
contractor within the agreed operational guidelines (as outlined in Annex D).&#13;
Announcement of the short-list (in accordance with the IDA procurement rules) for&#13;
the hiring of the contractor was a condition for negotiation. The contractor will be&#13;
hired prior to the project effectiveness.&#13;
*  A private contractor will manage the credit component until a permanent Apex is&#13;
established. A temporary Apex Committee (which is already appointed) will assume&#13;
the responsibility of overseeing the activities of the private contractor. The Apex unit&#13;
(both temporary and the permanent entities) would have the responsibilities for&#13;
ensuring the efficient onlending of funds to solvent, well-managed financial&#13;
intermediaries with capacity for onlending to private companies and exporters. The&#13;
details of the agreed Apex arrangement are presented in Annex F. Announcement of&#13;
the short-list (in accordance with the IDA procurement rules) for the hiring of the&#13;
contractor was a condition for negotiations. The contractor will be hired prior to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
project effectiveness. Technical assistance components will be channeled directly to&#13;
the relevant recipient organizations (i.e. BOZ, Zambia Institute of Bankers, Zambia&#13;
National Commercial Bank, and the Export Board of Zambia).&#13;
The Permanent Secretary of MCTI will coordinate the implementation of the project.&#13;
IDA support for implementation is critical. A significant amount of supervision will be&#13;
required especially in the start-up phase of the project.&#13;
5.33 Financial Apex. MCF will be managed by a financial apex (Apex). The Apex&#13;
will provide lines of credit to eligible financial intermediaries. Funds will be on-lent to&#13;
final beneficiaries by these intermediaries at the intermediaries' own risk. The Apex will&#13;
not assume any risk other than the risk of failures of financial intermediaries. The Apex&#13;
will determine the eligibility of financial intermediaries and their credit line limits. It will&#13;
also constantly monitor the performance of the intermediaries. In addition to this, the&#13;
Apex will be responsible for: a) managing undisbursed funds in a prudent way with&#13;
maximum income feasible; b) disbursing funds when due, without delay; and c)&#13;
collecting promptly amounts due from the participating intermediaries. The Apex will&#13;
also be responsible for updating participating intermediaries on availability of funds, and&#13;
for promoting the lines of credit when funds are available. Once the permanent Apex is&#13;
in place it will be available for managing additional lines of credit from other sources.&#13;
5.34  The Apex will provide periodic performance reports which include detailed&#13;
disbursement data, data on eligible institutions and their limits on the credit lines and&#13;
availability of funds within those limits and other related data (as explained in the annex).&#13;
These reports will officially be forwarded to the Permanent Secretary of MCTI.&#13;
5.35  Matching Grant Supervisory Committee.  rhe overall supervision and&#13;
management responsibility of the MGS will lie in the Matching Grant Supervisory&#13;
Committee (MGSC). This Committee is already appointed by the MCTI and consists of&#13;
six representatives from the private sector organizations and a member representing the&#13;
government.&#13;
5.36  MGSC will recommend the selection of independent executors, supervise them&#13;
and evaluate and submit documents to the Government.&#13;
5.37  Procurement. Procurement arrangements are summarized  in Table  10.&#13;
Procurement under sub-loans will be carried out in accordance with commercial practices&#13;
of the private sector beneficiaries, which are acceptable as per Section 3.12 of&#13;
Procurement Guidelines under IBRD Loan and IDA Credits (January 1995, Revised&#13;
January and August 1996).&#13;

NIF-Not IDA-financed. Amounts in parenthesis are the amounts IDA financed.&#13;
5.38   Technical services under matching grants expecting to cost a maximum  of&#13;
US$75,000 per grant will also be procured by the beneficiaries on competitive basis&#13;
according to the principles and guidelines outlined in Annex E (Statement of Operating&#13;
Policies and Procedures (SPOP) for MGS).&#13;
5.39   Selection and employment of consultants for the technical assistance components&#13;
will be in accordance with the guidelines on the Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997. Specifically, Quality-and-Cost-&#13;
based Selection (QCBS) guidelines will be observed for EDP - ZNCB TA and Individual&#13;
Consultant guidelines will apply for EDP- BOZ TA and EDP BANK -TA. IDA's&#13;
standard "Requests for Proposals" will be used. However, the selection process for the&#13;
MGS executor and the Apex Contractor was started under the previous IDA guidelines&#13;
(see para. 5.41 below). Nonetheless, QCBS guidelines will be followed for the remainder&#13;
of the process. A general procurement notice (GPN) was advertised in Development&#13;
Business (DB) on December 16, 1996. Selection and employment of consultants by the&#13;
final borrowers of the subloans will be in accordance with the commercial practices of the&#13;
private sector beneficiaries. For consulting contracts exceeding US$200,000 each, if any,&#13;
competitive procedures will be used.&#13;
5.40 Prior Bank/IDA review of consulting services contracts awarded by MGSC, Apex&#13;
Committee, and hiring of consultants to deliver all technical assistance financed by the&#13;
project will be required.&#13;
5.41   During the post-appraisal mission, it was agreed that the GRZ will start the&#13;
process of hiring the MGS executor and the Apex Contractor in accordance with the IDA&#13;
rules effective at the time. It was further agreed that the negotiations will take place only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
after reaching to short-list level. Following this agreement, GRZ has started the process&#13;
for hiring the MGS executor and the Apex Contractor through MGSC and the Apex&#13;
Committee. After the announcement of General Procurement Notice on December 16,&#13;
1996 issue of Development News, GRZ through the appointed committees advertised&#13;
these positions. During this process, the committees solicited the IDA comments on the&#13;
content of the advertisements and related material.  These committees evaluated&#13;
expressions of interest and concluded on the short-lists. These lists submitted to IDA for&#13;
a "no-objection" on February 18, 1997 were revised on March 4, 1997. A no-objection&#13;
note was issued on March 4, 1997. All throughout the process a procurement specialist&#13;
from the resident mission in Zambia assisted these committees to ensure the compliance&#13;
with the IDA rules.&#13;
5.42   Disbursement.  D)isbursemcnt categories and projected disbursements are&#13;
indicated in Annex 1. 1)isbursement anid withdrawal procedures are detailed in the World&#13;
Bank Disbursement Handbook (1992 edition). All disbursements are subject to the&#13;
conditions of the Development Credit Agreement and the procedures defined in the&#13;
disbursement letter. All applications to withdraw proceeds from the Credit account will&#13;
be fully docurmented. The relevant documentation for withdrawal is: (i) for matching&#13;
grants, MGS executor approved Statement of Expenditures according to policies and&#13;
procedures outlined in SPOP; (ii) for subloans under MCF, according to the contract&#13;
between the Apex and PFIs which also reflects the disbursement and repayment&#13;
schedules of the contract between PFIs and the final beneficiaries; and (iii) all other&#13;
expenditures will need a certified Statement of Expenditures by the corresponding&#13;
implementing agency except on contracts with ani estimated value of $100,000 or less for&#13;
consulting firms and $50,000 for individuals.&#13;
5.43  Special Account. A special account to be opened by GRZ will be utilized to&#13;
facilitate disbursements of eligible expenditures for goods and services. The authorized&#13;
allocation for the special account will be US$4.5 million, covering an estimated four&#13;
months of eligible expenditures financed by IDA. Upon credit effectiveness or as needed,&#13;
an amount of US$2 million would be deposited in the special account. Subsequent&#13;
deposits may be requested as needed not exceeding the total authorized amount of&#13;
US$4.5 million. Replenishment applications should be submitted regularly, preferably&#13;
monthly, after monthly bank statements are received and reconciled, with appropriate&#13;
supporting documents for eligible expenditures as required. To the extent possible, all of&#13;
IDA's share of eligible expenditures should be paid through the special account.&#13;
5.44  Audit and Reporting Requirements. All project accounts, the Special Accounts&#13;
Statement of Expenditures and financial accounts of participating financial intermediaries&#13;
will be audited at the end of each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Copies of such audit reports will be forwarded to IDA within six months at the end of&#13;
each reporting period. MGSC, and the Apex will be responsible to maintain. and to cause&#13;
to maintain, adequate records and a project information system that would provide&#13;
quarterly information on disbursements satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
5.45   Quarterly progress reports under the project will be sent to the Permanent&#13;
Secretary of MCTI and to IDA by MGSC, the Apex Committee and the implementing&#13;
agencies for the technical assistance.  These progress reports follow the guidelines&#13;
detailed in technical annexes with respect to each project component&#13;
5.46  Project Implementation Support. This project will require significant IDA&#13;
resources to support for its implementation. Implementation support missions will work&#13;
closely with implementation institutions (MGSC, independent executors, the Apex,&#13;
MCTI, technical assistance beneficiaries, financial intermediaries, final beneficiaries of&#13;
the grants and credit lines). Implementation support will be particularly extensive during&#13;
the start-up phase. A detailed implementation support plan is provided in Annex K.&#13;
5.47   Mid-Term Review. An extensive review is expected to be completed by June 30,&#13;
1999 when the estimated first cycle (first cycle is the period when all the project&#13;
components are disbursed and the loans will be recovered from the final beneficiaries&#13;
within the loan maturity) comes to mid-point. The purpose of the review would be to&#13;
assess: (i) whether the project is being implemented satisfactorily; (ii) how its design and&#13;
functions can be improved; (iii) whether and how it is achieving its objectives as&#13;
discerned through monitorable indicators; and (iv) what factors beyond the scope of the&#13;
project have affected it in achieving its objectives. Prior to the review, MCTI will be&#13;
expected to prepare a detailed report, covering areas to be agreed upon with IDA. The&#13;
particulars of the mid-term review with respect to each project component are outlined in&#13;
respective technical annexes.&#13;
5.48  Project Completion. Since the MCF facility will continue to be recycled, the&#13;
project will effectively come to close at the end of the IDA maturity. However, for all&#13;
practical purposes the project will have a closure on June, 30, 2002. At this date a&#13;
detailed Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be written and the future&#13;
reporting and monitoring requirements with respect to the sinking fund arrangement will&#13;
be decided upon.&#13;
G.    Environment.&#13;
5.49  Zambia currently has three legislations in effect with respect to environmental&#13;
protection; Water Pollution Regulations, Waste Management Law, and Pesticides and&#13;
Toxic Substances Regulations. These legislations are enforced by the Environmental&#13;
Council of Zambia (ECZ). Mining operations also require various licenses under the&#13;
Mining Act which is enforced by the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development.&#13;
Under the Water Pollution regulations all enterprises which discharge effluents need to&#13;
obtain license from ECZ.&#13;
5.50  Zambia does not have air and soil pollution regulations. There is currently a draft&#13;
of an air pollution regulation which aims at controlling emissions from stationary sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
This regulation is expected to be in effect soon. There is also a draft of EIA guidelines&#13;
which are expected to be in effect within a year. EIA regulation, when becoming&#13;
effective, will strengthen and formalize project screening for environmental impact.&#13;
5.51  This project is not expected to present any specific environmental risks, and is&#13;
therefore rated B. Sub-projects financed under the project would be required to fully meet&#13;
existing health, safety and environmental guidelines in effect at a national or a local level,&#13;
and sub-borrowers would bear the responsibility for failure to comply with such&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
H.   Project Benefits and Risks&#13;
5.52  Project Benefits. There are four main benefits from the proposed project. First,&#13;
there will be a higher level of investment. Second, ongoing reorientation efforts by&#13;
Zambian firms will be aided and facilitated. Third, Zambia's financial institutions will be&#13;
strengthened. Four, Zambian firms will be able to access world-wide business data bases&#13;
and market intelligence. These benefits will have a secondary wave of benefits through&#13;
higher levels of employment and income. The project will address directly the urban&#13;
poverty issues by creating and preserving industrial jobs. It will indirectly address the&#13;
rural poverty issues by creating demand for various agricultural crops and by supporting&#13;
entrepreneurs in agri-businesses.&#13;
5.53  Many of the project benefits are difficult to measure in advance in quantitative&#13;
terms. Nevertheless the following table give the best estimates of the economic activity&#13;
that would be generated by the project.&#13;
Table 11: Summary Benefits in Terms of Economic Activity&#13;
Project Component                      Benefit&#13;
MGS, MGS-BANK                          Injection of US$7 million- know-how in&#13;
approximately 100 firms and six&#13;
commercial banks&#13;
ICF                                    Financing estimated total of US$40 million&#13;
of sixty investment projects for each cycle&#13;
of five years&#13;
EPF                                    Financing approximately 100 export orders&#13;
with an estimated value of US$15 million&#13;
per year.&#13;
According to a net present value estimation, based on the methodology described in&#13;
Annex L, the project would generate a net present value of US$12.60 million, with 17%&#13;
economic rate of return and at 13 % discount rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5.54  Project Risks. The project's principal risks are: (i) keeping the reform policies&#13;
on track and preserving a stable macroeconomic environment; (ii) MGSC and the Apex&#13;
Committee may fail to meet their responsibilities; (iii) private contractors for the&#13;
temporary Apex and MGS may fail to function properly; (iv) the bank supervision system&#13;
may not provide timely and reliable data; and (v) alternative funding at below market&#13;
rates could be provided by the Government or from other sources which undercuts the&#13;
support of the credit component.&#13;
5.55  Mitigating Factors. The above risks were assessed by the task team and&#13;
concluded that the risks involved are acceptable based on the following mitigating&#13;
factors:&#13;
*  ongoing economic policy dialogue through the IDA adjustment operations and the&#13;
IMF program provide sufficient technical advice and financial resources; the&#13;
Government has renewed its commitment to these programs after the elections;&#13;
*  MGSC is designed to have representatives from a wide spectrum of private sector&#13;
activities. Six out of seven members of MGSC are from private sector. An MCTI&#13;
representative is also a member of the committee. Furthermore, GRZ is required: (i)&#13;
to maintain this committee throughout the implementation of MGS; (ii) to seek&#13;
mutual agreement of IDA on any change in the membership of the committee; (iii) to&#13;
cause MGSC to have periodic mandatory meetings; and (iv) to cause MGSC to&#13;
coordinate closely with the IDA implementation support missions;&#13;
*  the Apex Committee is designed to have all the involved parties in the credit lines&#13;
represented. Among these members, three key government entities for the credit line&#13;
operation are represented at a very high level: (i) Deputy Governor of BOZ, whose&#13;
supervision department is also responsible to provide data to the Apex; (ii) Director of&#13;
Loans and Investments Department of MOF, who also maintains special accounts for&#13;
this project and other IDA operations; (iii) Permanent Secretary of MCTI. In addition&#13;
to these government members three key members represent the other stakeholders,&#13;
including Deputy Chairman of Banks' Association of Zambia, Chairman of Zambia&#13;
Associations of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and one other private sector&#13;
representative. GRZ is required: (i) to maintain this committee throughout the&#13;
implementation of the credit lines; (ii) to obtain approval of IDA for any change in&#13;
the membership of the committee; (iii) to cause Apex Committee to have periodic&#13;
mandatory meetings; and (iv) to cause Apex Committee to coordinate closely with the&#13;
IDA implementation support missions;&#13;
*  both private contractors are going to be selected with IDA prior review, which&#13;
includes IDA's approval of the contract contents clearly specifying performance&#13;
criteria and operational parameters. Contracts with these contractors may be canceled&#13;
due to non-performance by MGSC and the Apex Committee with IDA's consent;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
* a technical assistance component (EDP-BOZ TA) is specifically designed to improve&#13;
the Bank Supervision Department of BOZ. This component will help to improve the&#13;
quality and timeliness of the supervision data. This component will also enable the&#13;
IDA implementation support missions to maintain effective dialogue with BOZ.&#13;
Furthermore, the presence of the Deputy Governor in the Apex Committee will&#13;
increase the attention of BOZ management to the supervision related issues and the&#13;
information needs of the Apex;&#13;
. ongoing dialogue within the donor community, increased cooperation, and&#13;
converging views on market determined interest rates will ensure that donor funded&#13;
subsidized credit will not enter into Zambia. The Task team has met and discussed&#13;
this issue with officials and representatives of the bilateral and multilateral donors.&#13;
These meetings concluded that excluding efforts to reach micro-scale entrepreneurs&#13;
occurrence of subsidized credit is not likely.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS, ASSURANCES, CONDITIONS AND&#13;
RECOMMENDATION&#13;
A.    Assurances Received During Negotiations&#13;
6.39  The following assurances were obtained at negotiations:&#13;
* MGSC, which has already adopted the SPOP (Annex E) for MGS as its operational&#13;
guidelines, will not alter the SPOP without IDA's consent;&#13;
* The Apex Committee, which has already adopted the SPOP for credit lines (Annex F)&#13;
as its operational guidelines, will not alter the SPOP without IDA's consent;&#13;
* GRZ will maintain MGSC and the Apex Committee throughout the implementation&#13;
of the related project components and obtain the IDA's consent for any change in the&#13;
already appointed committees;&#13;
* The contracts between the Apex Committee and the contractor and the PFIs will&#13;
explicitly specify that the Apex Committee is acting as an agent on behalf of MOF;&#13;
* The contract between MGSC and the MGS contractor will explicitly specify that&#13;
MGSC is acting as an agent on behalf of MCTI;&#13;
. A detailed mid-term review will be undertaken within 30 months of project&#13;
effectiveness, but no later than June 30, 2000, with significant Government and&#13;
private sector participation, and analytical inputs, and actions agreed during the&#13;
review would be implemented expeditiously, in consultation with IDA; and&#13;
. A time table, consistent with Annex J, for hiring the consultants for technical&#13;
assistance components was agreed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
B.   Condition of Effectiveness&#13;
6.40 The following would be a condition of effectiveness: MGSC and the Apex&#13;
Committee will have entered into agreements with the contractors in accordance with the&#13;
IDA rules and procedures.&#13;
C.   Condition of Disbursement&#13;
6.41  The following would be the condition for disbursement for Credit Lines: no funds&#13;
will be disbursed from the credit line component of the project unless the Apex contractor&#13;
has evaluated interested financial intermediaries and certified at least one of those&#13;
institutions as PFI with IDA's consent. Disbursement for each PFI will take place when:&#13;
(i) PFI and the Apex Contractor have signed the PFI agreement which is outlined in the&#13;
IDA approved contract between the Apex Committee and the contractor; (ii) PFI has&#13;
agreed to make a sub-loan out of MCF according to the guidelines outlined in Annex F&#13;
and adopted as the official guidelines by the contractor; and (iii) PFI has applied to the&#13;
Contractor for the sub-loan according to the principles outlined in the PFI agreement.&#13;
D.   Recommendation&#13;
6.42  On the basis of the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would&#13;
be suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 32.6 million (US$45 million equivalent).&#13;

Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
ZAMBIA&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
Statement of Policies &amp; Operating Procedures&#13;
1.    Objective &amp; Essential Concepts&#13;
1.    Objective. The Matching Grant Scheme is a component of the Enterprise De-&#13;
velopment Project, funded by the World Bank/IDA. The overall objective of the project is&#13;
assist the Government of Zambia in its efforts to develop private enterprises. The specific&#13;
objective of the Matching Grant Scheme [MGS] is to help kickstart a supply response&#13;
within private enterprises to Zambia's program of economic reforms.&#13;
2.    Three Instruments. Experience elsewhere indicates that this firm-level supply&#13;
response depends on the speed at which each firm is able to build within itself the&#13;
different skills, know-how, expertise, and market understanding required by the fast-&#13;
changing economic realities external to the firm. An effective method for building these&#13;
capacities within the firm is to buy in external business development services. The&#13;
scheme will encourage an active market in business development services by means of a&#13;
combination of three instruments.&#13;
3.    The first instrument, the core of the scheme, consists of the provisions of service&#13;
user grants. Private enterprises will receive grants to cover half the costs of using&#13;
business development services. A broad range of services is covered, including market-&#13;
ing, production and general business strategy.&#13;
4.    The second instrument consists of providing to firms free hand-holding assistance&#13;
on how to go about making the best possible use of business development services, in&#13;
order to inject the skills, know-how, etc. that will build competitiveness in the changed&#13;
and liberalised economic environment they face. This complements the first instrument. It&#13;
is intended to build confidence in entering what is for many firms the new and unknown&#13;
activity of buying business development services.&#13;
5.     The third instrument further encourages an active Zambian market in business&#13;
development services by the provision of service developer grants. Local organisations&#13;
wishing to build their capacity to supply such services to the Zambian market will receive&#13;
grants to cover half the costs of developing such services. This is intended to match the&#13;
increased demand for services with a local response on the supply side of this market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-                              Annex E&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
6. This Statement of Policies and Operating Procedures [SPOP] specifies agreements&#13;
reached under the project on exactly how the MGS is to operate.&#13;
2.    Basic Structure of the Scheme&#13;
7.    Resources. The Scheme will have available under the project a total grant fund of&#13;
US$2.5m. Grants under the scheme are to be committed within the three-year operational&#13;
period of the project. After the available grant fund under this project has been fully&#13;
disbursed, or at the time of the mid-term review, whichever is sooner, a decision will be&#13;
taken as to possible further funding for the scheme.&#13;
8.    Additional Special-Purpose Sub-Funds. The $300,000 sub-fund for assistance&#13;
to banks is described separately in para. 5.23 of the SAR. IDA-funded projects in&#13;
agriculture and construction, plus others, may at a later date provide special-purpose&#13;
sub-funds, to be administered within the scheme, but to target specific groups of private&#13;
enterprises [ea. farmers, construction contractors], and to motivate specific activities [ea.&#13;
rehabilitation of construction equipment]. Special policies and operating procedures will&#13;
be developed for these sub-funds, as needed. However, these will be consistent with the&#13;
objectives and essential concepts described in this document.&#13;
9.    Level. Each individual grant to a recipient firm must be matched 50/50 by an&#13;
equal contribution by the firm itself. No preferential rates of support will be given to&#13;
particular sectors, types of service, firm size, firm category, or region. However, since the&#13;
scheme is deliberately designed to be demand-driven, the actual demand at the 50%&#13;
support level is, by its very nature, uncertain. This 50% level will therefore be reviewed&#13;
regularly, and may be reduced by recommendation of the Supervisory Committee, subject&#13;
to IDA approval.&#13;
10.   Supervisory Committee. The scheme will be supervised, on behalf of the&#13;
Government of Zambia, by a specially-constituted supervisory committee, consisting of&#13;
seven members. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Trade, acting for the&#13;
Government, has already appointed this committee. The committee consists of seven&#13;
members with six members of the committee representing the private sector and one&#13;
member representing the government.  The Government agreed to maintain this&#13;
composition within the committee so as to allow a wide ownership of the project by the&#13;
private sector. The representatives of the private sector nominated by the various private&#13;
sector organizations. However, these members will act in their individual capacities and&#13;
have the fudiciary responsibility to all the sectors. The current members were nominated&#13;
by ZACCI, ZAM, SIAZ, TAZ, ZEGA and Lusaka Chambers of Commerce.&#13;
11.   Initial Committee Responsibility. The first task of the supervisory board will be&#13;
to approve this SPOP. Once then endorsed by the IDA, this SPOP will then direct the&#13;
operation of the scheme.&#13;
&#13;

-43-                                Annex E&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
12.   Management Contract. The whole scheme, including its three instruments, will&#13;
be run under a term contract by a management contractor, providing the services of one&#13;
internationally-recruited scheme manager, to be backed up by local office support,&#13;
providing local contacts, office facilities plus accounting and treasury services. It is&#13;
expected that the contractor would also be able to provide linkages to overseas&#13;
organizations useful for sourcing specialist service providers.  The Government of&#13;
Zambia, as recipient of IDA funding, will be responsible for selecting and appointing the&#13;
contractor, by means of competitive tender. The contract will specify, amongst other&#13;
details, the arrangements to be made by the contractor for dealing with an expected lag of&#13;
disbursements after approvals of around six months.&#13;
13.   Supervisory Arrangements. The scheme manager will submit to the supervisory&#13;
board annual work plans, followed by quarterly progress reports detailing achievement of&#13;
these work plans. The initial work plan will detail specific activities aimed at achieving&#13;
wide publicity and exposure for the scheme, to make its benefits known to as many&#13;
potential users as possible. The supervisory board meeting schedule will link into the&#13;
IDA project implementation support schedule, as defined in Annex K of the SAR.&#13;
Normally, the board will meet once each calendar quarter.&#13;
3.    Eligibility Criteria for Grant Support&#13;
14.   This section of the SPOP defines "eligible firm," "eligible business development&#13;
plan," "eligible activity," and "eligible expenditures.""&#13;
15.   The Eligible Firm. For service user grants, only private firms are eligible.&#13;
Parastatals, government entities and other firms where the government or its agencies&#13;
have effective management control, by means of being the largest shareholder, or by&#13;
means of having a board majority, are not eligible. Firms in all manufacturing and&#13;
services sectors of the economy are eligible, with the following restrictions. Private firms&#13;
that undertake farming are eligible, so long as they are involved in activities that add&#13;
value beyond the farm gate [ea. packing of flowers for export, processing of coffee].&#13;
16.   For service development grants, any legal entity not receiving government&#13;
funding towards its regular operating costs is eligible. This is intended to include business&#13;
and industry associations, developing services to sell to their members, and to include&#13;
NGO's, developing services to sell to their target groups of businesses.&#13;
17.   For commercial bank grants, any commercial bank established in Zambia with&#13;
full compliance to all prudential laws and regulations and has no affiliation to any&#13;
international bank is eligible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-                              Annex E&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
18.   The Eligible Business Development Plan. To be eligible for grant support, the&#13;
essential criterion is that the applicant firm must have written down a realistic plan for the&#13;
development of its business activities, taking it from its present situation to some planned&#13;
future situation, representing a positive development for the firm and its economic health.&#13;
Except in the case of MGS-BANK, there is no requirement that the specifics of the plan&#13;
are to be "approved" or vetted by any expert or committee. However, the plan must&#13;
demonstrate that the firm has properly considered the following essential planning issues:&#13;
* why one particular development direction was chosen instead of others; on what&#13;
assumptions this direction depends; and why this development direction can be&#13;
considered realistic and achievable;&#13;
*  what steps are required for that development;&#13;
*  what resources are likely to be needed within these steps, and where will they&#13;
come from;&#13;
*  how long will the process take; and what benefits are to be expected.&#13;
The degree of detail required in a particular application will depend on the size and&#13;
complexity of the application. A small firm applying for a $50 grant to send an employee&#13;
on a short technical course would, for instance, only be expected to submit a one-page&#13;
plan, explaining how such an activity could reasonably be expected to benefit the planned&#13;
development of the business. In contrast, a large firm applying for a grant of $50,000&#13;
would be expected to address all the above points in considerable detail.&#13;
19.   Plans for Service Development Grants. In the particular case of grants for&#13;
service development, the scheme will support the development of new or existing&#13;
services aimed at assisting client firms in areas relevant to business development. In this&#13;
context, a plan should, in addition to the general requirements, demonstrate that the&#13;
services to be developed are likely to be saleable, and are likely to assist the target group&#13;
of firms in developing their businesses. (For instance, an NGO developing knitting&#13;
courses for rural women would probably not be supported, unless it could be&#13;
demonstrated that it was targeting women who intended to undertake this activity on a&#13;
commercial basis, and that it was addressing their needs in basic business skills. An&#13;
NGO developing a service to assist village businesses in applying for loans probably&#13;
would be eligible, once it could be demonstrated that this was indeed a binding constraint&#13;
on the present development of these target businesses).&#13;
20.   Pre-investment Studies. In the particular case of support for pre-investment&#13;
work, the requirement that the plan be realistic will mean that, additionally, the applicant&#13;
should demonstrate a capacity to raise the level of funding likely to be required. So, for&#13;
instance, a promoter of a multi-million investment proposal, having resources for equity&#13;
capital of only a few thousand would not be supported with a grant. The proportion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-                              Annex E&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
funds being utilised for pre-investment studies will be carefully monitored (see para. 42.).&#13;
If over-usage of funds for pre-investment studies becomes a concern, this SPOP may be&#13;
modified to curb, or even eliminiate, further approvals for this purpose (see para. 51. on&#13;
amending this SPOP).&#13;
21.   One Plan per Firm. Grants are intended to motivate new behaviours. They are&#13;
therefore deliberately temporary. Once one eligible plan had been implemented, the firm&#13;
concerned would thereafter receive no further grant support. Any further usage made by&#13;
the firm of support services would have to be paid for at full market prices. However, free&#13;
hand-holding advice could continue assisting such firms throughout the duration of the&#13;
scheme.&#13;
22.   The Eligible Activity. Any usage of an external service which is charged for, and&#13;
which can reasonably be expected to contribute to the achievement of an eligible business&#13;
development plan, itself will constitute an eligible activity. The following examples of&#13;
service activities that would normally be eligible under this definition are provided purely&#13;
for guidance. The list is not intended to be exhaustive.&#13;
-  In-factory consultancy and short-term contract management services, say up to&#13;
six months in duration per introduced expert, would normally be eligible, but new&#13;
permanent staff appointments would not. The length of time for which temporary&#13;
contract management could be supported would depend on a case being made as&#13;
to how long the required transfer of know-how, skills, etc. could reasonably be&#13;
expected to take.&#13;
-  Consultancy or short-term contract management assistance directed specifically&#13;
at improving labour productivity or yields on raw materials would normally be&#13;
eligible.&#13;
*  Assistance in improving in-house capabilities in design-related techniques such&#13;
as pattern-making, prototyping, grading, sizing, counter-sampling, etc., would&#13;
normally be eligible. Buying in a set of designs for one season only, with no&#13;
longer-term enhancements aimed for, would normally not.&#13;
* The expenses of exposure tours for factory personnel, to view alternative techniques&#13;
and technologies in factories elsewhere would normally be eligible, as would market&#13;
exploration tours by marketing personnel, to explore new export market&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
23.   The Three Typical Stages of a Plan. Typically, a plan aimed at, say, expanding&#13;
sales might take a firm through these three stages: (This is provided for guidance, but is&#13;
not a requirement for eligibility)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
* investigation of the target market, be it domestic or foreign, typically starting with&#13;
desk research or limited phone research, followed then by field interviewing, either&#13;
carried out by the firm's staff or by an outside service supplier;&#13;
* supply package adaptation, on the basis of information collected from the market, in&#13;
order to bring what is being supplied presently into line with customer preferences,&#13;
and to meet existing competition; for instance through changes in product design,&#13;
rationalising production to reduce costs, or through improved quality assurance;&#13;
* active selling' with the adaptation completed, of the improved supply package.&#13;
24.   Reaching  the Very  Small Firms. Very small firms can usually  only&#13;
economically justify very small usages of business development services. Usually, the&#13;
simpler and smaller the business, the less it can economically benefit from buying in&#13;
specialist know-how, skills, etc. Under the scheme, very small firms are expected to make&#13;
use primarily of standardised and group-targeted services [e.g. open training courses],&#13;
rather than bespoke services [e.g. in-factory consultancy]. It is expected that the scheme&#13;
will reach them primarily through the efforts of business associations and NGO's. These&#13;
efforts will be supported directly by means of service development grants to such&#13;
associations and NGO's, and indirectly by means of service user grants to the buyers of&#13;
their services.&#13;
25.   Defined Deliverables from an Eligible Activity. For each eligible activity for&#13;
which grant support is being sought, the firm concerned will be expected to define at least&#13;
one "deliverable," the sight of which will verify that the activity had indeed taken place,&#13;
as described. Depending on the circumstance, a defined deliverable might consist, for&#13;
instance, of a detailed engineering drawing, or a prototype, incorporating quality&#13;
improvements; a set of standard times developed for a production process, against which&#13;
productivity could be assessed; or an externally commissioned market report. Normally, a&#13;
deliverable would consist of an output produced for good reasons anyhow under the&#13;
contract between buyer and seller of services, rather than an output produced solely for&#13;
verification purposes.&#13;
4.    Eligible Expenditures.&#13;
26.   Service Usage Costs. Expenditures on service fees, and expenditures on travel&#13;
and incidental expenses charged at cost, incurred wholly and exclusively on an eligible&#13;
activity, will be eligible for 50% grant support. Salaries for staff employed by the&#13;
supported firm are not eligible, nor are recurrent costs such as royalty fees. No expendi-&#13;
tures on hardware can be supported, even in cases where equipment or instrumentation&#13;
purchases constitute a significant expenditure within a firm-level plan. (Note that&#13;
subsidies on hardware purchases tend to be more sensitive to countervailing action by&#13;
trading partners than is cost-sharing on business development services)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-                              Annex E&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
27.   Limits per Recipient. No single recipient firm may receive total service user&#13;
grants in excess of a cumulative limit of US$75,000. No single recipient entity may&#13;
receive total service development grants in excess of a cumulative limit of US$25,000. In&#13;
case of commercial banks the limit per bank is set at US$50,000. These limits would be&#13;
reviewed were additional resources to become available to the scheme over and above the&#13;
initial US$2.5m for general MGS and US$300,000 for MGS-BANK.&#13;
28.   Exclusion. Expenditures on services provided by the firm  undertaking the&#13;
management contract to run the MGS, or by associated firms, will not be eligible for&#13;
support.&#13;
29.   Supplier Selection. The choice of service supplier will be made by the recipient&#13;
firm, and will not be restricted to suppliers on any central register. However, the&#13;
management unit will seek to satisfy themselves as to the supplier's competence for the&#13;
task intended, and that there is a genuine arms-length commercial relationship between&#13;
supplier and user.&#13;
30.   Over-Charging and Collusion. The MGS management unit will also seek to&#13;
satisfy themselves that fee rates being charged for services are broadly in line with market&#13;
realities, particularly in a case where the service supplier is not previously known to the&#13;
management unit. In exceptional cases, where the management unit has real grounds for&#13;
suspecting over-charging or collusion, grant support can be made conditional on an&#13;
acceptable process of competitive bidding between at least three technically qualified&#13;
contenders.&#13;
S.    The Recipient's Contribution&#13;
31.   Applications for grant support are accepted on the explicit understanding that the&#13;
recipient entity will match the 50% grant contribution from the scheme with an equal&#13;
50% contribution from its own resources. This is to ensure a strong sense of ownership&#13;
remains with the recipient, and a strong motivation to obtain value for money in the&#13;
recipient's own terms from the activity supported.&#13;
32.   Group Activities. Group service-using activities covering more than one firm, for&#13;
instance those sponsored by trade associations or suppliers of services, will be supported.&#13;
But applications will be evaluated separately for each individual firm. In particular, in&#13;
order to ensure commitment by each supported firm, grant support will have to be&#13;
matched by a direct 50% contributions by each participating firm to the costs of&#13;
providing group-based services to that particular firm. Service user grants could not be&#13;
provided to match contributions from association funds or public funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-                              Annex E&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
33.   Avoiding Double Subsidies. Similarly, usage of non-commercial service&#13;
suppliers will be on the basis that double subsidising of activities is to be avoided. In such&#13;
cases, grants will be calculated so that the total subsidy element from all sources external&#13;
to the firm does not exceed 50%.&#13;
6.    Processing the Individual Grant&#13;
34.   Approval of Applications. The scheme manager will be delegated the authority&#13;
to approve all applications (except for MGS-BANK) for grant support that meet the&#13;
eligibility criteria specified in this SPOP. The Scheme manager will seek IDA's no-&#13;
objection for grants to commercial banks funded under MGS-BANK.&#13;
35.   Rejections. Since virtually no technical evaluation is required in the approvals&#13;
process, and since all eligibility criteria are designed to involve straightforward yes-or-no&#13;
decisions, outright rejections are expected to be rare. However, any rejections of&#13;
proposals are to be delivered in person to the firm concerned by the scheme manager, to&#13;
give an opportunity for discussion of possible next steps. The intention is that every&#13;
applicant will be given the maximum opportunity and assistance required to enable it to&#13;
benefit from the scheme.&#13;
36.   Role of Supervisory Committee. All approvals and rejections by the scheme&#13;
manager will be considered by the next meeting of the supervisory board ex-post, to&#13;
allow it to give guidance on future approvals policy, where needed. The board may only&#13;
revoke an approval already granted by the scheme manager in the event that false or&#13;
misleading information is determined by the board to have been provided within an&#13;
application. Any such case is to be reported in detail to the IDA within one week of the&#13;
board decision.&#13;
7.    Monitoring Compliance&#13;
37.   Letter of Agreement. On receiving approval for grant support, each recipient will&#13;
be required to sign a letter of agreement. This will bind the recipient to present defined&#13;
deliverables for viewing by the management unit. The unit will have the right to view&#13;
deliverables, but not to take them off the client firm's premises, nor to take copies or&#13;
photographs. All outputs from supported activities will remain the exclusive property of&#13;
the supported firm, with commercial confidentiality fully preserved. Contractor staff will&#13;
respect the commercial confidentiality of all deliverables, outputs and information&#13;
supplied during contact with the firm.&#13;
38.   Supporting Documentation. The letter of agreement will also bind the recipient&#13;
to back up all claims for the reimbursement of half of eligible expenditures with receipted&#13;
invoices/vouchers for all fees and incidental expenses covered, so as to enable the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-                              Annex E&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
management unit to verify that the expenditures had indeed been made. This&#13;
documentation, plus the agreed deliverables, must be retained for possible inspection by&#13;
auditors or IDA supervision missions for three years after each receipt of a grant.&#13;
39.   Impact Data. The letter of agreement will also bind the recipient to provide&#13;
continuing sales revenue data, sufficient to track the direct impact of the grant support on&#13;
the enhanced competitiveness of the firm, and thus to monitor the achievement by the&#13;
scheme of its impact target. The letter will also commit the recipient to co-operate fully&#13;
with the annual financial and operational audits and the sample surveys to be conducted&#13;
later to evaluate impact. Each recipient will also be obliged to complete, after each&#13;
supported activity, a brief one-page "feedback form," indicating the level of client satis-&#13;
faction achieved by the service supplier.&#13;
8.    Grant Payment&#13;
40.   Basis of Payment.  Payment of grants will be on a re-imbursement basis,&#13;
conditional on sight of defined deliverables, and of receipted invoices/vouchers for&#13;
eligible expenditures, certified by a legal representative of the firm.&#13;
41.   Authorization. Payments of grants out of the MGS Special Account to be set up&#13;
for the purpose will require three signatures: that of the scheme manager, plus those of&#13;
two supervisory board members.&#13;
9.    Monitoring Scheme &amp; Contractor Performance&#13;
42.   Indicators. Scheme and contractor performance during the period will be&#13;
evaluated primarily with respect to activities carried out, based on annual work plans&#13;
approved in advance by the supervisory board. Scheme impact will be evaluated&#13;
primarily with respect to eventual incremental annual sales revenue achieved per unit of&#13;
grant. The target set for the scheme is that, for every US$1 spent on grants, supported&#13;
firms achieve incremental and continuing annual sales revenues, directly attributable to&#13;
scheme support, of US$2/year, and that this impact be discemable within one year of&#13;
grant receipt. In other words, the scheme aims for a 200% p.a. return on grants in terms&#13;
of revenue.&#13;
43.   Contractor Performance. As part of the contract, the management contractor&#13;
will be committed to develop, and obtain board approval of, an annual work plan for each&#13;
twelve-month period of operation of the contract. This will specify in detail the activities&#13;
to be carried out in order to launch and promote the scheme, and to manage it under the&#13;
terms of this manual. The work plan will specify the man-day inputs for each activity,&#13;
and the individual responsibilities within the contractor's team. It will also specify the&#13;
number of approvals and disbursements expected for each quarter, and will specify what&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-                              Annex E&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
is to be done, in each quarter, to assess the ongoing impact of the scheme. It will&#13;
elaborate in addition how the contractor intends to reach smaller firms and firms in&#13;
outlying areas [see para. 45]. Progress made in achieving this plan, plus modifications&#13;
proposed to the plan, would be reported to the board for each operational quarter, to be&#13;
submitted within 10 days of the end of each operational quarter. Modifications would&#13;
then have to be agreed with the board. The quarterly report will elaborate in detail on all&#13;
planned activities and indicators, giving variances and reasons.  It would analyse&#13;
approvals for the period, and cummulatively, by industry, by region, by type of activity&#13;
supported, and by firm size.&#13;
44.   Contractor Financial Standing. The contractor will be expected to present to&#13;
the Supervisory Committee, ahead of each twelve-month operating period, evidence of&#13;
continuing good financial standing as a company, usually in the form of an auditor's&#13;
opinion on annual business accounts. This evidence will also be required ahead of&#13;
contract signing.&#13;
45.   Contract Termination. In the event that the contractor fails to perform to the&#13;
satisfaction of the Supervisory Committee and/or IDA, the contract may be terminated by&#13;
the Supervisory Committee at any time, giving one month's notice, and subject to the&#13;
prior approval for the move by IDA. In addition, the contract may be terminated if, after&#13;
two years of full operation, the demand for scheme support is substantially less than an-&#13;
ticipated. Specifically, if approvals in the first two years of full operation fail to reach&#13;
50% of the funds available in the scheme, the contract and the scheme itself may be&#13;
terminated, again subject to IDA approval.&#13;
46.   Final Impact Survey. The comprehensive evaluation of scheme impact will be&#13;
carried out by means of a sample survey of recipient firms, one year after the final grant&#13;
disbursement, but to be completed no later than five months after project closing date.&#13;
This timing would enable the results to be incorporated into the Implementation&#13;
Completion Report for the project. The survey will be contracted out by the board to an&#13;
independent specialist, this choice to be approved in advance by the IDA. The survey will&#13;
include comprehensive site visits to a minimum of 10% of recipients, and will seek not&#13;
only to evaluate direct incremental impact on sales revenue, but also to gather&#13;
information on indirect impact, such as on customer orientation, quality assurance,&#13;
continuing product development, employee motivation, company image. It will also&#13;
specifically seek to evaluate the level of satisfaction firms express with respect to the&#13;
service quality provided by the contractor, and will also seek to evaluate the willingness&#13;
of firms to continue using specialist services after scheme support, at full market prices.&#13;
47.   Interim Impact Survey. Although the final impact survey will allow all stake-&#13;
holders to evaluate properly the eventual impact of the scheme, these stake-holders will&#13;
also require an interim evaluation somewhat earlier. A project-wide mid-term review is&#13;
planned for latest June 30, 1999. At least one month prior to the review, the supervisory&#13;
board is to furnish a detailed report on the progress to date with the scheme. The board&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-                              Annex E&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
will therefore conduct a smaller representative interim sample survey, to achieve an&#13;
interim evaluation of impact within this report. This, too, will be carried out by an&#13;
independent specialist, but will be based on only around ten site visits.&#13;
48.   Outreach &amp; Promotion. Contractor performance in meeting one of the key&#13;
challenges of the scheme, namely reaching out effectively to the smaller potential client&#13;
firms, and those in outlying areas, will be monitored particularly carefully by the board.&#13;
(It is anticipated that the contractor will mount several launch workshops in business&#13;
centres around the country, followed by regular follow-up workshops around the country&#13;
targeting NGO's and local associations or groupings of firms).&#13;
10.   Accounts &amp; Audit Procedures&#13;
49.   Project Account. MGSC will open a project account which will receive funds&#13;
from project's special account for the expenditures authorized under MGS and MGS-&#13;
BANK. The payments for the executor's fee will also be made out of this account.&#13;
50.   Auditing.  The MGS scheme will require an annual financial audit by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the IDA, with certified copies of audited accounts to&#13;
be submitted within six months of each fiscal year. In addition to their normal financial&#13;
verification work, the auditors will be required to verify that the quarterly operational&#13;
reports provided by the contractor represent a true and fair representation of activities&#13;
undertaken and results so far achieved. The scheme will also require an annual opera-&#13;
tional audit, to assess whether objectives are being met, and procedures respected.&#13;
Appointment of contractors for these operational audits, plus the form and Terms of&#13;
Reference are again to be satisfactory to the IDA. The supervisory committee will&#13;
therefore propose, ahead of scheme start-up, these audit details, and submit them to the&#13;
IDA, for approval.&#13;
51.   Management Accounts and Records. Administration of the scheme by the&#13;
management unit will require detailed internal record-keeping for management purposes.&#13;
However, internal record-keeping arrangements will need to be approved as acceptable to&#13;
both the appointed financial and operational audit contractors. To allow the management&#13;
unit to function effectively, these arrangements will be submitted to the audit contractors&#13;
within three months after scheme start-up, with agreement on acceptable arrangements to&#13;
be concluded at the latest one month after submission. In the event of delays, or failure to&#13;
agree, the supervisory committee will have the authority to approve record-keeping&#13;
arrangements as being acceptable for audit purposes.&#13;

11.   Amendments to this Manual&#13;
52.   This manual may be modified as required, so as to achieve the objective of the&#13;
scheme, but only by recommendation of the supervisory board, with subsequent endorse-&#13;
ment by the IDA. The manual should seek to preserve a balance between achieving the&#13;
objectives of the scheme and minimising leakage on the one hand, and preserving&#13;
simplicity, automaticity and transparency in the approvals and supervision process on the&#13;
other.&#13;

Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
ZAMBIA&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
Statement of Policies and Operating Procedures&#13;
1.    Introduction. The Credit lines of the Multi-Purpose Credit Facility (MCF) are to&#13;
provide financing through commercial banks and other licensed private financial&#13;
institutions to enterprises in the form of medium- and long-term credit for investment as&#13;
well as a short-term credit line for the production of exports. The expectation is that by&#13;
alleviating the financial constraint to enterprises, many can grow on a sustainable basis&#13;
and thus generate exports and employment. This Statement of Policies and Operating&#13;
Policies (SPOP) specifies agreements reached under the project on exactly how MCF is&#13;
to operate.&#13;
1.    Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
2.    Objective. Any form of term finance is severely limited in Zambia. More&#13;
specifically, uncertainty and the term structure of interest rates denominated in Kwacha&#13;
have led to limited and prohibitively priced credit options for financial institutions to&#13;
fund the investment and permanent working capital needs of their customers. The&#13;
commercial banks have also refrained from using foreign exchange denominated deposits&#13;
for lending purposes (such as against export orders) due to uncertainty of the permanence&#13;
of such funds. Foreign exchange deposits have been interest insensitive in terms of&#13;
maturity structure and the deposit holders have been anxious to ask the banks to transfer&#13;
these amounts to overseas on any development that might erode the confidence in the&#13;
openness of capital and current account transactions. Other factors beyond this project's&#13;
scope that have contributed to constraints on institutional finance include a decline in&#13;
financial institution lending to the private sector reflecting limited aggregate demand for&#13;
credit due to high interest rates and higher risk free returns on GRZ Treasury Bills.&#13;
3.    This component would provide two credit facilities aggregating US$40 million to&#13;
an Apex institution which would on-lend the funds to qualifying retail intermediaries.&#13;
The line of credit for terms loans would aggregate US$30 million whereas the other line&#13;
for export production would aggregate US$10 million.  The Apex institution's&#13;
assumption of credit risk would be confined to the retail intermediaries, whose eligibility&#13;
and participation would be monitored according to guidelines established in the Project&#13;
and in cooperation with the Bank of Zambia's Department of Bank Supervision. The&#13;
retail intermediaries, in turn, would assume the credit risk associated with enterprises&#13;
accessing the sub-loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-                              Annex F&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
4.    Apex Institution.   An Apex Financial Institution would be needed to manage&#13;
MCF. The Government is currently in the process of creating such an institution. In&#13;
order to expedite the project's implementation, a temporary arrangement was agreed to as&#13;
explained in Section II of this SPOP. The temporary arrangement will transfer all of its&#13;
portfolio and operations and cease to exist when the permanent apex whose&#13;
capitalization, organizational structure, and staffing were found to be satisfactory by IDA&#13;
is established.&#13;
5.    The organization and terms of reference of the Apex would ensure adequate&#13;
internal capacity to appraise commercial banks and other financial institutions in order to&#13;
determine their creditworthiness, and hence their eligibility to borrow funds from the&#13;
Facility. The Apex would ensure such capacity by accessing on a periodic basis data&#13;
collected by the regulatory authorities as well as published data. The Apex would&#13;
evaluate applications for participation in the Facility from all licensed commercial banks&#13;
and other licensed financial intermediaries. In the case of commercial banks, compliance&#13;
with BOZ prudential regulations as well as meeting the minimum capital requirements&#13;
scheduled to become effective at year-end 1996 would be minimum conditions for&#13;
participation. In the case of other financial intermediaries, including investment banks&#13;
and leasing companies, similar minimum capital requirements and additional criteria for&#13;
participation would be established by the Apex. To avoid un-prudent risks, the Apex will&#13;
limit the maximum exposure to any PFI to one time the PFI's capital (first plus second&#13;
tier). The standard loan agreements between the Apex and the PFIs will also include (i)&#13;
repayment by the PFIs of all amounts due, without reference to the final borrower actual&#13;
repayment; and (ii) the Apex right to the commitments and collateral of the all the final&#13;
borrowers in case the PFIs fails to make repayments as scheduled.&#13;
6.    Operational Guidelines. Chart 1 below summarizes operational guidelines of&#13;
the credit lines. The general operational guidelines involving PFIs are explained in detail&#13;
in Section II (Institutional Arrangements and Guidelines)&#13;

the PFIs to the borrowing  with the final borrower) at the exchange rate on the day of payment.&#13;
enterprises&#13;
Application Requirements  Application by the PFIs to the Apex would be a summary form providing data&#13;
for sub-loans             on the name, size and sector of the enterprise and nature of the sub-loan,&#13;
including percentage of total investment of activity financed, disbursement&#13;
schedule, loans duration, grace periods granted and the repayment schedule.&#13;
Detailed financial loan application data and analysis would not be included.&#13;
Applications from the borrowing enterprise to the PFI would be at the&#13;
discretion of the PFI, subject to BOZ and other prudential regulations.&#13;
Applications of PFIs will also contain a consent letter to BOZ which indicates&#13;
that they forego any confidentiality requirement imposed on BOZ with respect&#13;
to releasing any information about their financial position to Apex as long as&#13;
the loan was not fully repaid or PFI maintains an operational credit line with&#13;
the Apex.&#13;
Eligible Sectors          All sectors excluding pure agricultural activities for which there exists current&#13;
IDA financed facilities and pure trading and speculative real estate&#13;
transactions.   Purchase or take-over of existing businesses, including&#13;
privatization of parastatals will also be excluded.&#13;
Eligible Expenditures    The Apex would not finance the refinancing of existing loans by the borrowers&#13;
to the PFIs. Enterprises with non-performing loans in any PFI could not be&#13;
granted loans under the Facility.&#13;
Audit Requirements        *  Apex accounts audited an-nually by CPAs acceptable to IDA, subject to&#13;
additional random checks;&#13;
*  Random ex-post reviews of individual sub-loans to assess compliance&#13;
with procurement and disbursement requirements&#13;
PFIs must submit their audited annual reports and quarterly reports to the&#13;
Apex.&#13;
Procurement              Procurement according to IDA guidelines as per para. 5.37 and 5.39.&#13;
Disbursement              In order to ensure that the Apex will have funds to disburse promptly, the&#13;
Apex will submit a cash-flow projection to IDA, after review by GRZ not&#13;
later than the middle of each month for the next month. The government&#13;
will request from IDA that the Special Account be replenished accordingly.&#13;
Interest Rate Charged by  PFIs would be fully free to charge a rate commensurate with the costs and&#13;
PFIs to sub-borrowers    risks of sub-loans.&#13;

Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
A. Investment Line of Credit&#13;
Maturity of Sub-loans    Enterprises are expected to borrow for investment in fixed assets. The PFI&#13;
would be required to borrow from the Apex at the same maturity as the&#13;
funds to be on-lent to firms. The maturity of individual sub-loans would&#13;
range between 3 and 7 years, at the discretion of the PFIs.&#13;
Grace period             6-17 months, to be limited to one fifth of the duration of the sub-loan.&#13;
Accrued interest may be charged during the grace period or be added to the&#13;
principal during the grace period. The granting of the grace period, and the&#13;
treatment of interest is left to the discretion of the PFIs.&#13;
Maximum Sub-loan Size    US$3 million, subject to periodic change as prescribed by the Apex in&#13;
consultation with IDA. This limit applies to a loan to either one enterprise&#13;
or to one group of enterprises. This limit applies to a loan intermediated by&#13;
one PFI or by a syndicate of PFIs as well as to total borrowing by one group&#13;
from all PFIs. One enterprise or one gorup of enterprises may borrow for&#13;
differrent purposes provided that their outstanding loan balance with the&#13;
facility does not exceed US$3 million.&#13;
Minimum Contribution by  At the discretion of the financial intermediary, but, at a minimum, at least&#13;
Sub-Borrower             10% of the investment financed.&#13;
Sub-Loan Documentation   Each sub-loan would require a project summary to be submitted by the PFI&#13;
to the Apex containing, at a minimum, the following information: (i) Name&#13;
and address of borrower; (ii) sector of enterprise; (iii) number of employees;&#13;
(iv) description of financing and sub-project; and (v) the maturity and term&#13;
of financing; (vi) disbursement and repayment schedules. The Apex will not&#13;
conduct any feasibility analysis of the sub-projects and will accept the PFI's&#13;
assessment.&#13;
Environmental Impact     Sub-loans to finance green-field projects will be made only after securing&#13;
necessary licenses required by the existing laws and regulations. Sub-loans&#13;
which will finance activities of existing manufacturing companies will be&#13;
made subject to the sub-borrower's representation that the company is&#13;
currently in compliance with the existing environmental regulations.&#13;
B. Export Pre-Shipment Line of Credit&#13;
Maturity of Sub-loans    Enterprises could use funds for working capital to expand production to&#13;
meet firm export orders. The PF1 would be required to on-lend at the same&#13;
maturity as the funds it borrowed from the Apex. The maturity of individual&#13;
sub-loans would range between 3 and 9 months and would be repaid lump-&#13;
sum from the export revenue.&#13;
Grace Period             None&#13;
Maximum Sub-loan Size    US$1 million, subject to periodic change as prescribed by the Apex in&#13;
consultation with IDA. This limit applies to a loan to either one enterprise&#13;
or to a group of enterprises. This limit applies to a loan intermediated by one&#13;
PFI or by a syndicate of PFIs as well as to total borrowing by one group&#13;
from all PFIs. One enterprise or one group of enterprises may borrow to&#13;
finance different export transactions provided that their outstanding loan&#13;
balance with the facility does not exceed US$1 million.&#13;
&#13;

Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
Minimum Contribution by  As determnined by the financial intermediary, but, at a minimum, at least&#13;
Sub-Borrower             10% of the cost of producing the financed export order.&#13;
Sub-Loan Documentation   Each sub-loan would require a summary of the export order to be submitted&#13;
by the PFI to the Apex containing, at a minimum, the following information:&#13;
(i) Name and address of borrower; (ii) sector of enterprise; (iii) number of&#13;
employees; and (vi) a maturity of the sub-loan. The Apex will not conduct&#13;
any feasibility analysis of the sub-projects and will accept the PFI's&#13;
assessment.&#13;
C. Revolving Fund Arranger-ent&#13;
Sinking Fund             From the Interest charged by the Apex to the PFIs an amount will be&#13;
allocated to create a sinking fund. The sinking fund will be managed by the&#13;
Apex, with BOZ acting as trustee in such a way that the annual allocations&#13;
and the interest earned on the investments in the international capital&#13;
markets will be sufficient to cover all payments due to IDA on the EDP loan&#13;
(including the grant element). With current interest rates at around 5%, a&#13;
sinking fund allocation of 3.25% will cover all payments to IDA, including a&#13;
reserve for Dollar/SDR rate of exchange reserve and the grant element. The&#13;
residual interest income of the Apex after allocations to the sinking fund and&#13;
the allocation for Apex administration will be recycled for additional&#13;
lending at the same terms and conditions as above.&#13;
Repayment of Principal To be financed from the Sinking Fund&#13;
and Service Charges on&#13;

upon full repayment of the&#13;
IDA Credit&#13;
2      Institutional Arrangements and Guidelines&#13;
5.     Introduction. The purpose of the institutional arrangements and guidelines detailed&#13;
below is to ensure as far as possible that resources in the Project are intermediated through&#13;
only those participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) which can be reasonably determined&#13;
to be solvent and well-managed in accordance with sound financial practices and which&#13;
operate in a way in which they will allocate funds productively to the private sector. The&#13;
Apex in consultation with IDA would be responsible for qualifying institutions based on an&#13;
evaluation of the solvency, financial position and intermediation capacity of each&#13;
prospective PFI. To avoid duplication the support of the BOZ's Department of Bank&#13;
Supervision will be used to maximum degree possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-                             Annex F&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
A.   The Apex Institution&#13;
6.    Functional Responsibilities. The Multiple-purpose Credit Facility (MCF) will be&#13;
managed by an apex institution (Apex).  The Apex will have the following&#13;
responsibilities:&#13;
(a) Request and obtain initial funds from the MCF account, opened by the Government of&#13;
Zambia which contains funds forwarded from project's special account, when initial&#13;
disbursements commence, and when additional disbursements are required due to&#13;
disbursements to granting of sub-loans, request and obtain additional disbursements.&#13;
(b) Approve the eligibility of Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) and set limits&#13;
for total exposure to each based on the PFIs' capital. Update periodically the list and&#13;
exposure limits of PFIs&#13;
(c) Receive, process and approve applications from PFIs for sub-loans from the MCF.&#13;
(d) Disburse MCF funds to the PFIs in accordance with the disbursement schedule of the&#13;
approved sub-loans.&#13;
(e) Collect from the PFIs the amounts due from the sub-loans.&#13;
(f) Manage the amounts un-disbursed, from the original IDA disbursements and from&#13;
repayments of sub-loans by PFIs, for safety and maximum return.&#13;
(g) Promote the lines of credits with the PFIs and other financial institutions that are&#13;
eligible to be PFIs, and the private sector in general as potential final borrowers.&#13;
(h) Collect from PFIs, process and provide GRZ and IDA with the periodic reports&#13;
requested by them.&#13;
(i) Manage the sinking fund, in collaboration with BOZ as a trustee to secure the amounts&#13;
for repayment to IDA of principal and interest on the loan as due according to the IDA&#13;
loan agreement.&#13;
7.    Principles of Apex Operations. The following is a brief outline of the basic&#13;
principles of execution of the above mentioned primary functional responsibilities of the&#13;
Apex:&#13;
(a) Request and obtain funds from the MCF special account in accordance with&#13;
its disbursement schedule against the sub-loans approved by PFIs: With the EDP project&#13;
becoming effective, GRZ will open a project account for the MCF component of the&#13;
project and deposit any withdrawal for MCF purposes from the Special Account&#13;
mentioned in para. 5.42 of SAR to this account for the use of Apex. When the amounts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-                              Annex F&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
available in the project account is not sufficient for meeting next month's disbursement&#13;
schedule to the PFIs, the Apex will request replenishment of the project account.&#13;
Subsequent to the Apex's request, the government will either replenish the project&#13;
account by accessing the special account or in the case of lack of funds in the special&#13;
account, apply to IDA for the replenishment of the special account with the required&#13;
documentation under the development credit agreement.&#13;
(b) Approve the eligibility of Participating Financial Intermediaries (PF1s) and&#13;
set limits for total exposure to each, based on the PFIs' capital. Update periodically the&#13;
list and exposure limits of PFIs: GRZ and IDA intend to allow as many banks and other&#13;
financial institutions as possible to become PFIs, as long as they qualify for participation&#13;
based on their financial strength. As a rule, all commercial banks licensed, to operate in&#13;
Zambia will be eligible--excluding those specialized state owned banks such as DBZ,&#13;
Exim--as long as they meet BOZ prudential regulation requirements, namely minimum&#13;
capital requirements, capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratios, and as long as BOZ is&#13;
satisfied with their portfolio standing, their procedures for evaluating loan applications&#13;
and with their allocations to bad-debt provisions and their accounting policies for&#13;
suspension of recording interest as income when loan repayments are in arrears. For each&#13;
approved PFI, a limit of total exposure will be set, based on its net-worth (capital and&#13;
reserves). To allow for competition between the banks, the limits will be set in a way that&#13;
will allow the total exposure limit to be significantly higher than the MCF amount. For&#13;
the initial limit, an amount equal to 100% of total first and second tier capital is&#13;
suggested. The eligibility of the PFIs and additional financial institutions will be&#13;
reviewed and adjusted periodically, at least once a year when the PFIs publish their&#13;
annual audited financial statements. Immediate changes in eligibility for new loans will&#13;
be implemented when BOZ provides indications of changes in the financial standing of&#13;
PFIs. To facilitate prompt adjustments in eligibility and limits, without elaborate data&#13;
collection and analysis by the Apex, it will rely on data collected and analyzed by BOZ&#13;
bank supervision department. As banks filings with BOZ are confidential information,&#13;
all institutions applying for participation in the intermediation of the MCF will be&#13;
required to submit a waiver of confidentiality to BOZ, authorizing BOZ to provide the&#13;
Apex with all information, off-site and on-site inspection data and reports pertaining to&#13;
them without any need for additional permission or consent. This waiver will be&#13;
effective and irrevocable for as long as the PFI remains indebted to the Apex or maintain&#13;
an operational credit line with the Apex. Non-bank financial institutions will also be&#13;
eligible to be qualified as PFIs, as long as they meet identical requirements. For these&#13;
institutions, the Apex will depend on BOZ data and analysis when these are available, or&#13;
collect data and do its own analysis when BOZ data and analysis is not available. Close&#13;
liaison between the Apex and BOZ will secure prompt transfer of information to allow&#13;
immediate action on behalf of the Apex when the financial standing of PFIs change:&#13;
(c) Receive, process and approve applications from PFIs for sub-loans from the&#13;
MCF: PFIs will submit requests for sub-loans to the Apex. Such applications will&#13;
contain the following information:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60-                              Annex F&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
*  Name of borrower, and any group the borrower belongs to (to allow the Apex&#13;
to prevent any borrower or group exceeding the maximum set for each facility&#13;
for single borrower or group)&#13;
*  Short description of the borrowing company, including its main activities and&#13;
products, annual sales and total employment, and of the investment or export&#13;
activity financed (to establish that the loan is for eligible purposes)&#13;
*  Amounts approved and the projected disbursement schedule.&#13;
*  Terms of repayments (duration, interest charged, grace period granted for&#13;
principal and interest, if any) and repayment schedule. The Apex will not&#13;
evaluate or assess the sub-loans for their economic and financial viability, as&#13;
this is the responsibility of the PFIs, which in turn take upon themselves all&#13;
the risks&#13;
(d) Disburse MCF funds to the PFIs in accordance with the disbursement&#13;
schedule of the approved sub-loans:    PFIs will receive the amounts due for&#13;
disbursements an agreed number of days before they are due to the borrowers but no&#13;
longer than one week. With each sub-loan application a preliminary disbursement&#13;
schedule will be submitted, and towards the end of each month each PFI will submit an&#13;
updated list of all disbursements due in the coming month with a report on all actual&#13;
disbursements to borrowers in the current month. Weekly disbursements will then be&#13;
provided to meet the disbursement needs of the PFIs. A penalty interest rate, being a rate&#13;
double that of the MCF regular rate of interest will be charged to the PFIs for amounts&#13;
disbursed to them and not disbursed to final borrowers and not returned within one week&#13;
of the scheduled disbursements;&#13;
(e) Collect from the PFIs the amounts due from the sub-loans. For all sub-loans&#13;
the repayment schedule will be submitted with the sub-loan application and updated&#13;
when disbursements are complete, to allow for delays in actual loan disbursements. Once&#13;
the final repayment schedule is established, all amounts due will be paid by the PFIs to&#13;
the Apex within one week after repayments by final borrower are due, independent of the&#13;
actual repayment by the final borrower. Repayments will be made in US dollars or in&#13;
Kwacha at the exchange rate effective at the day of transfer. When repayment is made in&#13;
Kwacha, the Apex will convert the amount repaid into dollars for sinking fund&#13;
investment and recycling.&#13;
(f) Manage the amounts un-disbursed, from the original IDA disbursements and&#13;
from repayments of sub-loans by PFIs, for safety and maximum return: Amounts with the&#13;
Apex will originate from the IDA disbursements and from repayment of sub-loans. The&#13;
sinking fund arrangement described below will ensure the continuation of the availability&#13;
of the funds for the Apex for an unlimited period, with the amount growing from interest&#13;
income above the Apex administrative costs and the amounts required for allocations to&#13;
the sinking fund. At any time, such amounts at the disposal of the Apex will be managed&#13;
as deposits with first-class international banks, under the best terms and conditions&#13;
obtainable in the international financial market. Funds beyond the amounts required for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-                             Annex F&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
disbursement in the coming month may also be invested in short-term financial&#13;
instruments issued by governments of countries with the highest financial rating.&#13;
(g) Promote the lines of credits with the PFIs and other financial institutions that&#13;
are eligible to be PFIs, and the private sector in general as potential final borrowers:&#13;
The Apex is expected to actively promote the lines of credit with all PFIs, as well as&#13;
promote the applications of additional financial intermediaries that meet the prudential&#13;
requirements. The Apex will keep the PFIs informed on availability of funds for new&#13;
applications. The Apex will also actively advertise the lines of credit to the private sector&#13;
businesses that constitute the potential final borrowers.&#13;
(h) Collect from PFIs, process and provide GRZ and IDA with the periodic&#13;
reports requested by them. The Apex will provide GRZ and IDA with all the reports&#13;
required by them.. Such reports will include Quarterly reports on financial data regarding&#13;
the Apex balance sheet and income statements, outstanding loans for each facility by&#13;
sector of the final borrowers and by PFIs. Ad hoc reports for GRZ and IDA (such as for&#13;
example for the mid-term review and for the Project Completion Report) will be prepared&#13;
upon request. The Apex accounts will be audited by external auditors acceptable to IDA&#13;
and auditors' reports submitted to GRZ and IDA not later than three months after the&#13;
financial year end.&#13;
(i) Manage the sinking fund, in collaboration with BOZ as trustee to secure the&#13;
amounts for repayment to IDA of principal and interest on the loan as due according to&#13;
the IDA loan agreement: GRZ and IDA intend to make the MCF a perpetual fund that&#13;
will continuously provide new loans when the original loans are repaid. As the terms and&#13;
conditions of the IDA loan are more favorable than financial market conditions, it will be&#13;
feasible to generate enough funds to repay IDA both interest and principal by allocating&#13;
part of the interest collected by Apex to a sinking fund invested in interest-bearing AAA&#13;
international debt securities. The sinking fund will be calculated to accumulate enough&#13;
funds to repay, in addition to the MCF amount all other components of the EDP loan&#13;
which will be in the form of grants and will not generate repayments. The annual&#13;
allocation to the sinking fund will depend on the international financial market interest&#13;
rates on AAA debt securities. The amount required will also depend on exchange-rates&#13;
development between the US dollar, in which the MCF will be managed, and the&#13;
currencies basket in which the IDA loan is provided. The management of the fund and&#13;
the determination of the annual allocation will be the responsibility of the Apex, with the&#13;
funds allocated and the securities held in trust for GRZ by BOZ. The details of the&#13;
formula for fixing the annual allocation will be prepared by the Apex and approved by&#13;
IDA. In principle, the formula will provide for the present value of the annual allocations&#13;
to the sinking fund to equal the present value of all future payments to IDA at the market&#13;
interest rates, with reserves for potential future reduction in interest rates and changes in&#13;
the exchange rates between the US dollar and the IDA currency basket. Base on the&#13;
assumption that the market interest rate is around 5 % and there is a need to provide an&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations and interest rates fluctuations reserve of 20 %, the annual&#13;
allocation to the sinking fund is 3.25%. The Apex lending interest rate will be 12 month&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-                              Annex F&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
LIBOR plus 1% (after consultations with IDA, this rate may be fixed in the range of&#13;
between LIBOR and LIBOR plus 2%). Out of the interest earned, the amount for the&#13;
sinking fund will be invested as described above; The amount required to cover the Apex&#13;
administration costs, as described below, will be paid to the Apex management company&#13;
(and at a later stage to DBZ). All interest income above the allocations to the sinking&#13;
fund and the administrative fee to the Apex will belong to GRZ and will be added to the&#13;
MCF fund for new lending.&#13;
8.    Permanent Apex Residence. A financial apex organization will be responsible&#13;
to manage MCF. This apex will be established by the government. Until the&#13;
establishment of such an apex, a temporary arrangement mentioned in paragraph 8 below&#13;
will be responsible for managing the credit lines of MCF. Provided that IDA finds the&#13;
permanent apex organization satisfactory in terms of its capitalization, organizational&#13;
structure and staffing, the responsibility to manage MCF along with the existing portfolio&#13;
of MCF funds will be transferred to the permanent apex from the temporary arrangement.&#13;
9.    Temporary Arrangement. In order to provide an early activation of MCF, an&#13;
interim solution until such time as DBZ is restructured to the satisfaction of IDA is&#13;
proposed. For this purpose the following interim arrangements were requested by GRZ&#13;
and agreed by IDA Management:&#13;
*  The official agency to perform the role of the Apex will be the Ministry Of&#13;
Finance (MOF). By the Ministry being the agency, there will be no need to&#13;
find an institution with adequate capital for the interim solution;&#13;
*  To actively manage and perform the Apex activities on behalf of MOF, a&#13;
private sector company, an investment bank or financial services company,&#13;
will be hired by the Apex Supervisory Committee (see below) in accordance&#13;
with IDA prior review. The initial contract with the management company&#13;
will be for one year with an option to extend the contract for an additional one&#13;
to two years. The contract will specify all the operational parameters of the&#13;
contractor;&#13;
*  The Apex management company will be authorized by MOF to act on its&#13;
behalf on all matters that relate to the operations of the Apex and be&#13;
supervised by a board with representatives from the MOF, MCTI, the bankers&#13;
association and private sector; and&#13;
*  The Apex Management Company will seek the approval of IDA for the initial&#13;
round of eligible banks and their respective limits. Furthermore, the Apex&#13;
management Company will not increase the set limits for these institutions&#13;
without IDA's approval. Any new qualifications will also need the IDA&#13;
approval. Disqualification and decrease in limits due to urgent circumstances&#13;
may be exercised by the Apex with a prompt notice to IDA.&#13;
10.   Costs of Apex Arrangement. The operational and administration costs of the&#13;
Apex will be covered from a spread between the interest charged to the PFIs and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-                             Annex F&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
interest to be placed in the sinking fund. Remainder of the funds will be added to funds&#13;
available for lending. When the MCF total amount will be placed with the PFIs, a 1%&#13;
administration charge will provide US $ 400,000 per year, and will be sufficient to cover&#13;
the Apex operational cost. As the permanent Apex starts executing other credit lines, it&#13;
will have the opportunity to spread its costs to a larger volume of business and will&#13;
decrease the cost-spread that it charges. For the initial phase, until 80% of the MCF&#13;
amounts are placed, the Apex management company will be allowed to charge 2%&#13;
administration charge up to a limit of US $ 400,000. For the first two years of operations&#13;
a special contingency budget of US$400,000 will be provided by the TA component of&#13;
EDP to cover costs during the two-year period to pay for the Contractor if it is needed.&#13;
The need for these funds obviously will be determined by the pace of disbursements and&#13;
on the fee structure of selected contractor.&#13;
11.   Contractor Performance. As part of the contract, the Apex Contractor will be&#13;
committed to develop, and obtain board approval of, an annual work plan for each&#13;
twelve-month period of operation of the contract. This will specify in detail the activities&#13;
to be carried out in order to launch and promote the credit-lines, and to manage it under&#13;
the terms of this SPOP. It will also specify the number of approvals and disbursements&#13;
expected for each quarter, and will specify what is to be done, in each quarter, to assess&#13;
the ongoing impact of the credit-lines. Progress made in achieving this plan, plus&#13;
modifications proposed to the plan, would be reported to the board for each operational&#13;
quarter, to be submitted within 10 days of the end of each operational quarter.&#13;
Modifications would then have to be agreed with the board. The quarterly report will&#13;
elaborate in detail on all planned activities and indicators, giving variances and reasons.&#13;
It would analyse approvals for the period, and cummulatively, by industry, by region, by&#13;
type of activity supported, and by firm size.&#13;
12.   Contractor Financial Standing. The contractor will be expected to present to&#13;
the Supervisory Committee, ahead of each twelve-month operating period, evidence of&#13;
continuing good financial standing as a company, usually in the form of an auditor's&#13;
opinion on annual business accounts. This evidence will also be required ahead of&#13;
contract signing.&#13;
13.   Contract Termination. In the event that the contractor fails to perform to the&#13;
satisfaction of the Supervisory Committee and/or IDA, the contract may be terminated by&#13;
the Supervisory Committee at any time, giving one month's notice, and subject to the&#13;
prior approval for the move by IDA.&#13;
14.   Final Impact Survey. The comprehensive evaluation of scheme impact will be&#13;
carried out by means of a sample survey of recipient firms, one year after the completion&#13;
of disbursement of all the funds allocated for credit lines, but to be completed no later&#13;
than five months after project closing date. This timing would enable the results to be&#13;
incorporated into the Implementation Completion Report for the project. The survey will&#13;
be contracted out by either the Apex Committee, in case of the temporary arrangement, or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-                               Annex F&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
by the Apex to an independent specialist, this choice to be approved in advance by the&#13;
IDA. The survey will include comprehensive site visits to a minimum of 10% of&#13;
recipients, and will seek not only to evaluate direct incremental impact on sales revenue,&#13;
profitability, export levels, employment impact, but also to gather information on indirect&#13;
impact, such as on customer orientation, quality assurance, continuing product&#13;
development, employee motivation, company image. It will also specifically seek to&#13;
evaluate the level of satisfaction firms express with respect to the operation of the credit-&#13;
lines.&#13;
15.   Interim Impact Survey. Although the final impact survey will allow all stake-&#13;
holders to evaluate properly the eventual impact of the credit lines, these stake-holders&#13;
will also require an interim evaluation somewhat earlier. A project-wide mid-term review&#13;
is planned for latest June 30, 1999. At least one month prior to the review, the Apex&#13;
Committee is to furnish a detailed report on the progress to date with the scheme. The&#13;
Committee will therefore conduct a smaller representative interim sample survey, to&#13;
achieve an interim evaluation of impact within this report. This, too, will be carried out&#13;
by an independent specialist, but will be based on only around ten site visits.&#13;
B.    Information Required About Eligible Participating Financial Institutions&#13;
(PFIs)&#13;
16.   Participation in the Multi-Purpose Credit Facility would, in principle, be open to all&#13;
licensed financial institutions in good standing. The evaluation of financial institutions&#13;
(FIs) to participate in the Project would be determined on the basis of information and&#13;
criteria set out below.&#13;
17.   Financial institutions applying for participation in the Facility or wishing to&#13;
maintain eligibility to participate would be required to provide to the Apex and IDA a&#13;
written consent that all information that is or will be available to the Bank of Zambia's&#13;
Department of Bank Supervision would also be made available to the Apex and IDA&#13;
without delay. Such consent would release BOZ from any obligations to maintain&#13;
confidentiality with respect to bank supervision reports, preliminary assessments about a&#13;
Financial Institution's adherence to prudential regulation, or any other information related&#13;
to the financial institution's financial position and its soundness. In addition, financial&#13;
institutions would be required to furnish any other information which the Apex, BOZ or&#13;
IDA may consider necessary for purposes of conducting an assessment.  Financial&#13;
institutions may ask BOZ not release any customer specific information and information on&#13;
the maturity structure of its treasury bill holdings to the temporary Apex Contractor. Any&#13;
other information that the financial instititions do not want to be released to the Contractor&#13;
requires IDA's approval.&#13;
18.   The Bank of Zambia would furnish periodically to the Apex, and in addition upon&#13;
request of the Apex or IDA, supervision reports, both routine and special, for the purpose of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-                              Annex F&#13;
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility&#13;
supporting the Apex's evaluation of the PFIs. BOZ will also inform the Apex as to any&#13;
substantial change in its own opinion as to the changes in the financial position of all PFIs.&#13;
C.    Accounts &amp; Audit Procedures&#13;
19.   Project Account. Apex Committee will open a project account which will&#13;
receive funds from project's special account for the expenditures authorized under MCF.&#13;
The payments for the contractor's fee will also be made out of this account.&#13;
20.   Auditing.  The MCF will require an annual financial audit by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the IDA, with certified copies of audited accounts to be submitted&#13;
within six months of each fiscal year. In addition to their normal financial verification&#13;
work, the auditors will be required to verify that the quarterly operational reports&#13;
provided by the contractor represent a true and fair representation of activities undertaken&#13;
and results so far achieved. MCF will also require an annual operational audit, to assess&#13;
whether objectives are being met, and procedures respected. Appointment of contractors&#13;
for these operational audits, plus the form and Terms of Reference are again to be&#13;
satisfactory to the IDA. The Apex Committee will therefore propose, upon hiring of the&#13;
contractor, these audit details, and submit them to the IDA, for approval.&#13;
21.   Management Accounts and Records. Administration of MCF by the contractor&#13;
will require detailed internal record-keeping for management purposes. However, internal&#13;
record-keeping arrangements will need to be approved as acceptable to both the&#13;
appointed financial and operational audit contractors. To allow the management unit to&#13;
function effectively, these arrangements will be submitted to the audit contractors within&#13;
three months after hiring of the contractor, with agreement on acceptable arrangements to&#13;
be concluded at the latest one month after submission. In the event of delays, or failure to&#13;
agree, the Apex Committee will have the authority to approve record-keeping&#13;
arrangements as being acceptable for audit purposes.&#13;

ZAMBIA&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
1.    The Institutional Development component of the project has two objectives. First,&#13;
it aims at enhancing capabilities of financial institutions. Second, it aims at creating a&#13;
platform from which market information could be delivered to entrepreneurs. The project&#13;
would finance four initiatives to upgrade capabilities of commercial banks and BOZ's&#13;
bank supervision. The project would also finance a technical assistance to Export Board&#13;
of Zambia (EBZ) to establish an information base easily accessible to all Zambian&#13;
entrepreneurs and private firms with links to major information sources. The project&#13;
would also finance a matching grant scheme for individual banks which would be&#13;
administered according to the same principles as MGS.&#13;
1.    Financial Sector Technical Assistance&#13;
A     EDP - BANK TA.&#13;
2.    Objective. The focus of EDP- BANK TA will be improving Zambian banks'&#13;
ability to evaluate medium-to-long term projects and their familiarity with international&#13;
trade transactions. The Zambia Institute of Bankers (ZIB) agreed to host a three-course&#13;
program aimed at providing theory and practical knowledge. Subjects of the coursses will&#13;
be project evaluation, trade related transactions and principles of modem bank&#13;
management.&#13;
3.    Rationale. As a result of macroeconomic and financial market conditions, the&#13;
commercial banks in Zambia have been intermediating mainly short-term local currency&#13;
funds and many of them have had little exposure to long-term lending or the economic&#13;
and financial evaluation of investment projects. Likewise, Zambian banks have had little&#13;
exposure to foreign exchange lending for exports, and only limited exposure to other&#13;
aspects of export related financial services. Whereas several banks, subsidiaries of&#13;
foreign banking groups, have access to the know-how at their parent banks in the form of&#13;
experience and training facilities, local banks with no foreign affiliation will greatly&#13;
benefit from in-depth training.&#13;
4.    Delivery Structure.  The three-course program will be intensive and last&#13;
approximately three-months. Courses will be offered in the form of evening classes with&#13;
some residential fulf-time periods of about two-three weeks for intensive study. The&#13;
overall management will be done by ZIB. Expected attendance will be around 20- 30&#13;
students nominated by banks and non-bank financial intermediaries.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-67-                              Annex G&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
5.    Delivery Instruments. The three courses will be delivered:&#13;
*  Course I: Project Evaluations: This course will deal with theoretical and&#13;
practical aspects of evaluating investment proposals. It will also deal with&#13;
practical aspects of executing and administering long-term loans and&#13;
monitoring the performance of investment projects.&#13;
* Course II: Export Finance: This course will focus on banking transactions&#13;
related to export finance including trade documentation, lending to exporters,&#13;
executing and administering export finance loans, legal aspects of&#13;
international obligations, monitoring performance, and dealing with different&#13;
currencies.&#13;
*  Course III: Management of Long-term and Export Portfolio: This course is&#13;
intended for the managers of commercial banks. Lending policies and&#13;
procedures, risk management, portfolio management and monitoring, bank&#13;
organization and structure, bank internal controls will be among the topics to&#13;
be addressed.&#13;
6.    Preliminary Terms of Reference for Instructors and Qualifications.  In&#13;
addition to conducting courses, the instructors will:&#13;
v  Prepare a curriculum for a one-semester course in their subject area, in&#13;
consultation with the Zambia Bankers Association (ZBA) and Zambia&#13;
Institute of Bankers (ZIB).&#13;
*  Assist ZBA and ZIB in establishing acceptance criteria for the course&#13;
participants, interviewing candidates and assessing their eligibility.&#13;
v  Coordinate the course bibliography and prepare reading material lists for ZIB&#13;
to procure before the course starts.&#13;
*  Initiate and participate in seminars and discussions with local bankers and&#13;
other officials, and with visiting experts.&#13;
*  Support ZBA and ZIB in the preparation and implementation of continuos&#13;
training and education in banking and financial services.&#13;
Instructors are expected to have an advanced degree in finance with proven experience&#13;
with training bankers, as academics and practitioners.  Experience in training in&#13;
developing countries will also be desirable.&#13;
B.    EDP - ZNCB TA&#13;
7.    Objective. EDP - ZNCB TA will assist ZNCB to upgrade its policies, procedures&#13;
and management information systems.&#13;
8.    Rationale.  ZNCB is the largest commercial bank in Zambia, with assets&#13;
exceeding K 200 billion as of the end of 1995. ZNCB is in urgent need of restructuring.&#13;
A new management team was appointed in mid -1995. This team is actively working to&#13;
restructure the bank and requested IDA's assistance to help them. A major improvement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68-                             Annex G&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
is necessary in their internal information systems and in analytical capacity in decision&#13;
making procedures.&#13;
9.    Delivery Mechanism. The proposed technical assistance would be delivered by&#13;
providing two resident advisors for one-year. One advisor will be a specialist on&#13;
commercial bank management. The other will be a specialist in management information&#13;
systems (MIS).&#13;
10.   Qualifications of Advisors. The management specialist is expected to have had&#13;
higher education in finance and experience of at least ten years in commercial banking&#13;
including a high level management position. The MIS specialist is expected to have&#13;
higher education in finance and/or system analysis as well as data processing related&#13;
subjects, with experience of at least ten years in the design and managemenet of&#13;
commercial banks information systems at a senior level. Experience in the management&#13;
of commercial banks in developing countries will also be desirable.&#13;
11.   Preliminary Terms of Reference. The management specialist will:&#13;
* Support the management of ZNCB in defining its mission, goals and&#13;
practices, restructuring and adjusting the bank staff level and composition and&#13;
the branch network to support the bank's mission, and define qualifications&#13;
for key officers.&#13;
* Assist ZNCB in establishing and implemeting appropriate policies and&#13;
procedures, for all banking activities, including credit policy, treatment of&#13;
non-performing borrowers and treasury activities, with emphasis on risk&#13;
management.&#13;
* Participate in ZNCB management team meetings and support the managing&#13;
director and senior management in efficient and prudent management of the&#13;
institution, based on his international experience.&#13;
The MIS specialist will:&#13;
* Evaluate ZNCB operating information systems and identify the areas that&#13;
need change and improvement. Support the management of ZNCB in&#13;
defining the bank requirements for a modern management information system,&#13;
and deciding on new systems and/or improvements to existing systems.&#13;
. Assist ZNCB in establishing and implementing the modernization of the&#13;
information systems for all banking activities, with special emphasis on risk&#13;
management and loan portfolio management.&#13;
* Participate in ZNCB information systems management team and support it in&#13;
the efficient and timely implementation of improved and new information&#13;
systems, based on his international experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-69-                                Annex G&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
C.    EDP-BOZTA&#13;
12.   Objective. The focus of EDP -Bank Supervision TA will be to enhance BOZ's&#13;
capacity to generate information and risk analysis about all financial institutions under its&#13;
supervision, on the basis of which the apex can qualify and monitor the broadest possible&#13;
base of participating financial institutions (PFIs).&#13;
13.   Rationale. As a financial-intermediation loan, the EDP seeks to grant access to&#13;
funding to as many sound financial institutions as possible while ensuring that the risk&#13;
exposure of each PFI remains consistent with its capacity to assume risk on a sustained&#13;
basis. By enhancing BOZ's capability in collecting data and generating financial reports&#13;
that can be effectively used for off-site analysis, the EDP will improve not only the&#13;
apex's results but also the utility of resources available to other users of bank supervision.&#13;
In light of the scarcity of human resources in Zambia to assess and monitor banks' risk&#13;
profile and performance on the basis of reliable financial reports, the deployment of&#13;
technical assistance to enhance BOZ's capacity to perform this function is more efficient&#13;
than technical assistance supporting the establishment of a new and separate unit within&#13;
the apex with a mandate to conduct virtually the same function.&#13;
14.   Scope of Technical Assistance. To support the accuracy and timeliness of BOZ&#13;
generated financial reports, four areas require improvement:&#13;
(a)  establishing rules and guidelines for banks and their auditors regarding treatment of&#13;
assets and liabilities for financial statements, including annual audited statements and&#13;
monthly unaudited reports. Rules and guidelines must be prepared in consultation with&#13;
licensed banks and the major auditing firms and/or professional associations on a host of&#13;
variables which will include, but are not limited to: (i) portfolio classification, (ii)&#13;
provisioning against bad and doubtful assets and allocation to loan-loss reserves; (iii)&#13;
placing in suspense interest earned but not collected on doubtful loans or loans in arrears&#13;
loans, and recording such interest as income only when actually collected; (iv) the&#13;
revaluation of fixed assets under inflationary conditions and the treatment of the&#13;
revaluation reserve; (v) connected lending; (vi) capital adequacy (non-weighted as well&#13;
risk-weighted); (vii) exposure to risk resulting from open foreign exchange positions,&#13;
mismatched interest rates for assets and liabilities; (viii) reporting requirements for off-&#13;
balance-sheet assets and liabilities (including guarantees, lines of credit, forward&#13;
transactions, options and derivatives), (ix) deviations, if any, from International&#13;
Accounting Standards; (x) financial results presented on a consolidated basis; and (xi)&#13;
corrective action in process due to non-compliance with BOZ regulations;&#13;
(b)    enhancing on-site supervision capabilities;&#13;
(c)    establishing a computerized data collection system which will enable all licensed&#13;
banks to file data with BOZ on a monthly basis via computer link or diskette, thus cutting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-                              Annex G&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
to the minimum both data entry errors and the time between filing by the banks and the&#13;
availability of tabulated data; and&#13;
(d)   procuring and tailoring to BOZ requirements a computer program that presents&#13;
bank data according to a pre-determined report format, computes ratios, displays graphs&#13;
and evaluates the results both against standards and against historical results; the purpose&#13;
will be to flag any aberrations from BOZ regulations or any deterioration in the banks&#13;
financial position. The World Bank's bank-evaluation package will be used as the starting&#13;
point for establishing the reporting and analysis system.&#13;
15.   Delivery Mechanism. The proposed technical assistance would be centered&#13;
around enhancing accounting skills, report generation on-site and off-site analysis. It&#13;
would be delivered by providing three advisors, as well as financing for the purchase of&#13;
appropriate software package(s). The first adviser will be a certified public accountant&#13;
with experience and knowledge in off-site bank supervision and/or bank auditing and/or&#13;
bank accounting systems where internationally accepted standards are applied. The&#13;
second adviser will have the same background but with an experience in on-site bank&#13;
inspection and evaluation. Developing country experience is also desirable. These&#13;
advisers are expected to spend two-to-three months in Zambia for about three times over&#13;
an eighteen-month period. The third adviser will be a specialist in bank information&#13;
systems familiar with bank reporting requirements in a developed financial system. This&#13;
adviser is expected to spend at least six-months in Zambia.&#13;
16.   Preliminary Terms of Reference. The bank accounting specialist will:&#13;
-  consult with major accounting firms, the banking community, their professional&#13;
associations and staff of the Department of Bank Supervision, and reach consensus&#13;
with BOZ management about the financial variables to be monitored for the purpose&#13;
of financial reporting, taking due account of the various forms of risk exposure and&#13;
risk management;&#13;
*  provide definitions and accounting treatment of all items in the financial statements of&#13;
licensed banks (assets, liabilities, income, expenses, reserves and capital);&#13;
*  develop accounting directives and guidelines for the recording of bank assets,&#13;
liabilities, capital, reserves, income and expenditures in the banks' accounts, and for&#13;
banks' periodic and annual reports issued to the public and/or submitted to BOZ;&#13;
issues to be covered will include, but are not limited to, those listed in para.14(a)&#13;
above;&#13;
*  provide standards for disclosure to public and to all the regulatory agencies, including&#13;
BOZ;&#13;
*  assume a lead facilitator role for continuous dialogue among licensed financial&#13;
institutions, major accounting firms and staff of the Department of Bank Supervision&#13;
and hold periodic meetings with these institutions to establish a mutual understanding&#13;
of issues related to the scope of the technical assistance program;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-                             Annex G&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
* cooperate with BOZ officials and their advisers in the preparation of new regulations&#13;
and circulars and in the modification of existing regulations, if and when so requested&#13;
by BOZ senior management;&#13;
* cooperate with the ongoing donor-supported programs for the improvement of bank-&#13;
supervision issues;&#13;
* coach staff of the Department of Bank Supervision in implementing accounting&#13;
guidelines and directives, with a view to enabling them to apply Internationally&#13;
Accepted Standards to their work;&#13;
* prepare progress reports to IDA and to BOZ management on the technical assistance&#13;
program, including assessments of the quality of accounting entries that are inputted&#13;
by BOZ into computer systems and transformed into financial reports;&#13;
* organize and teach courses in bank accounting related courses; and&#13;
* support BOZ management in evaluating the quality of bank reports on the basis of&#13;
analysis and evaluation.&#13;
The on-site inspection specialist will:&#13;
* review BOZ procedures and formats for on-site inspection;&#13;
* update these procedures in line with current international practice;&#13;
* conduct courses for BOZ supervision department staff involved in on-site inspections&#13;
* participate in BOZ on-site inspection to provide on-the-job-training; and&#13;
* use experience from such inspection as cases which will be analyzed with BOZ staff&#13;
to improve performance.&#13;
The specialist in management information systems will:&#13;
*  develop a system that will monitor and evaluate commercial banks by working in&#13;
colloboration with Zambian banking sector, professional associations and staff of&#13;
Bank Supervison Department of BOZ.&#13;
*  make use of existing bank monitor and evaluation systems to the extent possible&#13;
including adapting the World Bank's diskette "Analysis of Bank System" to&#13;
Zambian needs, incorporating the comments of the banking sector, auditors and staff&#13;
of the Department of Bank Supervision with the objectives of (a) tailoring and&#13;
improving the quality and relevance of output and reflecting emerging regional&#13;
standards and (b) facilitating the writing of reports that can be used as inputs into a&#13;
system of on-site examination;&#13;
*  add any tables necessary to monitor compliance with regulations that are not directly&#13;
related to risk management, for example the calculation of cash reserve requirements,&#13;
liquid asset requirements, investment limits, etc.to the system that will be adapted;&#13;
*  in the case of adapting the World Bank's diskette: (i) simplify the model by&#13;
delinking currently linked workbooks, while maintaining the ability to produce&#13;
graphs; (ii) produce an error report, clearly identifying items that should but do not&#13;
agree arithmetically; and (iii) write a macro-routine to enable the consolidation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-                              Annex G&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
reports for the banking system, while maintaining the capability of producing graphs,&#13;
both for the banking system as a whole and for individual banks;&#13;
*  if necessary, identify and arrange for the purchase of a software package that can best&#13;
generate financial reports and supporting graphs and summary statistics, along the&#13;
lines outlined above in conformity with internationally accepted standards, cost&#13;
efficiency and emerging regional trends;&#13;
*  work with staff of the Department of Bank Supervision, in consultation with the&#13;
World Bank, to ensure that the resulting reporting system is based on formats that are&#13;
consistent, to the extent feasible, with systems available in the African sub-region in&#13;
order to facilitate the consolidation of cross-border data; and&#13;
*  assist staff within BOZ and commercial banks, through training and technical&#13;
support, in the implementation of the bank information systems.&#13;
D.    EDP - APEX TA&#13;
16.   Objective. EDP- APEX TA is intended to be a contingency fund for the Apex&#13;
operation. Although the cost of Apex operation will be covered through the interest&#13;
charges on credit lines, the initial disbursement levels might not be enough to cover the&#13;
cost of the private contractor or its fee structure. In this case, EDP - APEX TA funds will&#13;
be used to make up the difference. In addition to these, any remaining funds could be&#13;
used to help the permanent Apex during its start-up phase.&#13;
2.    Technical Assistance to Export Board of Zambia&#13;
17.   Information Brokering. Information brokers intermediate between businesses&#13;
requiring information and electronically stored databases of such information around the&#13;
world. Information brokers add value by knowing where to locate difficult-to-find&#13;
information, and by having the specialized skills of accessing distant databases.&#13;
18.   Objective. EDP- EBZ TA will assist EBZ to establish an information brokering&#13;
service in Zambia to provide a vast spectrum of market related data from around the&#13;
world to Zambian firms and entrepreneurs. This service will access to on-line data&#13;
including collections of patents and trade-marks; published market research reports;&#13;
stockbroker reports; trade statistics from many countries; news clipping services covering&#13;
tens of thousands of newspapers, journals and newsletters around the world; and trade&#13;
directories for many countries, listing companies by specialization or location; listing of&#13;
importers.&#13;
19.   Rationale. The current advances in information technology have made it possible&#13;
to access vast networks of data from around the world. The bulk of such data was located&#13;
traditionally in the specialized libraries scattered around the world.  Businesses in&#13;
developing countries had very little opportunity of finding or utilizing such information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-73-                               Annex G&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
The project is intended to stimulate efforts of Zambian firms to enhance their&#13;
competitiveness. Such efforts will require access to global market intelligence.&#13;
20.   Delivery Mechanism.  EDP - EBZ TA will support a short program  of&#13;
specialized training for an EBZ staff member, designed to equip him/her to operate&#13;
quickly an effective business information brokering service on completion of this&#13;
training. This staff member in turn is expected to conduct similar training within the&#13;
Export Board of Zambia so that the knowledge and skills gained by this staff can be&#13;
passed onto others within the institution. Training will take place overseas where such&#13;
training is pertinent.&#13;
21.   Delivery Structure. The delivery of the training program will be contracted out&#13;
to an information brokering firm. The contractor would then lay on a structured program&#13;
of work for the trainee, lasting two to three months. This would probably be split&#13;
between periods spent with two firms, to give exposure to different operating styles. As&#13;
well as providing internal on-the-job training, the contractor would arrange for the trainee&#13;
to attend a number of external training courses, such as those run by on-line service hosts.&#13;
Upon the conclusion of the training, the staff member will develop a plan for in-house&#13;
training of the other relevant EBZ staff. EBZ will submit a copy of the proposed plan to&#13;
IDA for comments. The in-house training should take place no later than three-months&#13;
after the return of overseas trained EBZ staff back to Zambia.&#13;

I.    Critical Issues. The most critical issue related to the project implementation has&#13;
already been achieved by appointing the Apex and Matching Grant Supervisory&#13;
Committees.  These boards have already started the process of hiring the private&#13;
executors for MCF and MGS. Choosing of a qualified executors in a timely manner is&#13;
the single most important element for the successful implementation of the project. It is&#13;
the intention of these boards to go ahead with the tendering process prior to the project's&#13;
approval so that the key executors of the project could be in place once the project is&#13;
approved and became effective. Ongoing tendering process is being done using IDA&#13;
Guidelines. The Commitees which carry out the tendering process are in constant touch&#13;
with the Task Team and the procurement specialist in the resident mission in Zambia.&#13;
2.    Critical Dates.  Since the project executors will be appointed prior to the&#13;
approval of the project by the Board, the critical item remains to be launching the project.&#13;
The following tables outlines timing of the key activities assuming the selection of&#13;
private executors for MCF and MGS appointed prior to the effectiveness. The auditors&#13;
for the project accounts will be appointed within a two month-period after effectiveness.&#13;

Economic Analysis and Performance Monitoring Indicators&#13;
1.    Although it is very difficult to quantify benefits from this project, ultimately&#13;
financing of US$40 million in investments in the industrial sector provides a signal of the&#13;
order of magnitude of benefits to the economy, as does the financing of US$15 million in&#13;
exports per year. MGS would provide know-how of about US$7 million to be injected&#13;
into Zambian firms. The difficulty in measuring benefits lies in the fact that the project&#13;
would be supporting the acceleration of a process leading to an outcome rather than&#13;
supporting concrete outcome directly. In addition, it is impossible to identify in advance&#13;
the investments or exports to be financed out of the MCF. Nevertheless, the project&#13;
would generate an estimated Net Present Value (NPV) of US$12.60 million discounted at&#13;
13%, and an economic rate of return of approximately 17%. Table Kl presents a&#13;
summary of NPV estimates for the project.&#13;

2.    Methodology. A series of assumptions has been made to compute the NPVs.&#13;
These assumptions are as follows:&#13;
* For ICF, a separate loan approval and a withdrawal process were assumed under three&#13;
different scenarios (base, medium, and fast) on a quarterly basis. It was further&#13;
assumed that the investments to be financed under this facility would be typically 10-&#13;
year projects, and would require 5-year loans with a one-year grace period and an&#13;
interest rate of about LIBOR plus 3 percentage points (approximated to 9%).&#13;
Investor's equity contribution assumed to be 25% of the total project, would also take&#13;
place during the first year. The project was assumed to have no negative cash-flows&#13;
at any time. During the first year, expenditures would be financed either from a&#13;
withdrawal from the credit line or from equity or both. An accelerated net output-&#13;
flow was assumed to yield a value equivalent of initial investment in 10 years. This&#13;
corresponds to an annual compounded growth rate of approximately 7%. Output&#13;
increase due to equity participation in the project was omitted to compensate for any&#13;
diversion from other activities on the part of investors. The Economic Rate of Return&#13;
(ERR) was assumed to be 13 %.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-82-                            Annex L&#13;
Economic Analysis and Performance Monitoring Indicators&#13;
*  For EPF, a similar methodology was applied. In this case a typical loan was assumed&#13;
to have a six month maturity with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3% (again&#13;
approximately at 9%). It was also assumed that the banks are willing to finance up to&#13;
70% of export orders. Since there are substantial reflows vis a vis the size of new&#13;
disbursements through the repayments before the entire facility is disbursed, re-&#13;
lending of these loans was also taken into account until the entire facility is fully&#13;
disbursed. The facility was treated as an investment into the working capital of the&#13;
firms that would also generate a corresponding increase in the level of output. The&#13;
impact of the firm's contribution was omitted to account for diversion of the&#13;
resources from other activities.&#13;
*  For MGS (including MGS-BANK), a methodology was adapted from Levy, Berry&#13;
and Nugent which, based on the empirical evidence in similar schemes, assumes an&#13;
output increase of about 15 times of the matching grant for East Asian countries. For&#13;
this project the multiple was assumed to be 10. Since matching grants would&#13;
basically inject new technical know-how in companies to stay competitive, the ERR&#13;
on the increase in output due to MGS was assumed to be 42%.&#13;
*  Measurement of the economic benefits of institutional development support is the&#13;
most subject to estimation error. For the sake of consistency, it was assumed that the&#13;
support provided would increase the efficiency of the support recipients and would&#13;
yield an increase in the economic outputs at a multiple of two times the amount of&#13;
support. It was also assumed that the benefits would be realized with a lag of one&#13;
year. The ERR was assumed to be 16%.&#13;
3.    Sensitivity Analysis. Three scenarios based on different disbursement profiles&#13;
were considered (except for the institutional development where a uniform disbursement&#13;
was applied for all three scenarios), the results, which were discounted at various rates,&#13;
provide an indication of sensitivity. The following tables supplement Table Kl, which&#13;
summarizes the medium case with a discount rate of 13%.&#13;

The above analysis highlights the benefits of fast implementation of the project.&#13;
Applications including other discount rates and background calculations are available in&#13;
the project files. Some of these calculations are also presented at the end of this annex.&#13;
4.    Other Benefits. There are additional benefits from the project. Among them are:&#13;
-  Improved awareness of economic opportunities which do not directly result in&#13;
increases in output and employment by the firms supported.&#13;
* Secondary and tertiary effects of increases in output.&#13;
* Development of know-how put to use beyond the enterprises supported.&#13;
.  Inducing smaller banks to become better capitalized so that they can qualify for&#13;
participation in the credit lines.&#13;
Improved bank supervision which would reduce the cost of bank failures.&#13;
5.    Main Beneficiaries. The main beneficiaries of the project would be Zambian&#13;
firms and the Zambian financial sector. It is estimated that about 100 firms would&#13;
participate in MGS and about 60 firms would borrow from ICF. EPF is expected to&#13;
finance about 100 export transactions per year.&#13;

Economic Analysis and Performance Monitoring Indicators&#13;
6.    Project Performance Indicators. The most critical aspects of the project are: (i)&#13;
establishment of the Matching Matching Grant Supervisory Committee (MGSC) and the&#13;
Apex Supervisory Committee; and ii) hiring of the the management contractor for the&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme (MGS), and the Apex Management Company. The former has&#13;
already been accomplished. The latter will be resolved prior to the effectiveness of the&#13;
the Development Credit Agreement to this Credit. Therefore, the most significant&#13;
performance indicators during the implementation phase of the project would be: (i) the&#13;
actual disbursement from the project and its impact: and (ii) the quality of technical&#13;
assistance provided and its impact.&#13;
In order to measure the impact of the performance of the Project on the Zambian&#13;
economy, a close monitoring of the subprojects in the aggregate would be needed.&#13;
Increased levels of investments and exports would serve as good indicators of project&#13;
performance. In order to measure the impact the data collected during supervision&#13;
missions will be used to estimate:&#13;
-  revenue generated by MGS in terms of a multiple of the grant element;&#13;
3  rate of return on the investment projects that were financed by the&#13;
Investment Credit Facility (ICF);&#13;
-  export revenue generated through Export Preshipment Facility (ECF);&#13;
and&#13;
*  employment impact on project components;&#13;
The impact of the Apex on financial intermediaries would be measured by the level of&#13;
participation among the commercial banks. This participation will be measured by:&#13;
&#149;  number of intermediaries participating in the scheme;&#13;
*  average loan size, maturity, sector and customer profile for each&#13;
participating financial intermediary (PFI), (i.e. to see if PFIs start&#13;
specializing in certain market segments);&#13;
*  independent development of similar lending instruments by PFIs;&#13;
*  development of similar schemes by other concessionary resources; and&#13;
*  collection performance of the Apex&#13;
The impact of technical assistance will be assessed through qualitative observations of the&#13;
relevant operations of recipient organizations.&#13;

ZAMBIA&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Financial Sector Overviewl&#13;
7.     Zambia's financial sector is small in relation to the size of its economy and to its&#13;
population, and it has been steadily shrinking in recent years. Demonetization is evident in the&#13;
ratio of M2 to GDP, which decreased from .22 in 1991 to .11 in May 1995. Similarly, the ratio&#13;
of total bank assets to GDP declined to .20 in May 1995 from .44 in 1991, or 58 percent in real&#13;
terms. While the banking sector's role in the economy is thus becoming marginalized, Treasury&#13;
Bill activity has aggravated bank lending to private enterprises, with substantial evidence of&#13;
crowding out. Treasury Bills held by commercial banks rose from 19 percent of deposits in 1990&#13;
to 42 percent in 1992 and 26 percent in May 1996. Overall, credit to private and parastatal&#13;
enterprises decreased by about 60 percent in real terms during the period 1990 - May 1995,&#13;
including a decline of about 73 percent in the manufacturing sector.&#13;
8.     Nevertheless, most commercial banks in Zambia appear to be functioning profitably and&#13;
to be providing a variety of products and services. The substantial demand for long-term credit&#13;
could in principle be met by a number of banks with sufficient human and capital resources to&#13;
evaluate, appraise and administer long term investment projects. Current indications by bank&#13;
managers point to a capacity to disburse about US$ 50- 60 million in the aggregate over the next&#13;
three years and at their owIn risk, should long-term funds be made available to tlhem.&#13;
9.    In tlis Annex the composition and activities of financial institutions are surveyed. The&#13;
declining role of financial activity is reviewed in Section 1, followed by an overview of recent&#13;
developments in capital markets in Section 11, non-bank financial institutions in Section III and&#13;
specialized financial intermediaries in Section IV. As the financial sector is dominated by&#13;
commercial banks, particular emphasis is placed on their activities and performance - an&#13;
overview of their aggregate structure and performance is presented in Section V, while a review&#13;
of individual banks is presented in Section VI. Issues related to the provision of long-term&#13;
finance are reviewed in Section VII.&#13;
I.     Size and Structure of thie Financial Sector&#13;
10.    The banking sector's total assets at Year-end 1995 aggregated K 801.5 billion (US$0.7&#13;
billion), or 20% of GDP. This is less than half the level in 1991.&#13;
This section is based on the sector work carried out by A. Soylemezoglu and Dan Mozes in June 1995.&#13;
Figures in this work is updated where available.&#13;

Zambia's commercial banking sector's difficulties come from two sources. The first one is the&#13;
declining economy and the second is the very sho.1-term nature of the term-structure of its&#13;
sources of funds. The decline in business volume is critical for newly established and fragile&#13;
banks as they have just entered into a declining industry without sufficient resources.&#13;
11.   The financial sector suffered from violent swings in interest rates both in real and in&#13;
nominal terms while the horizon for investors shrunk to the 28-day Treasury Bill cycle. During&#13;
the last four years inflation rates fluctuated between almost 200% in 1991 to 28 percent in mid-&#13;
1994. Inflation returned to 60 percent at end-1994, declined again to 38 percent by mid-1995,&#13;
and stood at around 45 % at end-1995. Volatility in the real interest rate resulted from the lags in&#13;
inflationary expectations as well as from fluctuations in GRZ demand for funds. The table below&#13;
shows that real interest rates (expressed as the compounded annual effective rates) fluctuated&#13;
between 66 percent positive and 47 percent negative within the last five years.&#13;

2.     Capital Markets&#13;
12.   Capital markets are at an early stage of development. There are no corporate debt&#13;
instruments. Government Treasury Bills with maturities ranging between 28 days and 18 months&#13;
are auctioned by the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) weekly, and are eligible for meeting the liquidity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

requirements of commercial banks. All interest rates of the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) are adjusted&#13;
weekly to the yields on Treasury Bills, and most financial transactions have terms no longer than&#13;
28 days. The magnitude of outstanding Treasury Bills reached 63% of M2 by the end of 1992,&#13;
and went down to a more manageable 38% in mid-1995, rising again to more than 50 % of M2&#13;
by late 1995.&#13;

3.    Non-Bank Institutions&#13;
13.   Commensurate with the level of capital-market development, non-bank financial&#13;
institutions play only a small role in the Zambian economy. The Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE)&#13;
has opened for business, but companies are yet to be listed on the exchange. The first officially&#13;
listed company on the LuSE resulted from a public offering of Chilanga Cement shares by the&#13;
Zambia Privatization Trust Fund in April 1995. All offered shares (27.4% of the company&#13;
shares) were sold for K 3.5 billion to approximately 4,000 buyers.&#13;
14.    Leasing activity is also limited, and most of it is conducted by commercial banks and&#13;
their leasing subsidiaries.&#13;
15.    The Building Society's depositsstood at K 10 billion at March 31, 1995. Most resources&#13;
have been reinvested in large negotiated time deposits with commercial banks -more than K 5&#13;
billion at March 31, 1995. The provision of mortgage loans became non-viable, and some&#13;
interest had to be capitalized on existing mortgage loans because of the persistence of high&#13;

4.    Specialized Intermediaries&#13;
16.    State-owned specialized financial intermediaries are dominated by Lima Bank, Exim&#13;
Bank and the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ). All realized significant losses historically&#13;
and are now being considered for liquidation or restructuring.&#13;
17.   Lima Bank's financial results are typical of the Zambian system of agricultural credit.&#13;
Agricultural seasonal credit was traditionally intermediated with GRZ funds by Lima Bank,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Financial Sector Overview&#13;
CUSA and ZCF-FS. When additional funds from GRZ ceased to be forthcoming, they stopped&#13;
to function because of the very small collection rate oii existing loans. GRZ is now channeling its&#13;
revolving funds for agricultural inputs and  for agricultural produce marketing through&#13;
commercial banks, which lend to merchants, stockists and outgrowers. They in turn provide&#13;
small farmers with seasonal inputs or pay for produce with the funds borrowed from the&#13;
commercial banks. Lima Bank is slated for privatization or liquidation, pending the results of&#13;
ongoing studies.&#13;
18.    DBZ, the traditional source of long-term funds, has proved to be financially non-viable.&#13;
Its loan portfolio has been non-performing and few  loans are properly serviced.  Its&#13;
administrative costs exceeded total disbursements of new loans in 1995. DBZ currently has no&#13;
significant source of funds, which are limited to two small credit lines from the Bank and AfDB.&#13;
With its present portfolio, DBZ is unlikely to qualify for any new credit line from multilateral&#13;
financial institutions. In the framework of the 1995/6 Bank adjustment loan GRZ committed&#13;
itself to restructuring DBZ as an apex organization, which would on-lend concessional funds&#13;
exclusively to financial institutions.&#13;
19.    The Exim Bank historically failed to reach its intended clientele or to intermediate a&#13;
significant volume of funds. A privatization effort is underway; failing which procedures for&#13;
liquidation are planned for application.&#13;
5.     Overview of the Commercial Banking Sector&#13;
20.    Zambia's financial sector is dominated by commercial banking. Nevertheless, since&#13;
1990 total bank deposits have decreased by 48 percent in real terms despite the establishment de&#13;
novo of 15 banks. Most of these new banks are small and have a capital base below US$3&#13;
million. The increase in the number of banks was a market response to liberalized economic&#13;
policies and licensing policy. With the enactment of the Banking and Financial Services Bill in&#13;
December 1994 and the introduction of new BOZ regulations, control over bank entry has&#13;
improved. MOF's authority to grant licenses was transferred to BOZ. Against the background&#13;
of the failure of Meridien Bank in 1995, these newly established small banks are finding it&#13;
extremely difficult to stay in the business with their limited capital base. When BOZ's new&#13;
capital requirement becomes effective in at year-end 1996 the number of banks operating in&#13;
Zambia is likely to decrease from 17 to around 12.&#13;
21.    Foreign owned and locally owned banks exhibit different attitudes which is reflected in&#13;
the structure of their balance sheets. In general, foreign owned banks are more conservative in&#13;
lending and the ratio of their loans to deposits is lower than for local banks. Whereas foreign&#13;
owned banks are more liquid and have a larger capital base, locally owned banks have less&#13;
liquidity and less capital base.&#13;
22.    Market Concentration. Two commercial banks have market shares each exceeding 20&#13;
percent of total bank assets. The largest six banks control over 80 percent of total bank assets.&#13;
Of the bigger banks, Barclays is foreign owned (from the United Kingdom) while Zambia&#13;
National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) is a parastatal. The next four largest banks have market&#13;
shares ranging between 6 and 10 percent of total bank assets. Two are foreign owned - Standard&#13;
Chartered (from the United Kingdom) and Stanbic (from South Africa); the other two are locally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100-                                Annex M&#13;
Financial Sector Overview&#13;
owned - Finance and Union Banks. The remaining eleven banks are quite small in size, several&#13;
accounting for less than one percent of total bank assets. Some of these banks are also foreign&#13;
owned.&#13;

23.    The banking market was shaken by the collapse in 1995 of the then fourth largest bank,&#13;
Meridien BIAO Bank, which had a 17 percent market share. Meridien's failure was precipitated&#13;
mainly by the collapse of its foreign-registered holding company, to which the Zambian bank&#13;
had channeled substantial resources.  Notwithstanding information available to the bank&#13;
supervisory authorities prior to the crisis, they demonstrated a lack of capacity to act on it&#13;
decisively and promptly. Meridien BIAO is now under liquidation. Its collapse and the losses to&#13;
depositors caused further concentration in the banking market as depositors moved to larger,&#13;
foreign-owned banks for safety.&#13;
24.   Bank failures have played an important role in determining market structure and in&#13;
explaining the dominance of four banks (ZNCB, Barclays, Standard Chartered and Grindlays-&#13;
now Stanbic). While the failures of Meridien BIAO and previously BCCI led to greater market&#13;
concentration, the emergence of new, smaller banks has more recently led to market pressure on&#13;
the bigger banks to behave more competitively. Some smaller banks are establishing a wider&#13;
area of coverage through additional branches. The biggest threat to the smaller banks is likely to&#13;
arise from their own size and limited capital base. The public appears unwilling to go through&#13;
another bank failure, as Meridien's failure considerably shook public confidence in both small&#13;
and domestic banks.&#13;
25.   A number of new, smaller banks are in a way the legacy of the failed BCCI. The ex-&#13;
patriate managers of the BCCI, facing uncertain prospects elsewhere, teamed up with local&#13;
investors to establish these banks, which include Finance Bank, Union, Commerce, Credit Africa&#13;
and Africa Commerce Banks. Commerce and Credit Africa have failed and are in liquidation.&#13;
Managers have invested in and/or been given shares by the principal investors in the banks that&#13;
they manage.&#13;
26.   BOZ has recently issued guidelines which require commercial banks to have at least two&#13;
billion Kwachas in capital by year-end 1996. There are eight banks which currently comply with&#13;
this requirement (ZNCB, Barclays, Standard Chartered, Stanbic, Finance, Indo-Zambia, Citi, and&#13;
Union). As of January 1997, BOZ has not acted on enforcing this regulation and those banks&#13;
with capital less than the required level are being allowed to operate.&#13;
27.   The banking community estimates that the total number of banks in the near future will&#13;
be smaller than today, and may reach a number closer to 12 banks. Given the size of the&#13;
economy, the extensive branch network of both the large and the medium size banks, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-                                Annex M&#13;
Financial Sector Overview&#13;
limitations on availability of trained bankers and on supervision capacity, such a development&#13;
would be a positive step in the direction of a stronger banking sector. There appears to be no&#13;
other impetus to bank consolidation, other than a well functioning apex with short and long term&#13;
facilities. An apex institution could prescribe minimum size and capital as a condition for&#13;
intermediating its funds.&#13;
28.    Aggregate Balance Sheet. The consolidated balance sheet of the commercial banking&#13;
sector as of Dec 31, 1995 was structured as follows:&#13;

31.    The composition of deposits remained fairly stable over the same five-year period with&#13;
some sizable fluctuations - up to 10% of total deposits - during the interim. Savings accounts are&#13;
payable on demand and their maturity ranges from one to six months. The market share of&#13;
savings deposits increased until 1994 in response to the enhanced competition generated by a&#13;
growing number of banks offering higher rates of interest.&#13;

32.    An examination of deposits with individual banks shows that some of the smaller banks&#13;
have more deposits than their proportionate share of total assets of the banking sector. This&#13;
discrepancy may be due to ZNCB's debt to the BOZ, as well as the importance of other liabilities&#13;
in the balance sheets of ZNCB, Barclay's and other larger banks.&#13;

33.    Lending.  Zambia's commercial banks have been heavily investing in government&#13;
securities.  This has occurred at the expense of lending to the private sector. Total bank&#13;
investments in Treasury bills rose from 19 percent of total deposits in 1990 to 42 percent in 1992&#13;
and 1993. At year-end 1995 the share of Treasury bills had declined somewhat, but investment&#13;
in Treasury bills, at K147 billion, nevertheless corresponded to 70 percent of the outstanding&#13;
balance of loans to private and parastatal enterprises (K 211 billion), and total investment in&#13;
GRZ debt (loans, Treasury bills and bonds) at K183 billion, represented 87 percent of business&#13;
sector debt.&#13;

34.    A significant portion of private deposits go to finance government activities while the&#13;
private sector faces a significant credit squeeze. Bank loans to the private sector and parastatals&#13;
constitute about 26 percent of total bank assets. This amount corresponds to 56 percent of&#13;
deposits made by these entities. In contrast, the banking sector's investment and lending to&#13;
government is about 23 percent of total assets while deposits by the government are only nine&#13;
percent.&#13;

35.   In real terms credit to private and parastatal enterprises declined by about 50 percent&#13;
during the period 1990 - May 1995. This decrease is even more dramatic in light of the&#13;
incidence of rescheduled loans in the agriculture portfolio rather than new credit activity.&#13;
Moreover, credit to mining and manufacturing lost in absolute terms and its share in total lending&#13;
also declined considerably. Specifically, credit to the mining sector is about 11 percent of 1990&#13;
levels in 1995. Credit to the manufacturing sector decreased by 73 percent during the period&#13;
1990 - 1995.&#13;

36.    Zambian banks started holding significant deposit abroad with the liberalization foreign&#13;
exchange.&#13;

The very high volume of deposits abroad in 1992 and 1993 suggests that the Bank of Zambia on&#13;
the one hand may not have implemented prudent currency risk criteria and the banks on the other&#13;
hand may not have had serious concerns about a possible appreciation of the Kwacha. At 24&#13;
percent of total deposits, deposits abroad at year-end 1995 remains significant and it is about five&#13;
times the level of total foreign currency lending. Foreign exchange lending is less than 30&#13;
percent of foreign exchange deposits.&#13;
37.    The portion of deposits loaned out varies significantly from one bank to another. It&#13;
appears that the foreign-ownied banks are lending less than local banks relative to their deposits.&#13;
This situation further limits the available credit as about fifty percent of total deposits are with&#13;
these banks.&#13;

Foreign-owned banks appear to practice an exceptionally conservative lending policy. Only&#13;
Barclays' loans-to-deposit ratio is above the banking system's average of 52 percent.&#13;
38.    Terms and Collateralization of Loans.  Bank loans are confined to short-term&#13;
maturities and represent working capital and trade finance. This portfolio tends to be backed&#13;
fully with collateral. The only open-account customers are multinationals. A significant part of&#13;
ZNCB's parastatal portfolio is backed by explicit government guarantees. Collateral generally&#13;
involves real estate and is often valued well above the value of the principal and interest. In the&#13;
case of trade finance requiring the issuance of letters of credit, the banks often block equivalent&#13;
amounts of cash or liquid assets (almost always Treasury Bills) throughout the duration of the&#13;
letter of credit.&#13;
39.    Liquidity and Capital Adequacy. Zambian banks have generally satisfactory levels of&#13;
liquidity, as measured by the ratio of liquid assets (cash, deposits with other banks and treasury&#13;
securities) to total liabilities. Most have liquidity levels above the BOZ-prescribed level as a&#13;
result of heavy investment in Treasury bills. Foreign owned banks have a higher liquidity ratio&#13;
than local banks. The system average stands at 47 percent.&#13;

40.    The capital structure of banks likewise reveals a significantly higher level of net worth&#13;
relative to total liabilities among foreign-owned bank subsidiaries than among locally owned&#13;
banks. Aggregate net worth is ten percent of the total liabilities of the sector.&#13;

Although there are smaller banks with a ratio of net worth to total deposits substantially higher&#13;
than the largest banks, their size would render a comparison insignificant.&#13;
41.    Products and Services. Commercial banks in Zambia offer an assortment of products.&#13;
These include traditional deposit instruments (i.e. checking, savings, and time deposits),&#13;
commercial lending mainly in the form of short-term working capital finance, various types of&#13;
letters of credit and money transfer facilities.&#13;
42.    The five largest banks (ZNCB, Barclays, Standard Chartered, Stanbic and Finance) have&#13;
a network of branches. The smaller banks generally have one branch in Lusaka and another in&#13;
the Copperbelt (generally in Ndola). The foreign banks have started to operate specialized&#13;
branches for commercial customers in the Copperbelt.&#13;
43.    Due mainly to shortcomings in existing communication facilities, banks are confined in&#13;
their efforts to further modernize operations by employing electronic media in their network of&#13;
operations. There is an extensive usage of micro-size business computers at the headquarters of&#13;
almost every bank and significant utilization of stand-alone personal computers. The servicing&#13;
of individual accounts is still done through paper-based traditional account files.&#13;

            in Zambia.  Specifically, the project will support
            firm-level efforts at restructuring by: a)enhancing Zambian
            firms' technical know-how; b) enhancing Zambian
            firm's access to finance; and c) strengthening the
            financial system and availability of information resources.
            The project will have the following components: a) matching
            grant scheme, used to stimulate the use of support services
            to assist firms in their reorientation; b) multi-purpose
            credit facility, provided through the commercial banks to
            finance investments as well as stimulate exports; and c)
            institutional development, supported through technical
            assistance for financial institutions and the Export Board
            of Zambia.
