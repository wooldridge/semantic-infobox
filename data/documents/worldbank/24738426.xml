ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is en ered into on January 9, 2015 between:&#13;
(1)   THE BANK OF TOKYO MITh4UBISHI UFJ, LTD, herein represented by its Deputy Presiden 1 a&#13;
headquartered at 2-7-1, Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan ("BTMU"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUF, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND D EVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPME ir&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, Ih,&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvanie&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC: (4: 3,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Grou 3")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Interm ti:- al&#13;
Organizations (lOs), the G77 and the private sector represented by the B20 that investing in  e&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging IVarkets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to e :l 2 d&#13;
access to basic services anc raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic c ri,i,, h&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on e: :i!:t ig&#13;
sources of infrastructure fina ice-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coord nal, d&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize p ivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robl.st pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects and I i: is&#13;
understood to be the greates: barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investmer t&#13;
(D) Governments, development finance institutions, donors, and private investors share an inte ES !n&#13;
developing the market for pr vate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand s d:i n&#13;
the numbers of structurally sound and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual emer :ler e&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range of I r in te&#13;
investors that actively partic pate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will l n: fit&#13;
from collective action betwe an this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowle( cle to&#13;
find solutions to complex i ifrastructure financing challenges that no single institution co. Id&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, thE Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure F 3:: I ty&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF") The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leveragil i . le&#13;
efforts of the wide range of i istitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastructui :v th&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prepa Eli: 1,&#13;
structuring, and risk mitigati )n for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, t C EF&#13;
aims to complement existinq and proposed services and initiatives currently supported !i : ie&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepar iw II-&#13;
structured, infrastructure prcjects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for accessii i( : ie&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from prosra::1ie&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater le) i= rer je&#13;
of official resources in the fe ce of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular fo a le&#13;
and complex projects with th a potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interested in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure I Ec ty&#13;
Partnership Program, togeth)r with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have come to the following understanding:&#13;
1 Global Infrastructure Facili y Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended io be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set oul ii&#13;
Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Fo indational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the GIF Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their collabc n it )n,&#13;
they are of an indicative natu e and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and 0, h&#13;
other potential partners until he GIF is formally established. The final version of these objec i&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend tc work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to fLrther enhance their coordination, in particular by developing th :3,&#13;
with a view to formally establ shing the program by June 2015.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the fore  oing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue to&#13;
collaborate in developing the GIF, including but not limited to:&#13;

sharing best practice and experience with regard to project preparation, through the ko&#13;
of knowledge platforms for the infrastructure sector.&#13;
2.2   During the process of finali::ing the design of the GIF, the multilateral development banks Isl Ad&#13;
in Annex 2 will be invited o participate as initial Technical Partners. Once the GIF de:; iqn is&#13;
finalized, additional collabo ative efforts are required to develop the operational details i0 I ie&#13;
GIF, at all times complementing existing efforts and facilities and building upon the ! hal d&#13;
knowledge and experience of the Parties in this area. This includes determining the I a , of&#13;
coordination between the P arties and project origination process.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Prelirilinary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the 1F is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure prc E'c:&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparatiol,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk r litigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercial r rd&#13;
institutional investor engagement in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex public-private partnerships and projects with potential for commerc a&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastruc u E&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coordil ili: l&#13;
resources in collaboration with the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of the Alil&#13;
range of donor and developn ent finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagerneni c:). d&#13;
stretch from upstream suppo t on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to dowr stream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemei it.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structured&#13;
infrastructure projects, the G F can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset class attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking lc,ng-t:!i ni&#13;
assets in faster growing ecor omies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment oprortunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profiles&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to ooerate according to the following core principles, to be finalizec 1 r n&#13;
agreement among GIF partn irs:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities thE 2. I&#13;
draw together cc mparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing public goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly those&#13;
infrastructure projects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sustainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to bE 3&#13;
practice standar Is for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing tec ha I  al&#13;
and financial resources of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, multi e to al&#13;
development institutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in an&#13;
innovative and flexible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greater&#13;
leverage and adiress the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the reso irces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in th&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF par:riei 3&#13;
are expected to fall into one or more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partners-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF will :'&#13;
considered FundIng Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partnkbrs-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;

activities and/or F rovision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity suppori&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partne rs-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/or institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sove'eign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as well;-.&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure pro ects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparatic n,&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional investment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Cc uncil is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programming&#13;
management and use of funcs, and development of operational policies and procedures; an :&#13;
hold the GIF Management Ur it (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, witl i advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The composil cin )f&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is propos ::H I&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Council comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Direc cr&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facilita E&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve a::&#13;
sounding board, providing gu dance and support for GIF Management, and in particular witV&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be admi iistered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicated e:&#13;
established for this purpose (:he GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fun :t cl&#13;
as a coordinating body as projects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then move&#13;
toward technical support and financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead indi, i It l&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implementation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partner&#13;
institutions, coordinated by tte GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governmeni:&#13;
according to specific project iequirements and the project origination processes. Compositi :r&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and govern r er ts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection criteria and processes could be developed to reflect the followi c0&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Impact-projects that support the development goals of the GIF&#13;
partner institutiot is;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-pro ects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities a id&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-pr)jects that require multiple parties to come together to provide&#13;
structuring, arrar ging and financial support, and/or projects which require a blei c&#13;
financial instrum Dnts; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impac -projects that have significant potential to achieve financial v :yil y,&#13;
leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors-s .i:h&#13;
as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's se vice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastricture investments that have global public good characteristics ;Uh&#13;
as climate friendly-project; that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provision if&#13;
infrastructure services; and ti ade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconneci v t,&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppc rt provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with E vie v&#13;
to complementing the resour:es and support already available from partner entities and oth i&#13;
funding mechanisms. During the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following acti ril ic;,&#13;
corresponding to major proje :t development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scre :i irI&#13;
and legal, regulatory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparati:)n and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and P 3P structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrang ng and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financin .)&#13;
packages from E range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-including in particular the management of environmental and s:)iJ&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastru tui&#13;
projects in supporting sustainable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supportec operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements ft ir&#13;
external implementing entities under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards and :A h -&#13;
standards and policies, and levelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GIF&#13;
Technical Partners who are lxpected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities.&#13;
