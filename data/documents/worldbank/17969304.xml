&#13;
Q: Iâ&#128;&#159;m Jochen Kraske, the Bankâ&#128;&#159;s Historian.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Iâ&#128;&#159;m William Becker, with George Washington University and the Business History Group.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: And Iâ&#128;&#159;m John Cosgrove, presently Executive Director for what is known as the&#13;
Western Pacific Constituency.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, Mr. Cosgrove, itâ&#128;&#159;s a pleasure to meet you. We begin our interviews by asking you to&#13;
very briefly describe your educational background.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I went to a high school in Sydney known as Fort Street Boys High in the late&#13;
1950s, when the school had a strong academic tradition, most noted for producing lawyers in&#13;
Australia. I didnâ&#128;&#159;t become a lawyer. From there, I had studied a little Economics at school and I&#13;
went on to the University of Sydney in 1960 to take an undergraduate degree in Economics,&#13;
which I completed With Honors in 1963. I have not had any postgraduate education of a formal&#13;
kind.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did you meet Mr. [James D.] Wolfensohn, by any chance?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: No. He's older than me, of course, and I'm pretty sure he would have left the&#13;
University by the time I arrived there. He's about ten years older than me, nine or ten years.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What did you do after you received your degree?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Well, that's an interesting point, actually. I didn't have clearly mapped out while&#13;
I was studying at the University any definite career path. In my final year at the University I&#13;
and several of my colleagues were exposed to some fairly persuasive material published by the&#13;
then Australian Department of Overseas Trade and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. This&#13;
material portrayed these institutions as pretty satisfactory employers with intellectually&#13;
stimulating work on their agenda. And I have to say that that's where I and my best friend at the&#13;
time, who in fact came to work at the World Bank himself subsequently, seemed to be heading.&#13;
&#13;
Then, probably in the second half of that final year, a distinguished Australian economist, who&#13;
is now living in Washington also, as it happens, Max Corden, an international trade expert,&#13;
came to give a seminar to the Honors Economics class. He asked what we were all planning to&#13;
do in the way of future employment. He himself, being an academic at the time, was making a&#13;
pitch for some of us to go into academia. Then he went around the table, and people responded&#13;
according to their likely direction. When he heard that several of us were thinking of going to&#13;
work in the Federal Government but in these agencies like the Overseas Trade Department or&#13;
the Agricultural Economics Research Bureau, Max said: â&#128;&#156;Oh, youâ&#128;&#159;d be crazy. If you want to go&#13;
to Canberra and work in the Federal Government, thereâ&#128;&#159;s only one place to work and thatâ&#128;&#159;s the&#13;
Federal Treasury.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
So interestingly I and my best friend, who still were at an impressionable age, naturally, and&#13;
looked up to Professor Corden, said: â&#128;&#156;Oh, well, if he thinks thatâ&#128;&#159;s the right thing to do weâ&#128;&#159;d&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        John Cosgrove&#13;
                                   May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
better do it.â&#128;? So we got in touch with the Federal Treasury, which at the time was having great&#13;
difficulty recruiting people. It had a very poor image as a set of accountants, toting up&#13;
budgetary expenditures and budgetary revenues and finding whether they balanced or deviated.&#13;
But we decided that we should submit ourselves to them at least for an interview. We both went&#13;
to Canberra on the same day and were interviewed by senior members of the Treasury at the&#13;
time. We were both offered positions in the Treasury and we took up our duty on the same day,&#13;
as it happened.&#13;
&#13;
And that's where I have been ever since, with some slight deviations from work in Canberra&#13;
itself with the Treasury, which we can talk about later perhaps, apart from my period working&#13;
here at the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Could you talk a little bit about some of the postings that you had that might have been most&#13;
relevant for your becoming an ED?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes. My first eight or nine years at the Treasury were spent mostly on domestic&#13;
economic analysis and policy issues, but by the time I got into my late twenties I decided I&#13;
wanted to have some exposure to the wider world. The Treasury had a number of posts located&#13;
in our embassies and High Commissions abroad, and I had been very keen to go to London in&#13;
the early 1970s, late 1960s, I've forgotten precisely. That opportunity, however, passed me by,&#13;
and instead I was sent overseas first to work in the Australian Mission to the European&#13;
Community in Brussels. That was 1973. The background to that was that Britain, of course, had&#13;
joined the European Community a year or two earlier. Australiaâ&#128;&#159;s financial relationships with&#13;
the U.K. had always been very close, as you would expect. We were a member of the Overseas&#13;
Sterling Area for several decades, and the Treasury felt that there might be some financial&#13;
policy implications arising out of Britain's entry into the European Community, implications for&#13;
Australia. So they created a new position in Brussels, and I was the first and the only occupant&#13;
of it, as it happened, because after about a year, just over a year in Brussels, I had come to the&#13;
conclusion, with which Canberra agreed, that it just wasnâ&#128;&#159;t a full-time job for a Treasury officer&#13;
on the ground there.&#13;
&#13;
So in 1974, when a vacancy in our delegation to the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-&#13;
operation and Development] in Paris and in our embassy to France emerged, I was transferred&#13;
to Paris. I spent about two years working there, largely in the OECD itself, but I also had a&#13;
certain amount of contact with the French Treasury and Banque de France officials and some of&#13;
the private bankers in Paris, because Australia at that time was a reasonably sizable sovereign&#13;
borrower in overseas markets.&#13;
&#13;
I came back to Australia in '76.&#13;
&#13;
Q: While at the OECD you also participated in the DAC [Development Assistance Committee]&#13;
meetings?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: No. That was handled by the people from our Foreign Affairs Department. The&#13;
development work was still pretty much out of the picture for me. But when I came back to&#13;
&#13;
                                        John Cosgrove&#13;
                                   May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Canberra in 1976 they naturally felt I should be used more on the international side of the&#13;
Department, given this recent experience. It was then that I started to work especially on&#13;
general balance of payments policy issues, but also on international financial institutions, more&#13;
so the International Monetary Fund than the multilateral development banks at that time. But I&#13;
developed a close interest in all of those matters and I think most of my colleagues back home&#13;
would now tag me as a kind of international economic specialist. Even though I have over the&#13;
whole of my time in the Treasury spent long periods working on domestic issues, I've done a lot&#13;
on the international side.&#13;
&#13;
I had a second posting overseas before coming to the Bank and that was in our High&#13;
Commission in London, from 1982 to 1985 . .&#13;
&#13;
Q: So you'd gone back to Canberra in about â&#128;&#158;75 or '76?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: '76. I left again in 1982 to go to London, and returned again in 1985. It was&#13;
while I was in London that I had a lot of exposure to major international economic issues, not&#13;
least because of Britain's membership in the G-7. The British Treasury and the Bank of England&#13;
would be prepared to talk to me about those issues which obviously they were of interest to my&#13;
owners back in Canberra. So I was quite involved in both Fund and World Bank issues at the&#13;
time.&#13;
I also had a lot of exposure with the City at large which educated me a little bit about bond&#13;
raisings and all those kinds of financial activities that the World Bank engages in. My&#13;
operational involvement with the international side then went into a slight period of abeyance.&#13;
After I returned to Canberra, I started working on domestic incomes and related policy issues as&#13;
a member of our main domestic economic policy advising division. Maybe 18 months after I'd&#13;
returned, no more, probably more like 15 months, I was put in charge of the then called&#13;
Overseas Economic Relations Division of the Treasury. I had worked there as a more junior&#13;
officer during the early 1970s, before I went to Brussels and again when I came home from&#13;
Brussels, or from Paris, I should say.&#13;
&#13;
I had that job for less than one year. The head of the Treasury at the time then decided to&#13;
abolish that division, a decision against which I protested strongly. I'm glad to say that it is has&#13;
been recreated in a slightly different form, so Australia's Treasury again has an explicit unit in&#13;
charge of relating to the rest of the world in terms of financial policy issues.&#13;
&#13;
However, I didn't come to the Bank from that area, obviously because it was abolished even&#13;
though its functions went to other parts of the Department. I found myself running a unit of the&#13;
Department called the Economic Division which, again, was very much oriented toward&#13;
domestic macroeconomic policy issues, but had Australia's balance of payments within its fold.&#13;
Finally, for a period of, I think, six to nine months before I came to the Bank I was heading up&#13;
our Fiscal Policy Division.&#13;
&#13;
So the background is somewhat mixed, domestic and international.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You were appointed here in '91.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          John Cosgrove&#13;
                                     May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Correct.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Is there in the Treasury also a Division that deals with Australia's bilateral aid programs?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: No. We have of course a separate Development Assistance Bureau, now known&#13;
as AUSAID, rather like USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development]. The Treasury&#13;
has a group of people who interact with that Bureau, mainly on matters related to multilateral&#13;
aid where the Treasury has more expertise of course than it does on the bilateral side, but they&#13;
also have some involvement in the overall determination of the aid burden.&#13;
&#13;
However, another aspect of Australia's government structure these days is that we have a&#13;
separate Department of Finance, as well as the Treasury. The Department of Finance&#13;
is the agency responsible for expenditure control and oversight of government-owned&#13;
enterprises. It's really the Department of Finance, more than the Treasury, which advises the&#13;
Cabinet on how much money a particular agency, including the Development Agency, should&#13;
receive in a budget. We are in the middle of that right now, and our budget will be announced&#13;
next week.&#13;
&#13;
When I was heading up the Overseas Economic Relations Division, I naturally got involved in a&#13;
lot of that work. I can remember in particular a review of Australia's aid involvement and&#13;
performance. In fact, while I have been here in Washington there have been at least two or three&#13;
of those, and we've undertaken periodic reviews of individual multilateral aid agencies, often&#13;
with a view to deciding whether we should join some or all of them. At the moment, Australia&#13;
has membership, apart from the World Bank Group Development and the Fund, in only the&#13;
Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We are&#13;
not in the Inter-American or the African Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You might want to talk a little bit here about Australia's position vis-a-vis these various&#13;
institutions. I recall at one point you had this mission coming here to evaluate the World Bank&#13;
in comparison with the ADB.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes. There was a fairly serious effort undertaken shortly after I arrived here.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Before we get into that, can I ask a question about the Treasury's philosophical perspective.&#13;
You've been in the Treasury from the early â&#128;&#158;60s until now, and you must have had a pretty good&#13;
view of Australia's evolving philosophical position on economic matters. Can you tell us a little&#13;
bit about this? There must have been a period when the public sector and government control&#13;
played an important role. Has this changed? How has it changed?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: That's an interesting question. When I joined the Treasury I think it would be&#13;
reasonable to depict the economic debate in Australia as a relatively sterile one. We were&#13;
moving towards the end of a long period of macroeconomic stability, driven largely by what&#13;
had been the picture in the major economies, apart from the Korean War which had a big&#13;
impact on our economy of course, given our importance at the time as a wool producer. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OECD world had been essentially growing pretty steadily and in a very low inflation&#13;
environment. And Australia was enjoying that as well. The Treasury was, of course, as you'd&#13;
expect the Treasury to be, very eager to maintain that macroeconomic stability and as a basic&#13;
philosophical position in that regard, nothing has changed. The Treasury is still a very orthodox&#13;
and, in my view, sensible advisor of the Government about the need to keep inflation low and&#13;
to avoid obvious structural imbalances, on the fiscal or the monetary side.&#13;
&#13;
What I think was absent at that time was, as a matter of fact, a focus on the importance of&#13;
microeconomic elements of economic policy. It's true, though, that we had about four or five&#13;
years before I joined the Treasury, undertaken one quite important reform and that was to&#13;
abolish import licensing. This had been used extensively in Australia after the Second World&#13;
War, following the fright which Australia received as a result of being truly isolated from its&#13;
suppliers in the Northern Hemisphere, especially Britain. Politicians came out of that&#13;
experience thinking that we needed to be capable of manufacturing more products to meet our&#13;
domestic needs within Australia, so protective walls had been constructed around almost all&#13;
tradable industries in Australia.&#13;
&#13;
It resulted in a high degree of inefficiency, as you would expect, and weakened Australia's&#13;
economic performance over time. But in '59 or '60, I've forgotten precisely, the Government did&#13;
agree to abolish import licensing and replaced those licenses with tariffs and the Treasury had&#13;
been very instrumental in bringing about that change. So already you are in a period when the&#13;
Treasury is very conscious of the importance of microeconomic matters, but a period in which&#13;
the community at large is sort of still learning about it all.&#13;
&#13;
We then moved into, and now I'm referring to the 1970s essentially, we moved into a very&#13;
difficult period for economic managers, economic advisors perhaps more so than managers.&#13;
There were two major problems. One was the onset of a very substantial, new source of&#13;
income, namely, revenue from domestic oil production. We had had small areas of oil&#13;
production but nothing of any consequence. Then in 1971 or thereabouts what is still our major&#13;
oilfield in Bass Strait, to the south of the mainland, came on stream. BHP and Exxon were the&#13;
two developers of it. This transformed Australia's balance of payments position more or less&#13;
overnight. We went from being a typical net importer of capital with a current account deficit to&#13;
a current account surplus. This didn't last very long, and that was the second major problem.&#13;
There was a tendency to spend our revenue rather freely, as we've seen in a number of other&#13;
similarly placed countries in the Bank's membership, and we quickly found our economy&#13;
moving into a strong inflationary period.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, this was aggravated by the OPEC [Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]&#13;
oil shock in 1973, and then again by the second one in '79, but in the period in between our own&#13;
government compounded things by mishandling the fiscal situation. The outcome by the middle&#13;
of the 1970s was in fact a constitutional crisis which led to the dismissal of the then Prime&#13;
Minister by the then Queen's Representative in Australia, more or less an unprecedented act. It&#13;
divided the country politically and led to a fresh election. T&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        John Cosgrove&#13;
                                   May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
he other side of politics came to power for a time, ran the economy a little better, but then later&#13;
lost their way partly because of the commodity price burn that accompanied the OPEC 1979&#13;
shock. And so we went into the early 1980s really in pretty poor shape and the Treasury had&#13;
been very worried through the whole of that period. Its advice, its basic lines of advice had not&#13;
changed, in my view, during the period. The Treasury continued to be run by very experienced&#13;
and capable bureaucrats who had a deep commitment to the importance of macro stability and&#13;
where the government was willing to do so, microeconomic reforms. But up to that point there&#13;
hadn't been a lot of enthusiasm for microeconomic reforms.&#13;
&#13;
We came into the early 1980s with another change of government when the present Labor&#13;
Government came to office in 1983, so they've had a long run, as you can see. One of the&#13;
changes that shouldn't be overlooked in this whole period is the growing influence of private&#13;
ministerial advisors, typically people who are working in the Minister's office, hired often from&#13;
outside the bureaucracy, and being very close of course on a day-to-day basis with all&#13;
Ministers, not just the Treasuryâ&#128;&#159;s.&#13;
&#13;
This development proved to be of great concern to a man who headed the Treasury from '79 to&#13;
1984 and who is one of my predecessors as an Executive Director of the World Bank. I don't&#13;
know whether you can recall him, Jochen, John Stone. He was in fact a joint ED of the Fund&#13;
and the Bank in the late â&#128;&#158;60s. He felt that it was difficult for a traditional Whitehall Warrior&#13;
type, to use that phrase, to be put in a position of feeling that he should compromise his&#13;
preferred advice to government in order to have that advice accepted.&#13;
&#13;
The Treasury up to that point had been very much an agency which gave a single option to a&#13;
Treasurer, and said: â&#128;&#156;Minister, this is what you must do. There are no alternatives.â&#128;? This was no&#13;
longer what was wanted and John Stone found that pretty hard to live with, I think. He&#13;
resigned from government in 1984, having served at the time I think 30 years to the day as a&#13;
civil servant. I think there you see a bit of a watershed in terms of the Treasury's pattern of&#13;
behavior, a greater willingness to give more than one option to the Minister, whoever it may be,&#13;
and probably more awareness, at least more willingness to respond to perceived political&#13;
difficulties facing the government of the day. In other words, a bit of a shift from, "This is the&#13;
only answer in terms of economic principles. Hereâ&#128;&#159;s an answer which is notâ&#128;? to â&#128;&#156;Here's an&#13;
answer which is not perfect economically but might be what you need to maintain your political&#13;
power.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I don't want to overdramatize that change. I don't think it was a major change, but it was a&#13;
definite change. There you see a bit of a shift in the role of the Treasury. But it has occurred&#13;
without any change in the underlying philosophy of the Treasury, which remains committed to&#13;
those essential economic principles that I mentioned before. It's more a question of the degree&#13;
to which the Department modifies those principles to take account of certain political realities&#13;
of the day. In fact, during the period of the present government, the Treasury has had a much&#13;
more satisfying experience on the microeconomic reform side.&#13;
&#13;
We have removed a lot of structural barriers to economic growth, especially in terms of freeing&#13;
up our market to the rest of the world. Tariffs have come down from very high levels to now&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
levels which are more or less in line with those of the OECD countries at large. We have no&#13;
quotas on imports at all now.&#13;
&#13;
Transport policy, communications policy, education policy have all been the subject of major&#13;
reforms. Our health system has undergone major reforms. Some of the groundwork for that was&#13;
in fact laid during the 1970s when an independent agency, which has had various labels over&#13;
the years but is now known as the Industry Commission, progressively through a series of high&#13;
quality reports managed to educate both the Parliament and the community about the costs of&#13;
high protection, and so the public debate gradually became of higher quality. The forces of&#13;
permanent protection were pushed to the back. Consumer advocates became more influential.&#13;
Over the last decade or 12 years we've reaped some of the benefits of that intellectual effort&#13;
through the 1970s and 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So you were sympathetic to these changes and brought this vision to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes, I think so. Yes. As Iâ&#128;&#159;ve mentioned earlier this morning, we have a chair&#13;
now which is occupied one term by an Australian and then by a New Zealander and then by a&#13;
Korean. There will be subtle differences of shading in terms of views expressed at the Board&#13;
table by each of us, but the Australian and New Zealander approach is a very similar one. You&#13;
are no doubt familiar with the dramatic economic policy shifts implemented in New Zealand&#13;
over the last decade. The Koreans are not quite of the same mind but they are basically looking&#13;
in the same direction. This is a standard approach to important policy issues on the Bank's&#13;
agenda which you'll hear from this chair I hope for some time.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Coming into the Bank as an ED in '91, what did you want to accomplish? What did you set&#13;
as your agenda?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Well, I'm lucky that, in the sense that my arrival coincided pretty closely with&#13;
that of Lew [Lewis T.] Preston's. Perhaps for quite different reasons we had as a major priority&#13;
the same objective, and that was to improve the quality of the World Bank's assistance. I came&#13;
here with a view that the Bank, and I remain of this view, that the Bank is too focused on the&#13;
transfer of financial resources, making loans or credits to its member countries. Now, lending is&#13;
of course an important part of the Bank's operations, but I perceived from my perch in Canberra&#13;
that the Bank as an institution had been too focused on these financial transfers, and not&#13;
sufficiently focused on what we are actually achieving in the recipient countries in terms of&#13;
their own speed of economic development. Of course, the area that stands out, it stood out then&#13;
and still does, is Sub-Saharan Africa where there is all sorts of help and still very little progress.&#13;
&#13;
Lew, I think, came with the perspective of a commercial banker who naturally has an eagle eye&#13;
on the quality of his assets from year to year. I was looking at it more from the point of view of&#13;
an economist and seeing scarce resources not being used productively. So that was a major&#13;
objective.&#13;
&#13;
A second objective, which actually had come to the fore of the policy debate more than I might&#13;
have expected, was the matter of administrative resources that the Bank itself had at its&#13;
&#13;

                                     May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
disposal. My chair has a long history of being uncontent with the size of remuneration increases&#13;
paid to Fund and Bank staff, and to Executive Directors for that matter. My Governor has been&#13;
voting against my pay increases in recent years, but Australia has been running this line for a&#13;
long time. I felt it was right and I've maintained that line.&#13;
&#13;
I took a firm approach to the Bank's budgets in general while I've been here. I've abstained or&#13;
opposed on several though I can't recall precisely how many. I've felt that we as an institution&#13;
were just too big and a little too spendthrift in the way resources are used. There have been a&#13;
number of initiatives taken during the last several years. We've cut out our first-class travel&#13;
entitlement. We've put the budget into neutral, at least, and it's now headed into absolute&#13;
decline over the next few years.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did you take a lead among the EDs on this issue?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Well, I wouldn't claim to be a leader but I was very active and I think I was&#13;
generally perceived as a bit of an instigator on this subject.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Your perception that resource transfers were not the answer or the only answer, was this&#13;
your own perception? Or was this a line that the Australian Treasury had taken?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: It does.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And secondly, was there any particular incidents that had brought this to the surface in your&#13;
mind or in the minds of the government?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Well, again, you are going back to the underlying economic philosophy of the&#13;
Treasury. We have a strong view that self help is basically going to take you a long way. When&#13;
it came of course to see international trading arrangements in particular as open and free as&#13;
possible, that will help all of us. But essentially if you want to develop quickly you can do the&#13;
job by and large yourself. And I think that applies to almost any country.&#13;
&#13;
We have also always held the view that what really matters for any country in the process of&#13;
development, and I include in that category even the richest of our members, the United States&#13;
for example, is a sensible, rational economic framework, and, particularly, now I'm referring to&#13;
the poorer countries because they do need a lot of investment capital, to try to create an&#13;
environment in which private investors are willing to come and help them develop.&#13;
&#13;
This is the Australian experience. We haven't always got our policy settings right, as I've&#13;
explained a moment ago, but by and large we have been open to private capital from abroad, for&#13;
virtually the whole of our period. We've gone through relatively short periods when concerns&#13;
about foreign ownership and control have become of greater importance and the government&#13;
has put in place certain mechanisms to try to curb its flow for a while. That was particularly&#13;
important following the breakdown of the par value system when money of a rather loose kind&#13;
was looking for places to reside. We used capital controls, capital inflow controls fairly&#13;
extensively during that period, for example.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But we do feel that with the right policies, which in my view organizations like the Fund and&#13;
the Bank have a major role in bringing about, and with a sensible base for interacting with&#13;
foreign investors and traders, itâ&#128;&#159;s really going to be hard to stop an economy from developing.&#13;
If youâ&#128;&#159;ve got that framework, chances are things will work pretty well.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of specific experiences, I think the main one I would identify, and here Iâ&#128;&#159;m telling tales&#13;
out of school a little bit, is the experience of some of the very countries I represent at the Bank,&#13;
the small Pacific Island countries in particular. They have received large amounts of external&#13;
assistance from my own country, from New Zealand, in more recent years from countries like&#13;
Japan and the European Community, and they are not developing. Their per capita income has&#13;
been stagnant for a decade or more. They are not in a situation where they really need to&#13;
improve the quality of their own domestic economic policies because the foreign aid comes&#13;
year in and year out. Itâ&#128;&#159;s not a high standard of living, donâ&#128;&#159;t misunderstand me on that. These&#13;
people need to develop. It's a passable standard of living, but for many of the people there it's&#13;
still a subsistence type of existence. There's fresh fruit, fish in the sea, and they can grow some&#13;
root crops and so on, so it's viable. Those cases are replicated on a much more significant scale&#13;
in other parts of the world where fresh nutritious food is not so readily available but where, to&#13;
my eyes, the progress of development has been much slower than I'd like to see it be. So I think&#13;
the Bank could do better. Of course, we can only go as fast as the recipient countries&#13;
themselves are willing to run, but we should be trying to do more to bring about sound&#13;
economic policy frameworks in those countries. Rather than saying Country X has a balance of&#13;
payments financing gap of Y and we together with the IMF and various other donors must fill&#13;
that gap, which I think is not very constructive, we should insist on sound economic policies.&#13;
&#13;
Q: From the institutional side that is, of course, you know, a major problem in many of these&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: You mean the lack of institutional expertise. Oh, I agree.&#13;
&#13;
Q: The absence of functioning institutions and skilled administrators and managers.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes. Well, I think that's again another reason why the financial transfers&#13;
approach hasn't worked. I think what we've tended to mix up is on the one hand the very&#13;
obvious needs for development assistance, but on the other the rather different capacity to&#13;
absorb development assistance. It's the latter that should be the determinant in my view of the&#13;
pace of external assistance, not just the Bank's but of all donors.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Do you see a role for the Bank and the Fund in this process of capacity building?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I do, but I must say, this is one of the surprises that I've had while I've been&#13;
here, and that is that we seem to be pretty bad at that. Not just us. I think donor performance in&#13;
technical assistance doesn't seem to be very satisfactory. There are some obvious reasons why&#13;
technical assistance has not worked. I think there's been a tendency for the technical assistance&#13;
to be driven by the agendas of the donors as distinguished from the needs and agendas of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
recipients. I think we've now learned that lesson. But beyond that, one looks at annual reports&#13;
on technical assistance done by this Bank and DAC reports and one gains the impression that&#13;
these scarce resources are not being used to great effect. However, I firmly believe that the&#13;
multilateral aid agencies, those that at least I've had experience with, are still genuine forces for&#13;
good in the world. What concerns me is that we could be doing better.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You mentioned your responsibilities for the various countries that you represent. We would&#13;
be interested to know how you balance the varying interests of these different constituencies?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Well, I'm glad to say that that hasn't really been a problem at all. When I arrived&#13;
I had essentially two donor countries in my group, Australia and New Zealand. Now, of course&#13;
Korea is emerging as a donor country as well. It had in fact contributed funds to IDA&#13;
[International Development Association] for a number of replenishments, albeit on a very small&#13;
scale. Otherwise I had a constituency which is made up, for the most part of small countries,&#13;
certainly countries with small populations and in many cases small land areas as well, who were&#13;
borrowers from the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
I must say I've always been troubled by this labeling of Bank shareholders as Part I or Part II.&#13;
I've never been one who sees the interests of donors and recipients in any sense in conflict. If&#13;
we can help the poor countries to develop faster, that will be of great assistance to the rich&#13;
countries. The poor countries will have more income to spend on some of the things that the&#13;
rich countries produce and in time, as the poor countries become richer, they will have things to&#13;
offer to us, even in terms of investing in our own countries, which in earlier times they were&#13;
never able to do.&#13;
&#13;
So that's been my starting point, that it doesn't matter whom I'm representing. We are all in the&#13;
same boat, and the faster all of us manage our economic development the better it will be for&#13;
the whole lot of us.&#13;
&#13;
Now, it is really very hard for me to think of any periods in which I've felt myself torn between&#13;
the interests of my various shareholders. To be honest, I think that the main problems of that&#13;
kind have actually been with my major shareholder, which sometimes doesn't have the same&#13;
view as I have of Bank policy issues.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Such as . . .?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Oh, well, environmental issues are one major example. Australia now, like most&#13;
of the industrial donor countries, is under increasing political pressure from environmental non-&#13;
government agencies to have the Bank cease undertaking projects like big dams or development&#13;
projects which are going to require resettlement of people or knocking down of some trees to&#13;
allow a new road to go in and things like that. That political pressure is often significant and&#13;
relevant agencies, central policy agencies in Canberra and their Ministers, feel that they should&#13;
encourage me to not support projects of that kind. The Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada in&#13;
India is a classic example of course. But very soon after my arrival I had the Pak Mun dam case&#13;
in Thailand on my plate. In the end, I did oppose or abstain on that project on instructions from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          John Cosgrove&#13;
                                     May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Canberra. I sought instructions because I found myself in a situation where I could see the&#13;
severe difficulties associated with the issue in Canberra. I had a different view but I felt this was&#13;
very early in my time that I should accommodate them as well as I might. But I did not want to&#13;
oppose that project without being instructed to do so, and I told them I would not unless they&#13;
instructed me to do so. That's the only time I have ever received an instruction from any of my&#13;
authorities. I'm very grateful to them, I must say. On the whole they have confidence in the&#13;
office and they essentially leave us to do the job. Canberra's attitude has always been, we are&#13;
sending responsible people here to do the job, you do it. You'll hear from us when we need to&#13;
contact you.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So your only instructions were self-generated on a really serious issue?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes. My approach of course had been founded on what I know at the other end&#13;
of the telephone as the basic multilateral financial institutions agenda for Australia.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there was another development that I should mention here. I've forgotten the origins of&#13;
this. It may have resided in the appointment of Australia's first Executive Director to the&#13;
European Bank. But anyway, whatever the origins, I did receive and still have a charter from&#13;
Canberra about how I should conduct myself and what issues are important. I was given the&#13;
charter in draft form and made a number of comments on it. It causes me no difficulty&#13;
whatsoever except in one respect and that is the increasing evidence and emphasis given by&#13;
Australia to procurement matters, which I see as a very peripheral part of my role as an&#13;
Executive Director. I'm in the fortunate position that my Australian authorities have an official&#13;
representative located in our embassy whose responsibilities include work on procurement with&#13;
the Bank and the United Nations. So, essentially I leave that to him actually.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I may get involved because the Bank's procurement procedures have not been&#13;
followed precisely but otherwise all the work on the details of procurement matters are done by&#13;
that man.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, this charter is limited to Australia. The Koreans and the New Zealanders haven't given&#13;
you a similar charter?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: No. When the Australian charter was being finalized, I made a point of ensuring&#13;
that Canberra understood that I was not Australia's ambassador in the Bank. I was representing&#13;
at that time I think about 10 countries, it's now 12. I emphasized that I do have to take account&#13;
of the views of them all in circumstances where they might differ. More importantly, I've&#13;
always had uppermost in my mind that I am a member of the Executive Board. I'm not an&#13;
ambassador from any of the countries that I represent. I represent them, but Iâ&#128;&#159;m an individual&#13;
member of the Bank's Board and Iâ&#128;&#159;m an official of the Bank. I'm not paid by Australia or any&#13;
other country that I represent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I think actually thatâ&#128;&#159;s one of the mundane weaknesses of the Board, that there's a tendency&#13;
among members to feel as though we are ambassadors, but we are not.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Talking about the other development organizations now, we wanted to ask you about&#13;
Australia's role in the Asian Development Bank. Do you think that your countryâ&#128;&#159;s role is going&#13;
to grow there, and if it does, what impact is this likely to have on Australia's role in the World&#13;
Bank? Or in IDA of course?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Of course, we are a much bigger stakeholder in the Asian Development Bank&#13;
than we are in this Bank. I think we are the third largest shareholder in the Asian Bank, behind&#13;
the United States and Japan, whereas here we are about number 12 or maybe now a little lower.&#13;
Our share of capital in Manila I believe is about six percent of the total. Here it's about one and&#13;
a half. So there is a difference of scale already.&#13;
&#13;
The Asian Development Bank's Executive Board is much smaller. Our Board here is too big for&#13;
my liking. So this gives the third largest shareholder a certain weight of voice simply as a&#13;
matter of financial contributions and sheer voting power, not that, of course, votes are very&#13;
often, if at all, used in the Executive Board.&#13;
&#13;
But beyond all of that, I think it would be the case that our role in the Asian Development Bank&#13;
is a more influential one. Influence I think does depend quite a bit on the personal qualities of&#13;
Board members. It's for others to judge how influential our chair has been in recent years in the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
I don't see the involvement of Australia in the Asian Bank as a great threat to Australia's role in&#13;
the World Bank. The most important reason for that view is that there is still, within official&#13;
circles, a good deal of support for the role of the World Bank as the major multilateral&#13;
development assistance agency. The World Bank does things, has the capacity to do things&#13;
which the regional development banks do not possess. Without wanting to harp on a theme, I&#13;
think what this organization's real comparative advantage is, lies in the area of assisting and&#13;
persuading recipient governments to put in place better economic policy frameworks. We have&#13;
a truly global background of experience in economic policy advice, in understanding of national&#13;
economic situations, which by definition a regional bank won't have. So that is why there is a&#13;
strong body of support for the World Bank's role in that field. And the Asian Development&#13;
Bank at least has not been very well set up on that side at all. It's improving now. Their&#13;
economic prowess has been improved to a greater degree in the last five years or so, but it's still&#13;
nowhere near the quality of this Bank's.&#13;
&#13;
Quite a different concern is, and this is a development which has disappointed me, that in both&#13;
of those two Banks Australia's financial input is declining. It's declining in part for natural&#13;
reasons, and that is that the economic capacity of other shareholders is advancing faster than&#13;
Australia's is, so our ability to maintain our shareholdings in these organizations is gradually&#13;
dropping. But there have been also discretionary decisions in Canberra in the last four years,&#13;
while I've been here, which have led to lower contributions, including to the soft windows of&#13;
both of the organizations. In IDA-10, for example, Australia cut its contribution from two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
percent to one and a half. There was a similar cut in Australia's contribution to the Asian&#13;
Development Fund in '92, at about much the same time.&#13;
&#13;
Here of course the size of our capital contribution is greater, even though we are a smaller&#13;
contributor in terms of our burden share. But when it comes to the World Bank, you are talking&#13;
about fairly big budgetary outlays. So Australia, for domestic budgetary reasons, decided not to&#13;
complete its subscription to the most recent general capital increase of IBRD. That was a&#13;
conscious decision to forego some voting power in order to save some money. Even more&#13;
worrisome was a decision to contribute not at all to the IFC's current general capital increase.&#13;
&#13;
I don't believe that similar actions on the core institution component, IBRD-IFC in our case,&#13;
have happened at the Asian Development Bank yet, but they may. The Asian Development&#13;
Bank is now in the process of putting in place its next general capital increase. It will be&#13;
interesting to see how Australia reacts to that.&#13;
&#13;
I think what we've tended to do, if I could just comment in my answer, is to be fairly selective&#13;
in our commitment to multilateral institutions. As I said, we've not joined the African&#13;
Development Bank. We've not joined the Inter-American Development Bank. There was a very&#13;
strong debate in Canberra as to whether we should join the European Bank. In the end, for&#13;
political reasons we decided we should. Now you see an emerging debate about the possibility&#13;
of establishing a development bank in the Middle East. That again would be a contentious issue&#13;
in Australia.&#13;
&#13;
But for the time being, because we are only in three of them we have been able, with the&#13;
qualifications which are not unimportant that I just mentioned, to maintain an active interest in&#13;
the agencies of which we are a member. I would see competition to Australia's role in the&#13;
World Bank being more under threat if decisions were taken to join a larger number of&#13;
multilateral agencies, which I think would be a pity and I would be arguing against that.&#13;
&#13;
Q: When you talk about debate of these issues, is that a debate among officials in the Treasury,&#13;
or among politicians. or among the public at large?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: It's mainly the former. It's a debate within official circles because to some extent&#13;
these institutions are still seen by the man in the street as a little arcane, though increasingly the&#13;
NGOs are taking an interest. Australian NGOs at least tend to see their interests lying on the&#13;
bilateral side of the national aid burden. They feel they get more benefit directly out of that than&#13;
they get out of contributions to multilateral agencies. So they are starting to emerge as a factor.&#13;
They say, why should we join a new multilateral, or contribute to an existing one when the aid&#13;
burden in total is still under considerable pressure.&#13;
&#13;
You might be interested to know, for example, that the present level of Australia's official&#13;
development assistance in real terms is below what it was 10 years ago. There are too many&#13;
countries in that position, I think. This is one of the reasons for those decisions on the World&#13;
Bank size that I mentioned.&#13;

Q: Talking about Australia's part of the world, because of regional interests do you think that&#13;
Australia is going to find itself agreeing with more frequently, or working more closely with&#13;
Japan?&#13;

COSGROVE: Oh, yes, undoubtedly. There has already emerged, a semi-institutional&#13;
framework, the Association of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. This is still a label and&#13;
they haven't yet set themselves up on an OECD-type basis. They may never do so, but it is&#13;
cementing relations at the highest political level, the Prime Minister in our case, and in Japan's&#13;
case.&#13;
&#13;
Mind you, many people have never kept abreast of the rapid growth in economic exchange of&#13;
all kinds between Australia and the Asian countries. Japan has been Australia's biggest export&#13;
market for decades. People tend to think still our most important economic links are with&#13;
Britain or at least Europe or maybe the United States, but Japan is far and away Australia's&#13;
biggest trade partner.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What are they buying?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Oh, it's commodities essentially. It used to be wool predominantly, but&#13;
increasingly it's metals and minerals and more in the way of meats going in there now. The&#13;
Japanese have reduced some of their restrictions in that area. And the same is true in Korea.&#13;
Korea is now Australia's second biggest export market. These countries also provide Australia&#13;
with a lot of Australia's imports. And there is a lot of investment both ways. It's mainly coming&#13;
into Australia, I think, rather than going out from Australia because Australia is still a country&#13;
where investment opportunities exceed our willingness to save domestically so we draw&#13;
persistently on foreign savings.&#13;
&#13;
Q: New Zealand follows the same pattern, doesn't it?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes. So, the APEC arrangement which began in â&#128;&#158;89, already six years ago, was&#13;
cementing in place at the political level a relationship at the economic level which has been&#13;
under way really since the â&#128;&#158;60s, but with some rapidity since the mid-â&#128;&#158;70s or thereabouts.&#13;
Certainly, since the oil price shocks when Japan decided, in our case particularly, it needed to&#13;
move away from a high dependence on oil as an energy source toward things like coal.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You talked a little bit about Australia's decision not to fully fund its share of the general&#13;
capital increase. The contribution to IDA has been going down also.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: It was too high, of course, for too long.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I wanted to ask why it has been going down? You alluded to some domestic financial&#13;
reasons. Can you elaborate?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I think it's essentially a budgetary problem. When IDA was first replenished&#13;
Australia had a share of the order of 2-1/4 percent, and it stayed very close to that for a long&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          John Cosgrove&#13;
                                     May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
time. In fact it was still two percent in IDA-9, which was completed in 1989. Iâ&#128;&#159;m prepared to&#13;
say that the wish of Australian officials at that time, IDA-9, was to cut our share because our&#13;
economic capacity to contribute had diminished. There was a need to adjust our burden share.&#13;
But the President of the Bank at the time, Mr. [Barber B.] Conable, apparently made a skillful&#13;
telephone call to Australiaâ&#128;&#159;s Treasurer at a critical point right in the negotiations of the&#13;
replenishment and managed to persuade Australia to maintain its share at two percent, 1.99 to&#13;
be precise.&#13;
&#13;
So we went into IDA-10, still with this history of two percent or thereabouts, notwithstanding&#13;
the fact that our IBRD share had gone down quite a lot over a period of 20 or 30 years. That&#13;
was another part of the background of the cut to one and a half in IDA-10, with those budgetary&#13;
pressures that I mentioned being really the driving force. There was a feeling, particularly in&#13;
our Aid Bureau, that multilateral aid was starting to reach such a high level as to reduce the&#13;
amount of flexibility that they wanted to have on the bilateral side. Our commitments to IDA&#13;
take a long time to be paid and they had been rising to IDA-10 in real terms. Now they've&#13;
stabilized and they are almost certainly going to fall in the current replenishment. But&#13;
nonetheless our Aid Bureau saw that multilateral commitment as being uncomfortably high and&#13;
diminishing the capacity to work on development projects that have the name of the Australian&#13;
Government written on the wall of the dam or the side of the high school or something.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Are you in close touch with your IDA Deputy? I suppose that is handled from the Treasury?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: No. The IDA Deputy these days is from the Aid Bureau, and has been I think&#13;
for a fair time. I actually sat through the IDA-10 negotiations from beginning to end and&#13;
therefore had a lot of contact with him. I regret to say that I wasn't as influential from IDA's&#13;
point of view as I had hoped to be, although I managed to get a little more than might have been&#13;
otherwise the case.&#13;
&#13;
One of the difficulties that Australia had in IDA-10 was that it kept changing its Deputy and so&#13;
I in effect became the point of continuity in that negotiation. But it was a back chair role that I&#13;
was playing.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In that same context, does Australia look at its participation in an autonomous kind of way?&#13;
I mean, you decide for your own reasons what, if anything, we contribute, and we don't pay any&#13;
attention to the decisions taken by others?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I think you are right. We decide for our own reasons, which is perhaps not what&#13;
it should be, but that's what it is.&#13;
&#13;
Q: One of the themes that we are interested in talking to EDs about is how the Board itself has&#13;
worked. So one of our questions is with whom among the EDs did you work most closely?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: A variety of people at any time, but because members of the Board come and&#13;
go, you develop personal links with some from a particular chair and not with their successor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
for that constituency. Not surprisingly the ones I would instinctively mention are the Anglo-&#13;
Saxon Executive Directors. You have a natural affinity with them, of course. Within that Anglo&#13;
Saxon group, you might think mainly, if you are coming from Australia, of the British and the&#13;
Canadians, but I've had a lot to do with the U.S. office, more than I might have expected&#13;
actually when I came. Again, it's a personal kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
Q: That was [E. Patrick] Coady at first?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I had a very good relationship with Coady and his Alternate also, with some of&#13;
the staff in the U.S. office. I think they are very high quality.&#13;
&#13;
I've had a lot of contact with the Scandinavian office, partly because they used to reside near&#13;
me, but more importantly than that, we had common interests in a lot of Bank policy issues and&#13;
they are very nice people to work with. Both Indian Executive Directors I've had a good deal of&#13;
personal contact with. The Chinese as well.&#13;
&#13;
I'd guess that those that Iâ&#128;&#159;ve had the least active personal relationships with may be those from&#13;
South America and some of the Western Europeans. Yet, as I say that I think of Nicolas Flano,&#13;
who was one of my best friends. He used to be the Alternate and then the Executive Director&#13;
for the chair that has Chile, his country, in it. A lot of chairs tend to change their members quite&#13;
frequently, and that's a bit of an impediment to some extent to developing very close personal&#13;
relationships.&#13;
&#13;
I don't know whether I've succeeded, but I've tried to make myself available and open to all of&#13;
my colleagues and while I was chairman of the Board's Administrative Committee I naturally&#13;
had to deal a lot with the Board as a whole. We were facing some touchy issues such as the first&#13;
class travel business, and the even more touchy issue of whether or not we should be allowed to&#13;
smoke in our own offices, such triviality. I couldn't imagine that it would generate so much heat&#13;
but it did.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Otherwise, you'll have all these people going down in the elevator all the time to smoke&#13;
somewhere else outside the building.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes. I'm now, to my amazement, the third most senior member of the Board.&#13;
This really struck me as not a very good thing for the Board. We turn over too quickly. So that&#13;
means I have known most of the people since they came here and I think I know them all now&#13;
quite well. The people in the Middle East, for instance. I've had a lot to do with Ibrahim Al-&#13;
Assaf. Before him, with Fawzi Al-Sultan, who used to live next door, and now with Al-Khaled.&#13;
So I think I've had pretty good and extensive relationships with virtually the whole of the&#13;
Board, but there's no doubt that it is that Anglo-Saxon mob that would be the closest.&#13;
&#13;
I've found something I can say in the nature of a soul mate in Enzo Grilli, the present Italian&#13;
Executive Director. He too is a trained economist and we tend to think in similar terms. We are&#13;
often talking to each other about how to handle particular issues. Whereas I had not a great deal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to do with his predecessor, also an economist; we just didn't seem to develop the same kind of&#13;
personal rapport, but we were friends.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What about Board procedures and structures? One of the things we are interested in is the&#13;
work of the ad hoc committee that was convened to review Board procedures.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: And produced the Haralz-Naim report. Well, that was underway of course when&#13;
I arrived. I remember being somewhat mystified when I was exposed to the issue in my first&#13;
months here. I remember David Peretz, the then U.K. ED coming across, we'd known each&#13;
other from my time in London, and trying to bring me up to speed on it, and seek my support&#13;
for the changes that they were planning to introduce. The work of that committee of course&#13;
went on for some time and it was probably well into 1992 before it was finally put to the Board&#13;
for approval. I became a strong supporter of what was recommended. To this day I remain&#13;
staggered that some of the points of resistance continue, particularly as regards whether or not&#13;
the Board should approve country assistance strategies as distinct from merely having a&#13;
discussion of them. It seems to me utterly ridiculous, to be honest, that the Executive Board&#13;
would not approve the institution's strategy for a member country. Of course, I've heard the&#13;
reasons why there was resistance to that idea. I remain puzzled by them, but I understand them&#13;
better now. The other point that's a bit funny is the notion which we are now overthrowing, I'm&#13;
glad to say, that we cannot discuss a country assistance strategy except in the context of a&#13;
particular loan to be approved by the Board.&#13;
&#13;
I think that the people on that committee and, of course, the Boardâ&#128;&#159;s endorsement of it did our&#13;
successors a real service because I can see that the way in which the Board now spends its time,&#13;
and the matters which Board members discuss amongst themselves in the corridors is much&#13;
more productive than it was when I arrived. Then it pretty largely was: â&#128;&#156;Hereâ&#128;&#159;s a loan to&#13;
Argentina, please approve.â&#128;? â&#128;&#156;Hereâ&#128;&#159;s another credit to Mozambique, please approve.â&#128;? We were&#13;
having policy discussions. Every year we were discussing the budget and how to allocate the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#159;s net income and other matters, like forestry policy, on an ad hoc basis. But now the&#13;
Board is much more, what I believe to be the right role for an Executive Board, in the center&#13;
and spending most of its time discussing policy issues.&#13;
&#13;
There is a view, which Iâ&#128;&#159;m still not comfortable with, that the Board could cease to discuss loan&#13;
approvals and instead hold management accountable periodically to a discussion of how&#13;
managementâ&#128;&#159;s issuing of loans is going on. The Bankâ&#128;&#159;s Articles I think are a bit of a problem&#13;
there, but I also think there is some value in the Board having discussions of particular projects.&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#159;s too easy for us to become exclusively policy-oriented people. The lending operations of the&#13;
Bank are important, and I personally attach importance to them, notwithstanding what I had to&#13;
say about economic reforms being more important.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So you would say that these reforms have in fact improved the relationship between&#13;
management and the Board?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I think so, but this is still a relationship which is not as good as it should be.&#13;
This may well stem from the very early conflict between the Bank's first President and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bank's first Executive Board in 1946. I suspect that the experience so scarred the senior&#13;
managers of the Bank at the time that they had carved in a marble plate "Absolutely ensure that&#13;
we, not the Board, run this institution." And that is the case.&#13;
&#13;
I regret to have to say that I think the Board is weak. One of course is finding pretty soon after&#13;
arriving here, if you hadn't learned of it before, that many of the representatives of the&#13;
borrowing countries feel to some extent beholden to management for fear that if they kick up a&#13;
fuss they might get less in the way of loans from the Bank as a kind of a reprisal. I know there&#13;
have been some very unsavory, unforgivable actions by senior management over the years,&#13;
when a borrowing country ED causes trouble somebody on Bank management rings his capital&#13;
and says â&#128;&#156;Pull your ED into line.â&#128;? If I were on the other end of the telephone in the capital, I'd&#13;
have my Executive Director lobbying for the removal of the person initiating that telephone&#13;
call, but that's not the way it works.&#13;
&#13;
So the Board should be more determined about its role as the decision-making body of this&#13;
organization except of course for the decisions which are reserved by the Board of Governors to&#13;
themselves. I think things are getting better because as a result of the Haralz-Naim reforms the&#13;
Board is now at least in a position to be more influential on the policy side. The two-stage&#13;
process of approval of a new Bank policy which was put in place by that report changes the&#13;
situation from one in which management comes to the Board on a "take it or leave it" basis with&#13;
a proposal, which the Board over the years typically has accepted, to a situation where we have&#13;
a preliminary discussion, without recommendations from management, during which the Board&#13;
can say, â&#128;&#156;Well, if you think you are on the right track, please go ahead as fast as you can,â&#128;? or&#13;
â&#128;&#156;We've got another way that we think this issue should be handled. Put your thinking cap on&#13;
and come back to us taking account of what we've said.â&#128;? That's an important change. It puts the&#13;
Board in a position to have a lot more influence than it previously might have had. I don't know&#13;
yet that we are really using that position as well as we might, but the opportunity is now there.&#13;
&#13;
The other weakness I believe of Board/Management relations is the still relatively limited&#13;
informal contact. I had expected when I came here that every month at least the President or&#13;
one of his senior sidekicks would just get the Board together and say, â&#128;&#156;Well, look, here's an&#13;
issue emerging that we hadn't expected to emerge, and this is how we think it might be handled.&#13;
We'd better go away and write a paper for you, but meanwhile, you might like to think about&#13;
this, give us your ideas and so on.â&#128;? There's not much of that. There may be more of it going on&#13;
than I'm aware of with the G-7 countries. They are still right in the center of things in a way.&#13;
But Board members like myself are not automatically included. We have to work our way to&#13;
find out what is going on. From some of the things I hear from some of my G-7 colleagues, it's&#13;
not even all of them that are in that circle. I think it should be part of an organization of this&#13;
kind. You can run an organization like the Bank satisfactorily and give the shareholders'&#13;
representatives a sense of active involvement. But simply getting them to sit down at the Board&#13;
table and approve a set of recommendations every now and then, that's just a funny way to run a&#13;
railroad to me.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What about the Board itself? When you referred earlier to the fact that you thought it was far&#13;
too large to function what did you have in mind? There are also constitutional or institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
issues that somehow limit the effectiveness of the Board to function, the way it is constituted,&#13;
the way people are selected to serve on the Board, that impose a limit on its effectiveness. Don't&#13;
you think so?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: That's a hard question to answer, Jochen. I'm not sure I'm sufficiently steeped in&#13;
the history of the Bank's activities over the decades to really know. There is one institutional&#13;
problem which I mentioned before that I would prefer to see dropped, and that is the Part I, Part&#13;
II categorization. I think it does tend to create a divide within the Board, not in all&#13;
circumstances, but there is a sort of a "them" and "us" feeling which Iâ&#128;&#159;ve tried to get away from&#13;
in the small committee, Committee on Committees, as it's called, that was chaired by Jorunn&#13;
Maehlum last year. We recommended that the Part I, Part II nomenclature be dropped. It has a&#13;
legal basis in IDA, but apart from that, as far as I can see there's no legal foundation at all. We&#13;
were reporting on Board committees so what we were specifically suggesting was that the even-&#13;
handed membership, Part I, Part II of each committee could be dispensed with. Of course, it&#13;
hasn't been, at least I don't think it has, but that would be one change I would propose.&#13;
&#13;
The other one that occurs to me is, again, a point Iâ&#128;&#159;ve already mentioned and that is that it does&#13;
seem to me to be now a strong practice on the part of many members of the Board to be driven&#13;
to a large extent by views coming out of capitals. Now, that's important. I always welcome&#13;
whatever I get from any of the capitals, although it's really only Canberra that ever provides&#13;
much in the way of briefing. But I always do with that what I want to do. I don't just conclude:&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Oh, yes, I must put that in my statement.â&#128;? To that extent, we are not really playing the role for&#13;
which we are intended, and in the process we are not really acting as Bank officials. We are&#13;
parading views that some of our most important shareholders might have and therefore they are&#13;
important in themselves, but the Board should be capable of formulating its own views on&#13;
particular issues, not merely trotting out views that are coming out of its capitals. I can imagine&#13;
the latter being more important, say, in the context of an IDA negotiation where it literally is&#13;
national budget money that is providing the wherewithal. Of course, on the IBRD side, without&#13;
the shareholders' backing the Bank's bonds they would have a higher price attached to them on&#13;
issue than they would have otherwise, sorry, a lower price or a higher interest rate. This does&#13;
worry me a bit. I've mentioned it in one or two informal Board discussions, this distinction&#13;
between the role as a member of an institution and as an ambassador representing the views of a&#13;
shareholder.&#13;
&#13;
Q: But isn't that really what underlies this tension between the Bank management and the&#13;
Board?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: It probably does, but there is a basic power kick there as well. And you don't&#13;
have to look very hard to find the reasons why. Management are making a career of their role in&#13;
the Bank. It's well known that the rate of staff turn-over in the Bank and the Fund is probably as&#13;
low as in any institution on the planet. In contrast, as I've said, I'm now the third longest-serving&#13;
Executive Director with still a bit less than four years under my belt. For me and my colleagues&#13;
it's a passing opportunity to be in a stimulating and important institution and try to make it a&#13;
little better. We know that the axe is going to fall on us sooner rather than later, and we'll be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
back home, probably a year in many cases, having nothing whatsoever to do with the World&#13;
Bank. I, for example, don't expect I will be involved with the Bank when get home.&#13;
&#13;
It's a bit different I think for the developing country representatives. Many of them will go back&#13;
and work in their Finance Ministries as direct interlocutors with the Bank. So the priority that&#13;
management attaches to being able to keep the Bank on the path they believe it should take is&#13;
higher than it is for a Board member. I don't say that in any malicious way, and I'm not saying&#13;
that management wants power simply for the sake of having power. I think they have a&#13;
seriously considered, genuine commitment to the Bank and their view of what it should be. But&#13;
for them, because they are going to be here for 15 or 20 years, it's more important that they get&#13;
their way than it is for somebody who's here for two years, or even maybe four years. That's I&#13;
think the essence of it.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What about the role of the President in creating this tension? The reason I ask is because&#13;
both [Alden W.] Clausen and Preston were mystified by having to deal with a resident Board&#13;
and thought that was an imposition.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes, I'm sure. I know Lew was. I suppose we have to hold our United States&#13;
shareholders accountable for it. I didn't serve here of course with Clausen, but I think Lew was&#13;
actually quite a good President. I think he has brought to the Bank a couple of relatively simple&#13;
common sense ideas that you should, as I said earlier on, try to do the best that you can for our&#13;
borrowers, and not just to give them the most money that you can. The distinction between&#13;
finance and development assistance, really. He obviously wanted to strengthen career&#13;
management within the Bank. As far as can see, it's something that's needed. More recently, I&#13;
think he's been quite alert in responding to the growing unease on the part of some major&#13;
shareholders, not least of course the United States, about the budgetary demands of the&#13;
institution. I think Lew was by nature a shy individual. It was not only the semi-parliamentary&#13;
procedures in the Board that surprised him and, Iâ&#128;&#159;m sure, frustrated him, but also his lacking&#13;
facility for interacting easily on a week-to-week basis with 24 individuals, 48 if you include the&#13;
Alternate Executive Directors. That was not something that came naturally to him. I think, from&#13;
my brief view of him, Barber Conable was much more attuned to that.&#13;
&#13;
Q: It was more like the U.S. Congress.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes. That's right. Now, I don't know how you would change that by trying to&#13;
change the Board. It would help in my view if the Board was smaller. Then at least you&#13;
wouldn't spend so much time at the Board table listening to statements. And I think it would&#13;
also help to create a greater sense of collegiality if you had a smaller board than we do at&#13;
present. But, to be honest, I think that is a pipe dream. The United States were heading in that&#13;
direction at the time of, was it IDA-10? I've forgotten, I think it was IDA-10. Oh, no, no. I beg&#13;
your pardon. It was the IFC general capital increase in '91 when they had written into the&#13;
resolution or some understanding that the structure and composition of the Board would be&#13;
reviewed. With the change of Administration in Washington they backed away from that and&#13;
it's now no longer on the agenda. And the only way in which you could reduce the size of the&#13;
Board of course would be to eliminate the sole country Executive Directorships, oblige the&#13;
&#13;

                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
United States, Germany, Japan, Russia, China and the others to have other countries in their&#13;
groups. They are not going to do that, so it is a pipe dream. Meanwhile every time, although I&#13;
think we've now reached the limit, but every time a new member joins the institution the&#13;
inevitable reaction is: â&#128;&#156;Let's expand the size of the Board.â&#128;? We did it for Russia, we did it for&#13;
Switzerland, did it for China.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Saudi Arabia?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Saudi Arabia is another example, yes. That was always the pattern. It's hard to&#13;
imagine weâ&#128;&#159;ll need another chair unless Cuba or North Korea become so weighty that they are&#13;
given one as well. But when you think that we now have almost 190 members and there are&#13;
only I think 16 Board members who represent more than one country, you have about 170&#13;
members spread across 16 directors. It's more than 10 countries per elected Board member,&#13;
although some of the one country constituencies also elect their representatives. But the idea of&#13;
reducing the Board without spreading the country representation to some extent I don't think&#13;
would be viable.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I understand that Mr. Wolfensohn is not shy, from what I've heard and might tackle issues&#13;
like that?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I don't know him very well. I had met him when I was a youngster traveling&#13;
from Canberra to annual meetings. At that time, the Australian Treasury would ordinarily visit&#13;
New York to talk to banks and we always had a meeting with Wolfensohn, which is a sign that&#13;
he is well connected. I sat in on one or two of those, but for sure neither he nor I drew any clear&#13;
impressions from those occasions. I did meet him of course with colleagues at the lunch he&#13;
kindly held for the Board about a month or two ago. He's no shrinking violet, I would say that.&#13;
And I think he will be a very different President from Lew.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In Australia is it customary in corporate settings to have resident boards?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: No.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So the corporate structure is similar to the United States?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes. You have a mixture of executive and non-executive directors on those&#13;
boards. Our Central Bank is a good example. It has a board comprised of the Governor, his&#13;
Deputy, the head of the Treasury, the National Treasury ex-officio, and then a series of business&#13;
people, academics, no private bankers, but, you know, representatives of the business&#13;
community.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Turning back to issues that face the Bank as opposed to the Board, how do you think the&#13;
Bank should address the needs of the new areas that are coming to the fore in the Eastern&#13;
European countries, the Baltic states, the former Soviet Union itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I think in much the same way as we treat all our needy members. Again, giving&#13;
them the best assistance we can to help them put in place market-based economic systems,&#13;
which is undoubtedly, at least in the case of these countries, much more important than the&#13;
amount we are going to lend them in any particular year.&#13;
&#13;
There is obviously, getting back to this difficult area we discussed before, a great need for&#13;
effective technical assistance to these countries because these countries are undergoing a&#13;
fundamental transformation. Russia is a classic case. It has had no experience with market&#13;
systems in its history. Yet, to establish such systems is the essential need.&#13;
&#13;
The major shareholders have not done the Bank or the recipient countries in the former Soviet&#13;
Union much of a service by pressing the Bank to lend more than the Bank should be lending. If&#13;
you take Russia, I think the Board has now approved probably 11 or 12 projects; as of late last&#13;
year about half had not even been effective. We are making many of these loans mainly to&#13;
signal to the rest of the world that we are being active to save this part of the world from&#13;
reverting to communism.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How do you think the Bank should provide more of this technical assistance without&#13;
overloading its agenda, especially in light of the fact that its resources, the Bank's own&#13;
resources are obviously limited?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Well, they are limited, but they are still substantial. And not all of this work of&#13;
course is done by Bank staff themselves. Bank money has to be used to pay for the services, but&#13;
there's great use of consultants with high expertise in these fields and one hopes it proves to be&#13;
more effective than it has been in some parts of Russia. We tend to think of the Bank as the&#13;
World Bank too often. Yet, IFC actually has done some good work in the former Soviet Union&#13;
the last three or four years so, not least in terms of helping to privatize. This of course is part of&#13;
the market reform process. In addition, IFC has also helped to strengthen and in many cases&#13;
create sound financial institutions which are obviously essential.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: So, I see the Bank Group already playing an active role in the transformation,&#13;
especially on the financial system development side. Of course, we should also bear in mind&#13;
that the Bank, notwithstanding its importance as a donor in this area, is only one part of a big&#13;
jigsaw of donors. It's the European Union who's a big player here and the U.K. has a significant&#13;
TA program, and the U.S. is probably doing quite a bit as well.&#13;
&#13;
I see a little bit of this, incidentally, because Mongolia is a member of my group. Mongolia was&#13;
not formally a Soviet republic, but in fact it was. Mongolia has had very valuable assistance&#13;
from both the IMF and the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
It's essentially of the conventional kind. We are trying to guide them in terms of the policy&#13;
reforms that they must undertake to get anywhere, and to provide them with some financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          John Cosgrove&#13;
                                     May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
assistance to replace assistance that used to come from the Soviet Union. Mongolia in 1991&#13;
basically saw its national income drop by about 25 percent because Russia was no longer in a&#13;
position to provide transfers of the kind and of the size it provided earlier. So Mongolia turned&#13;
to the Bank, the Asian Bank, the Japanese, the Americans who would step in with a mixture of&#13;
policy advice and financial assistance. Mongolia is now actually growing. Mongolia still has a&#13;
long way to go; they are not out of the woods by any means. But I think it faces fairly common&#13;
problems, with the major exception that the institution of marketplace reforms is even more&#13;
vital than it is in other parts of the world where there are some sorts of admittedly weak and&#13;
limited market operations.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How do you see the increasing demands on the Bank reconciled with the perception of the&#13;
Bank as too large and bloated? If the Bank is bloated don't you think part of the blame has to&#13;
rest with the shareholders as represented in the Board? There has never been an attempt on the&#13;
part of the Board to try to bring some focus into the activities of the organization. How do you&#13;
see this issue and how do you see this possibly getting resolved?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Well, first, I couldn't agree with you more, and I've been a bit of a squeaky&#13;
wheel in the Board on this very point. I've constantly argued against the Bank getting into areas&#13;
of activity which I believe do not lie within its comparative advantage.&#13;
&#13;
Let me give you one example that's topical at the moment, it is this [Ismail] Serageldin idea, not&#13;
necessarily his personal idea but he's handling it, for the Bank to get involved in micro-credit&#13;
type facilities. The Bank may not actually get into the business of lending to micro-credit&#13;
agencies but it would be fairly actively involved at the center of a new consultative group-type&#13;
arrangement in this area. I've opposed that and now I'm glad to say Canberra is not very happy&#13;
about it either, although it will probably contribute in the end because the problem with this&#13;
business I think, the problem with a lot of this business is that people find it very difficult to say&#13;
â&#128;&#156;No.â&#128;? If they say â&#128;&#156;No,â&#128;? they feel they are going to be tarred by somebody or other as a person&#13;
who doesn't care about the needs of the poor. And that's what's really a bit of a pity, but the&#13;
debate is as inadequate as that.&#13;
&#13;
I've also been questioning another recent example, the provision by the Bank of grant money to&#13;
United Nations agencies to help them finance their own operations. That is not what the Bank&#13;
was intended to do. The scale of recent humanitarian disaster is undoubted, and the need for&#13;
dramatic international assistance is clear, but it should not have come from the Bank. The only&#13;
reason why it comes from the Bank is because we have money and the United Nations doesn't.&#13;
The Bank is a wonderful money-making machine. It charges its borrowers a spread, it is able to&#13;
take free capital subscribed by the members and invest it in Wall Street and Tokyo and various&#13;
other places and there is a nice little pot of gold. The United Nations is not slow. It doesn't take&#13;
Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali very long to understand that thereâ&#128;&#159;s a $50 million bundle down&#13;
there at the World Bank that he can easily tap and get the U.N. name on the packages as they&#13;
are dropped from helicopters or however they do it. That's a real problem, and you are right, it&#13;
is a job for the Board, not for the management, to say: â&#128;&#156;This is not our job.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          John Cosgrove&#13;
                                     May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, there was a bit of an attempt made by management basically, but with the Board actively&#13;
involved, last year, to become more selective. It was one of the six principles that Lew&#13;
eventually put out under his own name. But I'm afraid the principles are so universal that almost&#13;
anything can be justified. So, in my view that attempt to define the Bank's area of expertise&#13;
wasn't successful. We need to do more about that.&#13;
&#13;
But I wouldn't hold high the prospects of bringing the Bank back from some of these various&#13;
directions in which it's headed, in recent years at least. I don't think the Bank's shareholders&#13;
want to do it. Maybe we should vote more often than we do in the Board. It is almost never&#13;
going to be the case that the representative of a recipient country group will say "No" to&#13;
something that is offered. As the Board operates by consensus you already have a kind of an&#13;
unstated majority in favor. When you include some of the Western European chairs where the&#13;
aid expenditure remains at a very high level together with the recipient country representatives,&#13;
there is a majority for everything. On the other hand, if you were to put things to a formal vote,&#13;
you would get some different decisions. The United States with still 18 percent is much more&#13;
likely to question some initiatives, and that tends to be more of the typical attitude of the Anglo-&#13;
Saxons as well. And there are some others. For example, the Italian chair in recent times has&#13;
been seriously questioning some of the things that the Bank has been doing, particularly things&#13;
like assistance to Rwanda and emergency credits to Haiti and that kind of stuff.&#13;
&#13;
So I think you need to use the Board as a decision-making mechanism to change the present&#13;
practice, which is essentially â&#128;&#156;Yes, we hear you all and we'll help you.â&#128;? I think the Bank does&#13;
itself a disservice in that way.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Speaking of some of the more recent areas of focus for the Bank, what is your assessment of&#13;
the Bank's achievements in dealing with environmental issues?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Much greater than it's given credit for. Surely there have been some bad&#13;
mistakes, and there again, Sardar Sarovar sticks out. We were looking at some project&#13;
completion reports on it, actually only last Friday, which reminded us again of how much was&#13;
meant to be done and what was not done in the project preparation period. It's rather interesting&#13;
to see that the things that were addressed properly, basically the engineering aspects of that&#13;
particular project, worked very nicely, and the ones that weren't attended to are the ones where&#13;
we've seen problems emerging.&#13;
&#13;
There is a real problem here for the Bank. It's a problem which to a fair extent is a rather silly&#13;
one. That is the idea that the construction of large hydroelectric generation projects is just&#13;
anathema to many people in the community at large. Politicians seem to find it very difficult to&#13;
say to these people: â&#128;&#156;We really disagree with you. This is a country with massive needs for&#13;
efficient energy supply. This is the most efficient way to do it. Yes, we are going to have to&#13;
flood some valleys that presently have trees in them, and yes, there will be some impact on the&#13;
fish population and maybe the butterflies. But we've got to weigh all this and in our judgment&#13;
no immutable harm to the structure of the planet is going to be done.â&#128;? But this is not the way it&#13;
works these days. This gets back a little, well, more than a little, to what I was commenting on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
before, about the role of Board members and the difficulties that I know Iâ&#128;&#159;ve had always when&#13;
dealing with environmental projects, at least with the Australians.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank's work for the most part is very constructive and helpful, not least in this area, and it&#13;
goes unnoticed. There have been a couple of occasions where Board members, typically the&#13;
United States chair, because the U.S. ED is under more pressure than any of the rest of us from&#13;
environmentalists, have helped to deal with the pressure. The American office has actually gone&#13;
to a lot of trouble, with the assistance of Bank staff and the recipient country in question, to&#13;
demonstrate as clearly as they can that the claimed problems of an environmental or human&#13;
kind associated with some of these projects are not problems, or at least not serious problems at&#13;
all. They have managed to disarm the opponents of Bank involvement in some of these&#13;
projects. That's a very time-consuming task there. The U.S. office may well be the only one that&#13;
can marshal the resources needed because we are here in their capital city to do it. But I think&#13;
it's a pity that so many other cases are going by the wayside, when I still believe that the Bank&#13;
can be a force for good even in an environmental project. I just happen to know the Three&#13;
Gorges project in China, a classic case, I don't know whether it's a good or a bad project, but if&#13;
the Bank were involved, the people outside the Bank who were concerned about that&#13;
development would have less ground for concern than if the Bank is not in. There have been&#13;
other projects where the Bank's involvement was precluded. One that's still a possibility, of&#13;
course, of going the same way is the Arun Dam, still a subject of discussions with the&#13;
inspection guys.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Do you think the inspection panel was a step forward?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Well, I'd have to say I was opposed to it, mainly because I thought it was likely&#13;
to blur the lines of responsibility within the Bank. It seemed to me that Bank management had&#13;
the basic responsibility to ensure that the projects the Bank is financing are designed and&#13;
implemented as well as possible. The Board has a responsibility to double-check that. I was&#13;
worried that if you set up an independent agency to check everything, both of those other&#13;
responsible bodies may rest on their laurels and say: â&#128;&#156;Oh, well, it's okay if we make a mistake,&#13;
you know, Mr. [Ernst G.] Broeder and his men will make sure that things will be fine.â&#128;? It didn't&#13;
have to be as black and white as that, but there was a risk of some lessening of what I saw as an&#13;
appropriate sense of responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
I went along with it in the end because it was clear that the Board was virtually unanimous in&#13;
wanting it to come into existence. Of course, I had always been conscious of the public&#13;
relations benefit that this thing would probably produce. It's too early to tell how it's going to&#13;
work out. I think the first effort on the Arun Dam wasn't a terribly encouraging one, to be&#13;
honest, but it's not easy to do things perfectly the first time you try, and I suppose you have to&#13;
be reasonably understanding of the difficulties that the panel faced with that case. But creating a&#13;
new committee to deal with a problem that you should be able to deal with anyway remains a&#13;
questionable way to proceed.&#13;
&#13;
Q: On another issue, the issue of women in development, what's your assessment of how that's&#13;
working?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         John Cosgrove&#13;
                                    May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: I think it's come much more into the mainstream of the Bank's work. I'm sure&#13;
it's still not truly mainstream. I'm a little bit of a reactionary on this, and I tend to think more of&#13;
the importance of people in development than women in development. But I do acknowledge&#13;
that in a number of member countries women seem to get the rough end of the deal, and they&#13;
may well need some special assistance to allow them to exploit their own capacities.&#13;
&#13;
We've got to a point in the Bank now where we've put in place some very sensible guiding&#13;
principles. As with so much of recent policy developments in the Bank, the key question is how&#13;
quickly is it actually being put into place in terms of Bank operations. It's not easy for me to&#13;
judge that, to be honest. We only get these overview annual accounts through things like the&#13;
Annual Review of Portfolio Performance and more specific reviews of particular policies like&#13;
the Gender in Development, I think it's now called, which summarize progress. I think the focus&#13;
on women is a pretty important development notwithstanding my view about the important role&#13;
that men have to play as well. But we've still got a fair way to go I'm sure in terms of&#13;
persuading our members to recognize the need to address women's needs. Again, it comes back&#13;
to some extent again to this policy reform agenda of the Bank. In countries where women are&#13;
not allowed to participate in certain areas of activity I think the Bank should be drawing on its&#13;
global development experience to work with the governments of those countries and say:&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Well, look, this is what you are missing, you know. Here's a country that does use its female&#13;
population as effectively as it can. Look at what they are doing, and look at what you have&#13;
done.â&#128;? It's not easy, that type of work. But I do believe it's an area where the Bank can often do&#13;
most.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Finally, to turn back just for a moment to perhaps a few more words on Preston. You&#13;
assessed him well in terms of bringing focus and professionalism to the Bank. But the Bank has&#13;
also come under fire increasingly as bureaucratic and bloated. What about this issue? It is in&#13;
many ways a highly politicized issue, this notion of the bloated bureaucracy. How would you&#13;
assess, for one, the significance of the issue itself, and then, secondly, how Preston has dealt&#13;
with it?&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Well, I do think it's a serious issue. I came to the Bank with that view and I&#13;
haven't seen anything here that leads me to change it. The simplest way in which I've thought&#13;
about the issue is that if you count the total number of World Bank Group staff, including long-&#13;
term consultants, but not the short-term consultants, and divide that number by the Bank's&#13;
membership, at least the last time I did it, you end up with something in excess of 50 staff&#13;
members per member. I can't imagine why any institution needs so many people to service a&#13;
member, particularly when I think of the members that I represent. And Australia gets a certain&#13;
amount of treatment from the World Bank Group because we are still a relatively significant&#13;
financier of the Bank. New Zealand, I would say, gets close to none, except that the&#13;
Bank is aware of what New Zealand has done on the policy reform front since 1984, and from&#13;
time to time invites an expert from New Zealand to come and explain to the Bank how it was&#13;
done, and what the benefits have been and so on.&#13;
Korea, of course, has had a very active recent relationship with the Bank. They are now no&#13;
longer eligible to borrow but I'm sure there have been a significant number of Bank staff&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  27&#13;

&#13;
members working with Korea. Mongolia also has had some very active assistance since it&#13;
joined the Bank in 1991, although, again, I would find it hard to imagine that they are&#13;
consuming 50 staff years each year. For the rest, 10 staff years at the most. So where is all this&#13;
going? I'm sure it's going to India and China and Sub-Saharan Africa, and increasingly the&#13;
former Soviet Union. Of course, I'm aware of the fact that many of the donors, not the least the&#13;
United States, make very considerable demands on the Bank. But still, 50 people working for&#13;
each member country per year strikes me as too many.&#13;
&#13;
Beyond that, I think that if I were a middle-to-lower level professional in the Bank, a higher-&#13;
level staff member, but below Level 26 or 25, I think, Iâ&#128;&#159;d be pretty frustrated. Everything that I&#13;
can see in this place happens at the top. If you are going to do a new project or a series of&#13;
projects in Russia, Wilfried Thalwitz will talk to Russiaâ&#128;&#159;s Governor and they will work out a set&#13;
of priorities for the next couple of years. Then the people down the line are set in motion to dot&#13;
the "Iâ&#128;&#159;s" and cross the "Tâ&#128;&#159;s" and get it all done.&#13;
&#13;
I think if you had a smaller institution with more devolution of responsibility, you would have a&#13;
more satisfied staff. Itâ&#128;&#159;s said at the moment that staff morale is low and I believe it probably is.&#13;
But the reasons why itâ&#128;&#159;s low, Iâ&#128;&#159;m not sure have been accurately analyzed. One hears a lot about&#13;
remuneration being less than it should be. Coming from Australia, which I know is no longer&#13;
one of the richest countries in the world, I find that idea utterly fanciful, even when I hear it&#13;
from Japanese and Western European people. To give you just one example thatâ&#128;&#159;s on my mind&#13;
right now because Iâ&#128;&#159;m getting ready to leave the Bank and I have to think about how I want to&#13;
use my Bank pension. On the basis of my contributions and the Bank's contributions to my&#13;
Bank pension over the space of four years it seems to me, I may be wrong about this because I&#13;
need to brush up on what I'm entitled to at home, from the Australia Government, but it seems&#13;
to me that my Bank pension for four years' contributions will be of the same order as my&#13;
Australian pension, which would have been based on about 30 years' contributions. It may be&#13;
the Bank's pension fund investors are extremely skillful, but I think essentially it reflects the&#13;
fact that remuneration is overgenerous. The remuneration doesn't seem to me to be the problem.&#13;
To the extent that we can't get people from Japan or Italy or the people who are already here&#13;
thinking of going home, I think it has more to do with non-financial aspects like a set-back to&#13;
your career, which happens. That is an issue, certainly when you go back home at some stage,&#13;
when you come from abroad. I know that's a very important consideration for the Japanese&#13;
where career pathing is highly structured and planned meticulously. In the case of the&#13;
Europeans I think it has more to do with spouse employment problems in the United States, and&#13;
the significant change of lifestyle as compared with living in Western Europe.&#13;
&#13;
The other reason for poor morale is the reduction in the size of the Bank now under way. I do&#13;
think this probably should have been handled a bit better. I've heard from many staff that the&#13;
rationale for it was not made clear. If that was the case then I think it was unfair on the part of&#13;
management and perhaps the Board, although, of course, you know, the idea was essentially a&#13;
management idea. I don't think it would have been too difficult to set out for staff a series of&#13;
three or four reasons why the Bank is now, if it hasn't been in the past, under a lot of external&#13;
scrutiny and that we need to show that we are conscious of that. Such a message would also&#13;
need to try to identify ways in which resources can be saved. Iâ&#128;&#159;ve said this in the Board, and I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                     May 3, 1995 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
know we've had discussion of the matter, but I was a little disappointed to see less coming in&#13;
the way of savings from higher productivity per employee than from a lower number of&#13;
employees. I see this most clearly in terms of the way economic analysis is handled in the&#13;
Bank. Economic reports are treated as though you are trying to write your only economic&#13;
treatise of your whole career. It will go through about five or six drafts. It will be commented&#13;
on by six or 10 or 12 people. That's just unnecessary, you just have to expect people to be&#13;
accountable for fairly speedy work. I think of my earlier experience in national government. I&#13;
would come in the morning to my desk in Canberra and I would have the Minister's office on&#13;
the phone saying: â&#128;&#156;Oh, the Minister has got to talk to so and so. He's got to go to a Cabinet&#13;
meeting that hadn't originally been scheduled. He needs a briefing material on this or that.â&#128;?&#13;
That has to be done in two hours, and it's for a national decision-making purpose. Here the&#13;
Bank will spend months, six months, writing an economic report on a country for the sake of&#13;
having one every year.&#13;
&#13;
I saw a regional economic report on the South Pacific countries that I represent prepared by the&#13;
Bank a few months ago for a regular meeting in the South Pacific. It was quite a nice piece of&#13;
work. It had taken a long time with many staff visits to the countries concerned to make sure&#13;
that we knew what was going on. What staggered me was when I saw a related piece of paper&#13;
that told me how much money had been spent on this, U.S. $600,000. I've said to them, I'll do it&#13;
for you if you give me $300,000. It's that kind of thing that has to change, and I think the Bank&#13;
would benefit from that.&#13;
&#13;
I also believe, if I can refer to another thing in our conversation, the one you raised, Jochen,&#13;
about the shareholders asking the Bank to do this, that and everything else. In my experience,&#13;
the only way in which you can truly be forced to think about your priorities is when you have a&#13;
smaller number of chips to play with. So long as you are in an amply resourced situation, you'll&#13;
do as much as anyone asks you to do. When you are suddenly faced with 10 or 15 percent less,&#13;
then you go and think. We went through this in Canberra. We had a kind of Rolls-Royce&#13;
approach to our work of the kind that the Bank has had, quality controls, extremely strict at the&#13;
highest level, nothing would go out of the Department unless it was rated by somebody like a&#13;
Director level here in the Bank, if not a Vice President level. We just realized 10 or 15 years&#13;
ago that we couldn't keep going on that way. The taxpayers wouldn't put up with it, and we&#13;
didn't need to go that way, anyway. We needed to give more responsibility to the people whom&#13;
we had hired and believed capable and let them carry the can if something was done&#13;
inadequately.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Of course the various trust funds and consultant funds and so on have further diluted cost&#13;
consciousness and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Right. I agree.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Oftentimes you find yourself as a manager in a position where your subordinates tell you: II&#13;
Well, you are not going to tell me that I can't do this because I got the money from Japan or&#13;
from Holland and so on and so forth. You know, these are the people that I have to satisfy now.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
COSGROVE: Yes. That's a problem. There are still I think about 700 or 800 of them and it's&#13;
hard to manage them. There are, of course, some initiatives underway to try to rationalize the&#13;
system, which I'm on the whole in favor of. The driving force must be coming from the&#13;
shareholders themselves, some of whom are being critical of the Bank's core structure as a&#13;
result. There's certainly a lack of consistency there. I've tried to be as consistent in my approach&#13;
as I can, which as I say, sometimes put me at odds with my major shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, thank you very much, John; that was an excellent interview.&#13;

            In May 1995, John H. Cosgrove was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Jochen Kraske and William Becker. During
            his World Bank tenure from 1991 to 1995, Mr. Cosgrove served
            as executive director representing the Western Pacific
            states. Cosgrove discusses his objectives and
            accomplishments as executive director. His transcript
            concerns his relationship with the board and its members,
            the progress of the World Bank on the issue of women in
            development, and its handling of staff reductions. He
            concludes his discussion by stressing the crucial role of
            shareholders in affecting change in terms of cost
            consciousness and accountability in the World Bank.
