6.    In the event any amounts are to be returned to the Donor under this Administration Agreement,&#13;
the Bank shall transfer such amounts to the Donor unless otherwise agreed with the Bank.&#13;
7.1.   The Interpretative Addendum and all Annexes hereto, as well as the Framework Agreement&#13;
between the World Bank Group and the European Commission, constitute the entire agreement and&#13;
understanding between the Donor and the Bank. In the event of any inconsistency, the Framework&#13;
Agreement prevails over the Administration Agreement and the Administration Agreement (including its&#13;
Interpretative Addendum) prevails over its Annexes. Unless otherwise specified in an annex hereto, this&#13;
Administration Agreement may be amended only by written amendment between the Bank and the&#13;
Donor; provided, however, that any annexes to this Administration Agreement may be amended only by&#13;
written amendment of all donors contributing to the Trust Fund.&#13;
7.2.   Annex 2 of this Administration Agreement, reflecting non-substantive differences with the&#13;
analogous Annex in the model Administration Agreement attached to the 2014 Framework&#13;
Agreement, applies to all donors to this Trust Fund because the Trust Fund is ajoint multi-donor&#13;
initiative. Nevertheless, this Administration Agreement is concluded in the context of the 2014&#13;
Framework Agreement and, if paragraph 9.5 (ii) below applies, or for purposes of paragraph 9.5 (iii)&#13;
below when applicable, this Administration Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with&#13;
the terms of the 2014 Framework Agreement, in particular sections 4.2, 4.3 and 7.1 of the Annex 2 to&#13;
Attachment I to the 2014 Framework Agreement.&#13;
7.3    Notwithstanding paragraph 12 of Annex 2 to this Administration Agreement, the End&#13;
Disbursement date for purposes of the Contribution is 19 December 2019.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿8.    Individual procurement and grant contracts under this Administration Agreement shall be signed&#13;
by the World Bank Group entity no later than forty-seven (47) months from the date of this&#13;
Administration Agreement.&#13;
9.1.   The following derogations from the Framework Agreement shall apply in cases of crisis,&#13;
emergency and post-emergency situations:&#13;
9.2.   Article 2.6 of the 2014 Framework Agreement specifies that, "in duly justified cases of crisis and&#13;
emergency and post-recovery situations," derogations from the terms of the 2014 Framework Agreement&#13;
may be made. Given that this Administration Agreement aims at supporting activities for the benefit of&#13;
Afghanistan, and given that Afghanistan, in the opinion of the Parties, represents such a case where such&#13;
derogations are justified, the Parties hereby agree to derogate from the 2014 Framework Agreement for&#13;
the reasons and in the manner as follow:&#13;
9.3.   Through its Article 14.1.4, the 2014 Framework Agreement sets forth a notional approach for&#13;
determining compliance with cost eligibility requirements in the case of a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF),&#13;
such as this TF050576.&#13;
9.4.   However, said Article 14.1.4's application of the notional approach solely to cost eligibility&#13;
requirements does not expressly cover the situation where the European Commission contributes to a&#13;
commingled account amounts governed by the terms of the Framework Agreement, co-signed on March&#13;
20, 2009 between the European Commission and the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development, the International Development Association, and the International Finance Corporation (the&#13;
"2009 Framework Agreement"), and amounts governed by the terms of the 2014 Framework Agreement.&#13;
Consequently, the Parties hereby derogate from said Article's provisions by explicitly expanding them to&#13;
cover situations where successive European Commission contributions are governed by the 2009&#13;
Framework Agreement or the 2014 Framework Agreement.&#13;
9.5.   Consequently, pursuant to the notional approach, any use by the World iank Group of amounts&#13;
contributed by the European Commission shall be deemed compliant with the terms of either the 2009&#13;
Framework Agreement or the 2014 Framework Agreements as follows:&#13;
(i)    if an activity was fully funded by resources from this TF050576 before any EC contributions&#13;
under this Administration Agreement are received by the Bank, then such activity falls under the terms of&#13;
the 2009 Framework Agreement;&#13;
(ii)  if an activity begins to be funded by resources from this TF050576 after an amount equivalent to&#13;
all contributions covered by prior Administration Agreements entered into by the European Commission&#13;
with regard to this TF050576 has been disbursed by the Bank, and the relevant Grant Agreement for such&#13;
activity was signed after the date of this Administration Agreement, then such activity falls under the&#13;
terms of the 2014 Framework Agreement.&#13;
(iii)  if an activity begins to be funded by resources from this TF050576 before an amount equivalent&#13;
to all contributions covered by prior Administration Agreements entered into by the European&#13;
Commission with regard to this TF050576 has been disbursed by the Bank, and the relevant Grant&#13;
Agreement for such activity was signed after the date of this Administration Agreement, then such&#13;
activity falls under the terms of either one of those Framework Agreements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿10.     The measures taken to identify the EU as a source of financing shall be in accordance with&#13;
Attachment 4 of the Framework Agreement.&#13;
11.     Each of the Parties represents, by confirming its agreement below, that it is authorized to enter&#13;
into this Administration Agreement and act in accordance with these terms and conditions. The Parties are&#13;
requested to sign and date this Administration Agreement, and upon possession by the Bank of this fully&#13;
signed Administration Agreement, this Administration Agreement shall become effective as of the date of&#13;
the last signature&#13;

ï»¿Interpretative Addendum&#13;
For purposes of interpreting Art. 14.1.4 of the 2014 Framework Agreement (and not as a derogation from&#13;
such Article), the "notional approach" referred to therein shall apply in the following manner in cases of&#13;
both Direct and Indirect Management modalities:&#13;
a)  This Trust Fund is a "Multi Donor Trust Fund" or "MDTF," defined as follows in Article 1(v) of&#13;
the 2014 Framework Agreement: "a trust fund that may receive contributions from more than&#13;
one donor, whose funds are pooled under a single set of agreed terms and such funds are not&#13;
earmarked by individual donors for specific categories of expenditures, also known as 'joint co-&#13;
financing' by the Commission." Consequently, the contributions from the Commission, as well&#13;
as from other donors ("Other Contributions"), form an account of commingled funds (the "MDTF&#13;
Pool") within which no one particular donor's contribution can be traced.&#13;
b) In administering the MDTF Pool, the Bank applies terms that are the same for all contributions to&#13;
the MDTF, in addition to terms, derived from the 2014 Framework Agreement, that apply solely to&#13;
the Commission Contribution ("Commission Terms"). Examples of Commission Terms include&#13;
(i) that costs are incurred within a specified time period (2014 Framework Agreement Arts.&#13;
14.1.1(c) and 14.2.1(b)), (ii) that costs are verifiable through supporting documents retained for&#13;
7-years after the applicable End Disbursement Date (2014 Framework Agreement Arts. 14.1.1(e),&#13;
14.2.1(d) and 17.4), or (iii) that the Trust Fund pay for indirect costs only at levels not exceeding&#13;
those accepted by the Commission pursuant to 2014 Framework Agreement Art. 13.4.&#13;
c) The notional approach allows the Commission to participate in MDTFs where not all expenditures&#13;
would be eligible for the Commission (see point b immediately above) without earmarking its&#13;
contribution to specific items or on the basis of geographical criteria. It allows so by verifying that&#13;
there is enough expenditure in the MDTF eligible in accordance with the Commission Terms to&#13;
justify the Commission contribution.&#13;
d) Consequently, if, in carrying out verifications or audits of the Trust Fund under 2014 Framework&#13;
Agreement Art. 17.2, a sampling by a European Union competent body finds ineligible&#13;
expenditures because of non-compliance solely with Commission Terms, no refunds need be made&#13;
by the Bank or any Recipients, nor shall adjustments be made under 2014 Framework Agreement&#13;
Art. 15.3.1, nor shall any offsets be applied under 2014 Framework Agreement Art. 16.5 or&#13;
otherwise, as long as sufficient Other Contributions to cover the amount of such expenditures were&#13;
made to the MDTF Pool before the End Disbursement Date. Such refunds, adjustments or offsets&#13;
may only be applied (i) if, and to the extent, the ineligible expenditures are in excess of Other&#13;
Contributions and (ii) if the Bank does not provide documentation to justify that an amount equal&#13;
to such ineligible expenditures is covered by the Other Contributions.&#13;
The provisions of this paragraph shall be applied in conjunction and are consistent with Art. 17 of, and&#13;
Attachment 3 to, the 2014 Framework Agreement, and are also consistent with the terms of Art. 42.2 of&#13;
the Rules of Application (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012).&#13;

Farmers, and especially female farmers, are supported in the identification and addressing of&#13;
their farming- and nutrition- related needs through the establishment of Farmers Resource and Learning&#13;
Centres (FLRCs), in coordination with the NSP Community Development Council model.&#13;
Develop and approve the concept, scope, functions and financing and safeguard arrangements for&#13;
FRLCs, including defining the approach to Participatory Community Empowerment (PCE). Creation of&#13;
parallel structures will be avoided. The FRLCs will be an expression of the CDCs and NSP extension&#13;
workers will have a pivotal role in the setting up of the FRLCs.&#13;
Employing PCE, support the formulation of bottom-up investment packages which aim at&#13;
ensuring food security, increasing farmers' income, promoting production and consumption of diversified&#13;
nutrient rich foods and which integrate (i) Farmers Resource and Learning Centres (ii) extension leaming&#13;
and support packages (iii) and enterprise and market development activities within an integrated farming&#13;
systems approach.&#13;
Strengthen the role of women in agricultural production and service delivery, also by developing&#13;
special extension programs, establishing a joint programme for capacity building and training for women&#13;
extension workers, including training on nutrition topics.&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿Following Steering Committee approval of Farm investment packages, CDCs set up (approx.&#13;
1000) FRLCs in selected areas where subsistence and commercial farmers will benefit from service&#13;
providers and inputs; target areas will be selected by the Steering Committee.&#13;
Identify, demonstrate and replicate improved inputs service delivery arrangements, strengthen the&#13;
role that FRLCs play in extension outreach, and improving communication flows and messages.&#13;

the Steering Committee a report which will describe in detail the operations of the Trust&#13;
Fund, including the receipt and use of donor contributions to the Trust Fund and the&#13;
activities financed therefrom, together with minutes of the monthly meetings of the&#13;
Management Committee. The Management Committee will act collectively and, to the&#13;

6.     Implementation of Activities under the Trust Fund&#13;
(a)    The Administration will be responsible for implementing the activities to be financed&#13;
under Categories (1) and (2). Implementation of the activities to be financed under Category (3) is&#13;
governed by the provisions of paragraph 9 of this Annex. The Bank will engage one or more Monitoring&#13;
Agents to monitor expenditures related to the activities financed under Categories (1), (2) and (3). Each&#13;
Monitoring Agent will be selected and retained by the Bank on the basis of terms of reference/scope of&#13;
work agreed by the Management Committee and the Bank. The responsibilities of each Monitoring Agent&#13;
will include monitoring the procurement of goods, services and other items, screening and recommending&#13;
withdrawal applications for the Bank's approval and payment, monitoring all expenditures financed by&#13;
the Grant Funds and pre-screening the financial management capacity of potential Sub-grant Recipients&#13;
so as to ensure that Grant Funds are disbursed only for the purposes specified in paragraph 4 of this&#13;
Annex and according to applicable Bank procedures.&#13;
(b)    Monitoring Agents will report to the Bank. Subject to the approval of the Management&#13;
Committee, the Bank will have the authority to change the terms of reference/scope of work of each&#13;
Monitoring Agent and, where justified, to replace each Monitoring Agent with another firm or agency.&#13;
The Bank will give advance notice to the Administration, the Management Committee and the Donors of&#13;
changes to the terms of reference/scope of work of each Monitoring Agent. The Bank will perform ex-&#13;
post evaluations of the activities undertaken by the Monitoring Agents, and will, upon completion of the&#13;
activities financed under the Trust Fund, arrange for an independent review of the performance of the&#13;
Monitoring Agents and report its findings to the Donors.&#13;
(c)    The Grant Funds may be used by the Bank to: (i) pay the reasonable fees, travel and other&#13;
reimbursable costs of Monitoring Agents; and (ii) pay the cost of goods, services and other items of&#13;
expenditure in furtherance of the Trust Fund activities, all in accordance with the provisions of the Grant,&#13;

IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" and the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency".&#13;
7.     The Bank's Use of Grant Funds and Administrative Cost Recovery&#13;
(a)    The Grant Funds will be accounted for as part of a single Trust Fund which will be kept&#13;
separate and apart from other funds of the Bank. Donor contributions to the Trust Fund may not be&#13;
earmarked for one or more specific Categories and will instead be allocated among all Categories in&#13;
accordance with the decisions of the Management Committee. A Donor may state a preference that its&#13;
contribution be used to finance one or more Categories, or certain activities in a given sector, with the&#13;
understanding that neither the Management Committee nor the Bank will be in a position to guarantee&#13;
that total spending with respect to any given Category or sector will match or exceed the level of the&#13;
contribution in connection with which a preference will have been stated. Undesignated contributions will&#13;
be allocated among Categories in accordance with the decisions of the Management Committee. No&#13;
contribution to the Trust Fund will be accepted unless it equals or exceeds two hundred thousand United&#13;
States dollars (US$200,000).&#13;
(b)    The Bank may invest the Grant Funds pending their disbursement in any instrument in&#13;
which the Bank is authorized to invest its own funds. The investment income earned on the Grant Funds&#13;
pending disbursement will be added to the account to be used for purposes of the Trust Fund.&#13;
(c)    In order to assist in the defrayment of its administrative costs, the Bank may upon receipt&#13;
of the Grant Funds, deduct from the T-Account and transfer to itself:&#13;
(i)    as of January 1, 2016, an amount equivalent to three percent (3.0%) of the amount of the&#13;
Grant Funds (other than for ad hoc payments);&#13;
(ii)   as of January 1, 2017, an amount equivalent to four percent (4.0%) of the amount of the&#13;
Grant Funds (other than for ad hoc payments); and&#13;
(iii)  an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the amount of the Grant Funds allocated to the&#13;
Recurrent and Capital Expenditures Category for the purposes of ad hoc payments.&#13;
The Bank may also deduct from the T-Account and transfer to itself the actual costs of the Bank's&#13;
contract with the Monitoring Agent(s), as well as the cost of the independent review of the Monitoring&#13;
Agent(s)'s performance referred to under paragraph 6(b) of this Annex.&#13;
8.     Fiduciary Responsibilities of the Bank&#13;
(a)    The Bank will be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in&#13;
this Letter Agreement, including this Annex, and will not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities&#13;
to Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Letter Agreement&#13;
will be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement&#13;
or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved. The Bank will have no responsibility to Donors&#13;
with respect to the performance of the Monitoring Agent(s) and will have no obligation to reimburse the&#13;
Trust Fund or provide any compensation to any Donor if the Grant Funds are not disbursed for the&#13;
purposes specified in this Annex as a result of actions of the Monitoring Agent(s).&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(b)    Unless otherwise provided in this Letter Agreement, the Bank will apply its normal&#13;
financial management procedures to the Trust Fund. Such procedures applicable to the operation of the&#13;
Trust Fund will be communicated to the Donors without delay.&#13;
(c)    Unless otherwise provided in this Letter Agreement, the Bank will apply to the Trust&#13;
Fund its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent&#13;
the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to&#13;
the relevant decisions of the Security Council, taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donor acknowledges that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under&#13;
the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual&#13;
member country that may apply to the Donor, nor will it be deemed a waiver, express or implied, of any&#13;
of the privileges and immunities of the Bank.&#13;
9.     Terms and Conditions Governing Sub-Grants Under Cate2ory (3)&#13;
In the event that the Bank deems it necessary execute a sub-grant to carry out an Investment and&#13;
Program Activity eligible for financing under Category (3), the following provisions will apply:&#13;
(a)    The Bank will conclude a Sub-grant Agreement with each "Sub-grant Recipient".&#13;
(b)    Except as provided in paragraph (c) below, responsibility for the accounting and&#13;
administration of Grant Funds made available by the Bank to Sub-grant Recipients will be decided upon&#13;
on a case-by-case basis by the Management Committee, considering, inter alia, the recommendations&#13;
made by the Monitoring Agent(s). Accordingly, the Management Committee will review proposals to&#13;
carry out activities eligible for financing under Category (3) and award Sub-grants in connection with&#13;
proposals deemed by the Management Committee to be suitable for financing and consistent with the&#13;
Financing Strategy. Proposals for financing under Category (3) will be submitted for approval to the&#13;
Administration which, when approved, will forward them to the Management Committee for&#13;
consideration. Only proposals vetted by the Administration in the manner described in this sub-paragraph&#13;
will be considered by the Management Committee. A proposal submitted to the Management Committee,&#13;
through the Administration, will include an appraisal of the Investment and Program Activity sought to be&#13;
financed. For those proposals that do not include an appraisal of the Investment Project sought to be&#13;
financed, the Bank will carry out the appraisal of the Investment Project. The representative of a member&#13;
organization of the Management Committee will recuse him or herself from deliberations over the&#13;
suitability of proposal(s) submitted or co-financed by the organization that he or she represents.&#13;
(c)    Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph 9, proposals to&#13;
carry out a Law and Order Project may only be made and carried out by the United Nations Development&#13;
Programme. The latter will be the sole organization authorized to carry out Law and Order Projects&#13;
financed hereunder. Sub-grants to finance Law and Order Projects will be made in accordance with terms&#13;
and conditions acceptable to the Bank including, without limitation, those set forth in sub-paragraphs (a),&#13;
(d), (e), (f) and (g) of this paragraph 9 whose provisions shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any Sub-grant&#13;
made or to be made by the Bank to the United Nations Development Programme for purposes of carrying&#13;
out a Law and Order Project. UNDP, the Bank and the Management Committee will agree on detailed&#13;
procedures including procurement, disbursements and audits for processing Law and Order Projects.&#13;
(d)    Sub-grants will be used to finance expenditures for goods, works and services, as the case&#13;
may be, in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"&#13;
and the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency", as in effect at the date of the relevant Sub-grant agreement (hereinafter collectively&#13;
- 15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿referred to as the "Bank's Guidelines"). Any departure from the Bank's Guidelines will have to be&#13;
preapproved by the Bank.&#13;
(e)    The fiduciary arrangements for an Investment and Program Activity to be financed under&#13;
Category (3) will be carried out in accordance with the guidelines and procedures specified in paragraph&#13;
8(b) including but not limited to an environmental and social screening and assessment framework&#13;
approved by the Bank. Any departure from the guidelines contained in said framework will have to be&#13;
pre-approved by the Bank.&#13;
(f)    As required under regular Bank lending operations, a Sub-grant Agreement will obligate&#13;
a Sub-grant Recipient, among other things, to maintain an appropriate and adequate financial&#13;
management system, including records and accounts, and prepare financial statements adequate to&#13;
separately reflect the operations, resources and expenditures related to the Investment and Program&#13;
Activity financed under the Sub-grant. Within ninety (90) days of each June 30 and December 31, the&#13;
Sub-grant Recipient will prepare unaudited financial statements with respect to such Sub-grant and&#13;
forward a copy to the Bank. All financial statements appropriate to the size and purpose of the Sub-grant,&#13;
as indicated in the Sub-grant agreement will be expressed in the currency in which the Sub-grant is made,&#13;
as indicated in the Sub-grant Agreement, and will show the allocation of such funds among the activities&#13;
financed by the Sub-grant. In addition, the Sub-grant Recipient will: (i) have the above-mentioned&#13;
records, accounts and financial statements audited, in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to&#13;
the Bank, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) furnish to the Bank, as soon as available,&#13;
but in any case not later than six (6) months after the end of each calendar year: (A) certified copies of the&#13;
financial statements referred to above for such year as so audited, and (B) an opinion on such statements,&#13;
records and accounts and report of such audit, by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the&#13;
Bank will have reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the Bank such other information concerning said&#13;
records and accounts, and the audit thereof, as the Bank will from time to time reasonably request. In such&#13;
cases where the Sub-grant is 5 US$100,000 the Bank has the discretion to specify in the Sub-grant&#13;
agreement that attestation from the Monitoring Agent will be sufficient to comply with the audit&#13;
procedures above.&#13;
(g)    The Bank will report quarterly to the Donors on the status of Grant Funds made available&#13;
to a Sub-grant Recipient under a Sub-grant Agreement. In addition, at a Donor's request, the Bank will&#13;
also make available, in accordance with its Policy on Access to Information, audited and unaudited&#13;
financial statements of Sub-grant Recipients furnished under paragraph (f) above.&#13;
10.    Accountin2 and Financial Reporting Responsibilities of the Bank&#13;

Bank will prepare unaudited financial statements in United States dollars with respect to the Grant Funds&#13;
and forward a copy to each Donor. The Bank will provide the Donors annually with a management&#13;
assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors on the satisfactory performance of&#13;
the procedures and controls used by the Bank in administering the Grant Funds.&#13;
(b)    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such&#13;
an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange&#13;
- 16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect&#13;
to such audit, shall be paid by the requesting Donor.&#13;
11.    Progress Reporting Responsibilities of the Bank&#13;
(a)    The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the Donors. The Bank&#13;
will provide each Donor with quarterly reports on its quarterly expost evaluation of the activities&#13;
undertaken by the Monitoring Agent(s) including disbursements made out of the Grant Funds. Within (6)&#13;
six months of the completion of the activities, or of full disbursement of the Grant Funds, whichever&#13;
comes later, the Bank will provide a final progress report to each Donor, together with a copy of the&#13;
independent review of the performance of the Monitoring Agent(s). Upon request by any Donor, the Bank&#13;
will send to such Donor the draft and final reports received by the Bank from each Monitoring Agent on&#13;
the activities financed by the Grant Funds.&#13;
(b)    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund. The Donor and&#13;
the Bank shall agree on the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation and the Bank shall provide all&#13;
relevant information within the limits of its policies and procedures. All associated costs shall be borne by&#13;
the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance&#13;
or other audit of the Trust Fund and will be separate from any independent evaluation of the Trust Fund to&#13;
be arranged by the Bank.&#13;
12.    Termination&#13;
Unless otherwise agreed by the Donors and the Bank, the Trust Fund arrangement provided for&#13;
under the Letter Agreement and this Annex will expire on December 31, 2025. If at any time, either party&#13;
determines that the purposes of the Letter Agreement and this Annex can no longer be effectively or&#13;
appropriately carried out, this Letter Agreement may be terminated at the initiative of either party by&#13;
giving the other party thirty (30) days prior notice to this affect. Upon termination, unless otherwise&#13;
agreed by the Donors and the Bank: (i) any agreement entered into among the Bank, the Monitoring&#13;
Agent(s), and/or other third parties will not be affected by the termination, and the Bank will be entitled to&#13;
continue permitting withdrawals of Grant Funds in respect of such agreements as if this arrangement had&#13;
not been so terminated; and (ii) any remaining Grant Funds will be returned to the Donors on a pro-rata&#13;
basis, and the Bank's functions pursuant hereto will be considered terminated. Within six (6) months&#13;

13.    Le2al Documentation&#13;
For purposes of channeling Grant Funds to their intended beneficiaries in accordance with the&#13;
terms and conditions of the Letter Agreement and this Annex, the Bank will enter into a grant agreement&#13;
with the Administration concerning Trust Funds allocated to Categories (1) and (2). Grant Funds&#13;
allocated to Category (3) will be governed by separate sub-grant agreements to be entered into between&#13;
the Bank, on the one part, and sub-grant Recipients, on the other part, with each such agreement relating&#13;
to one or more Investment and Program Activity. Without prejudice to the foregoing, Grant Funds&#13;
allocated to Category (3) for the specific purpose of financing Law and Order Projects will be governed&#13;
by one or more grant agreements, as the case may be, to be entered into between the Bank, on the one&#13;
part, and the United Nations Development Programme, on the other part.&#13;
