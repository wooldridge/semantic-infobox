I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A.   Macroeconomic Setting&#13;
1.1   Azerbaijan is one of the oldest petroleum producing regions in the world. The country is also&#13;
well-endowed with various natural resources, including fertile agricultural land, a diversified&#13;
industrial structure, and a well-educated work force. However, in addition to the problems it shares&#13;
with other Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries, its transition to a market economy has been&#13;
complicated by regional conflicts. The war with Armenia, which began in 1989, has led to nearly&#13;
20 percent of the national territory being under the control of occupation forces, and about 900,000&#13;
people (out of a total population of 7.5 million) are refugees or internally displaced persons. While&#13;
a cease-fire has been in place since mid-1994, the conflict has been costly in terms of defense&#13;
spending, the social and economic costs of occupation, and difficulties in accessing economic&#13;
assistance.&#13;
1.2    Unprecedented shocks to the economy, stemming from the conflict with Armenia and its&#13;
ensuing refugee problems and from the dislocation of trade links among the FSU countries, have&#13;
resulted in a continuous decline in output, high inflation, and significant erosion of real wages.&#13;
Severance of transport links to traditional markets, owing to the conflict in Chechnya and political&#13;
problems with Iran, has compounded the deterioration in external trade and intensified output&#13;
contraction. As a consequence, Azerbaijan's GDP was half its 1989 level by the end of 1993, and&#13;
is estimated to have contracted by a further 22 percent in 1994. Although the official figures on&#13;
output may fail to include some informal sector activities, there is no doubt that the declines have&#13;
been particularly severe even relative to other FSU countries.&#13;
1.3   Since independence, Azerbaijan has experienced several changes in government and&#13;
considerable political instability. However, since late 1994, the current President has appeared to&#13;
be in firmer control of the country and government apparatus, to the extent that Parliamentary&#13;
elections were held in mid-November of 1995. The Government has also taken a number of&#13;
important steps to liberalize economic activity and promote the transition from a centrally managed&#13;
to a market economy. A national currency has been introduced, most prices have been liberalized,&#13;
some financial sector reforms have been initiated, and a buoyant and rapidly expanding private&#13;
sector has emerged in trading activities. A more appropriate legal and institutional framework to&#13;
support these reforms is being developed. However, structural reforms, such as privatization, have&#13;
been relatively slow to take off.&#13;
B.   The Energy Sector&#13;
1.4   The energy sector has played a key role in the development of Azerbaijan's economy.&#13;
Azerbaijan's initial economic growth was largely driven by oil exports, and by the subsequent&#13;
development of industries in support of oil and gas production. However, oil production has fallen&#13;
sharply since 1970, and the growth of other industries has reduced the relative importance of the&#13;
sector. Gas production has also declined rapidly in recent years, and the country is no longer self&#13;
sufficient in energy, and relies on gas imports to meet its energy needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
1.5   The structure of Azerbaijan's energy balance is relatively straight-forward with oil and gas&#13;
accounting for about 97 percent of primary energy supply, and hydropower and biomass providing&#13;
the remainder (see Annex 1.1). Most non-transport energy demands are met from natural gas or fuel&#13;
oil. Power stations are largely designed to use gas, although they can (and currently do) use fuel oil.&#13;
Industrial boilers are almost all designed to use gas, and households rely on natural gas for a&#13;
significant proportion of their energy requirements - although gas-fired district heating also plays&#13;
an important role in urban regions. Residential reliance on natural gas, especially in small towns and&#13;
rural areas, is attributable in part to past policies to extend the natural gas network throughout the&#13;
country irrespective of whether this was economically viable. However, the Government proposes&#13;
in the future to rationalize the gas supply network, confining natural gas supply to major centers and&#13;
customers and to meet the energy needs of less densely populated regions with Liquefied Petroleum&#13;
Gas (LPG) and liquid fuels. Thus, the energy balance is expected, over time, to shift towards&#13;
decreasing reliance on natural gas, at least for customers in rural areas.&#13;
1.6   The economy is highly energy intensive, even by the standards of the FSU. In 1990, its fuel&#13;
use per unit of GDP was the third highest of the FSU countries. In addition, the severe economic&#13;
contraction of recent years has not been accompanied by a proportional decline in energy use. While&#13;
energy prices to industries have been steadily increased and now approach economic levels,&#13;
industrial customers have generally failed to respond to price signals by improving their efficiency,&#13;
choosing instead to accumulate arrears in the absence of actions on the part of energy companies to&#13;
cut off supply to non-paying customers. Energy prices to households, at least for essential supplies&#13;
such as electricity and gas, remain well below cost recovery, even on a short-run marginal cost basis.&#13;
This imposes an additional financial burden on energy suppliers, and acts as a disincentive to&#13;
improved efficiency in either supply or consumption.&#13;
1.7   Despite its long history of oil production, Azerbaijan could benefit from large remaining oil&#13;
resources in newly discovered fields, and the oil sector could again dominate the country's future&#13;
development. The Government attaches great importance to private sector involvement in this&#13;
development, and has signed agreements with international oil companies regarding the development&#13;
of large off-shore oil fields in the Caspian Sea. Initial production under these agreements is expected&#13;
in late 1997, with full development after the year 2000. Further agreements are being considered&#13;
and negotiated to develop additional fields and to rehabilitate existing oil and gas deposits. Large-&#13;
scale development of oil, however, will also require construction of new export pipelines to reach&#13;
world markets.&#13;
C.    Government Strategy and Bank/IDA Role&#13;
1.8   The Government considers a combination of rapid price stabilization, restoration of external&#13;
balance, and accelerated structural reform as the only viable route to stability and growth. The&#13;
authorities have agreed a macroeconomic program with the IMF, focussing on controlling inflation,&#13;
improving external reserves, and limiting accumulation of non-concessional debt. Efforts are under&#13;
way to reduce the deficit, liberalize trade and prices, and reform the enterprise sector so as to foster&#13;
greater competition and private sector development. A privatization bill has been passed which&#13;
provides a framework for privatizing all small and medium-sized enterprises through a combination&#13;
of cash-based and voucher-based programs, and also for corporatizing those enterprises which will&#13;
remain, at least for some time, in the public sector. At the same time, the Government is taking steps&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
to reform the social protection system, with a view to better meeting the needs of poor and&#13;
vulnerable segments of the population within the limitations of the resources available.&#13;
1.9   The Bank is supporting the reform agenda through the extension of IDA Credits. A&#13;
Rehabilitation Credit of SDR 41.6 million has been concluded, which focussed on supporting the&#13;
program of structural reform of the enterprise sector. A Petroleum Technical Assistance Credit of&#13;
SDR 14.3 million is in place to finance studies and advisory services in support of the on-going&#13;
development of oil and natural gas resources. A Baku Water Supply Project Credit for SDR 38.8&#13;
million has been approved to finance, jointly with EBRD, urgently needed investments in&#13;
rehabilitating the water supply system, and an Institution Building Technical Assistance Credit for&#13;
SDR 11.5 million is in place to strengthen the capabilities of government institutions.&#13;
II. PROJECT CONTEXT AND STRATEGY&#13;
A.    Institutional Setting&#13;
2.1   The key agencies involved in the supply of gas within Azerbaijan are the State Oil Company&#13;
of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), and the gas transmission/distribution enterprise, Azerigaz.&#13;
SOCAR is responsible for gas production, both from offshore and onshore fields. Most of the gas&#13;
comes from offshore fields, generally in the form of associated gas; onshore fields account for only&#13;
a small fraction of production (0.2 BCM out of 6.7 BCM in 1995). SOCAR uses approximately 1&#13;
BCM in its own operations and delivers the balance either to the Karadag gas processing plant (GPP)&#13;
or directly into the Azerigaz network. Due to the poor condition of the Karadag plant and inadequate&#13;
pipeline infrastructure, less than half of the gas is currently processed; consequently, much of the&#13;
gas delivered to Azerigaz is high in both water content and heavier hydrocarbons. Feasibility studies&#13;
on replacing the existing GPP are currently underway under the Petroleum Technical Assistance&#13;
Project, and dehydration facilities are expected to be installed on existing gas wells in conjunction&#13;
with additional compression which will be needed to maintain their output. However in the interim,&#13;
the water content in particular imposes a cost in terms of accelerated deterioration of the gas&#13;
transmission and distribution facilities.&#13;
2.2   Azerigaz purchases gas from SOCAR and other sources, and distributes it to over 1 million&#13;
customers (residential, industrial and communal services) through a number of regional operating&#13;
departments.' Until the early 1990's, gas from Turkmenistan was also shipped through Azerbaijan&#13;
from the North Caucasus to Georgia and Armenia; this flow has virtually ceased, however, as a&#13;
result of both the war with Armenia and the economic problems in the region. Azerigaz was formed&#13;
in 1992 through the merging of the gas transmission operations of Aztransgas with the branches of&#13;
the State Fuel Committee responsible for gas and LPG distribution to customers. Azerbaijan is&#13;
among the most widely gasified countries in the world, and the gas transmission/distribution network&#13;
extends to over 80 percent of the population, and comprises 4,500 km of high pressure transmission&#13;
lines, 7 compressor stations and over 31,000 km of medium and low pressure distribution lines. In&#13;
addition to natural gas supply, Azerigaz also has departments responsible for gas storage (with sites&#13;
at Kalmas and Karadag), supply of LPG, pipeline construction and maintenance, scientific research&#13;
I     There are 18 regional transmission branches and 12 regional distribution companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
and planning, equipment production and banking. An organization chart for the Company is&#13;
provided in Annex 2.1.&#13;
2.3    Considerable progress has been made in rationalizing the operations of the company. Total&#13;
employment has been cut from 22,000 to its current level of approximately 16,000. In addition, the&#13;
company has recently proposed further consolidation of some of its research and maintenance&#13;
activities, and plans to devolve some of its non-core activities such as construction and LPG&#13;
distribution. However. there is still room for further rationalization and improved efficiency.&#13;
Operations are scattered among a number of offices, activities are extensively duplicated, and lines&#13;
of communication and authority are weak. Furthermore, company staff have had little access to&#13;
modem management tools and techniques (computers, training) to assist them in upgrading their&#13;
operations.&#13;
2.4   The pipeline network itself is generally in a poor state of repair. Minimal funds have been&#13;
available in recent years to carry out maintenance or to replace pipe that has passed its design life.&#13;
Compression is inadequate, both offshore and onshore, and Azerigaz has used high pressure imports&#13;
from Turkmenistan in order to maintain reasonable delivery pressures in the outlying regions.&#13;
System losses are very high, averaging 15 percent. Of this, at least 10 percent is estimated to be non-&#13;
technical losses - i.e. gas which is used by customers but not billed as a result of faulty or absent&#13;
meters, meter tampering or illegal connections. The remaining 5 percent is believed to be technical&#13;
losses from system leakage. However, the exact split between technical and non-technical losses&#13;
is difficult to establish since metering of the system is incomplete. While city gate stations and most&#13;
large customers are metered, the meters are old, and are often faulty, inappropriately sized or&#13;
inaccurate. Smaller enterprises and almost all residential customers are not metered but are billed&#13;
based on "norms" - consumption units which are linked to other indicators such as the size of the&#13;
service pipe, number of occupants, types of equipment installed, etc.2 While generally the norms&#13;
are substantially higher than the measured consumption of similar types of equipment in other&#13;
countries, they are insufficient to account for the full amount of gas which is supplied.&#13;
B.    Supply/Demand Outlook&#13;
2.5    Azerbaijan's gas production has declined precipitously in recent years, from a high of&#13;
approximately 13 BCM in 1986 to an estimated 6.7 BCM in 1995 (of which approximately 5.7 BCM&#13;
was available for sale to customers). While demand has also declined steadily since 1990, imports&#13;
have been restricted due to the rise in Turkmen gas prices to "world levels", and it has been&#13;
necessary to curtail gas use in power generation through substitution with fuel oil. In 1994, imports&#13;
accounted for 2.2 BCM, or 30 percent of Azerigaz's total gas supply. The decline in domestic&#13;
supply was partially offset in 1994 with the installation (by the U.S. company Pennzoil) of a&#13;
compressor at the Oil Rocks field to allow capture of up to 1.4 BCM/yr of gas from the Guneshli&#13;
field which was previously vented. However, the outlook for domestic supply shows little likelihood&#13;
of additional improvement until the new offshore oil fields approach full development (not expected&#13;
until post-2000), and could in fact deteriorate further unless investments are undertaken to redress&#13;
some of the major problems. While some of these investments are relatively modest (e.g.&#13;
2     "Norms" are used as a basis for residential gas billing in much of the FSU, including the Russian&#13;
Federation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
approximately US$6 million for piping systems to recapture 0.4 BCM of gas currently being vented),&#13;
others, such as installation of additional compressor capacity at some of the declining fields, would&#13;
require investments in excess of US$ 1 00 million.&#13;
2.6   Total gas consumption fell from 17 BCM in 1990 to approximately 7.5 BCM in 1994, but&#13;
a large part of the reduction came from curtailment of supply to the power sector. Between 1992 and&#13;
1994, most of the remaining decline in sales was accounted for by industrial customers, whose&#13;
consumption fell by 0.9 BCM or 25 percent in 1993 and by a further 0.3 BCM or 13 percent in 1994.&#13;
Figures for 1995 show an additional 10 percent decline over the previous year. In part, however, this&#13;
drop may be attributable to the Government decision to curtail imports in 1995 (see para 2.9).&#13;
Communal sales have also declined over the period. However, demand by residential customers has&#13;
remained relatively constant, and hence has increased as a share of total consumption.&#13;
2.7   Recent experience, together with the short-term outlook for weak industrial growth, suggests&#13;
a continuing decline in industrial consumption which is unlikely to be reversed in the near future,&#13;
particularly if payment discipline is imposed and supply is cut off to non-paying customers. The&#13;
forecast therefore uses 1994 as a base year, and assumes that industrial consumption will fall by 25&#13;
percent through 1998 (when it is expected that offshore oil developments will begin to revitalize the&#13;
economy), and increase by 1 percent per annum thereafter. Zero growth has been projected in&#13;
residential and communal sales, on the basis that the positive effects of income and population&#13;
growth and of cross-price elasticities would be offset by improved end-use efficiency, and by&#13;
rationalization of the rural gas network and hence a reduction in the number of customers served.&#13;
2.8   Table 2.1 below shows the gas supply/demand balances from 1992 through to the year 2000.&#13;
Supply projections assume that no large investments are undertaken during this period to increase&#13;
domestic gas production, but include approximately 0.4 BCM per year of supply as a result of early&#13;
oil development in 1999 and 2000. Generally, the projections indicate an increasing dependency on&#13;
imported gas, despite the drop in consumption, with required imports almost doubling from 2.2&#13;
BCM in 1994 to 4 BCM in 2000.&#13;

C.    Issues&#13;
2.9    Gas Supply: As noted above, domestic gas supply has been dropping rapidly in recent years,&#13;
and, unless substantial investment is undertaken in compression, collection systems and well&#13;
rehabilitation, is likely to continue to decline over at least the next 5 years. In the past, Azerbaijan&#13;
has filled the increasing gap between demand and supply with imports, both from Turkmenistan and&#13;
from Iran. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, Turkmenistan increased prices for gas&#13;
to world parity levels, while the Iranians increased their export prices to even higher levels. As a&#13;
result of poor customer payments and inadequate margins, Azerigaz was unable in 1994 to pay for&#13;
the Turkmen gas and incurred a debt of approximately $81 million. Agreement was reached with&#13;
Turkmenistan for repayment of this debt in approximately equal installments over 4 years, and&#13;
Azerigaz was meeting the proposed schedule.3 The Government, however, decided that it was&#13;
3      By May 1, 1996, Azerigaz had paid off over $40 million of the debt, and expect to repay the remaining&#13;
outstanding balance by the end of the year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
unacceptable to incur further foreign currency debts for gas supply, particularly when gas losses are&#13;
high, and instructed that no further gas would be imported during the winter of 1995/96. Supply has&#13;
been cut-off to most of the country and gas is being supplied in full only to Baku and Sumgait4.&#13;
Meanwhile, SOCAR has been ordered to increase gas production, although there does not appear&#13;
to be a coordinated plan as to how this can be done either technically, economically or financially.&#13;
The Government has not made any official statements with regard to its intentions beyond the&#13;
1995/96 winter. The projections of domestic supply suggest, however, that if the ban on imports is&#13;
extended, more severe supply curtailments will be needed.&#13;
2.10   The Bank has questioned these decisions on a number of grounds. First, the restriction of&#13;
supply does not, in itself, address the problem of losses. Non-technical losses (which are the major&#13;
issue) can only be addressed through a comprehensive program of metering and a strong corporate&#13;
effort to identify and prosecute fraudulent uses. Secondly, not providing gas to a significant segment&#13;
of the population raises the demands for other forms of energy such as fuelwood, LPG and kerosene,&#13;
whose economic costs could exceed the cost of gas imports.5 Generating additional electricity&#13;
requires additional fuel oil, which could otherwise be exported or used in other domestic&#13;
applications, and the stability of the electricity distribution system could be jeopardized if loads&#13;
increase significantly. The relatively high prices of kerosene, LPG and fuelwood will stretch the&#13;
budgets of the population, and may not be affordable to the poor. (Annex 2.2 provides a comparison&#13;
of the unit cost of alternative household fuels). Use of fuelwood is also damaging to the&#13;
environment. In addition, these substitute fuels may not be available in sufficient quantities to meet&#13;
the increased demand. Filling the gap will require imports (official or unofficial) of LPG and liquid&#13;
fuels, or changes in the pattern of domestic supply (changes in the refining mix, investments in&#13;
additional distribution facilities, etc.). Lack of gas for fuel also affects industrial outputs. Some of&#13;
these impacts were already being observed at the time of appraisal (January, 1996). The overall&#13;
economic cost of curtailing gas supply probably exceeds the savings on gas imports.&#13;
2.11  The Governnent needs to take a more integrated, long-term view of the issue of gas supply,&#13;
rather than continuing to manage supply on a "crisis" basis. Feasibility studies are needed on the&#13;
options for increasing domestic supply, both to ensure that the options are economic and to attract&#13;
necessary investment funds.6 In addition, the question of restrictions on imports needs to be re-&#13;
assessed in the context of the impact on the total economy. If gas is being wasted, either through&#13;
losses or through use by non-productive sectors of the economy, these problems should be addressed&#13;
through appropriate metering and pricing. Denying supply to large segments of the country, while&#13;
continuing to indiscriminately supply other regions does little to resolve the problem.&#13;
2.12   Gas Prices: The system of gas pricing in Azerbaijan is seriously distorted. These distortions&#13;
directly contravene long-term objectives of increasing the supply of domestic gas, encouraging&#13;
4      The limitation in the areas supplied is attributable in part to the fact that Azerigaz's compression problems&#13;
have been aggravated by the loss of high pressure Turkmen gas.&#13;
5     In the Survey of Living Conditions carried out in November/December 1995 in conjunction with the&#13;
ongoing World Bank Poverty Assessment, over 40 percent of the population reported using fuelwood as their&#13;
primary fuel for heating and cooking.&#13;
6     Studies on rehabilitation of mature offshore fields are being undertaken as part of the Petroleum Technical&#13;
Assistance Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
efficient use of gas by customers, and preserving the financial viability of the gas company. Gas&#13;
purchased from SOCAR is priced at US$10.80/MCM equivalent ($9.00/MCM to SOCAR, plus 20&#13;
percent royalty)7. Gas imports from Turkmenistan are priced nominally at US$80.00/MCM, but&#13;
payment is made in commodities and the effective price is estimated to be approximately&#13;
US$43.00/MCM. Including 15 percent losses, the effective cost of gas sold is $12.40/MCM from&#13;
SOCAR and $49.50/MCM from Turkmenistan. Selling prices to customers are similarly distorted,&#13;
both across sectors and relative to gas purchase prices, with residential prices at $2.80/MCM8, as&#13;
compared with $23.60/MCM for communal and $53.30/MCM for industrial use.&#13;
2.13   With respect to stimulating domestic supply of gas, while the current price to SOCAR of&#13;
$9.00/MCM is more realistic than the previous price of $3.50/MCM, it is unlikely to be sufficient&#13;
in the long term to attract the funding needed to develop significant additional gas supplies.9&#13;
Consequently, the recent gas price increase must be viewed as first step in a longer term program&#13;
which provides adequate incentives for increased gas production. This will also require suitable long&#13;
term purchase contracts. The Government has confirmed its intention to undertake, within a&#13;
reasonable time frame, a review of the producer pricing system for gas which addresses the&#13;
investment needs of gas development and also the need to attract foreign investment to gas&#13;
development projects. In addition, the arrears problem needs to be urgently addressed (see para&#13;
2.23). High prices will not be a sufficient incentive for development without corresponding&#13;
assurances that the gas will be paid for.&#13;
2.14   As regards the financial viability of the gas company, while Azerigaz currently has a positive&#13;
spread between average selling and purchase prices, the situation is tenuous. The positive balance&#13;
could be quickly eradicated by small shifts in either the proportion of sales to the higher tariff&#13;
customers (industrial and communal) or the proportion of imports to total gas supply. Furthermore,&#13;
the spread or margin currently budgeted in the tariff to cover operating and maintenance costs and&#13;
depreciation on the transmission and distribution systems is less than US$2.00/MCM, which is&#13;
inadequate even given the relatively low cost of local inputs, and certainly does not leave a margin&#13;
for capital expenditures.'" Based on the projected supply/demand balance shown in Table 2.1&#13;
(including essential imports in 1996) and the current pricing structure, Azerigaz's costs of gas supply&#13;
would exceed revenues in 1996 by approximately US$27 million - equivalent to a loss of&#13;
$4.40/MCM of sales."&#13;
7      Prior to November 1, 1995, the price to SOCAR was equivalent to only US$3.50/MCM.&#13;
8      The residential price was increased from $1.40/MCM to $2.80/MCM from June 1, 1996 as a condition of&#13;
Project Negotiations.&#13;
9      The compressor and pipeline sections which were constructed at Oil Rocks, for example, cost $160 million&#13;
and yielded incremental supplies of approximately 1.4 BCM per year. At a 10% cost of capital and 10 year&#13;
amortization, this equates to a cost of roughly $18.50/MCM.&#13;
10     By contrast, average distribution margins on gas sales in Russia are in excess of USS5.00/MCM. In&#13;
addition, the Russian margin excludes the costs of transmission to the city gate.&#13;
I I    If import curtailment continues, the projected supply/demand balance, which preserves current market&#13;
shares for each sector, would provide an adequate margin on 1996 sales at current prices. However, the economic&#13;
and social costs of the curtailment are viewed as unacceptably high, and financial viability remains vulnerable to&#13;
small shifts in sectoral shares of the market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
2.15  In order to ensure the financial viability of the sector, gas prices to consumers will have to&#13;
increase. There is little scope for further increases in industrial gas prices, which are already close&#13;
to parity with the economic (and financial) costs of alternative fuels. Hence, price increases will&#13;
have to focus on the residential and communal sectors. Residential prices in particular need to be&#13;
adjusted. Not only are they below the short run cost of supply, but they are only a fraction of the&#13;
cost of alternative fuels, and are significantly less than prices in other FSU countries (see Annex 2.2).&#13;
The Government has therefore agreed to maintain all prices at not less than their current levels in&#13;
real terms, and to make quarterly upward adjustments to communal and residential gas prices as&#13;
necessary so as to ensure Azerigaz an average annual operating margin of at least US$4.00/MCM&#13;
equivalent (in constant 1996 dollars) based on reasonable projections of gas sales and purchases.&#13;
In addition, as an indication of commitment to price reform, the Government agreed to implement&#13;
a two-times increase in residential gas prices (to 12,700 manats/MCM or US$2.80 equivalent), as&#13;
a condition of Credit negotiations. The Government has also agreed, by January 31, 1997, to prepare&#13;
a schedule acceptable to IDA for further increases in residential gas prices to equate them to at least&#13;
the cost of gas purchases. This schedule would be coordinated with both the introduction of&#13;
residential meters and the development of a mechanism to protect low-income households from&#13;
adverse impacts of price increases (see para 2.17 and 2.19).&#13;
2.16 Coordination of Energy Policy: Responsibility for the energy sector in Azerbaijan is&#13;
divided among a number of government agencies (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy,&#13;
Cabinet of Ministers, Office of the President) and state-owned enterprises (SOCAR, Azerigaz, the&#13;
State Fuel Committee, Azerenerji, etc). In the absence of a coordinating unit, which can research&#13;
issues and advise the Government on sector-wide implications of policies, decisions are sometimes&#13;
taken to address a problem in one area which have substantial adverse impacts in other areas. An&#13;
example is the recent decision to terminate gas imports from Turkmenistan. The implications of this&#13;
decision on the demands for electricity and other fuels, on the environment, on the social welfare of&#13;
the population outside the major urban centers, and on the financial viability of Azerigaz do not seem&#13;
to have been fully taken into account in evaluating the net benefits of the scheme. The Government&#13;
has been strongly urged to establish, if not an energy ministry, at least an energy coordinating&#13;
commission which could prepare an integrated energy strategy for the country, and provide policy&#13;
recommendations to the Governnent for its consideration.&#13;
2.17  Gas Meters: A comprehensive program of extending metering to all customers is an urgent&#13;
priority in Azerbaijan, to reduce non-technical losses attributable to inadequate norms, to reduce&#13;
opportunities for fraud and illegal connections, and to provide Azerigaz with essential information&#13;
on gas flows and technical losses. Meters are also essential if customers are to have an incentive to&#13;
use gas more efficiently. The proposed project will finance the metering of all major industrial and&#13;
commercial customers, and will finance improved instrumentation at city gate stations. However,&#13;
the full benefits of metering will only be achieved once meters are also installed at households.&#13;
Household meters will also help to alleviate the impacts of increases in residential gas prices, since&#13;
households will be able to control their gas bills by opting to reduce their consumption. Azerigaz&#13;
and the Government have therefore agreed to develop, by January 31, 1997, a program to extend&#13;
metering to cover all residential customers, with priority assigned to the coverage of single-family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
dwellings and apartments which use gas for multiple purposes (e.g., cooking, heating, hot water)"2.&#13;
The program will include a timetable for completion, and a financing plan to cover the cost of the&#13;
meters and of their installation.&#13;
2.18   Social Impacts of Gas Price Increases: Affordability of gas supply is an issue of major&#13;
concern for a significant segment of the population, and care will have to be taken to ensure that&#13;
relief is provided in cases of genuine hardship. However, affordability and the social impacts of&#13;
price increases have also been used by the Government as an argument against any meaningful&#13;
increase in residential prices. In fact, uniformly low prices result in a substantial transfer of welfare&#13;
to the wealthy, who receive their gas at the same price as the poor, and may in fact consume larger&#13;
volumes as they have larger dwellings and may use appliances more intensively. In addition, the&#13;
concern over affordability may be exaggerated. Prior to the recent doubling of residential gas prices,&#13;
a typical household using gas for heating, hot water and cooking was paying under 1 percent of&#13;
monthly income for gas (approximately 2,000 manats or 45 cents per month, as compared with an&#13;
average stated household income of $55.00'3). There is substantial scope to increase prices for&#13;
households at average and above average incomes, and a 7 to 10 times increase should not be&#13;
unreasonable. Moreover, the billing norms (i.e. the amounts of gas for which customers are charged)&#13;
are significantly higher than the measured consumption of western households for similar&#13;
applications.'4 This would suggest that, once meters are installed, many households may find that&#13;
their gas costs decrease by virtue of proper measurement, while others will be able to decrease their&#13;
costs by taking basic steps to conserve gas (such as turning off the cooker when it is not in use).&#13;
2.19 While households at and above average income levels would not be unduly affected by&#13;
significant increases in residential gas prices, households in the lowest income deciles could have&#13;
difficulty in accommodating higher gas costs. (A more detailed analysis of the distribution of&#13;
incomes and expenditures is contained in Annex 2.3). With a 10-fold increase in prices, basic&#13;
quantities of gas for cooking and heating would cost over 10 percent of income for low income&#13;
households (defined as the average of the first 3 income deciles) in the winter months. Arguably,&#13;
some of these households are already paying even higher proportions of income for energy, since&#13;
the recent curtailment in gas supply has forced them to use higher cost fuels. Provision should be&#13;
made for a targeted program of income support to ensure that lower income households can afford&#13;
an adequate supply of energy. Proposals in this regard are currently being evaluated in consultation&#13;
with the Poverty Assessment team, and the Government has agreed that a targeted mitigation&#13;
program for low-income households from adverse impacts of higher energy prices will be initiated&#13;
in conjunction with the proposed program of residential gas price increases. Some of the cost of&#13;
12    Metering of individual apartments, particularly where gas is used only for cooking, may not be cost&#13;
effective. In these cases, consideration can be given to installing meters either on risers or for the building as a&#13;
whole, and allowing tenants to agree a basis for apportioning the bill among individual units.&#13;
13    Preliminary data, Azerbaijan Survey of Living Conditions, carried out in November/December 1995 in&#13;
conjunction with the ongoing World Bank Poverty Assessment.&#13;
14    For example, norms for cooking and water heating are 31.5 m3/person/month - or 126 m3/month for a 4&#13;
person household. By comparison, metered household consumption in Germany for cooking and water heating is&#13;
approximately 33 m3/month.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
such a program could be covered by eliminating poorly targeted gas subsidies, such as those now&#13;
accorded to teachers and working pensioners."5&#13;
2.20 Institutional Issues: As noted above, Azerigaz was created by the merger of a number of&#13;
disparate entities. System-wide, it has some 16,000 employees, operating in a number of geographic&#13;
regions. Notwithstanding the decentralization of many activities, strategic planning and decision-&#13;
making are tightly controlled at the senior management level. As a state owned enterprise, Azerigaz&#13;
has not been encouraged, or even allowed to operate on a commercial basis. Prices, margins and&#13;
service policies are set by the central government, and funds for capital expenditures are allotted&#13;
from central budgets, often based on the availability of funds for particular transactions rather than&#13;
on the prioritization of investment requirements and competitive selection of the most cost-effective&#13;
technology.&#13;
2.21   Azerigaz has put forward proposals for its conversion to an independent joint stock company,&#13;
and has prepared a draft charter for government review. Any restructuring will be carried out within&#13;
the context of the Government's current privatization program. Given the lack of a legislative or&#13;
regulatory framework for the gas sector, privatization would be premature at this time. However,&#13;
corporatization should move forward, initially with a view to introducing a more commercial&#13;
orientation into the company's operations, including separate accountability on the part of the&#13;
various operating divisions. Transparency of transactions between divisions is important, especially&#13;
between transmission and distribution activities. Ultimately, the objective would be the separation&#13;
of transmission and distribution. Social services should be transferred to the public sector.&#13;
Competitive service activities (e.g. construction) can be spun off. Private participation in some or&#13;
all of the activities can be introduced once the proper regulatory framework is in place. This&#13;
objective should be taken into account in defining the corporate structure, possibly through a holding&#13;
company/subsidiary structure which divides operating assets among the various operating divisions.&#13;
The Government has issued a Presidential Decree ordering the establishment of Azerigas as a joint&#13;
stock society, with shares held initially by the State Property Committee. The Government agreed&#13;
to complete the corporatization process by September 30, 1996 under a charter which reflects the&#13;
commercial focus of the company, and also the ultimate separability of its various activities. The&#13;
Government has also expressed its commitment to timely passage of a gas legislation, based in part&#13;
on work to be undertaken with EU-TACIS financing.&#13;
2.22  A related issue under the subject of institutional reform is the immediate need to address&#13;
major problems in LPG supply. LPG bottling and distribution is currently handled by one of&#13;
Azerigaz's operating departments. While supply has declined dramatically in recent years, it is&#13;
expected to increase as petroleum output rises and new gas processing facilities are constructed.&#13;
LPG demand is also expected to rise in conjunction with overall growth in incomes and&#13;
rationalization of the rural natural gas supply system. (Annex 2.4 provides additional background&#13;
detail on the current structure of the LPG industry.) However, in order to serve expected market&#13;
growth, substantial investments will be needed to acquire new and replacement equipment, both for&#13;
bottling and transport. It has been proposed to meet these investment needs by separating Azerigaz's&#13;
LPG operation from the rest of the company, and soliciting private participation (either whole or&#13;
partial) in its operations and development. The Government has expressed its agreement to establish&#13;
15    About 50% of residential consumers benefit from concessions on gas tariffs, ranging from 10% to 100%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
LPG distribution as a separate company, and to privatize it in a manner which attracts significant&#13;
investment from a qualified foreign company, while maintaining competitive conditions for LPG&#13;
distribution. The Government plans to use funds available under the Institution Building Technical&#13;
Assistance (TA) Project to support the privatization process, within the framework of the overall&#13;
privatization program.&#13;
2.23  Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable are a problem throughout the economy, but tend&#13;
to focus ultimately in the energy sector because, for legal, political and often technical reasons,&#13;
customers continue to be supplied even though they are not paying for the energy they receive. All&#13;
of the energy enterprises in Azerbaijan are running substantial arrears in collections. Enterprises&#13;
which supply end users (Azerenerji, Azerigaz, the State Fuel Committee and the district heating&#13;
companies) are unable to collect in a timely manner, if at all. In turn, they are building up arrears&#13;
among themselves and with SOCAR and the SOCAR refineries. Azerigaz's accounts receivable&#13;
from customers total approximately 300 billion manats - of which approximately 180 billion manats&#13;
is due from Azerenerji - and Azerigaz in turn owes corresponding amounts to SOCAR.&#13;
2.24  The buildup of arrears causes serious problems both for the enterprises and for the&#13;
Government. Productive companies are unable to generate the cash needed to purchase supplies and&#13;
equipment and to pay workers. They are also unable to reimburse the Government for taxes due.&#13;
Those which can access commercial credit are obliged to borrow, at high cost, to meet their&#13;
obligations. The impact of price increases, in terms of encouraging increased production or more&#13;
efficient use of resources, is weakened. In addition, enterprises which are no longer productive or&#13;
economic continue to consume scarce resources, operating on the credit which is provided,&#13;
involuntarily, by their suppliers. Finally, the real value of accounts receivable erodes over time with&#13;
inflation.&#13;
2.25  Azerigaz has taken a number of actions to manage the accounts receivable problem, including&#13;
arranging mutual settlements, cutting off customers where possible, and accepting goods in lieu of&#13;
cash settlements. However, they are still burdened with substantial and growing debts from the&#13;
power company (Azerenerji), budget organizations, and some of the larger state-owned industrial&#13;
enterprises, all of whom continue to be supplied with gas because it is either politically or legally&#13;
impossible to cut off supply. The Government has been urged to take immediate action to address&#13;
the issue of arrears at a national level, both to reduce existing arrears and prevent the accumulation&#13;
of further debts, and has passed a decree (No. 13, February 7, 1996) which requires end-users to pay&#13;
in advance for further supply of goods and services. However, in the case of the gas subsector, the&#13;
Government has only allowed partial implementation of the decree. The right to refuse further&#13;
supply to any customers who are not current on payments is essential if Azerigaz is to successfully&#13;
manage its payment arrears. Additional remedies, such as the right to attach assets of non-paying&#13;
customers, to impose severe penalties for non-payment, to demand prepayment for supply, or to&#13;
receive government compensation in the event that cut-offs are prohibited, could also be applied to&#13;
supplement the right to curtail supply. The Government and Azerigaz have therefore agreed to a&#13;
time-bound Action Plan to address arrears in the gas distribution sector. Specifically, the Plan&#13;
specifies dates after which Azerigaz would be required to supply to all customers on a prepayment&#13;
or letter of credit basis, with the exception of those agencies which are specifically exempted by the&#13;
Government. Further, in the event that these exempted agencies fail to make timely payment for gas&#13;
&#13;

Plan are given in Annex 2.5.&#13;
D.    Project Design Strategy&#13;
2.26   Given Azerbaijan's limited borrowing capacity and the constraints associated with IDA&#13;
funding, it has been agreed to focus initial lending to the gas subsector on items which address the&#13;
primary concerns of high gas losses, low efficiency of use, and high costs of maintaining the&#13;
operating integrity of the network. Hence, the project focuses on metering, upgrading of the&#13;
cathodic protection system, equipment for leak detection and gas quality analysis, and a limited&#13;
amount of TA to assist in project implementation and support the corporatization of Azerigaz.&#13;
Implementation of these initiatives should improve the cost-effectiveness of Azerigaz's operations,&#13;
which in turn will increase the funds available for additional investments. Larger investments are&#13;
required, in gas storage, the transmission system and in gas processing. However, these can only&#13;
be initiated once considerable additional detailed preparatory work has been undertaken.6&#13;
2.27   From the policy perspective, agreements have been obtained which will further improve the&#13;
financial position of Azerigaz (e.g. pricing, accounts receivable). In addition, initial steps will be&#13;
undertaken to corporatize Azerigaz, with the longer term objective of enabling the company to&#13;
operate on a commercial basis, enhancing its access to debt and equity financing, improving its&#13;
operating efficiency, and increasing the value of the Government's interest in the enterprise.&#13;
E.    Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.28   As noted in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which is to be discussed by the Board&#13;
concurrently with this project, the Bank's basic objective is to assist Azerbaijan in achieving a&#13;
balanced transition to a market economy. With regard to energy and energy infrastructure, there is a need&#13;
in the near term to maintain a basic provision of essential services to the population and to evolving&#13;
enterprises, while at the same time minimizing budgetary transfers. In the long term, a reliable, efficient and&#13;
financially self-sustaining system of energy supply is necessary for sustainable development. The proposed&#13;
Project promotes these objectives by supporting rehabilitation of existing facilities, reduction of gas losses,&#13;
and corporatization of the gas distribution sector. The Project will also encourage more efficient use of gas,&#13;
which will help to reduce energy costs, cut import requirements and increase foreign exchange available for&#13;
other uses. Private sector support for investments in natural gas infrastructure is constrained by the fact that&#13;
no direct export revenues are available and returns are dependent on a still-evolving regulatory system.&#13;
However, the project will facilitate Azerigaz's transition to a commercially-based operation and will support&#13;
development of a legal and regulatory framework for the sector, which are important first steps in&#13;
introducing a market-based sector organization, as well as attracting future private sector participation. The&#13;
privatization of the LPG business, within the policy framework of the project, will assist in broadening&#13;
private involvement in the energy sector.&#13;
16    A detailed feasibility study of underground storage investment is being funded by EU-TACIS in parallel&#13;
with this Project, at a cost of about $1.5 million.&#13;

F.    Lessons Learned from Past Operations&#13;
2.29  Bank financed projects in Azerbaijan are only at the initial stages of implementation.&#13;
However, experience to date with investment projects such as the Baku Water Supply Project and&#13;
the Petroleum TA Project has shown that, as in other FSU countries, institutional capacity is limited,&#13;
and responsibilities are often not well defined among government departments and enterprises.&#13;
There is also a lack of local familiarity with Bank procedures, particularly as regards procurement,&#13;
and the practical aspects of implementation, such as international communications and language&#13;
difficulties, can create delays. Bank practice in other FSU countries has been to devote a&#13;
considerable effort to general institution building and training among counterpart agencies and&#13;
government departments, to provide for a substantial degree of support to the project implementation&#13;
unit (PIU) within the project budget, and to allow for above-average levels of supervision effort.&#13;
The establishment of a fully-staffed Resident Mission in early 1996 has helped to resolve some of&#13;
the practical difficulties, and has improved coordination with and among government agencies.&#13;
2.30  The World Bank has financed a number of gas distribution and transmission projects.&#13;
Among the most pertinent lessons which have been learned are: (a) the importance of defining fully&#13;
the institutional framework for natural gas, including enterprise autonomy and regulation; (b) the&#13;
need for clear targets for gas price reform and for financial viability of gas enterprises; (c) the&#13;
importance of institutional strengthening of gas enterprises, coupled with the need for a long-term&#13;
approach to the process; (d) the importance of strengthening the contractual and operating relations&#13;
between the gas company, the gas suppliers, and the major gas consumers; and (e) the importance&#13;
of integrating gas supply forecasts with gas system investments. Along with assurances of financial&#13;
viability through appropriate pricing policies, it is also critical to ensure counterpart funding as&#13;
required.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Origin and Formulation&#13;
3.1    The Energy Sector Review carried out in 1993 ' emphasized the importance of natural gas&#13;
as a source of energy in Azerbaijan, but also recognized the need to improve the efficiency of gas&#13;
production, transport and use. In September 1993, the Japanese Government provided a grant to the&#13;
Government of Azerbaijan to finance a project preparation study, which would identify priority&#13;
investment requirements in gas transmission and distribution, and serve as a basis for project lending&#13;
by the World Bank and other international lending agencies. The consultants engaged to undertake&#13;
the project preparatory work found that the gas transmission/distribution enterprise, Azerigaz, was&#13;
suffering from a lack of investment in new capital equipment, replacement parts and modernization.&#13;
Existing metering equipment was outdated and inaccurate, the network was in a poor state of repair,&#13;
operations and maintenance of the pipeline systems were highly labor intensive and obsolete&#13;
equipment was often not replaced. Losses, both technical and non-technical, were high, and there&#13;
was little incentive to conserve energy. The consultants' report identified a number of necessary&#13;
investments, and outlined a priority program with a foreign cost of approximately US$90 million.&#13;
17    World Bank, Azerbaijan Energy Sector Review, Report No. 12061-AZ, December 27, 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
This included metering, pipe replacement, gas dehydration units, laboratory and testing equipment,&#13;
construction equipment, detailed reservoir studies and essential maintenance for the storage facilities,&#13;
equipment for LPG distribution, cathodic protection and planning studies for future network&#13;
development. The total amount of investment which was identified as being required in the medium&#13;
term is substantially higher (over $150 million), but further feasibility work is needed, particularly&#13;
as regards development and rehabilitation of transmission, gas treatment and storage facilities.&#13;
3.2    As a result of the restricted borrowing capability of the Government, together with the need&#13;
to allocate resources among a number of sectors, it was not possible to meet the full investment&#13;
needs of the gas subsector in the first Credit. Accordingly, based on detailed analysis of the costs&#13;
and benefits of various components, Azerigaz and the Bank defined a more limited project,&#13;
consisting of priority investments which would address the most pressing problems of the sector,&#13;
would yield high and early returns, and would contribute to long-term viability of the sector.&#13;
3.3   It was agreed that the proposed project would focus on the primary concerns of high gas&#13;
losses, low efficiency of use, and high costs of maintaining the operating integrity of the network.&#13;
Hence, the project includes metering, upgrading of the cathodic protection system, equipment for&#13;
leak detection and gas quality analysis, and a limited amount of TA and equipment to support project&#13;
implementation and the corporatization of Azerigaz. Implementation of these initiatives should&#13;
improve the cost-effectiveness of Azerigaz's operations, which in turn will increase the funds&#13;
available for additional investments.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
3.4    The principal objectives of the proposed project are to::&#13;
(a)   promote more efficient use of gas and reduce non-technical losses by replacing&#13;
obsolete and inaccurate metering, improving measurement instrumentation, installing&#13;
meters where none presently exist, and establishing associated meter proving&#13;
facilities;&#13;
(b)   improve the physical accounting for gas and encourage an improved commercial&#13;
basis for gas trading through the upgrading of metering and instrumentation;&#13;
(c)   ensure the efficient operation and preserve the value of the existing pipeline assets&#13;
through investments in cathodic protection, gas analysis and leak detection&#13;
equipment; and,&#13;
(d)   support the commercialization of Azerigaz and further development of the sector&#13;
through technical assistance, training programs and the acquisition of modem office&#13;
equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
C.    Project Description&#13;
3.5    The project is divided into four main components, each of which has several sub-&#13;
components. The components are: (a) metering; (b) cathodic protection (CP) rehabilitation; (c)&#13;
analytical equipment; and (d) corporatization support.&#13;
3.6    Metering: The metering component includes: (a) rehabilitation of the city gate meter&#13;
stations throughout Azerbaijan by replacing the existing instrumentation or by replacing the entire&#13;
meter at some stations; (b) installing new meters at industrial and large commercial consumers who&#13;
currently have no meters; and (c) rehabilitating the metering at the industrial consumers who&#13;
currently have meters by either replacing the meters or replacing the measuring instrumentation. In&#13;
addition, financing will be provided to acquire related meter proving equipment and equipment&#13;
packages to facilitate meter installation.&#13;
3.7    City Gate Stations: Approximately 214 meter sets at the city gate stations will be&#13;
rehabilitated or replaced under the project. This includes all the city gate stations which are currently&#13;
in operation in Azerbaijan and those industries which are fed directly from the main high pressure&#13;
pipeline. The program covers all of the locations where gas is currently delivered from the main&#13;
transmission pipelines. As a result, an improved measurement accounting will be achieved for the&#13;
gas sector within the country. Instrumentation rehabilitation will include installing flow computers,&#13;
transmitters and power supplies on existing orifice flow meters. The feasibility studies have shown&#13;
that the main cause of the existing inaccurate measurement is obsolete and faulty instrumentation.&#13;
3.8    New and Replacement Meters: Approximately 465 industrial and large commercial&#13;
consumers are currently operating without metering and these will have meters installed.&#13;
Approximately 690 industrial and large non-industrial consumers are currently operating with meters&#13;
which are either not functioning or are obsolete and inaccurate. The larger consumers will have&#13;
instrumentation replaced and some consumers will also have the meters replaced, where this is&#13;
justified. Initially, the meters will be procured as pre-assembled skid mounted packages to simplify&#13;
installation.&#13;
3.9    Meter Proving Equipment: Meter proving equipment will also be purchased for each meter&#13;
type and housed in appropriately constructed facilities that will meet international standards. This&#13;
would satisfy the requirement of the Azerbaijan State Standards Committee and would allow a&#13;
meter testing program for Azerbaijan comparable to international norms. A signed agreement to be&#13;
initiated between the State Standard Committee and Azerigaz on Project implementation procedure&#13;
was sent to the Bank on February 21, 1996.&#13;
3.10   Installation Equipment: This component includes three vehicles equipped with lifting and&#13;
welding equipment and necessary tools to modernize and facilitate installation of meter sets.&#13;
3.11   Cathodic Protection System Rehabilitation: The cathodic protection of the pipeline&#13;
system throughout Azerbaijan is in poor condition and in need of rehabilitation, largely as a result&#13;
of a lack of funds for investment. The CP rehabilitation component would focus on the Apsheron&#13;
peninsula and cover about 2,700 km of pipelines serving that area. This area was selected because&#13;
it is where most of the gas is currently transported and consumed, and for safety reasons as this is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
the area of highest population density. The rehabilitation program would include electrically&#13;
isolating the pipelines into discrete sections, designing the detailed CP requirements for each section&#13;
and installing the required CP equipment. A specialized consultant would assist Azerigaz in the&#13;
initial isolation of two sections, one on the transmission system and another one on the distribution&#13;
network, carrying out the design, and training Azerigaz to continue the work. In addition to the CP&#13;
equipment, an allowance for approximately 900 tons of large diameter pipe has been included in the&#13;
cost estimate. This would be used to replace seriously corroded pipe which is discovered during&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.12   Analytical Equipment: This component consists of three sub-components: (a) gas quality&#13;
test equipment; (b) leak detection equipment; and (c) computer software and hardware to undertake&#13;
network modeling. The gas quality test equipment would upgrade Azerigaz's gas analysis capability,&#13;
and would include gas sampling and analysis equipment to verify gas quality and heat content, and&#13;
improve gas accounting. The equipment would be used for on-site testing of gas supply by SOCAR&#13;
to Azerigaz, and housed in Karadag in a suitably constructed building in line with international&#13;
norms. The operational procedures for this gas testing center will be included in the supply&#13;
agreement to be signed between Azerigaz and SOCAR (para. 4.3). Leak detection equipment would&#13;
replace the existing equipment which is obsolete and in many cases not working; and network&#13;
modeling tools would assist Azerigaz in carrying out engineering analysis for system capacity and&#13;
design.&#13;
3.13  Corporatization Support: The Corporatization Support component of the project includes:&#13;
(a) assistance in project implementation; (b) training for Azerigaz staff; and (c) upgrading of office&#13;
equipment. Implementation assistance, which will be provided by consultants, would include&#13;
assistance in procurement, engineering, project management and accounting, and implementation&#13;
supervision (PEMS). Training would include assistance with company organization and&#13;
management and training in modern procedures for commercial operation (planning, budgeting,&#13;
finance, accounting, marketing, human resources management). Office equipment includes the&#13;
purchase of computer hardware and software to assist gas accounting, financial accounting, and&#13;
technical groups. An allowance has also been made for items of equipment and technical assistance&#13;
to support commercialization of Azerigaz, which will be identified as the process of corporatization&#13;
moves forward.&#13;
D.   Cost Estimate&#13;
3.14  The total project cost including physical and price contingencies is estimated at US$24.6&#13;
million equivalent, of which US$20.2 million, or about 82 percent, is the foreign exchange cost.&#13;
Physical contingencies were estimated at 15 percent of base cost on all items. Price contingencies&#13;
were estimated using the standard MUV index and the average price contingency is about 8 percent.&#13;
Since Azerigaz will not be subject to Value Added Tax (VAT) and import duties, these costs have&#13;
been excluded from the total project costs. Interest during construction will be borne by Azerigaz.&#13;
Local costs include the costs of establishing and maintaining the PIU, the costs of personnel and&#13;
equipment which will be involved in installation of new equipment, and the costs of facilities to&#13;
house items such as gas analysis and meter proving equipment. Summary project costs are shown&#13;
in Table 3.1. The cost estimate is shown in more detail in Annex 3.1.&#13;

E.     Project Financing Arrangements&#13;
3.15   An IDA Credit would be extended to the Government of Azerbaijan in the amount of SDR&#13;
14.1 million (US$20.2 million equivalent), and would cover the foreign currency portion of the&#13;
project. Azerigaz would finance US$4.4 million equivalent from internal cash generation to cover&#13;
local costs. The IDA Credit would be on standard IDA terms of 35 years repayment, including 10&#13;
years grace, a service charge of 0.75 percent and a commitment fee not to exceed 0.5 percent. The&#13;
Government would on-lend the full IDA Credit in dollar equivalents to Azerigaz at an interest rate&#13;
equal to the IBRD variable rate on currency pool loans, adjusted every six months.'8 Repayment&#13;
terms would be over 20 years, including 5 years grace. The proposed financing plan for the project&#13;
is summarized in Table 3.2.&#13;
3.16 Funds from the IDA Credit would be available to finance equipment, materials and technical&#13;
assistance for Azerigaz. A Credit Agreement has been concluded between IDA and the Government&#13;
of Azerbaijan. A Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) will be concluded between the Governrnent&#13;
of Azerbaijan and Azerigaz. The execution of a SLA satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of&#13;
18     The proposed onlending rate reflects a number of considerations, including the role of Azerigaz as a public&#13;
utility, and the financial constraints that it must operate under until residential gas prices can be adjusted to levels&#13;
that more fully reflect full operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Credit effectiveness. A Project Agreement between IDA and Azerigaz will facilitate the achievement&#13;
of project objectives and utilization of loan proceeds as intended. The Ministry of Finance will&#13;
represent the Government of Azerbaijan. A chart of lending arrangements, legal agreements, and&#13;
flow of funds is shown in Annex 3.2.&#13;

F.    Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.17  In accordance with Annex E of OD 4.01, the proposed project has been assigned Category&#13;
B classification. The project involves only rehabilitation and maintenance, and has no significant&#13;
or irreversible environmental impacts. The natural gas savings generated by the introduction of gas&#13;
meters would provide both direct and indirect environmental benefits. Direct benefits would include&#13;
reduction in acid and greenhouse gas emissions (NOX and C02) associated with lower consumption&#13;
of natural gas. In addition, reduction in natural gas leakages represents a significant benefit, since&#13;
methane emissions produce a greenhouse effect that is 20 to 50 times greater than carbon dioxide&#13;
for equivalent emissions. Indirect benefits would stem from the greater availability of natural gas&#13;
and LPG and their potential substitution for more polluting fuels such as wood and petroleum&#13;
products.&#13;
3.18  An environmental mitigation plan has been prepared to address potentially adverse project&#13;
impacts, and is described in Annex 3.3. Only two components of the system rehabilitation may have&#13;
a measurable impact on the physical environment: (a) replacement of degraded pipe; and (b)&#13;
cathodic protection. The impacts of these components would depend on the specific characteristics&#13;
of the locations involved which would only be determined during implementation. Mitigation&#13;
measures to be taken are described in the environmental mitigation plan, and include the&#13;
appointment of an environmental coordinator to work with the PIU and ensure that provisions in the&#13;
plan are carried out. During negotiations, Azerigaz agreed to adhere to the proposed mitigation plan&#13;
in implementing the project. Necessary preparation and training will be provided by the&#13;
Procurement Engineering Management and Supervision (PEMS) consultant during the project&#13;
implementation phase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
4.1    The existing project preparation unit within Azerigaz, which has worked closely with the&#13;
consultants and the World Bank preparation missions in defining and analyzing proposed&#13;
investments, will form the core of the PIU, supplemented by additional staff possessing relevant&#13;
qualifications. A project director would lead the team and will be supported by a technical manager,&#13;
a procurement specialist, finance manager and a logistics/administrative officer. An environmental&#13;
coordinator will also be appointed to ensure that the environmental mitigation plan is implemented.&#13;
Considering the substantial technical qualifications and experience of Azerigaz senior staff and their&#13;
understanding of the problems faced by the company, the suggested procedure will be to assign&#13;
existing senior staff to the key positions. Azerigaz has agreed, prior to Credit effectiveness, to&#13;
formally establish a PIU, and to appoint managerial, operational and support staff sufficient to&#13;
initiate project implementation.&#13;
4.2    Considering Azerigaz's lack of experience with international and Bank procedures,&#13;
especially with regard to financing and procurement, it is proposed that consultant support services&#13;
be provided for project implementation. The selected consultants would be conversant with World&#13;
Bank practices and would have the backing or support capabilities to carry out their work effectively.&#13;
The consultants will establish a nucleus project team in Azerigaz (resident in Baku). Specialists will&#13;
be provided as needed under the implementation schedule, traveling to Baku on a regular and on an&#13;
as required basis. In discussions with Azerigaz, terms of reference has been prepared (Annex 4. 1).&#13;
The Letter of Invitation for the PEMS consultants will be issued under a Project Preparation Facility&#13;
(PPF) advance. The PEMS consultants will be asked to bid based on a two-phase assignment, with&#13;
the first phase to cover finalization of technical specifications and bidding documents for initial&#13;
metering and leak detection packages. The second phase, which will commence following Credit&#13;
effectiveness, will cover the balance of the implementation period.&#13;
4.3    The PEMS consultants will be expected to provide the following consultant skill mix:&#13;
(a)   A Project Managerwill be provided to serve as a counterpart to the manager of the PIU and&#13;
to manage and co-ordinate the activities of other members of the PEMS consulting team.&#13;
This individual would be a specialist with expertise in design and management of gas&#13;
network projects. He/she would assist the PIU to finalize the technical specifications, and&#13;
would set up a project management system and train Azerigaz in its use.&#13;
(b)   A Metering Specialist would be required in the early stages of the project to finalize metering&#13;
designs, specifications and installation programs. Further assistance from this individual&#13;
may be required on a short-term basis when additional metering packages are being prepared.&#13;
(c)   A Procurement Specialist will advise and assist with the procurement process including the&#13;
preparation of tender documents, bid evaluations and contracts with suppliers of equipment&#13;
and services in accordance with Bank guidelines. The procurement specialist will also&#13;
recommend institutional changes to strengthen the capability to procure goods and services&#13;
from local and international sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(d) A Financial Analvst will assist the financial manager in establishing project accounting&#13;
systems and procedures, in engaging auditors, and in preparing financial statements that&#13;
conform to international standards and IDA requirements.&#13;
(e)   A specialized sub-consultant for Cathodic Protection will be hired to carry out the initial&#13;
detailed designs and implementation, train Azerigaz staff, set up a program for the survey&#13;
of the entire pipeline system and monitor the implementation of this component. The&#13;
consultant would also establish procedures for the definition and implementation of the&#13;
emergency pipe replacement program.&#13;
(f)    A Gas Sales and Purchase Contract Specialist will be provided on a short-term basis to assist&#13;
Azerigaz in: (a) supplementing the existing contracts with industrial and commercial&#13;
customers to provide for security, maintenance and operation of the new meter sets to be&#13;
installed at the customer sites; and (b) concluding a gas supply contract with SOCAR in line&#13;
with the industry norms providing particularly for operation of the new gas measurement&#13;
center to be installed in Karadag.&#13;
B.    Schedule&#13;
4.4    The project will be implemented over four years, starting in the third quarter of 1996 through&#13;
the fourth quarter of 2000. All components will be launched in the first two years of the project.&#13;
The proposed implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4.2. As noted above, it is expected that&#13;
the PEMS consultant contract would be signed prior to Credit effectiveness (with the second phase&#13;
subject to satisfactory performance during the PPF phase).  It is anticipated that the PEMS&#13;
consultants will be in place by the end of the 3rd quarter of 1996.&#13;
4.5    During 1996, Azerigaz will, with the assistance of the PEMS consultants, complete a&#13;
detailed customer survey for the proposed metering of large consumers and for the meter upgrading&#13;
at the city gate stations. This survey will confirm the need for metering at each premises, confirm&#13;
whether new or upgraded metering is required, determine the detailed design requirements, and&#13;
determine installation details for each consumer.&#13;
4.6    The Procurement process for the first package of the metering component, which will&#13;
include major city gate stations, will begin in the 4th quarter of 1996, and the first deliveries of&#13;
equipment will begin in approximately the 4th quarter of 1997. Procurement of industrial and&#13;
commercial meters will begin in the 3rd quarter of 1997, with subsequent packages to follow as&#13;
detailed specifications of individual customer requirements are finalized. Procurement of leak&#13;
detection equipment will also be initiated in the 4th quarter of 1996, with the first deliveries expected&#13;
in the 2nd quarter of 1997. Implementation of the cathodic protection component will begin in early&#13;
1997, with the consultants completing the initial surveys, implementation and training by the 3rd&#13;
quarter of 1997. Procurement of the gas quality equipment will be started in early 1998 following&#13;
design and specification studies. Including installation and commissioning, this component will be&#13;
completed by mid-1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
C.   Procurement Arrangements&#13;
4.7    Table 4.1 summarizes the procurement approaches to be used for the project. All Bank&#13;
financed goods and equipment will be procured in accordance with the "Guidelines: Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits," published in January 1995 and revised in January 1996.&#13;
Consultant services will be procured in accordance with the "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency", August 1981. The equipment&#13;
and services to be financed by IDA mostly consist of standard, conventional items available from&#13;
numerous suppliers worldwide. The project consists of 19 packages of which 10 packages with a&#13;
total estimated cost of US$18.2 million would be procured under International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB). It is proposed that 5 contracts for specialized goods such as test equipment and network&#13;
modeling, with an aggregate value of about US$2.3 million, would be procured under limited&#13;
international bidding (LIB) using IDA's standard bidding documents for goods. The remaining four&#13;
packages with total estimated value of about US$4.1 million for items such as PEMS, training and&#13;
office equipment will be procured in accordance with IDA Guidelines for selection of consultants&#13;
and through International Shopping (IS).&#13;
4.8    The first general procurement notice has been published in the UN Development Business&#13;
in the summer of 1996, and thereafter notices will be published annually about the same time&#13;
throughout the implementation period for all outstanding procurement. For the ICB packages,&#13;
specific procurement notices will be published both in local papers and UN Development Business.&#13;
4.9   Equipment installation will be performed primarily by the Construction Department of&#13;
Azerigaz (Azerigaz Glastroi) and by local contractors, hired using local procurement rules, and&#13;
financed by Azerigaz. Quotations will be obtained from local contractors and the contract will be&#13;
awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder. Azerigaz has recently established a transaction committee&#13;
to ensure proper implementation of these procedures as well as review of all the bids for&#13;
management approval. Construction works associated with equipment installation will be supervised&#13;
jointly by local construction management teams and equipment supplier representatives, as well as&#13;
by the PEMS consultant.&#13;
4.10  Consultants to provide implementation assistance and other technical assistance will be&#13;
selected in accordance with the "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
The World Bank as Executing Agency," August 1981. Azerigaz will select and manage the&#13;
Consultants and the selection procedure will be on a competitive basis using a short list of firms&#13;
proposed by Azerigaz and agreed by IDA. The Consultants would be employed under the World&#13;
Bank's "Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services for Complex Time-Based Assignments&#13;
- June 1995."&#13;

4.11    Qualified suppliers from  Azerbaijan will be encouraged to bid on procurement packages.&#13;
The bidding documents for ICB procurement will include the domestic preference, as per the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines, for goods manufactured locally, of 15 percent of the CIF price or the value of import&#13;
duties and charges, whichever is less. Considering the separable nature of most of the project&#13;
components, procurement arrangements will be structured so as to be sufficiently flexible to&#13;
accommodate adjustments in the work program during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

4.12  Azerigaz staff, assisted by the PEMS consultants, will be responsible for preparing and&#13;
maintaining detailed procurement plans. These plans will contain a list of bidding documents to be&#13;
issued and a schedule for each proposed contract, giving the date when the draft will be ready for&#13;
Bank review, when bid documents would be released, the bid opening date, the date the bid&#13;
evaluation report will be given to IDA for its review, the contract signing date, and the dates when&#13;
equipment will be delivered or services rendered. Equipment procurement will be structured in a&#13;
phased manner to minimize the financial risks for the borrower. This is feasible because of the&#13;
divisible nature of the project. Periodic reviews of the financial viability of the project components&#13;
and of Azerigaz will be undertaken in close concert with procurement reviews, to ensure that the&#13;
individual project subcomponents remain feasible, and the procurement plan will be adjusted&#13;
accordingly. Annex 4.3 shows the procurement plan for the project.&#13;
4.13  All contracts for goods procured under ICB, LIB and IS will be subject to IDA's prior review&#13;
procedure. The terms of reference for all consulting assignments will be subject to prior review by&#13;
IDA. All consulting contracts in excess of US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals will&#13;
be subject to IDA's prior review procedure. This relatively extensive review of the procurement&#13;
packages is considered necessary because of the inexperience of Azerigaz. In addition to IDA's&#13;
review procedure, a procurement specialist, contracted under the implementation assistance&#13;
component of the Project, would assist Azerigaz to implement the procurement according to IDA's&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
D.   Disbursement&#13;
4.14  The profile of yearly expenditures for the IDA Credit is given in Table 4.2. The distribution&#13;
over the implementation period (spread over five Bank fiscal years) is uneven, with 11 percent to&#13;
be disbursed in fiscal year 1997, 29 percent in 1998, 33 percent in 1999, 21 percent in 2000 and 6&#13;
percent in 2001. This distribution is consistent with the borrowers' ability to implement the project&#13;
and is based on the preparation work done on the terms of reference for implementation assistance&#13;
and technical specifications. In the first year, the disbursements will be for consultants to assist in&#13;
project implementation and launching the first procurement package for metering (CGS). In the&#13;
second, third and fourth years, the engineered materials, equipment and remaining TA would be&#13;
disbursed.&#13;
4.15  Disbursements will be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for goods and&#13;
consultants' services up to US$50,000 equivalent for which detailed documents evidencing&#13;
expenditures will be reviewed and kept by Azerigaz and made available for the required audit as well&#13;
as to Bank supervision missions. Disbursements against contracts for goods and consultants' services&#13;
exceeding US$50,000 equivalent will be made against normal documentation.&#13;

4.16  To facilitate payments of small and medium size amounts in foreign currency and all&#13;
payments in local currency, the Borrower will open a separate Special Account (SA) in a commercial&#13;
bank acceptable to IDA. The maximum authorized allocation of the SA will be US$200,000. The&#13;
initial amount to be deposited at the beginning of disbursement will be US$100,000. This amount&#13;
will be increased to the maximum authorized allocation once the level of disbursement under the&#13;
Credit reaches US$1,000,000 equivalent. Each disbursement from this account will require&#13;
documentation from the Project Manager at Azerigaz to ensure that it is being used exclusively for&#13;
eligible expenditures. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months,&#13;
and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;

E.    Supervision&#13;
4.18  Owing to the nature of the project, the relative lack of experience on Bank projects in&#13;
Azerbaijan and Azerigaz's lack of experience with Bank procedures, reporting arrangements are&#13;
particularly important. Frequent adjustment of the work program is expected, in order to compensate&#13;
for changing conditions during project implementation. To facilitate increased focus on the project&#13;
objectives during implementation, a set of key development and performance monitoring indicators&#13;
have been developed that will be specifically addressed in supervision missions and periodic reports&#13;
by the borrower (Annex 4.4).&#13;
4.19  A project launch mission will take place early on to accelerate Credit effectiveness and&#13;
project implementation. It is proposed that Azerigaz prepare monthly progress reports during the&#13;
first year of implementation, and bi-monthly progress reports thereafter. These reports will be&#13;
furnished to IDA and will present the physical progress of the project, procurement status, costs&#13;
incurred and anticipated, disbursements made, administrative aspects and institutional performance.&#13;
A mid-term review will take place towards the end of the second year and Azerigaz will be required&#13;
to prepare a report describing the physical progress and an assessment of how well the project meets&#13;
the overall project objectives and benefits.&#13;
4.20  Because of the borrower's inexperience and the fact that the project is broken into a number&#13;
of components, project supervision will require more resources than normal Bank projects. Project&#13;
supervision will entail two supervision missions annually. Requirements in terms of staff weeks are&#13;
expected to be high (24 weeks) in the first year, but should decline to 20 staff weeks in the second&#13;
year, and to 18 in the third and fourth years of the project. Annex 4.5 details the proposed&#13;
supervision program.&#13;
4.21 During the implementation phase of the project, Azerigaz will be asked to agree to furnish&#13;
the following financial reports to IDA: (a) financial statements, within three and one-half months&#13;
of the end of each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1996; (b) audited project accounts,&#13;
beginning with the account for year 1996, within six months of the end of each year; and (c) audited&#13;
financial statements within six months of the end of each year, beginning with&#13;
fiscal year 1996. Azerigaz will also prepare and furnish to IDA, within six months of&#13;
project completion, a completion report including a reassessment of proiect costs and benefits.&#13;
F.    Insurance&#13;
4.22  Insurance on equipment procured under the project will be provided during shipment under&#13;
terms of the purchase contract. Azerigaz is obliged to maintain insurance on all of its assets, and&#13;
once installed, the new equipment will be covered in the same fashion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. FINANCIAL ISSUES&#13;
A.    Financial Rates of Return&#13;
5.1   Projected financial returns on the project are fully satisfactory. The overall financial internal&#13;
rate of return (FIRR), at currently prevailing prices for inputs and outputs, is 51.6 percent after tax.&#13;
Returns on the main subcomponents are: 46.3 percent for the asset preservation components of the&#13;
project (cathodic protection, leak detection equipment, and analytical equipment and models); 33.6&#13;
percent for new meters for large industrial and commercial customers; 70.9 percent for replacement&#13;
meters; and 108.9 percent for the upgrading of instrumentation at the city gate stations.&#13;
5.2    Details of the financial rate of return analysis are contained in Annex 5.1. The level and&#13;
timing of capital costs is based on the cost estimate and implementation schedule outlined in&#13;
Sections 3 and 4. Financial benefits associated with the asset preservation components of the project&#13;
derive mainly from the gradual extension in the life of the pipe network and the consequent&#13;
reduction in annual pipe replacement costs. Average annual requirements for pipe replacement were&#13;
assumed to be 5 percent without the project (20 year life). With the implementation of cathodic&#13;
protection, they are assumed to decline from 5 percent to 3 percent per annum over the first 5 years&#13;
and to 2.5 percent per annum by the end of 15 years.19 Financial benefits also accrue through&#13;
reduced gas leakages within the area where the project is being implemented, as a result of both&#13;
cathodic protection and acquisition of leak detection equipment, and from savings in electricity&#13;
consumption as compared with the existing, poorly isolated cathodic protection system.&#13;
5.3    Positive financial returs from the installation of new and replacement meters at large&#13;
industrial and commercial customers accrue primarily from reductions in non-technical losses.&#13;
Approximately 10 percent of existing meters are not functioning at all, and the remainder are judged&#13;
to be under-reading by between 8 and 15 percent. Customers which currently have no meters are&#13;
billed based on estimated consumption "norms" associated with the types of equipment installed.&#13;
Together, these factors lead to system-wide non-technical losses of approximately 10 percent per&#13;
year. These losses are expected to be virtually eliminated where new/replacement meters are&#13;
installed. Conservatively, the loss reduction associated with replacement meters has been taken at&#13;
8 percent of sales, while the loss reduction associated with new meters has been assumed at 10&#13;
percent of sales. This latter figure almost certainly understates the likely degree of loss reduction,&#13;
since unmetered industrial customers are likely to account for higher than "average" losses -&#13;
particularly since the high norms for residential consumption may, in many cases, exceed actual&#13;
consumption (which would imply greater use in industry than estimated by Azerigaz). The&#13;
"recaptured" sales have been valued at the current industrial/commercial selling price of 240,000&#13;
manats/MCM (US$53.33/MCM). These gains will be offset, however, to the extent that customers&#13;
are willing or able to respond to higher gas bills by using gas more efficiently. The same&#13;
conservation impacts were assumed in both the financial and economic analyses: that is, 15 percent&#13;
for unmetered industrial customers and 3 percent for customers receiving replacement meters.&#13;
Azerigaz will lose the revenue which would have been associated with the sale of this gas (valued&#13;
as above), and, since their distribution costs are largely fixed, will save only the cost of purchasing&#13;
19    With cathodic protection, pipe life should increase to between 40 and 60 years. However, because of the&#13;
relatively poor state of existing pipes, full realization of these benefits is assumed to be deferred.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
the gas from the supplier. This cost has been assumed, at the margin, to be equivalent to imports&#13;
from Turkmenistan and valued at the current price of approximately US$43.00/MCM.20&#13;
5.4    Financial returns from the upgrading of the city gate metering stations were valued on the&#13;
samne basis. A more conservative estimate of the reduction in non-technical losses was used, since&#13;
the meters are more distant from the end-users and it will therefore be more difficult to track down&#13;
instances of under-billing. It was therefore assumed that improved city-gate metering will , where&#13;
installed, lead to a reduction in non-technical losses from 10 percent to 8 percent. As with customer&#13;
metering, some of this gain will be offset by customer efforts to use gas more efficiently. Customers&#13;
were assumed to respond to higher gas bills by reducing their consumption by 1.5 percent. The&#13;
recapture of non-technical losses was valued at the system weighted average selling price of&#13;
$23.16/MCM. Reductions in sales due to induced efficiency gains were valued at the difference&#13;
between the average selling price and the marginal cost of imports.&#13;
B.    Financial Risks and Sensitivities&#13;
5.5    The primary risks which might affect the financial rates of return on the project relate to: (a)&#13;
failure to actually capture the full potential benefits; (b) failure by Azerigaz to implement the project&#13;
in a timely manner; and (c) unexpectedly high capital costs of the procured equipment. These risks,&#13;
and their potential impacts on the project's rate of return, are discussed below.&#13;
5.6    A variety of technical and institutional factors may jeopardize the ability to capture potential&#13;
financial benefits of the project. As regards the asset preservation components, the existing pipeline&#13;
may be in worse condition than expected and hence expected savings in replacement costs may not&#13;
materialize as early as expected. As regards metering, the benefits associated with projected&#13;
reductions in unbilled consumption are based on system average figures for non-technical losses;&#13;
however, actual reductions will depend on the specific loss characteristics of customers who receive&#13;
the new meters, which may be less than expected. In the case of city-gate instrumentation,&#13;
reductions in losses would be jeopardized if Azerigaz fails to follow up on and eliminate residual&#13;
unbilled consumption. In addition, the estimates of financial return assume that, at the margin, the&#13;
value of gas saved is equivalent to the price of imports from Turkmenistan. If the decision not to&#13;
import gas in 1995/96 is extended indefinitely, and if there are no further increases in the price paid&#13;
to SOCAR, then the value of gas saved will, at the margin, be equal to the current price of domestic&#13;
gas - that is, US$10.80/MCM rather US$43.00. However, an indefinite ban on imports is neither&#13;
expected nor recommended.&#13;
5.7    The impacts of lowered benefits on the project FIRR's have been quantified under a&#13;
relatively pessimistic set of assumptions. Delays in realizing the benefits of investments in asset&#13;
preservation do not seriously alter the financial viability of this component. Even if no reductions&#13;
in pipe replacement were realized until 5 years after the project was completed, the FIRR would&#13;
remain high at 27.5 percent. In terms of metering, however, the viability of new industrial meters&#13;
20     While the price of domestic gas supply is currently less than that of imported gas, imports will be needed&#13;
for some years to balance supply and demand. In addition, while new offshore petroleum developments should&#13;
increase the longer-term supply of domestic gas, financial prices for this gas are expected to rise to at least at fuel-&#13;
oil parity (currently $45/MCM equivalent) in order to ensure economic allocation and efficient use of fuel&#13;
resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
could be jeopardized if benefits fail to meet expectations. A 50 percent drop in the recapture of&#13;
unbilled consumption would reduce the FIRR to 10.3 percent on new meters21. For replacement&#13;
meters and instrumentation of the city gate stations, however, a 50 percent drop in recapture would&#13;
reduce the FIRR's to a still robust 35.6 percent and 73.9 percent respectively. In the event that the&#13;
ban on irnports of gas is maintained, and that the price of domestic gas stays at $10.80/MCM, returns&#13;
decline on all components of the project. Returns would be negative on new meters, and would&#13;
decline to 60.1 percent on replacement meters and to 64.1 percent on city gate instrumentation.&#13;
Returns on asset preservation components would fall marginally to 44.7 percent, and the overall rate&#13;
of return on the project would drop to 39.6 percent. However, the lower level of gas supplies&#13;
resulting from the absence of imports would allow some scaling back of project investments.&#13;
5.8    As regards the risks associated with the capabilities of the implementing agency and&#13;
associated potential delays in project implementation, a 2-year delay in the realization of benefits&#13;
as a result of delays in equipment installation would reduce the FIRR on the project from 51.6&#13;
percent to 33.3 percent. Finally, as regards capital cost related risks, a 35 percent increase in the&#13;
estimated capital costs (an extreme scenario which would include VAT being applied on all&#13;
components and full absorption of the physical contingencies) reduces the expected FIRR to 42.0&#13;
percent.&#13;
5.9    While the project is financially robust even under a pessimistic set of assumptions, the&#13;
sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of three main factors: (a) careful planning of the&#13;
metering program, giving priority to installing meters where there are strong reasons to believe that&#13;
current billings under-represent actual consumption; (b) institutional strengthening of Azerigaz to&#13;
maximize recapture of unbilledgas use; and (c) planning and support for the overall implementation&#13;
program to ensure that the availability and capacity of local resources (both physical and financial)&#13;
are sufficient to ensure that equipment is installed in a timely manner. These factors are addressed&#13;
in the project design through early work on the preparation of tender documents for the PEMS&#13;
consultant to ensure that assistance is in place at the earliest stages of project implementation, and&#13;
through a policy agenda which focuses on the corporatization and financial viability of Azerigaz.&#13;
C.    Pro-Forma Financial Projections&#13;
5.10  Price reform is an integral factor inthe success of the project. If the status quo is naintained&#13;
with regard to pricing policies, the future financial position of Azerigaz will be precarious, and the&#13;
company will be unable to finance either the local costs of the project or the initial debt service from&#13;
internally generated funds. Pro-forma financial projections indicate that, with or without the&#13;
proposed project, Azerigaz will have a funding shortfall of approximately US$70 million over each&#13;
of the-next 3 years - of which approximately $40 million per year is attributable to priority and/or&#13;
committed investments in network rehabilitation. A substantial portion of these investments are for&#13;
pipe replacement (approximately $35.5 million per year is estimated as necessary based on an&#13;
average pipe life of 20 years). Other planned investments include purchase and installation of&#13;
residential meters, and purchase of replacement compressors for the gas storage facility at Kalmas.&#13;
21    This assumes no corresponding decline in the conservation impacts of new meters. If conservation impacts&#13;
also fill by 50 percent (to 7.5 percent), the FIRR would be 20.0 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
Even if these investments are deferred, the enterprise will still be in an annual cash deficit position&#13;
of approximately US$30 million.&#13;
5.11  In this context, price increases are regarded as essential to preserve the company's financial&#13;
viability. The average margin of $4.00/MCM equivalent agreed as a condition of Board presentation&#13;
(pam 2.15) would reduce the cash deficit by approximately US$34 million per year over the next&#13;
four years (1996-1999 average), which would provide full coverage of operating costs and of local&#13;
costs of the project, and provide partial financing (on average approxinately $8 million per year out&#13;
of the proposed $40 million) for non-project related capital investments. Table 5.1 shows the&#13;
projections of cash flow and selected performance ratios assuming that margins are increased to&#13;
$4.00/MCM equivalent in 1996 and held at that level in real terms thereafter. A more complete set&#13;
of pro forma financial statements is provided in Annex 5.2.&#13;
5.12 The remaining financing gap, however, will have to be met by additional price increases for&#13;
residential and communal customers, improved operating efficiency and/or further deferral of other&#13;
investments in the network. Azerigaz will prepare, by the first of November for each year, financial&#13;
projections and an action plan acceptable to IDA which demonstrates how they propose to meet their&#13;
finacial obligations under the project, including coverage of operating costs, contributions to&#13;
project-related expenditures, debt service coverage, financing of other capital expenditures, and&#13;
adequate return on investment. Possible measures in the action plan include but are not limited to&#13;
price increases, rescheduling of capital investment, and improvements in operating efficiency. In&#13;
addition, to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet the financial requirements of the&#13;
proposed project, Azerigaz will submit its annual capital investment program to IDA for prior&#13;
review and approval.&#13;
5.13 Over the longer term, Azerigaz is expected to operate on a commercially viable basis, and&#13;
earn a reasonable rate of return for its owners. To this end, Azerigaz and the Government have&#13;
agreed to meet the following financial conditions:&#13;
-      to implement a time-bound Action Plan to address arrears in the gas distribution sector.&#13;
The plan specifies dates, after which Azerigaz will be required to refuse further supply to&#13;
customers in the absence of prepayment or Letter of Credit, and includes provision that if the&#13;
Government exempts certain agencies from prepayment, the Government will guarantee&#13;
timely payment on their behalf;&#13;
by June 30, 1997, to improve monthly collection rates from customers to equal seventy-five&#13;
(75) percent of the invoice value of gas delivered, and by December 31, 1997 to equal ninety&#13;
(90) percent of the value of gas delivered, and to maintain collection rates at or above that&#13;
level thereafter;&#13;
not to incur additional debt unless projections indicate that a debt-service coverage ratio of&#13;
at least 1.5 can be maintained; and&#13;
following completion of the project (i.e. from 2001 onwards), to earn an annual return&#13;
equivalent to 10 percent of net revalued fixed assets.&#13;

D.    Sensitivity of Pro Forma Projections&#13;
5.14 Because the above cash flow projections are based on a fixed minimum margin per unit of&#13;
gas delivered, operating revenues are directly related to volumes sold. In the event that gas imports&#13;
are not resumed, Azerigaz will be obliged to meet their fixed operating costs, as well as the costs&#13;
associated with the project, out of a potentially smaller revenue base. An alternative scenario was&#13;
therefore examined based on the following assunption set: (a) gas imports are not resumed; (b) gas&#13;
supply from domestic fields declines in line with the projections shown in Table 2.1; (c) supply&#13;
shortfalls are spread over all customer classes in proportion to their demand; (d) prices to consumers&#13;
would be held constant in real terms, apart from the doubling of residential prices agreed prior to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Credit negotiations; and (e) a minimum $4.00/MCM (1996 price levels) average margin would be&#13;
maintained.&#13;

5.15   The resultant pro forma financial projections are summarized in Table 5.2, and detailed in&#13;
Annex 5.3. Table 5.2 demonstrates that, at least in the short term, Azerigaz is in a moderately better&#13;
financial position as a result of continued curtailment of imports, provided that current purchase and&#13;
selling prices are maintained in real terms, and that the curtailment in supply is spread&#13;
proportionately across all customer classes. If, however, as a result of political or social&#13;
considerations, curtailments are focussed on industrial customers in order to maintain supply to&#13;
residential and communal customers, there would be a rapid deterioration in Azerigaz's average&#13;
margin at current prices. Furthermore, unless domestic production could be maintained at or near&#13;
current levels, the curtailment of imports would entail as much as a 50 percent drop in Azerigaz's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
sales, and the company would be unable to cover its full operating costs eyen with a $4.00/MCM&#13;
average margin.&#13;
E.    Accounting and Auditing Arrangements&#13;
5.16 Virtually all of Azerigaz's financial and accounting activities are carried out manually.&#13;
Billings, accounts receivable, payments and fixed asset management are handled regionally.&#13;
Financial results, in terms of profits and balance sheets, are reported quarterly to head office where&#13;
they are "consolidated" (i.e. added together without adjustment) to generate corporate financial&#13;
statements. "Surplus" cash from the regions (i.e. the difference between their collections and their&#13;
expenses) is also transferred to head office. Internal financial controls are weak, in part because of&#13;
the poor information on gas flows to and within the regions, but also because of the substantial&#13;
autonomy allowed at the local level. While annual audits are carried out on both regional and central&#13;
financial records, these are conducted by the taxation department and are focussed primarily on&#13;
assessing tax liability and compliance. A corporate audit based on International Auditing Standards&#13;
([AS) would be problematic at this stage. Accounting systems are not fully in accord with&#13;
intemational accounting standards,' local accounting finns are not qualified to undertake a full audit&#13;
in accordance with international standards, and the cost of retaining an international firm to&#13;
undertake such an audit would be prohibitive at the present time given the poor state of the&#13;
company's finances, and of the economy as a whole.&#13;
5.17 Bank requirements for the maintenance and auditing of project accounts have been discussed&#13;
with senior management, who have agreed to comply with Bank standards in terms of record-&#13;
keeping and reporting. Theconmpany has agreed to appoint an independent auditor, acceptable to&#13;
IDA, to review project accounts, SA's and SOE's on an annual basis. In addition, in order to assist&#13;
Azerigaz in developing their own accounting capabilities, a substantial proportion of both the office&#13;
equipment and training budgets under the project will be directed towards the financial departments.&#13;
For the corporate accounts, it is proposed that the requirement for a full LAS audit be introduced&#13;
once the corporation has had an opportunity to upgrade and strengthen its accounting and financial&#13;
mnanagement systems. Beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, Azerigaz will be&#13;
asked to engage international auditors, under terms of engagement satisfactory to IDA, to review&#13;
corporate financial statements, and to assess internal recording and control procedures.&#13;
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    Benefits, Costs and Rate of Return&#13;
6.1    The proposed project consists primarily of investments which constitute a part of a longer-&#13;
term program to upgrade, rehabilitate and preserve the gas transmission and distribution network.&#13;
22    Inconsistencies with international accounting standards include the following: (i) income and expenditure&#13;
accounts are maintained on a cash, rather than an accrual basis; (ii) reserves for uncollectible accounts are&#13;
prohibited; (iii) write-off of bad debts and obsolete assets and inventories requires prior government approval; (iv)&#13;
revaluation of assets is based on general indexes dictated by the government; and (v) consolidated accounts do not&#13;
include adjustments for internal transactions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Least-cost principles have been adhered to in the selection of technologies, the choices between&#13;
replacement and upgrading, and the specifications of materials quality.&#13;
6.2   The principal economic benefits of the project, which have been used to assess the Economic&#13;
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR), are as follows:&#13;
-     reduced expenditure on pipeline replacement due to rehabilitation of the cathodic&#13;
protection system;&#13;
-     increased efficiency in the use of gas due to the incentives created by the introduction&#13;
of effective metering; and&#13;
-     reduction in gas leakage due to replacement of corroded or damaged pipe.&#13;
6.3   The economic costs of the project have been assessed at the same level as the financial costs&#13;
(excluding taxes and duties), since the bulk of the costs are for imported equipment procured on&#13;
international markets. The value of the benefits for pipelines is the cost of replacement at&#13;
international parity prices. Gas savings have been valued at the economic value of gas, which has&#13;
been taken at fuel oil export parity, or US$45.00/MCM based on a fuel oil export price of US$50/ton&#13;
(f.o.b. Baku).&#13;
6.4  In the short run, given the volume of required gas imports, it could be argued that the cost&#13;
of gas imports would be a more appropriate measure of the economic value of gas. However, this&#13;
has not been used for two_easons: firstly, it is extremely difficult to arrive at a realistic economic&#13;
(as opposed to financial) value of imports of gas (especially those from Turkmenistan), due to the&#13;
distorted nature of the FSU gas market and the lack of adequate data; and, secondly, in the medium&#13;
term, as Azerbaijan's gas production stabilizes and eventually recovers, it will be possible to supply&#13;
all of the "non-substitutable" gas market from domestic gas, leaving gas to displace fuel oil at the&#13;
nargin in the power market. The project will save a total of about 215 million cubic meters of gas&#13;
per year (3% of consumption) within five years of completion through improved efficiency of use&#13;
and reduced leakage. The annual economic value of this gas is about US$10 million.&#13;
6.5   Based upon these assessments the EIRR for the project as a whole is fully satisfactory (46.9&#13;
percent). The EIRR's for the individual components are presented below (additional detail is&#13;
provided in Annex 6.1):&#13;
-     Asset Preservation: 53.4 percent, based upon extension of the lifetime of the pipeline&#13;
assets and consequent reduction in annual maintenance cost, reduced gas leakages,&#13;
and reduced electricity costs.&#13;
-     New Gas Meters: 43.0 percent, based upon an assumption of an improvement in&#13;
efficiency of use of gas of 15 percent after 3 years. This is a fairly conservative&#13;
figure, since it is often observed that metering can lead to irnprovements in efficiency&#13;
of 25 percent or more.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
lacement Gas Meters: 21.1 percent, based upon an assumption that there will be&#13;
a 3.0 percent improvement in gas use efficiency since, firstly, current meters are&#13;
estimated to under-read consumption by about 10 percent, and secondly, about 10&#13;
percent of meters are not working. In the first case there will be a demand response&#13;
to the increase in billed gas, in the second there will be a substantial response as&#13;
metering is restored and consumption is rationalized.&#13;
UUpgrading of Metering at City Gate Stations: 74.3 percent, based upon an&#13;
assumption that there will be a 1.5 percent improvement in gas use efficiency due to&#13;
the elimination of large scale gas theft in certain areas, which in turn will lead to a&#13;
rationalization of gas use. In addition, there will be some benefit in reduced gas&#13;
leakage since accurate metering at key points in the system will allow losses through&#13;
leakage to be identified more rapidly.&#13;
6.6   The main economic risks faced by the project arise from:&#13;
-     possible over-estimation of the demand response to improvements in the metering&#13;
system;&#13;
-     possible over-estimation of the benefits from cathodic protection (due to the existing&#13;
pipeline being in poorer condition than assumed);&#13;
-     lower benefits from  gas savings due to lower international oil prices and&#13;
consequently lower economic value of natural gas saved; and&#13;
-     higher capital costs than expected.&#13;
6.7   The outcomes of key sensitivities taking account of these risks are shown in Table 6.1. It can&#13;
be seen that all of the components are robust to downside assumptions, and that the project as a&#13;
whole is robust to both lower energy prices and substantially higher capital costs.&#13;

6.8    The only exception to economic robustness is the Replacement Metering component, which&#13;
yields 10.4 percent when a 50 percent lower efficiency response is assumed. While this may be&#13;
unacceptable on a stand-alone basis, it should be noted that the upgrading of all meters may well be&#13;
necessary in order to create the appropriate climate of accurate and equitable metering that will lead&#13;
to improved gas use measurement and revenue collection. If only new meters and the most obsolete&#13;
and inaccurate existing meters were replaced, this would create two classes of customer - those with&#13;
"old" and less reliable Soviet-era meters, and those with new and more reliable foreign meters. There&#13;
would tend to be resistance among those with newer meters to paying for perceived under-reading&#13;
and cheating by "old" meter customers.&#13;
B.    Risk Analysis and Risk Mitigation Measures&#13;
6.9    There are a number of risks attached to undertaking the proposed project, both at the&#13;
macroeconomic level and at the project level. The financial and economic sensitivity analyses have&#13;
examined several of the project risks, with a view to testing the robustness of the predicted rates of&#13;
retum. While the sensitivity analyses have indicated that the project remains economically and&#13;
financially viable under a wide range of assumptions, the degree of uncertainty regarding returns can&#13;
be reduced by anticipating the risks and incorporating mitigation measures into the project design.&#13;
6.10   The key project risks can be summarized under the following headings:&#13;
*      Government policy risks, in terms of failure to enact the necessary reforns and/or&#13;
failure to take steps necessary to ensure the viability of the gas enterprises;&#13;
*      risks related to the capital and operating costs of the project;&#13;
*      risks related to the borrower's implementation capability;&#13;
*      risks regarding the timely availability of counterpart funding, to meet both local costs&#13;
of the project and debt service obligations;&#13;
*      risks that loss reduction will fall below targets; and&#13;
*      risks that energy conservation impacts will be less than predicted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
6.11   Macroeconomic risks include:&#13;
*     continuing arrears problems throughout the economy, which jeopardize the financial&#13;
viability of the gas company, its suppliers, and its customers;&#13;
*     further contraction/stagnation of the industrial and commercial sectors, and&#13;
consequent loss of relevance of part of the metering program;&#13;
*     failure or delay of macroeconomic stabilization programs, with consequent high&#13;
domestic inflation and deterioration in the exchange rate.&#13;
6.12 The project has been designed to minimize the potential impact of these risks in a number&#13;
of ways. Risks of Government failure to enact required reforms are being dealt with by requiring&#13;
specific actions to be taken prior to negotiations, Board presentation and Credit effectiveness, and&#13;
by having critical items (pricing, corporatization) addressed prior to Board presentation. In addition,&#13;
ongoing dialogue will be maintained with regard to the long term development of the gas sector.&#13;
At present, the gas sector is at the center of political focus due to the problems of gas supply and the&#13;
central role which the fuel plays in the economy. Hence it is likely that gas policy will receive&#13;
increased attention from the Government in future, and that with suitable dialogue between IDA and&#13;
the Government, necessary policies will be enacted.&#13;
6.13  Risks related to the costs and relevance of project components are being addressed through&#13;
a combination of detailed survey work prior to initial procurement, provision of substantial expert&#13;
assistance to the PIU, and a mid-term review at approximately the mid-point of project&#13;
disbursements. Implementation risks are being addressed through technical assistance to the PIU,&#13;
as well as through on-going country-wide seminars and training on Bank procedures. In any event,&#13;
the EIRR and FIRR of the project are robust even under fairly pessimistic scenarios relating to costs&#13;
and timing. Financial risks are being addressed through pricing conditionalities, including the&#13;
requirement for initial price increases which was met prior to Credit negotiations. In addition,&#13;
financial covenants will require that actions be taken in advance to ensure that Azerigaz is able to&#13;
meet its financial obligations under the loan. The risks attached to failure to capture expected&#13;
benefits from the project are being addressed through supporting the corporatization of Azerigaz,&#13;
and providing technical assistance in support of institutional development. Again, the project is&#13;
fairly robust under more pessimistic assumptions regarding benefits capture.&#13;
6.14 The problem of arrears is being addressed at the macroeconomic level in conjunction with&#13;
discussions with the IMF, and additional provision against these risks is incorporated in the covenant&#13;
which requires implementation of a time bound Action Plan to reduce accounts receivable to more&#13;
satisfactory levels, and a covenant which requires that they be maintained at these levels over time.&#13;
The Bank continues to reinforce the need for measures to reduce arrears in its discussions with the&#13;
Government. Nonetheless, arrears remain one of the more serious risks potentially affecting the&#13;
project.&#13;

VUI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
A.   Agreements Reached&#13;
7.1   Prior to Credit negotiations the Government implemented a two-times increase in residential&#13;
gas prices, to 12,700 manats/MCM (US$2.80 equivalent) (para 2.15).&#13;
7.2   During Credit negotiations, the following agreements were reached:&#13;
a)    The Government will maintain all gas prices at not less than their current levels in real terns&#13;
and will make quarterly upward adjustments to communal and residential gas prices as&#13;
necessary so as to ensure Azerigaz an average operating margin of at least US$4.00/MCM&#13;
equivalent (in constant 1996 dollars) based on reasonable projections of gas sales and&#13;
purchases (para 2.15).&#13;
b)    The Government will establish Azerigaz as a joint stock company, by September 30, 1996&#13;
with shares held initially by the State Property Committee, under a charter which reflects the&#13;
commercial focus of the company, and also the ultimate separability of its various activities&#13;
(para 2.2 1).&#13;
c)    The Government will implement an Action Plan to address arrears in the gas distribution&#13;
sector. The Plan specifies dates after which Azerigaz would be required to refuse further&#13;
supply to Azerenerji and other revenue-earning customers in the absence of timely payments.&#13;
(para 2.25).&#13;
d)    The Government has expressed its intention, through a policy letter to IDA, to implement&#13;
the following actions (see Annex 7.1):&#13;
to undertake timely passage of gas legislation, based in part on work to be carried out&#13;
with EU-TACIS financing (para 2.21);&#13;
to establish the LPG distribution departnent of Azerigaz as a separate company, and&#13;
to privatize it in a manner which attracts significant investment from a qualified&#13;
foreign company, while maintaining competitive conditions for LPG distribution&#13;
(para 2.22);&#13;
-     to carry out a review of the producer pricing and contract system for gas which&#13;
addresses the investment needs of gas development and also the need to attract&#13;
foreign investment to gas development projects (para 2.13).&#13;
e)    The Government will prepare, by December 31, 1996, a schedule acceptable to IDA for&#13;
further increases in residential gas prices to equate them to at least the cost of gas purchases.&#13;
This schedule will be coordinated with both the introduction of residential meters and the&#13;
development of a mechanism to protect low-income households from adverse impacts of&#13;
price increases (para 2.15).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
f)    The Government agreed that a targeted mitigation program to protect low-income&#13;
households from adverse impacts of higher energy prices would be initiated in conjunction&#13;
with the proposed program of residential gas price increases (para 2.19).&#13;
g)    Azerigaz and the Government will develop, by December 31, 1996, a program to extend&#13;
metering to cover all residential customers, with priority assigned to the coverage of single-&#13;
family dwellings and apartments which use gas for multiple purposes (e.g., cooking, heating,&#13;
hot water). The program will include a timetable for completion, and a financing plan to&#13;
cover the cost of the meters and of their installation. (para 2.17).&#13;
h)    Azerigaz and the Government will meet the following financial conditions (para 5.13):&#13;
by June 30, 1997, to improve monthly collection rates from customers to equal&#13;
seventy-five (75) percent of the invoice value of gas delivered, and by December 31,&#13;
1997 to equal ninety (90) percent of the value of gas delivered, and to maintain&#13;
collection rates at or above that level thereafter;&#13;
not to incur additional debt unless projections indicate that a debt-service coverage&#13;
ratio of at least 1.5 can be maintained; and&#13;
following completion of the project (i.e. from 2001 onwards), to earn an annual&#13;
return equivalent to 10 percent of net revalued fixed assets.&#13;
i)    Azerigaz will prepare, by the first of November for each year, financial projections and an&#13;
action plan acceptable to IDA which demonstrates how they propose to meet their financial&#13;
obligations under the project, including coverage of operating costs, contributions to project-&#13;
related expenditures, debt service coverage, financing of other capital expenditures, and&#13;
adequate return on investment. Possible measures in the action plan include but are not&#13;
limited to price increases, rescheduling of capital investment, and improvements in operating&#13;
efficiency. Azerigaz will also submit its annual capital investment program to IDA for prior&#13;
review and approval (para 5.12).&#13;
j)    Azerigaz will meet the following requirements for financial reporting (para 4.21):&#13;
-     financial statements, within three and one-half months of the end of each fiscal year,&#13;
beginning with fiscal year 1996;&#13;
audited project accounts, beginning with the accounts for 1996, within six months&#13;
of the end of each year; and&#13;
audited financial statements within six months of the end of each year, beginning&#13;
with 1996.&#13;
k)    Azerigaz will appoint an independent auditor, acceptable to IDA,-to review project accounts,&#13;
SA's and SOE's on an annual basis (parm 5.17).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
1)    Azerigaz, beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, will engage intemational&#13;
auditors, under terms of engagement satisfactory to IDA, to review corporate financial&#13;
statements, and to assess internal recording and control procedures (para 5.17).&#13;
7.3   The following conditions for Credit effectiveness have been stipulated:&#13;
a)    The Government will complete a subsidiary loan agreement with Azerigaz under the terms&#13;
and conditions outlined in the financing plan (para 3.16).&#13;
b)    Azerigaz will formally establish a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and appoint&#13;
managerial, operational and support staff sufficient to initiate project implementation (pam&#13;
4.1).&#13;

AZERBAIJAN GAS SYSTEM REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
HOUSEHOLD GAS PRICE INCREASES&#13;
ASSESSMENT OF SOCIAL IMPACTS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     Significant increases in residential gas prices are required in Azerbaijan if the gas company is to&#13;
achieve financial viability. Current prices to households are a small fraction of the purchase price of gas,&#13;
even at the relatively low prices charged by SOCAR. However, given the relatively low wage levels in&#13;
the country, concern has been expressed about the affordability of household gas price increases -&#13;
particularly when increases of ten times or greater are contemplated. A special review was therefore&#13;
carried out by London Economics, together with consultants working with the Bank's Poverty&#13;
Assessment, as part of the preparation of the Gas Rehabilitation Project. The consultants examined the&#13;
affordability of various levels of gas price increases for households across the range of income levels,&#13;
and considered alternative mechanisms for protecting vulnerable low-income households from adverse&#13;
impacts of an overall increase in tariffs. This Annex describes the key findings of that review and&#13;
presents preliminary options for alleviating potential impacts on low-income households.&#13;
2.     A primary source of data for the review was the household survey carried out by the Government&#13;
of Azerbaijan and the World Bank during November and December of 1995 as part of the Bank's&#13;
Poverty Assessment work'. The primary focus of the survey was to examine living standards, incomes&#13;
and expenditures across a broad sample of households. Over 2,000 households were surveyed, including&#13;
both established households in urban and rural areas and also refugee families living in either cities or&#13;
tented camps. While the survey was not primarily directed at establishing patterns of usage or&#13;
expenditure on energy, it provided useful information which could be used to draw some representative&#13;
outlines of the role of energy in household budgets and of observed willingness to pay for energy&#13;
supplies.&#13;
Characteristics of Energy Use&#13;
3.     Because the survey was carried out during the period when gas supply was being restricted to&#13;
only a limited number of regions in the country due to a government policy of banning gas imports, only&#13;
38 percent of households reported using gas for either cooking or heating - despite the fact that at one&#13;
time network gas was available to over 80 percent of the population. Figures I and 2 below show the&#13;
breakdowns of primary fuel use based on the survey responses.&#13;
4.     One of the more notable findings on fuel use is the dominance of fuelwood. Fuelwood was&#13;
reported as the primary fuel both for cooking and heating in over 40 percent of the households surveyed.&#13;
This suggests that many households have responded to the cutting off of gas supply by using wood,&#13;
despite its high price when transport costs are included.&#13;
5.     Of the 38 percent of households which reported using gas, 20 percent said that they used gas for&#13;
cooking only, 1 percent used gas for heating only, 9 percent used gas cookers and heaters, and the&#13;
remaining 8 percent reported using their gas cookers for both cooking and as a primary source of heating.&#13;
The analysis in this paper was carried out prior to the final review of survey findings by the Poverty&#13;
Assessment team. While the survey results convey an accurate picture of reported household incomes and&#13;
expenditures, the precise definitions of some of the categories may be adjusted upon further review.&#13;

The prevalence of this latter group can be explained by the structure of the tariff, where the charge for a&#13;
gas cooker is a fixed amount per person per month (based on norms for cooking usage, as gas use in&#13;
households is not metered). Hence, while the cooker may not be an efficient source of heat, using it in&#13;
this manner carries no additional cost to the household.&#13;

the poorest in terms of total household expenditure and decile 10 the wealthiest. Gas is most widely used&#13;
by the poorest 20 percent and the richest 10 percent of the population. The distributional pattern of gas&#13;
use is in large part due to the shortage of gas and the restriction of supplies to only half the country,&#13;
including Baku, during the survey period. 94 percent of households in Baku use gas against the national&#13;
average of 38 percent; in addition, the poorest and richest households are concentrated in Baku.&#13;

Current Energy Tariffs&#13;
7.     Gas tariffs for household consumers are very low. While they have risen significantly in real&#13;
terms during 1995 - see Table 2 - increases are less than the increases in the prices of other fuels.&#13;
Current tariffs are M6350 per MCM, approximately $1.40 per MCM. Despite the increase, gas tariffs for&#13;
household consumers are far below industrial and commercial tariffs. Current tariffs for the latter&#13;
category are M240,000 per MCM, approximately $53 per MCM. Gas tariffs are uniform for each&#13;
consumer category across Azerbaijan.&#13;
8.     Household gas consumers are not metered in Azerbaijan. Bills are based on consumption norms&#13;
for appliances and household size. While these norms overestimate individual appliance consumption,&#13;
they underestimate actual household consumption due to inefficient use, wastage and non-technical&#13;
losses. The recent introduction of meters to about 700 households in Baku has shown significant&#13;
variation, both positive and negative, in actual gas consumption around that based on norms.&#13;
9.     In principle, gas bills are issued monthly, and gas inspectors visit households once a month to&#13;
verify appliance use, household size, and to service appliances and connections. In practice, bills are&#13;
issued quarterly in some districts, and many households are inspected only once a year. Bills are payable&#13;
within a month. Failure to pay on time leads to a 0.1 percent penalty in the first instance, and is followed&#13;
by disconnection if the bill remains unsettled for three months. In practice, few households pay on time,&#13;
and the sanctions available are never applied. Indeed, officials at Bakgaz, the distribution company&#13;
serving Baku, believe that current legislation does not empower them to disconnect households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Stronger legislation, however, may not help greatly as it is technically difficult to disconnect many&#13;
individual households due to the absence of service or meter valves.&#13;

Costs of Gas Use&#13;
10.    The first column of Table 3 below sets out estimated gas bills by decile. These estimates are&#13;
based on gas consumption norms, the current gas tariff for household consumers, and data on household&#13;
size and appliance use for cooking and heating from the Household Survey.2 The average cooking bill&#13;
is estimated to be some M600 per month. The average space heating and water heating bills (weighted&#13;
for alternative appliances) are estimated at M2,440 and M I, 150 per month, respectively. However, not&#13;
all gas consuming households use gas for all three services. The total gas bill could be as low as M600&#13;
for those using gas cookers alone, and as high as M4,190 for households using all three services. Using&#13;
Household Survey data on the use of gas, the average gas bill is estimated to be M l,877 per winter&#13;
month. The distribution of estimated bills across the income deciles is relatively even. In other words,&#13;
the variation in appliance use across the deciles is counter-acted by the larger family sizes of poorer&#13;
deciles.&#13;
2      The estimation assumes that 50 percent of households using gas for either cooking or heating use&#13;
gas-fired appliances for water heating. This is based on estimates by Sofregaz. Specific appliances used&#13;
for water heating are based on appliances registered with Azerigaz for the rayons receiving gas supplies.&#13;

11.    It should be noted that, because of the structure of the norms, gas bills for households with gas&#13;
heat are higher in the winter months, since the heating charge is not applied during the other seasons. In&#13;
order to provide a basis for comparison with total household expenditures and also for comparison with&#13;
the survey (which was carried out during the winter), the estimates below are based on winter month&#13;
billings. However, if heating tariffs were levellized over the year (i.e. payable, but at a lower rate, in&#13;
each month), the monthly cost of heating with gas would be significantly lower than is implied in the&#13;

12.    At present, many consumers are eligible for discounts, ranging between 10 percent and 100&#13;
percent, on their gas bills. Table 4 below sets out the consumer categories and the discount available.&#13;
Consumers claiming these concessions are asked to submit documents to verify their claims. There&#13;
appeared to be some confusion both within the gas company and among the general population over&#13;
these categories, which suggests that there is considerable leeway for interpretation. For example,&#13;
conflicting reports were received as to whether pensioners were eligible for concessions. There was also&#13;
confusion over the definition of families, and whether it comprises all members living together or only&#13;
immediate family. Furthermore, some of the categories may be inconsistent. For example, it is unclear&#13;
whether invalids of the Karabakh war are entitled to a 100 percent or 50 percent discount.&#13;
13.    These concessions cover a substantial number of consumers. Both Bakgaz and Azerigaz believe&#13;
that some 50 percent of household consumers enjoy concessions on their gas bills. Sofregaz's recent&#13;
work identified that of the 3,326 MCM supplied in September 1995 in Sabahel district:&#13;
-      35 percent was supplied free of charge;&#13;
-      8 percent was sold at a 90 percent discount;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                                           Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 6&#13;
-       8 percent was sold at a 50 percent discount; and&#13;
-       only 49 percent was charged at the full tariff.&#13;
14.     Sofregaz estimate a weighted discount to households of 53 percent arising from these&#13;
concessions. The second and third columns of Table 3 above show the sharp impact of these&#13;
concessions on gas bills. The discount offered to households with a pensioner reduces the average bill&#13;
by almost 30 percent. An effective discount to all households of 50 percent reduces the estimated bill to&#13;
M939.&#13;
15.     The cost of these exemptions and discount is borne by the State budget.  However, there are&#13;
substantial arrears in disbursements from the State Budget for these subsidies. In other words, the de&#13;
facto cost of these exemptions is borne by the gas distribution companies. It should be emphasized that&#13;
any increase in gas tariffs increases the cost of these subsidies to the State Budget.&#13;

16.     The final two columns of Table 3 show the average household expenditure quoted for heating in&#13;
the Household Survey. For households consuming gas, the quoted heating bills are not significantly out&#13;
of line with the estimated the gas bill (column 1) - except at the lower-income levels, where&#13;
concessionary tariffs may be more prevalent. In some instances, the quoted heating bills may be higher&#13;
than the estimated gas bill, since not all gas consuming households use gas for heating, and other heating&#13;
fuels are typically higher cost.&#13;

17.    Quoted heating bills for households not using gas are significantly higher at an average M20,454.&#13;
In other words, the cost of heating with fuels other than gas rapidly increases energy bills. The variation&#13;
in energy bills across income deciles is shown in Figure 3.&#13;

Costs of Other Energy&#13;
18.    Residential electricity tariffs are also heavily subsidized in Azerbaijan. The current household&#13;
tariff is MI 8 per kWh for monthly consumption under 200 kWh. Higher consumption attracts a higher&#13;
tariff - M45 per kWh up to 300 kWh and M70 thereafter. Households registered to use electricity for&#13;
cooking are allowed 300 kWh at the M 18 tariff, and M45 per kWh thereafter. The M 18 per kWh tariff is&#13;
estimated to be less than 20 percent of production cost by Azerenerji, and compares with an industrial&#13;
tariff of M184 per kWh.&#13;
19.    The average electricity bill based on an average consumption of 294 kWh would be M7,830 per&#13;
month. This is considerably higher than electricity bills quoted in the Household Survey. The average&#13;
bill quoted in the survey was M3,940, dropping to M3,300 for households that use gas. Part of the&#13;
discrepancy may be attributable to the fact that concessions similar to those afforded to gas users are also&#13;
granted to electricity consumers.&#13;
2&#13;
20.    District heat services are also heavily subsidized. In Baku, the household tariff is M81 per m&#13;
giving an average winter bill of M3,645 for a 45m  dwelling.3 As with gas, there are significant&#13;
weaknesses in the billing and collection systems, and a long list of consumer discounts for both&#13;
electricity and district heat consumers. In consequence, there are heavy arrears amongst household&#13;
3      The average size of dwelling is based on the Household Survey.&#13;
&#13;

consumers. Bakteploset, the district heating company in Baku, estimates that only 10 percent to 15&#13;
percent of households pay for the energy consumed. Similarly, cash receipts at Azerenerji amount to less&#13;
than 10 percent of billings.&#13;
21.    While electricity and gas prices for households are heavily subsidized, wood, petroleum&#13;
products, and other non-network fuels in Azerbaijan increasingly reflect market prices. The price gap&#13;
between market and subsidized fuels is significant. For example, it is estimated that households in&#13;
northern Azerbaijan may spend up to M40,000 per winter month on wood fuel. Similarly, one month's&#13;
supply of LPG for cooking can cost Ml 5,000 for a 20 kg cylinder (excluding the capital cost of the&#13;
cylinder).&#13;
22.   The imbalance of relative prices ensures that network fuels are the preferred energy source, if&#13;
available. The cheapest heating fuel is natural gas, followed by district heat, and electricity.4 The&#13;
differential access to network fuels under the Government's policy of banning gas imports suggests that&#13;
distorted relative prices for energy products are giving rise to significant income re-distribution between&#13;
Baku and households outside Baku. This is strongly corroborated by the Household Survey. Average&#13;
heating bills for households using gas are only 11 percent of bills for all households.&#13;
Household Income and Expenditure - Survey Results&#13;
23.    Household expenditure in Azerbaijan for all households and gas consuming households are&#13;
shown in Table 5. Average consumption for all households is just under $200 per month. Food&#13;
comprises over half of total consumption for all households, and bread is the most important food&#13;
product consumed.&#13;
24.    Expenditures of gas consuming households are broadly similar to those of average households,&#13;
except that:&#13;
-      heating bills for gas consuming households are a fraction of the national average;&#13;
-      gas consuming households have much higher housing costs; and&#13;
-      gas consuming households consume less food, mainly due to lower household production.&#13;
These observations hold across all income deciles, and in large part reflect the urban location of gas&#13;
consuming households.&#13;
4      This ranking is partially re-enforced by the capital cost of switching from gas to electricity -&#13;
electricity heaters in Baku retail for between US $20 (M90,000) and $100 (M450,000).&#13;

26.   The reported average household incomes for all households and for gas consuming households&#13;
are shown in Table 6. Average household income is well over $50 per month including salaries and&#13;
allowances but only a quarter of the expenditures reported. The average value of the first salary is&#13;
roughly in line with the national averages produced by Goskomstat. Again, there are significant&#13;
differences between gas consuming households and the national average:&#13;
gas consuming households have a higher income;&#13;
gas consuming households earn higher salaries and receive somewhat higher transfers and&#13;
allowances; and&#13;
gas consuming households earn far less from the sale of agricultural produce than the average.&#13;

across expenditure deciles is shown in Figure 5.&#13;

28.   While the three- to four-fold discrepancy between reported incomes and expenditures is&#13;
significant, it is typical in household surveys to find that incomes are under-reported while expenditures&#13;
are over-reported. In additionr,the-inclusion of non-cash expenditures such as imputed rent and the value&#13;
of own production in the expenditure figures, without also including them in income, distorts the&#13;
normally-expected balance between the two. This discrepancy is not viewed as discrediting the survey&#13;
findings, although it can create some problems in establishing a reliable basis for assessing the impacts&#13;
of price increases on household budgets. The Poverty Assessment team is currently reviewing the survey&#13;
data with a view to developing an agreed measure of income/expenditure which will give a reasonable&#13;
basis for evaluating the well-being of the population. Once this work is completed, the assessment of the&#13;
affordability of household gas price increases will be reviewed. One noteworthy observation which can&#13;
be made by comparing Figures 4 and 5 is that the discrepancy between reported expenditures and&#13;
incomes is less in the lower expenditure deciles (less than 2 times) that in the highest deciles&#13;
(approximately 4 times), particularly for gas consuming households. Hence, the problem of selecting a&#13;
base for affordability assessments is of less concern at these income levels.&#13;
Impacts of Higher Gas Tariffs&#13;
29.    Figure 6 shows current household expenditure on gas as a proportion of household income across&#13;
all deciles. In order to err on the side of caution, income for gas consuming households rather than&#13;
expenditure has been used as the comparator for gas bills. In addition, current discounts were excluded&#13;
from the estimates, and bills were based on the higher tariffs applicable during the winter months. The&#13;
Figure shows the proportion of income which would be spent on gas consumption at three different tariff&#13;
levels:&#13;
at current tariffs;&#13;
following a three-fold increase in tariffs, assuming no reduction in gas consumption; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 12&#13;
-      following a ten-fold increase in gas tariffs over current levels. A ten-fold increase, together with&#13;
a 50 percent increase in communal tariffs, would be sufficient to provide an average margin of&#13;
US$4.00 per MCM on projected 1996 gas sales.5&#13;
The figure also shows the heating bills reported by all households across Azerbaijan for comparison.&#13;
This can be roughly interpreted as the revealed ability of households to pay for energy.&#13;
30.    At current tariff levels, household expenditure on gas is around I percent of income for the&#13;
poorest households. A three-fold increase in tariffs would raise average gas spending to around 3 percent&#13;
for the poorest deciles. Nevertheless, this remains generally below the expenditure on heat reported by&#13;
all consumers in the Household Survey. Furthernore, even at the three-fold tariff, expenditure on gas&#13;
would be smaller than that on alcohol and cigarettes and most other expenditure items in the household&#13;
budget.&#13;

31.    A I 0-fold increase in tariffs, however, would be more problematic, at least at the lower income&#13;
levels. Following such a tariff increase, expenditure on gas during the winter months would be pushed&#13;
over IO percent of income for the poorest 30 percent of households. For the poorest 50 percent of gas&#13;
consumers, this would be bigher than their counterparts are currently spending on alternative energy&#13;
sources. For the poorest 30 percent, expenditure on gas would come second only to food, and would in&#13;
all likelihood necessitate cuts in non-luxury consumption.&#13;
32.    Consequently, a ten-fold increase in gas tariffs is likely to require compensatory measures in&#13;
order to protect low-income households. A number of options are available, some of which are&#13;
discussed in the following section.&#13;
s      The S4.00/MCM margins is viewed as necessary to provide Azerigaz with an acceptable net income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 13&#13;
Mitigation Options to Protect the Poor&#13;
33.   The key factors which need to be considered in assessing alternative mechanisms for protecting&#13;
low income households from impacts of higher energy prices include: (i) the overall cost of the program,&#13;
which in turn relates to the degree to which support can be targeted specifically to those households&#13;
where it is most needed; and (ii) the availability of an effective delivery mechanism.&#13;
34.   At present, gas consumers enjoy protection against the full cost of gas supply through three&#13;
channels:&#13;
-      a subsidized price available to all household consumers, financed by higher tariffs for industrial&#13;
and commercial consumers and by financial losses for the gas company;&#13;
-      exemptions and exclusions for specific categories of consumers, financed by the State budget;&#13;
and&#13;
-      a notional energy allowance bundled with the bread compensation scheme to all non working&#13;
pensioners, children of poor families, students and refugees. The bread compensation scheme&#13;
covers almost 50 percent of the population, and is financed by the State budget.&#13;
35.   Raising household gas prices in the first instance will reduce the direct tariff subsidy, which is&#13;
currently borne by non-residential gas users and by the financial losses of the gas company. However,&#13;
there will continue to be a substantial degree of cross-subsidy which benefits all household consumers in&#13;
direct proportion to the amount of gas which they use. Since the volumes of gas consumed are not&#13;
significantly different among expenditure deciles (Table 3), this cross subsidy affords benefits to&#13;
households at above-average income levels as well as to the poorer households.&#13;
36.    Higher household gas prices will also increase the burden on the State Budget arising from tariff&#13;
exemptions. Assuming that concessionary tariffs are equivalent to 50 percent of household gas charges,&#13;
the subsidy at current prices amounts to approximately $1.9 million per year. Increases in gas tariffs&#13;
would lead to a proportionate increase in this subsidy burden. The increasing burden on the budget&#13;
cannot be lightly dismissed. Indeed, it is suggested that these exemptions be eliminated for the following&#13;
reasons:&#13;
-      there is little evidence to suggest that exemptions are well-targeted to protect vulnerable groups;&#13;
-     the financing burden of these subsidies is confused as fiscal pressures have led to substantial&#13;
arrears from the State Budget to the gas companies; and&#13;
-     the exemptions complicate the social safety net provision.&#13;
In short, these resources would be better allocated through the general safety net on a means tested or&#13;
targeted basis.&#13;
37.    Targeted options to protect the poor from an increase in gas tariffs can be either internal to the&#13;
gas tariff and billing system or part of the general social safety net. As an example of options which are&#13;
internal to the gas tariff system, careful refinement of the system of norms, pending the introduction of&#13;
metering, could reduce gas bills for the poorest while allowing overall increases in household gas tariffs.&#13;
At present gas bills are based on the size of household, and the appliances used. Data from the&#13;
Household Survey indicates that poorer groups have larger households, and use cookers for both heating&#13;
as well as for cooking. Hence, for example, a social gas tariff could:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 14&#13;
-      place an upper limit on household size of 4 for the purpose of calculating bills; and&#13;
-      reduce consumption norms to, say, 5 m3 per month (from the current 20 mi3) per person for&#13;
cooking with gas.&#13;
38.   The impact of such a tariff policy is illustrated in Figure 7. Gas bills as a proportion of&#13;
household income would fall to just over 7 percent (from around 10 percent under the ten-fold tariff&#13;
increase proposal) for poorer households. Whilst such a tariff structure would benefit all households, it&#13;
would benefit the poorest more than the richest.&#13;
Figure 7 Protecting Poorer Gas Consumers: Tariff Restructuring&#13;
I 0%&#13;
39.   Such a gas-specific scheme would be simple and quick to introduce and would facilitate an&#13;
increase in the average residential tariff. Furthermore, it could be considered a short term measureo&#13;
pending the introduction of meters and the redesign of the tariff structure. At that point in time, a lifeline&#13;
block with a preferential tariff could be considered. The principle drawback of such a scheme, however,&#13;
is that it distorts relative prices further, and reinforces incentives to use gas inefficiently - namely, using&#13;
cookers for heating. In addition, while low-income households are the primary beneficiaries of the&#13;
change, the preferential tariff continues to confer a substantial monetary beniefit on high-income&#13;
households. Perhaps more importantly, while the reduction in gas bills is significant, the poorest 40&#13;
percent of gas consuming households would spend more on heat than is presently the case across&#13;
Azerbaijan.&#13;
40.   Including support for gas costs as part of the general social safety net eliminates some of the&#13;
problems associated with fuirther manipulations of the gas tariff. In this case, however, a delivery&#13;
mechanism to handle the targeting and transfer of the subsidy is needed. One option would be to utilize&#13;
the existing bread compensation scheme as a basis for delivering a targeted subsidy for gas supply.&#13;
41.   The Social Protection Fund's bread compensation scheme attempts to target benefits exclusively&#13;
to the poor. Compensation under the bread scheme is available to:&#13;
-non-working pensioners - M8,500 per month; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 1 5&#13;
children of poor families - M6,000 per child - where poverty is specified as three times the&#13;
minimum wage for each member of the household. At the present minimum wage of M5,500,&#13;
the average threshold in Azerbaijan would be M80,850.&#13;
42.   In addition, the Ministry of Education and the Refugee Committee make similar compensatory&#13;
payments to students and refugees. The latter are means tested in the same way as the SPF's poor family&#13;
allowance. These social welfare payments are financed directly by the State Budget.&#13;
43.   The bread compensation scheme has been criticized as poorly targeted on the basis that:&#13;
-      non-working pensioners are not means tested;&#13;
-      the means test for poor families considers only formal sector employment to assess income. All&#13;
informal sector activity and most private employment is not captured; and&#13;
-      the income thresholds and the income period used to assess claims are distorted by Azerbaijan's&#13;
rapid inflation.&#13;
44.    Results from the Household Survey show that, while households in all deciles are receiving&#13;
benefits under the bread compensation scheme, the bread allowances are generally progressively&#13;
targeted. In absolute terms, the poorest decile receives an average M7,200 per household against M2,900&#13;
in the wealthiest decile. In relative terms, of course, the allowance is much more important to poorer&#13;
households. In short, the scheme is progressive and reasonably well targeted to the poor. Non-working&#13;
pensioners are more heavily concentrated amongst poorer households; and the average income threshold&#13;
of M80,850 does not appear to be fundamentally out of line. The problem appears to be one of&#13;
implementation rather than design. For example, all gas consuming households earn salaries above the&#13;
income threshold, yet most are receiving benefits. Similarly, the SPF report that some 1.1 million non-&#13;
working pensioners received payments under the scheme in 1995. However, the Household Survey&#13;
suggests that, at most, there are 700,000 non-working pensioners in Azerbaijan. These issues of design&#13;
and implementation will be considered further by the Azeri authorities and the World Bank under the&#13;
Poverty Assessment over the coming months.&#13;
45.    A scheme of providing fuel coupons along with bread allowances through the bread&#13;
compensation scheme would provide a convenient and relatively well targeted mechanism for delivering&#13;
protection against gas price increases to low-income households. Whether these coupons should be&#13;
focussed strictly on gas users, however, raises broader issues of equity. The present policy of gas&#13;
shortages and selective supply is highly inequitable. As seen above, gas consumers spend less on energy&#13;
and have higher incomes. Introducing a gas-specific safety net would simply reinforce these inequalities.&#13;
Indeed, even if gas supplies are restored to the rest of the country, it is not at all clear that gas consumers&#13;
should receive preferential treatment as compared to consumers of other network fuels or market-priced&#13;
fuels.&#13;
46.   Instead, it would be preferable to introduce energy coupons which would be distributed&#13;
alongside the bread compensation scheme. It would be more efficient if these coupons could be to meet&#13;
energy bills for a range of network fuels; however, they could equally be restricted initially to gas&#13;
consumption. Such coupons would:&#13;
be targeted to the poor rather than all households;&#13;
not discriminate between energy products consumed;&#13;
support a more general realignment of tariffs for all network fuels; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 16&#13;
-     reduce the risk and level of arrears following an increase in energy tariffs, and pending&#13;
strengthening of the billing and collection systems.&#13;
47.   The targeting of these coupons would mirror the bread compensation scheme. In other words,&#13;
benefits would be progressively distributed across income groups, and the targeting would improve as&#13;
the bread compensation scheme is reviewed. Furthermore, given that the bread compensation scheme is&#13;
already up and running, the energy coupons could be introduced quickly and without great administrative&#13;
expense. The potential impact on gas consumers of such a proposal is illustrated in Figure 8. The figure&#13;
illustrates the impact of a M12500 energy coupon to non-working pensioners only. (It does not consider&#13;
the means tested child benefit). As can be seen, the incidence of gas bills on the poorest 20 percent of&#13;
gas consuming households is sharply reduced.&#13;

*-      FM -~&#13;
48.   As the figure shows, the energy coupon scheme directs the total costs of the subsidy towards low&#13;
income households more effectively than adjustments to the gas tariff. While the example tested (i.e. a&#13;
coupon of M12,500 only to non-working pensioners) would still leave the average cost of heating well&#13;
above the revealed willingness to pay (i.e. the current level of household heating costs), additional&#13;
refinement of the coupon scheme to include other households at low income levels would help to rectify&#13;
this problem.&#13;
Fiscal Impacts of Alternative Subsidy Mechanisms&#13;
49.   At present, gas consumers are subsidised through the subsidised tariff available to all household&#13;
consumers, and discounts available to specific consumer categories. The former subsidy is financed by&#13;
high industrial and commercial tariffs, and the financial losses and arrears of the gas distribution&#13;
company. The latter subsidy, in principle, is financed by the Government. In practice, there are&#13;
substantial arrears in budgetary disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 63 -&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 17&#13;
50.    Table 7 shows gas subsidies per annum under different tariff options and by source of finance.6&#13;
At current tariffs and assuming that gas supplies are restored households are subsidised by over $36&#13;
million. This comprises the discounts offered to specific consumer groups, and the cost of holding tariffs&#13;
below cost recovery levels. The overwhelming proportion of this subsidy is financed by Azerigaz itself.&#13;
This ensures that without tariff reform, the gas distribution company is highly unlikely to become&#13;
financially viable.&#13;

51.    As tariffs are increased, the cost of the subsidy declines and the financing burden shifts between&#13;
Azerigaz and the Government. In short, as tariffs rise, the cost of exemptions to specific consumer&#13;
categories rises rapidly. Under a M63,500 tariff, the cost of these exemptions to the Government would&#13;
be almost $19 million. Exemptions are not only poorly targeted but are expensive.&#13;
52.     Table 7 also shows the cost of the Social tariff and the cost of the energy coupon described&#13;
earlier. The cost of both these schemes is less than the cost of exemptions under a 10 fold tariff increase.&#13;
In formulating the Social Tariff and energy coupon options discussed above, effort was taken to keep the&#13;
over all subsidy cost the same. The analysis therefore strongly suggests that the most cost-effective&#13;
option available to deliver assistance to poor households is the energy coupon. At the same cost as the&#13;
Social Tariff, the energy coupon scheme makes a 10 fold tariff increase feasible.&#13;
53.    Nevertheless, increasing tariffs to M63,500 and introducing an energy coupon will increase the&#13;
cost of subsidies to the Government (but not to the economy) by $12.5 million. The resources required,&#13;
however, are relatively small - the bread compensation scheme was budgeted at almost $60 million for&#13;
1995. In return, Government will achieve better targeted assistance to poor households than is currently&#13;
provided through Azerigaz's financial losses and exemptions.&#13;
6      The subsidy is estimated as the difference between revenues under current tariffs and the M63,500 per&#13;
MCM tariff (assumed to be the cost recovery tariff). Hence, at current tariffs, this comprises a subsidy on gas&#13;
purchased from SOCAR and Turkmenistan, and on distribution costs.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN GAS SYSTEM REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF THE LPG INDUSTRY&#13;
1. Production&#13;
1.     LPG is supplied from four different plants in Azerbaijan: (a) Aznefteyanacak (New Baku)&#13;
Refinery with a maximum yearly LPG production capacity of 90,000 tons, (b) Karadag natural gas&#13;
processing plant of SOCAR with a maximum yearly LPG production capacity of 30,000 tons, (c)&#13;
Azerigaz NGL processing unit operated by the LPG Branch with a maximum yearly LPG production&#13;
capacity of 1,100 tons, and (d) Sumgait (40 km. from Baku) Sythetic Rubber Factory owned by&#13;
Azerkimya, where propane and butane which are by-products of this chemical industry are retained by&#13;
the LPG Branch of Azerigaz .&#13;
2.     Production, however, is constrained by inputs to these plants which are not sufficient to produce&#13;
the maximum output. Particularly due to the decline in oil production and consequently the crude input&#13;
to the Aznefteyanacak Refinery and the limited amount of local gas production, the LPG production has&#13;
declined in 1994 and 1995. 2 The Karadag - SOCAR Gas Plant has worked at only 50% of capacity due&#13;
largely to inadequate compression of domestic gas supplies. The plant (built in the 1960's) is now&#13;
obsolete.&#13;
II. Consumption&#13;
3.     Local distribution peaked in 1989 with around 62,000 tons supplied by imports from Russia to&#13;
450,000 customers, but declined steadily to some 24,000 tons in 1994 supplied to 240,000 customers.&#13;
The sharp price increases beginning 1993 have caused a decline in demand particularly in households but&#13;
also industries (Tables I and 2). Table 1 shows a more slowly declining market for LPG use in cars in&#13;
1994 and 1995.&#13;
4.     In terms of demand outlook, the dependence on natural gas imports, the occasional shortages of&#13;
supply due to regional disruption in gas production, and the shortages in the remote regions of the&#13;
country not suitable for network distribution of natural gas could justify the expansion of LPG use for&#13;
cooking in the medium-term. It must be noted that the natural gas network is extended beyond the&#13;
maximum possible limits and the regions at the periphery and those that are beyond the network are good&#13;
candidates for expanding the LPG market. Particularly, following the Presidential Decree banning all&#13;
natural gas imports from Turkmenistan for the rest of 19953, the areas where gas is cut off will have&#13;
relatively higher demand for LPG. At the same time, it is envisaged that LPG usage for cooking will be&#13;
limited within this framework in areas where natural gas is available since LPG prices compare quite&#13;
The propane-butane fraction of this product is around 70-80% which is too high quality for the purposes of&#13;
cooking. Moreover, the Sumgait plant sells this high quality product at 1,500,000 manats/ton while the other LPG&#13;
producing plants sell at 467,000 manats/ton. Note that the retail price is 750,000 manats/ton. There is demand for&#13;
this product in Russia but the roads are closed.&#13;
2 The production plan by the Ministry of Economy for 1994 was 70,000 tons, however only 22,000 tons were&#13;
supplied to the LPG Branch of Azerigaz for distribution during this year. The plan set by the Ministry for 1995 is&#13;
102,000 tons (70,000 tons from the Aznefteyanacak Refinery and 30,000 tons from the Karadag Plant), however&#13;
the actual distribution by the LPG Branch of Azerigaz for the first 8 months was limited to 10,005 tons.&#13;
3The decree was issued following balance of payments problems which to a large extent were caused by natural gas&#13;
imports from Turkmenistan. Virtually all the country outside the three largest cities was without gas in the second&#13;
half of 1995.&#13;

unfavorably to natural gas which is heavily subsidized4. Regarding LPG use in cars, the current high&#13;
demand seems transitory due to price distortions between LPG and gasoline. No further expansion is&#13;
envisaged in the medium-term when the gap between these prices dissappears.&#13;

III. Distribution&#13;
5.     There are eight LPG bottling plants in Azerbaijan: Ali-Bayramli, Yevlak, Berde, Horadiz,&#13;
Sumgait, Siyazan, Nakhchevan, and Baku. LPG is carried by rail tankers with 25 ton capacity from the&#13;
producing plants to the first five of these bottling plants. The LPG Branch owns some 360-390 rail&#13;
tankers for this purpose. The last three bottling plants are supplied by road tankers, although supply to&#13;
the bottling plant in Nakhchevan is handicapped by the political situation in Nagorno-Karabag.&#13;
Distribution through cylinders/road tankers compares unfavorably to rail-based distribution in terms of&#13;
capacity, i.e cylinders can handle only five tons while the capacity of rail tankers ranges between 20-25&#13;
tons. Moreover, the road tankers are rather old and lack adequate metering sytems. They should&#13;
eventually be replaced with larger capacity tankers.&#13;
6.     From the bottling plants to end-users, the shipment is again made by road tankers/cylinders to&#13;
households and car filling stations. Most of the LPG provided to households is supplied in customer-&#13;
owned bottles. (Some 477,000 bottles are owned by households while the LPG Branch owns some&#13;
29,000 bottles). Every year some 80,000 bottles are tested and about 5,000 are considered out of order.&#13;
There is a bottle producing plant in Baku and the current price of one bottle is around 100,000-120,000&#13;
manats (around $US20) which is not affordable to a large part of the population.&#13;
7.     Transportation costs vary depending on the distance. The railway costs are particularly high.&#13;
This is mainly due to the high maintenance and operational costs of the rail tankers, which are about 40&#13;
years old . Moreover, there is no local capacity in the country to fully repair the railtankers. In some&#13;
cases, the cost of providing LPG to certain regions exceeds the selling price for that region due to the&#13;
decline in sales and the high fixed costs of operations. In remote regions where railroads do not exist,&#13;
distribution of LPG through road tankers is carried out at a loss to the company. On the other hand,&#13;
distribution expenses to filling stations for cars are much less than those distributed to households for&#13;
cooking i.e. around 30,000-40,000 manats/ton to filling stations as opposed to average regional&#13;
distribution costs of 87,000 manats to Berde (remotest region supplied) and 60,000 manats/ton to Ali-&#13;
Bayramli (nearer region).&#13;
4 The current price of LPG is 750,000 manats/ton or $US 169.1 /ton at the current exchange rate. This is the&#13;
equivalent of SUS62.7/1000 cm of natural gas. Gas to households is sold at a much lower price of SUSI.41/1000&#13;
cm.&#13;
5 Every 10 years there is a need of total capital repair which currently costs a total of around 10 million manats&#13;
(SUS 2,222). Every two years containers inside the rail tankers need to be repaired which costs 350,000&#13;
manats/rail tanker ($US 77) .&#13;

IV. LPG Utilization in Cars&#13;
8.     Demand for LPG in the transport sector has been quite stable (see Table 1) despite the sharp&#13;
price increases. This is the result of a faster increase in gasoline prices than LPG prices for cars.&#13;
Currently gasoline is 1,000 manats/It. as opposed to 425 manats/It. of LPG. The conversion kits that are&#13;
installed in cars were previously imported from Ukraine and due to the disruption of this trade currently&#13;
there is a shortage. The value of these kits is reported to be around $100-120. LPG usage in&#13;
transportation is not widespread in the country and the number of filling stations are limited and&#13;
concentrated in the Baku area: (a) between Baku - Karadag (8-10 km. from Baku), (b) Nizami&#13;
Neighborhood - Baku, (c) Binagadi Neighborhood - Baku, (d) Sumgait (40 km. from Baku), (e)&#13;
Lenkaran, and (f) Ali-Bayramli (recent and not yet in operation). In addition to these, there are 12 road&#13;
tankers that are used as mobile filling stations. The average storage capacity of filling stations is 100 m3&#13;
or 20 to 45 days of sales which is oversized. Due to the shortage of LPG in the country, as opposed to the&#13;
ready availability of gasoline from domestic oil production, it is unlikely that LPG use in transportation&#13;
is economic.&#13;
V. Trade&#13;
9.     Currently, there is a limited regional market for exports.-LPG was previously supplied to the&#13;
region (also to Azerbaijan) by the Grozny Refinery in Chechnia-Russia and due to the war in this region&#13;
these supplies have been disrupted. Therefore, currently there is demand in Armenia, Dagestan (Russia),&#13;
Ukraine, and also Belorussia. However, all routes to these markets are closed due to the political&#13;
situation even though railroads exist to realize the shipments.&#13;
10.    The LPG Branch exported 2,000 tons of LPG to Georgia in 1994 and has a new contract to ship&#13;
2,000 tons in 1995. The shipment is made by rail to the Georgian border. The contracted price is&#13;
$200/ton fob Tblisi in hard currency which includes a transport cost of 113,680 manats to the Georgian&#13;
border (about $US25). Products for export are bought from the LPG plants at a pre-tax price (similar to&#13;
exported petroleum products). However, the contract between the LPG Branch of Azerigaz and the&#13;
Aznefteyanacak Refinery requires the approval of the contracted price by the Refinery and by the&#13;
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, which adds a bureaucratic burden on the company and regional&#13;
trade. On the other hand, export revenues are actually collected, and in the medium term, the regional&#13;
market could expand as political stability is.reached.&#13;
VI. Pricing and Taxation&#13;
I1.    Since the beginning of 1993, LPG prices have sharply increased. Currently, the ex-refinery price&#13;
of LPG is 467,712 manats/ton (around $104/ton) while the wholesale price for all types of consumers is&#13;
750,000 manats/ton ($169/ton). The LPG retail business is subject to nine different taxes including VAT,&#13;
Income Tax, Road Fund. However, despite the sharp fall in sales in 1994 and 1995, Azerigaz claims that&#13;
the LPG Branch has made a net profit of 169 million manats in 1994 ($US 116,000 at the average annual&#13;
exchange rate) and 300 million manats for the 8 months of 1995 (around $US 60,000). The mode of&#13;
immediate payment at the sale point makes collection more reliable compared to natural gas and the&#13;
company seems to follow a strict policy of payment collection.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN REPUBLIC&#13;
GAS SYSTEM REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ACTION PLAN ON GAS PAYMENTS&#13;
This Action Plan is based upon the rights and obligations of Azerigaz under Decrees of the&#13;
Cabinet of Ministers No. 156 (April 20, 1994 ) and No. 13 (February 7, 1996) to require pre-payment for gas&#13;
and to cut off non-paying customers.&#13;
The Action Plan includes the following provisions:&#13;
I.     For revenue-earning customers&#13;
(a)          As of September 1, 1996, Azerigaz is required to supply gas only on receipt of Pre-payment&#13;
or Letter of Credit to all revenue earning customers with the exception of Azerenerji and&#13;
other enterprises which are providing services essential to the survival of the population (e.g.&#13;
district heating, bread production, water supply).&#13;
(b)          Effective December 1, 1996, the exception granted above to Azerenerji and other "essential"&#13;
enterprises will be withdrawn and they will be supplied on the same Pre-payment basis as&#13;
other revenue earning customers.&#13;
II.    For non-revenue-earning customers:&#13;
(c)          The list of agencies and entities to be exempted from using the Pre-payment or Letter of&#13;
Credit forms of payment should be finalized by the Government by August 23, 1996.&#13;
Exemptions will be based upon the importance of enterprises or entities to the social welfare&#13;
of the population or upon specific security and safety considerations.&#13;
(d)          In the event that exempted agencies fail to make timely payment for gas supply, the&#13;
Government will, beginning from January 1, 1997, take responsibility for their payment&#13;
obligations and will make prompt payment to Azerigaz on their behalf.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN GAS SYSTEM REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
AND ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
I.     Significant Impacts on the Environment&#13;
No significant impacts are anticipated to result from the project. For the purpose of full&#13;
documentation and disclosure, the impacts which have been considered are described below and mitigation&#13;
measures for them are proposed:&#13;
A.    Potential Adverse Impacts&#13;
Implementation of cathodic protection systems, purchase of new equipment for maintenance and&#13;
operation, and installation of new and replacement meters are not expected to result in adverse impacts. The&#13;
origin and specifications for the new equipment will not be known until vendors are selected after competitive&#13;
bids are received. Pipeline replacement will result in short term construction related impacts. This would&#13;
include traffic circulation, air quality, odor, soil erosion, water quality, noise and public safety risks.&#13;
Traffic Circulation and Other Public Activities: There will be a potential temporary disruption of&#13;
traffic movement, consisting of delays due to increased traffic on local roads and detours due to excavation at&#13;
road intersections. Disruption of recreational activities may also occur, for example, if the pipe replacement&#13;
area coincides with a public park or recreation area, a school or another public use.&#13;
Air Quality: Construction activities will create dust during clearing and grading activities, during&#13;
trench digging and while moving soil. However, dust will result in only localized air quality impacts because&#13;
most of the particulate matter will settle out immediately downwind of the source. Localized dust emission&#13;
impacts can be mitigated by applying water sprays to the construction area. The exhausts from construction&#13;
vehicles will emit chemicals that are precursors to photochemical smog formation. These emissions will have&#13;
a more regional impact because of the long atmospheric reaction times to form smog. However, these&#13;
emissions will be very small when compared to other mobile and industrial source emissions of the region.&#13;
There, the impacts will not be significant. Old pipe segments will be purged of gas after new sections of&#13;
main are installed. Blowdowns release natural gas to the atmosphere. Because natural gas is lighter than air,&#13;
it will rise quickly, mix, and be diluted to a level at which it would not be a concern to human health.&#13;
Odor: Gas venting will result in odor at blowdown sites. Under certain climatic conditions, the&#13;
vented gas may drift in sufficient concentrations to be detected over a substantial distance. The duration of&#13;
detectability in these cases is usually from a few minutes to an hour. Odors can also be emitted from&#13;
exhausts on the diesel construction equipment. However, these impacts will only be localized and temporary,&#13;
usually occurring during vehicle acceleration.&#13;
Soil Erosion: In hilly areas, there would be a potential for increased soil erosion as a result of pipe&#13;
replacement activities.&#13;
Water Quality: Some of the pipe replacement locations may be in areas of rivers, streams and&#13;
reservoirs. If old degraded pipes are not removed and disposed of properly, this could result in degradation of&#13;
water quality. The release of hydrostatic test wastewater could also result in an impact on water quality.&#13;
Construction Noise: There will be a temporary increase in noise levels during construction. Trucks,&#13;
bulldozers and welding equipment will be required for grading, trenching, pipe laying and backfilling. These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 2&#13;
pieces of equipment produce noise levels of 70 - 95 dBA at a distance of about 15 meters. These noise levels&#13;
are not higher than ambient levels in urban locations in daytime, and therefore the temporary incremental&#13;
increase in noise levels is not considered to be significant. Gas venting usually take about an hour. Venting&#13;
is required at both ends of the replaced pipe section. Venting will take place occasionally over the term of the&#13;
pipe replacement program. Because the duration of the noise is only one hour, this is not considered to be a&#13;
significant impact. Nevertheless, mitigation measures are proposed to inform nearby residents and&#13;
commercial establishments of the time of venting in advance.&#13;
Public Safety Risks: The old pipes that will be removed will be purged of gas and then removed.&#13;
The pipes that are abandoned in place will be cut, capped and filled with inert nitrogen gas to eliminate future&#13;
risks. Therefore no potential for increased public safety risks is foreseen.&#13;
B.    Potential Beneficial Impacts&#13;
Reduced Methane Leak Potential: Replacement of deteriorated pipes, installation of cathodic&#13;
protection, and new testing equipment will substantially eliminate gas leaks and result in two impacts:&#13;
*      improved public safety through reduced risk of explosion due to undetected leaks;&#13;
a cumulative beneficial impact resulting from the reduced potential for release of methane to&#13;
the atmosphere, thus reducing the greenhouse effect. Since methane emissions produce a&#13;
greenhouse signal that is 20 to 50 times greater than carbon dioxide for equivalent&#13;
emissions, it is the second most significant greenhouse gas being emitted by man's activities.&#13;
Potentialfor Gas Conservation: The installation of upgraded and new metering, together with&#13;
proposed gas price reforms, is expected to promote more efficient use of gas by industrial and commercial&#13;
customers. This in turn will reduce the amount of gas consumption associated with given levels of output,&#13;
thereby providing a benefit in terms of reduced C02 and particulate emissions.&#13;
Substitution of Gas for Other Fuels: The combination of conservation and loss reduction resulting&#13;
from the project will, at least during periods of supply constraint and import curtailment, increase the amount&#13;
of gas available to consumers. The recent Survey of Living Conditions (November/December 1995) showed&#13;
that, in response to gas supply shortages, over 40 percent of the population were using fuelwood as their&#13;
primary fuel for heating and cooking - even though the gas network itself extends to 80 percent of the&#13;
country. Reducing fuelwood use by increasing the available gas supply will reduce deforestation, which is&#13;
reported to be occuring at a rapid rate.&#13;
II.    Mitigation Measures&#13;
Three types of mitigation measures are proposed: construction mitigation measures for pipe&#13;
replacement; enhancement of environmental management capability; and, public involvement during the&#13;
construction process.&#13;
A.    Construction Mitigation Measures for Pipe Replacement&#13;
Protection of Other Utilities: Prior to construction, the location of other utilities underground and&#13;
above ground in the vicinity of the pipe will be identified and any necessary permits from local authorities&#13;
obtained. During construction all the other utility steel structures will be protected. Each utility would&#13;
remain in full operation during construction. All ditches will be returned to their original condition or better.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 3&#13;
Construction Safety: Pertinent information on safety procedures will be disseminated to all levels of&#13;
personnel involved in the project. Safety hazards of concern include: dangerous machines with moving parts,&#13;
electricity, ergonomic factors such as physiological and psychological stresses on the human body, eye&#13;
protection, falls, fires and explosions, heat or cold stresses, moving and lifting equipment, noise, vibrations,&#13;
and combinations of several of these hazards which can exacerbate danger and injury.&#13;
Research of Pipelines: No excavation will be undertaken until detailed research on the existing&#13;
underground structures is completed by qualified pipeline engineers. All underground structures, their sizes,&#13;
locations, depths, material carried and ownership will be identified, in order to prevent damage from external&#13;
sources and damage from construction activities to existing underground facilities.&#13;
Pot Holing: Pot holing, or advance digging in the area to locate the position of underground&#13;
structures, will be performed carefully by hand if necessary when a pipeline is near. Pot holing will be used&#13;
whenever it is necessary to locate the position of underground structures.&#13;
Protection of Existing Draining Patterns: At stream or river crossings, pipeline will be buried at&#13;
least 3 meters under the scour line.&#13;
Erosion Control: In hilly areas where there is a potential for erosion, an erosion control plan will be&#13;
prepared to keep stripping of vegetation to a minimum, control the velocity and direction of the runoff,&#13;
protect slopes, stabilize soil, and reestablish native vegetation in natural areas.&#13;
Dust Control: The construction area would be sprayed with water to control dust.&#13;
Construction Noise: Prior to venting of gas, notice would be given to surrounding area residents and&#13;
commercial and industrial establishments. The approximate time for venting and the anticipated noise level&#13;
would be disclosed at that time. Insofar as possible, construction activities would take place only during the&#13;
daytime, and would conform to city noise ordinances and regulations as applicable.&#13;
Treatment of Removed Pipes: Old pipes that are removed would be purged of all gas. Pipes that are&#13;
abandoned in place would be cut, capped and filled with inert nitrogen gas to eliminate future risks.&#13;
Water Quality: Hydrostatic test water would be drawn from nearby sources, pressured in the pipe,&#13;
tested for contamination and discharged to an existing waterway.&#13;
Solid Waste: All solid waste generated at the construction site would be removed and deposited at an&#13;
approved solid waste disposal facility.&#13;
Construction Inspection: Inspectors would be designated by Azerigaz to perform regular&#13;
inspections of construction activities to ensure that contractors are following the proper procedures and that&#13;
they are taking precautions in conformance with local occupational health and safety provisions.&#13;
Fire Protection and Emergency Response: An Emergency Response Plan would be prepared for the&#13;
project prior to construction. The Environmental Coordinator within Azerigaz would be responsible for&#13;
preparing the plan, managing its implementation, and reviewing it as necessary. Proper safety and fire&#13;
fighting equipment would be provided at the construction sites and arrangements made in advance with&#13;
emergency response teams in the area. Personnel would be trained in the use of safety equipment and&#13;
periodic drills would be given in emergency procedures. Safety reminders would be issued to all staff&#13;
periodically, and visitors to construction sites would be briefed on potential hazards and necessary safety&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 4&#13;
precautions. The Environmental Coordinator unit would also be responsible for informing the local&#13;
population about potential emergencies which could arise either during or subsequent to construction, and for&#13;
ensuring that they are familiar with appropriate responses to ensure their safety.&#13;
Continuation of Vehicular Circulation: Steps would be taken to minimize disruption of vehicular&#13;
circulation around the construction site. These would include detouring of traffic around the construction&#13;
area, directing traffic along one half of the roadway, and routing traffic over temporary trench bridging.&#13;
Detours would be properly signed, and personnel deployed to direct traffic if necessary.&#13;
Vehicular Safety during Construction: All laws dealing with vehicle safety would be adhered to to&#13;
avoid vehicular accidents as a result of added heavy traffic on the road. The construction area would be&#13;
appropriately signed to alert motorists and pedestrians. Temporary lighting and personnel would be deployed&#13;
to direct traffic if necessary to ensure safe movement in the construction areas.&#13;
Mitigation Monitoring: Monitoring of the implementation of mitigation measures would occur&#13;
before, during and after the pipe replacement has taken place. Monitoring would encompass all mitigation&#13;
measures required as conditions of the project to ensure that they have been properly executed. Monitoring&#13;
would be the responsibility of the Environmental Coordinator of the project.&#13;
B.    Enhancement of Environmental Management Capability&#13;
In order to ensure that the project mitigation plan is executed effectively, the environmental&#13;
management capability of Azenrgaz needs to be enhanced. A new position of Environmental Coordinator&#13;
should be established within the Project Implementation Unit. The position would include responsibility for&#13;
ensuring that the mitigation measures are carried out according to the technical details, descriptions and&#13;
operations procedures specified, that monitoring of mitigation and reporting procedures are carried out&#13;
properly, and that funds allocation for implementation of mitigation are used for their intended purpose.&#13;
C.    Public Involvement&#13;
Public involvement would be solicited as part of the project for the general public and enterprises&#13;
that would be affected by short term construction impacts of the project. The program would be planned to&#13;
inform the public about the purpose of the project, the short-term adverse impacts that may be anticipated,&#13;
the mitigation measures that will be undertaken, and the long term benefits of the project. The program&#13;
would begin prior to construction and continue until the completion of the construction period. The program&#13;
would include notices in the local press, distribution of hand-outs, and site tours in areas to be disturbed.&#13;
Citizen concems and suggestions for added mitigation measures would be incorporated in project procedures&#13;
as appropriate.&#13;
III.   Implementation and Cost of Mitigation Measures&#13;
A.    Implementation Responsibility&#13;
Implementation of the construction mitigation measures will be the responsibility of the engineering&#13;
contractor for the project, and subsequently of the construction contractor. Adherence to the mitigations will&#13;
be specified in bid documents for these contractors, and Azerigaz will assign inspectors for the duration of&#13;
the activity to ensure that they are carried out. The designation of an Environmental Coordinator should take&#13;
place at project inception.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN GAS SYSTEM REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
PROCUREMENT ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION&#13;
(PEMS)&#13;
GENERAL BACKGROUND&#13;
1.     Azerigaz is a national gas company wholly owned by the Government of Azerbaijan. Its principal&#13;
activities include purchase of indigenous natural gas produced by SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan&#13;
Republic); gas import, primarily from Turkmenistan; transmission of natural gas to domestic markets as well&#13;
as transit to other countries of the region; operation of two underground gas storage; and distribution of&#13;
natural gas to end users in Azerbaijan. Azerigaz is also in charge of transporting, bottling and distributing&#13;
LPG to end users. These activities which were previously conducted as part of a centralized ministry of the&#13;
FSU, have been vested to Azerigaz since 1992. The company employs approximately 16 000 people and is&#13;
managed as an autonomous entity.&#13;
2.     The Government of Azerbaijan (GOA) has applied for a credit from the International Development&#13;
Association, (IDA, a member of the World Bank Group) for the implementation of the proposed Gas System&#13;
Rehabilitation Project. Part of this loan would be used to finance the cost of this consultancy assignment.&#13;
3.     Azerigaz's transmission system includes some 5,000 km high pressure pipelines and 224 MW in-&#13;
stalled compressor capacity. It is capable of transporting the gas produced by SOCAR and also imports from&#13;
Turkmenistan and Iran. Currently, the gas transmission network receives gas from offshore Caspian fields,&#13;
from onshore fields and from underground storage. The transmission system delivers gas to approximately&#13;
120 points including underground storage sites, major industrial consumers, and city gate stations. It also has&#13;
the capability to transit gas to other countries; however, at present there is no re-export through Azerbaijan.&#13;
4.     Until April of 1995, gas was also imported from Turkmenistan and, occasionally, Iran, in order to&#13;
meet full domestic requirements. While these imports previously constituted approximately 30 percent of gas&#13;
supply, the Government has barred gas imports since April, 1995 owing to concerns over physical losses and&#13;
reluctance to incur further foreign debt. As a result, substantial areas of the country are not receiving gas at&#13;
the present time. While the Government and Azerigaz do not anticipate the resumption of gas imports in the&#13;
near future, they also regard the interruption in supply to outlying areas as a temporary condition which will&#13;
reverse as consumption is rationalized and as domestic supplies of gas increase.&#13;
5.     The gas received from SOCAR contains significant water and liquid hydrocarbons and is not of&#13;
pipeline quality. In fact only about one third of the gas produced offshore by SOCAR is processed in the&#13;
Karadag plant, which is in a poor state of repair and does not have any dehydration facilities. It is envisaged&#13;
that the necessary offshore compression and dehydration facilities would be installed by SOCAR to restore&#13;
the offshore gas fields production. Currently, a technical study is being conducted under a World Bank&#13;
funded technical assistance project to review and propose optimum gas processing plans for SOCAR.&#13;
6.     Azerigaz operates two underground gas storages in depleted fields, Karadag and Kalmas, both of&#13;
which need major rehabilitation due to obsolete and unsafe surface facilities. Further, Azerigaz has been&#13;
withdrawing from the cushion gas of these two structures to compensate for the gas supply to domestic&#13;
consumers. Rehabilitation of Karadag and Kalmas is being reviewed under a study funded by TACIS.&#13;
7.     The distribution system, with some 40,000 km of pipeline which supplies gas to over one million&#13;
consumers, is practically not metered. Although a large percentage of industrial customers are metered, their&#13;
meters are old and in a state of disrepair with very low accuracy. In the residential sector, only a few hundred&#13;
meters have been installed. This lack of gas measurement leads to large discrepancies between actual gas&#13;
consumptions and billed quantities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
Annex 4.1&#13;
Page 2&#13;
8.     The gas transmission system as well as the distribution system are practically under no cathodic&#13;
protection and are severely suffering from corrosion. Leak detection is assured by continuous monitoring of&#13;
pipelines. Network maintenance has been adversely affected by lack of financial resources to procure materi-&#13;
als and spare parts.&#13;
9.     Azerigaz's LPG Division receives LPG from plants operated by SOCAR, Azerigas and Azerchimia.&#13;
LPG is transported by rail to eight bottling plants operated by Azerigaz. Cylinders are filled in these plants&#13;
and delivered to end users by road trucks. The distribution system for LPG is also obsolete and is suffering&#13;
from lack of spare parts.&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
10.    Against the above background, Azerigaz and the World Bank have initiated a gas system&#13;
rehabilitation project (GSRP). Sofregaz was retained as consultant to carry out a study of the investments&#13;
needed for rehabilitation of the gas transmission and distribution systems and to prioritize these investments.&#13;
Upon request, copies of the Sofregaz report would be provided to the consultants invited to bid for the&#13;
PEMS assignment. Based on the Sofregaz report, and as a result of discussions between the World Bank and&#13;
Azerigaz, the following components have been identified as critical to the rehabilitation of the transmission&#13;
and distribution systems in Azerbaijan, and for funding under the proposed GSRP:&#13;
Metering: The metering component would include: (a) rehabilitation of the city gate meter stations&#13;
throughout Azerbaijan by replacing the existing instrumentation or by replacing the entire meter at some&#13;
stations; (b) installing new meters at industrial and large commercial consumers who currently have no&#13;
meters; and (c) rehabilitating the metering at the industrial consumers who currently have meters by either&#13;
replacing the meters or replacing the measuring instrumentation. In addition, financing would be provided to&#13;
acquire related meter proving equipment and equipment packages to facilitate meter installation.&#13;
a.     City Gate Stations: Approximately 214 meter sets at the city gate stations would be&#13;
rehabilitated or replaced under the project. This includes all the city gate stations which are&#13;
currently in operation in Azerbaijan and those industries which are fed directly from the&#13;
main high pressure pipeline. This program would cover all of the locations where gas is&#13;
currently delivered from the main transmission pipelines.&#13;
b.     New and Replacement Meters: Approximately 465 industrial and large commercial&#13;
consumers are currently operating without metering and these would have meters installed.&#13;
Approximately 690 industrial and large non-industrial consumers are currently operating&#13;
with meters which are either not functioning or are obsolete and inaccurate. The larger&#13;
consumers would have instrumentation replaced and some consumers would also have the&#13;
meters replaced, where this is justified.&#13;
c.    Meter Proving Equipment: Meter proving equipment will also be purchased for each meter&#13;
type and housed in appropriately constructed facilities that would meet international&#13;
standards.&#13;
d.    Installation Equipment: This component would include three vehicles equipped with lifting&#13;
and welding equipment and necessary tools to modernize and facilitate installation of meter&#13;
sets.&#13;
Cathodic Protection System Rehabilitation: The cathodic protection (CP) of the pipeline system&#13;
throughout Azerbaijan is in poor condition and in need of rehabilitation, largely as a result of a lack of funds&#13;
for investment. The CP rehabilitation component would focus on the Apsheron peninsula and cover about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
Annex 4. 1&#13;
Page 3&#13;
2,700 km of pipelines serving that area. The rehabilitation program would include electrically isolating the&#13;
pipelines into discrete sections, designing the detailed CP requirements for each section and then installing&#13;
the required CP for each section. A specialized consultant would assist Azerigaz in the initial isolation of two&#13;
sections, one on the transmission system and another one on the distribution network, carrying out the design&#13;
and training Azenrgaz to continue the work. In addition to the CP equipment, an allowance for approximately&#13;
900 tons of large diameter pipe has been included in the cost estimate. This would be used to replace&#13;
seriously corroded pipe which is discovered during implementation.&#13;
Analytical Equipment: This component consists of three sub-components: (a) gas quality test&#13;
equipment; (b) leak detection equipment; and (c) computer software and hardware to undertake network&#13;
modeling.&#13;
Technical Assistance: This includes modernization of office equipment including expansion of&#13;
computer application, and training in modem commercial business and management practices, as well as the&#13;
assistance in procurement, engineering, management and supervision which is the subject of these terms of&#13;
reference.&#13;
OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSULTANCY SERVICES&#13;
11.    The main objective of the consultancy assignment is to assist Azerigaz to provide a complete&#13;
engineering and management package for the proposed project components. In this regard, the Consultant&#13;
will work with the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within Azerigaz, the core of which has been established&#13;
as a liaison unit during the Sofregaz consultancy. On assignment of the project, the Consultant will promptly&#13;
plan and render all necessary advice to the client for causing the project to be executed expeditiously and&#13;
economically in conformity with the highest industry practices and standards. The main general objective will&#13;
be the timely completion of the proposed project in an efficient manner, taking into account the local circum-&#13;
stances and conditions. A related objective of the consultancy is to assist Azerigaz in developing its capacity&#13;
to plan and implement future investment projects.&#13;
SCOPE OF THE CONSULTANCY ASSIGNMENT&#13;
12.    The consultancy assignment would be undertaken in two phases, with the execution of the second&#13;
phase dependent both on the approval of the IDA credit for the proposed project and on the consultants'&#13;
satisfactory completion of the first phase. The first phase of the assignment would be financed under a&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) which would cover activities through to the point of credit effectiveness&#13;
(currently estimated as December 31, 1996).&#13;
Phase I&#13;
The objectives of the first (PPF) phase of the assignment will be to advance the procurement of&#13;
equipment to upgrade gas measurement capability at major City Gate Stations (CGS) in the Apsheron&#13;
Peninsula, to continue preparation of specifications and bidding documents for the remaining subcomponents&#13;
of the metering program, and to undertake minor items of procurement including the acquisition of leak&#13;
detection equipment and basic office equipment for the operation of the Project Implement Unit (PIU). It is&#13;
envisioned that this assignment will be undertaken by two or three specialists, operating on a short term basis&#13;
in Azerbaijan. Activities undertaken in this Phase are not expected to include any activities related to&#13;
mobilization for the second phase of the assignment. Specifically, the activities to be covered under Phase I&#13;

Consultant's assignment. A coordinating committee will be established by Azerigaz. The representatives of&#13;
other Azerbaijan agencies, such as Azeri State Standard, SOCAR or the World Bank would be invited to join&#13;
this committee whenever required. The committee would meet on a regular basis and/or as to be invited by&#13;
PIU.&#13;
22.    The Consultant will closely cooperate with Azerigaz's representatives in charge of the PIU, who will&#13;
render the necessary assistance to the Consultant in carrying out his assignment. The Consultant will provide&#13;
the PIU with all the necessary advice, including but not necessarily limited to the items in this TOR, for a suc-&#13;
cessful implementation of the project. It is understood that the PIU Manager will give/receive and the&#13;
Consultant will promptly provide all such advice in time; and also, in order to enable the Consultant to be&#13;

held responsible for the assignment, the Manager will normally act upon the advice on time. Generally, the&#13;
Consultant will keep the Manager continuously informed upon progress of the work, particularly with refer-&#13;
ence to problems that could cause delays or technical and financial difficulties.&#13;
23.    The Consultant is required to submit to PIU Manager the following reports in 10 copies both in&#13;
Russian and English:&#13;
a)    Monthly report by the I 0th of each month, summarizing the activities of the previous month,&#13;
cost vs budget, any issues and recommendations; two copies of this report will be directly sent to the&#13;
World Bank for review and comments.&#13;
b)    Design, specifications and cost estimates for the metering and regulating stations.&#13;
c)    Diagnostic report following the cathodic protection assessment, implementation of the pilot&#13;
project as well as cost estimate and implementation program for pipeline system upgrade.&#13;
d)    Design, specifications and cost estimate for the quality control laboratory including the&#13;
equipment.&#13;
e)    Proposed training program and operation and maintenance manuals.&#13;
f)    Commissioning reports.&#13;
g)    The final report summarizing the project design, final cost, reference list of all drawings and&#13;
any lessons to be learned from the project implementation.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN GAS SYSTEM REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL RATES OF RETURN&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
1.    Financial internal rates of return were calculated for the project as a whole and for each of&#13;
the investment components. Capital costs and investment cash flows were based on the total cost&#13;
estimate and implementation schedule discussed in Annexes 3.1 and 4.2, excluding physical and&#13;
price contingencies. For purposes of the analysis, investments in cathodic protection and testing&#13;
equipment were combined under the heading of "asset preservation".&#13;
2.    Assumptions regarding the impacts of each of the project components (including both&#13;
incremental costs and benefits) are summarized in Table 1. Savings in gas losses were valued at&#13;
the price of gas imports from Turkmenistan, on the premise that imports represent the marginal&#13;
source of supply. In the absence of a long-term take-or-pay purchase contract with&#13;
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan should be able to limit imports on a year-round basis. Even if domestic&#13;
gas supply exceeds demand during the summer period, surplus can be injected into storage to&#13;
reduce the need for winter imports. Costs associated with lost margins as a result of customer&#13;
responses to more accurate metering (and hence higher gas bills) were valued at the margin&#13;
between the current selling price and the cost of imported gas. In the case of industrial metering,&#13;
the lost margins were based on industrial tariffs. For city gate instrumentation, where the&#13;
conservation impact will be spread over a broader range of customer classes, the difference&#13;
between the weighted average selling price and the cost of imports was used to value lost&#13;
margins. In this instance, however, because residential and communal prices are both below the&#13;
import cost, the weighted average margins are negative.&#13;
3.    All impacts were measured over a 20 year life, from 2001 when the project is fully&#13;
implemented through 2020. Both FIRR's and NPV's were calculated, the latter based on a&#13;
financial opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. The opportunity cost used is equivalent to the&#13;
current short term, foreign currency lending rate. Because the capital markets in Azerbaijan are&#13;
shallow and poorly developed, longer term money is not available. Income taxes of 35 percent&#13;
were applied to net incremental income.&#13;
Summary of Findings&#13;
4.    Tables 3 through 7 show the detailed cash flow statements and results for the base case&#13;
analysis. The results are summarized in Table 2.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN GAS SYSTEM REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
PRO FORMA FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
1.    The following tables present pro forma financial statements for Azerigaz for the years&#13;
1995 through 2003. The projections assume that the project is implemented in accordance&#13;
with the cost estimate given in Chapter 3 and the schedule outlined in Chapter 4. The&#13;
projections also assume that Azerigaz will undertake non-project related capital investments&#13;
including: (a) acquisition of new compressors from the Ukraine ($3 million in each of 1996&#13;
and 1997); (b) purchase of additional residential meters from China (approximately $5 million&#13;
per year from 1996 through 1999); and (c) continued replacement of older pipes throughout&#13;
the system (approximately $35 million per year).&#13;
2.    The projections also assume that Azerigaz will earn a positive margin averaging&#13;
$4.00/MCM on its gas sales, beginning in 1996, and will maintain that margin in real terms&#13;
thereafter. However, while this will provide sufficient funds to finance the project-related&#13;
investments, it is not sufficient to allow for the full capital investment program described&#13;
above. In order to meet these investment plans, Azerigaz will have to charge higher margins&#13;
in the future and/or improve the efficiency of its operations. Hence, Azerigaz will be&#13;
required, under the credit agreement, to prepare an annual business plan satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank which demonstrates how they propose to meet their financial obligations for the coming&#13;
year. In addition, Azerigaz would be required to obtain prior clearance from the Bank before&#13;
undertaking capital investments which are not related to the project.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN GAS SYSTEM REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS - CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS&#13;
1.    The following tables address the sensitivity of the cash flow and other financial&#13;
projections to the possibility that the Government will decide to maintain indefinitely their&#13;
current policy of disallowing gas imports. As with the pro forma financial statements&#13;
presented in the Base Case (Annex 5.2), the projections are based on the assumption that the&#13;
project is implemented in accordance with the cost estimate given in Chapter 3 and the&#13;
schedule outlined in Chapter 4. The projections also assume that Azerigaz will undertake non-&#13;
project related capital investments including: (a) acquisition of new compressors from the&#13;
Ukraine ($3 million in each of 1996 and 1997); (b) purchase of additional residential meters&#13;
from China (approximately $5 million per year from 1996 through 1999); and (c) continued&#13;
replacement of older pipes throughout the system (approximately $35 million per year).&#13;
2.    The sensitivity analysis further assumes that: (i) gas imports are not resumed; (ii) gas&#13;
supply from domestic fields declines in line with the projections shown in Table 2.1; (iii) supply&#13;
shortfalls are spread over all customer classes in proportion to their demand; (iv) prices to&#13;
consumers would be held constant in real terms, apart from the doubling of residential prices&#13;
required prior to credit negotiations; and (v) a minimum $4.00/MCM (1996 price levels) average&#13;
margin would be maintained.&#13;
3.    The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that, at least in the short term, Azerigaz is in a&#13;
moderately better financial position as a result of continued curtailment of imports, provided that&#13;
current purchase and selling prices are maintained in real terms, and that the curtailment in supply&#13;
is spread proportionately across all customer classes. If, however, as a result of political or social&#13;
considerations, curtailments are focussed on industrial customers in order to maintain supply to&#13;
residential and communal customers, there would be a rapid deterioration in Azerigaz's average&#13;
margin at current prices. Furthermore, unless domestic production could be maintained at or near&#13;
current levels, the curtailment of imports would entail as much as a 50 percent drop in Azerigaz's&#13;
sales, and the company would be unable to cover its full operating costs even with a $4.00/MCM&#13;
average margin.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN GAS SYSTEM REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Costs&#13;
1.    The costs of the project are taken as being the financial costs. In the case of the foreign&#13;
cost component, this reflects the cost of equipment and implementation services procured&#13;
competitively on the international market, and is thus representative of opportunity cost. In the&#13;
case of local cost, much of the cost is for services provided by Azerigaz and local contractors.&#13;
Since these services are labor intensive and since there may be little alternative employment for&#13;
these resources elsewhere in the economy, it could be argued that the services should be priced at&#13;
below their financial cost. However, no adjustment has been made, both because of the relatively&#13;
modest proportion of local costs in the total project cost, and in the interests of maintaining a&#13;
straightforward and conservative economic evaluation.&#13;
B. Benefits&#13;
2.    The project yields a number of benefit streams, including:&#13;
(a)   Savings on future expenditure on pipeline replacement due to the extension of the&#13;
useful life of pipelines through rehabilitation of the cathodic protection system;&#13;
(b)   Reduced gas use as customers who have new, or more effective, meters installed&#13;
are given an incentive to use gas more efficiently; and&#13;
(c)   Reduced gas leakage due to improvement in average pipeline quality, replacement&#13;
of damaged and corroded pipe and improved leak detection and gas quantity&#13;
accounting.&#13;
3.    All of these benefits are evaluated against a "counter-factual" (or "without project") case&#13;
in which no investments are made. The nature of the project is such that alternative cases of other&#13;
investments, or intermediate variants, are not easily applicable. It should also be noted that the&#13;
project implementation process will involve many micro-decisions on specific investments, for&#13;
cathodic protection of particular stretches of pipeline, and for replacement of individual meters.&#13;
Screening procedures will ensure that only investments which meet certain basic criteria of&#13;
viability will be made (eg. only pipelines which will continue in use will be cathodically protected,&#13;
and meters will be installed only at premises likely to continue to use gas). In this sense, it is likely&#13;
that the final investment pattern will be somewhat different than currently assumed but will have&#13;
an element of self-correction away from sub-optimal outcomes.&#13;
4.    Economic Value of Natural Gas: The economic value of natural gas is taken to be fuel&#13;
oil parity. The economic value of fuel oil, fob Baku, is taken as $50/ton, based upon a&#13;
Mediterranean price for low sulphur fuel oil of $1 1 0/ton and transport costs from Baku to the&#13;
Mediterranean (by rail and ship via a Black Sea port) of $60 /ton. The equivalent value of gas is&#13;
taken as $45/MCM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 6.1&#13;
Page 2&#13;
5.    In the short run, it could be argued that the economic value of gas should be based upon&#13;
the cost of gas imports from Turkmenistan. At the margin, under present circumstances,&#13;
additional gas made available through more efficient usage would probably reduce the need for&#13;
gas imports. However, it is difficult to estimate a realistic economic value for such imports, since&#13;
these are paid for largely in barter goods. In addition, in the medium term and long term (during&#13;
which project benefits accrue), Azerbaijan's gas production is expected to stabilize and then&#13;
recover. In this case, gas imports may be eliminated and gas will compete with fuel oil in the&#13;
substitutable power market (which is currently using mostly fuel oil). Hence fuel oil parity&#13;
represents the most useful benchmark for economic valuation of gas in Azerbaijan.&#13;
6.    Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR): The EIRR of the project under base case&#13;
assumptions (outlined below) is relatively high, at 46.9%. It should be noted that the calculation&#13;
of the project EIRR includes allowance for the cost of Implementation Assistance ($1.3 million),&#13;
which is not included under the individual components below.&#13;
C. Evaluation of Benefits by Major Component&#13;
7.      Asset Preservation: The EIRR of this component is estimated at 53.4% under base&#13;
case assumptions. It is assumed that 2,600 kilometers of pipe will be protected through&#13;
rehabilitated cathodic protection systems, with unit replacement cost of $273,000/km. With&#13;
improved cathodic protection, remaining average lifetimes of pipelines are estimated to be&#13;
extended from 20 years to 40 years. The average proportion of pipeline replaced each year thus&#13;
decreases progressively from 5% at the start of the project, to 2.5% after 15 years.&#13;
8.    Additional benefits from this component come from savings in electricity costs, as stray&#13;
currents and losses are eliminated and a reduction in gas leakage due to improved pipe quality.&#13;
However, these savings are small in relation to those yielded by the reduced spending on pipe&#13;
replacement.&#13;
9.    New Gas Meters: The EIRR of this component is estimated at 43.0%. Introduction of&#13;
meters for consumers who are currently not metered is assumed to provide a strong inducement&#13;
to use gas more efficiently. It is expected also that the general environment in Azerbaijan will&#13;
move towards increased effectiveness of market mechanisms (through privatization, creation of&#13;
hard budget constraints and increased management autonomy). It is assumed that the efficiency of&#13;
gas use is improved by 15% three years after meters are installed. This is a fairly conservative&#13;
assumption, since it is often observed that introduction of meters can lead to improvements in gas&#13;
efficiency of 25% or more.&#13;
10.   However, it should be noted that the improvement in gas use efficiency will entail some&#13;
burden for consumers, who previously did not have to concern themselves with the quantity of&#13;
gas used. Improved efficiency of use among these consumers will mostly take the form of simple&#13;
behavioral and operational changes (turning off gas using equipment when not in use, adjusting&#13;
temperature of heaters, calibrating equipment). However, there is in principle a cost perceived by&#13;
consumers in the form of lost "consumer surplus", since the previous availability of gas at zero&#13;
marginal cost presumably generated a certain level of convenience which was of some value to the&#13;
users. In the case of a normal price increase, it can be argued that a part (up to half) of the value&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
Annex 6.1&#13;
Page 3&#13;
of the reduction in gas usage (at the new higher price), should be counted as a loss of consumer&#13;
surplus (this corresponds to the area under the demand curve). However, in this case this would&#13;
probably overstate the loss, since consumers were probably not operating on any meaningful&#13;
demand curve due to the effects of the previous non-market planning system. Moreover, a&#13;
substantial part of gas use represents pure "waste", the reduction of which does not correspond to&#13;
any significant loss of welfare to the consumer (such as turning off appliances when these are not&#13;
needed). Hence in the evaluation, a 25% reduction in the value of gas saved has been taken to&#13;
represent the loss of consumer surplus associated with introduction of gas meters, or with more&#13;
effective metering (which raises metered gas costs).&#13;
11.   Replacement Gas Meters: This component yields an EIRR of 2 .1%. The evaluation of&#13;
the benefits from this component consists of two separate items:&#13;
(a)   Many of the meters currently installed are not working properly, or are completely&#13;
non-functional. The proportion of such meters is believed to be at least 10%, based&#13;
upon selected site inspections. In these cases gas usage is based upon norms or&#13;
negotiations between Azerigaz and the customer, rather than on metered usage. In&#13;
this case, installation of a replacement meter has much the same effect as&#13;
installation of a new meter, and the benefits are measured as described for "New&#13;
Meters". The total reduction in gas use will be about 1.5% within three years (i.e.&#13;
15% of 10%).&#13;
(b)   Meters are estimated to be under-reading consumption by about 10% on average&#13;
due to a lack of temperature and pressure compensation systems. Hence&#13;
replacement of these meters with new meters will lead to a rise of approximately&#13;
10% in the customers' gas bill. As in the case of new meters, customers are&#13;
assumed to reduce consumption by 0. 15% for each 1.0% rise in gas prices, and&#13;
total gas consumption is expected to fall by about 1.5% within three years of&#13;
introduction of replacement meters.&#13;
12.     As in the case of new meters, the economic benefit from the reduction in gas use is&#13;
offset by a loss of consumer surplus (of 25% of the total), as consumers are burdened with the&#13;
inconvenience of higher gas costs. However, the above estimate also underestimates the benefits&#13;
to some extent, since it does not quantify the savings of gas that would result from elimination of&#13;
gas theft through meter tampering, as tamper-proof meters replace current obsolete models. Such&#13;
a reduction in theft will show up not only as a reduction in "non-technical" losses to the gas&#13;
company, but will also induce a cut-back in gas consumption. Much of the gas used "free" when&#13;
stolen will probably not be used at all when consumers are forced to pay for it. However, it is&#13;
difficult to quantify this effect.&#13;
13.   City Gate Instrumentation: This component has an EIRR of 74.3%. This relatively high&#13;
rate of return is based upon the fact that while the cost of the component is relatively low ($2.4&#13;
million), it affects all of the gas used in Azerbaijan (since all gas flows through city gate stations).&#13;
The economic benefits result from the reduction of gas use following upon introduction of&#13;
effective city gate metering. At present, it is estimated by Azerigaz that a significant proportion of&#13;
non-technical losses take the form of theft of gas through tampering with city-gate station meters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
Annex 6.1&#13;
Page 4&#13;
The elimination of this theft will have a large effect on gas use, since the gas which was stolen is&#13;
presumably used very inefficiently. Once consumers have to pay for this gas its use will be&#13;
curtailed sharply. Overall reduction in gas use is estimated at 1.5%.&#13;
D. Risk Analysis&#13;
14.   The main factors which could lead to lower economic returns to the project are:&#13;
(a)   Possible lower benefits from cathodic protection, due to the condition of current&#13;
pipelines being poorer than expected, or due to unexpected technical factors (eg.&#13;
soil characteristics);&#13;
(b)   Possible lower demand response (improvement in efficiency) following&#13;
introduction of new and replacement meters;&#13;
(c)   Lower benefits from savings of gas due to lower international fuel oil prices (or a&#13;
future surplus of gas in Azerbaijan as large gas deposits are developed more&#13;
rapidly than anticipated),&#13;
(d)   Higher capital costs than assumed.&#13;
15.   The results of various sensitivities on these parameters is shown in Table 2. It can be seen&#13;
that the project EIRR is extremely robust to a variety of adverse assumptions. A case has also&#13;
been run in which all the "downside" assumptions have been combined. Even in this case the&#13;
overall Project EIRR remains satisfactory, at 23.0 %.&#13;
16.   Switching values for the key variables are fairly extreme. The overall EIRR of the Project&#13;
falls below 12% only when capital costs exceed the base case figure by a factor of 6.6 (ie. costs&#13;
are 660% of the base case figure). For gas prices, key components fall below 12% only at gas&#13;
prices under $1 0/mcm. Demand response can be 4 times less than estimated (ie. 25% of the base&#13;
case), with the project still yielding over 12%.&#13;
17.   The component with the lowest rate of return, and which is hence most vulnerable to&#13;
unfavorable developments in project variables, is the Replacement Metering component. In a&#13;
technical sense, it is possible to separate this component and to carry out only the other&#13;
components which have a higher return. However, it should be noted that it is not practical or&#13;
desirable to eliminate or greatly curtail this component, because: (a) it would be undesirable to&#13;
create two classes of consumers, those with accurate new meters, and those with unreliable&#13;
"Soviet-era" meters, since the latter would continue to dispute their bills, while the former will&#13;
feel that they are paying for the non-technical losses of the latter; and (b) the maintenance of many&#13;
inaccurate meters will impede the overall goal of creating a full gas accounting system for&#13;
Azerbaijan with consequent benefits in terms of network management and efficiency.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The principal objectives of the Gas
            System Rehabilitation Project are to: 1) promote more
            efficient use of gas and reduce non-technical losses by
            replacing obsolete and inaccurate metering, improving
            measurement instrumentation, installing meters where none
            presently exist, and establishing associated meter proving
            facilities; 2) improve the physical accounting for gas and
            encourage an improved commercial basis for gas trading
            through the upgrading of metering and instrumentation; 3)
            ensure the efficient operation and preserve the value of the
            existing pipeline assets through investments in cathodic
            protection, gas analysis and leak detection equipment; and
            4) support the commercialization of Azerigaz and further
            development of the sector through technical assistance,
            training programs and the acquisition of modern office
            equipment. The project is divided into four main components:
            1) metering, which includes the rehabilitation of the city
            gate meter stations, the installation/replacement of meters,
            and the purchase of meter proving equipment; 2) cathodic
            protection system rehabilitation; 3) analytical equipment
            including gas quality test equipment, leak detection
            equipment, and computer software and hardware to undertake
            network modeling; and 4) corporatization support involving
            assistance in project implementation, training of Azerigaz
            staff and upgrading of office equipment.
