Category (3) is governed by the provisions of paragraph 9 of this Annex. The Bank will engage&#13;
one or more Monitoring Agents to monitor expenditures related to the activities financed under&#13;
Categories (1), (2) and (3). Each Monitoring Agent will be selected and retained by the Bank on&#13;
the basis of terms of reference/scope of work agreed by the Management Committee and the&#13;
Bank. The responsibilities of each Monitoring Agent will include monitoring the procurement of&#13;
goods, services and other items, screening and recommending withdrawal applications for the&#13;
Bank's approval and payment, monitoring all expenditures financed by the Grant Funds and pre-&#13;
screening the financial management capacity of potential Sub-grant Recipients so as to ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-8-&#13;
that Grant Funds are disbursed only for the purposes specified in paragraph 4 of this Annex and&#13;
according to applicable Bank procedures.&#13;
(b)    Monitoring Agents will report to the Bank. Subject to the approval of the&#13;
Management Committee, the Bank will have the authority to change the terms of reference/scope&#13;
of work of each Monitoring Agent and, where justified, to replace each Monitoring Agent with&#13;
another firm or agency. The Bank will give advance notice to the Administration, the&#13;
Management Committee and the Donors of changes to the terms of reference/scope of work of&#13;
each Monitoring Agent. The Bank will perform ex-post evaluations of the activities undertaken&#13;
by the Monitoring Agents, and will, upon completion of the activities financed under the Trust&#13;
Fund, arrange for an independent review of the performance of the Monitoring Agents and report&#13;
its findings to the Donors.&#13;
(c)    The Grant Funds may be used by the Bank to: (i) pay the reasonable fees, travel&#13;
and other reimbursable costs of Monitoring Agents; and (ii) pay the cost of goods, services and&#13;
other items of expenditure in furtherance of the Trust Fund activities, all in accordance with the&#13;

procurement and financing of expenditures for goods and services to be carried out by the&#13;
Administration, in connection with goods and services financed under Categories (1) and (2), and&#13;
by each Monitoring Agent, will take place on an untied basis, in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" and the "Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency".&#13;
7.     The Bank's Use of Grant Funds and Administrative Cost Recovery&#13;
(a)    The Grant Funds will be accounted for as part of a single Trust Fund which will&#13;
be kept separate and apart from other funds of the Bank. Donor contributions to the Trust Fund&#13;
may not be earmarked for one or more specific Categories and will instead be allocated among all&#13;
Categories in accordance with the decisions of the Management Committee. A Donor may state a&#13;
preference that its contribution be used to finance one or more Categories, or certain activities in&#13;
a given sector, with the understanding that neither the Management Committee nor the Bank will&#13;
be in a position to guarantee that total spending with respect to any given Category or sector will&#13;
match or exceed the level of the contribution in connection with which a preference will have&#13;
been stated. Undesignated contributions will be allocated among Categories in accordance with&#13;
the decisions of the Management Committee. No contribution to the Trust Fund will be accepted&#13;
unless it equals or exceeds two hundred thousand United States dollars (US$200,000).&#13;
(b)    The Bank may invest the Grant Funds pending disbursement in any instrument in&#13;
which the Bank is authorized to invest its own funds. The investment income earned on the Grant&#13;
Funds pending disbursement will be added to the account to be used for purposes of the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
(c)    In order to assist in the defrayment of its administrative costs, the Bank may, as&#13;
of February 18, 2011 following deposit of the Grant Funds, deduct from the T-Account and&#13;
transfer to itself an amount equivalent to two percent (2.0%) of the amount of the Grant Funds.&#13;
The Bank may also deduct from the T-Account and transfer to itself the actual costs of the Bank's&#13;
contract with the Monitoring Agent(s), as well as the cost of the independent review of the&#13;
Monitoring Agent(s)'s performance referred to under paragraph 6(b) of this Annex.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-9-&#13;
8.     Fiduciary Responsibilities of the Bank&#13;
(a)    The Bank will be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set&#13;
forth in this Letter Agreement, including this Annex, and will not be subject to any other duties or&#13;
responsibilities to Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might&#13;
otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law.&#13;
Nothing in this Letter Agreement will be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of&#13;
the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly&#13;
reserved. The Bank will have no responsibility to Donors with respect to the performance of the&#13;
Monitoring Agent(s) and will have no obligation to reimburse the Trust Fund or provide any&#13;
compensation to any Donor if the Grant Funds are not disbursed for the purposes specified in this&#13;
Annex as a result of actions of the Monitoring Agent(s).&#13;
(b)    Unless otherwise provided in this Letter Agreement, the Bank will apply its&#13;
normal financial management procedures to the Trust Fund. Such procedures applicable to the&#13;
operation of the Trust Fund will be communicated to the Donors without delay.&#13;
(c)    Unless otherwise provided in this Letter Agreement, the Bank will apply to the&#13;
Trust Fund its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening&#13;
procedures to prevent the use of bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the&#13;
Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council, taken under&#13;
Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The Donor acknowledges that this provision&#13;
does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control&#13;
laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to&#13;
the Donor, nor will it be deemed a waiver, express or implied, of any of the privileges and&#13;
immunities of the Bank.&#13;
9.     Terms and Conditions Governing Sub-Grants under Category (3)&#13;
In the event that the Bank deems it necessary execute a sub-grant to carry out an&#13;
Investment and Program Activity eligible for financing under Category (3), the following&#13;
provisions will apply:&#13;
(a)    The Bank will conclude a Sub-grant Agreement with each "Sub-grant Recipient".&#13;
(b)    Except as provided in paragraph (c) below, responsibility for the accounting and&#13;
administration of Grant Funds made available by the Bank to Sub-grant Recipients will be&#13;
decided upon on a case-by-case basis by the Management Committee, considering, inter alia, the&#13;
recommendations made by the Monitoring Agent(s). Accordingly, the Management Committee&#13;
will review proposals to carry out activities eligible for financing under Category (3) and award&#13;
Sub-grants in connection with proposals deemed by the Management Committee to be suitable&#13;
for financing and consistent with the Financing Strategy. Proposals for financing under Category&#13;
(3) will be submitted for approval to the Administration which, when approved, will forward&#13;
them to the Management Committee for consideration.  Only proposals vetted by the&#13;
Administration in the manner described in this sub-paragraph will be considered by the&#13;
Management Committee. A proposal submitted to the Management Committee, through the&#13;
Administration, will include an appraisal of the Investment and Program Activity sought to be&#13;
financed. For those proposals that do not include an appraisal of the Investment Project sought to&#13;
be financed, the Bank will carry out the appraisal of the Investment Project. The representative of&#13;
a member organization of the Management Committee will recuse him or herself from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-10-&#13;
deliberations over the suitability of proposal(s) submitted or co-financed by the organization that&#13;
he or she represents.&#13;
(c)    Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph 9,&#13;
proposals to carry out a Law and Order Project may only be made and carried out by the United&#13;
Nations Development Programme. The latter will be the sole organization authorized to carry out&#13;
Law and Order Projects financed hereunder. Sub-grants to finance Law and Order Projects will&#13;
be made in accordance with terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank including, without&#13;
limitation, those set forth in sub-paragraphs (a), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this paragraph 9 whose&#13;
provisions shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any Sub-grant made or to be made by the Bank to the&#13;
United Nations Development Programme for purposes of carrying out a Law and Order Project.&#13;
UNDP, the Bank and the Management Committee will agree on detailed procedures including&#13;
procurement, disbursements and audits for processing Law and Order Projects.&#13;
(d)    Sub-grants will be used to finance expenditures for goods, works and services, as&#13;
the case may be, in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits" and the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and&#13;
by the World Bank as Executing Agency", as in effect at the date of the relevant Sub-grant&#13;
agreement (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Bank's Guidelines"). Any departure from&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines will have to be pre-approved by the Bank.&#13;
(e)    The fiduciary arrangements for an Investment and Program Activity to be&#13;
financed under Category (3) will be carried out in accordance with the guidelines and procedures&#13;
specified in paragraph 8 (b) including but not limited to an environmental and social screening&#13;
and assessment framework approved by the Bank. Any departure from the guidelines contained&#13;
in said framework will have to be pre-approved by the Bank.&#13;

financial management system, including records and accounts, and prepare financial statements&#13;
adequate to separately reflect the operations, resources and expenditures related to the Investment&#13;
and Program Activity financed under the Sub-grant. Within ninety (90) days of each June 30 and&#13;
December 31, the Sub-grant Recipient will prepare unaudited financial statements with respect to&#13;
such Sub-grant and forward a copy to the Bank. All financial statements appropriate to the size&#13;
and purpose of the Sub-grant, as indicated in the Sub-grant agreement will be expressed in the&#13;
currency in which the Sub-grant is made, as indicated in the Sub-grant Agreement, and will show&#13;
the allocation of such funds among the activities financed by the Sub-grant. In addition, the Sub-&#13;
grant Recipient will: (i) have the above-mentioned records, accounts and financial statements&#13;
audited, in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to the Bank, by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank; (ii) furnish to the Bank, as soon as available, but in any case not later than&#13;
six (6) months after the end of each calendar year: (a) certified copies of the financial statements&#13;

accounts and report of such audit, by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank&#13;
will have reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the Bank such other information concerning&#13;
said records and accounts, and the audit thereof, as the Bank will from time to time reasonably&#13;
request. In such cases where the Sub-grant is &lt; US$100,000 the Bank has the discretion to&#13;
specify in the Sub-grant agreement that attestation from the Monitoring Agent will be sufficient&#13;
to comply with the audit procedures above.&#13;
(g)    The Bank will report quarterly to the Donors on the status of Trust Funds made&#13;
available to a Sub-grant Recipient under a Sub-grant Agreement. In addition, at a Donor's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 11 -&#13;
request, the Bank will also make available, in accordance with its Policy on Access to&#13;
Information, audited and unaudited financial statements of Sub-grant Recipients furnished under&#13;
paragraph (f), above.&#13;
10.    Accountin2 and Financial Reporting Responsibilities of the Bank&#13;
(a)    The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the&#13;
aggregate Grant Funds for the agreed activities and disbursements made therefrom to the&#13;
Monitoring Agent(s). Within one hundred eighty (180) days of the completion of the activities&#13;
financed by the Grant Funds, the Bank will prepare unaudited financial statements in United&#13;
States dollars with respect to the Grant Funds and forward a copy to each Donor. The Bank will&#13;
provide the Donors annually with a management assertion together with an attestation from the&#13;
Bank's external auditors on the satisfactory performance of the procedures and controls used by&#13;
the Bank in administering the Grant Funds.&#13;
(b)    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit&#13;
by the Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to&#13;
whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the&#13;
appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and&#13;
terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit,&#13;
including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be paid by the requesting&#13;
Donor.&#13;
11.    Progress Reporting Responsibilities of the Bank&#13;
(a)    The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the Donors.&#13;
The Bank will provide each Donor with quarterly reports on its quarterly ex-post evaluation of&#13;
the activities undertaken by the Monitoring Agent(s) including disbursements made out of the&#13;
Grant Funds. Within (6) six months of the completion of the activities, or of full disbursement of&#13;
the Grant Funds, whichever comes later, the Bank will provide a final progress report to each&#13;
Donor, together with a copy of the independent review of the performance of the Monitoring&#13;
Agent(s). Upon request by any Donor, the Bank will send to such Donor the draft and final&#13;
reports received by the Bank from each Monitoring Agent on the activities financed by the Grant&#13;
Funds.&#13;
(b)    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund. The&#13;
Donor and the Bank shall agree on the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation and the&#13;
Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of its policies and procedures. All&#13;
associated costs shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation&#13;
will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund and will be separate&#13;
from any independent evaluation of the Trust Fund to be arranged by the Bank.&#13;
12.    Termination&#13;
Unless otherwise agreed by the Donors and the Bank, the Trust Fund arrangement provided for&#13;
under the Letter Agreement and this Annex will expire on June 30, 2020. If at any time, either&#13;
party determines that the purposes of the Letter Agreement and this Annex can no longer be&#13;
effectively or appropriately carried out, this Letter Agreement may be terminated at the initiative&#13;
of either party by giving the other party thirty (30) days prior notice to this affect. Upon&#13;
termination, unless otherwise agreed by the Donors and the Bank: (i) any agreement entered into&#13;
among the Bank, the Monitoring Agent(s), and/or other third parties will not be affected by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 12-&#13;
termination, and the Bank will be entitled to continue permitting withdrawals of Grant Funds in&#13;
respect of such agreements as if this arrangement had not been so terminated; and (ii) any&#13;
remaining Grant Funds will be returned to the Donors on a pro-rata basis, and the Bank's&#13;
functions pursuant hereto will be considered terminated. Within six (6) months following such&#13;
termination, the Bank will furnish to the Donors an unaudited financial statement with respect to&#13;
the aggregate amount contributed by all Donors.&#13;
13.    Legal Documentation&#13;
For purposes of channeling Grant Funds to their intended beneficiaries in accordance the terms&#13;
and conditions of the Letter Agreement and this Annex, the Bank will enter into a grant&#13;
agreement with the Administration concerning Trust Funds allocated to Categories (1) and (2).&#13;
Grant Funds allocated to Category (3) will be governed by separate sub-grant agreements to be&#13;
entered into between the Bank, on the one part, and sub-grant Recipients, on the other part, with&#13;
each such agreement relating to one or more Investment and Program Activity. Without&#13;
prejudice to the foregoing, Grant Funds allocated to Category (3) for the specific purpose of&#13;
financing Law and Order Projects will be governed by one or more grant agreements, as the case&#13;
may be, to be entered into between the Bank, on the one part, and the United Nations&#13;
Development Programme, on the other part.&#13;
