&amp;#12;    Box I: National Consultations Workshop: Context and objectives&#13;
&#13;
    The National Consultations Workshop on Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) was organized in December 2009, jointly by&#13;
    the Ministry of Urban Development and the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), for sharing results of the data collected&#13;
    from the SLB pilot cities and for identifying actionable areas for improving performance.&#13;
&#13;
    The key objectives of the workshop included:&#13;
        Providing cities with an opportunity for presenting their own performance data and cross learning from experiences of&#13;
        other participating cities.&#13;
&#13;
        Discussing and clarifying issues relating to data quality, indicator definitions, and calculation methodology.&#13;
&#13;
        Introducing participants to key principles of Performance Improvement Planning and Information Systems Improvement&#13;
        Planning, including some early lessons.&#13;
&#13;
        Demonstrating international experiences in benchmarking to participants.&#13;
&#13;
        Providing case study experiences on improving water, sanitation, and solid waste services.&#13;
&#13;
        Outlining the institutionalization of SLB, including its scale up to the state level.&#13;
&#13;
    Over 150 participants, including water and sanitation (WSS) service providers and utility managers, water sector&#13;
    specialists, and city administrators attended the workshop. They represented different institutional contexts and&#13;
    WSS agencies, including state parastatals, municipal departments, municipal corporations, and water companies.&#13;
    A comprehensive list of the participants is presented in Appendix 2.&#13;
&#13;
    The workshop provided the cities a chance to reflect on their performance over four service areas, compare themselves to&#13;
    other cities, and identify their shortcomings and possible strategies to overcome them. It provided a further opportunity to&#13;
    clarify and validate the SLB data, and discuss support required to institutionalize benchmarking of performance data on an&#13;
    ongoing basis. (The agenda for the workshop is presented in Appendix 1.)&#13;
&#13;
    The deliberations were characterized by some important `firsts', namely:&#13;
&#13;
        Data were generated and analyzed using a uniform definitional framework articulated in the MoUD's Handbook on&#13;
        Service Level Benchmarking.2&#13;
&#13;
        The reliability of data was graded, as per the framework provided in the Handbook.&#13;
&#13;
        Cities identified potential Information Systems Improvement Plans (ISIPs) for addressing concerns on data reliability.&#13;
&#13;
        City officials (and not consultants) presented their own performance data, along with a performance gap analysis and&#13;
        improvement planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
 In 2006, a Core Group of senior experts was constituted under the chairmanship of the Joint Secretary, MoUD, for developing a Handbook on the common&#13;
benchmarking framework of standard performance parameters for the WSS sector. The Service Level Benchmarking Handbook, covering 28 performance indicators&#13;
across four sectors--water, sanitation, storm water drainage, and solid waste management--was disseminated to all states in September 2008. Besides setting out&#13;
guidelines on how to operationalize the framework in a phased manner, it also provided explanations and clarifications on the indicators, including the methodology to&#13;
be used for calculating them. It was expected that cities would adopt the framework for initiating service improvements. For more details refer to Handbook on&#13;

Heart of the Matter&#13;
Participants reflected positively upon&#13;
the SLB experience, since the data&#13;
collection enabled cities to undertake&#13;
an honest self appraisal of their&#13;
performance from a service point of&#13;
view. On completion of data collection,&#13;
city functionaries undertook a&#13;
performance gap analysis and,&#13;
based on the analysis, submitted&#13;
proposals to the MoUD for information&#13;
system improvements.&#13;
&#13;
To many, the exercise was an "eye&#13;
opener", since the exercise helped&#13;
compare themselves to their peers and&#13;
at the same time helped "set up goals&#13;
to achieve better performance". Many          Cities were, however, concerned about     move towards the service level&#13;
concurred that it was "a soul searching       their performance, especially since the   benchmarks over a period of time.&#13;
initiative for improvement of service         target benchmarks seemed very             Accordingly, the participating cities&#13;
delivery", "a knowledge experience in         ambitious. Cities were assured that       were encouraged to undertake&#13;
terms of getting to know indicators           while the SLB Handbook had set            this exercise on an ongoing&#13;
versus benchmarks", and that they had         ambitious targets, they could set         basis to deliver year on year&#13;
"found the goal to achieve the goal".         intermediate targets and gradually        performance improvements.&#13;

&amp;#12;End Note&#13;
The principle of accountability for&#13;
delivering certain service levels is now&#13;
gaining broad-based acceptance at all&#13;
levels in the country. The SLB initiative&#13;
has made an important contribution to&#13;
lending further momentum to this&#13;
process. The MoUD is now using the&#13;
benchmarking program to monitor and&#13;
evaluate delivery of improved urban&#13;
water and sanitation services, no longer&#13;
as ad hoc performance reviews, but&#13;
through a Government of India-led,&#13;
structured monitoring program that is&#13;
linked with the MoUD's reform agenda. It&#13;
is keen on incorporating this principle in&#13;
all its programs and initiatives including&#13;
the JNNURM, UIDSSMT, as well as&#13;
bilateral and multilateral programs.&#13;
&#13;
The MoUD is also committed to&#13;
providing necessary support to states&#13;
and cities that make an effort to&#13;
institutionalize the SLB framework in&#13;
their context. It has provided cities with&#13;
funding support to implement follow-up&#13;
actions under their ISIPs. Already, 13 of&#13;
the 28 pilot cities have submitted their&#13;
ISIP proposals, and Rs. 46 crore&#13;
(US$10.22 million) has been approved&#13;
by the MoUD for information systems&#13;
improvements. Some of the common&#13;
proposals across the cities include&#13;
household surveys to update customer&#13;
databases, installation of bulk flow&#13;
meters and pressure gauge systems,&#13;
installation of weighbridges, hydraulic&#13;
modeling on a pilot basis, and the           the 13th Finance Commission, which       the period 2010­15. It is hence&#13;

Last but not the least, the principle of     amounting to approximately               using the SLB framework to deliver&#13;

PARTNERSHIPS: This Think Tank was organized by the Water and Sanitation Program. The purpose was to provide opportunities for water supply&#13;
agencies in South Asia to learn from the experiences of water supply agencies that have succeeded in sustainably reducing their NRW levels. The&#13;
workshop objectives were to locate billing and collection within the broader framework of NRW, introduce all participants to successful practices from other&#13;
utilities in the region and globally, and catalyze further initiatives to reduce NRW among participating water utilities. (See Box I: National Consultations&#13;
Workshop: Context and objectives, for more details.)&#13;

            Improving water and sanitation service

            service level benchmarking
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The national consultations workshop on
            Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) was organized in December
            2009, jointly by the Ministry of Urban Development and the
            Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), for sharing results of
            the data collected from the SLB pilot cities and for
            identifying actionable areas for improving performance. The
            key objectives of the workshop includes: 1) providing cities
            with an opportunity for presenting their own performance
            data and cross learning from experiences of other
            participating cities; 2) discussing and clarifying issues
            relating to data quality, indicator definitions, and
            calculation methodology; 3) introducing participants to key
            principles of performance improvement planning and
            information systems improvement planning, including some
            early lessons; and 4) demonstrating international
            experiences in benchmarking to participants. The workshop
            provided the cities a chance to reflect on their performance
            over four service areas, compare themselves to other cities,
            and identify their shortcomings and possible strategies to
            overcome them. It provided a further opportunity to clarify
            and validate the SLB data, and discuss support required to
            institutionalize benchmarking of performance data on an
            ongoing basis.
