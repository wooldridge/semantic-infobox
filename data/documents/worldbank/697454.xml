UKRAINE&#13;
SEED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUiMMARY&#13;
Borrower:         Ukraine&#13;
Beneficiaries and&#13;
Executing Agencies: Private Seed Production Companies;&#13;
Regulatory Agencies of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MOAF);&#13;
and Institutes of the Ukrainian Academy of Agricultural Sciences (UAAS).&#13;
Loan Amount:      US $32.0 million&#13;
Terms:            Standard IBRD terms with 17 years maturity including five years of grace.&#13;
Onrending Terms:  Subloans to the seed production enterprises ($US 23.9 million, 75% of&#13;
Bank loan proceeds) would carry an interest rate spread that is 4.30&#13;
percentage points above the Bank's lending rate and would be repayable&#13;
in up to eleven years, including a maximum of four years of grace. Loan&#13;
funds benefitting public regulatory agencies, the UAAS and the Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) and technical assistance to the seed enterprises&#13;
would be passed on as budgetary allocations (25 % of Bank loan proceeds).&#13;
Objectives:       (a) Improvements in agricultural productivity and agricultural export&#13;
earnings through the supply of quality hybrid seeds for maize, sunflower&#13;
and sugarbeet; and (b) development of a competitive seed system through&#13;
privatization of seed production.&#13;
Description:      The proposed project would provide financing, technical assistance and&#13;
training for: (a) the development and initial operation of three private&#13;
hybrid seed production enterprises; (b) improvements in the regulatory&#13;
framework of the national seed system; and (c) the strengthening of the&#13;
germplasm maintenance and improvement.&#13;
Benefits:         The expected benefits from the seed production component would be the&#13;
demonstration of the viability of private seed production. The quality&#13;
hybrid seeds produced under the project would increase agricultural&#13;
productivity through lower seeding rates and higher yields. It would also&#13;
increase agricultural exports and/or substitute for imports. The improved&#13;
regulatory framework would facilitate the international competitiveness of&#13;
the Ukrainian seed system through improved plant breeders' rights, variety&#13;
registration and better access to foreign sources of germplasm. It would&#13;
also stimulate the development of a private seed industry. The germplasm&#13;
maintenance and improvement program would benefit domestic seed&#13;
breeding and, in so doing, assist domestic seed production and seed&#13;
exports in the medium and long term. The technical assistance for a study&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-iv-&#13;
of the agricultural research system would be a first step towards the&#13;
development of a sustainable agricultural research system.&#13;
Risks:            The main risks for meeting the project's objectives are: (a) limited local&#13;
experience in managing commercial seed production enterprises in a&#13;
market-oriented economy; (b) Government's propensity to "overregulate"&#13;
the domestic seed industry; and (c) the lack of experience in implementing&#13;
Bank supported projects on the part of all implementing entities. These&#13;
risks are worth taking in light of the robust financial and economic&#13;
benefits of the project. They would be minimized by obtaining assurance&#13;
from Government for establishing and maintaining a liberal pricing&#13;
marketing and trade system for seed; by providing technical assistance and&#13;
training for needed improvements in the seed regulatory framework; and&#13;
by establishing a PMU supported by technical assistance.&#13;
Environment:      In supporting the production of hybrid seeds, the project would provide&#13;
a type of agricultural input which would allow for substantial increase in&#13;
agricultural production and productivity without embarking on&#13;
environmentally taxing technologies. The potential occupational hazards&#13;
through the generation of dust and the handling of hazardous chemicals in&#13;
the project's seed plants would be mitigated by appropriate plant designs.&#13;

UKRAINE&#13;
SEED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1          With a land area of 0.6 million km2 and a population of 52 million, Ukraine is&#13;
the second largest country in Europe (after the Russian Federation), and the fifth largest in terms&#13;
of population. GNP per capita was estimated at US $1,912 for 1993 down from US $2,359 in&#13;
1992, and from US $2,635 in 1991.&#13;
1.2         Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. It now&#13;
faces the immense challenge of creating the institutions of a sovereign state, and at the same time&#13;
securing the transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. Until recently,&#13;
efforts at stabilization and structural reform have been piecemeal; under the newly elected&#13;
government, Ukraine's first comprehensive reform program has been formulated in an attempt&#13;
to deal with the critical issues of macroeconomic instability and restructuring of the economy,&#13;
including the acceleration of agricultural transformation.&#13;
B. Recent Economic Developments&#13;
1.3         The economic decline since independence has been dramatic. By the end of 1993,&#13;
the cumulative fall in real GDP since 1989 reached 40%. This trend accelerated in 1994:&#13;
officially recorded industrial output declined almost 40% in January-April compared with the&#13;
same period in 1993. The rate of inflation rose to almost 5,000% in 1993 up from 1,445% in&#13;
1992. In 1994, the inflation rate came down markedly, reaching 4 to 5% per month in the&#13;
second and third quarters, primarily on account of flagging demand, itself the result of a large&#13;
drop in real wages and a more stringent credit policy.&#13;
1.4         While external shocks, mostly brought on by the collapse of the former Soviet&#13;
Union (FSU), have contributed to the economic decline, so too have past policies of the&#13;
Government. Up until October 1994, Ukraine lacked a coherent macroeconomic stabilization&#13;
and structural reform program. The Government resorted to administrative measures to manage&#13;
the economy. Price controls (including fixed administered prices, advance notification of price&#13;
adjustments, and an array of controls on profit margins) were imposed; the state order system&#13;
controlled the flow of key commodities; the scope of export quotas and licenses was extensive;&#13;
and the compulsory surrender of foreign exchange earnings at exchange rates well below market&#13;
levels was enforced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                       Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
1.5          In his inaugural speech to Parliament on October 12, 1994, the President&#13;
announced Ukraine's first comprehensive economic reform program. This program has&#13;
stabilization aspects which aim to bring about a reduction in inflation by implementing tight&#13;
fiscal and monetary policies.  Structural reform  measures focus on promoting enterprise&#13;
restructuring and competition by: (a) removing the inhibiting role of the state towards the private&#13;
sector and letting markets function; (b) transforming state enterprises into commercial entities;&#13;
and (c) hardening the budget constraint on enterprises. Specific measures include the lifting of&#13;
most price controls, the unification of the exchange rate, the elimination of most export quotas,&#13;
a sharp reduction of subsidies on bread and public utilities, the adjustment of imported energy&#13;
prices to full cost recovery levels, as well as the implementation of a more targeted social safety&#13;
net. The package of policy and structural reforms should create a conducive environment for&#13;
implementing reforms and privatization in the agricultural and food sectors.&#13;
C. The Agriculture Sector'&#13;
1.6          Agriculture has historically been an important sector in the diversified Ukrainian&#13;
economy, together with a large industrial sector and a relatively small service sector. Currently,&#13;
agriculture contributes about 30% to Net Material Product (NMP), employs some 20% of the&#13;
labor force, and contributes approximately 30% to Ukraine's total merchandise trade. Given the&#13;
country's abundant natural resources, agriculture should continue to play a significant role in the&#13;
country's economic development.&#13;
Resources and Land Tenure&#13;
1.7          Out of Ukraine's total land area of 60.4 million ha, 41.9 million ha are classified&#13;
as agricultural land. Much of this land has highly productive deep black soil. Ukraine's climate&#13;
is mainly temperate, and it has a flat to moderately rolling topography, allowing large-scale&#13;
mechanized agricultural production systems. As of 1992, about 4.8 million people or about 20%&#13;
of the labor force were directly employed in agriculture. The size of the agricultural labor force&#13;
has declined over the last two decades both in terms of absolute numbers and in its share of the&#13;
total labor force. During the Soviet regime, agricultural land was operated under three basic&#13;
types of tenure: (a) centrally controlled collective farms, or kolkhozes, in which output and all&#13;
assets, except land, was jointly owned by the members; (b) centrally controlled state farms, or&#13;
sovkhozes, in which output and all assets were owned by the state; and (c) private "individual&#13;
subsidiary farms," consisting of household plots of kolkhoz or sovkhoz members, and gardens&#13;
and vegetable plots allocated to urban workers.&#13;
I     A detailed review of Ukraine's agriculture and current policy issues is presented in "UKRAINE-Food&#13;
and Agriculture Sector Review" June 30, 1994. Report No. 11880-UA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 1                                                                             3&#13;
1.8          Since independence in 1989, various forms of private land tenure have emerged,&#13;
and the structure of tenure continues to change. The total number of agricultural enterprises has&#13;
grown and continues to increase substantially, largely due to the entrance of 35,000 new&#13;
individual private farms and, to a lesser extent, the splitting of large collective farms into smaller&#13;
units. Agricultural land in individually managed private farms and household plots is currently&#13;
equivalent to about 13% of total farmland and contributes about one-third of Ukraine's&#13;
agricultural output.&#13;
Performance&#13;
1.9          Although agricultural production grew until the late 1980's at an average rate of&#13;
about 2 % per annum, factor productivities remained low, despite some of the best land resources&#13;
within the temperate climate zone. Crop yields and conversion factors in the livestock industry&#13;
are 25-50% lower than in developed countries with comparable resource endowments.&#13;
Inefficiencies in the system of central economic management and collective agriculture, along&#13;
with an increasingly outdated production technology, low-quality inputs (including seeds) and&#13;
a poorly performing agricultural marketing and processing system, prevented the sector from&#13;
realizing its high potential.&#13;
1.10         Agricultural  output&#13;
decreased by about 20% between&#13;
1990 and 1992 (Table 1.1). The&#13;
production of principal crops such           Table 1.1: Agriculture Production Development&#13;
as   cereals,  sugarbeets,  and                       (1%61970 = 100)&#13;
sunflowers, for example, declined                   1971/80  1980/90  1991  1992   1993&#13;
between 1986/90 and 1992/93 by   Total Agnculture    121      133    120   110   108&#13;
11%   percent, 28%, and  18%,   Public Enterprises    126     143    123   101    95&#13;
respectively.    Declines  in  the    Private Enterprises    108  114    114   128   135&#13;
population  and  production  of&#13;
livestock   were   even   higher,&#13;
reaching about 30% during that period.&#13;
1.11         With the decline in domestic production, the breakdown of the inter-republican&#13;
trade system, and the adoption of extensive trade restrictions, foreign trade in agricultural&#13;
products declined dramatically to a fraction of its pre-independence level. During the late&#13;
1980's, Ukraine exported some five million tons of grains, two million tons of dairy products,&#13;
and between three and four million tons of sugar. It also had been a significant exporter of&#13;
improved germplasm to the FSU and Eastern Europe. By 1993, these exports had declined by&#13;
more than 80%. During the same period, imports consisting mainly of feed grains declined by&#13;
about 50%.&#13;
1.12         This reduction in production and trade undermined the traditional role of&#13;
agriculture as a domestic source of food, employment, and export income. The decline also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                       Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
compromised agriculture's potential role in the reconstruction of the country's economy. In&#13;
addition, as a result of heavy subsidization of food consumers, agriculture became a growing&#13;
fiscal burden and a significant factor in macroeconomic destabilization.&#13;
Policies&#13;
1.13         Until recently, the Government of Ukraine made only small steps to reform&#13;
agriculture because the sector's problems were widely assumed to be transitory and surmountable&#13;
with greater access to advanced technology, better management, and temporary subsidies. The&#13;
Government also moved slowly because of the fear that rapid reforms could lead to a collapse&#13;
of production. However, macro-economic instability and the deterioration in 1993-94 of the&#13;
financial and organizational capacities of the public sector to substitute for market relations&#13;
between enterprises in the farm, input supply, and output marketing sectors made it clear that&#13;
profound liberalization and privatization in agriculture (as well as in the rest of the economy)&#13;
are essential for the country's economic recovery and development of agriculture.&#13;
1.14         The agricultural reform program  introduced by the current administration is&#13;
consistent with the recommendations made in the Bank's Food and Agricultural Sector Review&#13;
and meets the essential requirements for the viability of the proposed Seed Development Project.&#13;
Agricultural factor and product prices are being liberalized, state orders for agricultural produce&#13;
are to be discontinued, and the State will procure the goods it needs for its budgetary&#13;
organizations (ministries, armed forces, schools, hospitals, etc.) though competitive tender on&#13;
the market. Virtually all export quotas on agricultural products are being abolished.2 These&#13;
measures have been adopted in other sectors of the economy as well. The Seed Development&#13;
project would be the first vehicle for the Bank to support the implementation of these reform&#13;
measures in the agricultural sector.&#13;
D. National Seed System&#13;
Historical Background and Role&#13;
1.15         Ukraine has a long tradition in plant breeding and in supplying improved&#13;
germplasm to Western and Eastern Europe. Prior to World War I, most West European seed&#13;
breeders operated in Ukraine because the dry weather at harvest time helped produce seeds of&#13;
superior quality, compared with those in Western Europe. After 1917, Western involvement in&#13;
2      Temporary quotas are still in place on food wheat exports. In addition, discriminatory taxation&#13;
practices against private domestic and foreign trade enterprises are to be discontinued, infrastructure for&#13;
handling the flow of agricultural inputs and outputs are to be included in the country's privatization programs,&#13;
and land privatization and the establishment of a legal framework for the development of a land market are to&#13;
be accelerated.&#13;
&#13;

Chapter 1                                                                              5&#13;
Ukrainian seed production came to an end, and exports were only continued to the republics of&#13;
the Soviet Union, for which Ukraine became a major supplier of germplasm and foundation&#13;
seeds,3 especially for maize and sugarbeet seeds, and to a lesser extent for sunflower seeds.&#13;
Today, with the mounting economic difficulties since independence, plant breeding has suffered&#13;
significantly, the production of quality seed has declined, and with it the capacity to maintain&#13;
levels of crop production and exports of grains and seeds.&#13;
1.16         Seed is an important input for crop production for two reasons. First, it normally&#13;
represents about 10% of the variable production cost of crops, and second, the quality of the&#13;
seeds used determines decisively the productivity of crop production through seeding rates and&#13;
yields. Varietal improvements are generally estimated to have contributed 60% of the increase&#13;
in crop yields in Ukraine, which averaged about 1 to 2% per year. All crop producers in&#13;
Ukraine use improved seeds extensively. The percentage of crops planted with hybrid seed is&#13;
100% for maize, 40% for sunflower, and about 30% for sugarbeet. However, the physical and&#13;
genetic quality of both open-pollinating seed varieties and hybrids is mixed and to a large extent&#13;
responsible for the high seeding rates and relatively moderate yield levels prevailing in Ukrainian&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
1.17         The domestic seed system annually produced about 6-7 million tons of seeds for&#13;
grains, oilseeds, vegetables, and fodder crops. In addition, 5-6 million seed units (100,000 seeds&#13;
per unit) of sugarbeet seeds and 3.5 million tons of seed potatoes were produced. This met the&#13;
domestic demand for seed potatoes and allowed for significant exports, mainly to Russia, of&#13;
sugarbeet, maize, and winter wheat seeds. Since independence in 1990, however, seed exports&#13;
have declined drastically. Drought reduced the production of maize seeds in 1993 and left the&#13;
country with a need to import while exports of sugarbeet foundation seeds ceased because of&#13;
trade restrictions imposed by the Government. Currently, Ukraine exports annually 90,000 tons&#13;
of Fl (first generation hybrid of two different parent lines) and open-pollinating seed and&#13;
between 5,000 and 10,000 tons elite seed mainly to the FSU republics. Almost 70,000 tons of&#13;
these are exported under trade agreements between the Government of Ukraine and the&#13;
governments of other FSU states.4&#13;
Development of Varieties&#13;
1.18         Varietal development and maintenance of seed stocks is the responsibility of the&#13;
Ukrainian Academy of Agricultural Sciences (UAAS), which was established as an independent&#13;
3     Foundation seed is the seed population used to produce the seeds planted by the farmer (commercial&#13;
seeds). Foundation seed is also known as parent seed, basic seed, or elite seed.&#13;
4     The Fl and open-pollinating seeds consist of about 40,000 tons of seed for peas and oats, 25,000 tons&#13;
of maize seed, and 3-4,000 tons of seed for sugarbeet and oil crops. The total value of these seed exports is&#13;
approximately $90 million. The value of elite seed exports (com, sugarbeet, and some small grains) was about&#13;
$50 million in 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                   Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
Academy in 1991. It has 51 research institutes and a network of 126 experimental stations&#13;
specializing in testing new plant varieties. The most important research institutes are in Kyiv&#13;
(sugarbeet, maize, and soybeans), Dnipropetrovsk (maize and oilseeds), Odesa (cereals, maize,&#13;
and sunflower), Mironovskij (wheat), Kherson (fodder crops), and Kharkiv (maize and gene&#13;
bank). The UAAS has about 7,000 scientists; about 300 of them have Ph.D. degrees, and more&#13;
than 3,000 have Candidate of Science degrees.&#13;
Foundation Seed Production&#13;
1.19        The production of breeder and foundation seeds is carried out by 228 experimental&#13;
stations associated with the research institutes. These farms' primary responsibility is to produce&#13;
breeder and foundation seeds as directed by the institutes. The farms are allowed to engage in&#13;
other business, including food processing, as long as this does not interfere with their seed&#13;
production responsibility. Most of these farms have drying, conditioning, and storage facilities&#13;
to handle the seed crop.&#13;
Commercial Seed Production&#13;
1.20        The production of commercial seeds involves the multiplication of foundation&#13;
seeds into commercial generations, as well as the cleaning, sizing and chemical treatment of&#13;
seeds. The multiplication of all but sugarbeet seeds is currently carried out by specialized farms&#13;
licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MOAF), and the seed processing of major&#13;
crops is done in seed plants owned by the Bread Products Department of the MOAF. In the&#13;
case of sugarbeet seeds, the multiplication is done by seed farms contracted by UKRSACHAR,&#13;
a state owned conglomerate of the Ukrainian sugar industry, and by three seed plants owned by&#13;
UKRSACHAR. Private seed production continues to be limited to a few joint ventures between&#13;
multinational seed companies and local partners, including public entities.&#13;
Seed Pricing&#13;
1.21        Seed prices used to be established by the MOAF. Prices for the breeder (UAAS),&#13;
the seed producer, conditioners and the ultimate seed users (farmers) were set at a fixed&#13;
percentage of the state procurement price established for the respective commodity for which&#13;
the seed was used. These percentages for the various types of seed (breeder, foundation,&#13;
commercial, etc.) were small in comparison to ratios of seed prices to output prices in Western&#13;
seed markets. In general, this meant low prices to the breeder, moderate to very attractive prices&#13;
to the seed-producing farms, low output prices for seed conditioning companies, and hence low&#13;
commercial prices to the farms as the final seed users. As a result, seed prices did not reflect&#13;
real demand and supply, and seed breeding and production was generally not a financially self-&#13;
sustaining activity, but rather dependent on public funding and considered an activity producing&#13;
a public good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 1                                                                        7&#13;
1.22        Although seed pricing has been officially decontrolled, the fact that state&#13;
contracting still accounts for over 70% of all seed marketing means that prices still reflect the&#13;
old structure of controlled margins. The main reason for this is that the funds allocated for the&#13;
purchases under the state contract system were budgeted on the basis of the old seed price&#13;
structure, which made these budget per-ton-of-seed allocations into de facto maximum prices for&#13;
publicly procured seeds. The removal of price controls throughout the economy and reduction&#13;
of state contracts under the 1994 reform program will aid in reducing the MOAF's informal&#13;
ability to impose price regulations. By limiting state purchases to meet the needs of budgetary&#13;
organizations only, the Government is expected to withdraw from making purchases for all but&#13;
small quantities of commercial seeds. Thus, price formation in the foundation and commercial&#13;
seed markets will have to rely on the interaction of domestic supply and demand and Ukraine's&#13;
deeper integration into foreign seed markets.&#13;
Seed Marketing&#13;
1.23        The current system of marketing foundation and commercial seeds is changing&#13;
from one based on state orders to one of contractual arrangements between farmers and seed&#13;
suppliers, such as public entities (UAAS), state owned enterprises, collectives, and a few private&#13;
seed producers. Although formal price regulation and public control of seed marketing is no&#13;
longer mandated by law, practices still follow, to a considerable extent, the MOAF-administered&#13;
system of the past because of the monopolistic behavior of the largely public agents involved in&#13;
seed marketing and the lack of MOAF confidence in and experience with the workings of an&#13;
uncontrolled market. Foundation seed produced and conditioned by the experimental farms is&#13;
sold to the producers of commercial seeds (both hybrid and open-pollinated), who in turn sell&#13;
these seeds to the seed conditioning plants. It is estimated that in 1993 about 70% of these&#13;
transactions were subject to the state contracts but government involvement varies from crop to&#13;
crop.&#13;
1.24        In 1992/93, excess capacity at the UAAS seed conditioning plant at Trostianets&#13;
arose as a result of losing the foundation seed export market in Russia. The Institute for&#13;
Sugarbeet therefore decided to enter into the production of commercial seed at this facility and&#13;
formed the seed production association SENATECH5, which produces both foundation seed for&#13;
UKRSACHAR, as well as commercial hybrid seeds which are sold in Ukraine and abroad&#13;
(mostly Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan). SENATECH's sales of hybrid seeds reached about&#13;
1000 tons in 1993.&#13;
1.25        For sugarbeet seed, the primary customer for foundation seed (until 1992 the only&#13;
customer) is UKRSACHAR. It purchases the foundation seed, places it with state and collective&#13;
farms for the production of commercial seeds under contract, conditions the commercial seed&#13;
at one of its three seed plants, and sells it to the sugarbeet producers. UKRSACHAR then buys&#13;
SENATECH is an open joint stock company for the production of sugarbeet seed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                   Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
the sugarbeets from these producers and processes them into sugar. While UKRSACHAR pays&#13;
the producer of commercial seed at contract terms it has not always paid SENATECH the agreed&#13;
price for foundation seed.&#13;
1.26        For maize seed, the foundation seed produced by the UAAS institutes is sold to&#13;
state and collective farms for the production of F1 hybrid seeds (commercial seeds). While the&#13;
MOAF projects seed demand and supply for the following year, the institutes are effectively free&#13;
to sell their foundation seed to those organizations and companies who are prepared to enter into&#13;
contracts under the institutes' terms.6&#13;
1.27        The farms producing the Fl hybrid seeds sell their production (also under state&#13;
contracts) to the 105 seed plants belonging to the MOAF Department for Bread Products. The&#13;
seed plants dry and condition the seed and sell it to maize producers. The plants have an average&#13;
annual capacity of between 1,000 and 10,000 tons each. Most of them were constructed in the&#13;
1950's and, with one exception, were never refurbished or modernized. This outdated and badly&#13;
maintained equipment causes significant damage to the seeds during processing in these plants&#13;
compromising germination and seeding rates. Contracts between the seed producing farms and&#13;
the seed plants are entered into at the beginning of the production season. These contract prices&#13;
are heavily influenced by government recommended commodity prices.&#13;
1.28        For sunflower seed, the system is less developed than in the other crops. The&#13;
two institutes in Odesa and Zaporizhzhia have small, outdated seed plants with a capacity of&#13;
about 1,500 tons each. These plants sell the foundation seed to producers of commercial seed&#13;
(both hybrid and open-pollinated varieties), and then purchase the production of the foundation&#13;
seed back from the seed producers, condition it, and sell it to the sunflower producers either&#13;
directly or through the offices of the MOAF in each district. In 1993, these two plants produced&#13;
between 3,000 and 4,000 tons of hybrid seeds equivalent to about 50% of the country's annual&#13;
sunflower seed requirements. The rest of the seed requirements of the country are met mostly&#13;
with open-pollinated varieties, the production of which is organized by the MOAF in the&#13;
different districts of the country according to the seed needs forecasted by the MOAF for these&#13;
districts.&#13;
1.29        Recent developments have started to change the structure of the market. For&#13;
example, in sugarbeet seeds, SENATECH broke the monopoly of UKRSACHAR and increased&#13;
the degree of hybridization. It has also reopened some of the important export markets for&#13;
hybrid seeds, particularly in Russia and Kazakhstan. In maize, a U.S. company entered the&#13;
market in 1991/92 with a seed production plant near Rivne and later also built a seed dryer near&#13;
Cherkasy. Two private seed companies developed out of this venture, both of which are&#13;
competing with the seed plants of the MOAF. The UAAS Institute in Odesa started to produce&#13;
6     Seed Ukraine is a quasi-govermmental association of Ukrainian seed breeders and producers. Among&#13;
other duties, it is responsible for allocating commercial seed production for field crops (except sugarbeet) and for&#13;
issuing export licenses for seeds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 1                                                                            9&#13;
maize seeds using fertile germplasm, which requires detasseling7 instead of using the traditional&#13;
male-sterility method. It was successful in managing the detasseling operations; it obtained&#13;
higher-quality seeds, and secured higher prices than those used for transactions under the state&#13;
contract system. Maize foundation and hybrid seed is also increasingly imported from other&#13;
republics of the FSU at prices comparable to those in other heavily discounted world markets.&#13;
1.30         In 1995, state orders have been discontinued for all products, including seeds.&#13;
Since Government purchases will be confined to those which meet the needs of budgetary&#13;
organizations (and no budgetary organizations are involved in seed reproduction and processing)&#13;
government seed purchases should include only small quantities of commercial seed. The vast&#13;
bulk of seed marketing is expected to take place under contracts between enterprises, with the&#13;
MOAF no longer expected to play an allocational or financial role. Deviations from the pricing&#13;
guidelines of the old MOAF system will become the norm rather then the exception as state-&#13;
owned enterprises are corporatized and become independent of MOAF directives.&#13;
Seed Trade&#13;
1.31         Import and export of seed is largely confined to the FSU and is done mainly via&#13;
intergovernmental agreements between the FSU republics. Seed imports have not been under&#13;
quota but are subject to licensing. Almost all seed exports have been handled under a quota and&#13;
licensing system.8 Under intergovernmental agreements, Fl hybrid exports in 1994 were set at&#13;
700 mt of sunflower seed and 12,500 tons of maize seed. The overall quotas for elite seeds for&#13;
1994 were 4,300 tons for grains and 27 tons for sunflower seed. Quotas for Fl seeds for&#13;
sunflower and maize (as well as other grains) are apparently not differentiated from the overall&#13;
quotas for grain and sunflower seed exports (2.5 million and 100,000 tons, respectively).&#13;
1.32         Export quotas used to be determined by the Cabinet of Ministers by estimating&#13;
seed production and subtracting expected "domestic needs." The MOAF was responsible for&#13;
ensuring the availability of seed to meet the planned export levels under intergovernmental&#13;
agreements. Seed Ukraine (SU), an association of seed breeders and producers, was given&#13;
responsibility for verifying the quality of seed for export and for administering the Ministry's&#13;
quotas on seed exports. Licenses for export were issued by the Ministry of Foreign Economic&#13;
Relations. In addition to the quota and licensing systems, agricultural commodities, including&#13;
seed, were subject to export taxes ranging from 10-30% in 1993. The export taxes for maize&#13;
seed and sunflower seed were 30%. These tariffs were eliminated in 1994. In addition to the&#13;
licensing procedures and export taxes, seed exports have been hampered by surrender&#13;

designated as female parent.&#13;

quantitative restrictions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                    Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
requirements on foreign currency earnings (with conversion at Government-controlled exchange&#13;
rates).&#13;
1.33         As of November 1, 1994, quotas on most exports from Ukraine were abolished:&#13;
seed exports are no longer subject to any quotas or licensing restrictions. The exchange rate has&#13;
been unified at the market rate; the surrender of foreign exchange earnings has been reduced and&#13;
this conversion is done at the inter-bank currency exchange rate. As a result, the anti-export&#13;
bias to which seeds have been subjected, appears to have been largely removed.&#13;
The Regulatory Framework&#13;
1.34         The formal regulatory framework for the seed system has evolved gradually since&#13;
the breakup of the FSU. Its most important elements include: (a) seed certification and&#13;
laboratory testing for seed quality, administered by the State Commission for Seed Quality&#13;
Control of the MOAF; (b) phytosanitary inspection service, administered by the Central State&#13;
Inspection of Plants of the MOAF; (c) registration of new plant varieties and testing for&#13;
distinctness to determine eligibility for plant variety protection, administered by the State&#13;
Commission for Testing and Protection of Plant Varieties of the MOAF; (d) the Plant Variety&#13;
Protection System, administered by the Patent Office; and (e) the registry of seed producers,&#13;
administered by SU. The most pertinent legislation regulating the industry consists of the&#13;
recently adopted Seed Law and the Law on Plant Variety Protection. The Seed Law is not&#13;
considered fully satisfactory by international standards.&#13;
Performance of the Seed System and Issues&#13;
1.35         The long-term performance of the seed system is probably best reflected in the&#13;
prevailing yield levels in crop production and the level of seed exports. While yields are&#13;
obviously influenced by systemic management problems at the farm level and the lack of timely&#13;
available recurrent inputs, it is clear that the yield gap of 25% to 50%, in comparison to&#13;
countries with similar ecological conditions, is at least partially attributable to the relatively low&#13;
quality of the domestic seeds. Over and above the mediocre performance during the Soviet&#13;
period, the system currently shows clear signs of deterioration, with the distinct possibility of&#13;
losing its capacity to supply improved seeds to the domestic producer and export markets. In&#13;
terms of reduced availability of improved seeds and lower agricultural production, the impact&#13;
of such a turn of events could be a decrease in domestic crop production and annual export&#13;
revenues on account of declining yields, resulting from the increasing use of degenerated open-&#13;
pollinated seeds. The loss in gross value of agricultural production associated with these&#13;
reductions are estimated to be equivalent to about $1 billion.9&#13;
9     The use of degenerated open pollinating seed is assumed to reduce yields by 20% or more in 1-2 years.&#13;
(continued...)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 1                                                                              11&#13;
1.36         The seed system has suffered from institutional, financial, and technical problems&#13;
similar to those of the agricultural sector as a whole. They are reflected in an inadequate quality&#13;
and quantity of improved seed available for domestic producers and for export. Factors peculiar&#13;
to the seed system which particularly affected the performance of seed breeding and production&#13;
include: (a) the isolation of breeding from international scientific developments and its protection&#13;
from international competition; (b) heavy dependence on public funding, which limits the&#13;
allocation of resources to levels that, under the current fiscal crisis, severely curtail further seed&#13;
development, the maintenance of the existing germplasm and breeding infrastructure and the&#13;
retention of specialized scientific staff; and (c) the increasingly outdated capital stock used by&#13;
the seed industry.&#13;
1.37         The Government is well aware of the importance of the seed industry for the&#13;
productivity of agriculture and it also recognizes the critical state in which the seed industry&#13;
finds itself. However, the MOAF tends to view technological backwardness as its main problem&#13;
and underestimates the pervasive constraints imposed on the seed system by administratively&#13;
determined access to seed breeding, production and processing, by administratively controlled&#13;
seed pricing, marketing and trade, and by the weak incentives of the prevailing public ownership&#13;
structure.&#13;
1.38         The Government has moved on establishing a legal basis for the seed system's&#13;
regulatory framework by passing in 1993 a law on Plant Variety Protection and a Seed Law&#13;
regulating the principles of seed production, release, and utilization. It is necessary, however&#13;
to harmonize these laws and regulations with related international conventions and to free the&#13;
domestic seed system from excessive public sector control if Ukraine is again to become a major&#13;
supplier of germplasm and seeds to the world markets, as well as a beneficiary of international&#13;
developments in the seed industry. To this end, plant variety protection legislation should be&#13;
harmonized with the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV),&#13;
and the Ukrainian regulations for seed certification and seed testing should be harmonized with&#13;
OECD and the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) conventions. The system of&#13;
variety registration currently in place appears inefficient and overly expensive. Services for&#13;
registration and variety testing should be increasingly based on a self-financing basis by&#13;
introducing a system of user fees. In addition, the Seed Law would need to be adjusted to fully&#13;
reflect the liberalization of breeding, production, pricing, marketing and trade of seed in&#13;
accordance with the Government's economic reform program.&#13;
1.39         In 1993, as a result of the mounting problems in the supply of seeds, the&#13;
Government decided to embark on an investment program to construct ten new seed plants for&#13;
maize and sunflower seeds. The cost for the program was estimated at US $70 million, of which&#13;
about 90% were estimated to be foreign cost for imported equipment and machinery to be&#13;
9(. . continued)&#13;
This would reduce grain production by 8 million tons ($600 mnillion), sugar production by 900,000 tons ($300&#13;
million), and oilseed production by 600 thousand tons ($100 million). Other field crops would also suffer falls&#13;
in production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                 Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
financed by external borrowing. The Government requested financial support from the Bank for&#13;
the establishment of three of the ten plants, while the remaining seven of the program were to&#13;
be financed by bilateral and private foreign investment and operated as public enterprises under&#13;
the MOAF and SU. The proposed project responds to this Government request. Construction&#13;
of the parallel public program was scheduled for 1994, but financing difficulties have delayed&#13;
its implementation.&#13;
E. Bank Assistance Objectives and Strategy&#13;
1.40        The objective of Bank assistance to Ukraine is to support the transition to a market&#13;
economy. Economic and sector work, and project financing are focused on establishing an&#13;
economic and institutional environment conducive to: (a) private sector development; (b)&#13;
transferring public assets to the private sector; (c) realizing the agricultural potential; (d)&#13;
developing the financial sector; and (e) establishing a social safety net.&#13;
1.41        In agriculture, the immediate Bank objectives are to support continued market and&#13;
price liberalization, to establish competitive input-output marketing systems, and to assist in&#13;
providing essential inputs and technologies for the development of an efficient agricultural&#13;
production system. In parallel, but with results expected more in the medium term, as reforms&#13;
take hold, Bank support to agriculture would focus on promoting land tenure reform and the&#13;
establishment of a functioning land market, building sustainable extension and advisory services&#13;
for restructuring, and supporting privatized agricultural production, marketing, and processing&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
F. Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement&#13;
1.42        So far, experience in implementing Bank-supported projects in Ukraine is confined&#13;
to an Institution Building Project and a Rehabilitation Loan. Accordingly, there is only limited&#13;
country specific implementation experience on the Bank side and practically no exposure of the&#13;
Ukrainian institutions to the specific procedures governing the implementation of Bank&#13;
investment operations. These factors have been taken into account and are reflected in the&#13;
modest scope of the proposed project, the introduction of a Project Management Unit (PMU),&#13;
and the provision of technical assistance to the implementing agencies, including the PMU. The&#13;
mutual lack of experience in working with each other may require a supervision intensity&#13;
exceeding standard Bank allocations.&#13;
1.43        The Bank's experience worldwide with seed development projects suggests that:&#13;
(a)   interventions should embrace, to the extent practical, the whole seed system and&#13;
be oriented towards long-term growth as opposed to short-term, ad hoc&#13;
involvement;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 1                                                                          13&#13;
(b)   seed sector policies should be conducive to the development of a self-sustaining&#13;
seed industry and the active participation of the private sector;&#13;
(c)   the linkages between the seed system and agricultural research need to be&#13;
reinforced;&#13;
(d)   free-standing seed projects have performed better than interventions based on a&#13;
component approach; and,&#13;
(e)   investments in institutional development, technical assistance, and training have&#13;
generally been decisive elements for good performing seed projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objective&#13;
2.1         The principal objective of the project is to improve the national seed system's&#13;
capacity to produce high quality seed efficiently. In the short-term, the project aims to arrest&#13;
the decline in the domestic availability and exports of quality seed by supporting the&#13;
establishment of private production of high quality commercial seed using domestic and imported&#13;
germplasm. The project would facilitate the development of a competitive seed system in the&#13;
medium term by demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of private seed production, by&#13;
improving the regulatory framework for the seed system, and by assisting in the establishment&#13;
of a sustainable and efficient system for germplasm maintenance and plant breeding. With the&#13;
liberalization of pricing, marketing, and export (recently agreed with the Bank under the Ukraine&#13;
Rehabilitation Loan), domestic seed prices will rise substantially over the medium term reflecting&#13;
the contribution of quality seed to crop yields, thereby allowing seed production and processing&#13;
to become a financially self-sustaining activity. The seed enterprises will also enhance their&#13;
viability by exporting part of their output, mainly to FSU markets where Ukraine has a&#13;
demonstrated ability to sell quality hybrid seed.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.2         Following the Bank-Government discussions of the findings and recommendations&#13;
of the Food and Agriculture Sector Review, the Minister of Agriculture requested Bank&#13;
assistance for the rehabilitation of hybrid seed production. Such a project was identified as the&#13;
first possible Bank operation in agriculture because of: (a) the Government's priority for&#13;
modernizing seed production and its preparedness to liberalize seed pricing and marketing and&#13;
to open up seed production and marketing to the private sector; and (b) the attractive and robust&#13;
economics of producing and using hybrid seed, which protects the viability of such a project&#13;
even under the difficult economic circumstances in the country. In the absence of a well-&#13;
functioning financial intermediation system, the proposed project is confined to one processing&#13;
plant for each of the three major crops grown on the basis of hybrid seed. The project would&#13;
assist in the creation of new private enterprises to process commercial seed. These new&#13;
enterprises will be the direct competitors of the state enterprises under the MOAF, which have&#13;
monopolized commercial seed production. In addition to developing private seed production,&#13;
the Bank's intervention would also facilitate seed trade by strengthening the variety protection&#13;
and seed testing system and would pave the way for private plant breeding by strengthening plant&#13;
breeders' rights and introducing royalty payments to seed breeders.&#13;
2.3         The private sector approach of the proposed project is recognized by the&#13;
Government to be experimental and is seen as a vehicle to test and demonstrate the effectiveness&#13;
of an alternative model of seed production, marketing, and trade. Bank involvement would be&#13;
critical because the emphasis on privatization and on the requisite improvements in seed pricing,&#13;
marketing, and trade and in the regulatory framework are not sufficiently addressed. Bringing&#13;
about these changes in the institutional, economic, and regulatory framework would be beyond&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 2                                                                       15&#13;
the reach of the private sector, without the formal agreement on these aspects reached with the&#13;
Govermnent within a Bank supported project. Bank participation would also be justified to help&#13;
ensure effective implementation in an environment in which there is no experience with&#13;
externally supported investment projects, and considerable policy and administrative instability.&#13;
These institutional, policy-building, and production objectives of the project are consistent with&#13;
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy.&#13;
C. Summary Description&#13;
2.4          The size and complexity of problems facing the national seed system and the risks&#13;
in effectively implementing a large multi-component project by institutions with largely untested&#13;
implementation capacity necessitate a small project based on selective interventions in the seed&#13;
system. The proposed interventions have been selected in light of their potential effectiveness&#13;
in meeting the stated project's objectives and the feasibility of their implementation in the&#13;
existing country environment.&#13;
2.5   To meet the project's short term objective of improving the supply of quality seed for&#13;
the domestic and export market, the project would provide financial and technical assistance for:&#13;
(a) the development of three private enterprises specializing in the multiplication of domestic and&#13;
imported parent hybrid seed for maize, sunflower, sugarbeet, and their processing and&#13;
marketing; and (b) the germplasm maintenance and development for three leading domestic&#13;
suppliers of hybrid maize, sunflower, and sugarbeet seed. To help meet the project's medium&#13;
term objective of developing a competitive seed system, the project would provide financial and&#13;
technical assistance for: (a) improving the regulatory framework for the seed system; (b) the&#13;
development of an agricultural research strategy and plan; and (c) the Ukrainian Institute for&#13;
Agro-Ecology and Biotechnology. In addition to these specific interventions in the seed system,&#13;
the liberalization of seed pricing, marketing, and trade implemented within the context of the&#13;
Government's economic reform program, would establish the enabling policy environment to&#13;
enhance the efficiency of the national seed system. To facilitate efficient project implementation,&#13;
the project would also support a Project Management Unit (PMU) which is legally a part of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The geographical location of the proposed investments are indicated in the&#13;
attached map.&#13;
D. Detailed Features&#13;
Hybrid Seed Production Component (US $46.60 million)&#13;
2.6          The project would provide fiancing to three newly established private seed&#13;
production enterprises for: (a) the equipment and civil works required to operate the seed&#13;
conditioning facilities; (b) certain auxiliary agricultural equipment and machinery for seed&#13;
multiplication; (c) working capital; and (d) technical assistance and training. Initially, these&#13;
companies would each concentrate their activities on the production of only one type of hybrid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                   Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
foundation and commercial seed, i.e. one each for maize, sugarbeet, and sunflower. After&#13;
gaining managing and marketing experience they would be expected to expand vertically and&#13;
horizontally into the production of other types of seed as well as engage in breeding, as is&#13;
customary for traditional seed companies in Western countries.&#13;
2.7          All three enterprises would invest mainly in seed plant machinery and equipment&#13;
in order to establish seed conditioning operations which are capable of producing the quality of&#13;
seed needed to compete in world markets. Adequate buildings are available for the sugarbeet and&#13;
sunflower companies in which this new machinery and equipment can be installed with small&#13;
additional adjustments. New facilities will be constructed for the maize seed company, however.&#13;
It will also be necessary to purchase field machinery and equipment to enable the maize and&#13;
sugarbeet companies to ensure the efficient multiplication of parent seeds on contract seed&#13;
multiplication farms.&#13;
2.8          During the first two years of operation, all three enterprises will have significant&#13;
local borrowing requirements to cover initial working capital needs. Most of the working capital&#13;
in the first year of the project is needed to cover the value added tax payments to be made in&#13;
local currency on imported equipment. In the second year of the project, the main working&#13;
capital needs are for payments to contract farmers for multiplying foundation seed. Financial&#13;
projections (Annex 2) indicate that these borrowing requirements will cease in the third year of&#13;
operation, as profits accrue and become sufficient to cover working capital needs.&#13;
2.9          To ensure that the new companies are managed efficiently, the qualification of&#13;
their key management staff will have to be satisfactory to the Bank, and they will receive&#13;
training and technical assistance during the first two years of operation. Profiles of the three&#13;
prospective seed production enterprises, and terms of reference for the proposed technical&#13;
assistance and for training are presented in Annexes 2 and 5 respectively.&#13;
2.10         Maize Subcomponent (US $22.65 million). Construction of a seed conditioning&#13;
plant to handle 5,000 tons of Fl hybrid seeds annually. This includes: (a) construction&#13;
management and supervision, and acquisition of the equipment necessary for receiving, sorting,&#13;
drying, shelling, bulk storage, cleaning and sizing, treating, bagging, and storing the seed, as&#13;
well as supply of the most important spare parts (about US $9.00 million); (b) equipment to&#13;
refurbish existing facilities to handle 2,000 tons of foundation seed annually, including eight&#13;
huskers, three gravity tables, three shellers (about US $0.34 million); (c) auxiliary equipment&#13;
for field operations such as seed maize harvesters (US $0.77 million); (d) laboratory equipment,&#13;
including seed counters, germination chambers, cold test chambers, and moisture testers (about&#13;
US $0.04 million); (e) computers, printers, and software (US $0.01 million); (f) civil works for&#13;
preparing the construction site and construction of buildings for administration, laboratory, seed&#13;
sizing and storage, and all foundations (equivalent to about US $1.5 million); and (g) training&#13;
for nine person-months and technical assistance in general management, plant management,&#13;
financial management, and seed quality management (about US $0.30 million). The plant's&#13;
quarterly working capital requirements are estimated to reach a maximum of about US $8.21&#13;
million in the second quarter of the first year of operation. Over the pre-operational year of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 2                                                                       17&#13;
enterprise, the value added tax (VAT) payments on imported equipment generate most of&#13;
working capital needs. In the first two quarters of the first operational year, payments to&#13;
farmers for multiplying foundation seed (which the plant then processes for final sale) boost&#13;
quarterly working capital requirements (in local currency) to an equivalent of about US $8.2&#13;
million. By the end of this first year, accrued profits are sufficient to cover working capital&#13;
requirements.&#13;
2.11        Sunflower Subcomponent (US $9.65 million). Acquisition and installation of&#13;
machinery and equipment into an existing building to condition 3,910 tons of hybrid and 90 tons&#13;
of foundation sunflower seed annually. This includes installation management and supervision,&#13;
and all machinery and equipment for receiving, drying, precleaning, bulk storage, sizing,&#13;
treating, bagging, and storing the seed, as well as supply of the most important spare parts&#13;
(about US $3.80 million); computers, printers, and software (about US $0.01 million); civil&#13;
works for the preparation of the land and renovation of the existing building as well as&#13;
construction of scales (about US $0.67 million); training for nine person-months and technical&#13;
assistance in general management, plant management, financial management, and seed quality&#13;
management (about US $0.30 million). The plant's quarterly working capital requirements are&#13;
estimated to peak at about US $3.93 million in the second quarter of the first year of operation.&#13;
In the first year of the project, working capital requirements are generated largely by VAT&#13;
payments on imported equipment. In year two, payments to farmers for multiplying foundation&#13;
seed to be processed and sold are the main source of working capital needs.&#13;
2.12        Sugarbeet Subcomponent (US $14.29 million). Acquisition and installation of&#13;
machinery and equipment into existing buildings to condition 1,450 tons of hybrid and 56 tons&#13;
of foundation sugarbeet seed annually. This includes installation management and supervision,&#13;
and all machinery and equipment for receiving, drying, precleaning, bulk storage, sizing,&#13;
treating (and pelletizing), bagging, and storing the seed, as well as the most important spare&#13;
parts (about US $4.12 million); auxiliary machinery and equipment to handle the field operations&#13;
of seed production, including seed drills, sprayers, steckling harvesting and planting machines&#13;
and combines, (about US $0.61 million); dryers US $0.3 million; computers, printers, and&#13;
software (US $0.01 million); civil works for refurbishing the existing facilities and the yard&#13;
(about US $0.42 million); training for nine person-months and technical assistance for general&#13;
management, plant management, financial management, and seed quality management (about US&#13;
$0.30 million). The plant's quarterly working capital requirements are estimated to peak at about&#13;
US $7.32 million in the second quarter of the first year of operation. In the first year and a half&#13;
of the project, the plant's largest working capital needs are to pay for foundation seed&#13;
multiplication before processing for final sale, and to pay VAT on equipment imported to&#13;
refurbish the plant.&#13;
Regulatory Framework Component (US $2.34 million)&#13;
2.13        The project would finance equipment, technical assistance, and training for the&#13;
regulatory agencies responsible seed quality control and for the testing and protection of plant&#13;
varieties. These elements of the seed system need upgrading to allow the development of an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

efficient, internationally competitive, and sustainable seed industry. Terms of reference for the&#13;
technical assistance and training are given in Annex 5.&#13;
2.14        Equipment (US $2.21 million). Equipment would be provided for seed&#13;
certification laboratories managed by the State Commission for Seed Quality Control (about US&#13;
$0.24 million), and laboratory and field equipment for the variety testing system under the State&#13;
Commission for Testing and Protection of Plant Varieties (US $1.97 million). Procurement of&#13;
the laboratory and field equipment for the variety testing system would be subject to submission&#13;
of a plan, satisfactory to the Bank, for modernizing the system following the review (by&#13;
September 30, 1995) of the plant variety testing system under the technical assistance program&#13;
proposed in paragraph 2.15. Assurances to this effect have been obtained during negotiations.&#13;
2.15        Technical Assistance (US $0.11 million). Specialized consultant services would&#13;
be provided for reviewing the seed legislation (US $0.02 million) and the plant variety testing&#13;
system (US $0.04 million); and for assisting in improving Distinctiveness, Uniformity and&#13;
Stability (of varieties) (DUS) testing and seed certification (US $0.03 million); for upgrading the&#13;
crop inspection system (US $0.01 million); and for operating electrophoretic equipment (US&#13;
$0.01 million). Following the review of the seed legislation, the MOAF and the UAAS would&#13;
provide the Bank with plans to amend or modify the existing legislation to implement the&#13;
recommendations of the review.  Assurances to this effect have been obtained during&#13;
negotiations: this plan would be submitted to the Ukrainian Parliament by March 31, 1996.&#13;
2.16        Training (US $0.03 million). External training would be provided for three&#13;
Ukrainian technicians in the organization and management of seed certification trials.&#13;
Germplasm Maintenance and Improvement Component (US $2.91 million)&#13;
2.17        The project would provide for critical investments and training for the germplasm&#13;
maintenance and improvements in UAAS research institutes in Kyiv, Odesa, and Zaporizhzhia.&#13;
This would help sustain a flow of quality breeder and foundation seed to the seed-producing&#13;
enterprises under the project. In addition, this component would provide technical assistance for&#13;
a review of the Ukrainian agriculture research system to identify a suitable strategy for&#13;
agricultural technology generation and a program for adjusting the structure and focus of the&#13;
current system to Ukraine's needs and to ensure its efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability.&#13;
2.18        Sugarbeet Institute (US $0.96 million). Acquisition of precision plot machinery&#13;
including about four harvesters, four tractor-mounted, four-row seeders (US $0.62 million);&#13;

2.21         Agro-Ecology and Biotechnology Institute (US $0.40 million). Acquisition of&#13;
laboratory equipment (US $0.20 million); chemicals and reagents (US $0.10 million); and&#13;
technical assistance (US $0.10 million) for advanced methods for genetic definition of plant&#13;
varieties.&#13;
2.22         Agricultural Research Review (US $0.22 million). Provision of about 225 days&#13;
of foreign and 450 days of local consultant services, subsistence expenditure for external&#13;
consultants, and local transport.&#13;
Project Management Component (US $0.34 million)&#13;
2.23         To ensure efficient and timely implementation, the project would provide the&#13;
PMU with office equipment (US $0.01 million); a project manager, an assistant, and one&#13;
bilingual support staff member for a period of three years (US $0.03 million); operations&#13;
expenses for the PMU including external audits of project accounts and statements of&#13;
expenditures (US $0.07 million); and 16-month technical assistance to the PMU (US$0.23&#13;
million).&#13;
Seed Marketing and Trade Policy Measures&#13;
2.24         The Government of Ukraine has embarked on a broad economic reform program&#13;
which includes the liberalization of production, marketing, and trade of all seeds from state&#13;
orders, price controls, and export quotas. The effective implementation of these liberalization&#13;
measures in the seed sector and their maintenance would be monitored. Assurances have been&#13;
obtained during negotiations that the seed marketing and trade liberalization measures specified&#13;
for the seed sector in the Seed Policy Letter by the Minister of Economy (dated September 9,&#13;
1994) would be fully applied and maintained. These measures include elimination (for hybrid&#13;
seeds for maize, sunflower, and sugarbeet) of seed pricing restrictions, restrictions on purchase&#13;
and sale of seed, and quantitative export and import restrictions governing seed trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E. Project Costl'&#13;
2.25         The total cost of the project, is estimated at US $47.8 million, excluding taxes and&#13;
duties of US $15.5 (Table 2.1). About US $30.7 million of the total are foreign costs and US&#13;
$17.1 million are local expenditures." These estimates are based on March 1994 prices&#13;
prevailing in the international market and on local cost and price data gathered in March 1994.&#13;
Local costs were updated to December 1994 cost levels in line with domestic inflation and&#13;
changes in the exchange rate. Domestic sales prices were also revised to reflect December 1994&#13;
levels. Physical contingencies of 18% and price contingencies in accordance with Bank&#13;
guidelines'2 have been added to the base cost. Physical and price contingencies amount to&#13;
approximately 21 % of the project's base cost. Because public sector entities are exempted from&#13;
inport duties, import taxes are included in the project cost only for the imported equipment&#13;
benefitting the private seed production enterprises. Including import duties and value-added&#13;
taxes, the project cost is US $63.3 million.&#13;
F. Flnancing&#13;
2.26         The Bank loan of US $32.0 million would be equivalent to the project's foreign&#13;
exchange (US $30.65 million) and about 4% (US $1.35 million) of its local expenditures. The&#13;
Bank loan would finance 51 % of total project costs including taxes and duties: this is equivalent&#13;
to 67% of project costs net of value-added taxes and import duties. The loan would finance the&#13;
cost of: (a) investment for equipment and machinery and technical assistance and training for&#13;
the seed production companies, the regulatory framework component and the germplasm&#13;
maintenance program; (b) 50% of the civil works cost for the maize seed production plant; and&#13;
(c) the cost of the PMU including related technical assistance. The participating seed enterprises&#13;
would finance the civil works cost (except for one half of the civil works cost of the maize plant,&#13;
which would be funded by the Bank loan), VAT and import taxes on imported equipment, and&#13;
working capital requirements through initial share holders equity and domestic borrowing of the&#13;
equivalent US$31.3 million (49% of total project cost). Bank Ukraina (BOU), a local bank, has&#13;
agreed to provide the short-term funds for covering part of the companies' working capital,&#13;
estimated at about US $19.5 million.&#13;
to     Project costs are calculated in U.S. dollars only because the instability of the karbovanets makes it&#13;
impractical to quote prices in domestic currency.&#13;
"Value-added taxes and import duties equivalent to US $15.5 million are included in total local cost estimates in&#13;

Including value-added taxes and import duties equivalent to US $15.48 million.&#13;
2.27          Grant cofinancing possibilities are being discussed with several donors, which&#13;
have indicated interest in providing for the cost of the PMU and for the technical assistance&#13;
needs and training, equivalent to approximate US $2.0 million. These cofinancing possibilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                  Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
need confirmation.  Agreement has been reached during negotiations that once such grant&#13;
resources become available, the Borrower and the Bank would determine whether to allocate the&#13;
corresponding loan funds to other categories or to cancel the funds.&#13;
G. Flow of Funds&#13;
2.28        Loan proceeds would be channeled through the Ministry of Finance (MOF) which&#13;
would, on behalf of the Borrower, transfer these funds to the implementing entities in the&#13;
following ways:&#13;
(a)   investment funds allocated to the three private seed production companies&#13;
would be administered by UkrExImBank, acting as a financial agent&#13;
between the Ministry of Finance and the seed production enterprises; and&#13;
(b)   investment funds allocated to the regulatory agencies of the MOAF, the&#13;
UAAS breeding institutes and the PMU would be channeled through a&#13;
Special Account (SA) to be established in a commercial bank (para.&#13;
2.39).&#13;
2.29        The   financial  agency&#13;
arrangement was chosen because of the lack          Table 2.2: Financing Plan&#13;
of an  effective  system  for financial                          Amount   % of&#13;
intermediation and because Government line        Sources         USS     Total&#13;
agencies lack experience in acting as a     IBRD                  32.00    SI&#13;
financial  agent.  This  arrangement  is    Seed Enterprises     31.30     49&#13;
justified by the pilot nature of this project&#13;
establishing seed enterprises outside the  TOTAL                  63.30    100&#13;
public sector. The Borrower has confirrned&#13;
the financial agent (UkrExImBank) and a&#13;
financial agency agreement will be signed between the MOF and UkrExlmBank.&#13;
H. Terms and Conditions for Onlending&#13;
2.30        About US$ 23.9 million, or about 75 % of the loan proceeds, would be passed on&#13;
by the borrower to the Project's financial agent which would pass on these funds as subloans to&#13;
the private seed enterprises. Since almost all of these funds would be used for payments for&#13;
imported goods and services and given the prevailing monetary instability in the country, these&#13;
subloans will be made in US dollars, and payment of interest and principal would be made in&#13;
US dollars or in local currency equivalent at the exchange rate used for converting export&#13;
earnings into local currency at the time of repayment. The MOF as the representative of the&#13;
Borrower will pass on the loan proceeds to the financial agent at an interest rate of 4 percentage&#13;
points above the standard Bank's lending rate. UkrExImBank would pass on to the seed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 2                                                                       23&#13;
enterprises at a rate not to exceed 4.30 percentage points above the Bank's base rate to cover&#13;
the financial agent's administrative cost. The credit risk would be borne by the Government.&#13;
The cost of the default risk to the Government would be defrayed by the 4% interest rate spread&#13;
earned by the Government, which in addition to the cost of the intennediation, would&#13;
approximately cover the commercial risk of the sub-borrowers. The financial agent would be&#13;
responsible for: (a) preparation of subloan agreements between the Government, the financial&#13;
agent, and the sub-borrowers specifying the terms and conditions for onlending, including&#13;
suitable collateral arrangements; (b) the maintenance of subloan accounts and subloan&#13;
supervision; and (c) recovery of the subloans on behalf of the Government. The Borrower&#13;
would pay the financial agent a fee of 0.30 percentage points of the sub-borrowers' outstanding&#13;
loan balances accruing interest and one half of one percent of the value of the principle&#13;
collected. Upon full recovery of the subloan, the Borrower would pay the financial agent a&#13;
premium equivalent to one half of one percent of the subloan amount as an incentive to collect.&#13;
Subloans are expected to carry not more than four years of grace and be recovered within not&#13;
more than eleven years. The subsidiary loan agreements between the Borrower and the seed&#13;
enterprises would stipulate inter alia that no dividends would be paid to the shareholder unless&#13;
the sub-borrowers are current in their debt service and unless the company has reached a debt&#13;
equity ratio not exceeding three to one. The distribution of dividends could not exceed 50% of&#13;
the company's net profit until the its debt equity ratio has reached one to one. Loan recoveries&#13;
would be used, in agreement between the Borrower and the Bank, for improvements in the&#13;
national seed system, including lending to private seed production and processing entities other&#13;
than the three which originally benefitted from the project.&#13;
2.31        Agreements on the flow of funds (paras. 2.28) on the terms and conditions for&#13;
onlending Bank loan proceeds and restrictions on dividend payments by the seed enterprises&#13;
(para. 2.30) have been obtained during negotiations.&#13;
I. Procurement&#13;
2.32        Procurement of goods, works, and services under the project will amount to the&#13;
equivalent of US $39.7 million.'3 The equivalent of US $32.0 million will be Bank loan&#13;
financed, and US $7.7 million will be financed by equity contribution of the shareholders of the&#13;
seed production enterprise and local borrowings. Procurement of goods and civil works would&#13;
follow the Bank's guidelines for procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits, and the&#13;
Borrower will use the Bank's standard bidding documents. A margin of preference (up to 15&#13;
percent as defined under the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans) in the evaluation&#13;
of bids under ICB procedures will be offered to goods manufactured in Ukraine. Employment&#13;
of consultants financed by bilateral sources on a grant basis will follow the respective donors&#13;
13    US $23.6 million working capital for the seed production plants is not included in the procurement&#13;
plan, since they are expected to be financed through shon-term local borrowing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                 Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
regulations, with terms of reference and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank. The proposed&#13;
procurement arrangements (Table 2.3) are described below:&#13;
(a)   The design, construction, and the supply and installation of seed processing&#13;
equipment for the three seed plants (US $28.7 million) would be procured&#13;
through ICB in three separate turnkey contracts following the latest draft of the&#13;
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the Supply and Installation of Plant and&#13;
Equipment and using the two stage bidding approach. The invitation for bids&#13;
would be grouped for the three seed plants, but bids and contracts could be made&#13;
individually for each of the plants.&#13;
(b)   The procurement of agricultural equipment for the three seed production&#13;
enterprises (US $3.0 million), machinery for the Regulatory Framework&#13;
Component (US $2.5 million), and the Germplasm Maintenance Program (US&#13;
$2.5 million) would be grouped to the extent possible and would follow&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures using the Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documentsfor Goods.&#13;
(c)   Laboratory equipment, chemicals, and data processing equipment for the&#13;
Regulatory Framework Component and the Germplasm Maintenance Program&#13;
(US $0.8 million) would be procured under International Shopping (IS)&#13;
procedures based on a comparison of price offers from at least three suppliers&#13;
from at least three different countries, with a threshold for individual contracts&#13;
of US $300,000 and an aggregate ceiling of US $1,000,000 (to allow for&#13;
contingencies). Procurement of these items under ICB is impractical because it&#13;
will occur over an extended period, the items benefit five different entities, the&#13;
items' nature is very heterogeneous, and hence requires a multitude of suppliers.&#13;
(d)   Consultant and training services for the seed companies, the regulatory agencies.&#13;
the UAAS Institutes and the agricultural research review (US $1.9 million) are&#13;
expected to be grant financed by bilateral agencies. In such cases, the selection&#13;
would follow donor guidelines. However, the Bank would be given an&#13;
opportunity to comment on short-listed consultants, the provision of services&#13;
would follow the terms of reference provided by the Bank, and the qualification&#13;
of the consultants would be acceptable to the Bank. In the case that sufficient&#13;
bilateral cofinancing of the projects technical assistance were not to become&#13;
available, Bank loan funded consultant services would follow the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for the use of consultants.  Consulting contracts exceeding US&#13;
$100,000 with firms and exceeding US $50,000 for individual contracts would be&#13;
subject to prior review by the Bank. The selection of the manager of the PMU&#13;
and the external auditor(s) of the project accounts and the financial statements of&#13;
the three seed enterprises would also have to be acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

2.33        All invitations for bids, and all bid evaluation and award proposals for turnkey&#13;
procurement, ICB, and IS, which would be about 96% of the Bank financed contracts, would&#13;
be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank.&#13;
2.34        Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that procurement would follow&#13;
the procedures outlined in paras. 2.32 and 2.33. Selective post review of awarded contracts&#13;
below the threshold levels will be carried out. Arrangements for monitoring procurement are&#13;
included in para. 3.9.&#13;
J. Disbursements&#13;
2.35        The Bank loan would be expected to be disbursed over a period of 66 months.&#13;
The loan is expected to become effective in mid-1995. Invitations for bids for the construction&#13;
and supply of the three seed plants under turnkey contracts would be issued following Board&#13;
presentation. The contracts could be awarded by late 1995 and plant and equipment deliveries&#13;
could commence by the second quarter of 1996. Bidding and supply for the other equipment and&#13;
machinery would commence in late 1995 and be completed in mid-1997. Technical assistance&#13;
would continue to be executed through early 2000. Under these assumptions, project completion&#13;
could be expected before March 2000, as estimated in Table 2.4.&#13;
2.36        This schedule suggests a faster completion of loan disbursements than the Bank's&#13;
average sectoral or regional experience. This assumption is justified in light of the fact that about&#13;
75 % of the loan funds would be deployed for the three seed plants, the procurement of which&#13;
would be on the basis of turnkey contracts, for which bids would be invited immediately&#13;
following Board presentation. For most of the remaining items to be financed by the loan,&#13;
procurement would be expected to be completed by June 1997. The bidding documentation has&#13;
been prepared through pre-project technical assistance and is currently being evaluated by the&#13;
seed enterprises and the MOF.&#13;
2.37        The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance:&#13;
(a)   100% of the expenditures for the goods and equipment of the turnkey contracts&#13;
for the sugar beet and the sunflower seed plant;&#13;
(b)   100% of the expenditures for goods and equipment, and 50% of the related civil&#13;
works, of the turnkey contracts for the maize seed plant;&#13;
(c)   100% of the foreign cost, 100% of local ex-factory cost, or 75% of local&#13;
expenditures for other items, of the auxiliary field equipment for the maize and&#13;
sugarbeet seed companies;&#13;
(d)   100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local ex-factory expenditures, and 75%&#13;
of local expenditures of other items, for equipment, machinery, laboratory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

be made against Statements of Expenditures, which would be retained by the PMU for review&#13;
by Bank supervision missions and auditors for at least two years after disbursement.&#13;
2.39        To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special&#13;
Account (SA) in a major foreign commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank to cover the Bank's share of expenditures. The authorized allocation would be US&#13;
$300,000, representing about four months of average expenditures disbursed through the Special&#13;
Account. At the request of the Borrower, and based on the project needs, the Bank would make&#13;
an initial deposit or deposits of US $200,000 into the SA up to the amount of the authorized&#13;
allocation. Applications for the replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted&#13;
monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.&#13;
Documentation requirements for replenishment would foliow the Standard Bank procedures. In&#13;
addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the&#13;
Borrower would accompany all replenishment applications.&#13;
2.40        At negotiations, agreement have been reached that the disbursement arrangements&#13;
would follow the procedures specified in paras. 2.37, 2.38 and 2.39.&#13;

3.1         The main component of the project is the design, supply, and installation of three&#13;
seed processing and treatment plants for hybrid seed. This component would be implemented&#13;
by three private joint stock companies specializing in the production and marketing of hybrid&#13;
maize, sunflower, and sugarbeet seed. These companies are in the process of being established&#13;
and would procure the plants, including the related civil works through turnkey contracts under&#13;
ICB. This would greatly facilitate efficient implementation of this component. The shareholders&#13;
of these new companies are private individuals, privatized collective farms, associations of&#13;
farms, Ukrainian corporate interests, joint ventures, and public entities involved in the seed&#13;
industry. There is considerable interest on the part of foreign firms in joining these enterprises,&#13;
and commitments by two foreign firms to participate have been made prior to Board&#13;
presentation. Agreement has been reached with the Government that public entities would not&#13;
hold more than 49% of the shares in each of the seed companies. Feasibility studies, charters&#13;
and shareholder agreements have been worked out for the three new enterprises. These&#13;
enterprises have been recently legally registered. The signing of Subsidiary Loan agreements by&#13;
two of the three enterprises with the Ministry of Finance is a condition of Effectiveness. Foreign&#13;
companies are expected to become shareholders in these companies. The contributions of these&#13;
prospective foreign partners to the companies' share capital, estimated at the equivalent of about&#13;
US $500,000 each, would be applied to cover part of the companies' working capital needs.&#13;
3.2         The improvements in the regulatory framework for the seed industry supported&#13;
by the project would be the responsibility of the corresponding regulatory agencies of the&#13;
MOAF, the State Commission for Seed Quality Control (SCSQC), and the State Commission&#13;
for Testing and Protection of Plant Varieties (SCTPPV).&#13;
3.3         The germplasm maintenance program, including the proposed review of the&#13;
agricultural research system would be the responsibility of the UAAS, which would be supported&#13;
in that review by suitably qualified consultants whose terms of reference and qualifications are&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.4         A Project Management Unit (PMU) is responsible for: (a) liaising between the&#13;
implementing agencies, the Government, and the Bank; (b) ensuring compliance with World&#13;
Bank requirements for reporting on implementation progress, financial control, audits of project&#13;
and enterprise accounts, and monitoring of project impact; (c) determining eligibility of&#13;
disbursements for project and loan funds; (d) providing assistance to the implementing entities&#13;
in matters of procurement and disbursements; and (e) administering the project's technical&#13;
assistance and training component. The establishment of this unit in the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(Figure 3.1) and the nomination of a Project Manager with qualification and terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank are a condition of Effectiveness.&#13;

3.5         The PMU's project manager will be supported by one assistant, one administrative&#13;
staff, and a suitably qualified technical assistant, for a total of 16 months. Qualification and&#13;
terms of reference for this technical assistant would be satisfactory to the Bank. The project&#13;
manager is responsible to the Project Steering Committee, which has been established with&#13;
representatives of the MOF, the MOAF, the UAAS, BOU, UkrExImBank, and a representative&#13;
from the Board of Directors of each of the three seed enterprises. The Steering Committee is&#13;
chaired by a Deputy Minister of Finance.&#13;
B. Schedule of Implementation&#13;
3.6         The core elements of the project are the establishment of the three private seed&#13;
production plants, including the design of the plants, the manufacturing and supply of plant&#13;
machinery and equipment, the construction or refurbishing of buildings housing the plants, and&#13;
the start-up of their operation. This part of the project, which constitutes some 90% of project&#13;
costs, will be procured on the basis of turnkey contracts using a two-stage approach. The&#13;
remaining components of the project are confmed to procurement of machinery and equipment&#13;
and technical assistance for the regulatory agencies of the seed system, UAAS institutions&#13;
responsible for germplasm maintenance, and the PMU. All bidding documents have been&#13;
prepared and invitations to bid for the seed plants and the UAAS breeding institutes will be&#13;
issued following loan approval by the Board.&#13;
3.7         Completion of the project is estimated to take about 60 months, and loan closing&#13;
could be contemplated within 66 months after Board approval of the proposed loan, or by&#13;
September 30, 2000 (Table 3. 1, Implementation Schedule). This relatively short implementation&#13;
period is justified because: (a) the project essentially consists of the procurement of goods on&#13;
a turnkey basis, shielding implementation from the borrower's limited experience in&#13;
implementing Bank-supported projects; and (b) bidding documents for most project sub-&#13;
components have already been prepared and tenders will be invited shortly after Board&#13;
presentation (see paras. 2.35 and 2.36) A Project Implementation Plan indicating responsibilities&#13;
and timing of key implementation steps is given in Annex 6.&#13;

C. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.8         The seed enterprises would prepare annual enterprise accounts, and the benefitting&#13;
regulatory agencies, as well as the UAAS, would prepare annual sub-project accounts, while the&#13;
PMU would prepare project accounts for each fiscal year. These accounts would be audited by&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank. These audit reports would be submitted to the Bank within four&#13;
months after the close of the fiscal year.&#13;
D. Reporting and Evaluation&#13;
3.9         The implementing entities would each prepare quarterly reports covering progress&#13;
in physical implementation and operating results. These reports would be consolidated by the&#13;
PMU into semi-annual progress reports to be submitted to the Government, Bank, and the&#13;
cofinanciers within two months of the close of the semi-annual reporting period. These semi-&#13;
annual progress reports would, in addition to summarizing implementation and operating results,&#13;
include an implementation plan for the six months following the reporting period.&#13;
3.10        A review of the project performance would be carried out by the Borrower, Bank,&#13;
and the cofinanciers 12 months after project effectiveness to determine the status of&#13;
implementation, initial operating results, and the possible need for adjustments in the design of&#13;
the project in light of its performance. In preparation for this review, the GOU would prepare&#13;
and submit to the Bank within 12 months after Board presentation a report summarizing the&#13;
status of the project, problems encountered and recommended corrective measures. If so&#13;
indicated this report would also include a proposed update for the Project Implementation&#13;
schedule.&#13;
3.11        After completion of the project, the PMU would prepare, in collaboration with&#13;
the implementing entities, an implementation completion report (ICR) of a scope satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, which would be submitted to the Bank and the cofinanciers within six months of Loan&#13;
closing.&#13;
3.12        Assurances to meet the financial and progress reporting requirements and to carry&#13;
out the project performance review and the ICR report were obtained during negotiations.&#13;
E. Bank Supervision&#13;
3.13        Notwithstanding the fairly limited project scope, the dominant role of private&#13;
enterprises in project implementation, and the provision of technical assistance for the PMU, this&#13;
is the first investment project in Ukraine and will require close Bank supervision because of the&#13;
lack of experience in implementing Bank-supported projects by both the Borrower and the&#13;
implementing agencies. It is therefore recommended that Bank supervision include, in addition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                   Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
to two annual supervisory visits to review the status of implementation, constant monitoring and&#13;
selective support from the Bank's Resident Mission. It is expected that the project will require&#13;
about 25 staff weeks of Bank supervision input for the first year of implementation, declining&#13;
to 20 staff weeks in subsequent years. It is recommended that:&#13;
(a)   a special project start-up mission be carried out that is staffed to adequately&#13;
address the issues of establishing the required project accounting and reporting&#13;
system, opening a Special Account, recruiting technical assistance, and&#13;
establishing operational procedures for the PMU, procurement, and the&#13;
preparation of withdrawal application for Bank loan proceeds; and&#13;
(b)   a special implementation review be carried out 12 months following loan&#13;
effectiveness to determine eventual adjustmnents needed in the design of the project&#13;
(para. 3.10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Benerits&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
4.1         The project benefits would be, first and foremost, the contribution to safeguarding&#13;
the supply of improved seeds for both the domestic and export markets and the resulting&#13;
favorable impact on productivity, production, and foreign exchange earnings. As indicated in&#13;
Table 4. 1, production of hybrid foundation and commercial seed at full development is estimated&#13;
to reach about 2,100 tons and 10,400 tons under the project. Of this, approximately 60% is&#13;
expected to be utilized domestically and 40 % is expected to be exported at full development. The&#13;
incremental commercial seed produced by the project would be equivalent to 10%, 35%, and&#13;
2% of the current domestic demand for sugarbeet hybrids, sunflower hybrids, and maize&#13;
hybrids, respectively. The expected foreign exchange earnings from exports of project foundation&#13;
and commercial hybrid seeds are estimated at the equivalent of about US $17.8 million per year&#13;
at full development without considering the forced surrender of 50% of the export receipts at&#13;
the low official exchange rate. If this implicit export tax is taken into account, the annual export&#13;
earnings would decline to US $16 million.&#13;
4.2          Second, the project is expected to demonstrate the viability of financially&#13;
sustainable seed production systems. In so doing, it would pave the way for increased private&#13;
sector participation in seed production and a corresponding freeing of Government resources,&#13;
as well as increased foreign investment in the establishment of a modern seed production system.&#13;
4.3         The project is also expected to enhance the international competitiveness of&#13;
UTkrainian seeds through: (a) improved access to high-quality foreign germplasm and foundation&#13;
seed by Ukrainian breeders and seed producers; (b) improvements in seed legislation, including&#13;
plant breeders' rights; and (c) improved plant variety registration and seed testing.&#13;
4.4         The financial benefits of the three seed plants are satisfactory and sufficiently&#13;
robust to provide an adequate safeguard for their viability in case of implementation delays,&#13;
reduced output levels, and unfavorable cost and price developments (Annex 4: Financial and&#13;
Economic Analysis). For the base scenario, which includes the surrender of 50% foreign&#13;
exchange earnings and a value added tax of 20%, the after tax financial rates of return (FRR)&#13;
are 29% for the sugarbeet seed enterprise, and 25 % for both the maize seed and the sunflower&#13;
seed operations. Sensitivity calculations indicate that the sugarbeet seed enterprises would&#13;
remain viable"4 if costs increased by 15%, or if sales fell by 11 %. If sales in the first year of&#13;
operation were delayed by one year, the FRR would still reach 23 %. The corresponding values&#13;
for both the maize and sunflower enterprises are cost increases of 14%-21 %, sales reduction of&#13;
8%-12%, and FFRs of 20% for sales delayed by one year.&#13;
14/   FRR of 15%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                               Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
B. Economic Justification&#13;
4.5         The availability of high-quality seeds is an important element in the revitalization&#13;
of agriculture in Ukraine. It would potentially contribute to a substantial increase in crop&#13;
productivity and enhance the sector's role as an exporter (Table 4.1). Ukraine has good&#13;
ecological conditions, suitably qualified human resources, and experience in seed production.&#13;
The project would support the development of this potential by assisting in establishing a&#13;
sustainable, efficient, and effective seed production system, which is expected to demonstrate&#13;
to policymakers and the incipient private sector the technical, financial, and economic viability&#13;
of alternative seed production system as opposed to the current public system. The project would&#13;
also bring about improvements in the regulatory framework of the seed industry, which would&#13;
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the public controls over the seed industry, as well&#13;
as rationalize its scope.&#13;

4.6   The economic analysis of the project compares all project investments with the&#13;
measurable benefits generated by the hybrid seeds produced in the project seed enterprises. No&#13;
attempts have been made to quantify the benefits resulting from the project's investments in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 4                                                                         37&#13;
regulatory framework of the seed system or in germplasm maintenance, which together constitute&#13;
about 13% of all project investments. Accordingly, no benefits from these investments are&#13;
considered in the analysis. The benefits are measured in terms of reduced seeding rates and&#13;
increased yields resulting from the utilization of the hybrid seed produced under the project.&#13;
Based on this concept, and applying the assumptions spelled out in Annex 4: Financial and&#13;
Economic Analysis, the project yields an economic rate of return (ERR) of about 19%. Testing&#13;
the economic returns against the key variables which determine the benefits, (i.e., reduction in&#13;
seeding rates and increases in yields), suggests that the project would remain viable with a 10%&#13;
lower seeding rate reduction or 10% lower yields than assumed in the base case. Considering&#13;
that this analysis does not count the benefits from investments in the regulatory framework,&#13;
germplasm maintenance, the foundation seed production by the three seed plants, or the impetus&#13;
the project's demonstration effect will provide to the private seed sector, the ERR and its&#13;
robustness are considered satisfactory.&#13;
C. Risks&#13;
4.7          The technical aspect of producing seeds is not a major risk. The technology&#13;
involved is straightforward and well known in Ukraine, and there are sufficient qualified&#13;
technicians available. The modern seed production and processing equipment to be procured&#13;
under the project, along with the private business involvement of the seed enterprises, will&#13;
provide for the technical efficiency and for the attention to details required for high-quality seed&#13;
production. The country is less well equipped to effectively handle the managerial, financial,&#13;
and marketing functions of commercially-oriented seed enterprises, but these problems are&#13;
expected to be reduced by the private nature of the enterprises, the eventual participation of&#13;
foreign firms, and by the provision of technical assistance and training.  $uccess in&#13;
demonstrating the viability and replicability of the system of private seed producers depends to&#13;
a considerable degree on reaching a reasonable degree of macroeconomic stability and on the&#13;
Government's continued support for the liberalization of pricing, marketing, and trade of&#13;
agricultural inputs in general and seed in particular. While such a supportive macro and sector&#13;
policy framework will only develop over time, the financial attractiveness of hybrid seed&#13;
production will demonstrate the feasibility and viability of private seed production in the medium&#13;
term, even in an imperfect macro and sector policy enviromnent. The favorable and robust&#13;
economics of seed production as indicated by the ERR would further justify taking this implicit&#13;
risk.&#13;
4.8          Other risks for the project are the timely availability of key production inputs, and&#13;
the uncertainties about the level of the domestic demand for improved seeds. The latter would&#13;
greatly depend on the profitability of crop production, which is dependent on successfully&#13;
resolving pricing and trade problems in agriculture. Under a scenario of relative depressed&#13;
output prices, the domestic demand for improved seeds may decline in the short run. However,&#13;
the risk of reduced demand would appear manageable considering that: (a) the project would&#13;
concentrate on the production of hybrids, which farms need to replace annually; and (b) the sale&#13;
of produced seeds might be re-oriented to the export market, if local demand falls temporarily.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

38                                                  Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
4.9         A final risk factor affecting project implementation is the borrower's unfamiliarity&#13;
with procedures and regulations associated with the implementation of Bank-supported projects.&#13;
This risk has been taken into account by projecting an implementation period longer than&#13;
technically necessary for turnkey projects of this size and by providing for a PMU and the&#13;
needed technical assistance to support its functions.&#13;
D. Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.10        The proposed project would not create any substantive environmental hazards. The&#13;
potential occupational hazards in the operation of the seed plants through the generation of dust&#13;
and through the handling of hazardous chemicals would be mitigated by including appropriate&#13;
dust removal systems and storage facilities for chemicals in the design of the seed plants.&#13;
4.11         The project has been classified as a category B project. No separate environmental&#13;
analysis is deemed necessary, but the design criteria and operational procedures for the plant&#13;
covering the potential occupational hazards have been included in the specifications for the plants&#13;
in the bidding documentation. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that evaluation&#13;
of bids and awards for the supply and creation of the seed plants will take these criteria into&#13;
account. Moreover, the plants under the project are subject to existing regulations which permit&#13;
environmental supervision by the Ministry for Environmental Protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
SEED MARKET PROSPECTS&#13;
A. Sunflower&#13;
1.1         Sunflower is grown annually in Ukraine on about 1.6 million ha at average&#13;
planting rates of about 5 kg of seed per ha. This requires about 8,000 t of seeds. Hybrid seeds&#13;
were introduced only a few years ago because of the strong emphasis and promotion which the&#13;
Pustovoit Institute in Krasnodar (Russia) put behind its efforts at marketing seeds of open-&#13;
pollinated varieties. Ukrainian authorities suggest that at its peak in 1990, hybrid sunflower seed&#13;
may have occupied as much as 40% of the Ukrainian area planted to sunflower; this would have&#13;
required about 3,200 t hybrid seeds. However, in the poor economic conditions of the last two&#13;
years, the farms switched back to using seeds of open-pollinated varieties because they could&#13;
save their own crop for seeds and because the loss in heterosis (loss in yield) from use of&#13;
replanted seeds was not as great as with corn. Consequently, hybrid seed usage is presently&#13;
limited to probably no more than 30% of the total or about 2,400 t.&#13;
1.2         Seed production is spread throughout the country. There are two larger facilities,&#13;
one at Odesa and one at Zaporizhzhia, each with a capacity for cleaning about 1,500 t of seeds&#13;
per year; both facilities are old and obsolete. A significant portion of this 3,000 t capacity is&#13;
used for the hybrid seed, which the country requires annually. This leaves a balance of about&#13;
5,000 t of seeds, which are being produced throughout the country in the various regions where&#13;
the commercial sunflowers are grown. These seeds are cleaned on small machines, each of&#13;
which handles between 30 and 50 t per year. These small cleaning machines are probably&#13;
adequate as long as they are used to clean farm-saved seed of the open-pollinated varieties.&#13;
1.3         Considering that there are an average of 15,000 seeds in a kg of sunflower seeds,&#13;
a planting rate of 5 kg/ha puts about 75,000 seeds per ha into the ground. Ukraine has relatively&#13;
little and irregular rainfall with only 350 to 450 mm of rain per year. This makes it desirable&#13;
to have no more than 35,000 plants per ha in the field at harvest time to optimize the&#13;
development of the head of the plant and consequently optimize the yield. If high-quality seeds&#13;
are used, one should not expect to lose more than 30-35% of the plants, even though the soil&#13;
conditions at planting time are relatively cool and wet. Thus, a planting rate of about 50,000&#13;
to 55,000 seeds would be sufficient to end up with about 35,000 plants at harvest time.&#13;
Consequently, the requirements for good sunflower seeds in the long term are estimated to be&#13;
about 3.5 kg/ha or about 6,000 t of sunflower seed to plant the 1.6 million ha of sunflower in&#13;
Ukraine.&#13;
1.4         Under the above assumptions, and provided the economic situation of the farming&#13;
sector improves, it would be reasonable to assume that 40-50% of the total of 6,000 t of&#13;
Ukrainian sunflower seed requirements would be hybrid. A larger percentage of hybrid seeds&#13;
should only be assumed if a thorough analysis of the sunflower production regions in Ukraine&#13;
were to reveal that all production of sunflower is on land that is well suited to produce this crop.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                                  Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
Production on marginal land and under marginal environmental conditions will continue to favor&#13;
the use of open-pollinated varieties.&#13;
1.5         In addition to the domestic sunflower seed market, there is also a potential export&#13;
market for Ukrainian-produced sunflower seeds, mostly to Russia. However, because of the&#13;
limited production capacity in the country, Ukraine sold only about 600 t to this market in the&#13;
past.&#13;
B. Sugarbeet&#13;
1.6         Sugarbeet is grown in Ukraine on about 1.6 million ha. At average planting rates&#13;
of about 3.5 units per hectare (1 unit equals 100,000 seeds), about 5.6 million units are used to&#13;
sow all sugarbeet areas in Ukraine.&#13;
1.7         About 20% of the sugarbeet area is currently sown with hybrid seed. Introduction&#13;
of new, improved hybrid seed has been rather slow because of the involvement of the sugar&#13;
industry in seed production. Because the production of seed from open-pollinated varieties is&#13;
much cheaper than the production of hybrid seed and because UKRSACHAR, the State&#13;
Sugarbeet Conglomerate, owns the three seed plants in Ukraine, for years the use of open-&#13;
pollinated varieties was promoted. All three seed plants are old and outdated and need&#13;
remodelling or replacement in order to produce better seed. Also, it is believed that in a more&#13;
competitive market environment, the area planted to hybrids could over a period of 3 to 5 years&#13;
increase to about 50% of the total area planted to sugarbeets. The success of several Western&#13;
European companies selling their high-priced, high-quality seed in Ukraine substantiates this&#13;
thinking.&#13;
1.8         Planting rates are different for hybrid seed and seed of open-pollinated varieties.&#13;
Because of the poor quality of locally-produced seed from open-pollinated varieties, farms use&#13;
about 4 units per ha of this seed; but they use only about 2 units per ha of hybrid seed. In both&#13;
cases, however, losses are high when Ukrainian-produced seed is used; most of this seed does&#13;
not emerge, and final stands are around 150,000 plants per ha for hybrid seed and around&#13;
220,000 plants per ha for open-pollinated varieties. It has been documented recently, however,&#13;
that with seed of world standard quality, planting rates can be reduced to about 150,000 to&#13;
175,000 seeds per ha for final stands of about 135,000 plants per ha. Based on this experience&#13;
and based on the expectation that hybrid seed will quickly occupy a larger area, it is estimated&#13;
that long-term seed needs will amount to about 2.5 million units of which 50% will be hybrid&#13;
(1,700 t).&#13;
1.9         Ukraine has traditionally been an exporter of sugarbeet seed to Russia and other&#13;
former CMEA (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) countries. Russia alone has an annual&#13;
seed requirement equal to that of Ukraine. Most of these exports were foundation seed sales of&#13;
varieties which had been bred by the Institute for Sugarbeet in Kiev, which is why the&#13;
foundation seed plant of Trostianets is close to the border with Russia. However, Ukraine has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1                                                                        43&#13;
recently demonstrated that they can also sell their seeds of the new improved hybrids at premium&#13;
prices if seed qualities are good. It should, therefore, be possible for Ukraine to sell high-&#13;
quality commercial seed into these markets in direct competition with Western European&#13;
companies and at prices that are significantly higher than what can presently be charged for seed&#13;
in Ukraine.&#13;
C. Maize&#13;
1.10        Ukraine produces maize on about 7 million ha; about 4.5 million ha are grown&#13;
for the production of silage and about 2.5 million ha for the production of grain. At average&#13;
planting rates of 25 kg/ha for grain and 30 kg/ha for silage, this requires a total of about&#13;
197,500 t of seed annually. Additionally, in the past the country exported up to 100,000 t to&#13;
countries of the FSU; total seed production in Ukraine was therefore up to 300,000 t, which&#13;
required about 8,000 t of foundation seed.&#13;
1.11        Production of foundation seed was organized by the various research institutes on&#13;
their experimental farms. Since average volumes were relatively small, few facilities were&#13;
required. The philosophy in the FSU towards the production of corn seed, however, was that&#13;
all seed production was based on sterile cytoplasm, and neither in the production of the&#13;
foundation seed nor later, in the production of the commercial seed, were any provisions made&#13;
for detasseling when the sterility broke. This resulted in seeds of generally poor genetic quality.&#13;
Only recently were attempts made to prove that production of seed based on fertile germplasm&#13;
can be successfully managed in Ukraine; it was also proved that farmers are prepared to pay&#13;
premium prices for superior seed.&#13;
1.12        Production of the commercial seed was organized by the MOAF on state and&#13;
collective farms. This seed was then taken to be cleaned by the seed plants. There are 105 of&#13;
these plants in Ukraine belonging to the Bread Products Department (BPD) of the MOAF&#13;
(former State Committee for Bread Products) with capacities ranging from 1,000 t to 10,000 t&#13;
annually; they were constructed in the 1950's, and no remodelling or upgrading has taken place&#13;
since. Consequently, these plants are outdated and cause a substantial damage to the seed.&#13;
Because of the deteriorating conditions of these plants and because of unfavorable weather&#13;
conditions, the production volume of corn seed has declined drastically over recent years, and&#13;
Ukraine had to import seed in 1993 and again in 1994.&#13;
1.13        The previous Government took steps to remedy these production shortfalls by&#13;
arranging for the construction of seven new seed plants with a combined annual capacity of&#13;
70,000 t. However, financing problems have prevented the implementation of this program.&#13;
1.14        The long-term outlook suggests that the corn seed market for Ukrainian-produced&#13;
seed will be smaller than in the past and that a significantly improved genetic and mechanical&#13;
quality will be required to successfully compete in the open market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44                                                 Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
1.15        If the area planted in corn in Ukraine does not change and if improved seed were&#13;
used in the future, total estimated seed requirements would be reduced to about 170,000 t (at&#13;
a planting rate of 25 kg/ha). However, if one anticipates a reduction of the land area planted&#13;
to corn due to elimination of silage production on land which is not well suited to corn (while&#13;
on the other hand anticipating an increase in the production of corn grain), a reduction of the&#13;
seed requirements down to 130,000 t could be anticipated.&#13;
1.16        Also, the export markets will most likely shrink in volume due to the expected&#13;
reduction of corn area in Russia. It is therefore suggested that the total market for corn seed&#13;
produced in Ukraine should be projected in the long term to be about 200,000 t annually.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2A&#13;
PROFLES ON SEED ENTERPRISES&#13;
A. Maize Seed Production Company&#13;
2.1         This company will be formed as a private company with limited liability under&#13;
the laws of Ukraine, and it will be located in Odesa. The company's highest authority will be&#13;
the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. They will approve the annual report, changes to the&#13;
statutes and to the capital structure of the company and will elect the Board of Directors, the&#13;
Chairman, and the auditors. The Board of Directors will meet quarterly and supervise the&#13;
activities of management. All operating plans, investment plans, budgets, and real estate&#13;
transactions, as well as the appointment and dismissal of the General Director, have to be&#13;
approved by the Board.&#13;
Company Activities&#13;
2.2         The company plans to produce annually 2,000 tons of foundation seed and 5,000&#13;
tons of hybrid seed of maize and sell them in domestic and export markets. To this end, the&#13;
company will enter into licensing agreements with breeders for the right to produce and market&#13;
the hybrid seeds developed by these breeders.&#13;
2.3         The company will enter into production contracts for 2,000 tons of foundation&#13;
seed with the experimental farms associated with the Institute for Plant Breeding and Genetics&#13;
in Odesa. These farms will produce the seed in the field and will provide labor for the&#13;
conditioning the seed. Each of these farms presently owns a seed conditioning facility; the farms&#13;
will contribute these facilities as equity in the share capital of the company (with appropriate&#13;
authorization by the UAAS) and thus become shareholders. These facilities are intended to be&#13;
refurbished using funds from the Bank loan to enable the company to offer the highest possible&#13;
quality of foundation seed to its customers and licensees.&#13;
2.4         The company will build a new conditioning facility for 5,000 tons of Fl hybrid&#13;
seed in the southern part of Odesa Region. The land designated as construction site is currently&#13;
owned by a farm and would be contributed by this farm as equity in the share capital of the&#13;
company with appropriate authorization by the UAAS.&#13;
2.5         All seed produced by the company will be based on normal cytoplasm, which&#13;
means the maize will require detasseling. This is a significant change from past practice, since&#13;
presently more than 95% of the maize seeds produced in Ukraine are produced with sterile&#13;
cytoplasm and without any provisions for detasseling. Production with normal cytoplasm was&#13;
introduced by the Institute in Odesa a few years ago, and they proved that it can be managed&#13;
under the conditions of Ukraine. They also demonstrated that this method produces seeds of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46                                                          Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
much higher level of genetic purity than seeds produced with sterile cytoplasm and that these&#13;
seeds can be sold for premium prices.&#13;
2.6           The company will market its seed through distributors and dealers, as well as&#13;
through licensees. Approximately 50% of the company's hybrid seeds will be sold in Ukraine,&#13;
representing a market share of about 1.5%. The company will sell about 60% of its foundation&#13;
seeds in Ukraine to other organizations with the capability to produce hybrid seeds.'5 The&#13;
hybrid seeds produced from this foundation seed will represent a market share of about 25 % in&#13;
Ukraine.&#13;
Financial Projections&#13;
2.7           The financial projections of the company's operations, attached to this Annex,&#13;
indicate that it will be profitable in the first year of seed sales. Net profit after tax in years 5-10&#13;
is estimated at about US $4 million per year. However, prior to its first selling season, the&#13;
company will have to finance the initial investment in plant equipment, civil works, and auxiliary&#13;
agricultural equipment and in seed production, which will require significant borrowings in local&#13;
currency. These borrowings are projected to peak at an equivalent of about US $8 million in&#13;
the second quarter of the project's first year of operation and cease by the end of this first year&#13;
of operation (see attached projected cash flow).&#13;
2.8           The debt-to-equity ratio for the maize enterprise starts at a level of just under 5:1&#13;
in the first year of operation and declines to less than 3.5:1 by Year 2. The initially high ratio&#13;
reflects the large investment needed to build and equip an entirely new plant (US $10 million)&#13;
and the initial capitalization of slightly over US $1.5 million. This level of capitalization is&#13;
equivalent to the initial contributions of the domestic partners of about US $1.5 million. At least&#13;
half of these contributions would be paid in cash. After the expected restructuring with the&#13;
foreign partner by the end of the first year of operation, the total level of capitalization would&#13;
be brought up to at least US $1.75 million. Since the maize enterprise's annual net profits&#13;
exceed US $2.0 million in the first three years, the debt-to-equity ratio declines to 2.2:1 by the&#13;
end of Year 3.&#13;
15     The enterprise to be established under the project will not have sufficient productive capacity to&#13;
reproduce F1 hybrid seeds from all the foundation seeds it produces. Such capacity would require substantial&#13;
further investment, which may possibly be financed at a later date from private sources and/or reinvested&#13;
profits. The enterprise will therefore sell its excess foundation seeds to such producers of hybrid seeds that are&#13;
prepared to comply with the company's standards of quality and that will effectively become licensees of the&#13;
company. Thus the company will be able to establish a brand identity for hybrid seeds produced from its&#13;
foundation seeds.&#13;

Current Status and Schedule for Registration&#13;
2.9         The final corporate structure is still being negotiated. It is understood that the&#13;
company will be private and that shares held by public institutions will not exceed 49%. The&#13;
following shareholders are envisaged:&#13;
(a)   The Institute for Plant Breeding and Genetics, together with four of its associated&#13;
experimental farms. Together they hold less than 25% of the stock.&#13;
(b)   Eleven farms, Fl hybrid seed producers. They will be kolkhozes converted into&#13;
cooperatives or joint stock companies.&#13;
(c)   UkrAgroBusiness (UAB) and RAIS private joint-stock companies under the laws&#13;
of Ukraine.&#13;
(d)   A company of private individuals.&#13;
(e)   Foreign company(ies) have not yet been identified.&#13;
2.10        To accelerate the formation of the company, the Ukrainian partners may form a&#13;
nucleus" company first but will have a stipulation in the shareholder agreement which allows&#13;
for the restructuring with foreign participation within one year from the date of registration.&#13;
Under this scenario, the nucleus company was registered in March 1995.&#13;

ANNEX 2B&#13;
PROFILES ON SEED ENTERPRISES&#13;
B. Sunflower Seed Production Company&#13;
2.1         The company will be formed as a private company with limited liability under the&#13;
laws of Ukraine, and it will be located in Zaporizhzhia. The company's highest authority will&#13;
be the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. They will approve the annual report, any changes to&#13;
the statutes and to the capital structure of the company, and will elect the Board of Directors,&#13;
the Chairman, and the auditors. The Board of Directors will meet quarterly and supervise the&#13;
activities of management. All operating plans, investment plans, budgets, and real estate&#13;
transactions, as well as the appointment and dismissal of the General Director, have to be&#13;
approved by the Board.&#13;
Company Activities&#13;
2.2         The company plans to produce annually 90 tons of foundation seed and 3,910 tons&#13;
of hybrid sunflower seed and to sell it in Ukraine and export markets. To this end, the company&#13;
will enter into licensing agreements with breeders for the right to produce and market seeds of&#13;
hybrids developed by these breeders. Additionally, the company will custom clean seeds of&#13;
other crops (such as wheat and barley) to utilize its conditioning facilities better.&#13;
2.3         The company will build a seed conditioning facility in an existing building close&#13;
to Zaporizhzhia. This building is situated on about 2 ha of land. It was constructed in 1991 and&#13;
is a solid steel structure. Ownership of the property is presently being transferred to the Institute&#13;
for Oilbearing Crops in Zaporizhzhia, and the company will enter into a long-term lease for the&#13;
property with an option to buy. The property is located in an industrial area, and has good&#13;
excess to a major highway and to rail.&#13;
2.4         The company will enter into production contracts for 90 tons of foundation seed&#13;
with the experimental farms of the Institute in Zaporizhzhia. These farms will manage the&#13;
production in the field and deliver the seed to the company for conditioning. The company will&#13;
also contract for the field production of the hybrid sunflower seed with farms in the&#13;
Zaporizhzhia area and further south where farms have the capability for irrigation. All&#13;
sunflower seed will be conditioned at the company's facility.&#13;
2.5         Hybrid sunflower seed is produced using a system of male sterility which ensures&#13;
the desired cross-pollination. However, sunflower seeds are fragile and can easily be damaged&#13;
during handling; hence, a modern seed conditioning facility is of utmost importance to ensure&#13;
minimal damage to the seed in the cleaning and bagging process. The ability to avoid&#13;
mechanical damage will enable the company to sell seeds of better quality (higher germination&#13;
and vigor) and thus develop a preference in the marketplace for its seed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54                                                   Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
2.6          The company will sell its seed through distributors and dealers, as well as through&#13;
licensees. Approximately 75% of the company's hybrid seeds will be sold in Ukraine,&#13;
representing a market share of about 35%. About half the foundation seed produced by the&#13;
company will be sold to other hybrid seed producers. The market share of the hybrid seeds&#13;
produced from this foundation seed could amount to about 18 percent market share in Ukraine.&#13;
Financial Projections&#13;
2.7          The financial projections for the sunflower seed enterprise, attached to this Annex,&#13;
indicate that the company will be profitable in the first year of seed sales. Net profit after tax&#13;
in years 5-10 is estimated at about US $2.0 million per year. However, prior to its first selling&#13;
season, the company will have to finance the initial investment in plant which will require&#13;
significant borrowings in local currency. These borrowings are projected to peak at an&#13;
equivalent of about US $3.9 million in the second quarter of the project's first year of operation&#13;
and to cease in the third quarter of Year 2 (see attached projected cash flow).&#13;
2.8          The debt-to-equity ratio for the sunflower enterprise starts at a level of just over&#13;
1.5:1 in the first year of operation and declines to just over 1:1 by Year 4.  The initial&#13;
capitalization of US $1.5 million, reflects the initial contributions of the domestic partners of the&#13;
equivalent of about US $1.25 million. At least half of these contributions would be paid in cash.&#13;
After restructuring with the foreign partner by the end of the first year of operation, the total&#13;
level of capitalization would be brought up to a least US $1.5 million. Net equity is reduced&#13;
marginally in Years 2-3 and the enterprise's debt to equity ratio rises to about 2:1. Since the&#13;
enterprise's annual net profits exceed US $1.2 million in Years 4 and 5, the debt-to-equity ratio&#13;
declines to 0.5:1 by the end of Year 5.&#13;
Current Status and Schedule for Registration&#13;
2.9          The final corporate structure is still being negotiated with the objective that the&#13;
company will be private and that shares held by public institutions will not exceed 49%. The&#13;
following participants are envisaged as shareholders:&#13;
(a)   The Institute for Oilbearing Crops in Zaporizhzhia. The institute owns&#13;
approximately 25% of the stock.&#13;
(b)   A company formed by kolkhozes converted into cooperatives or joint stock&#13;
companies. These farns are producers of hybrid seeds.&#13;
(c)   Company of private individuals.&#13;
(d)   UkrAgroBusiness (UAB) and RAIS, private joint-stock enterprises under the laws&#13;
of Ukraine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2B                                                                      55&#13;
(e)   Foreign company(ies).&#13;
2.10        To accelerate the fonnation of the company, the Ukrainian partners may form a&#13;
"nucleus" company first, but have a stipulation in the shareholder agreement which allows for&#13;
the restructuring with foreign participation within one year from the date of registration. Under&#13;
this scenario, the nucleus company was registered in February 1995.&#13;

ANNEX 2C&#13;
PROFILES ON SEED ENTERPRISES&#13;
C. Sugarbeet Seed Production Company&#13;
2.1           The company will be formed as a private company with limited liability under the&#13;
laws of Ukraine, and will be located in Trostianets (near Sumy). The company's highest body&#13;
will be the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. They will approve the annual report, any changes&#13;
to the statutes and to the capital structure of the company, and will elect a Board of Directors,&#13;
the Chairman, and the auditors. The Board of Directors will meet quarterly and supervise the&#13;
activities of management. All operating plans, investment plans, budgets, and real estate&#13;
transactions, as well as the appointment and dismissal of the General Director, have to be&#13;
approved by the Board.&#13;
Company Activities&#13;
2.2           The company plans to produce annually about 40,000 units (100,000 seeds per&#13;
unit) of foundation seed and about 1 million units of hybrid sugarbeet seed and sell it in Ukraine&#13;
and in export markets. To this end, the company will enter into licensing agreements with&#13;
breeders for the right to produce and market hybrids developed by these breeders.&#13;
2.3           The company will refurbish an existing sugarbeet seed conditioning facility in&#13;
Trostianets. The land and buildings belong to the UAAS, and the company will gain access to&#13;
these facilities, either by UAAS contribution to the capitalization of the firm or through a long-&#13;
term lease for this property. All buildings are brick structures and in good condition.&#13;
2.4           The company will enter into production contracts for 40,000 units of foundation&#13;
seed with the experimental farms of the Institute for Sugarbeet. These farms will manage the&#13;
production in the field and will dry the seed after the harvest. The seed will then be delivered&#13;
to the conditioning facility. To produce hybrid seed, the company will contract with farms&#13;
which have drying capability for the seed after harvest, and which will deliver the dried seed&#13;
to the facility at Trostianets.&#13;
2.5           Modern sugarbeet seed production employs two distinct technologies in the field,&#13;
since the sugarbeet is a plant which produces its seed only in the second year (the plants need&#13;
to be vernalized). These technologies are the steckling method and the direct planting method."5&#13;
15    Steckling Method. This is the traditional technology, which involves transplanting. In the fall of the first&#13;
year, the young plants are uprooted and stored in a covered pile and protected against severe frost. They are&#13;
then replanted the following spring, and seeds can be harvested early in the fall of the second year. Direct&#13;
Planting Method. This is a more recent technology, which can only be used only in environments with relatively&#13;
mild winters (outside of the traditional sugarbeet growing areas). The seeds are planted late in the summer of&#13;
(continued...)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62                                                          Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
The company plans to engage both methods of production. About 70% of the hybrid seeds will&#13;
be produced in the south of Ukraine using the direct planting method, and about 30% will be&#13;
produced in the traditional sugarbeet growing area with the steckling method. However, all&#13;
foundation seed will be produced with the steckling method.&#13;
2.6            Sugarbeet seed conditioning involves sophisticated methods for applying seed&#13;
protectants; they are known as "encrusting" and "pelletizing""7. The conditioning facility at&#13;
Trostianets will be equipped with both technologies, so that the company can successfully&#13;
compete with Western companies using modem technology in the domestic and the export&#13;
markets.&#13;
2.7           The company will market its seed through distributors and dealers, as well as&#13;
through licensees. About 51% of the company's hybrid seeds will be sold in Ukraine,&#13;
representing a market share of about 10% (this percentage is expected to increase to about 25-30&#13;
percent as the market shrinks because of the use of improved seeds and resulting lower seeding&#13;
rates). All the company's foundation seed will be used in Ukraine: 75% will be used by the&#13;
company for the production of commercial seed and 25% will be sold to other hybrid seed&#13;
producers; hybrid seeds produced by these producers may represent about 11 % of the market&#13;
share.&#13;
Financial Projections&#13;
2.8           The financial projections for the sugarbeet enterprise, attached to this Annex,&#13;
indicate that the company will be profitable in the first year of seed sales. Net profit after tax&#13;
in years 5-10 is estimated at about US $3.5 million per year. However, prior to its first selling&#13;
season, the company will have to finance the initial investment in plant and auxiliary agricultural&#13;
equipment and seed production, which will require significant borrowings in local currency.&#13;
These borrowings are projected to peak at an equivalent of about US $7.3 million in the second&#13;
16( . continued)&#13;
the first year, the young plantings remain in the ground over winter, and seed is harvested in the early fall of&#13;
the second year. Direct planting generally produces a much higher quality seed (with better germination and&#13;
vigor), but it involves a greater risk of losing the seed crop to frost if very cold temperatures attack the young&#13;
plantings. In Westem Europe, more than 90% of sugarbeet seed production today uses the direct planting&#13;
method.&#13;
17     Sugarbeer seed treatment technology. While almost all sugarbeet seed produced in Ukraine today is sold&#13;
.naked" (chemicals are only applied in dust form), all Western companies are either 'encrusting" their seeds&#13;
(the chemicals are applied with an adhesive), or they are pelletizing them (producing uniform round pellets,&#13;
chemicals also having been applied with an adhesive). Both of these methodologies provide better protection for&#13;
the seed than the way in which seed is currently treated in Ukraine; they are more efficient in the dosage of the&#13;
chemicals and thus environmentally friendlier. Pelletized seeds require more moisture in the soil to germinate.&#13;
Hence, the market for pelletized seeds in Ukraine is limited to the western sugarbeet growing areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Anne-x 2C                                                                          63&#13;
quarter of the project's first year of operation and to cease in Year 3 (see attached projected cash&#13;
flow).&#13;
2.9          The debt-to-equity ratio for the sugarbeet enterprise starts at a level of just over&#13;
1.5:1 in the first year of operation and declines to less than 1:1 by Year 4. The fairly low initial&#13;
ratio (compared to the maize seed enterprise) reflects the lower investment needed to establish&#13;
the enterprise's operations (US $5 million), an initial capitalization of US $1.75 million, and&#13;
net profits exceeding US $0.8 million in the first year of operation. The initial level of&#13;
capitalization is equivalent to the initial contributions of the domestic partners of about US $1.5&#13;
million (including an investment by UAB of US $0.5 million).  At least half of these&#13;
contributions would be paid in cash. After restructuring with the foreign partner by the end of&#13;
the first year of operation, the total level of capitalization would be brought up to at least US&#13;
$1.75 million. Since the sugarbeet enterprise's annual net profits exceed US $1.8 million in&#13;
Years 4-5 of the project's operation, the debt-to-equity ratio declines to 0.5:1 by the end of Year&#13;
5.&#13;
Current Status and Schedule for Registration&#13;
2.10         The final corporate structure is still being negotiated with the objective that the&#13;
company will be private and that shares held by public institutions will not exceed 49%. The&#13;
following participants are envisaged as shareholders:&#13;
(a)    The Institute for Sugarbeet in Kiev and its associated Experimental Farms.&#13;
Together they hold less than 30% of the stock.&#13;
(b)   A group of seed producers and a group of seed customers (all kolkhozes converted&#13;
into cooperatives or joint stock companies, or private farmers). Together these&#13;
groups hold about 10% of the stock.&#13;
(c)   Privatized plants from UKRSACHAR. They hold about 5 % of the stock.&#13;
(d)   Private individuals. They will hold about 40% of the stock.&#13;
(e)    Foreign companies, which are in the process of being identified. They will hold&#13;
about 15% of the stock.&#13;
2.11         To accelerate the formation of the company, the Ukrainian partners may form a&#13;
"nucleus" company first, but have a stipulation in the shareholder agreement which allows for&#13;
the restructuring with foreign participation within one year from the date of registration. Under&#13;
this scenario, the nucleus company was registered in February 1995. The two foreign joint-&#13;
venture partners are currently negotiating with the nucleus company about the levels of their&#13;
shareholdings in the future expanded seed enterprise.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIc ANALYSIS&#13;
Financial Analysis&#13;
4.1           The financial analysis of the project is based on the financial projections for the three seed&#13;
enterprises presented in Annexes 2A, 2B and 2C. It focuses on the returns to investment in each of the&#13;
three seed conditioning plants. The accounts for these plants are broken down into the costs and revenues&#13;
for the first six years of their operation, starting with the year that the initial investments are made. For&#13;
the purposes of the analysis, years 7 and beyond are taken as having the same revenue and cost structure&#13;
as in year 6. Accounts are separated into local and foreign currency, with all taxes paid in local&#13;
currency.&#13;
4.2          Investment costs are separated into new plant equipment and civil works. Recurrent costs&#13;
are separated into seed provided to farmers, seed of the next generation purchased from farms growing&#13;
on contract for the conditioning plants, chemicals, transport, conditioning, royalties, and marketing. All&#13;
costs and revenues are presented as the multiplication of their quantity and unit cost or price components.&#13;
All unit recurrent costs for seed, conditioning, chemicals, and transport are expressed in terms of local&#13;
or foreign currency spent for the amount of the input required to produce 1 unit of output. Royalties and&#13;
marketing costs are calculated as shares of total sales. Aside from the initial investments and chemicals&#13;
used in conditioning, all costs are in local currency.&#13;
4.3           The output levels of each of the plants at full development in the sixth year are expected&#13;
to reach 4,000 tons for hybrid sunflower seed, 1,500 tons of hybrid sugarbeet seed, and 6,950 tons of&#13;
hybrid maize seed.&#13;
4.4           Each plant's output mix between foundation and Fl hybrid sales changes over the six-year&#13;
period. At the sugarbeet seed enterprise, foundation (elite) seed production falls about 20% over six&#13;
years, while Fl hybrid seed production (including pelletized form) almost doubles. For the maize plant,&#13;
foundation seed becomes more important (higher output and large share of output) with time. For&#13;
sunflower seeds, production of foundation (elite) seeds grows, but the share of elite seeds in total output&#13;
falls over the period. For the sugarbeet and maize plants, exports grow in terms of quantity by about&#13;
30% over six years. Exports of seed for sunflower are zero in the first two years, but rise to 1,000 tons&#13;
by year 6, accounting for 25% of production by then.&#13;
4.5           Data on local costs and output prices were gathered in March 1994. Subsequently they&#13;
have been updated to the levels of December 1994 and translated into foreign currency (U.S. dollars)&#13;
when necessary at the rate of 130,000 karbovantsi per U.S. dollar.&#13;
4.6           Two factors which affect the seed plants' financial viability and cash flow are the&#13;
imposition of a foreign exchange surrender and a value added tax (VAT) on imported and domestic&#13;
equipment and on all other inputs. The foreign exchange surrender of 50% of hard currency revenues&#13;
at an interbank currency exchange rate, which is about 80% of the commercial rate, amounts to tax on&#13;
export sales of 10%. The small share of imported inputs in variable costs amounts to a smnall hard&#13;
currency requirement for the operation of the plants. Hence, the foreign exchange surrender does not&#13;
impede the enterprises' operation. Nevertheless, the financial rates of return on invested capital (FRR)&#13;
are ultimately reduced by any surrender requirement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76                                                        Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
4.7           The VAT on imported equipment has a small effect on the FRR because the VAT paid&#13;
on imports is credited against VAT to be paid on final sales. The large size of the investments relative&#13;
to sales, their concentration in year I of the project, and the relatively high VAT of 20% all combine to&#13;
generate a sizeable negative impact on the enterprises' cash flow. Large local currency financing gaps&#13;
arise in the enterprises' first year of operation (VAT is paid in local currency), ranging from the&#13;
equivalent of US $4 million to US $8 million. These financing gaps are compensated by local sales in&#13;
the first year of operations.&#13;
4.8           The base levels of after tax FRR for the investments made in each of the plants, with the&#13;
surrender of 50% of foreign exchange earnings and VAT of 20% on domestic sales, range from 29% for&#13;
the sugarbeet seed enterprise, to 25% for both the maize seed and sunflower seed operations,&#13;
respectively. The calculation of these rates assumes that the investmnents are actually made before the first&#13;
year of operation and that the receipts of year 1 operations are received at the end of year 1. (Table A&#13;
4.1).&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
4.9           The economic analysis of the project focuses on the quantifiable benefits resulting from&#13;
the domestic utilization of the hybrid seed produced by the three seed enterprises. Additional benefits&#13;
will arise from the training and investments made in germplasm  maintenance and the regulatory&#13;
framework, but are beyond measurement as they involve boosting capital resources (both physical and&#13;
human) in the seed research and certification areas. The investments, technical assistance, and training&#13;
in these areas (including management training at the seed enterprises) total roughly US $5 million and&#13;
are included in the overall stream of costs in the economic analysis. In an effort to conservatively&#13;
estimate the economic rate of return (ERR) on project investments, no benefits from the public sector&#13;
investment and technical assistance are added to the project's benefit stream.&#13;
4.10          The economic benefits calculated from the seed enterprises' activities are limited to the&#13;
ones generated by hybrid seed production. The benefits from production of foundation seeds are not&#13;
included in the analysis because they are relatively small and difficult to calculate. Benefits from Fl&#13;
hybrids produced by the project are examined through their effects on seeding rates and yields of the&#13;
crops they produce.&#13;
4.11          Seeding rates on farms throughout Ukraine are relatively high for sugarbeet, corn, and&#13;
sunflower because of the low quality of hybrid seed. Not all the batches of hybrid seed currently used&#13;
are actually hybrid seed, and seeding rates are consequently 30-50% higher than in Western countries.&#13;
With the level of purity of hybrid seed greatly improved by the seed enterprises in the project, the amount&#13;
of seed produced by these enterprises will allow a larger area to be planted with a given amount of seed.&#13;
The incremental area that can be seeded is the first type of economic benefit. The second, which arises&#13;
from the enterprises' seed quality improvements, is associated with higher yields from improved seed.&#13;
Currently, the yields for sugarbeet and maize are less than half of Western European levels; sunflower&#13;
yields are relatively higher, but are still only 60-70% of Western European yield levels. With higher-&#13;
quality seeds, Ukrainian yields for these crops would be improved substantially.&#13;
4.12          Both the reduction of seeding rates and improvement of crop yields associated with&#13;
higher-quality seeds produced by the project's three enterprises are also a function of the availability and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4                                                                                    77&#13;
quality of other inputs used. It is not assumed that the input supply situation would appreciably improve&#13;
over the life of the project and the assumed limited yet tangible progress in seeding rates and yields would&#13;
be relieved by using currently available agricultural technology.&#13;
4.13          Seeding rates are expected to drop 10-20% over a six-year period (depending on the&#13;
particular crop) by using the project's improved seed. Yield increases are estimated to reach 7-20 % over&#13;
the same six-year period, but starting only in the project's third year of operation. (Maize yields improve&#13;
the most, while sunflower yields rise only 2% per year for the four years). The yield increases pertain&#13;
mainly to the area seeded in the base year with the project's year 1 seed. Since incremental areas can&#13;
be seeded with the seed saved through reduced seeding rates, the output raised on these areas is counted&#13;
as a project benefit. The higher yields attained on these incremental areas is counted as a second-round&#13;
project benefit.&#13;
4.14          In this way, the incremental output produced from the improved seed of the project's&#13;
three enterprises is set off against the project's incremental costs, with the latter including all the project's&#13;
investment in plant, equipment, civil works, training, and technical assistance. The first six years of&#13;
project benefits are quantified in crop output and then translated into monetary terms by pricing the crops&#13;
at border prices for these crops. The border prices for these crops are expected to rise over time from&#13;
their current levels of roughly one-third of world market price levels to about 75 % of world market levels&#13;
by the end of year 6. This growth of border prices (by about 15% per year) is meant to reflect Ukraine's&#13;
increasing linkage to world markets and the consequent improvement of farm-gate prices with the&#13;
emergence of regional and national markets.&#13;
4.15          Comparing the stream of economic benefits from improved hybrid seeds with the total&#13;
costs for all project components, the project yields a rate of return of 19% per year, generating a net&#13;
present value of net project benefits of US $53 million (Table A 4.2).&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis of Financial and Economic Rates of Return&#13;
4.16          The sensitivity analysis carried out measures the impact of project variables which are&#13;
subject to uncertainty. These variables include the enterprises' sales volumes (physical) and sales prices,&#13;
project costs, production delays, surrender requirements for foreign exchange, reduction in seeding rates,&#13;
increases in crop yields, and increases in border prices. The adopted methodology for the sensitivity&#13;
analyses simulates percentage reductions and increases from these variables' base levels and measure the&#13;
effects of these changes on the financial rates of return of each seed plant and on the economic rate of&#13;
return of the project. A parameter of 15% return is used as the minimum acceptable rate of return for&#13;
project financial and economic results.&#13;
4.17          Financial Analysis. The level of sales and sales prices in each plant's financial analysis&#13;
were varied to simulate revenues below those forecast in the base scenarios. All quantities of production&#13;
and sales (including exports) and all output prices were reduced by the same rates from the levels they&#13;
take on in the project's base scenario. Sugarbeet seed output and sales prices could each fall by 11%&#13;
before this threshold parameter is reached; the comparable decreases for the maize seed and sunflower&#13;
seed enterprises are 12 and 8%, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                                                        Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
4.18          A scenario of cost overruns on investments in plant and equipment and in recurrent costs&#13;
was examined. Its results show that cost overruns can reach between 14-21 % for the sugarbeet seed,&#13;
maize seed, and sunflower seed enterprises before the FRRs in these activities fall to the threshold 15%&#13;
level. A scenario designed to measure the impact of delaying plant operation by one year after making&#13;
initial investments in the plants and equipment was also examined. The results reveal that an additional&#13;
year of start-up time does not reduce the enterprises' FRRs to levels below the threshold 15% level.&#13;
Finally, the removal of the foreign exchange surrender policy, that is, allowing all the income from&#13;
export sales to be changed into domestic currency at the commercial rate, would improve the enterprises'&#13;
FRRs, by between 1-3%.&#13;
4.19          All the sensitivity analyses reveal that the financial results of the three seed enterprises&#13;
are robust with regard to reductions in receipts of 8-12%, cost overruns of 14-21%, and delays of up&#13;
to a year in bringing the plants on line.&#13;
4.20          Economic Analysis. The sensitivity analysis of the economic returns of the project&#13;
examines how the ERR responds to changes in assumptions about the benefits stream. The key variables&#13;
affecting the benefits stream are the reduction in seeding rates, the increase in yields, and the level of&#13;
maize, sugarbeet and sunflower prices. These three variables are varied together by the same percentage&#13;
decrease.&#13;
4.21          The sensitivity analysis of the ERR reveals that a threshold of 15% rate of return is still&#13;
attained when the key variables tested are reduced from their base values by 9% each. Recalling that the&#13;
base values for the reduction in seeding rates and increase in crop yields were conservatively set, their&#13;
reduction by 9% represents an even more conservative estimate of project benefits. Moreover, the&#13;
simultaneous reduction in yield increases and output prices (combined with seeding rates that fall less&#13;
rapidly) represents more than a 20% reduction in the value of incremental output arising under the&#13;
project. When these key variables are increased from base levels by 9% each, the ERR would rise to&#13;
23%.&#13;

ANNEX 5&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO REVIEW&#13;
THE AGRICULTURE RESEARCH SYSTEM&#13;
Background&#13;
The agricultural research system in Ukraine still retains many of the organizational and structural&#13;
features of the FSU system. Reorganized in 1990 and administered by the newly established Ukrainian&#13;
Academy of Agricultural Sciences (UAAS), the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (UAS), the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and Food (MOAF), and the Ministry of Forestry (MOFR), it is entirely public. The&#13;
agricultural research system is not well integrated in the system of higher agricultural education, and its&#13;
international isolation is only slowly diminishing. In terms of physical facilities and staff employed, it is&#13;
probably oversized and unsustainable, especially under current fiscal circumstances. It focuses heavily&#13;
on basic research and on biological and technical problems, areas in which it has achieved considerable&#13;
success. Research efforts in economic, financial, organization, and managerial aspects of agriculture have&#13;
been less intensive and effective and need to be strengthened and adjusted to the needs of a pluralistic&#13;
enterprise structure. Most importantly, the national research system is currently faced with a profound&#13;
financial crisis resulting from the country's economic and fiscal difficulties, which calls for short-term&#13;
remedial actions and reforms if collapse is to be avoided.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The objective of the Agricultural Research Review is to prepare a proposal for rationalizing the&#13;
national agricultural research system to enable it to respond efficiently and effectively to the development&#13;
needs of and agreed priorities for the agriculture sector. This would include the following:&#13;
(a)    defining a research policy and strategy in terms of the research system's goals,&#13;
objectives, and priorities; defining organization and management; defining private and&#13;
public sector responsibilities; defining size and financing, particularly of the public sector&#13;
research; and establishing research evaluation criteria;&#13;
(b)   identifying a short- and medium-term reform program for adjusting the structure of the&#13;
national agricultural research system and its research programs to the short- and medium-&#13;
term needs of the sector; and&#13;
(c)    elaborating a detailed plan for implementing this short- and medium-term  reform&#13;
program.&#13;
Scope and Structure of the Review&#13;
The review would include both basic and applied research and would cover the technical,&#13;
institutional, economic, and social aspects of the crop, livestock, forestry, and fishery subsectors. It&#13;
would have five main components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                                                        Ukraine Seed Development Project&#13;
(a)    Analysis of the existing agricultural research system;&#13;
(i)    organizational structure;&#13;
(ii)   financing;&#13;
(iii)  inventory of existing research facilities, and programs or projects and employed&#13;
human resources;&#13;
(iv)   prioritization, planning, and coordination procedures;&#13;
(v)    management of human, physical, and financial resources;&#13;
(vi)   dissemination of research results;&#13;
(vii)   monitoring and evaluation of research process and results; and&#13;
(viii)  linkages with other domestic and international research and education systems.&#13;
(b)    Past performance of the agricultural research system measured against former objectives&#13;
and its capacity to meet the future needs of agriculture;&#13;
(c)    Definition of a policy and strategy for the national agricultural research system,&#13;
considering the following;&#13;
(i)    performance of the existing system;&#13;
(ii)   agriculture's agreed economic, social, and environmental role;&#13;
(iii)  the ongoing technical, economic, financial, and organizational transformation of&#13;
Ukrainian agriculture; and&#13;
(iv)   the need for responsiveness to changing research needs, accountability, internal&#13;
efficiency, effectiveness, and reduced fiscal dependency.&#13;
(d)    Elaboration of a program for restructuring the existing research system and identification&#13;
of short- and medium-term research priorities;&#13;
(e)    Preparation of a detailed "plan of operation" for restructuring the research system and&#13;
for implementing the identified short- and medium-term research program;&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
The responsibility for the review would be with the UAAS. The UAAS would be assisted by a&#13;
team of suitably qualified internationally recruited consultants. The team leader of this group of&#13;
consultants would visit Ukraine to prepare for the pertinent Ukrainian authorities a work program and&#13;
detailed Terms of Reference, including a plan for the organization and implementation of the review. It&#13;
is suggested that the detailed Terms of Reference would be cleared by a high-level steering committee&#13;
to be established for overseeing and guiding the review; this committee would also be responsible for&#13;
approval of the recommendations emerging from the review. This group should consist of a representative&#13;
each from the UAAS, the UAS, the MOAF, the MOFR, the State Committee for Science and&#13;
Technology, and the principal agricultural universities, and should include the leader of the group of&#13;
foreign consultants assisting Ukraine in the review. Special working groups would have to be established&#13;
to cover the various topics under review. The groups should discuss their findings, before presenting&#13;
them to the steering commnittee, in a workshop which would include a wider audience of related&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5                                                                            83&#13;
institutions and research clients, in order to obtain as broad a consensus as possible on the conclusions&#13;
and recommendations.&#13;
Upon acceptance of the recommendations of the working groups by the steering committee, the&#13;
latter would charge a drafting committee headed by the leader of the consultants' team with the&#13;
production of a report and would submit it to the Cabinet of Ministers for consideration and approval.&#13;
The Bank would be given an opportunity to conmment on the document.&#13;
The review would be expected to start in mid 1995 and be completed before early 1996.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
FOR FOREIGN TRAING OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENTISTS&#13;
UNDER THE GERMPLASM MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
Training in a reputable Western institution (research institute, agricultural university, or&#13;
seed development company) would be provided under the project for key scientific personnel of the&#13;
sugarbeet, sunflower, and maize germplasm development program of the Sugarbeet Research Institute&#13;
in Kiev, Oilseeds Research Institute in Zaporizhzhia, and Plant Breeding and Genetics Research Institute&#13;
in Odesa. It is proposed that the program leader (or his deputy) of the germplasm development program&#13;
of each of the research institutes would undergo training for about one month, while the chief breeder&#13;
and the chief seed production agronomist (or those second in command to them) would receive training&#13;
for about eight and three months, respectively. In the case of the breeders, the objective is to allow the&#13;
selected candidates to train over a full cropping season, starting with preparation of field works, crossing&#13;
and isolation techniques, observations, screenings, and recordings during the whole vegetation period,&#13;
as well as harvesting and evaluation of the genetic materials. In the case of the seed production&#13;
agronomist, it would be important for him to be exposed to high-quality harvesting (low loss, low&#13;
damage), drying, and other post-harvest handling of the crop. Certain circumstances (such as lack of&#13;
kmowledge of a foreign language, advanced age, and health conditions) might prevent some of the&#13;
institute's personnel from participating in foreign training. In such a case, the director of the research&#13;
institute, together with the program leader and the chief of the PMU, would decide on another suitable&#13;
scientist of the program whose training would guarantee the most benefits to the program. Implementation&#13;
of the training program would be administered by the PMU.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO REVIEW&#13;
THE PLANT VARIETY TEsTING SYSTEM&#13;
Background&#13;
The responsibility for plant variety testing in Ukraine rests with the State Commission for&#13;
Testing and Protection of Plant Varieties (SCTPPV) which reports to the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Food (MOAF). In addition to determining, on some 200 trial locations, the characteristics of plant&#13;
varieties and their value for cultivation, the SCTPPV also provides extension trials and farms some&#13;
18,000 hectares of agricultural land. Its investment needs and operating costs are currently financed&#13;
by budgetary allocations from the Government, testing fees paid by plant breeders, and income from&#13;
its farming operations.&#13;
There are clear indications that the system, as currently organized, does not meet its objective&#13;
in a cost-effective way. The principal issues include (a) the scope of SCTPPV's activities, especially&#13;
the engagement in extension trials and in its extensive farming operations; (b) the effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency of carrying out its core responsibility for variety testing, especially the need and&#13;
justification for the large number of trial locations for VCU and DUS testing; (c) the system's heavy&#13;
dependence on scarce public funding and possible revenues from its farming operations; and, (d) the&#13;
lack of a transparent accounting system as a management tool for ensuring efficiency and cost&#13;
effectiveness in carrying out SCTPPV's core responsibilities.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Review are to:&#13;
(a) analyze the plant variety trial and testing system as carried out by SCTPPV, especially the&#13;
rationale for the range of its activities, the efficiency and effectiveness of the variety trial&#13;
system, its current financing and the financial management of SCTPPV; and,&#13;
(b) propose improvements in the current system which would rationalize the range of&#13;
activities, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the trial system and increase the&#13;
system's self-financing capacity through user fee/cost recovery arrangements.&#13;
Scope and Structure of the Review&#13;
The Review would include these elements:&#13;
(a) Analysis of the current activities of the SCTPPV;&#13;
(i) responsibilities and scope of activities;&#13;
(ii) organizational structure and management;&#13;
(iii) inventory of available facilities and human resources;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5                                                                               89&#13;
(iv) operational cost and financing; and,&#13;
(v) current procedures for VCU and DUS testing regarding data collection, trial&#13;
locations, technical testing methods, statistical analysis and decisions on standards.&#13;
(b) Performance assessment of the plant variety testing system and identification of&#13;
problems/areas regarding (a) i-v; and,&#13;
(c) Preparation of specific recommendations for resolving the issues identified under (b)&#13;
above and ensuring an efficient and effective system of national trials and listing. These&#13;
recommendations would have to address, inter alia:&#13;
*   the need and justification for carrying out extension trials within the SCTPPV;&#13;
*   the minimum numbers of trial locations required for achieving reliable and&#13;
repeatable data for national listing (VCU) of the required range of species;&#13;
*   identification of suitable DUS testing stations;&#13;
*   the need for reducing the system's dependency on public funding through&#13;
introduction of user fees within a given time horizon; and,&#13;
*   the need for improvements in financial management of the system.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
T'he responsibility for the Review would be with the Deputy Minister of Agriculture&#13;
responsible for crop production. The Review would be carried out by two consultants who would be&#13;
assisted by the SCTPPV. Prior to arrival of the consultants, SCTPPV would propose a concise report&#13;
covering the topics listed under (a) above (analysis of the current activities of SCTPPV). The report&#13;
of the consultants and their recommendations would be submitted for review and approval to the&#13;
Deputy Prime Minister for the Agro-Industrial Complex. Upon approval by the Deputy Prime&#13;
Minister, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and the Chairman of the SCTPPV would prepare and&#13;
submit a specific time-bound plan for implementing the agreed recommendations. The Bank would be&#13;
given an opportunity to comment on the consultant's report and on the implementation plan before&#13;
they are finalized.&#13;
The Seed Development Project would finance a total of 40 working days for carrying out this&#13;
review. The two consultants would be required to have university degrees in agriculture or&#13;
agricultural botany and a minimum of ten years experience in managing and/or operating an official&#13;
national variety trial system. They would have to have jointly sufficient practical experience with&#13;
DUS/VCU work and in the organization and management of plant variety trials to effectively carry&#13;
out the technical, administrative, managerial and financial aspects of the assignment.&#13;
&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The principal objective of the Seed
            Development Project is to improve the national seed
            system's capacity to produce high quality seed
            efficiently. To meet the project's short term objective
            of improving the supply of quality seed for the domestic and
            export market, the project will provide financial and
            technical assistance for: 1) the development of three
            private enterprises specializing in the multiplication of
            domestic and imported parent hybrid seed for maize,
            sunflower, sugarbeet, and their processing and marketing;
            and b) the germplasm maintenance and development for three
            leading domestic suppliers of hybrid maize, sunflower, and
            sugarbeet seed. To help meet the project's medium term
            objective of developing a competitive seed system, the
            project will provide financial and technical assistance for:
            1) improving the regulatory framework for the seed system;
            2) the development of an agricultural research strategy and
            plan; and 3) the Ukrainian Institute for Agro-Ecology and
            Biotechnology. In addition to these specific interventions
            in the seed system, the liberalization of seed pricing,
            marketing, and trade implemented within the context of the
            Government's economic reform program, will establish
            the enabling policy environment to enhance the efficiency of
            the national seed system.
