This paper analyzes the 1978-81 foreign exchange crisis and 1982-90 medium-&#13;
term prospects for Turkey using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model&#13;
of the Turkish economy. Through a series of historical simulations, the model&#13;
attempts to capture the basic features of the 1978-81 foreign exchange&#13;
disequilibrium in Turkey and evaluate their role in the crisis. The model is&#13;
then used to undertake a series of forward runs for the 1982-90 period which&#13;
reflect alternative scenarios as to the success and viability of the ongoing&#13;
shift in Turkish development policy from inward-looking import substitution to&#13;
outward-focused export expansion.&#13;

1. Introduction&#13;
By 1978, Turkey was in the midst of the most serious foreign&#13;
exchange and economic crisis it had experienced in three decades.       Although&#13;
the Turkish economy appeared to weather the first oil price increase and&#13;
related international disruptions of the early 1970s with relative ease, the&#13;
high (over 7 percent) GDP growth rate sustained over the 1973-77 period was&#13;
largely attributable to increased foreign borrowing and favorable trends in&#13;
workers' remittances. With the onset of the second oil price increase in 1978&#13;
and 1979, the persistence of stagflation in Turkey's major trading partners,&#13;
and the growing strains in the Turkish economy (characterized by exchange rate&#13;
overvaluation and accelerating domestic inflation), the growth momentum of the&#13;
mid-1970s collapsed and Turkey entered a period of negative GDP growth and&#13;
severe foreign exchange rationing.   This stagnation continued until 1981 when&#13;
the remarkable 62 percent growth of exports (in dollars) alleviated the&#13;
foreign exchange shortage and permitted GDP growth of around 4 percent, which&#13;
has  continued   into  1982.    While   the  export-led  economic   recovery  is&#13;
attributable in part to the depressed level of domestic demand, another major&#13;
factor   is  the   government's   reorientation  towards   an  outward-oriented&#13;
development strategy, as embodied in the exchange rate reforms, import&#13;
liberalization and export subsidy programs implemented since early 1980.&#13;
This paper presents an analysis of the 1978-80 crisis period in&#13;
Turkey and an exploration of the feasibility and sustainability of the ongoing&#13;
export-led recovery.    We make use of the results derived from the latest&#13;
variant of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models that have increasingly&#13;
been applied to issues of policy choice and development strategy in developing&#13;
countries, including earlier applications to Turkey (see Dervis and Robinson&#13;
(1978) and (1982)) and Yugoslavia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Section 2 of the paper provides a brief introduction to the features&#13;
of the CGE model, which is supplemented by a more detailed description and&#13;
algebraic presentation in Appendix I.      The current version of the CGE model&#13;
incorporates a number of features that facilitate an historical examination of&#13;
the turbulent foreign exchange disequilibria of the 1978-80 period.       Turkish&#13;
authorities responded to the severe foreign exchange shortage by rationing&#13;
imports, resorting to a varying mix of quantitative controls and premia&#13;
schemes  to  restrict   imports.    The  CGE model   simulates  the  simultaneous&#13;
operation of both types of schemes, as well as producing measures of the total&#13;
"rents"   generated   by  such   rationing   mechanisms   and  their   impact  on&#13;
productivity and capacity utilization.&#13;
Section 3 presents an analysis of the 1978-81 historical period.&#13;
The historical antecedents to the recent crisis are described and the&#13;
macroeconomic characteristics of Turkey are contrasted with those of a sample&#13;
of twelve other middle-income countries (MICs).       Turkey is found to differ&#13;
substantially from the sample average with regards both to the low importance&#13;
of exports and imports in GDP (i.e. the degree of "openness") and to the&#13;
sizeable  share of agriculture     in both GDP and employment.      The economic&#13;
developments of the 1978-81 period are described in some detail, and the&#13;
features of the shift in development strategy that was first articulated in&#13;
the 1980 trade reforms are outlined.       Comparison of the sources of output&#13;
growth for 1978-81 with earlier periods reveals strong discontinuities in the&#13;
import   policies   adopted   by   the  government,   with   periods   of  import&#13;
liberalization   alternating   with   foreign   exchange   shortage   and  import&#13;
restriction.   The quantitative analysis is based on the fitting of the CGE&#13;
model to the 1978-81 period (or "validation"), and the subsequent simulation&#13;
of a number of counterfactual "alternative" scenarios designed to disentangle&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
the role of exogenous shocks and domestic policies in the economic performance&#13;
of the period.    Model simulations reveal that the "cost" to the economy of&#13;
delay in the adoption of the new outward-looking strategy was substantial, and&#13;
that the role of the oil price increase, while significant, was less important&#13;
than changes in the real exchange rate due to high domestic inflation in&#13;
bringing about the foreign exchange crisis.&#13;
Turning from historical analysis to medium-term projections, Section&#13;
4 of the paper presents a number of alternative scenarios for growth in the&#13;
Turkish economy during the 1982-90 period.     Based on the phenomenal growth of&#13;
exports during 1981 and 1982, and the high net inflow of foreign capital,&#13;
Turkey enters 1983 in a better situation than at any time since the early&#13;
1970s.   Using the CGE model,. this section develops a Forward Base Run that&#13;
assumes that the government adopts trade and domestic management policies that&#13;
will permit the ongoing shift to export-led growth to be successful, with&#13;
exports reaching nearly 20 percent of GDP by 1990, and that facilitate the&#13;
rapid growth of private investment, resulting not only in a drastic reduction&#13;
in the role of public investment but an overall increase in the share of&#13;
investment in GDP as well.    This Base Run is then contrasted with a number of&#13;
alternative forward scenarios, with special focus placed on the role of export&#13;
performance, productivity growth, exchange rate policy, and private investment&#13;
as critical determinants of economic performance in the coming decade.         The&#13;
macroeconomic implications of the various scenarios are considered, as well as&#13;
their impact on sectoral structure.     Finally, the feasibility of the Turkish&#13;
export orientation is considered by using the "demand sources of growth"&#13;
methodology to contrast the Turkish projections with the experience of other&#13;
countries pursuing export-led strategies.&#13;
Appendix I contains a detailed description and' algebraic summary of&#13;
the model, while Appendix II outlines the data sources used for the study.&#13;

2.  An Overview of the CGE Model I/&#13;
The current CGE model of Turkey is the latest in a long tradition of&#13;
non-linear, computable general equilibrium models that stem from the early&#13;
work of Johansen (1960).    In recent years, this class of models has been used&#13;
as instruments of planning and policy analysis in conjunction with World Bank&#13;
research and evaluation of the performance and prospects of developing&#13;
nations, including Bank Missions to Turkey in 1979 and 1982 and the Yugoslavia&#13;
Plan Review Mission in 1981-2/&#13;
The chief characteristic of a CGE model is that it simulates the&#13;
working of a market system in which prices vary in various markets (for&#13;
factors, products, and foreign exchange) in response to changes in supply and&#13;
demand conditions.    In contrast to the simpler, linear input-output models&#13;
that assume no change in relative prices, a CGE model permits the simulation&#13;
of the results of policy packages which operate through the price mechanism,&#13;
such as exchange rates, tariffs and export subsidies. Economic performance is&#13;
seen as the outcome of decentralized optimizing decisions made by producers&#13;
and consumers in response to market conditions, which in turn are influenced&#13;
by government policies, international economic conditions, and other exogenous&#13;
forces.&#13;
It is important to stress that a CGE model, like the simpler input-&#13;
output model, is primarily a simulation model to be used for planning&#13;
purposes, not a forecasting model.     It is intended to be applied to periods&#13;
long enough that market mechanisms can be expected to respond to changes in&#13;
1/ A more complete presentation of the model is contained in Appendix I.&#13;
2/ See, for example, World Bank (1980a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
market conditions. Within each period, the model reaches, a static equilibrium&#13;
solution in which all markets are modeled as clearing subject to specified&#13;
behavioral rules and parameter values.    This approach is in stark contrast to&#13;
standard macroeconomic forecasting models, which derive their results from&#13;
complex specifications as to the speed at which markets respond to changing&#13;
economic conditions, and the different structure of these adjustment lags in&#13;
various sectors of the economy.      The CGE model is thus not intended for&#13;
macroeconomic forecasting, but instead concentrates on the determination of&#13;
relative prices among sectors and on the structure of real variables in the&#13;
economy.   The model is Walrasian and hence only determines relative prices.&#13;
The selection of a numeraire or price normalization rule exogenously fixes the&#13;
absolute price level, so that a solution to the model yields sectoral prices&#13;
relative  to  the  specified aggregate price level.      The domestic rate of&#13;
inflation is also specified exogenously, and the real focus of the model is&#13;
further reflected in the complete absence of financial markets or monetary&#13;
variables.&#13;
Another consequence of the real focus of the model relates to the&#13;
exchange rate.    Just as the prices of outputs in all sectors are relative&#13;
prices, so too is the exchange rate treated as a relative price within the&#13;
model. What matters to the model is not the nominal level of the exchange&#13;
rate over time, but rather whether the exchange rate movements are greater or&#13;
less than the differential between domestic and world inflation.         If the&#13;
change in the nominal exchange rate from period to period just offsets&#13;
differential world and domestic inflation rates, this corresponds to a&#13;
constant real (or price level deflated) exchange rate.    Only if the change in&#13;
the exchange rate exceeds (falls short of) this differential will there be a&#13;
depreciation (appreciation) in the real exchange rate.     If one were to raise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
the estimate of domestic inflation for a certain period, and raise the nominal&#13;
exchange rate by the same proportion, this would have no impact on any of the&#13;
real variables in the model.&#13;
It is worth emphasizing at this point that the idea of markets&#13;
responding to changing economic conditions does not imply that markets are&#13;
"perfect" in the neoclassical sense.       Instead,  the model explicitly takes&#13;
account of rigidities and distortions in the economy, and attempts to model&#13;
them formally. For example, capital already in place in each sector is fixed,&#13;
with the capital stock modified only through the allocation of new investment,&#13;
and sectoral wages for each type of labor are required to conform to an&#13;
exogenously specified pattern embodying wage "distortions" existing in Turkish&#13;
labor markets.&#13;
When the model is operated intertemporally, it is necessary to&#13;
specify how the exogenous variables change over time. When the model is used&#13;
to examine future economic prospects, this implies forecasting the movement of&#13;
these exogenous variables.     In some cases    (e.g. employment growth),   these&#13;
forecasts can be derived from extrapolation of historical trends; in other&#13;
cases, (foreign capital inflows, investment allocation and levels), greater&#13;
judgement is required since the magnitudes are presumably quite dependent on&#13;
the performance of the economy itself, which in turn is responsive to the full&#13;
range of government policy instruments (the exchange rate, tariffs and&#13;
subsidies, tax policy).&#13;
This   last  point   deserves  further   emphasis.    All   projections&#13;
generated by the model are conditional on the specific policy packages&#13;
simulated and the projected levels of exogenous variables.      Government policy&#13;
plays a dominant role in the results, so that the choice among alternative&#13;
scenarios is contingent on the government undertaking all of the policies&#13;
simulated in the model.&#13;

3. The Turkish Economy: A Historical Analysis, 1978-81&#13;
A. Turkish Economic Performance, 1973-77: A Perspective&#13;
The 1973-77 period in Turkey can be aptly characterized by the&#13;
dramatic swing that occurred from a positive to a negative foreign exchange&#13;
balance.   Although foreign exchange crises had been associated with economic&#13;
cycles in the past, the crisis which culminated in 1977 was much more serious&#13;
than the previous ones, not only because of its magnitude, but also because of&#13;
the severe domestic and foreign economic disruptions that accompanied it.&#13;
Real GDP increased at an annual rate of 7.3 percent between 1970 and&#13;
1977 2.   This growth rate compares favorably with 6.0. percent growth rate&#13;
during  the 1960s.    Moreover,  a high GDP growth rate of 7.2 percent was&#13;
maintained during the Third Plan Period (1973-77), despite the first oil shock&#13;
and its aftermath.21    Although this high growth rate of real GDP was partly&#13;
attributable to government policies that insulated the Turkish economy and&#13;
postponed adjustment to changing world conditions, dramatic increases in&#13;
production in the industrial (mining, manufacturing and electricity, gas,&#13;
water) and services sectors did occur.      On the expenditure side, a rise in&#13;
fixed investment contributed the most to the growth of GDP. The accelerated&#13;
X24 Estimates of real GDP are calculated in terms of domestic prices. This&#13;
tends to overestimate the growth rate because the output of the&#13;
manufacturing sector, which was growing much faster than other sectors,&#13;
was overvalued in Turkey compared to the rest of the world during the&#13;
period concerned. See Balassa (1981), Appendix Table 1, who finds that&#13;
the GDP growth rate for the 1967-77 period is thus overestimated by 0.5&#13;
percentage points.&#13;
2/ However, the quality of economic growth might not have been improved&#13;
because of the following two reasons. First, the efficiency of investment&#13;
declined as reflected in an increase in incremental capital output ratios&#13;
from 2.6 in 1968-72 to 3.8 in 1973-77 (see Balassa (1981), p. 21).&#13;
Second, there was considerable accumulation of inventories as indicated by&#13;
an increase in their share in GDP from 0.9 per cent in 1973 to 2.5 percent&#13;
in 1977 (Table 3.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
growth rate of real GDP in the 1970-77 period was accompanied by a higher&#13;
domestic inflation rate, which accelerated steadily during the Third Plan&#13;
period to reach an average of 20 percent annually, in contrast to the relative&#13;
stability of the price level in the 1960s. However, this increase in domestic&#13;
inflation was not excessive in comparison with the experience of other&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
The growth rate of agricultural production lagged far behind the&#13;
rates in industry and services during the three plan periods, resulting in a&#13;
shift in the structure of production away from agriculture.      In 1962, at the&#13;
beginning of the first Five Year Plan, the shares of agriculture, industry and&#13;
services in GDP were 39.6, 21.4, and 39.0 percent respectively.      However, by&#13;
1977 the agricultural share had declined to 28.1 percent whereas the shares of&#13;
industry and services had increased to 26.1 and 45.8 percent.       Despite this&#13;
decline in the agriculture share of GDP, agricultural growth rates themselves&#13;
were quite respectable by international standards. Although the change in the&#13;
sectoral composition of employment shows a trend similar to that of output&#13;
production, the share of workers employed in the agricultural sector remained&#13;
high at 63.1 percent in 1977, while the employment shares of industry and&#13;
services were 11.9 and 25.0 percent.&#13;
The rapid growth of real GDP in the 1973-77 period stemmed largely&#13;
from the growth of investment, as Table 3.1 illustrates.       During the period&#13;
the annual growth rate of real gross investment more than doubled from the&#13;
1968-72 period to reach 15.0 percent.      Public investment leaped from a 5.4&#13;
percent annual growth rate in 1968-72 to 17.9 percent in 1973-77.      During the&#13;
1973-77 period total consumption grew at 6.6 percent annually, while exports&#13;
actually declined by 3.7 percent per year.     As a result, the shares of gross&#13;
fixed investment, consumption and exports in real GDP were 24.7, 78.4 and&#13;
&#13;

5.0 percent in 1977. The share of imports in GDP increased slightly from 10.0&#13;
percent in 1973 to 10.6 percent in 1977.        The overall composition of the&#13;
allocation of investment, which emphasized the industrial sector and related&#13;
infrastructure because of the industrialization policy, stayed largely&#13;
unchanged.   In the Third Plan Period the transport and communications sectors&#13;
received a larger share of investment whereas the shares of energy, health,&#13;
education and housing declined. Such a trend is observed for both public and&#13;
private investment.    Although gross domestic savings grew significantly, at&#13;
8.8 percent annually in the 1973-77 period, it was not enough to finance gross&#13;
investment, which was increasing at an even higher rate.       Consequently, the&#13;
investment-savings gap increased to 9.4 percent of GDP in 1977 from -2.5&#13;
percent in 1972.     This potentially disastrous resource gap was filled by&#13;
increased foreign borrowing.&#13;
&#13;

The balance of payments situation reversed during the 1973-1977&#13;
period.   In 1973, although the balance of trade (goods and services) was in&#13;
deficit at $592 million, this was more than offBet by the inflow of workers'&#13;
remittances and net factor service income which resulted in a $515 million&#13;
current account surplus (see Figure 3.3 below). However, the subsequent rapid&#13;
increase in imports coupled with a reduction in exports increased the trade&#13;
deficit to $3.88 billion U.S. dollars in 1977.     One of the important factors&#13;
contributing to the deterioration of the trade balance seems to be the&#13;
appreciation of the real exchange rate during the period.'/ In addition to the&#13;
unfavorable balance of trade situation, a substantial decline in workers'&#13;
remittances and net factor service income contributed to a record high current&#13;
account deficit of $3.572 billion.      In order to finance the deficit, the&#13;
Turkish authorities resorted to heavy reliance on short-term international&#13;
capital markets.     In 1977,  Turkish exports consisted largely of food and&#13;
livestock and raw materials, whereas its imports were mostly manufactured&#13;
goods and mineral fuels.    The export structure remained fairly stable between&#13;
1970 and 1977, with the share of manufactured goods increasing slightly at the&#13;
expense of raw materials.     A significant increase in the share of mineral&#13;
fuels (petroleum) was observed in the import structure.&#13;
In analyzing the foreign exchange crisis that began in 1977, one has&#13;
to bear in mind the unprecedented occurrences in the international environment&#13;
during the 1973-77 period.     One was the "oil shock," which quadrupled the&#13;
price of oil in 1974.      Another important development was the existence of&#13;
stagflation in the industrial countries, caused primarily by the oil shock and&#13;
subsequent contractionary policies pursued by most of the countries.      Against&#13;
24 According to Balassa (1981), the real exchange rate with Turkey's trading&#13;
partners appreciated by 13.2 percent between 1973 and 1977 (Table 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
this background, the Turkish economy was growing relatively rapidly.&#13;
Naturally, the balance of trade situation worsened because of sluggish export&#13;
demand abroad, the increased cost of imports due to higher oil prices, and&#13;
higher import demand arising from sustained economic expansion. Moreover, the&#13;
current account balance also deteriorated because of reduced workers'&#13;
remittances, which could be attributed both to the recession in European&#13;
countries and to the increasing overvaluation of the exchange rate.&#13;
Dervis and Robinson have analyzed the important factors which led to&#13;
the foreign exchange crisis in 1977 utilizing an earlier version of the CGE&#13;
modelA.'   Specifically, the impact of several major macroeconomic events on&#13;
the exchange rate was examined.     Five different experiments were performed&#13;
starting from a base run which replicated historical developments:&#13;
Exp.1 = base run and a flexible exchange rate and more moderate borrowing,&#13;
Exp.2 = Exp.1 and moderate inflation,&#13;
Exp.3 = Exp.2 and no oil price increase,&#13;
Exp.4 = Exp.3 and no investment rate increase,&#13;
Exp.5 = Exp.4 and higher remittances.&#13;
The first experiment provides the "equilibrium" exchange rate, and the&#13;
exchange rates obtained from the other experiments are compared to this&#13;
equilibrium exchange rate to examine the influence of particular economic&#13;
events. Their estimates show that the contribution of various factors to the&#13;
depreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate from 1973-77 are as follows:&#13;
differential domestic and world inflation rates, 32 percent; the oil price&#13;
increase, 12 percent; the increase in the investment rate, 5 percent; the&#13;
decrease in worker's remittances, 21 percent; and other factors, 29 percent.&#13;
1/ See Dervis and Robinson (1978) and Dervis and Robinson (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
The higher inflation rate in Turkey relative to that in other countries is&#13;
thus shown to have contributed the most to the devaluation of the equilibrium&#13;
exchange rate.    However,  this effect only captures about one-third of the&#13;
total equilibrium devaluation, so that simple calculations of the required&#13;
devaluation based on comparative inflation rates would have been quite&#13;
wrong.   Dervis and Robinson concluded from the experiments that even if there&#13;
had been no unfavorable external developments (i.e., no oil price increase and&#13;
no decline in workers' remittances), the foreign exchange crisis would have&#13;
appeared anyway, albeit at a later date, because of growing strains in the&#13;
domestic economy due to the economic policies being followed.&#13;
B. Comparison with Other Middle Income Countries&#13;
In order to provide a benchmark for analyzing economic projections,&#13;
it is important to examine how the Turkish economy has been performing in the&#13;
last two decades compared to other middle income countries (MICs). Table 3.2&#13;
presents various economic indicators for Turkey and for the simple average of&#13;
12 other middle income countries for the years 1960, 1970 and 1977.       1977 is&#13;
the latest year for which data for all the countries are available from the&#13;
World Tables II.    The comparison of Turkey with the average results of the&#13;
other MICs highlights Turkey's performance relative to a diverse group of&#13;
countries; individual comparisons can be made using the data in Appendix Table&#13;
II-9. 2/&#13;
The population of Turkey has increased from 27.5 million to 41.9&#13;
million between 1960 and 1977, representing a 2.5 percent annual growth&#13;

rate.   These figures are very close to the averages for the other countries.&#13;
Per capita GNP for Turkey was $613 and $1,110 (1977 prices) in 1960 and 1977,&#13;
with Turkey ranking eighth and seventh among the 13 countries in the&#13;
respective  years.    The annual growth rate of per capita GNP for Turkey&#13;
increased from a below average rate of 3.3 percent in the 1960-70 period to&#13;
above average at 4.0 percent in the 1970-77 period.      In spite of its higher&#13;
growth rate in the 1970-77 period, GNP per capita in Turkey was only about 90&#13;
percent of the sample average for 1977, and Turkey moved up only one place in&#13;
the ranking.&#13;
In the next five columns of Table 3.2 and in Figures 3.1 and 3.2,&#13;
the shares of various economic aggregates in GDP are shown.        The first two&#13;
(shares of agriculture and manufacturing value added) are components of GDP in&#13;
production whereas the last three (shares of exports, imports and gross&#13;
domestic investment) are those of GDP in expenditure.       As Figure 3.1 shows,&#13;
the share of agricultural value added in GDP in Turkey declined substantially,&#13;
from 41.4 percent in 1960 to 29.0 percent in 1977.     However, these shares are&#13;
significantly higher than the sample average shares of 27.3 percent and 19.8&#13;
percent in those respective years.     In 1960, only Korea had a higher share&#13;
than Turkey while Egypt, Thailand and Colombia had higher shares than Turkey&#13;
in 1977.   Conversely, Turkey had the second lowest manufacturing share (12.0&#13;
percent) in 1960, only slightly higher than Korea (11.5 percent). However,&#13;
with the Korean industrialization drive of the 1960s and 1970s raising its&#13;
share to 23.2 percent in 1977, Turkey represented the least industrialized of&#13;
the  13   nations  in   1977,  with   only  17.5   percent  of  value  added   in&#13;
manufacturing.   While for the sample of MICs, the manufacturing share of GDP&#13;
had surpassed that of agriculture by 1970, in Turkey this reversal was not&#13;
reached even in 1977 (see Figure 3.1).&#13;

Turning to the expenditure side of GDP, the shares of exports,&#13;
imports and gross domestic investment in Turkey were lower than the respective&#13;
sample averages throughout the period.      This was especially notable on the&#13;
export side, where Turkey was the second lowest in 1960 with a 4.2 percent&#13;
share and the lowest in 1977 with a 5.6 percent share, which was less than a&#13;
third of the 18.5 percent average for the other countries in 1977. The import&#13;
share in GDP in Turkey almost doubled between 1960 and 1977, rising from 6.5&#13;
percent in 1960 (the second lowest after Brazil) to 12.3 percent in 1977&#13;
(higher than Mexico and Argentina, as well as Brazil).      As a result of this&#13;
more rapid increase in the import share compared to the export share, the&#13;
trade gap (import surplus) relative to GDP grew from 2.3 to 6.7 percent in&#13;
Turkey in the 1960-77 period.     Figure 3.2 illustrates that the role of both&#13;
exports and imports in the Turkish economy remained far less than in other&#13;
MICs throughout the 1960-77 period; in fact, as is evident from the figure,&#13;
the trade shares in Turkey in 1977 remained below those for the MIC sample in&#13;
1960.   The average trade gap/GDP ratio for other MICs rose more moderately&#13;
from an average of 1.6 to 3.0 percent between 1960 and 1977.        The share of&#13;
gross domestic investment in GDP in Turkey increased from 15.3 percent in 1960&#13;
to 22.4 percent in 1977, while the sample average shares were 19.5 and 23.9&#13;
percent.   Although the gross investment/GDP ratio in Turkey has been lower&#13;
than the average, the gap has been narrowing steadily over the two decade&#13;
period.&#13;
In sum, Turkey can be characterized as having growth rates of&#13;
population and real GNP per capita that are quite similar to those for other&#13;
MICs.   However,  the structure of both production and expenditure in Turkey&#13;
diverges substantially from the sample means.       The Turkish economy remains&#13;
much more oriented toward agriculture, although recent trends have reduced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
this to some extent.   Judging from the small shares of exports and imports in&#13;
GDP, Turkey still was virtually a closed economy in 1977.           Finally, the&#13;
traditional  Turkish   bias  towards  import  substitution   rather  than  export&#13;
expansion is evident in the very small export share, as well as the larger&#13;
than average trade gap.&#13;
C.  Recent Economic Events and Policy Reforms, 1978-81&#13;
In response to the growing foreign exchange crisis in 1977, the new&#13;
government under Prime Minister Ecevit undertook a stabilization program&#13;
beginning early in 1978, which met with only mixed success. While the current&#13;
account deficit improved markedly from $3.6 billion in 1977 to $1.7 billion in&#13;
1978, domestic inflation worsened as prices rose more than 50 percent. A new&#13;
stabilization program was announced in March 1979 and amplified in the&#13;
following months, culminating in a standby arrangement with the IMF in July&#13;
1979.   Despite these stringent measures, inflation accelerated to 64 percent&#13;
in 1979.    The balance of payments situation remained stable, with a $1.8&#13;
billion deficit on the current account.&#13;
On the trade side, as Figure 3.3 and Table 3.3 indicate, total&#13;
exports stagnated in 1979, with a slight decrease occurring in merchandise&#13;
exports.    At  the same   time,  the inflow of external     capital,  especially&#13;
commercial borrowing,   dried up.    As a result,    imports had to be reduced&#13;
substantially.   In dollar terms, imports of goods fell by 21 percent in 1978&#13;
and rose by only 10 percent in 1979 compared to 1977 levels.       The volume of&#13;
oil imports declined to 11.7 million tons in 1979 from 14.3 million tons in&#13;
1978.     Non-oil  imports,   which  consist   largely  of   capital  goods   and&#13;
intermediate inputs, fell sharply to 59 and 55 percent of the 1976 volume in&#13;

1978 and 1979, respectively.     The sharp curtailment of imports undoubtedly&#13;
contributed to low capacity utilization in industry and eventually to negative&#13;
growth in GDP in 1979. 1/&#13;
The Ecevit government fell in the fall of 1979 and a new government&#13;
was formed under Prime Minister Demiril. The Demiril government was replaced&#13;
following the military takeover in September 1980.    Early in 1980, during its&#13;
brief tenure, the Demiril government introduced further extensive measures to&#13;
address the deteriorating economic situation, and implemented the change in&#13;
focus of Turkey's development strategy from inward-looking import substitution&#13;
to export expansion that had been discussed since 1978.        The new strategy&#13;
involved opening up the economy by reducing the tariff and other barriers that&#13;
had promoted import substitution, and acting to reduce the existing bias&#13;
against  exporting.    The measures announced in January     1980 included   the&#13;
devaluation of the Turkish exchange rate from TL 47 to TL 70; duty-free entry&#13;
of imported inputs used in export production; simplification of the procedures&#13;
involved in obtaining export incentives and import licenses; and streamlining&#13;
of administrative regulations on investment incentives, with the reorientation&#13;
of investment priorities and the creation of special incentives for export-&#13;
oriented activities.    In addition, certain SEEs have been permitted greater&#13;
freedom in setting prices in an effort to improve their profitability and&#13;
reduce deficits. In summary, the new development strategy entails an opening&#13;
of the economy via export promotion policies and greater reliance on market&#13;
forces  and  less  on planning by decree.      Following  these steps,   several&#13;
additional measures were undertaken.   In July 1980, the rediscount rate of the&#13;
Central Bank on short-term notes was raised considerably and interest rate&#13;

ceilings on savings and loans were eliminated, allowing a rapid rise in&#13;
nominal rates and resulting in positive real interest rates. In January 1981,&#13;
the  income   tax  system  was   reformed,  import   controls  liberalized,   and&#13;
additional export incentives provided, which were supplemented further by&#13;
increases  in export   tax rebates   in May   1981.   Daily adjustments   in the&#13;
exchange rate were also introduced and, in July 1981, interest rates on bonds&#13;
were freed and their indexation introduced.&#13;
The January 1980 reforms had some immediate effects. The premium on&#13;
the lira in the parallel exchange market, which had averaged about 50 percent&#13;
in 1979, declined to between 2 and 3 percent.      The liberalization of price-&#13;
setting behavior reduced the deficit of the SEEs significantly, and reduced&#13;
public sector borrowing. Overall, however, the beneficial economic effects of&#13;
the reforms were limited by the unsettled domestic conditions and political&#13;
uncertainty that existed prior to the September 1980 military takeover.       The&#13;
disruptive effects of this turmoil are illustrated by the statistic that&#13;
increased strike activity in the first eight months of 1980 resulted in the&#13;
loss of 7.7 million workdays, compared to only 1.1 million workdays in all of&#13;
1979.   In the final months of 1980, economic recovery accelerated,       as the&#13;
dollar value of exports, stagnant in the early part of the year, reached&#13;
levels 63 percent above those for the same period in 1979. Exports continued&#13;
to rise rapidly throughout 1981.     Merchandise exports reached $4.7 billion,&#13;
with industrial exports rising by more than 100 percent.         The Middle East&#13;
became an increasingly important market not only for exports but also for&#13;
Turkish contractors, with around $9 billion in outstanding contracts by the&#13;
end of 1981.&#13;
Despite the positive developments in the last third of the year,&#13;
1980 was the second consecutive year of negative GDP growth.         Buffeted by&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

restrictive monetary policies and skyrocketing oil prices, domestic private&#13;
investment  in 1980 declined    in real terms.     The current account deficit&#13;
increased markedly despite the massive increase in net capital inflow, with&#13;
the $3.2 billion oil import bill larger than total commodity exports of $2.9&#13;
billion. Inflation surpassed 100 percent.&#13;
During 1981, the situation improved markedly.      Inflation came down&#13;
to an annual rate of around 35 percent.         Real imports of petroleum were&#13;
restricted to a lower level than that in 1980. Although the volume of non-oil&#13;
imports increased substantially in response to the economic recovery, the&#13;
aggregate dollar value of imports only increased by a moderate 13 percent.&#13;
Workers' remittances picked up significantly, encouraged by the measures taken&#13;
to protect their value. The flow of contractors' income from the Middle East&#13;
also contributed to a marked improvement in the current account deficit, which&#13;
declined by 35 percent to about $2.1 billion.     GDP increased by 4.2 percent,&#13;
the first positive growth since 1978. While all sectors recorded growth, the&#13;
7.3 percent expansion in manufacturing sector output was especially noteworthy&#13;
in that it indicated an upsurge in capacity utilization.&#13;
The external debt situation improved markedly in 1981 along with the&#13;
general improvement in economic performance. The debt service ratio declined&#13;
to  13.8 percent in 1981 from 17.0 percent       in 1980.    The improving debt&#13;
situation was also reflected in a decline in the share of short-term credits&#13;
in total debt from 49 percent in 1978 to 12 percent in 1981. While the series&#13;
of large debt reschedulings that were negotiated during the 1978-80 period&#13;
eased the short-run debt situation, the result is that debt service&#13;
obligations are likely to remain high throughout the mid 1980s as repayment of&#13;
rescheduled debt becomes necessary.&#13;
As a result of the economic developments that have been described&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
above,  the structure of the     Turkish economy changed significantly in the&#13;
1978-81 period.    In the following section, the structure of production and&#13;
expenditure in Turkey during the 1978-81 period is presented and contrasted&#13;
with the patterns for other middle income countries, using the data already&#13;
described above in Section B.    Table 3.4 illustrates the precipitous decline&#13;
in growth in nearly all sectors that occurred during the 1978-80 period.&#13;
As is shown in Table 3.5, the share of GDP in manufacturing&#13;
increased continuously throughout the period, while the share of agriculture&#13;
declined-11     The  remaining  sectoral   shares  remained  largely   unchanged.&#13;
Compared to the structural change in other MICs for the period prior to 1978&#13;
(Table 3.2), one finds that the agricultural share of 21.9 percent in Turkey&#13;
in 1981 is still higher than the sample average for other MICs of 19.8 percent&#13;
in  1977.    On  the other   hand,  the Turkish manufacturing    sector  in  1981&#13;
represented only 21.8 percent of GDP, which is smaller than the average&#13;
manufacturing share in the other MICs in 1977. It is interesting to note that&#13;
these 1981 sectoral shares for Turkey are very close to the sample average for&#13;
1970.&#13;
Table 3.5 also shows the expenditure structure of the Turkish&#13;
economy from 1978 through 1981.      The shares of exports and imports in GDP&#13;
increased dramatically in 1980, reflecting the reorientation of development&#13;
strategy from an inward orientation to one centered on export expansion.&#13;
Moreover, these shares increased further in 1981, reaching 10.2 and 16.5&#13;
percent.   Private consumption increased its share in GDP while the shares of&#13;
government consumption   and  private   fixed investment declined.    In spite of&#13;
-V The relative increase in the share of manufacturing in nominal GDP in the&#13;
1978-81 period (Table 3.5) in spite of its relatively slow real growth&#13;
rate (Table 3.4) is attributed to the change in relative prices in favor&#13;
of manufactured goods.&#13;

this substantial increase in export and import shares, in 1981 they were still&#13;
much lower than those recorded for the sample of MICs in 1977.      In fact, the&#13;
Turkish export share in 1981 was lower than the average share of MICs two&#13;
decades earlier in 1960, while the share of imports in GDP in Turkey in 1981&#13;
is very close to that for other MICs in 1970.           As a result of the 2.6&#13;
percentage point decline in the investment share between 1978 and 1981, the&#13;
Turkish investment share in GDP in 1981 fell to around the average share for&#13;
other MICs in 1960, which is much lower than their average in 1977.          This&#13;
decline in investment can be attributed primarily to the severe reduction in&#13;
private investment occurring as a response to the bleak economic outlook of&#13;
1979 and 1980.&#13;
D. Validation of the CGE Model, 1978-81&#13;
In this section, validation of the Turkey CGE model is considered by&#13;
means of a comparison of the model's estimates of important economic variables&#13;
with  their   actual  values  during   the  1978-81  period.    This   historical&#13;
validation is necessary to provide a check on the model's structural&#13;
specification and parameter values, so that the application of the model to&#13;
counterfactual historical experiments and forward projections can be&#13;
justified.    The  severe  political upheavals   and economic disequilibria in&#13;
Turkey during the 1978-81 period makes this validation difficult, requiring&#13;
the model to simulate a series of disequilibrium events when the model is best&#13;
suited to analyze smooth, medium to long-term equilibrium processes.&#13;
A validation exercise is conducted on several important endogenous&#13;
variables.   In order to make the validation procedure easier to visualize, a&#13;
list of the major exogenous variables used in the Historical Base Run is given&#13;
in Table 3.6, as well as the primary source for the data.       Variables marked&#13;
with asterisks are those that have been adjusted so that the model "validates"&#13;

Turkish economic performance for the 1978-81 period.       This process is best&#13;
viewed as one in which values of these unknown exogenous variables are&#13;
"estimated" in conjunction with the validation effort.      Among this group of&#13;
exogenous variables, sectoral import rationing rates and total factor&#13;
productivity growth rates were the most extensively used "instruments"&#13;
enabling the model to successfully track Turkish economic performance over the&#13;
1978-81 period.&#13;
The validation of the model focused on two groups of endogenous&#13;
variables:   nominal GDP by expenditure category and the growth rates of real&#13;
GDP by sector.     Before comparing the actual values with model estimates,&#13;
several problems encountered in obtaining a consistent data set should be&#13;
mentioned. In addition to official State Planning Organization (SPO) national&#13;
income data, Merih Celasun of Middle East Technical University in Ankara&#13;
provided the input-output table as well as many of the variables that are&#13;
sectorally differentiated.   Using two different data sources created numerous&#13;
problems,   including   the   reconciliation   of  two   incompatible   sectoral&#13;
aggregation schemes and decisions as to which set of numbers should be used in&#13;
cases where they diverged. The basic rule followed is that macroeconomic data&#13;
are taken from the official SPO statistics, while the sectoral structure is&#13;
taken from Celasun's data. 1/&#13;
The model was solved annually for the 1978-81 period, given the&#13;
specified  path  of  exogenous  variables.     Tables  3.7  and  3.8  present  a&#13;
comparison of model estimates with actual values for some GDP-related&#13;
statistics.   The actual values are taken from official SP0 statistics.      The&#13;
1978 solution for the CGE model exactly replicates the actual structure of the&#13;

economy by construction, while for subsequent years-the model structure is the&#13;
endogenous outcome of the model run, given the exogenous data and parameters.&#13;
Table 3.7 compares the model estimates and actual nominal GDP. The&#13;
model performs very well in tracking historical growth of nominal GDP, with&#13;
the largest model deviation only 1.4 percent in 1980. Table 3.8 presents the&#13;
production and demand structure obtained from official sources and from the&#13;
CGE model in 1978 and 1981. The model results reproduce the actual production&#13;
structure quite closely, although a tendency to underestimate the shares of&#13;
mining and services and overestimate the manufacturing share in both the&#13;
initial and terminal years is apparent.    Moreover, the model fails to capture&#13;
the significant decrease in the share of agriculture that occurred, and&#13;
predicts a decrease in the share of utilities when in fact it rose.         This&#13;
discrepancy is partly attributable to the difficulty in obtaining a consistent&#13;
sectoral aggregation, as was noted above.     The first part of Table 3.8 shows&#13;
that the structure of demand is estimated very well by our model.&#13;
In conclusion, in spite of the severe economic disequilibria that&#13;
characterized Turkey throughout the 1978-81 period, the CGE model does appear&#13;
to successfully track Turkish economic performance. Since models such as this&#13;
are primarily "structural" in their focus, the purpose of a validation&#13;

E. Analysis of CGE Model Results&#13;
As was noted above, the model validation also involved estimation of&#13;
certain unknown exogenous variables. These estimates in turn provide insights&#13;
into Turkey's economic performance during the period.       Tables 3.9 and 3.10&#13;
contain the estimated values for import quantity rationing rates and total&#13;
factor productivity change. When the growth rate of total productivity change&#13;
is less than unity, it probably represents increasing underutilization of&#13;
capacity, since its effect on production occurs via a change in the scale&#13;
parameter in the production function L/.     To effect the actual negative real&#13;
growth in mining and manufacturing production in 1979 and 1980, productivity&#13;
growth rates substantially less than 1.0 are implied, dramatically reducing&#13;

effective capacity utilization in these two sectors. 1!      This specification&#13;
reflects these sectors' actual economic performance during the period, when&#13;
production activity was depressed not only due to the shortage of foreign&#13;
exchange for the purchase of materials but also because of frequent strikes.&#13;
In addition to the relying on an endogenous import premium rate to&#13;
clear the foreign exchange market, quantity rationing of imports was&#13;
introduced into the model because the Turkish government used quotas&#13;
extensively to allocate foreign exchange for imports during the period of&#13;
foreign  exchange  shortage.2/  In  the CGE model,    sectorally differentiated&#13;
import quantity rationing rates are adjusted so that the model replicates&#13;
actual sectoral import figures.     Table 3.10 presents the quantity rationing&#13;
rates which were estimated for the Historical Base Run.        These values are&#13;
expressed as ratios of actual to desired imports, so that lower rationing&#13;
rates correspond to tighter quantity rationing.      Average quantity rationing&#13;
rates of around 70 percent are applied in both 1978 and 1979 as the foreign&#13;
exchange shortage was quite severe in these years.       This shortage eased in&#13;
1980 as the austere demand management policy pursued by the government reduced&#13;
import  demand   substantially.    Quantity   rationing  was  assumed   to  have&#13;
disappeared in all sectors in 1981, by which time the substantial increase in&#13;
export earnings and lother developments significantly alleviated the foreign&#13;
exchange shortage.3/&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Since quantity and premium rationing are alternative instruments to&#13;
reduce import demand, it is necessary to look at the combined effect of both&#13;
schemes in order to understand the full severity of the import rationing.&#13;
In Table 3.11, various aggregate measures of import rationing are shown. The&#13;
premium rate, which was assumed to be zero in 1978, stayed high at around 33&#13;
percent in 1979 and 1980, before declining to 4 percent in 1981. .1/          The&#13;
average quantity rationing rate was nearly constant in 1978 and 1979, but in&#13;
1980 the reliance on quantity rationing was much less.         The best overall&#13;
indicator of rationing severity is the import rents/total value added figure&#13;
in which the potential and actual rents arising from both rationing schemes&#13;
are shown as shares of total value added. As is evident, the foreign exchange&#13;
situation was most serious in 1979 when tight quantity rationing and a high&#13;
premium rate caused the share of import rents to reach 16.5 percent. By 1981,&#13;
the foreign exchange situation had improved substantially so that this ratio&#13;
was less than one percent.&#13;
The terms of trade for agricultural goods measured against all other&#13;
commodities deteriorated significantly in 1979 and 1980 before improving&#13;
dramatically in 1981. This development can probably be attributed to the fact&#13;
that agricultural growth suffered relatively less than other sectors during&#13;
the 1979-80 disruptions, with the result that agricultural prices rose more&#13;
slowly than scarcer industrial commodities with high import components.&#13;
F. Sources Decomposition of Output Growth&#13;
In this section, sectoral output growth is decomposed into the&#13;
contributions of demand components for the 1978-81 period, and the results&#13;
.1.  The assumption of a premium rate of zero in 1978 provides a benchmark&#13;
value for the endogenously determined premium rate in subsequent years.&#13;
Any positive value could be specified for the 1978 premium rate, but it&#13;
would merely raise premium rates in later years by a corresponding amount.&#13;

compared with those from earlier periods.        Using the total decomposition&#13;
measure, the demand components considered here are: changes in domestic final&#13;
demand, export demand, import demand through import substitution, and&#13;
intermediate demand through changes in input-output coefficients L/         Table&#13;
3.12 presents output growth rates and percentage contributions of these four&#13;
demand factors to output changes in the primary, manufacturing and services&#13;
sectors for five periods between 1958 and 1981.2/&#13;
The 1978-81 period reveals very different estimates of sectoral&#13;
growth rates and the contributions of the various demand components to sources&#13;
of growth. Specifically, these are:&#13;
(1) From 1958 to 1973, output growth rates were always highest in&#13;
the manufacturing sector, followed by the service and primary sectors.&#13;
However, the relative ranking of these growth rates by sectors was reversed in&#13;
the 1978-81 period. The manufacturing sector in the last period even recorded&#13;
a negative annual output growth rate of -2.9 percent, reflecting the severe&#13;
economic crisis.&#13;
(2) The relative contribution to output change of domestic demand&#13;
expansion was much smaller in the 1978-81 period than in other periods in all&#13;
three sectors, while the contribution from export demand expansion as well as&#13;
the negative contribution from negative import substitution increased&#13;
1/ For a detailed description of the methodology, see Kubo and Robinson&#13;
(1979). The use of the total decomposition measure means that the&#13;
contribution of, for example, export expansion to the output growth of a&#13;
certain sector includes not only the effect due to that sector's export&#13;
growth (direct) but also that due to export growth in all other sectors&#13;
(indirect) as well.&#13;
2/ The estimates for the three periods between 1958 and 1973 are taken from&#13;
the Sources of Growth project undertaken at the World Bank, while the&#13;
Dervis and Robinson (1978) study provided the estimates for the 1973-77&#13;
period. In their study, sources of growth are attributed to three factors&#13;
only since input-output coefficients were assumed fixed during the period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
substantially.   This phenomenon is especially noticeable in the manufacturing&#13;
sector, where the absolute value of the percentage contribution by domestic&#13;
demand expansion was surpassed by the contributions of both export expansion&#13;
and import substitution.    This significant reversal can be attributed to two&#13;
effects:   first, the depressed level of domestic demand occurring under the&#13;
tight demand management policy; and second, the movement away from an inward-&#13;
oriented policy which began in 1980.&#13;
(3) The magnitude of the contribution from changes in input-output&#13;
coefficients is very small in the 1978-81 period. Since an input-output table&#13;
for 1981 was not available, only the input-output coefficients representing&#13;
petroleum and coal inputs were updated for selected sectors, since these&#13;
inputs experienced such drastic relative price changes during the period 1/&#13;
The change in coefficients portrayed in the 1978-81 period occurred as the&#13;
price of oil increased rapidly in relation to the price of coal, which&#13;
resulted in the substitution of coal (higher coefficients) for oil (lower) in&#13;
production 2/  This substitution is reflected as a positive contribution from&#13;
changes in input-output coefficients in the primary sector and as a negative&#13;
contribution in the manufacturing sector since coal and oil are classified in&#13;
the primary and manufacturing sectors respectively.&#13;
Although the 1978-81 results deviate from the sources of growth for&#13;
earlier periods, an interesting pattern emerges regarding the contribution of&#13;
import substitution.    The sign of the contribution to output growth from&#13;
import substitution alternates each period, implying discontinuities in the&#13;
import policies pursued by the Turkish government.      A negative sign for the&#13;
1/ For a more detailed description of this procedure, see Appendix I.&#13;
2/ The nominal price of oil increased almost twelve times whereas the coal&#13;
price increased seven times between 1978 and 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
import substitution contribution corresponds to a period characterized by&#13;
liberal import policies, whereas a positive sign corresponds to a period with&#13;
a restrictive import policy.      The Turkish import policy has largely been&#13;
determined by the relative scarcity of foreign exchange.       Judging from the&#13;
growth experience of other countries, such discontinuity in import policy is&#13;
probably harmful to economic development.     In the most successful countries,&#13;
such as Japan and Korea, an import substitution period was followed by a long&#13;
period of sustained import liberalization during which quantitative and tariff&#13;
import restrictions were reduced.1/     Such import liberalization facilitated&#13;
export expansion by removing the incentive bias against exports that arises&#13;
from protectionist import substitution, and by enabling producers to use&#13;
materials and capital goods efficientlyw2/&#13;
G. Analysis of the Foreign Exchange Crisis: Counterfactual Simulations&#13;
In this section, an analysis of factors contributing to the 1979&#13;
foreign exchange crisis and its aftermath is undertaken by examining the&#13;
"equilibrium" exchange rate that results from three different counterfactual&#13;
experiments.   Unlike the Historical Base Run, in which simultaneous premium&#13;
and quantity rationing of imports were the mechanisms used to clear the&#13;
foreign exchange market, in the counterfactual experiments below the exchange&#13;
rate  adjusts  freely   to  clear  the  foreign  exchange  market.    For  these&#13;
experiments, distortions in the foreign exchange market such as import&#13;
rationing have been eliminated; however, distortions in other areas of the&#13;
economy such as taxes and subsidies in the product and factor markets still&#13;
remain.   Therefore, the "equilibrium" exchange rate that is obtained in the&#13;
.11 See Kubo and Robinson (1979), Table 2, p. 10 and 17.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
experiments is a "market clearing" rate, and does not represent an "optimal"&#13;
or "shadow" exchange rate.&#13;
The first experiment (Experiment 1) solves for the "equilibrium"&#13;
exchange rate for the 1978-81 period, retaining all the assumptions and data&#13;
in the historical run except for the clearing of the foreign exchange&#13;
market. The sequence of "equilibrium" exchange rates obtained from this first&#13;
experiment will be used as a basis for a comparison with the results from the&#13;
other experiments.   The second experiment (Experiment 2) analyzes the effect&#13;
of the sharp increase in oil prices that occurred in the 1978-81 period.L/&#13;
Figure 3.4 shows the substantial increase in world oil prices compared to&#13;
other industrial commodity prices in the period.        From the 1978 benchmark&#13;
values of 100, the oil price increased -to 267 by 1980 while the prices of&#13;
other commodities increased only to 128.    In growth terms, the oil price went&#13;
up by 49.6 and 78.4 percent in 1979 and 1980 whereas the price index of other&#13;
commodities increased only by 14.5 and 11.7 percent in the same years.         In&#13;
1981, the oil price increase slowed to only 6.0 percent annually, while the&#13;
prices  of   other  commodities   actually   declined  by   4.5  percent.     The&#13;
third experiment (Experiment 3) examines the effect of the inflation&#13;
differential between Turkey and its trading partners.2/      Figure 3.5 portrays&#13;
the trends in inflation rates in Turkey and its trading partners in the 1978-&#13;
81 period.   The price level in Turkey quintupled during the period, while the&#13;
price  level  in Turkey's trading partners increased by 50 percent.      Although&#13;
/  Throughout   the  following  discussion,   "oil"  should  be  understood   to&#13;
represent the full range of traded petroleum commodities, including crude&#13;
oil and petroleum products.&#13;
2/ The effects of lower investment and higher remittances analyzed by Dervis&#13;
and Robinson are not examined here because these factors do not seem to&#13;
have contributed to the depreciation of the exchange rate in this period.&#13;

annual inflation was higher in Turkey in all years, the inflation differential&#13;
was the largest in 1980 when Turkey experienced a 110 percent inflation rate&#13;
compared to only 28 percent in its trading partners.&#13;
The features of the three experiments are summarized below:&#13;
Experiment                      Features&#13;
Exp. 1:        Same as Historical Base Run, but with flexible exchange&#13;
rate and no import rationing&#13;
Exp. 2:        Same  as  Experiment 1,   but  with  no  increase in the&#13;
relative price of oil petroleum&#13;
Exp. 3:        Same  as  Experiment 2, but with no inflation differen-&#13;
tial between Turkey and its trading partners&#13;
The "equilibrium" exchange rates from the experiments are shown in&#13;
Table 3.13 in addition to the actual exchange rates observed in the 1978-81&#13;
period. Experiment 1 indicates that if there had been no import rationing in&#13;
the foreign exchange market the exchange rate would have been 38.3 TL/IIS $ in&#13;
1978, and by 1981 the exchange rate would have depreciated to 112.6 TL/US $.&#13;
Comparing the exchange rate obtained from Experiment 1 with the actual&#13;
exchange rate, one finds that the exchange rate would have depreciated more if&#13;
the flexible exchange rate system had been relied on to achieve balance.       To&#13;
put it differently, the Turkish lira was overvalued during the 1978-81&#13;
period. This finding is consistent with the positive premium rate observed in&#13;
the Historical Base Run.   Experiments 2 and 3 examine the contribution of the&#13;
oil price increase and inflation differential to the depreciation of the&#13;
Turkish lira obtained in Experiment 1.       In Experiment 2 the exchange rate&#13;
would have been lower if there were no oil price increase throughout the&#13;
period. This is especially evident in 1980 and 1981, where the exchange rate&#13;
would have been almost 50 percent lower.        Experiment 3 shows that in the&#13;

- 40 -&#13;
absence of the oil price increase and higher domestic inflation the exchange&#13;
rate would actually have appreciated in 1980 and 1981 from its 1978 level.&#13;
This appreciation is due largely to the major increase in net foreign capital&#13;
inflow in the latter two years (see Table 3.3).&#13;

Using the results in Table 3.13, one can compute the percentage&#13;
contribution of the oil price increase, differential inflation, and other&#13;
residual factors to the depreciation of the Turkish lira observed in&#13;
Experiment 1. 1/ The results, which are shown in Table 3.14, suggest that the&#13;
.1/ See Dervis and Robinson (1978), pp. 54-56 for a full discussion of the&#13;
method employed. Summarizing, the exchange rate decomposition uses the&#13;
relationship&#13;
ER79     E2   x  E3  x  RES  x  ER78&#13;
where ER78 and ER79 represent "equilibrium" exchange rates from Experiment&#13;
1 for 1978 and 1979, and E2, E3, and RES are the depreciations due to&#13;
Experiments 2, 3 and residual factors, respectively. Percentage&#13;
contributions of the three factors are obtained by taking logarithms of&#13;
both sides of the above equation and dividing each factor share by the&#13;
change in the exchange rate, e.g. for Experiment 2, the percentage&#13;
contribution is found by&#13;
log E2&#13;
(log ER79 - log ER78)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
inflation differential was more important than the oil price rise in&#13;
contributing to the depreciation of lira throughout the period, although the&#13;
contribution of the oil price increase was itself substantial.      Between 1978&#13;
and 1979, the contributions of the oil price increase and inflation&#13;
differential to the depreciation are 29.5 and 62.1 percent, thus leaving only&#13;
8.4 percent of the depreciation to be explained by other factors. In both the&#13;
1978-80 and 1978-81 periods, the contributions from these two factors are&#13;
still important, but the increase in foreign capital inflow is also very&#13;
significant, leading to a large negative contribution of "residual factors."&#13;
Paralleling the findings of Dervis and Robinson on the causes of the&#13;
1973-77 foreign exchange crisis, we find that the inflation differential&#13;
played the most significant role in the depreciation of the exchange rate in&#13;
the 1978-81 period.   However, the magnitude of the inflation differential and&#13;
oil price increase contributions appears far greater in the 1978-81 period&#13;
than during 1973-77.&#13;

These   findings   suggest  the   importance  of   domestic   economic&#13;
management, since it appears that the depreciation of the equilibrium exchange&#13;
rate can be attributed mainly to the runaway domestic inflation of the&#13;
period.   In fact, favorable external factors such as increased capital inflow&#13;
and export expansion were large enough to offset the unfavorable external&#13;
effect of the oil price increase in the 1978-81 period (61.6 percent vs. 53.8&#13;
percent).   If Turkey had experienced an inflation rate comparable to that of&#13;
its trading partners, the Turkish lira would have appreciated in 1981 compared&#13;
to the 1978 level, given the turnaround in net foreign capital inflows.&#13;
Although the oil price increase and differential inflation factors&#13;
were pronounced in both 1979 land 1980, the latter year did differ in other&#13;
ways. Exports grew in dollar terms by 25.9 percent in 1980, foreshadowing the&#13;
phenomenal 56.4 percent subsequent increase in 1981.     Although the depressed&#13;
level of domestic demand undoubtedly facilitated the export expansion, another&#13;
important factor was the response of the Turkish economy to the reorientation&#13;
of development strategy from inward-looking to outward-looking, as signalled&#13;
by the wide-ranging foreign exchange reforms adopted early in 1980.&#13;
Accompanying   this  shift   in  development   policies   and  improved   export&#13;
performance was an increase in foreign capital inflow, which, regardless of&#13;
the political motivations of the lenders, was partially in response to the&#13;
improved economic prospects implicit in the export surge.&#13;
Considering the extent to which the shift in development strategy&#13;
has enabled Turkey to extricate itself from the 1979-80 crisis, it is of&#13;
interest to examine the "cost" to the Turkish economy of failing to adopt the&#13;
open, export-oriented strategy before the foreign exchange shortage had so&#13;
dramatically  crippled  the  economy.     Let  us  examine,  as  an alternative&#13;
hypothesis, a Scenario in whicn the shift in development orientation was made&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

in 1979 rather than 1980.&#13;
The effects of such a policy change can be analyzed by the following&#13;
simulation experiment.   In this experiment (Experiment 4), aggregate exports,&#13;
capital inflows and reserve changes are assumed to follow smooth trends&#13;
instead of the large fluctuations observed in the 1978-81 period.       For each&#13;
aggregate, the cumulative value over the period in the experiment is set equal&#13;
to the historical value.   The annual figures used for this experiment as well&#13;
as those actually observed are shown in Table 3.15.     In addition to assuming&#13;
these hypothetical values for foreign exchange components, an outward-looking&#13;
policy should incorporate an elimination of rationing distortions in the&#13;
foreign  exchange  market.     Therefore,  this  counterfactual   experiment  is&#13;
performed with a flexible exchange rate.       It should be noted that actual&#13;
domestic inflation rates and oil price increases are retained, so Experiment 4&#13;
resembles Experiment 1 except for the smoothing of balance of payment trends.&#13;

In estimating the effect of delayed adjustment, cumulative real GDP&#13;
over the 1978-81 period provides a useful indicator.        Cumulative real GDP&#13;
obtained from the Historical Base Run and from Experiment 4 is 5125 billion&#13;
and 5275 billion lira in 1978 prices, respectively, indicating an estimate of&#13;
150 billion liras as the cost of postponing the adjustment by one year. This&#13;
cost amounts to nearly 3 percent of cumulative real GDP; the annual average&#13;
cost of 37.5 billion is almost 50 percent of total exports in 1978,&#13;
underscoring the potential significance of the improvement from an earlier&#13;
policy shift.&#13;
This experiment analyzed only the effect of adjustment in trade&#13;
policies, while retaining the same sequence of domestic inflation, oil price&#13;
increases, and negative productivity growth of the Historical Base Run.&#13;
However, if domestic policies such as demand management were also considered,&#13;
the penalty implicit in failure to adopt appropriate policies sooner would&#13;
have been substantially higher.&#13;

4. Analysis of Turkish Medium-Term Prospects, 1982-90&#13;
This section describes the use of the CGE model to analyze the&#13;
medium-term prospects of the Turkish economy over the coming decade (1982-&#13;
90). Based on the continuing rapid growth of Turkish exports throughout 1981&#13;
and 1982, the Turkish economy has emerged from the shadow of the recent&#13;
foreign exchange crisis and now faces a more favorable economic outlook. This&#13;
section addresses the question of what are the economic conditions and policy&#13;
choices necessary to permit the Turkish economy to return to a GDP growth rate&#13;
of six percent or higher. First, a Forward Base Run is developed based on the&#13;
assumption that the government adopts trade and domestic policies that permit&#13;
the current export-driven growth to continue, and that encourage a recovery ini&#13;
domestic demand and an increase in private investment.        Next, alternative&#13;
forward scenarios are examined by varying certain key characteristics of the&#13;
Forward Base Run.    Four different factors and their implications for growth&#13;
prospects are examined in these alternative runs: first, the role of export&#13;
growth; second, the importance of productivity growth; third, the critical&#13;
influence of government trade and exchange rate policy on exports; and fourth,&#13;
the need for domestic demand recovery and especially a dramatic increase in&#13;
private investment. Finally, the viability of the base scenario is considered&#13;
by comparing the projected Turkish path with the experience of other economies&#13;
pursuing export-led strategies.&#13;
&#13;

A. The Medium-Term Outlook: Basic Assumptions&#13;
In   projecting   the   consequences   of   alternative    development&#13;
strategies, it is important to remember that all model results are conditional&#13;
on the specific policy packages and projections of exogenous variables that&#13;
are being used.   The selection of one scenario as "better" than another must&#13;
occur with full awareness that the policy environment underlying the scenario&#13;
must be pursued by the government.&#13;
With any forward-looking planning model, the results depend upon the&#13;
choice of time paths for the various exogenous variables that drive the&#13;
model.    For certain variables, such as the growth of the labor force by&#13;
category, the projections represent an extrapolation of historical trends.&#13;
For trends in international economic variables, such as world prices of&#13;
exports and imports, the data come from the World Bank's own projections.     It&#13;
is also necessary to make certain assumptions about domestic inflation rates,&#13;
which, given the model's focus on real growth, are essentially neutral in&#13;
their effect on real variables.      For the runs presented here, it has been&#13;
assumed that Turkish inflation, forecast at 35 percent for 1982, is brought&#13;
under control by 1985, so that in the second half of the 1980's, Turkish&#13;
inflation is only moderately higher than world inflation (15 percent vs. 7&#13;
percent).   In all forward scenarios except one, it is also assumed that the&#13;
exchange rate is adjusted so that a constant, price-level deflated exchange&#13;
rate is maintained throughout the 1982-90 period; in other words, the nominal&#13;
exchange rate is adjusted by an amount determined by the differential between&#13;
Turkish domestic inflation and world inflation. These various assumptions are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.1.&#13;

The agricultural price figures in Table 4.1 have been obtained by&#13;
using the World Bank's projections for agricultural commodities, and are cited&#13;
separately here since they indicate that world price conditions are especially&#13;
favorable in the early 1980's for the group of cash crops that have&#13;
traditionally dominated Turkish agricultural exports.       The petroleum import&#13;
prices are also taken from current World Bank forecasts.&#13;
A number of variables and policies that are exogenous to the model&#13;
have been chosen to reflect plausible government policy regimes and macro-&#13;
economic performance. On the trade side, in keeping with the proposals of the&#13;
Balassa Mission, it is assumed that all sectoral tariff rates are reduced by&#13;
five percent per year throughout the period, leading to a 40 percent reduction&#13;
in all tariff    rates by   1990...   It is also assumed     that the rebate to&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
exporters of tariffs paid on intermediate goods and production taxes paid on&#13;
goods destined for export continues, so that the sectoral export subsidy is&#13;
determined endogenously by the model for each sector based on the proportion&#13;
of output exported, and the magnitude of tariffs and taxes paid.&#13;
On the macroeconomic side, to assure comparability in investment&#13;
behavior among runs, the savings-investment balance in the CGE model is&#13;
investment-determined, so that the share of fixed investment in nominal GDP&#13;
has been set to exogenously specified values. The government's share of fixed&#13;
investment is controlled by varying its investment rate out of current&#13;
revenue, with private enterprise savings rates adjusting to guarantee that&#13;
sufficient aggregate savings is generated.     The allocation of public sector&#13;
investment occurs using exogenously specified shares reflecting the priorities&#13;
of the Public Sector Investment Program; private investment is allocated among&#13;
agriculture, industry, and services according to exogenous shares, which&#13;
specify that the manufacturing share of private investment will rise from 25&#13;
to 40 percent by 1990. Within the manufacturing sector, investment allocation&#13;
is responsive to deviations in rental rates from the average, so that more&#13;
profitable sectors will receive an increasing proportion of the manufacturing&#13;
investment over time.&#13;
Finally, it should be noted that in most experiments, sectoral&#13;
export growth is imposed exogenously on the model by specifying annual growth&#13;
rates of exports in dollar terms.    Since growth rates in world ($) prices of&#13;
exports are also specified exogenously, these two trends determine real export&#13;
growth in the projection period. While this portrayal permits examination of&#13;
the impact of various export growth scenarios, it is important to understand&#13;
that it represents strong implicit assumptions about shifts in world demand&#13;
conditions for Turkish exports and the ability of Turkish exporters to&#13;
respond.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

B. The Base Run: Successful Export Expansion&#13;
Tables 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 illustrate the key features of the Base&#13;
Run.    The dominant characteristic    is that the export expansion drive is&#13;
sustained throughout the coming decade, so that following the 27.2 percent&#13;
growth in real exports projected for 1982, export growth stabilizes at around&#13;
10 percent per annum for the 1984-90 period.'/        As Table 4.2 shows, this&#13;
implies total nominal exports in 1982 of $8.05 billion (of which $6.1 billion&#13;
is merchandise exports), rising to $31.78 billion by 1990, corresponding to an&#13;
average growth rate of 18.7 percent for the period.      Figure 4.1 portrays the&#13;
composition of exports forecast for the coming decade. Textiles and processed&#13;
food are projected to rise from 35 percent of total exports in 1981 to over 45&#13;
percent in 1990, while other industry exports grow from around 15 percent to&#13;
almost 25 percent of the total between 1981 and 1990.       Agricultural exports&#13;
suffer the biggest decline, as their share drops below 20 percent by the end&#13;
of the period.&#13;
Corresponding to this growth in exports, real imports are projected&#13;
to grow 5.8 percent during 1982, 7.9 percent annually during 1982-86, and 9.5&#13;
percent during 1986-90.    In dollar terms, this implies an increase in total&#13;
imports from $10.60 billion in 1982 to $35.82 billion in 1990, representing an&#13;
average growth rate of 16.4 percent.        Figure 4.2 shows the structure of&#13;
imports generated in the Base Run for 1982-90.     Especially noteworthy in this&#13;
figure is the remarkable shift in the composition of imports that occurred&#13;
from 1978 to 1981, during which time the imports of non-petroleum industrial&#13;
commodities declined from 62 to 47 percent of the total, while petroleum&#13;

imports climbed from 28 to nearly 45 percent by 1981.         The 1982-90 period&#13;
projections show a gradual return of these two import groups towards their&#13;
pre-crisis proportions, with petroleum declining to around 35 percent of the&#13;
total by 1990.&#13;
Throughout the 1982-90 period, it is assumed for the Base Run that&#13;
the government pursues exchange rate management policies that adjust the&#13;
exchange rate to offset fully the differences between Turkish and world&#13;
inflation rates (i.e., the price-level deflated or real exchange rate remains&#13;
constant).   The other components of the balance of payments (remittances,&#13;
factor services income, net capital inflow, and reserve changes) represent&#13;
current estimates of likely time paths for these quantities.          Figure 4.3&#13;
summarizes the major features of the balance of payments projections over the&#13;
1982-90 period, using trade flows in dollar terms converted at the projected&#13;
exchange rate and expressed as percentages of nominal GDP.      The rapid export&#13;
growth of the 1980-82 period is evident, as is the more moderated sustained&#13;
expansion forecast for the 1984-90 period.        The trade deficit   (or import&#13;
surplus) declines from a high of almost 8 percent of GDP in 1980 to less than&#13;
3 percent in 1990; similarly, the current account deficit (see Table 4.2)&#13;
declines to under 1 percent of GDP for the entire 1984-90 period.&#13;
As Table 4.3 illustrates, this export growth implies an increase in&#13;
the share of nominal exports in GDP from 11.0 percent in 1981 to 19.9 percent&#13;
in 1990 (18.8 percent in real terms) thereby permitting the import share to&#13;
rise from 16.8 percent to 23.9 percent over the same period (21.2 percent&#13;
real).&#13;

In line with the Turkish government's policy of encouraging an&#13;
increasing role for the private sector in the investment process, the&#13;
government's share of total investment is modelled as falling from over 60&#13;
percent  in  1982  to only 42 percent    in 1990, as Figure 4.4 shows.        The&#13;
investment/GDP ratio, on the other hand, is forecast to increase from a low of&#13;
22.9 percent in 1982 to 26.8 percent in 1990.      The combination of these two&#13;
trends means that the Base Run has as an implicit assumption an increase in&#13;
the private investment/GDP ratio from 9.1 percent in 1982 to 15.4 percent in&#13;
1990.&#13;
Table 4.4 contains the value added and GDP projections for selected&#13;
years in the Base Run.    Value added in agriculture is assumed to grow at an&#13;
annual rate of around 3.0 percent throughout the 1982-90 period; the growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
rates in industry and services are endogenously determined by the model. GDP&#13;
growth is projected to accelerate during the period, reaching 6.1 percent per&#13;
annum over the 1986-90 period.&#13;
Overall, the Base Run portrays a period of accelerating economic&#13;
growth for Turkey, led by the sustained expansion of exports, an increased&#13;
role for private investment, and private consumption growth that will permit a&#13;
significant improvement in living standards.&#13;
C. Alternative Medium-Term Scenarios&#13;
The following discussion focuses on four different experiments which&#13;
differ from the Base Run in their assumptions about export growth, foreign&#13;
capital inflows, productivity growth, investment response, and exchange rate&#13;
policy over the next decade.    Each of these alternative runs is described in&#13;
turn below by contrasting it with the features of the Base Run just presented.&#13;
Table 4.5 presents the balance of payments trends for each of the runs that is&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
Experiment C-1: Export Growth - Productivity Link&#13;
This run retains all the assumptions and exogenous trends of the&#13;
Base Run, and in addition hypothesizes a positive link between sustained&#13;
export expansion and productivity growth. As suggested by Balassa and others,&#13;
this link is related to the production efficiency gains that result from&#13;
sustained  exposure   to  competition  in  world  export  markets.     For  this&#13;
experiment, it is assumed that total factor productivity growth rates in the&#13;
manufacturing sectors are 50 percent higher than in the Base Run; this&#13;
corresponds to an increase from 2.2 to 3.3 percent per year 1/&#13;
l/ The 2.2 percent figure is based on econometric estimates reported for&#13;
Turkey in Krueger and Tuncer (1980).     The 3.3 percent figure assumed in&#13;
this run is still well below the 4.0-4.5 percent rates achieved by&#13;
countries such as Korea and Japan during their export-led growth periods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Experiment C-2: Downside Risk&#13;
This experiment explores the combined impact on Turkish medium-term&#13;
prospects of variations in a number of assumptions made in the Base Run.&#13;
Merchandise exports in the 1982 are assumed to reach only $5.85 billion,&#13;
instead of the $6.1 billion total in the Base Run. More important, the growth&#13;
rate of real exports is assumed to drop to 8.5 percent in 1984-86 and&#13;
stabilize at 7.9 percent during 1986-90, as constrasted with 10.2 and 10.1&#13;
percent  for the same    periods  in the Base Run.      The net   capital inflow&#13;
components have been changed to reflect the increased borrowing needs stemming&#13;
from reduced export earnings.&#13;
In addition, the world price of oil is projected to rise even more&#13;
rapidly than in the Base Run, as the data shown in Table 4.1 show. Instead of&#13;
petroleum import prices rising at a 9 percent annual rate for 1984-90 (or&#13;
around 2 percentage points higher than average import prices) as in the Base&#13;
Run, this experiment specifies that they rise at 10 percent rate for 1984-86&#13;
and 11 percent for 1986-90.&#13;
Finally,   on  the   fiscal  side,   this  experiment   simulates  the&#13;
possibility that the government is less successful in reducing its share of&#13;
total investment, so that the share of public investment in the total declines&#13;
from 60 percent in 1982 to 50 percent in 1990, instead of the 42 percent share&#13;
achieved in the Base Run&#13;
Experiment C-3: Lower Agricultural Growth and Lower Investment Rate&#13;
Experiment C-3 retains the lower export scenario of Experiment C-2,&#13;
as well as the smaller reduction in the share of public investment.            In&#13;
addition, it specifies that the Turkish agricultural sector, which in the Base&#13;
Run is assumed to reach a 3.1 percent growth rate in value added over the&#13;
1982-90 period, instead achieves a more moderate 2.5 percent growth rate over&#13;
the same period.&#13;

Finally, this experiment models the impact of a more restrained&#13;
private investment response than that built into the Base Run by specifying&#13;
that the gross investment/GDP ratio levels off at around 25 percent for the&#13;
1984-90 period, rather than the 27 percent share reached in the Base Run.&#13;
Experiment C-4: Real Exchange Rate Appreciation&#13;
In this final experiment, the Base Run assumptions are used as a&#13;
starting point to examine the potential effects of slippage occuring in the&#13;
exchange rate policy used in the Base Run.     Specifically, it is assumed that&#13;
during the 1984-90 period, the exchange rate is not permitted to adjust to&#13;
offset fully the world and domestic inflation differential; instead of the&#13;
constant real exchange rate of the Base Run, the real exchange rate in this&#13;
run appreciates at an average rate of 2 percent per year during 1984-90.&#13;
The main mechanism through which this appreciation affects the&#13;
economy is through a decline in exports and export earnings.         To simulate&#13;
this, the sectoral export levels achieved in the Base Run are viewed as&#13;
representing an equilibrium in export markets, with perfectly elastic world&#13;
demand functions for Turkish exports at the given world price and upward-&#13;
sloping  (logistic)  export  supply  functions  for Turkish exporters.      These&#13;
export supply functions describe the response of exporters to differentials&#13;
between world and domestic prices of exported goods and shift exogenously over&#13;
time to represent changing supply or demand conditions.        The exchange rate&#13;
appreciation reduces the domestic currency price of exports that exporters&#13;
respond to, thereby resulting in lower exports.     There is a strong cumulative&#13;
impact on export supply, as lower exports in one period imply that similar&#13;
exogenous shifts in the supply curves will result in a lower export level the&#13;
next period, even without further exchange rate changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. Macroeconomic Projections&#13;
The consequences of each of the alternative forward runs for a range&#13;
of macroeconomic aggregates is portrayed in Tables 4.6 and 4.7. Note that the&#13;
5.6 percent GDP growth rate for the Base Run illustrates that a successful&#13;
export expansion strategy will permit a return to growth rates comparable to&#13;
earlier periods of growth in Turkey.    This average rate for the whole period&#13;
encompasses a steady increase from 4.8 percent in 1981-82 to over 6.2 percent&#13;
in 1986-90, reflecting the cumulative effect of export growth rates substan-&#13;
tially  higher  than GDP growth,    and a rising    investment/GDP  share.    In&#13;
Experiments C-2 and C-3, it can be seen that the immediate effect of lowering&#13;
the 1981-90 growth rate of real exports to 10.4 percent is to lower GDP growth&#13;
to 5.4 percent in Experiment C-2 and 5.3 percent in Experiment C-3, with the&#13;
GDP growth rate failing to accelerate as it did in the Base Run, reaching only&#13;
5.6 - 5.7 percent over the final four years.&#13;
Second, the alternative scenarios have very different impacts on the&#13;
growth in private real fixed investment.    In the Base Run and Experiments C-1&#13;
and C-4, where the investment/GDP ratio is projected to rise to nearly 27&#13;
percent by 1990, the growth in private investment is greater than 11 percent&#13;
over the whole 1981-90 period, or nearly twice the rate of GDP growth.&#13;
However, in Experiments C-2 and C-3, where the share of public investment in&#13;
the total remains at around 50 percent through the latter half of the period,&#13;
rather than dropping to 42 percent, the differential between private and&#13;
public fixed investment growth is reduced, with private fixed investment&#13;
growing only around    9 percent   yearly.    The rapid growth of real     fixed&#13;
investment in the Base Run and Experiment C-1, with high export growth,&#13;
illustrates an important and often overlooked benefit of an export-led&#13;
strategy - with exports growing rapidly, the extent of import rationing&#13;

necessary to achieve foreign balance is quite low, and the supply of imports&#13;
remains quite high at a lower domestic price than under a regime of foreign&#13;
exchange constraints.   With imported capital goods an important component of&#13;
new investment, one result of this lower import price is to permit more real&#13;
investment from a given nominal investment expenditure to occur compared to&#13;
the case where capital goods imports are restricted and expensive.&#13;
On the value added side, it is clear that the higher export&#13;
alternatives (the Base Run and Experiment C-1) allow for the most rapid growth&#13;
in manufacturing output.     Value added in the mining sectors grows rapidly,&#13;
given its relatively small base and the increased investment in domestic&#13;

lignite production in an effort to reduce petroleum imports.      Finally, the&#13;
service sector appears to maintain its share of total value added, as&#13;
evidenced by the growth rates quite close to the overall GDP growth rate in&#13;
every experiment.&#13;
IJsing the data in Table 4.7, certain additional features of the&#13;
alternative scenarios become clear.    The share of exports in GDP, which is&#13;
only 11.0 percent in 1981, rises to over 19-20 percent in the two high export&#13;
growth runs (the Base Run and Experiment C-1), while it reaches only around 17&#13;
percent in the more pessimistic scenarios.   The increase in.import/GDP shares&#13;
is less substantial, although in even the most pessimistic scenarios the ratio&#13;
does rise from the 1981 value of 16.8 percent.   Another way of observing this&#13;
effect is from the import elasticities in Table 4.6. In the high export runs,&#13;
the import elasticities with respect to GDP range between 1.42 and 1.49, while&#13;
for the less optimistic alternatives, they drop as low as 1.24 for the low&#13;
export, high petroleum price alternative (Experiment C-2). This reflects the&#13;
difference between the nearly unconstrained import growth permitted as a&#13;
result of high export growth, versus the economizing of import use required as&#13;
a result of foreign exchange constraints.   The import elasticities, which are&#13;
greater than 1.0 in all cases, reflect the turning away from import&#13;
substitution as a goal of industrialization. However, the lesson that emerges&#13;
is that import elasticities of 1.4 or higher are quite acceptable when the&#13;
corresponding export elasticity is over 2.0.&#13;
One interesting aspect of the investment-consumption tradeoff is&#13;
evident in the investment/GDP and foreign savings/total savings ratios in&#13;
Table 4.7.    In the Base Run and Experiments C-1, C-2 and C-4, the fixed&#13;
investment/GDP ratio in 1940 is fixed at 24 percent.     However, the share of&#13;
private consumption in GDP in the terminal year varies substantially among&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
these  four  runs.    One  explanation  for this variance    is evident   in the&#13;
foreign/total savings shares in the table.    When this proportion remains over&#13;
20 percent, as occurs in Experiment C-2, the share of private consumption in&#13;
GMD hardly declines at all between 1981 and 1990; in the Base Run, with&#13;
foreign savings only 15 percent of the total, private consumption falls to&#13;
less than 67 percent of GDP from the 1981 value of 70 percent.         Experiment&#13;
C-4, with the real exchange rate appreciation, is even more extreme, as the&#13;
foreign share of savings declines to only 5 percent, and the private&#13;
consumption share drops    to 64 percent of GDP.       The cause of this large&#13;
movement can be traced to the steady real appreciation of the exchange rate,&#13;
which reduces the purchasing power of foreign savings as measured by the&#13;
dollar trade balance.    In other words, although the export/GDP ratio of 17.2&#13;
percent in Experiment C-4 is nearly identical to that reached in C-2 and C-3,&#13;
because of the exchange rate appreciation this quantity of exports only "buys"&#13;
enough imports to attain an imports/GDP ratio of 18.6 percent, rather than&#13;
almost 23 percent in Experiments C-2 and C-3.      With the investment/GDP ratio&#13;
fixed at 24 percent,    the bulk of this reduction in imports occurs at the&#13;
expense of private consumption, resulting in the 64 percent share.&#13;
Table 4.8 presents measures of the impact of the foreign exchange&#13;
regimes underlying the five runs. In the Base Run, the premium rate necessary&#13;
to effectively ration imports rises in the middle of the period as the&#13;
repayment "bulge" is reached, although the 10 percent level in 1984 remains&#13;
quite moderate in comparison to the high rates from the 1978-80 foreign&#13;
exchange crisis period a/   By 1990 imports are essentially unconstrained.    The&#13;
potential rents arising from the rationing scheme as a share of value added&#13;

follow a similar pattern. This ratio reflects both the premium rate movements&#13;
and the assumption that the continued existence of rents over a long period of&#13;
time leads to a greater waste of resources by producers in 'chasing' them.&#13;
The higher productivity growth run, Experiment C-1, exhibits an&#13;
import premium rate pattern similar to the Base Run, although it is higher for&#13;
all periods from 1984 on. This results from the fact that with higher growth,&#13;
import demand rises; with the nominal dollar value of exports identical to&#13;
that in the Base Run, this higher import demand must be rationed by increased&#13;
premium rates.    Again,  it should be noted that the premium rates in this&#13;
experiment are relatively low by historical standards, and are not at all&#13;
comparable to the severe import shortages associated with the 1978-80 foreign&#13;
exchange crisis.&#13;
The two pessimistic export runs (C-2 and C-3) have very different&#13;
import rationing implications than the relatively moderate story *portrayed for&#13;
the Base Run. In Experiment C-2, when real export growth is reduced by around&#13;
2.0 percentage points yearly, the accompanying squeeze on import availability&#13;
results in the premium rate rising from 3.8 percent in 1981 to 28 percent in&#13;
1990. The share of potential import rents in value added rises to a sizeable&#13;
7.1 percent by 1990 as well. In Experiment C-3, where the same export pattern&#13;
as' C-2 is imposed, the import squeeze is less severe since the additional&#13;
petroleum price increase specified in Experiment C-2 does not occur.        Also,&#13;
with lower investment growth, the demand for imported capital goods is lower,&#13;
so that the 1990 premium rate is only 19 percent.&#13;
Finally, Experiment C-4 illustrates the crucial role played by&#13;
exchange rate policy in maintaining the export impetus throughout the&#13;
remainder of the decade.      Although the export performance in this run is&#13;
similar to that in Experiments C-2 and C-3, because it occurs in conjunction&#13;

as a result of premium rationing.&#13;
with the steady real appreciation of the exchange rate, the foreign exchange&#13;
implications are quite different.     Because exchange rate appreciation makes&#13;
imports cheaper relative to domestic goods, the demand for imports rises&#13;
substantially relative to C-2 and C-3, so that the premium rate necessary to&#13;
reduce  import   demand  to   the  available  amount   of  foreign  exchange   is&#13;
correspondingly higher. The premium rate under this scenario rises to over 40&#13;
percent by 1990, which roughly parallels the premium rates from the 1979-80&#13;
period.   The lesson that emerges from this experiment, when compared to C-2&#13;
and C-3, is that the causes of reduced exports matter a great deal. If, as is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
the case in Experiments C-2 and C-3, the reduced level of exports results from&#13;
lack of foreign demand for Turkish products or an inability by Turkish&#13;
exporters to rapidly penetrate new export markets, the consequences are much&#13;
less severe than if this lower export performance occurs as a result of a&#13;
steady drift of the real exchange rate, thereby resurrecting the historical&#13;
Turkish bias against exports in favor of import substitution.&#13;
In conclusion, it appears that if the Turkish export promotion&#13;
policies are successful, as is portrayed in the Base Run and Experiment C-1,&#13;
the Turkish economy should be able to achieve growth rates in excess of 6&#13;
percent by the second half of the decade, with no indication that another&#13;
period of foreign exchange disequilibrium is on the horizon.     However, as the&#13;
remaining experiments illustrate, if certain of the policies and projections&#13;
underlying this relatively optimistic scenario are not achieved, than the&#13;
Turkish economy could grow more slowly, with increasing import scarcity&#13;
resulting from foreign exchange shortages.&#13;
E. Sectoral Implications of Alternative Trade Scenarios&#13;
The following section presents the outlines of the sectoral&#13;
structure of output, exports and imports in the Forward Base Run, and&#13;
contrasts this with two of the alternative runs, Experiments C-2 and C-3.&#13;
Table 4.9 presents the exogenously specified annual export growth rates for&#13;
each period for the thirteen sectors contained in the model.           While the&#13;
sectoral pattern presented here is an amalgam of projections from various&#13;
sources, the overall pattern reflects the tremendous boom in export growth&#13;
that occurred in 1981-82 and the assumption that export growth will taper off&#13;
until 1984, at which time the aggregate growth rate of real exports is&#13;
projected to stabilize at around 10 percent annually.       Incorporated in this&#13;
sectoral pattern of growth rates is the government's intention to encourage&#13;

Table 4.10 presents the sectoral pattern of import growth for the&#13;

sectoral import growth rates have some trend component but are also responsive&#13;

imports remains stable at 9.5 percent per annum for 1984-90, with only minor&#13;
swings in the growth trends for most sectors.     Petroleum imports are forecast&#13;
to grow relatively steadily at an average rate of 6.3 percent, which&#13;
represents a real petroleum import to GDP elasticity of approximately 1.12.&#13;
Although this elasticity is not very high, recall that even in the Base Run,&#13;
the dollar price of petroleum is projected to rise relative to other imported&#13;
goods, thereby encouraging continued conservation in petroleum use and&#13;
substitution of alternative energy sources where possible.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
As noted above, in addition to the responsivity of imports to&#13;
changes in the relative prices of domestic and imported goods, there is also&#13;
some exogenous trend component in the import growth rates.     This is necessary&#13;
to reflect two phenomena.    First, the historical evidence suggests that as a&#13;
result of the severe foreign exchange crises that beset the Turkish economy&#13;
twice during the 1970s, Turkish import usage has been substantially&#13;
depressed. Support for this is evident in the enormous increase in the value&#13;
share of petroleum and petroleum products in the total import bill throughout&#13;
the last decade, which has acted to "crowd out" imports of investment and&#13;
consumer  goods.    Second,  one common counterpart of successful export-led&#13;
growth is a concurrent liberalization in import use, as the ready availability&#13;
of foreign exchange at a correctly valued exchange rate permits increased&#13;
reliance  on imports   of  a wide   range of goods.      In simulating Turkey's&#13;
performance over the remainder of the decade, these two effects together&#13;
implied that imports would have an "autonomous" trend component, reflecting&#13;
the belief that even if the relative price of domestic and imported goods&#13;
remained constant, the dependence on imports would increase.&#13;
The effect of these shifts is apparent in the import growth figures&#13;
in Table 4.10. The largest trends were assumed for the consumer good sectors&#13;
(agriculture, food processing, textiles, and light intermediates), with&#13;
smaller trends for the other import sectors.     The negative growth of imports&#13;
in the mining sectors reflects the fact that, given the relatively large&#13;
investment planned for these small sectors, imports will be reduced to reflect&#13;
the rapid growth in domestic supply. While the sectoral pattern of exogenous&#13;
import growth is somewhat arbitrary, since it is invariant across runs, it has&#13;
virtually no effect on any comparative results.&#13;
Because of the importance of agriculture in the Turkish economy, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
role of agricultural exports and imports deserves additional comment.&#13;
Agricultural exports over the 1982-90 period are projected to grow at an&#13;
annual average rate of 4.0 percent, which is only slightly higher than the&#13;
growth rate of agricultural output for the same period (3.1 percent).        The&#13;
justification for such conservative estimates of agricultural exports emerges&#13;
from the general equilibrium interaction of a number of influences within the&#13;
CGE model.    First, the food processing sector, which requires substantial&#13;
intermediate inputs from the agricultural sector, is projected to grow quite&#13;
rapidly during the period. Second, on the final demand side, household demand&#13;
for agricultural products represents a sizeable (around 28 percent) portion of&#13;
total private consumption in 1981.      While some decline in its share might&#13;
occur as real incomes rise, the significant growth in real consumption&#13;
projected for the 1982-90 period (it grows nearly as rapidly as GDP in the&#13;
Base Run) implies that private consumption demand for agricultural commodities&#13;
will  continue  to  grow  rapidly   as well.    Even with   the  quite moderate&#13;
agricultural export forecasts embodied in the Base Run, the net effect of&#13;
these other forces in the CGE model (where prices adjust endogenously to clear&#13;
markets) is to bring about an increase in the agricultural terms of trade (the&#13;
relative price of agriculture compared to the weighted average price of all&#13;
other commodities). While it is true that when GDP is growing faster than&#13;
agricultural output, increasing demand for agricultural products might be&#13;
expected to produce some favorable change in the agricultural terms of trade,&#13;
permitting more rapid growth of exports leads to unreasonably high increases&#13;
in the agricultural terms of trade over the entire period.      This conclusion&#13;
stems from the judgment that the government, which plays an important price-&#13;
setting role in the agricultural sector, would be unwilling in the medium term&#13;
to permit agricultural prices and incomes to rise to the extent necessary to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71-&#13;
permit greater exports.    As the final line in Table 4.7 shows, even with the&#13;
moderate agricultural export growth of the Base Run, the agricultural terms of&#13;
trade rise from 100 in 1981 to nearly 120 in 1990, corresponding to a 2&#13;
percent annual increase in the relative price of agricultural goods.        Since&#13;
one way of alleviating this pressure on domestic demand is to increase&#13;
agricultural imports, one possible conclusion that emerges is that if Turkey&#13;
hopes to exploit more fully the opportunities for agricultural exports,&#13;
Turkish authorities must recognize that imports of basic food crops may have&#13;
to rise as the shift to cash export crops reduce Turkey's traditional&#13;
agricultural   self-sufficiency.     Finally,  even   with  the  relatively   low&#13;
agricultural export growth rates and higher import growth rates used in the&#13;
Base Run, the agricultural sector trade surplus would still increase by more&#13;
than 150 percent between 1981 and 1990 ($1.127 billion surplus in 1981 versus&#13;
$2.902 billion in 1990).&#13;
In Experiment C-1, with higher GDP growth but the same agricultural&#13;
exports as the Base Run, there is even more demand pressure placed on&#13;
available domestic agricultural production, so that the agricultural terms of&#13;
trade increase even more dramatically to 126.4 in 1990, for a 2.6 percent&#13;
annual   increase.     In  Experiment   C-3,   where  agricultural   output   and&#13;
agricultural exports are both projected to be lower than in the Base Run, the&#13;
net effect is again to raise the agricultural terms of trade to 128.3.&#13;
A summary of the investment allocation shares specified in the&#13;
Forward Base Run and Experiments C-2 and C-3 is presented in Table 4.11. The&#13;
trend in the structure of public investment, which is common to all&#13;
experiments, reflects the changes planned in the focus of the Public Sector&#13;
Investment Program in the coming years, with greater emphasis to be placed on&#13;
agriculture and coal mining, and a corresponding reduction in the share of&#13;

public  sector  investment   going  to  manufacturing   sectors.    The  private&#13;
investment structure illustrates the increase in the manufacturing sector&#13;
share from 25 to 40 percent, matched by a decline in the share allocated to&#13;
the service sectors. The allocation among manufacturing sectors in the 1982-&#13;
90 period occurs endogenously, with sectors with higher rental rates receiving&#13;
larger proportions of the manufacturing share.&#13;
The second half of Table 4.11 shows the total investment shares&#13;
determined endogenously in each of the three runs.      Since the public shares&#13;
are identical among runs, and the private shares vary only slightly, the&#13;
differences in the total shares in the various runs result from different&#13;
public and private proportions of aggregate investment, which are the weights&#13;
used in obtaining the total shares.    In the Base Run, where the public share&#13;
of total investment is reduced to 42.4 percent in 1990, the total allocation&#13;
of investment more closely resembles the private allocation, with relatively&#13;
large shares going to housing and public services and the manufacturing&#13;
sectors.   In Experiments C-2 and C-3, where the public share of investment&#13;
declines to only around 50 percent in 1990, the share of electricity, gas and&#13;
water and mining is higher, reflecting the larger importance of public&#13;
investment in the total.      Although not enormous, the differences in the&#13;
patterns of total investment that emerge from these alternative runs indicate&#13;
that the success of the government in reducing its role in the investment&#13;
process will have tangible effects on the aggregate allocation of investment&#13;
in the 1982-90 period.&#13;
The next three tables (Tables 4.12, 4.13, and 4.14) present the&#13;
growth and structure of exports, imports and production in the Forward Base&#13;
Run and Experiments C-2 and C-3.     As is evident in the first half of Table&#13;
4.12, the reduction of export growth simulated in Experiments C-2 and C-3 has&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

been carried out proportionately in all sectors except transportation        and&#13;
other services (which corresponds to the non-factor services component&#13;
of the balance of payments).     The export/output ratios shown in the second&#13;
half of the table reveal that in the sectors for which export growth is&#13;
projected to be the highest, the share of exports in sectoral output will&#13;
still be relatively small, ranging between 5.2-6.2 percent for the light&#13;
intermediates sector and 9.5-10.7 in the machinery sector. This indicates the&#13;
potential for even more rapid growth in these sectors, a conclusion that is&#13;
reinforced for these two sectors by the steady increase throughout the 1982-90&#13;
period of the ratio of the export price to the domestic price, which provides&#13;
a rough measure of incentives to exporters.&#13;
Table 4.13 depicts the growth in imports under the three scenarios.&#13;
It should be recalled that import demand is the endogenous outcome of a whole&#13;
range of price-responsive substitution processes, so that there is much more&#13;
variability in import growth rates among runs than export growth rates.      The&#13;
higher import premium rates forecast for Experiments C-2 and C-3 (see Table&#13;
4.8) are translated directly into higher domestic prices for imports, and&#13;
since the elasticity of import demand to price changes varies among&#13;
commodities, certain sectors show a more precipitous decline in import growth&#13;
than others as premium rationing of imports becomes more pronounced.       Since&#13;
agriculture and other consumer goods imports are considered in the model to be&#13;
more substitutable with domestic products, it is these sectors (agriculture,&#13;
food processing, textiles and light intermediates) that show the largest&#13;
decline in import growth rates.&#13;
Finally,  Table  4.14  summarizes  the structure of production and&#13;
output growth rates from the three runs.    For the most part, the structure of&#13;
production  in   1990 is  quite  similar  among  the   three  runs.   The slower&#13;

agricultural growth rate in Experiment C-3 results in a somewhat lower share&#13;
of agriculture in total output than in the other runs. Most of the decline in&#13;
the average growth rate of total output between the Base Run and the two&#13;
experiments featuring lower export growth occurs within the manufacturing&#13;
sectors, which is not surprising given that this is where much of the export&#13;
decline occurs as well.&#13;
F. Sources Decomposition of Output Growth, 1981-90&#13;
The sources of growth methodology used in Section 3 in analyzing the&#13;
last two decades of Turkish growth and structural change provides a useful&#13;
tool for examining the viability and characteristics of the ongoing shift in&#13;
Turkey to an export-led strategy for the 1980s.&#13;
Table 4.15 presents the results of the sources of growth&#13;
decomposition for the Forward Base Run and Experiment C-2, in which lower&#13;
export growth and lower foreign capital inflows are projected.L/       The total&#13;
decomposition measure has been used to obtain these results, so that the&#13;
contribution of,   for  example,  export  expansion  to output   growth  in the&#13;
agricultural sector includes not only the direct effect of an increase in&#13;
agricultural  sector exports but also the indirect effects associated with&#13;
export growth in other sectors such as food processing that use agricultural&#13;
sector inputs.&#13;
The remarkable contribution of export growth in total output change&#13;
is evident in the first panel of Table 4.15, which portrays the results for&#13;
the Base Run over the 1981-84 period. While domestic demand expansion remains&#13;
the single most important factor in overall output growth, export expansion&#13;
1/  As was true for the 1978-81 results examined earlier, the contribution of&#13;
changes in input-output coefficients to output growth is quite small,&#13;
since only the coefficients in the petroleum and coal sectors were&#13;
permitted to change in response to relative price movements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
represents nearly 40 percent of the total.       Furthermore,  in the important&#13;
export sectors (agriculture, mining, and manufacturing) the contribution of&#13;
exports exceeds 50 percent of the total, with the agriculture sector&#13;
exhibiting a striking 75 percent contribution by exports alone.         As noted&#13;
earlier, the growth of agricultural exports is projected to be low relative to&#13;
other sectors; however, the strong linkage between agriculture and food&#13;
processing together with the rapid growth in food processing exports combine&#13;
to make the export contribution to agricultural growth very strong.          The&#13;
results in the agriculture sector also reinforce the earlier discussion of the&#13;
shift in the agricultural terms of trade - with over 75 percent of increased&#13;
agricultural output destined (directly and indirectly) for exports, the growth&#13;
of domestic supply is curtailed, and in the absence of increased agricultural&#13;
imports (as evident in the low contribution of import substitution), the&#13;
domestic price of agricultural products must rise.     The overall contribution&#13;
to output growth of import substitution is negative, signifying increased&#13;
import dependence and the pursuit of more liberal import policies, and a&#13;
reversal of the traditional Turkish dependence on industrialization behind&#13;
import barriers.   However, during the 1981-84 period, this increased import&#13;
dependence is relatively small, and the 40 percent positive contribution of&#13;
export expansion dominates the 4 percent negative contribution of import&#13;
substitution. This reflects the fact that in the short run, even rapid export&#13;
growth will not permit substantial increased dependence on imports because of&#13;
the debt repayment requirements over the period.&#13;
In the latter half of the decade, however, the outlook changes&#13;
considerably, as the results for 1984-90 in the second panel of Table 4.15&#13;
show. The tapering off of export growth to around 10 percent in real terms is&#13;
mirrored in the decline of the contribution of export expansion to less than&#13;

29 percent across all sectors for the period; the contribution in the key&#13;
export sectors is around 40 percent.      The contribution of domestic demand&#13;
expansion rises to over 80 percent, while the negative contribution of import&#13;
substitution also increases to almost 13 percent, reflecting the increased&#13;
import expenditure possible as a result of sustained rapid export growth and a&#13;
decline in the current account balance as repayment obligations fall.&#13;
The final two panels of Table 4.15 contrast the results for the&#13;
entire period (1981-90) in the Base Run and Experiment C-2, in which export&#13;
growth and foreign capital inflows are lower, and the economy becomes&#13;
increasingly import-rationed throughout the period (see Table 4.8). While the&#13;
contribution of domestic demand expansion is nearly identical in the two runs&#13;
at around 79 percent, Experiment C-2 shows a smaller contribution by export&#13;
expansion (26 percent vs. 32 percent) and a corresponding reduction in the&#13;
extent of the increase in import dependence (6 percent vs. 10 percent in the&#13;
Base Run).&#13;
The substantial increase in the contribution of export expansion to&#13;
output growth projected for the manufacturing sector raises obvious questions&#13;
as to whether too much is being expected of the Turkish manufacturing&#13;
sector. Table 4.16 presents the results of similar decompositions carried out&#13;
for other industrializing countries.     In all of the countries portrayed in&#13;
Table 4.16, the periods presented were broadly characterized by export&#13;
promotion policies in conjunction with import controls of varying severity, as&#13;
is forecast for Turkey throughout the 1981-90 period.&#13;
As Table 4.16 shows, the projected contribution of export expansion&#13;
to output growth in manufacturing is significant, but within the range of&#13;
experience of other countries pursuing similar policies.     Direct comparisons&#13;
with Japan and Yugoslavia are difficult because of the large role played by&#13;
changes in input-output coefficients during the periods studied.&#13;

G. Conclusion&#13;
The conclusion that emerges from this analysis of Turkey's medium-&#13;
term prospects is one of guarded optimism.     The shift toward a more outward-&#13;
oriented development strategy has already begun to produce tangible results,&#13;
as evident in the tremendous upsurge in exports in 1981-82 and the alleviation&#13;
of the foreign exchange shortage and import rationing distortions of the&#13;
1978-80  period.    As  the  Forward  Base  Run demonstrates,   if the   outward&#13;
orientation is maintained and real export growth of 10 percent annually can be&#13;
sustained throughout the second half of the decade, then GDP growth rates will&#13;
rise above 6 percent.     However, as the other scenarios described in this&#13;
section suggest, this relatively optimistic Base Run is dependent on an&#13;
interrelated combination of government policies and specific forecasts of&#13;
world conditions.   Of critical importance to the Base Run conclusions is the&#13;
assumption that the government will continue to encourage exporters by&#13;
pursuing an exchange rate policy that will prevent incentives from drifting&#13;
against exports and producing a bias in favor of costly import substitution.&#13;
The role accorded to private savings and investment in the Base Run is large,&#13;
with real private investment forecast to rise at almost 17 percent annually in&#13;
the 1982-86 period.   Such rapid growth is in turn dependent on recovery from&#13;
currently depressed levels of domestic demand and a restoration of private&#13;
investors' confidence in Turkey's medium-term prospects.      Finally, the Base&#13;
Run is contingent on the projections of international conditions embodied in&#13;
the exogenous data.   Continued recession in Turkey's major trading partners,&#13;
increased trade barriers, or further 'shocks' to the economic environment&#13;
similar to the oil price increases in the 1970s could yield another episode of&#13;
increasing foreign exchange shortage and major economic disruption.&#13;

Appendix I: The Turkey CGE Model&#13;
The model currently being used is a descendant of the TGT (Turkey&#13;
Growth and Trade) model developed by Dervis and Robinson for the Bank Mission&#13;
to Turkey of April, 1979. The report of that mission has been published and a&#13;
thorough exposition of that earlier model is available.1/          This appendix&#13;
describes the features of the new model, emphasizing major changes and&#13;
enhancements that have been implemented since the earlier work.       A parallel&#13;
model with many similar features has also been developed for Yugoslavia by&#13;
Robinson and Tyson.     That model has been used to analyze the impact of&#13;
adjustment policies in Yugoslavia.&#13;
A. The CGE Model Formulation&#13;
The overall CGE model is divided into a static, annual general&#13;
equilibrium model and a separate between-period model which provides the&#13;
necessary intertemporal linkages.      The static model is described     in some&#13;
detail in this section, after which the structure of the intertemporal model&#13;
is presented.&#13;
A.1 Product Markets and Factor Supplies&#13;
There are 13 sectors or product markets in the Turkey CGE model. The&#13;
model assumes that each sector produces a single good, and for each such good&#13;
formulates conditions of supply and demand.     Since most of these markets are&#13;
for tradeable goods - that is goods for which there are exports and/or imports&#13;
in the input-output and national accounts - it is useful to begin the&#13;
discussion with the model's specification of export and import behavior.      The&#13;
model assumes that domestically produced goods and imports are imperfect&#13;
1/ See World Bank (1980a) and Dervis and Robinson (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-2 -&#13;
substitutes.   For each of these sectors, the model defines a "composite" good&#13;
which is an aggregation of the domestic good and the imported substitute.&#13;
This trade aggregation function is represented by a CES specification, in&#13;
which the elasticity of substitution between the domestic good and imported&#13;
substitute plays an important role.    Elasticities of substitution vary across&#13;
sectors, with smaller elasticities reflecting greater differences between the&#13;
domestic and imported good, and hence greater difficulty in substituting one&#13;
for the other in response to changes in their relative prices.       For Turkey,&#13;
the elasticity used in agriculture is quite high, those for the consumer goods&#13;
sectors   more   moderate    (e.g.   food   processing,    textiles   and   light&#13;
intermediates), and those for capital goods and petroleum quite low,&#13;
reflecting the difficulty of substituting limited domestic substitutes for&#13;
these  imported  commodities.  1/     Assuming  that users of a good seek to&#13;
minimize the cost of acquiring it, this formulation yields the result that the&#13;
desired ratio of the imported substitute to the domestically produced good is&#13;
a  function  of  the  ratio  of  their  prices.    Following   the  small-country&#13;
assumption, the world price of the imported substitute is assumed fixed by&#13;
world market conditions over which Turkey has no influence, and the supply of&#13;
imports to Turkey is infinitely elastic at that price.     The domestic price of&#13;
the import substitute is determined by the world price, the tariff rate, the&#13;
premium rate on imports and the exchange rate 2/&#13;
Two different portrayals of the operation of export markets are&#13;
currently  possible.    In some runs,    it is assumed that the small-country&#13;
assumption applies on the export side as well, so that the price at which&#13;
1/ See the data tables in Appendix II.&#13;
2/ The exact algebraic form of this and other relations can be seen in&#13;
Section C of this Appendix.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-3 -&#13;
Turkey can sell its exports is determined by the world price. Consistent with&#13;
this specification, the model will assume that Turkish exports are a function&#13;
of domestic supply conditions rather than foreign demand conditions.      This is&#13;
often modelled by setting sectoral export targets exogenously. Alternatively,&#13;
since frequently the domestic currency price of an export may not equal its&#13;
price on the domestic market, one can specify that exporters have an upward-&#13;
sloping supply curve for exports, where the relevant price is the ratio of the&#13;
domestic currency price of exports to the domestic price.     In other runs, the&#13;
model requires   that export markets clear through equilibrating supply and&#13;
demand functions, in which case export supply in each sector depends on the&#13;
ratio of the export price to the domestic price, and the world demand for&#13;
Turkish exports is given by a downward sloping demand curve.&#13;
Finally, in the model, the absolute price level is set exogenously&#13;
and is given by a weighted index of sectoral prices.       Because the CGE model&#13;
focuses on the determination of relative prices among sectors and real&#13;
variables in the economy, the inflation rate of this aggregate price index&#13;
must be given to the model exogenously.      In other words, the model does not&#13;
solve for the inflation rate but rather for relative prices and sectoral&#13;
outputs given an exogenously specified time path of the aggregate price level.&#13;
Domestic prices influence supply and demand decisions in all&#13;
sectors.   On the supply side, it is necessary to specify for each sector of&#13;
production the technological conditions and the behavioral rules that&#13;
influence supply decisions    in response   to changing prices.    Technological&#13;
constraints  are  given   by  a  production  function  for  each   sector.    The&#13;
production functions chosen allow for substitution between types of labor and&#13;
between labor and capital inputs.     While fixed input-output coefficients are&#13;
generally used, substitution between intermediate inputs and capital and labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-4 -&#13;
is permitted under certain specifications (see Section B below). In addition,&#13;
within intermediate inputs, substitution among types of energy in production&#13;
in response to relative price changes is captured by adjusting the input-&#13;
output coefficients of energy inputs (petroleum and coal).&#13;
There are several additional points to note about the production&#13;
function formulation being used.     Sectoral capital stocks are fixed within&#13;
periods, reflecting the assumption that capital cannot be moved across sectors&#13;
once installed.    Sectoral capital stocks are updated period to period by&#13;
subtracting depreciation and adding net investment in the dynamic part of the&#13;
CGF. model. In the model, sectoral capacity utilization is a function of the&#13;
overall degree of import rationing in the economy and of the dependence of an&#13;
individual sector on imported intermediate inputs (see Section B below). This&#13;
formulation   reflects  the  view   that  temporary  shortages   or  delays  in&#13;
intermediate imported inputs can have an effect on domestic output levels. In&#13;
sectors in which substitution possibilities between energy sources (coal and&#13;
petroleum) or between aggregate intermediate inputs and aggregate value added&#13;
are permitted, there are also assumed to be adjustment costs in the form of&#13;
lowered capacity utilization that prevent the full cost-reduction benefits of&#13;
the substitution from accruing immediately. Finally, in the production&#13;
function, the labor input is an aggregation of labor of different types. The&#13;
model identifies   four such types:     unskilled labor employed in the non-&#13;
agricultural sectors, including workers with lower professional education,&#13;
semi-skilled workers, and unskilled workers; skilled labor employed in the&#13;
non-agricultural sectors, including the remaining skill and educational labor&#13;
categories; agricultural labor (appearing only in agriculture); and labor&#13;
employed in the urban service sectors (appearing only in the service sector).&#13;
In both agricultural and the non-agricultural sectors, output supply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-5 -&#13;
is simply determined by available inputs and is given by the production&#13;
function.   In forward runs of the model,      input supplies and hence output&#13;
levels in these sectors are projected exogenously.      In historical runs, they&#13;
are set at their historical levels.       In the non-agricultural sectors that&#13;
comprise the core of the model, however, output supply depends not only on&#13;
technology but also on the behavioral rules guiding the output and employment&#13;
decisions of individual producers.    The firm's decision to hire a new worker&#13;
depends on a comparison between the market wage and the marginal value product&#13;
of that worker.     Aggregate demand for labor of each type is obtained by&#13;
summing  over  the  individual  sectoral  demands.    On the supply side,     the&#13;
supplies of each labor type are fixed exogenously during each static period&#13;
and updated dynamically.    Wages adjust to clear the labor markets.      In the&#13;
dynamic part of the model, labor supplies can be adjusted to allow for the&#13;
gradual migration of agricultural labor into the non-agricultural pool.&#13;
A.2 Foreign Trade&#13;
In the model, total foreign exchange available for imports depends&#13;
not only on export earnings, but also on available foreign capital inflows.&#13;
The CGE model distinguishes four different sources of capital flows:          net&#13;
remittance inflows; net factor service income; foreign borrowing net of&#13;
amortization and interest payments; and changes in official foreign exchange&#13;
holdings. In historical runs of the model, each of these capital flows is set&#13;
at its actual annual dollar value for each year; in forward runs, the dollar&#13;
values of these are set exogenously according to the projections undertaken as&#13;
part of the CEM Mission review of external creditworthiness.&#13;
As noted earlier, desired imports by sector depend on the relative&#13;
prices of imports and imperfect domestic substitutes.       With an equilibrium&#13;
exchange rate, the market for foreign exchange must clear, so that total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-6 -&#13;
expenditures on imports must be equal to the sum of total exports, net foreign&#13;
capital flows, and reserve changes.       With a disequilibrium exchange rate,&#13;
however, there is no guarantee that desired imports will not exceed export&#13;
earnings and net foreign capital inflows, so the model must specify how to&#13;
reduce import demand or otherwise bring the foreign exchange market into&#13;
equilibrium. Currently, four alternative methods of achieving equilibrium in&#13;
the  foreign  exchange  market  are  possible.    The  first  two are   the most&#13;
familiar: first, allow the exchange rate to respond flexibly to supply-demand&#13;
imbalance, since raising the exchange rate will make imports more expensive,&#13;
and exports cheaper, to external purchasers; second, one can leave the&#13;
exchange rate fixed and allow net capital inflow to increase (or decrease) to&#13;
achieve balance.&#13;
The model also allows for two other possible policy regimes to&#13;
restrict actual imports to the total of available foreign exchange. The first&#13;
regime is a simple quantity rationing scheme. Sectors are allowed to obtain a&#13;
certain exogenously specified fraction of their desired imports, reflecting&#13;
both the existence of differential controls on imports of raw materials,&#13;
capital goods, and consumer goods, and the preferential treatment of priority&#13;
sectors in import rationing.    This quantity rationing regime is a "fixprice"&#13;
regime in the sense that the user-price of foreign exchange remains fixed at&#13;
the official rate in spite of an overall shortage.&#13;
The final alternative is to model a flexible-price (or "flexprice")&#13;
rationing  scheme,  called rationing by premium.       In contrast   to fixprice&#13;
rationing, in flexprice rationing those who demand foreign exchange for&#13;
imports bid up the actual price of foreign exchange until at the new price the&#13;
demand  for  foreign  exchange equals   the supply.     Under  this  system,  the&#13;
demanders of foreign exchange have to pay a premium over the official exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-7 -&#13;
rate in order to obtain the foreign exchange they need.      The complexities of&#13;
these import rationing schemes and their impact on economic behavior are more&#13;
fully discussed in Section B.&#13;
A.3 Income and Product Demand&#13;
To complete the static CGE model, it is necessary to develop the&#13;
demand side of the model. This is accomplished by tracing through the incomes&#13;
generated by the production of output in the economy and the various demands&#13;
they induce.    There are three kinds of recipients of income in the model:&#13;
productive enterprises in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors;&#13;
households;  and  the government.     The model contains an elaborate set of&#13;
accounting and behavioral rules to determine how value-added or factor income&#13;
generated in the course of production is distributed among these different&#13;
income recipients.   Basically, the distribution of value added in each sector&#13;
depends on: (1) the size of the wage portion in total value added; (2)&#13;
enterprise decisions about the distribution of their net income between&#13;
savings and distributed profits; and (3) the various taxes that influence the&#13;
distribution of value added between the private and government sectors.&#13;
To obtain components of demand for output, the model specifies&#13;
saving and expenditure behavior for the three types of income recipients&#13;
identified.    The  income  remaining  with agricultural   and non-agricultural&#13;
enterprises after they have distributed wage incomes to their workers is&#13;
assumed either to be distributed to owners of capital or retained by the&#13;
enterprise and therefore made available for investment expenditure in fixed or&#13;
working capital.   The income flowing into the government sector from various&#13;
taxes and other contributions from households and enterprises is used for two&#13;
basic purposes: to finance government expenditures on the output of the&#13;
productive  sectors,  and   to  finance  investment.    Finally,  households  are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-8 -&#13;
assumed to save a fraction of their disposable (after tax) income and to spend&#13;
the rest on the output of the productive and non-productive sectors.&#13;
Household income in the model is defined to include the inflow of foreign&#13;
remittances.&#13;
In the model, total investment activity in the economy can either be&#13;
specified as determined by the available supply of savings, or a fixed&#13;
investment/GDP proportion can be maintained by requiring savings rates of&#13;
certain groups to adjust, or a mixture of the two in which the public&#13;
investment/GDP   ratio  is   fixed  but   private  investment   is  endogenously&#13;
determined according to fixed savings rates.&#13;
The total amount of investment funds is distributed among different&#13;
sectors by exogenously specified shares that can be adjusted from model run to&#13;
model run and from period to period within a run.        The sectoral shares of&#13;
investment are an important policy variable in the model, capturing the&#13;
effects of policy-induced allocations of capital among priority sectors and&#13;
barriers to capital mobility across sectors.      The implications of different&#13;
investment strategies on economic performance can be analyzed and contrasted&#13;
by comparing the model results under alternative assumptions about the&#13;
sectoral distribution of investment funds.     This is further discussed in the&#13;
next section of this appendix.&#13;
The investment allocation shares by sector specify the distribution&#13;
of investment demand by sector of destination, that is by the sector in which&#13;
additions to the capital stock actually occur. Investment by sector of origin&#13;
in turn refers to the demand for the output of a particular sector that&#13;
results from the investment activity or additions to capacity occurring in a&#13;
sector of destination, and is obtained through the use of a capital&#13;
coefficients matrix.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-9 -&#13;
In addition to investment demand for output, the model distinguishes&#13;
intermediate demand and total consumption demand, encompassing both personal&#13;
and government consumption.&#13;
A.4 Market Clearing Conditions&#13;
According to the CGE model formulation, for a given set of sectoral&#13;
domestic prices and the exchange rate, it is possible to specify both sectoral&#13;
supplies and sectoral demands.     Market clearing requires that prices adjust&#13;
until the resulting sectoral supplies and demands are equal.&#13;
The task of the static, within-period CGE model is to find a set of&#13;
wages and prices such that these labor and product market clearing conditions&#13;
are satisfied and such that the total demand for foreign exchange is&#13;
consistent  with  the  available   supply  of  foreign  exchange.    A   solution&#13;
represents an economy-wide equilibrium in labor and product markets and in the&#13;
foreign exchange market, given exogenously specified market constraints and&#13;
sectoral availabilities of labor and capital.      The model solution does not&#13;
represent a neoclassical free-market equilibrium.      But it does represent a&#13;
market equilibrium solution constrained by behavioral and institutional&#13;
specifications believed to represent a realistic picture of the Turkish&#13;
economy.&#13;
A.5 The Dynamic CGE Model&#13;
In general, the role of the dynamic phase of the CGE model is to&#13;
update all   the  exogenous variable entering    the static model.      The most&#13;
important exogenous variables that need updating include: world ($) prices of&#13;
imports and exports; the nominal exchange rate; the domestic price index; the&#13;
sectoral allocation of investment funds, and the resulting changes in sectoral&#13;
capital stocks; the growth of the different categories of domestic labor; and&#13;
the net foreign capital inflow figures.      Some variables (remittance flows,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-10 -&#13;
household consumption behavior, the growth of domestic labor supplies) are&#13;
updated using simple time trends, growth rates or exogenous projections.&#13;
Others are updated to reflect assumptions about the likely effects of policy&#13;
instruments. In forward runs of the model for the purposes of plan analysis,&#13;
the projections of the Bank's RMSM model are used whenever possible to adjust&#13;
exogenous foreign capital inflow variables.&#13;
B. Modifications in the CGE Model&#13;
The most important changes from the earlier TGT model can be&#13;
classified into three areas, each of which is discussed in further detail&#13;
below:&#13;
(1) Foreign trade regime. One of the strengths of the CGE model is&#13;
its ability to simulate the effect of various foreign trade regimes on trade,&#13;
resource allocation and growth. With Turkey facing severe balance of payments&#13;
crises throughout the late 1970's and into the early 1980's, modeling the&#13;
foreign trade regime has required the specification of increasingly more&#13;
sophisticated institutions and behavior on both the import side (mixed&#13;
quantity and premium rationing) and export side (complex export subsidy and&#13;
tax rebate schemes).&#13;
(2) Investment allocation. In Turkey, the government plays a major&#13;
role in the allocation of investment resources through its control over the&#13;
Public Investment Program.    It is therefore important to distinguish between&#13;
the allocation of public investment, which is a policy instrument easily&#13;
controlled by the government, and private investment, which is influenced by&#13;
the full range of market profitability criteria and can be affected only&#13;
indirectly by government policy choices.&#13;
(3)  Production technology.    In a period notable for the frequency&#13;
and magnitude of shocks to the relative price structure, the normal modeling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-11 -&#13;
specification   of   a   fixed   production   technology   becomes   undesirably&#13;
restrictive, especially where one is attempting to focus on projections over&#13;
the medium term in which some input substitution could be expected to occur.&#13;
B.1 The Foreign Trade Regime&#13;
The most complex aspect of the foreign exchange regime in Turkey has&#13;
been the combination of mechanisms used to ration imports during periods of&#13;
foreign exchange shortage.     The earlier version of the model permitted the&#13;
specification of either quantity or premium rationing schemes to allocate&#13;
available imports among competing users; however, the events of the 1978-81&#13;
crisis have illustrated that frequently both systems were used simultaneously.&#13;
The adaptation of the model to capture the features of a "mixed" system of&#13;
quantity and premium rationing permits a more realistic and flexible portrayal&#13;
of the intricacies of the foreign exchange regime.      The model's treatment of&#13;
the import rationing scheme, and the efficiency losses that result from the&#13;
misallocation of resources that occurs ("rent-seeking") are described below.&#13;
The existence of substantial unsatisfied demand for foreign exchange&#13;
at the official exchange rate requires that the available supply be rationed&#13;
among users.    In the model,   two kinds of import rationing mechanisms are&#13;
assumed to operate.     First,  under fixprice or quantity rationing,      actual&#13;
sectoral imports are restricted to some fraction of desired imports.        These&#13;
imports are allocated to demanding sectors directly, with the importer paying&#13;
a price that reflects only the official exchange rate and tariff.      The impact&#13;
of this quantity rationing on each sector depends on the composition of its&#13;
imports and the extent of the quantitative restrictions applied to each&#13;
imported commodity.   Import users are rationed in the sense that they receive&#13;
fewer imports than they desire at the low (official) price; at the same time,&#13;
however, the firm is receiving an implicit rent by obtaining a scarce resource&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-12 -&#13;
at a lower price than it would be willing to pay for it.&#13;
The second rationing mechanism is a flexprice or premium rationing&#13;
scheme, in which enterprises that do not have access to sufficient foreign&#13;
exchange to meet their needs pay a premium over the official exchange rate to&#13;
obtain  the necessary   foreign  exchange.     This  flexprice  rationing  scheme&#13;
presupposes the existence of a functioning secondary market for foreign&#13;
exchange through which firms holding foreign exchange can sell it for a&#13;
premium above the existing official exchange rate.      The system is equivalent&#13;
to setting a uniform tariff on all imports just high enough to make the demand&#13;
for foreign exchange equal the supply.      The income flows generated by this&#13;
mechanism accrue to the firms that are initially allocated the foreign&#13;
exchange or are permitted to retain export earnings and therefore can sell&#13;
foreign exchange at a premium above the official exchange rate.&#13;
There is clearly a range of institutional arrangements that&#13;
constitute a continuum of possibilities for which quantity and premium&#13;
rationing represent polar cases. For example, a commonly observed arrangement&#13;
in Turkey is that foreign exchange is allocated directly to an enterprise for&#13;
its own use, but it is also allowed to import intermediate inputs for other&#13;
domestic enterprises who supply it with intermediate inputs.       Such a system&#13;
falls somewhere between pure quantity and uniform premium rationing.           To&#13;
capture this diversity, the model permits the simultaneous operation of the&#13;
two polar schemes, thus approximating a more realistic mix in practice. It is&#13;
important to stress, however, that the relative importance of fixprice versus&#13;
flexprice rationing over time must be specified exogenously, based upon&#13;
information on the evolution of the foreign exchange regime over the&#13;
particular period.&#13;
Regardless of the mix of quantity and premium rationing used, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-13 -&#13;
existence of unsatisfied demand for imports implies the existence of rents in&#13;
the system.   In the case of premium rationing, these rents are actual income&#13;
flows, corresponding to the income received by holders of foreign exchange&#13;
through its resale on the secondary market; for quantity rationing, no actual&#13;
income flow accrues to import users, but an implicit rent is generated in that&#13;
import users would be willing to pay more than the official price for the&#13;
limited quantity of imports they can obtain. The presence of such rents gives&#13;
rise to the possibility of inefficiency and waste as demanders of imports seek&#13;
to acquire   foreign  exchange  through  non-market   mechanisms.    Such "rent-&#13;
seeking" behavior has a real resource cost associated with it, as resources&#13;
that might otherwise be used in production are redirected to such activities&#13;
as lobbying for quantity allocations, negotiating complex agreements with&#13;
groups of enterprises for the distribution of foreign exchange, and the&#13;
like.   Even if actual rent-seeking behavior does not develop to the full&#13;
extent permitted by the existence of rents, it is of great interest to obtain&#13;
measures of the total rental income being generated by the overall system of&#13;
foreign exchange allocation.    Such measures reflect the degree of strain on&#13;
the allocation system arising from potential gains from rent-seeking.       These&#13;
strains include the possibility of illegal activities such as smuggling and&#13;
bribery which are likely to emerge as the magnitudes of rents arising from&#13;
efforts to ration foreign exchange get larger.&#13;
On the export side, there has traditionally existed in Turkey&#13;
substantial biases against exports, arising both from the persistent over-&#13;
valuation of the exchange rate over long periods of time, as well as the high&#13;
tariff barriers that have promoted import substitution at the expense of&#13;
export possibilities.   The 1980-81 policy reforms have made great progress in&#13;
reducing the bias against export expansion, both by the major devaluation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-14 -&#13;
the exchange rate that has been undertaken, as well as the adoption or&#13;
expansion of a variety of schemes designed to provide increased incentives to&#13;
current and potential exporters.    As a result of the increased complexity of&#13;
the export subsidy system, a number of different components of the overall&#13;
subsidy have been explicitly modeled in the current version of the model.&#13;
First, there continues to be a sectorally differentiated ad valorem&#13;
export subsidy paid to exporters out of government revenue.        Second, there&#13;
also exists another fixed subsidy component that is funded not by the&#13;
government but by non-exporters within a sector.      This subsidy, which can be&#13;
either positive or negative, captures the extent to which institutional&#13;
mechanisms exist within a sector to support (positive rates) or impede&#13;
(negative)  producers   from  selling  to   foreign  markets.    Third,  another&#13;
component of the total subsity is derived endogenously from the exemption of&#13;
exporters from the payment of tariffs on imported intermediate and investment&#13;
goods used subsequently for the production of export products.       The tariffs&#13;
owed on these imports by each exporting sector are calculated explicitly&#13;
within  the model,   and  turned  in  to an ad valorem rate      to allow   their&#13;
combination with other subsidy elements.      Since the tariffs on these goods&#13;
were never collected by the government, this subsidy component is modelled as&#13;
a payment out of capital income to exporters rather than as a fiscal subsidy&#13;
by the government. Fourth, another endogenous subsidy component representing&#13;
the government's rebate to firms of production taxes on goods produced for&#13;
export is explicitly calculated, and shows up as a government expenditure item&#13;
since it is an actual rebate on taxes paid.     Finally, the incentive effect of&#13;
the export earnings retention scheme is captured by calculating a subsidy&#13;
component equal to a certain percentage of the import premium rationing&#13;
rate.   For example, if the percentage is 10 percent of the premia rate, this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-15 -&#13;
corresponds to exporters being permitted to retain effective control over 10&#13;
percent of the foreign exchange they have earned, which can then be sold on&#13;
the secondary market, used for imports, or transferred to other firms in need&#13;
of foreign exchange.    This scheme permits exporters to capture some of the&#13;
rents associated with their earning foreign exchange, which partially&#13;
redresses the bias against exports that emerges from reliance on import&#13;
rationing schemes.    Note that in the extreme case of one hundred percent&#13;
retention, if there is a well functioning secondary market for foreign&#13;
exchange, the system is essentially equivalent to a flexible exchange rate&#13;
regime. However, since the scheme in Turkey permits less than full retention,&#13;
and the secondary market is not perfect, the net effect of the retention&#13;
scheme is to reduce, but not eliminate the bias against exports that emerges&#13;
from the rationing of imports.&#13;
B.2 Investment Allocation&#13;
One modification made in the current version of the Turkey CGE model&#13;
has been the programming of an explicit distinction between private and&#13;
government investment allocation patterns.    In earlier versions,   the pool of&#13;
total investment (fixed and inventory) had been allocated according to a&#13;
single set of sectoral investment allocation shares.     However, the desire to&#13;
focus more carefully on the impact of differing private sector responses to&#13;
the sizeable public sector investment program makes such an aggregate&#13;
specification undesirable.    The model now distinguishes between private and&#13;
government investment, and it is now feasible to test the impact of&#13;
alternative private investment scenarios, as well as to simulate the&#13;
economywide effect of a variety of public investment programs over the medium&#13;
term.&#13;
Behaviorally, the investment allocation scheme remains quite&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-16 -&#13;
simple. Rather than imposing a single sectoral allocation on both public and&#13;
private investment, two separate allocations are permitted, with the aggregate&#13;
allocation being determined endogenously as a linear combination of the two&#13;
allocations, with the weights corresponding to the shares of public and&#13;
private investment in total investment.&#13;
The endogeneity of the overall sectoral allocation of investment,&#13;
can be seen as depending on two distinct effects:          (i)   a shift in the&#13;
relative importance of the public and private sectors in total investment;&#13;
and   (ii) changes in the sectoral allocation of investment by either the&#13;
public or private sector.&#13;
With regard to the first effect, shifts in the public vs. private&#13;
balance in total investment can occur in a number of ways.         First, in the&#13;
simplest case when the model is savings-driven (total investment is set equal&#13;
to available savings), both the government and private actors (firms and&#13;
households) are saving according to exogenously specified savings rates.       If&#13;
government revenue should increase faster (slower) than the income base out of&#13;
which private actors save, the government's share of total investment should&#13;
increase (decrease) if the savings rates are held constant.&#13;
Second, when the model is investment-driven, the government is still&#13;
modeled as saving an exogenously fixed proportion of its total revenue.&#13;
However, in order to guarantee that the desired investment level is reached,&#13;
it is necessary to increase or decrease private savings to eliminate any&#13;
savings deficit or surplus.    Although one could conceivably make the savings&#13;
rates of all private actors (or only one) adjust to guarantee savings-&#13;
investment balance, for the current version of the model the institutional&#13;
(firm)   savings   rates   are   required   to  bear   the  adjustment   burden.&#13;
Consequently, if the share of investment in GDP is exogenously specified as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-17 -&#13;
rising in this investment-driven version, then the share of private in total&#13;
investment will also increase if the government savings rate remains constant,&#13;
and there is no substantial change in the ratio of government revenue to GDP.&#13;
Finally,   with   the   mixed   macro   closure   rule,    the  public&#13;
investment/GDP  ratio  is fixed,   so that   the government   savings  rate must&#13;
adjust; private actors are assumed to save according to exogenously fixed&#13;
savings   rates,   so  that   the   aggregate   investment/GDP   ration   remains&#13;
endogenous.   With this scenario, the public share of total investment will&#13;
increase if the public investment/GDP ratio rises, assuming no major changes&#13;
in the relative incomes of private actors in the economy.&#13;
The second effect represents a change in the sectoral mix of&#13;
investment by either the public or private sector. In the case of the public&#13;
sector, this corresponds to changes in the objectives of the public sector&#13;
investment program, and is readily captured by placing trends in the sectoral&#13;
public investment shares over time.    In the private sector, the intersectoral&#13;
pattern of investment over time can be specified exogenously as well, or the&#13;
operation of market forces can be simulated by permitting private investment&#13;
allocation to respond to changes in sectoral rental rates.&#13;
While the modifications presented above permit a much more detailed&#13;
examination of alternative investment allocation scenarios, it is important to&#13;
note that the model still fails to treat several important features central to&#13;
the savings-investment   balance  in developing countries.      First,  and most&#13;
important, there is still no treatment of the financial sector in the model,&#13;
so that the role of interest rates and asset markets in eliciting savings and&#13;
facilitating  investment  are completely omitted.      Second,  the model still&#13;
contains a relatively crude portrayal of the public sector deficit.           For&#13;
investment allocation, what is important is the public and private shares in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-18 -&#13;
total investment; however, in the model, these are assumed to be the public&#13;
and private shares in total savings as well.     The private and public sectors&#13;
are each modeled as investing all that they save; if the government in reality&#13;
borrows from the private sector to finance its own investment program, either&#13;
via bond markets or inflationary monetary policy, this must be captured within&#13;
the model by including this flow of resources in government revenue from&#13;
taxation of the private sector.&#13;
B.3 Production Technology&#13;
Most multisector CGE models have relied on a Leontief fixed input&#13;
coefficients specification with regard to input requirements. Over a planning&#13;
period as long as a decade, where significant relative price changes may occur&#13;
or where the government may implement policies designed to induce changes in&#13;
the input mix, this specification is inadequate for capturing the dynamic&#13;
responses of the economy.     To begin to allow for the possibility of some&#13;
price-sensitive, endogenous input response to changing market conditions, the&#13;
current version of the CGE model includes two separate substitution processes.&#13;
The first process addresses the massive increase in the relative&#13;
price of petroleum in the last decade, which should over time lead to&#13;
substantial substitution of other fuels, especially lignite, for imported&#13;
crude and refined petroleum.     In light of the Turkish government's stated&#13;
intention to invest heavily in the domestic production of coal and to&#13;
encourage petroleum conservation, and the dominant share of petroleum and&#13;
petroleum products in total imports, it becomes critically important to&#13;
simulate this substitution possibility within the model.&#13;
This has been done by defining a sectoral aggregate "energy" input&#13;
coefficient, which is a CES aggregation of the base year coal and petroleum&#13;
input coefficients in each sector.     In subsequent periods, as the relative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-19 -&#13;
prices of the two energy inputs diverge, substitution between the two&#13;
alternative energy inputs is permitted according to sectoral substitution&#13;
elasticities, subject to the constraint that the aggregate energy input&#13;
coefficient   remain  constant.      The   use  of   sectorally   differentiated&#13;
elasticities is an acknowledgement that certain production technologies (e.g.&#13;
electricity generation) present greater substitution possibilities than&#13;
others.&#13;
The second substitution process addresses the fact that with fixed&#13;
physical input coefficients in production, there can be no substitution&#13;
between intermediate material inputs and primary factors of production (labor&#13;
and capital). As a result, if aggregate intermediate input prices should rise&#13;
relative to labor and capital, the share of intermediate costs in total costs&#13;
will rise as well.    While this simplification may be adequate for the short&#13;
run, in the medium to long term some substitution between material inputs and&#13;
value added is to be expected.&#13;
To capture this phenomenon, the modeling of the production&#13;
activities in the model has been generalized to incorporate some degree of&#13;
substitution between physical inputs on the one hand and capital and labor on&#13;
the other. If one leaves the input coefficients unchanged, as in the earlier&#13;
version of the model, the share of intermediate costs in total costs is&#13;
determined endogenously as a result of changes in the prices of these&#13;
inputs. An alternative specification is now included in which the value share&#13;
of intermediate costs is held constant; in other words, if intermediate input&#13;
prices rise ten percent relative to other prices, the physical input&#13;
coefficients will be lowered by ten percent so that the share of intermediate&#13;
in total costs remains unchanged.    This specification assumes a Cobb-Douglas&#13;
production function in aggregate intermediate inputs and primary factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-20 -&#13;
Since neither the traditional fixed physical coefficients nor the fixed value&#13;
shares of the Cobb-Douglas version are realistic, a range of intermediate&#13;
cases is also possible in which, in response to a rise in intermediate input&#13;
costs, some exogenously determined portion of. the increase may be offset by&#13;
reducing physical input coefficients (e.g. conservation, more factor intensive&#13;
production techniques), but the remainder must be passed through as an&#13;
increase in the share of intermediate input costs, thereby lowering returns to&#13;
the primary factors of production.&#13;
C. Mathematical Presentation of the CGE Model&#13;
In this section, we present a more formal mathematical description&#13;
of the static, within-period,    CGE model of Turkey.      We first present the&#13;
equations of the flexible exchange rate version of the model, and then discuss&#13;
the adjustments that must be made to the equations to accomodate fixprice and&#13;
flexprice import rationing schemes under a fixed exchange rate regime.&#13;
C.1 Equations of the Flexible Exchange Rate Model&#13;
Endogenous variables are denoted by capital letters without a bar.&#13;
Lower case letters, Greek letters, and letters with a bar are exogenous&#13;
variables  or parameters.     The  subscripts  i and   j refer to sectors,    the&#13;
subscript k refers to labor categories, and the subscript g refers to consumer&#13;
groups. There are n sectors, m labor categories, and g consumer groups. Non-&#13;
linear functions are not written out explicitly.      Instead, the symbol for a&#13;
function f(-) is used and the form of the particular function is explained&#13;
with each such equation.&#13;
The income and flow-of-funds equations are not explicitly written&#13;
out. In terms of the mathematics of the model, they serve to distribute total&#13;
value   added  to   the  various   institutions   (enterprises,  households   and&#13;
government), determine the split between savings and consumption, and ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-21 -&#13;
that each economic actor--and the system as a whole--satisfies a budget&#13;
constraint.   These relationships are discussed in the first section of this&#13;
appendix and repeating the presentation here would only complicate the&#13;
notation of the model, without adding any substance.&#13;

f(-)     equation (3), cost function dual of the CES trade aggregation&#13;

In the model, imports and domestic goods are assumed to be imperfect&#13;
substitutes. Consumers demand a composite good which is a CES aggregation of&#13;
imports and domestic goods, with a different trade aggregation function for&#13;
each sector.    This specification implies that the price of imports need not&#13;
equal the price of domestic goods (PMi # PDi) and that the domestic price&#13;
system acquires a large degree of autonomy not present in standard trade&#13;
models  in which world     prices  determine  domestic  prices.    Assuming   that&#13;
consumers desire to minimize the cost of acquiring a given amount of the&#13;
composite good, the resulting first-order conditions can be solved to yield a&#13;
cost function for the composite good, equation (3).         Given that the trade&#13;
aggregation function is linearly homogeneous, this cost function depends only&#13;
on prices.&#13;

function,&#13;
f(-)  :   equation (8), Cobb-Douglas or CES labor aggregation function.&#13;
The production function in most sectors is simply a Cobb-Douglas or&#13;
CES function of labor and capital.   Intermediate input requirements are given&#13;
by fixed input-output coefficients, so equations (9), (11) and (12) are not&#13;
needed. However, the model also permits a three-level specification in which,&#13;
at the first level, aggregate labor is a CES aggregation of labor of different&#13;
categories, and aggregate capital and intermediate inputs are fixed&#13;
coefficients aggregates.   As noted earlier, the aggregate intermediate energy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-24 -&#13;
input is a CES aggregation of the coal and petroleum intermediate input&#13;
coefficients. At the second level, aggregate value added is a Cobb-Douglas or&#13;
a CES aggregation of aggregate capital and labor.    Finally, output is a Cobb-&#13;
Douglas function of aggregate value added and aggregate intermediate inputs.&#13;
The various   specifications  allow a great    deal of flexibility within the&#13;
general framework of smooth, neoclassical production functions.&#13;
Equations (10), (11) and (12) represent the conditions that factor&#13;
returns equal marginal value products for all inputs.       Given fixed capital&#13;
stocks by sectors, the market rentals WKi are assumed to differ by sectors.&#13;
For labor, the wage is assumed to adjust so that the demand for labor equals&#13;
the supply, and the excess demand equation (15) is satisfied for each category&#13;
of labor.   The demand for intermediate inputs is also solved endogenously so&#13;
that the cost of the intermediate-input aggregate for each sector equals its&#13;
marginal revenue product--equation (12).      For the sectors in which input-&#13;
output coefficients are fixed, this equation is not needed.&#13;

The CGE model permits a variety of specifications of export&#13;
behavior.   In the base runs with the Turkey model, sectoral exports are set&#13;
exogenously   which   implies   that   in   equation   (16)  the   export   share&#13;
parameters Se are set to achieve the target exports.      In other runs with of&#13;
i&#13;
the model, the share parameters are determined behaviorally.        They reflect&#13;
export supply behavior and can be specified as functions of the relative price&#13;
of exports to domestic sales, PE/PD.&#13;
In the model, the export and domestic markets are segmented. Thus,&#13;
there is no requirement that PE = PD in any sector.         If they deviate, it&#13;
implies that there is a wedge in incentives between the two markets.       Such a&#13;
wedge is inconsistent with the usual neoclassical assumption that producers&#13;
must reach a point where they are indifferent between selling on the export or&#13;
domestic  markets.     Given   institutional  rigidities   and  difficulties   in&#13;
"breaking into" export markets, the assumption of segmented markets is&#13;
probably reasonable.    However, if forward runs of the model yield diverging&#13;
values of PD and PE for various sectors over time, then one must question the&#13;
validity of the underlying specification of export behavior.      In the runs of&#13;
the model using exogenously specified exports, the time paths of PD and PE&#13;
were examined as a check on the viability of the export targets.&#13;

The Operation of Markets&#13;
There are three types of markets in the model; those for labor,&#13;
output, and foreign exchange.     The model assumes that these three sets of&#13;
markets all "clear" which means that the excess-demand equations for labor&#13;
(15), output (35), and foreign exchange (18) must all equal zero at&#13;
equilibrium.   Indeed, the solution problem is to find a set of wages (Wk),&#13;
product prices (PDi) and an exchange rate (ER) such that the three sets of&#13;
excess-demand equations are simultaneously satisfied.L/&#13;
Counting, there are 20.n + 2.m + 2.g + 2.n.n. + m.n + g.n + 6&#13;
endogenous variables.   Note that the number of equations is one greater than&#13;
the  number  of  endogenous variables.     The  system  is a Walrasian    general&#13;
equilibrium system in which the excess-demand equations must satisfy Walras'&#13;
Law and, hence, are not independent.     The system can only determine relative&#13;
prices, and the price normalization equation (6) is required to set the&#13;
absolute price level.&#13;

(1982).&#13;

C.2 Fixed Exchange Rates and Import Rationing&#13;
If one assumes that the exchange rate is fixed, then some other&#13;
mechanism must be specified to satisfy the balance of payments equation (18).&#13;
One simple approach used in many planning models is simply to make the net&#13;
inflow of foreign exchange F endogenous. Such an assumption is not reasonable&#13;
for a country such as Turkey, and alternative adjustment mechanisms must be&#13;
specified.   Under a premium or flexprice rationing scheme, a new endogenous&#13;
variable is introduced; the premium rate. Equation (1) is replaced by:&#13;
(la)  PMi   =    PW   (1 + tmi + PR) ER&#13;
The premium rate PR is determined endogenously so as to satisfy the balance of&#13;
payments equation (18). The resulting premium income (EPWiMi.PR.ER) must also&#13;
be taken into account in the income and flow-of-funds equations (as discussed&#13;
in the previous appendix).&#13;
Tinder quantitative or fixprice rationing, the situation is a more&#13;
complicated. In this version, the desired ratio of imports to domestic demand&#13;
given by equation (17) is assumed not to hold. Instead, demanders are assumed&#13;
to be limited to some fraction of their desired ratio, and this fraction is&#13;
determined endogenously in order to satisfy the balance of payments equation&#13;
(18).   Demanders of imports are assumed to be off their demand curves and&#13;
equation (17) is replaced by:&#13;
(17a)       Mi/Di = RM f(PDi/PMi)&#13;
where RM is the endogenous quantity rationing rate.&#13;
Note that in this situation, the cost function dual to the trade&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-29 -&#13;
aggregation function, equation (3), no longer holds.11       The composite price&#13;
equation can be redefined using the identity that the total value of composite&#13;
goods must equal the value of imports and domestic goods:       Pi Qi = PMi Mi +&#13;
PDi Di, where Qi - f(Mi,Di) is the CES trade aggregation function.        In this&#13;
case, the composite price equation becomes:&#13;
PDi + PMi (Mi/Di)&#13;
(3a)  Pi    '        f(Mi/Di, 1)&#13;
where f(Mi/Di,l) is the trade aggregation function evaluated at (Mi/Di,l).&#13;
Equation (3a) is valid whether or not users of imports are on their demand&#13;
curves.&#13;
When both fixprice and flexprice import rationing are assumed to be&#13;
operating simultaneously, then the quantitative rationing fraction is set&#13;
exogenously and the premium rate PR is solved endogenously.         The quantity&#13;
rationing is thus applied on top of the premium rationing, since the desired&#13;
ratio of imports to domestic goods M/D is a function of the premium-ridden&#13;
price, PM. In this case, both equations (la) and (3a) must be used.&#13;
1/    Equation (33) must also be adjusted.     See Dervis, de Melo and Robinson&#13;
(1982) for further discussion.&#13;

Appendix II: The Data in the Turkey CGE Model&#13;
The process of compiling the necessary data and fitting it into the&#13;
CGE model framework remains a painstaking one.     The process can be viewed as&#13;
consisting of two separate stages: first, obtaining the best, most-up-to-date&#13;
data and information on the base year, plus information on actual trends for&#13;
dynamic applications; and second, using the data to estimate the parameters of&#13;
the model.   The first stage requires insuring accounting consistency among&#13;
data obtained from a variety of sources and the second stage involves&#13;
"calibration" of the model so that, given the data that is being supplied, the&#13;
model captures the important characteristics of the period under study.&#13;
In working with the base year data, the process of generating&#13;
consistent data and estimating structural parameters was greatly expedited&#13;
through the use of the social accounting matrix (SAM) generator program that&#13;
has been developed at the World Bank.     Through the use of this program, the&#13;
tedious process of adjusting and readjusting different variables to achieve&#13;
accounting consistency is simplified and automated.     At the same time, using&#13;
base data as a point estimate, the program also generates values of all of the&#13;
structural parameters needed by the CGE model so that the data that emerge&#13;
from the process represent an equilibrium solution in the first year.&#13;
Calibration of the dynamic model involves a more informal procedure of&#13;
adjusting various structural parameters over time so that the model "tracks"&#13;
the economic trends of the period.     This is necessary because there are not&#13;
enough time series data to support formal econometric estimation of all the&#13;
structural parameters of the intertemporal models, so one must rely heavily on&#13;
extraneous estimates.&#13;
The major data source used in the construction of the 1978 data set&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-31 -&#13;
was  the  15 sector   input-output  tables  estimated  for  1978 by Celasun ./&#13;
Starting from the 64 sector 1973 input-output table prepared by the State&#13;
Institute of Statistics (SIS) in Turkey for use in preparing the Fourth Five&#13;
Year Plan (1973-1978), Celasun has produced a provisional 15 sector set of&#13;
input-output accounts that have been reconciled with available national income&#13;
accounts. While this work provided the underlying accounts necessary for the&#13;
CGE model's application, additional data on government and capital flow-of-&#13;
funds had to be obtained from various Turkish sources.&#13;
One problem that remains in utilizing data from these distinct data&#13;
sources is the reconciliation of differing sectoral aggregation schemes.&#13;
Tables II-1 and II-2 show how the 13 sector scheme adopted for use in the CGE&#13;
model can be reconciled with the 10 sector scheme used by the Turkish State&#13;
Planning Organization (SPO) as well as with the 15 sector scheme used by&#13;
Celasun in estimating the 1978 input-output table. In the far right of Table&#13;
II-1 the mapping from the official 64-sector SIS classification is shown. As&#13;
can be seen in Table II-2, difficulties arise because the SPO aggregation&#13;
scheme contains no disaggregation for the manufacturing sectors that are the&#13;
primary emphasis of the CGE model.&#13;
Several features of the 13 sector aggregation scheme chosen are&#13;
worth noting.   The petroleum sector is vertically integrated, incorporaating&#13;
petroleum extraction, refining, and petroleum products.     In conjunction with&#13;
the separation of coal mining from other mining, this facilitates explicit&#13;
focus on the substitution possibilities between coal and petroleum products.&#13;
The food processing sector includes many processed agricultural products (such&#13;
as cotton and tobacco) that in other Turkish accounts are included as part of&#13;
1/ Celasun (1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- A-32 -&#13;
the agriculture sector, so that export and production figures for these two&#13;
sectors must   be  interpreted  with  caution.    Housing  and  public   services&#13;
includes the full range of government public services such as health,&#13;
education and housing, and is a non-traded sector.&#13;
A number of adjustments were made to the 1978 data base, so the&#13;
accounts are not identified to the input-output accounts prepared by&#13;
Celasun. First, trade flows have been reestimated based on revised government&#13;
figures on the dollar value of imports and exports. Second, we have adopted a&#13;
slightly lower average exchange rate for 1978 than that used by Celasun (24.3&#13;
vs. 25.0 Turkish lira per dollar).       Third, Celasun's estimated trade and&#13;
transportation margins for exported goods have not been used, since the CGE&#13;

Finally, we have chosen not to adopt the adjustments to the official aggregate&#13;
consumption and investment figures that Celasun made, since we want to match&#13;
official government national income statistics as closely as possible.&#13;
Data on investment shares have been adapted from the Public Sector&#13;
Investment Review undertaken by the World Bank,     supplemented by information&#13;
on private investment in manufacturing from Turkish sources.i/         Aggregate&#13;
employment data from the SPO has been supplemented by the sectoral detail in&#13;
Celasun's and in the earlier modeling work by Dervis and Robinson, which was&#13;
also the basic source for the capital stock data and the shares of capital and&#13;
labor in value added.&#13;
The elasticities of substitution between capital and labor and&#13;
domestic and imported goods have not been estimated econometrically, but&#13;
instead represent guesses of these values based on informal evidence from&#13;
Turkey and other countries.&#13;
Tables II-3 to II-6 summarize 1978 base data used in the model,&#13;
including the input-output coefficients matrix, the capital coefficients&#13;
matrix, the structure of output, final demand, value added, labor, and&#13;
capital, and various trade and production data and parameters.       Table II-7&#13;
shows the overall flow of funds in the economy as portrayed in a social&#13;
accounting matrix for 1978, while Table II-8 has the sectoral material balance&#13;
flows.   Table 11-9 contains the country data used in Section 3 to compare&#13;
Turkey to a sample of other middle income countries.&#13;

            Turkey : recent economic performance and
            medium-term prospects, 1978-1990
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            By 1978, Turkey was in the midst of the
            most serious foreign exchange and economic crisis it had
            experienced in three decades. This paper presents an
            analysis of the 1978-80 crisis period in Turkey and an
            exploration of the feasibility and sustainability of the
            ongoing export-led recovery. A computable general
            equilibrium model of the Turkish economy attempts to capture
            the basic features of the 1978-81 foreign exchange
            disequilibrium in Turkey and evaluate their role in the
            crisis through a series of historical simulations. The model
            is then used to undertake a series of forward runs for the
            1982-90 period which reflect alternative scenarios as to the
            success and viability of the ongoing shift in Turkish
            development policy from inward-looking import substitution
            to outward-focused export expansion. An overview of the
            model is included in the body of the paper, while Appendix I
            contains a detailed description and algebraic summary.
            Appendix II outlines the data sources used for the study.
