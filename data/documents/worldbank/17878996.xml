&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
                      MR. LEDUC:   :r.~r.   Chairman, members of the Board,&#13;
&#13;
           the education project before you is of critical importance&#13;
&#13;
           to the economy of the People's Republic of the Congo.         Indeed,&#13;
&#13;
           more than in most African countries, the needs for reform of&#13;
&#13;
           the education system is particularly acute and pressing.&#13;
&#13;
           Until 1960, Brazzaville was the administrative center for&#13;
&#13;
           the entire region kno"m as French Equatorial Africa, and&#13;
&#13;
           today composed of four countries -- the Congo, the Central&#13;
&#13;
           African Republic, Chad and Gabon.&#13;
&#13;
                      Even after these countries gained their independence,&#13;
&#13;
            the Congo's administrative organization continued to gr0\-1,&#13;
&#13;
            in spite of efforts to halt this trend.        Urban population&#13;
&#13;
            has also grown considerably and is now about 40 percent of&#13;
&#13;
            the country's total population.&#13;
&#13;
                      As a result of these factors, the education system&#13;
&#13;
            is well developed and relatively advanced.        However, its&#13;
&#13;
            output mainly consists of generalists only with a marked lack&#13;
&#13;
            of specialists and technicians.&#13;
&#13;
                      The project before you helps fill this gap.        It is&#13;
&#13;
            also a first step for reorienting the system toward meeting&#13;
&#13;
            the needs of the economy.        Because of the geography of the&#13;
&#13;
            region, Congo has always supplied the transit services for th&#13;
&#13;
            external trade of Chad, the Central African Republic and&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL                                                9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            parts of Gabon and Cameroon.   The River, roads and railway&#13;
&#13;
            system terminates at Pointe Noire in the Congo, the region's&#13;
&#13;
            only seaport.&#13;
&#13;
                      As a result of this transit system, the Congo's&#13;
&#13;
            economy is service oriented and its role as an interregional&#13;
&#13;
            transport center is its dominant feature.     Services including&#13;
&#13;
            government account for about half of the GDP.    Transport is&#13;
&#13;
            a major bottleneck to economic development.     Improvement of&#13;
&#13;
            the railroad is a precondition to the effective use of&#13;
&#13;
            Congo's resources, particularly in forestry.    Consequently,&#13;
&#13;
            our proposed operation concentrates on helping meet these&#13;
&#13;
            transportation requirements.&#13;
&#13;
                      Large public investments have been made in recent&#13;
&#13;
            years in manufacturing which now comprises about 15 percent&#13;
&#13;
            of GDP.   The manufacturing sector is currently experiencing&#13;
&#13;
            some operational and financial difficulties due to the enforc d&#13;
&#13;
            infiltration of competing plants in neighboring countries,&#13;
&#13;
            investments in some marginal enterprises and the lack of&#13;
&#13;
            adequate management and skilled personnel.&#13;
&#13;
                       The Government is very much concerned about the&#13;
&#13;
            need for improved management and high quality middle level&#13;
&#13;
            manpower which is required to secure proper operation of&#13;
&#13;
            existing plants and to assure the implementation of investmen s&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           planned for the future.     The proposed project addresses itself&#13;
&#13;
           to these needs as wel J as to other manpo\'7er shortages in the&#13;
&#13;
           economy.&#13;
&#13;
                      The Congo's agriculture is mainly of a subsistence&#13;
&#13;
           nature, except for forestry exploitation, sugar and cocoa&#13;
&#13;
           production.   Only forestry and the sugar industry have&#13;
&#13;
           contributed significantly to export earnings.        Domestic food&#13;
&#13;
           production has not been able to keep up with local demand.&#13;
&#13;
                      To improve this situation, better agricultural&#13;
&#13;
           techniques need to be developed among small farmers who should&#13;
&#13;
           also be supplied with adequate marketing services.        The&#13;
&#13;
           project will reduce the manpower shortage in important&#13;
&#13;
           economic sectors, improve the quality of primary and secondary&#13;
&#13;
           education, and therefore contribute significantly to the&#13;
&#13;
           economic development of the country.&#13;

                      Gentlemen, may I have your questions?&#13;
&#13;
                      Yes, Hr. Rota.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. ROTA:    Thank you, r-1r. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                      I am very much in favor of this project because it&#13;
&#13;
           touches one of the fundamental needs of a developing country.&#13;
&#13;
            So I have no particular observations.     There is only one poin&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL                                                        11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           that has left me a little surprised about local expenses.&#13;
&#13;
                        First of all, there is not really an explicit&#13;
&#13;
           justification for it, although it is implicit that local&#13;
&#13;
           entrepreneurs will probably be winning the business, et cetera&#13;
&#13;
           et cetera.      But, furthermore, if we compare pages 3 and 5 of&#13;
&#13;
           your report, I see two percentages which are contrasting&#13;
&#13;
           really.&#13;
&#13;
                        On page 3 it says that 71 percent of the credit&#13;
&#13;
           will finance the foreign exchange components of the credit.&#13;
&#13;
           The remaining $1 million, or 29 percent of the credit,. would&#13;
&#13;
           finance local expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
                        On page 5 at the end of paragraph 19 you see that&#13;
&#13;
           financing by IDA of 62 percent of the local expenditures on&#13;
&#13;
           this project is justified.             I imagine it's a slip because betw en&#13;
&#13;
           29 percent and 62 --&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McNAMARA :      No.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. ROTA:      It says of IDA credit.&#13;
&#13;
                        ~-iR.   McNAMARA:   No, it's a different base.&#13;
&#13;
                        Mr. Leduc, perhaps you would explain it.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. ROTA:      I have not been able to find the differen&#13;
&#13;
           basis.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. LEDUC:      The amount of , let's call it $1 million&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL                                                       12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           is 29 percent of the credit.        This 29 percent of the credit&#13;
&#13;
           "t-lill finance 62 percent of the amount of local expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. McNAMARA:    You might look at the bottom of&#13;
&#13;
           page 3, Hr. Rota, and the foreign exchange components is&#13;
&#13;
           $2.5 or $4.1, the difference of local expenditure being&#13;
&#13;
           $1.6.   And the one million dollars difference between two&#13;
&#13;
           and a half and three and a half is 62 percent of 1.6.        It's&#13;
&#13;
           a different base.     It's rather confusing the tt-Tay we have&#13;
&#13;
           expressed it.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. ROTA;     I understand now, but it is not very clea .&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McNAMARA:     It is not.     You are quite right.&#13;
&#13;
                     Ma. ROTA:    There was some misunderstandinq.&#13;

&#13;
           to this project.     I think it probably is not absolutely the&#13;

&#13;
           60 percent of the population lives on aqriculture and&#13;

           forestry as is stated in the document and the project seems&#13;
&#13;
           to provide in, say, ten years only mechanics, office workers,&#13;
&#13;
           and other urban professionals, but no skilled workers for the&#13;
&#13;
           arms or foresters.     In fact, the economic memo clearly&#13;
&#13;
           indicates that what the Conqo needs is more tax revenues from&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     HR. CHAUFOURNIER:    All I can add is that the&#13;
&#13;
           Government of the Congo doesn't have at the present time a&#13;
&#13;
           development program.   It is working on a development program.&#13;
&#13;
           We have our Economic Mission which was in the field at the&#13;
&#13;
           time when the program was being developed and has already&#13;
&#13;
           commented on the program and is going to comment in discussing&#13;
&#13;
           its conclusions with the Congolese Government.     We have not&#13;
&#13;
           finalized our conclusions, but they are clearly going in the&#13;
&#13;
           direction that you have indicated.    '.Ve in fact see limited&#13;
&#13;
           possibility for increasing public savings, increasing&#13;
&#13;
           revenues which are already high, a proportion of 25 percent&#13;
&#13;
           of current revenues representing 25 percent of GDP.      But if&#13;
&#13;
           there is an area where there is a possibility of increase,&#13;
&#13;
           it's perhaps in reviewing the present status of concession&#13;
&#13;
           in the forestry industry.&#13;
&#13;
                     Now, this is a difficult matter.      We have not been&#13;
&#13;
           able to give assistance to the Congolese Government at this&#13;
&#13;
           time essentially because of staff limitation, but this is an&#13;
&#13;
           area we propose to look into as we are doing in the general&#13;
&#13;
           area where it is a particular problem for countries like&#13;
&#13;
           Gabon, Brazzaville and the Cameroon as well.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McNM1ARA:     Thank you, Roger.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY C NFIDENTIAL                                                   15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    We will consider the project approved.&#13;
&#13;
                    Mr. Kochman, do you wish to comment?&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. KOCHMAN:     Well, Mr. Chairman, I would like&#13;

&#13;
                     Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having presented to&#13;

            Partial Transcript of meeting of the
            Executive Directors of the IBRD and IDA, held on Tuesday,
            March 16, 1971 : Republic of Congo - Education Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This partial transcript concerns a joint
            meeting between the International Bank for Reconstruction
            and Development (IBRD) and the International Development
            Association (IDA) over a credit for an education project in
            the Republic of Congo. Urban population in the country grew
            considerably during the 1960s to about forty (40) percent of
            the total population. As a result the education system was
            well developed and relatively advanced; however, its output
            lacked specialists and technicians. This education project
            will reduce the urban workforce shortage in important
            economic sectors like transportation and manufacturing and
            improve the quality of primary and secondary education. The
            country&#146;s interregional transport center accounts for about
            fifty (50) percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and
            manufacturing services account for about fifteen (15)
            percent of the GDP. The government of the Republic of Congo
            is concerned about skilled personnel to secure proper
            operation of existing infrastructure, as well as assure the
            implementation of planned investments in the future. This
            education project does not involve the sixty (60) percent of
            the population that subsides on agriculture, working in
            forestry, a sector that provides tax incentive to the government.
