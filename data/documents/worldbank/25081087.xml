ï»¿The Journe&#13;
Y&#13;
At the turn of the 21 sl century, Sri Lanka continued to be gripped by a civil conflict that had tu&#13;
violent several decades earlier and impeded growth in all sectors of the economy. The Road SE&#13;
Assistance Project (RSAP) was a decade-long journey that began in 2005, when a ceasefire w&#13;
effect, to revitalize the country's soclo-economic development, The directions taken and&#13;
destinations reached by RSAP were path breaking. The achievements were particularly remark&#13;
since the project had to contend with a failed ceasefire and renewed hostility for several years&#13;
implementation.&#13;
The focus of RSAP was the national road network, which carried 70% of the country's traffic. It&#13;
here that the most immediate and pressing needs had to be addressed to enable better connec&#13;
between the regions, provide better access to markets and services, and drive towards po,&#13;
reduction, The project aimed to lower transportation costs through the sustainable delivery c&#13;
efficient national road system that serves the needs of road users and the Sri Lankan public at Ic&#13;
It also sought to close the gap between the government's planned reforms and the institut&#13;
capacity on the ground to implement them, RSAP prioritized the rehabilitation of roads in (&#13;
provinces - a process that increased, in parallel, the capacity of the Road Development Autl&#13;
(RDA). Equally importantly, the project enabled private sector participation and accelerated&#13;
development of the local construction industry,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿In addition to the national highways, RSAP rehabilitated rural roads in nine local government areas as  oriented one. The RDA has begun undertaking road safety audits, user satisfaction surveys and&#13;
a pilot initiative, building capacity within local authorities and establishing a framework for developing  technical audits. The organization has also developed its design units and improved supervision&#13;
institutional capabilities for road infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance within a decentralized  capacity.&#13;
governance system.&#13;
Moreover, RSAP has been supporting the RDA to establish a fully-fledged asset management system&#13;
Another related achievement was the creation of a comprehensive rural roads database for the entire  to inventorize, prioritize, monitor and manage its network with a view to increasing the organization's&#13;

which represents nearly 75% of the country's total road network.                  road rehabilitation program will be managed wisely and provide the road users with a level of service&#13;
that they would demand.&#13;
RSAP was instrumental in reinforcing the concept of environmental and social safeguards - to&#13;
minimize negative impacts on the environment and on people - in road sector projects. The RDA and&#13;
the construction companies improved their proficiency to implement safeguards and manage&#13;
safeguard issues while putting in place the systems and procedures that were needed to&#13;
institutionalize these practices.&#13;
"I think this was the beginning of a revolution in the road sector It was with RSAP that&#13;
Among the many innovations introduced by RSAP was the piloting of the concept of benefit  road designs began to adopt a futuristic outlook. Earlier we were simply managing the&#13;
monitoring - to examine the process of road construction and rehabilitation from the perspective of  needs of the sector as we went along in the best way we could. Things changed with&#13;

and constructed with wide stakeholder consultation in close collaboration with the University of&#13;
Moratuwa, has proved its potential for wider replication.&#13;
The achievements of RSAP have gone beyond infrastructure development. It has catalyzed reform in&#13;
the sector, facilitating the transition of the RDA from an infrastructure oriented organisation to a service&#13;

I k, a&#13;
It is difficult to imagine a dynamic economy without a good road network The road network is one of&#13;
the most important features of a country's infrastructure and one of its most valuable assets&#13;
Economic growth, land use patterns, housing, and social interactions depend on - and are inseparable&#13;
from - a country's roads Roads connect people to work, education, services - and other people It&#13;
enables the supply of goods, the operation of trade, and the generation of knowledge. Improving roads&#13;
is therefore key to reducing poverty and creating a more equitable society, In contrast, the lack of good&#13;
roads results in marginalization and backwardness - both economic and social&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿When the World Bank studied Sri Lanka's road sector in 2004, the country had seen an average road  Road sector maintenance costs&#13;
traffic growth rate of 6% for four years. This was despite the fact that a situation of conflict and&#13;
violence had prevailed in many parts of the country for over two decades. However, the road network  Sri Lanka has a land area of 65,610 km2 and the highest road density in South Asia. In 2004, the&#13;
was in a state of disrepair and deterioration, due to inadequate maintenance at all levels - national,  country had a road network of 92,700 km, comprising 11,600 km of national highways, 16,500 km&#13;

Not only were more than half the national roads in poor condition, many of them were also seriously  The total funding requirement for periodic and routine maintenance of roads from 2007 to 2013 was&#13;
congested. Road congestion compelled the government to increase road capacity, which requires  approximately Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) 81 billion, but only LKR 38 billion was made available during&#13;

around because the responsibility for rural roads had been decentralized to local government  Development partners grew concerned that if a proper mechanism was not set up for maintenance,&#13;
authorities without strengthening their technical and financial capacities.          the sustainability of their support would be undermined. This situation was compounded by&#13;
inadequate institutional capacity in the road sector. Sri Lanka needed considerable investment to&#13;
address the road rehabilitation backlog, and to bring its road system to a level of performance and&#13;
reliability consistent with the country's development objectives.&#13;
Road sector institutions&#13;
The Ministry of Highways2 is responsible for policies and programs related to the national road&#13;
network, and the Road Development Authority (RDA), a statutory institution under the Ministry, has the&#13;
task of planning and maintaining the national highway network, and planning, designing and building&#13;
new roads, bridges and expressways to augment the existing network. Provincial Councils are&#13;
responsible for provincial roads and the local authorities (including municipal councils, urban councils&#13;
and pradeshiya sabhas) for rural roads.&#13;

In 2004, GOSL sought the World Bank's re-engagement in the country's road sector after a lapse of&#13;
over a decade. The Government's development strategy, which highlighted the urgent need to&#13;
develop its roads and increase interaction between provinces, coincided with the Bank's assistance&#13;
strategy that supported investment in roads as an essential infrastructure development area for&#13;
pro-poor growth linked to shared prosperity Moreover, both strategies emphasized the importance of&#13;
developing private industry for road construction and maintenance, Thus, the World Bank's renewed&#13;
partnership with GOSL was based on shared objectives and the benefit of the experience of previous&#13;
collaborations.&#13;
In November 2004, the World Bank, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the&#13;
Asian Development Bank (ADB) decided to coordinate their activities in the road sector within the&#13;
context of the reform framework, The World Bank took the leadership in addressing the issue of&#13;
sustainable road maintenance financing, JICA took forward the subject of private sector development&#13;
in the road construction industry and the ADB continued to take the lead in institutional building and&#13;
capacity building at the RDA,&#13;

RSAP got off the ground in a climate of change and innovation in Sri Lanka's road sector, The project&#13;
was expected to help maintain the momentum of the road sector reforms that were being introduced.&#13;
Key to achieving RSAP's targets - arriving at the journey's destinations - would be improved capacity&#13;
within the RDA, the agency responsible for steering the project. This was a process that began from&#13;
the preparatory stages, reaching several significant milestones as the project progressed.&#13;

ï»¿"We conducted training sessions for Government officials in the sector on how to&#13;

The fast track&#13;
At the beginning of the project, a pressing chalenge was to complete the procurements for the RSAP  The Bank was also responsive to the Government's request to use the standard bidding document&#13;
road packages within a strict timeline. The mobilization of consultants, the invitation of bids, and the  of the Institute of Construction Training and Development (ICTAD), as the contractors were familiar with&#13;
evaluation of bids had to be done in quick succession.                            it. This enhanced the understanding of the contract that helped move the procurement process.&#13;

ï»¿Break ng Ground&#13;
One of the most significant achievements of RSAP is that it has enabled the road sector in Sri Lanka&#13;
to develop its all-round capacity for progress and sustainability. The World Bank's close collaboration&#13;
with the RDA generated innovative and practical solutions to addressing a range of challenges.&#13;
Crucially, most of these approaches, based on clearly defined principles, are being incorporated and&#13;
institutionalized to enable the long-term development of the sector,&#13;
Setting up a fund for road maintenance&#13;
A vital initiative supported by RSAP was the Road Maintenance Trust Fund (RMTF), set up to ensure&#13;
the sustainable and transparent allocation of resources and funds as well as to carry out efficient&#13;
monitoring of maintenance, It was initially intended that the RMTF would have an independent source&#13;
of financing through a fuel levy. This levy is collected by the Government and the RMTF is provided&#13;
a budgetary allocation for financing maintenance. The financing of maintenance works by the World&#13;
Bank subsequently was intended to help the RDA to build capacity to optimize the selection of roads&#13;
for maintenance and align its processes towards minimizing costs. The operation of the RMTF is&#13;
overseen by a Board of Trustees with the assistance of a Technical Advisory Committee.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Developing local construction capacity&#13;
Due to the relatively small number of contracts previously offered to the private sector, the local&#13;
construction industry had limited opportunities to develop.This lack of experience in turn resulted in&#13;
most companies being unqualified to meet the World Bank's requirements for bidding. As a solution to&#13;
this impasse, RSAP encouraged a joint venture arrangements that enabled companies to join forces&#13;
and combine capacitiesThis would become one of the momentous strategies to be adoptedby the&#13;
project.&#13;
"RSAP's approach was a more comprehensive development of the highways sector&#13;
Initially, the RDA was apprehensive about the formation of joint ventures by contractors, as this was  than the traditionally isolated road development and maintenance. The state policy&#13;
something entirely new for the sector. Instead, the authority preferred to lower the qualification criteria.  articulated through the Ministry was to encourage, support and develop the local&#13;
The Bank's task team however, convinced the RDA to allow joint venture bidding.       construction sector, especially in the highway construction industry. RSAP was the&#13;
main vehicle for this and enabled local contractors to effectively compete with foreign&#13;
counterparts by introducing small sized road packages and encouraging local joint&#13;
venture partnerships. The project, with the concurrence of the World Bank, also&#13;
adopted special and concessionary procurement policies to accommodate local&#13;
contractors."&#13;
"Most of the local contractors grasped the opportunity. If they were not getting qualified&#13;
singly they formed joint ventures. When you can't handle a job alone, then you partner                                                   Gajaba Gunawaradena&#13;

maintenance costs meant that the switch to asphalt, based on sound economic analysis, proved&#13;
beneficial. Thus, the introduction of asphalt for the national roads resulted not only in improved quality&#13;
but also in long-term financial benefits, This required contractors to purchase asphalt plants, which&#13;
RSAP facilitated with an advance payment. By December 2014, the Central Environmental Authority&#13;
had granted 140 Environmental Protection Licences for asphalt plants, of which the RDA owns and&#13;
operates ten,&#13;

consent of the Conservator of Forests. We informed the Forest Department and the&#13;

To overcome the resistance of some contractors to comply with safeguards, RSAP's national roads&#13;
component introduced penalties for non-compliance for the first time in a roads project in Sri Lanka.&#13;
Social safeguards&#13;
RSAP used a social impacts management framework covering social safeguards. It included a&#13;
detailed entitlement matrix for all types of negative impacts that could result from the roadworks, a&#13;
grievance redress mechanism and space for public consultation.&#13;

Senior Social Development Specialist, WB  Transport sector workers are highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS as many of them spend large amour&#13;
time away from their homes. The workers are a migratory population, who often come to the ret&#13;
through labour suppliers, and stay temporarily in labour camps. This in turn makes people living  G&#13;
highways and roads vulnerable. In order to minimize a  possible health hazard due to lac&#13;
knowledge, the World Bank introduced an HIV/AIDS awareness program in the projects th i&#13;

ï»¿Resolving people's grievances&#13;
The grievance redress system that the project put in place made it possible for the public to resolve&#13;
their problems quickly, transparently and out of court. Complaints were addressed speedily -&#13;
sometimes even in a day or two. The public also had the benefit of a specially allocated hotline to&#13;
access project management with concerns and complaints. If people do not agree with the solution&#13;
offered, a Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) is formed so that they can make their case. The&#13;
committee's chairman is usually the RDA Provincial Director of the area and the Secretary the RDAs&#13;
Chief Engineer of the area. Other members include the Divisional Secretary, the Chairman of the loca&#13;
authority and a community leader. Depending on the complaint, others may be invited to participate&#13;
as well. The committee has a hearing, and more often than not there is a solution. If there is no&#13;
agreement, people can take legal action, RSAP received over 4000 complaints; all but two were&#13;
resolved on site, More than 60% of the public complaints or requests have been related to house&#13;
access, 25% to road access, and 10% to retaining and parapet walls. Only one person went on to&#13;
take legal action on a complaint about construction works causing water logging. A total of 4194&#13;
public complaints were addressed through RSAP's grievance redress mechanism, People often refer&#13;
to the World Bank's safeguard policies to protect their interests.&#13;
"The general public is increasingly aware that when the World Bank funds a project that&#13;
Its policies need to be put into practice. So this knowledge helps them deal better with&#13;
issues and grievances that they may encounter in the course of road construction."&#13;

ï»¿"Third party" benefit monitoring&#13;
An innovative concept that the RSAP introduced as a pilot initiative on the Kantale -Trincomalee road&#13;
was a system of monitoring benefits from the perspective of users and stakeholders. This would be&#13;
a means of gaining their views regard ng the road construction so that they could influence the design&#13;
and implementation of the project. The long-term objective was to make benefit monitoring by project&#13;
beneficiaries an integral part of road sector monitoring processes.&#13;
The Centre for Poverty Analysis was the intermediary, creating links between the user groups and the&#13;
implementers of the program, so that the former could proactively make suggestions.&#13;
"RSAP wanted to see how the people could get involved in monitoring the project. It&#13;
was called third party monitoring - but it was more beneficiary monitoring. The total&#13;
community was considered a monitoring group. It had not been tried in Sri Lanka&#13;
before. We mobilized three different groups of people living along the road, one of them&#13;
was from the transporters' association, comprising bus drivers and owners and&#13;
three-wheeler drivers, called the Kantale Transporters' Association. They felt they had a&#13;
direct stake and had a huge number of suggestions. We could see that they should&#13;
have been the first point of call in terms of project design and planning because they&#13;
knew which the blind spot was, where the road has failed, where it goes under water&#13;
etc, When we talked to the RDA we saw they had taken some of these suggestions on&#13;
board. We then talked to the people, helped them communicate with the RDA, and the&#13;
RDA responded - so the community was quite impressed."&#13;

ï»¿Responding to the Tsunami&#13;
Even before the roadworks planned under the RSAP began, the project had to deal with a national&#13;
crisis of unprecedented proportions. The Tsunami of 2004 struck Sri Lanka barely a year after RSAP&#13;
began its journey. The magnitude of the impact of the disaster called for an immediate response from&#13;
the donor community as well as the road sector&#13;
The rehabilitation of the roads damaged by the tsunami was coordinated by the Ministry of Highways&#13;
with the assistance of TAFREN [Task Force for Rehabilitating the Nation].&#13;
Bank credits in severa sectors were immediatey restructured to channe funds for the reconstrucion&#13;
of damaged infrastructure as we as for lvelihood support. RSAP made some adjustments to&#13;
incorporate the A2 from Kalutara to Matara, one of the country's busiest roads, Starting at the 47 km&#13;
South of Kalutara and ending at 1 61 kilometers on the outskirts of Matara, the 11 4 km road stretch&#13;
became the first post tsunami road rehabilitation project to be completed in 2005,&#13;

with local funding, then we sought donor funding for the permanent work.&#13;
We were quick in reacting to the tsunami While so many discussions were going on in&#13;
the other sectors. I convened all the donors who were already in the road sector - ADB,&#13;
WB, all of them, and we allocated various sections of roads to the consultants. They&#13;
came up with proposals within two weeks and we compiled it as one proposal&#13;
At that time donors also had a big problem, they wanted to help but they did not know&#13;
where to invest. When we submitted this proposal to the donor forum, the donors were&#13;
quick to respond."&#13;

A systematic and effective plan to address the challenges of rural road rehabilitation and maintenance&#13;
in Sri Lanka was long overdue. A key challenge addressed by RSAP was the lack of capacity in the&#13;
local authorities as well as local contractors for the rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads, This&#13;
stood in the way of an integrated and reliable rural road system that connected people with regional&#13;
economic centres and enabled the reduction of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿"Each Pradeshiya Sabha has just one technical officer, usually without adequate&#13;
technical knowledge. The project launched a systematic program for their technical&#13;
education, particularly in the area of road rehabilitation, We carried out the construction&#13;
work through small contractors with limited experience. So it was a learning curve for&#13;
them too. A capacity-building exercise. The contractors went through on-the-job&#13;
training, beginning with how to process the documents and prepare programs; how to&#13;
select materials, how to carry out quality control and testing. This continued throughout&#13;
the process of construction."&#13;

In addition to the rehabilitation of 160 km of roads and the building of local capacity, RSAP produced&#13;
a rural roads database and along with it a rural roads development strategy. The data generated&#13;
includes information such as road condition, vulnerability of roads to flooding, number of families with&#13;
direct access, percentage of Samurdhi (government welfare) recipients living along the roads, and the&#13;
main use of the roads - whether used for industrial or agricultural transport&#13;
The pilot project provided a good ndication of the benefits arising from simple, but well-structured&#13;
road interventions that enhanced both mobility and access to services and markets.&#13;

RSAP was of course not an ent rely smooth journey. The challenges experienced have been careuly&#13;
documented so that the lessons learnt and recommendations made can be taken into account in&#13;
future projects. During the long period of implementation of RSAP much of the learning has alry&#13;
been heeded and changes reflected in the recent investments.&#13;
Delays in approvals: Road contractors had to deal with delays caused by the time tn&#13;
by both the Central Environment Authority and the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB to&#13;
issue approvals and icenses. A realistic timeline, taking account of the ground situation, needs to be&#13;
built into contract periods to avoid unnecessary contractual delays.The Bank also suggestso&#13;
revision of guidelines for the issue of licences so that less time is taken for the process. Wit the&#13;
intention of addressing this delay the RDA had obtained licences in its own name which were&#13;
transferred to the contractor without assuming the risk.&#13;
66                                                                                                                                                                                   6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Changes to design: The National Road Sector Master Plan, which was finalized in 2007,  Involvement of provincial staff: Effective engagement and interest of the provincia&#13;
required the widening of roads from 5.5 m to 6.2 m. This called for changes in design after the award  staff at the design stage could have prevented some of the variation orders that resulted from&#13;
of the civil works contracts - causing delays in implementation as well as the escalation of costs and  provincial requirements reaching the project several years after its commencement,&#13;
sometimes questioning the capacity of the contractors to undertake the increased workload,&#13;
Identifying all of the parameters at the beginning of project implementation will prevent recourse to  Involvement of communities: Consultations were carried out at the inception of the&#13;
avoidable variations that are time and cost intensive.                          project to fully understand the requirements of communities and to incorporate these needs within the&#13;
project at the design stage. Experience has however shown that communities effectively engage in&#13;
Physical variations: The project experienced variations, which were 31 % of the original  such discussions predominantly during implementation. Therefore community consultations need to&#13;
awarded price. The design changes made to accommodate the widening of the road as well as  be carried out during the implementation of the contracts as well.&#13;
designs of culverts and drains not being identified upfront have contributed to this issue. This situation&#13;
arose due to the appropriate design requirements regarding culverts and drains not being identified  Spread of roads in the project and staff of the supervision&#13;
at the design stage. Moreover, revisions needed to be made to the contract drawings because they  consultant: As the RSAP was the first project for rehabilitation, the priority roads across the&#13;
did not match the ground profile. The revised 'vertical profiles' inevitably increased contract costs. The  entire nation were included and the geographical spread made it more difficult to supervise al of these&#13;
Bank recommends that the RDA should stipulate cross sections at shorter intervals for preparing  sections as the RDA themselves were not accustomed to supervision at such a scale. Moreover,&#13;
detailed engineering designs,The Bank also recommends the use of 'Design-Build' and 'Fixed-Price  since there are many donors involved in the rehabilitation of national roads, it would have been&#13;
Lump Sum' contracts to prevent avoidable physical variations during project implementation. The  operationally easier if the projects were less spread out.&#13;
RDA has also expressed interest in transferring some of the risks to the private contractors that they&#13;
are best able to bear.                                                          Unavailability of bitumen: The project has suffered from shortages in the avalabilty of&#13;
bitumen due to the high demand created by the roadworks. The monopoly supplier, the Ceylon&#13;
Estimation of contract periods: The original contract periods had been understated  Petroleum Corporation, in the past was not able to match demand with supply. The GOSL having&#13;
and the contracts neither fully appreciated nor reflected the work involved in difficult terrains, nor the  recognized this difficulty issued licences to allow the importation of bitumen by private contractors&#13;
additional work due to variations not fully reflecting the time for delays in environmental clearances,&#13;
which later required additional time for expansion of the scope of work.        The isolation of PMUs: The Project Management Unit was earlier isolated due to limited&#13;
participation from other units of the RDA - a situation somewhat aggravated by the differences in the&#13;
Sufficient time for completion of designs: Some of the shortcomings of the      incentives structure that applied to PMUs within the Government systems. The earlier interventions of&#13;
designs arose as a result of the short time periods allowed for the designs due to the urgency of the  the project suffered teething problems as a result of this separation, but this was subsequenty&#13;
project.                                                                        rectified by engaging the design units, planning division, R&amp;D unit etc., in the activities carried out by&#13;

RSAP has been a partnership between the World Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka that has&#13;
travelled a long journey through many phases of reform with significant impacts on the country's&#13;
construction industry as well as the Road Development Authority itself,&#13;
The World Bank's focus has been not just to lend money or rehabilitate roads, but also to achieve&#13;
development effectiveness by helping the country derive the maximum benefit, It looks at the change&#13;
the sector needs to make in the longer term to help it achieve the required efficiencies. In its new&#13;
interventions, the Bank aims to support Sri Lanka's road sector to function more efficiently and&#13;
optimize the use of funds. One important priority area is the long-term, continuous maintenance of the&#13;
assets to be achieved through a change in the RDAs business model.&#13;
74                                                                                                                                                                         7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿The RDA currently carries out ad-hoc maintenance based on the availability of finance, concentrating&#13;
on the "worst first", where the already rehabilitated network has been put at risk. The RDA is now in&#13;
the process of transitioning to an asset management concept where the planning, the interventions&#13;
and managing the asset is done over a longer time horizon rather than annually. This will allow the&#13;
private contracting entity to attend to required interventions on a timely basis, using a DBMOT Mode.&#13;
Due to the sharing of risk between the RDA and the contracting entity, some of the issues previously&#13;
"Several tools have been practised in several parts of the world to overcome issues on  encountered by RDA can be mitigated. Long-term asset management ensures that the correct thing&#13;
input based contracts and inadequate focus on maintenance. The most common and  is done at the correct time and the road users get a well-maintained network of roads. This, in turn,&#13;
successful tool, the Design-Build-Maintain-Operate and Transfer concept (DBMO7)  reduces travel time, vehicle operating costs, costs arising from road accidents - a considerable&#13;
has been successfully implemented in several regions. DBMOT is where the private  saving to the country's economy not forgetting the satisfaction of the road users,&#13;
sector carries out the design, construction and maintenance over a long period,&#13;
sharing risks with the Government."                                            The construction contracts currently in implementation in Sri Lanka are based on payment being&#13;
made on the amount of materials used; there is little incentive for contractors to save costs, As a&#13;
Seo PHaider Raza             result, the quantity variations and resulting contract payments are high. The Government is therefore&#13;
unable to have certainty in expenditure and need to secure funds beyond the budgeted amount.&#13;
Moreover, if something goes wrong with the design, that risk must also be borne by the Government&#13;
The Bank is therefore assisting the RDA to adopt a contract format that is more beneficial for the&#13;
country as a whole, which will provide the Government price certainty, and share risks between the&#13;
Government and the contractor, This will also encourage innovation by providing incentives to the&#13;
contractor to save costs, ensuring value for money.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿"Our aim is to take RDA a notch higher by helping the organization change its business&#13;
mode/ and evolve into a more service oriented organization. This will enable the RDA to&#13;
mitigate some of the risks presently experienced and achieve efficiency in expenditure,&#13;
that will also benefit the local construction industry by providing them access to&#13;
continuous long term work which will incentivize skill development"&#13;

"Under RSAP the World Bank helped us build our capacity in different fields. Training&#13;
was a priority The Bank is helping the RDA move away from a project implementation&#13;
agency to an assets management agency That is our vision."&#13;
