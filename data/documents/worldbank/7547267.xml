        <abstracts>
            More than 24 countries operate separate
            boards and exchanges aimed at small and medium-size
            enterprises (SMEs). Equity markets play a critical role in
            fostering economic productivity by financing innovation. But
            only a few SME exchanges function properly, providing
            coveted fresh capital and liquidity. What steps are key to
            building an efficient exchange to provide risk capital for
            SMEs? Creating an SME-friendly market architecture supported
            by effective institutions and forging links to policies that
            foster a new class of investable equities.
