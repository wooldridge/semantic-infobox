This report is based on an Appraisal Mission which visited Turkey in July&#13;
1994, consisting of Paul Andre Blanchet (Task Manager and Senior Municipal&#13;
Engineer), Henry Boldrick (Senior Financial Analyst), Vincent Lacour (Senior&#13;
Urban Planner) and Sunja Kim (Financial Analyst). Snezana Mitrovic&#13;
(Consultant EClIN) and Ahmet Gokce (Engineer EClTU) also participated in the&#13;
preparation of the project. The peer reviewers were Anthony Pellegrini&#13;
(Director, TWUDR) and Sergio Calegari (Principal Sanitary Engineer, MNIIN).&#13;
Supervising managers are Ricardo Halpeiin, Chief EClIN, and Rachel Lomax,&#13;
Director EC1. The financial assistance of the Government of Japan, which&#13;
provided a grant to help prepare the project, is gratefully acknowledged.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY&#13;
ANTALYA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:     Antalya Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (ASAT)&#13;
Guarantor:    Republic of Turkey&#13;
Poverty:      Not applicable&#13;
Loan Amount:  US$100.0 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:        Seventeen years, including five-years grace period, at the Bank's&#13;
standard variable interest rate.&#13;
Project&#13;
Objectives:   The objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) meet at least&#13;
cost the demand for water supply, sewerage and stormwater drainage;&#13;
(b) develop new institutional arrangements for management of&#13;
municipal water supply, sewerage and stormwater drainage, and to&#13;
introduce private sector participation in the operation of the&#13;
services; (c) implement appropriate cost recovery policies; (d)&#13;
postpone the need to develop costly new water resources by&#13;
improving the efficiency of utilization of existing sources and of&#13;
water usage by reducing the volume of non-revenue water which is&#13;
presently too high (46 percent); (e) improve and sustain&#13;
environmental conditions and reduce health hazards that threaten&#13;
the local population and the tourism industry by: (i) eliminating&#13;
deficiencies in the collection and disposal of municipal sewage;&#13;
and (ii) improving stormwater drainage in areas suffering seasonal&#13;
flooding.&#13;
Project&#13;
Description:  The Project comprises water supply, sewerage and stormwater&#13;
components. While leaving the legal authority with the borrower&#13;
(ASAT), the administrative and financial management of the services&#13;
will be consolidated within a company (Sirket) owned by ASAT, AMM&#13;
and the District Municipalities (DMs) and incorporated under&#13;
Turkish trade law. The Sirket will also oversee the operation of&#13;
the services by a private operator under lease and management&#13;
contracts. The project represents the first phase, to be&#13;
implemented from 1995 through 2002, of a program designed to&#13;
continue to the year 2020. The project will: (a) renovate,&#13;
rehabilitate and extend the existing water supply network; (b)&#13;
provide a new sewerage network and a preliminary wastewater&#13;
treatment plant on the western part of the Municipality; (c)&#13;
improve operation of septic tanks in the eastern part of the city;&#13;
(d) upgrade the stormwater drainage system in flood areas and&#13;
elaborate a comprehensive master plan; and (e) provide technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
assistance for project implementation (engineering services and&#13;
project management) and institutional development (particularly&#13;
training of Sirket personnel, and preparation of the lease and&#13;
management arrangements).&#13;
Benefits&#13;
and Risks:    The Project approach supports the Government's decentralization&#13;
objective in shifting investment responsibility from the government&#13;
budget to the Municipality, which will recover costs through user&#13;
charges. In addition, it will: (a) promote managerial efficiency&#13;
and improve service quality through new institutional arrangements&#13;
that will introduce private sector participation through lease and&#13;
management contracts in the operation of the water supply and&#13;
sewerage services; (b) reduce health hazards to the local and&#13;
tourist population; and (c) improve environmental conditions.&#13;
Project risks relate to: (a) the challenge of setting up, for the&#13;
first time in Turkey, lease and management arrangements for the&#13;
operation of public utilities; (b) the Sirket's institutional and&#13;
financial capacity to carry out a large investment program in view&#13;
of potential political interference; (c) the sustained willingness&#13;
of municipal authorities to maintain cost recovery measures&#13;
necessary to assure affordability and self-financing; (d) the&#13;
ability of Iller Bank and DSI to complete their investments within&#13;
the expected time; and (e) the time required to complete all land&#13;
acquisition. Project preparation and design have aimed to minimize&#13;
all these risks.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY&#13;
ANTALYA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT AND ISSUES&#13;
Population&#13;
1.01        The population of Turkey in 1993 was estimated at 60.0 million, with&#13;
60 percent living in urban areas. Population growth averaged 2.3 percent per&#13;
year during the last decade. The overall growth rate is expected to average 2.0&#13;
percent during the 1990s and to reach 72 million by the year 2002. Rural&#13;
migration to urban areas is expected to continue and to constitute a major cause&#13;
of growing demand for developed land and for water, sewerage and solid waste&#13;
services in urban areas.&#13;
Water Resources&#13;
1.02        Turkey enjoys abundant aggregate water resources, but there are some&#13;
regions where water shortages are prevalent throughout the year, and others where&#13;
seasonal shortages occur. Water resources are estimated at about 200 billion&#13;
m3/year, including surface water that flows out of the country. At present,&#13;
withdrawals from surface water resources are estimated at about 15.6 billion&#13;
m3/year, with about 60 percent used for irrigation and the rest for municipal and&#13;
industrial use. Water abstraction from aquifers is regulated through drilling&#13;
licenses, but surface water intakes are not licensed. There are no fees for&#13;
underground or surface water.&#13;
Service Coverage&#13;
1.03        Service coverage levels for municipal water in Turkey, as indicated&#13;
in Annex 1.1, appear high (971 and 85% of urban and rural populations served with&#13;
public water), but the quality of the services received by the population is&#13;
often poor. Water pressure drops and cutoffs of service are frequent because of&#13;
source and distribution limitations. Average water consumption (77 lcd) is low&#13;
compared to developing countries in Europe (about 200 lcd). The number of&#13;
employees per thousand connections (4.3) is high compared to developing countries&#13;
in Europe (3.2), but low compared to most developing countries (5 to 6).&#13;
Sector Institutions in the Central Government&#13;
1.04        In the Central Government, the responsibility for water, wastewater&#13;
and solid waste is shared by six different organizations:&#13;
*     the State Planning Organization (SPO) is responsible for reviewing and&#13;
approving investment plans in the sector;&#13;
*     the State Hydraulic Works Department (DSI), under the Ministry of Public&#13;
Works and Settlements, is responsible for national water resources&#13;
management, development and operation of major water sources, and provision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
of water supply to cities with a population greater than 100,000, except&#13;
for some of the largest municipalities (para. 1.06);&#13;
*     the Iller Bank (Bank of the Provinces, IB), also under the Ministry of&#13;
Public Works and Settlements, is responsible for water supply and sewerage&#13;
development for small cities and construction of solid waste disposal sites&#13;
in all urban areas, except for some major cities;&#13;
*     the General Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS), under the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, Forestry and Village Affairs, is responsible for rural water&#13;
supply and sanitation programs;&#13;
*     the Ministry of Health is responsible for the control of quality of the&#13;
water sources and supply to consumers; and&#13;
*     the Ministry of Environment is responsible for controlling the&#13;
implementation of environmental legislation.&#13;
Sector Operating Agencies&#13;
1.05        There are at present two types of entities providing water supply and&#13;
sewerage services. In most of the municipalities, the services are generally&#13;
provided by departments within the municipal administration. In metropolitan&#13;
areas, however, the services are provided by autonomous, municipally-owned water&#13;
and sewerage authorities.&#13;
1.06        The municipal water and sewerage authorities have a short history.&#13;
The first was the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (ISKI), created in&#13;
1981 as an autonomous entity responsible for the planning, design, construction,&#13;
and operation and maintenance of all water supply and sewerage facilities in&#13;
Greater Istanbul. Creation of an autonomous utility reflected recognition of the&#13;
complex problems faced in large urban areas and was intended to enable an&#13;
increasing share of sector investment to be financed with internally generated&#13;
funds. Of particular significance, ISKI's enabling law gave the Municipal&#13;
Council the right to set water tariffs and sewerage charges without prior&#13;
approval by the Central Government, as had been required before. Also, 1981&#13;
legislation defining metropolitan municipalities enabled entities such as ISKI to&#13;
take over the water supply and sewerage services of smaller municipalities near&#13;
the metropolitan area. Initially, ISKI was relatively successful and this&#13;
approach became compulsory for all metropolitan municipalities. By 1993, there&#13;
were 15 metropolitan municipalities, including Antalya, which contained about 18&#13;
million peoples, or over 30 percent of the population.&#13;
1.07        The autonomous water authorities have not only substantially&#13;
increased the internal generation of funds in the sector, but they have also&#13;
obtained long-term credits for sector development. Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir&#13;
water authorities, for example, have financed with internally generated funds a&#13;
substantial percentage of their investment in recent years. Istanbul, Ankara,&#13;
Izmir and Bursa water authorities have r-ceived Bank loans and bilateral credits&#13;
from several countries, including France, Germany and Kuwait. In contrast, the&#13;
services provided directly by the municipal departments generally cover no more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
than the operating expenses, and long-term capital is unavailable from sources&#13;
other than DSI and Iller Bank.&#13;
1.08        Although the institutional framework for water and sanitation&#13;
services provided by the 1981 legislation represents a substantial improvement&#13;
over the traditional municipal department, it is not fully adequate to meet the&#13;
challenge faced by sector authorities in the 1990s. Municipal political&#13;
influence still plays an important role, not only in major policy decisions, but&#13;
also in the entities' day-to-day operations.  In addition, the water authorities'&#13;
staffing plans and remuneration levels have to be approved by the Central&#13;
Government (Ministry of Interior), which results in delays in decisions,&#13;
insufficient consideration for the particular needs of the specific authority and&#13;
lack of accountability.  The commercial orientation of the utilities is often&#13;
constrained by political considerations. Future institutional arrangements&#13;
should take into account the lessons learned from the experiences of existing&#13;
authorities (paras. 1.21 through 1.23).&#13;
Sector Investment&#13;
1.09        Turkey invested substantial amounts in water supply and sewerage&#13;
during the 1980s. Total water and sewerage investments (Central Government and&#13;
water authorities) from 1980 to 1989 are estimated at over US$4 billion (at 1990&#13;
prices). Sector investments in the last four years of the decade represented&#13;
about 0.7 percent of the country's GNP, which is high by international standards&#13;
(0.5 percent). This relatively high level of investment is consistent with the&#13;
improvements in service coverage (para. 1.03), but some investments were&#13;
relatively inefficient as a result of inadequate project selection and execution&#13;
(para. 1.12) and, subsequently, of poor operation and maintenance.&#13;
1.10        The bulk (80-90 percent) of the sector investments were carried out&#13;
by the Central Government through Iller Bank, DSI and GDRS. The other 10-20&#13;
percent were undertaken by the respective municipal entities responsible for&#13;
water and sewerage. The breakdown, by executing agency, of Central Government&#13;
investments in the water and sewerage sector is shown in Annex 1.2.&#13;
Sector Financinq&#13;
1.11        Sector investment financing policy has been changing in a positive&#13;
direction since the early 1980s. Until that time, it was Central Government&#13;
policy to finance virtually all investments through Iller Bank, DSI and GDRS. In&#13;
recent years, however, the Government has reduced its investments in metropolitan&#13;
areas (paras. 1.06 and 1.07) and thus has encouraged the mobilization of local&#13;
financial resources. This was a much needed change in sector policy because the&#13;
Government-financed investments represented a heavy fiscal burden (between 1.8&#13;
percent and 4.1 percent of annual Government expenditures between 1980 to 1989,&#13;
or between 7.5 percent and 22.8 percent of annual investments during the same&#13;
time).&#13;
1.12        The Government policies undeL which Iller Bank, DSI and GDRS operate&#13;
contribute to allocative and technical inefficiencies. First, the financing&#13;
provided is heavily subsidized as the interest rates charged to the&#13;
municipalities are highly negative in real terms. Second, large investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
programs, involving over-contracting works in response to political pressures,&#13;
result in slowdown, and sometimes even in interruption, of work because of&#13;
insufficient funds. Third, water supply and sewerage networks are frequently&#13;
over-designed, assuming population increases, per capita consumption and periods&#13;
of time that are excessive.&#13;
Private Sector Involvement&#13;
1.13        Private sector involvement in the provision of services has been&#13;
limited. One municipal water authority (BUSKI) has recently contracted out the&#13;
reading of water meters and billing of service charges. To date, no management&#13;
contract, lease, concession or other form of contracting has been implemented for&#13;
water or sewerage system operation by the private sector.&#13;
Sector Objectives&#13;
1.14        The objectives of the central sector authorities are to ensure prompt&#13;
provision of: (a) safe water and sewerage to the population that is not currently&#13;
covered, and (b) sewage treatment facilities to most of the population. Due to&#13;
population growth, it is also necessary to serve an estimated 16 million&#13;
additional inhabitants by the year 2002. Simultaneously, the quality of the&#13;
services will have to be improved significantly. To address the above-mentioned&#13;
objectives, the ten-year total investment needs for new and upgraded urban water&#13;
supply and sewerage facilities during the 1990s are estimated to be approximately&#13;
US$10 billion equivalent (at 1990 prices), with half concentrated in the&#13;
metropolitan centers.&#13;
Environmental Issues&#13;
1.15        Water pollution is an acute problem in urban and industrial zones&#13;
around Istanbul and in the major metropolitan centers like Izmit, Izmir, Ankara&#13;
and Bursa; it also extends to the tourist areas of the southern Turkish&#13;
Mediterranean coast where Antalya is located. There is a growing concern not&#13;
only to better protect surface water resources because a major part of the&#13;
groundwater reserves has already been exploited, but also to protect natural&#13;
tourist attractions. Water supply, especially for major cities, will&#13;
increasingly have to come from surface water. Few systems have adequate&#13;
interception of sewage or any treatment. Domestic and industrial pollution is&#13;
also of concern, especially when liquid effluent is discharged in environmentally&#13;
sensitive areas such as coastlines.&#13;
1.16        In response to all these problems, both the Government and the&#13;
municipalities are beginning to take a much more aggressive stance toward&#13;
environmental protection. The General Directorate of the Environment (GDE) was&#13;
established in 1984 to oversee implementation of the Environmental Law and its&#13;
regulations and to manage the National Pollution Prevention Fund (NPPF). Another&#13;
indication of the Government's growing commitment to environmental protection was&#13;
the decision in 1991 to upgrade the GDE to the ministry level.&#13;
I&#13;
1.17        The Environmental Law (No. 2872 of 1983) -- which seeks to protect&#13;
and optimize land and natural resources usage, to prevent air, water and land&#13;
degradation, and to protect health, bio-diversity and cultural property --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
provided the first general framework for environmental protection. Subsequently,&#13;
regulations governing air quality and noise (1986), marine pollution (1987) and&#13;
water pollution (1988) were promulgated. The Environmental Law stipulates that&#13;
polluters must cover costs associated with pollution abatement and prevention and&#13;
bear responsibility for all damages. Under the Turkish water pollution&#13;
regulations, national water quality objectives for inland waters were defined in&#13;
1991, specifying four classes of water quality: class I for high-quality water&#13;
suitable for water supply, recreation and fisheries; class II for fairly polluted&#13;
water suitable for irrigation and other uses after appropriate treatment; class&#13;
III for polluted water suitable for industries other than food and textiles; and&#13;
class IV for highly polluted water having no beneficial end use.&#13;
1.18        The enforcement of the regulations designed to protect the&#13;
environment is generally the responsibility of the municipalities and provincial&#13;
governments. The municipalities' capacity to implement the regulations&#13;
effectively has still to be developed. The most important role in enforcing&#13;
regulations regarding the protection of water resources in metropolitan areas has&#13;
been given to the municipal water and sewerage authorities (para. 3.04).&#13;
Municipalities and water authorities, which have made progress in evaluating the&#13;
quality of industrial effluent, are now requiring polluting industries to invest&#13;
in on-site treatment. Metropolitan municipalities, including Antalya, have&#13;
ambitious programs to improve sewage collection, treatment and disposal.&#13;
Effluent monitoring capacity and enforcement of regulations through inspection by&#13;
the water authorities remain to be improved.&#13;
Previous World Bank Involvement in the Sector&#13;
1.19        The Bank initiated water sector operations in Turkey over 20 years&#13;
ago (1972) with a US$37 million loan for the Istanbul Water Supply Project. It&#13;
has continued its operations through seven more loans to Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir&#13;
and Bursa water authorities, and to small municipalities in the Cukurova Region.&#13;
Five of the projects are still under implementation. To date, the loans provided&#13;
to the sector amount to US$946.3 million (Annex 1.3).&#13;
1.20        The Bank's participation in the water and sanitation sector has been&#13;
an important factor in encouraging the Government to establish municipal water&#13;
authorities. The Bank has also played an important role in assisting these&#13;
authorities during their early operation. The Bank-financed projects have been&#13;
generally successful in meeting their physical targets, and in encouraging much&#13;
needed investment in sewerage services. The concept of full cost recovery for&#13;
the services has contributed to progressively improved efficiency in the&#13;
management and operation of these public companies. Lessons learned from the&#13;
previous projects have indicated, however, a need to improve efficiency. At the&#13;
same time, the constraints to efficiency faced by public sector entities have&#13;
become increasingly evident and there is a growing consensus that private sector&#13;
participation would improve project management and financial discipline. On the&#13;
technical side, past projections of water sales and implementation schedules were&#13;
proved to be too optimistic. For timely and successful project implementation,&#13;
detailed designs should be prepared in the early stages of the project. It is&#13;
equally important to obtain a clear political commitment to cost recovery and&#13;
improvement of the water authorities' finances, accounting and audits. The&#13;
proposed project takes the above lessons into account and goes a step further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
than previous projects by promoting important institutional changes to enable&#13;
significant private sector involvement. This concept responds to changes in the&#13;
Government's evolving vision of the respective roles of the public and private&#13;
sectors and it is fully supported by Antalya municipal authorities.&#13;
Bank's Strategy in the Sector&#13;
1.21        The Bank's strategy towards Turkey is outlined in the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS) submitted to the Board on March 11, 1993. Within the&#13;
overall objectives of the CAS, the Bank had agreed with the Government to support&#13;
projects which improve the environment, promote sustainable use of natural&#13;
resources, and strengthen local institutions' capacity to achieve these&#13;
objectives. Recently, the Bank prepared a review of sector issues (Urban Water&#13;
and Sanitation Sector Review, March 26, 1993) which was discussed at a workshop&#13;
held in Antalya in October 1993. This workshop was designed to promote&#13;
discussions of institutional changes that may be required so as to remove the&#13;
central Government from its present close involvement (through Iller Bank and&#13;
DSI--paras. 1.10 thru 1.12) in the planning and funding of most water supply and&#13;
sanitation investments, and to promote decentralization of investment&#13;
responsibilities and service delivery provision to local utilities, which should&#13;
be financially autonomous and managed free from bureaucratic constraints, thereby&#13;
encouraging privatization wherever possible.&#13;
1.22        The Bank's strategy in assisting the Government has two objectives.&#13;
The first is to continue supporting the development of the newly-created water&#13;
authorities in the larger municipalities so as to enable them to provide adequate&#13;
services at affordable prices. The satisfactory development of these authorities&#13;
in areas of rapid population growth should have significant direct benefits for&#13;
about 30 percent of the country's population (para. 1.06). To provide this, the&#13;
Bank is now seeking to promote revised institutional arrangements and operational&#13;
practices which involve the private sector. The second objective is to help&#13;
address the needs of smaller municipalities. Given the severe budgetary&#13;
constraints of the Central Government, it is evident that the infrastructure&#13;
demands of these municipalities cannot be met without significant local resource&#13;
mobilization. In addition, the capacity for project implementation and operation&#13;
and maintenance of infrastructure must be developed. However, this capacity is&#13;
constrained by a wide range of problems, including: (a) lack of transparency of&#13;
the role of Iller Bank and DSI, and of their performance and financial&#13;
arrangements; (b) lack of flexibility in the legislation for setting up municipal&#13;
administrative structures; (c) lack of adequate municipal legislation to promote&#13;
local resource mobilization; (d) constraints stemming from the present&#13;
legislation on the sector's ability to set competitive salaries, thus limiting&#13;
the possibilities to promote development of the managerial and technical capacity&#13;
of municipal personnel; and (e) lack of a legal framework to promote the&#13;
involvement of the private sector. Correction of these problems is a massive&#13;
agenda that can only be carried out in stages. Accordingly, the Bank is now&#13;
working, for the Southwest Coast area, to establish a realistic basis for&#13;
priority investments and an appropriate institutional framework, including&#13;
financial intermediation arrangements, to reach smaller municipalities.&#13;
1.23        The proposed project would be an important step in the implementation&#13;
of the Bank's strategy in the sector. In particular, the institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
development component of the project, which involves private sector&#13;
participation, takes into account the experience of previous projects and has a&#13;
significant potential for replication. The proposed project was prepared and&#13;
negotiated simultaneously with a solid waste management project for Antalya&#13;
(para. 3.01). The proposed solid waste management project would also be an&#13;
important element of the Bank support to the Government in its efforts to improve&#13;
environmental conditions and to strengthen local institutions capacity. The&#13;
solid waste management project would aim at: (a) improving solid waste&#13;
collection; (b) developing a new sanitary landfill; (c) improving land management&#13;
and pollution monitoring; and (d) contracting out with the private sector solid&#13;
waste operations and street sweeping. The solid waste management project is&#13;
expected to be submitted for Board consideration shortly, after Antalya&#13;
Metropolitan Municipality completes all the necessary requirements for acquiring&#13;
the land for the landfill.&#13;
II. PROJECT AREA. SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND&#13;
Project Area&#13;
2.01        The project area, which embraces the Antalya Metropolitan&#13;
Municipality (AMM) and surrounding districts, lies in the Antalya Province of&#13;
Turkey. Situated on a large fertile plain, the region is bound on three sides by&#13;
mountains rising to over 3,000 meters above sea level. The topography is unusual&#13;
in that the coastline in the central part of the Municipality is located on an&#13;
ancient travertine terrace which rises about 30 m vertically from the sea in&#13;
rugged cliffs and thence in successive terraces to the foot of the Taurus&#13;
Mountains about 40 kms to the north. The terraces are formed of a highly&#13;
fractured and porous karstic travertine several hundred meters thick. On the&#13;
east and west sides of the Municipality, the perimeter of the travertine&#13;
formation has eroded over the years and the flat valleys are covered with&#13;
alluvial deposits that vary from cobbles to stiff clay. Antalya is flanked by&#13;
extensive beaches (Lara Beach to the east and Konyaalti Beach to the west) and is&#13;
bounded by the Bogacay River on the west (800 km2 drainage basin) and the Aksu&#13;
Cayi River (6,472 km2 basin, average annual flow of 1,300 million m3/y) on the&#13;
east, which are continuous streams discharging into the Mediterranean Sea. There&#13;
are two dams on the Aksu Cayi River, Karacaoren I and II, each with a hydropower&#13;
plant. Of less importance are the streams of Sarisu (0.5 to 0.6 m3/s), Arapsuyu&#13;
(0.5 to 1.3 m3/s), and Duden (16.6 to 41.5 m3/s), which are fed by emerging&#13;
springs that eventually discharge, through spectacular waterfalls, into the sea.&#13;
The area enjoys a typical Mediterranean climate of hot, dry summers and&#13;
refreshing winters. Virtually all the annual rainfall occurs between November&#13;
and March. The average temperature varies from 10.20C in January to 28.10C in&#13;
July, and the average rainfall is 1,065 mm/y.&#13;
2.02        One of the ten most populous cities in Turkey, Antalya's estimated&#13;
1994 population of 491,000 has been growing at an average annual rate of 7&#13;
percent, the highest in the country. The high growth rate is due primarily to&#13;
migration from the rural areas and to the choice of Antalya as a retirement home&#13;
by large numbers of middle- and high-income pensioners from all over the country,&#13;
attracted by the natural beauty and favorable weather conditions. Future growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
is expected to result in the following population levels: 1995--530,000, 2000--&#13;
709,000, 2005--905,000, with estimated growth rates of seven percent in 1990 to&#13;
five percent in 2005 (Annex 2.1). The population in AMM is divided among the&#13;
three district municipalities (DMs) of Konyaalti (three percent), Muratpasa (62&#13;
percent) and Kepez (35 percent).&#13;
2.03        Presently, the Municipality encompasses 9,610 ha and has almost&#13;
extended to its natural boundaries. Land development has radiated inland from&#13;
the commercial and administrative center, which includes the historical Old City&#13;
(mostly a conservation area), and along the shore line. The current tendency is&#13;
to transfer industry outside the municipal boundaries to an industrial park of&#13;
197 ha (estimated 140 industrial plants for about 6,000 workers) located 26 km&#13;
north of the Municipality, along the Antalya-Burdur highway. The bell-shape&#13;
macro-form of the city is characterized by a densely populated center (500 to 600&#13;
inhabitants per hectare) and attenuating densities toward outer zones.&#13;
2.04        Some 80 percent of the region's population derives its income from&#13;
agriculture. A significant center for commerce and tourism, Antalya provides&#13;
services for the whole of Antalya Province. It is also the site of significant&#13;
industrial development, especially in agro-based industries. Total hotel bed&#13;
capacity reached 14,000 in 1989 and 28,000 in 1992. A comparison of national and&#13;
Antalya income by quintile distribution shows that average income in Antalya is&#13;
slightly lower and that the distribution is roughly similar to the country as a&#13;
whole (Annex 2.2).&#13;
Water Supply - Existing Facilities, Level of Services and Demand&#13;
2.05        Antalya's present water supply is from springs (about 17 percent) and&#13;
wells (83 percent). The estimated water produced over the last three years is:&#13;
1990--83,500 m3, 1991--87,300 m3 and 1992--100,500 m3.  After chlorination, clear&#13;
and clean water from springs and wells is pumped either to reservoirs at a high&#13;
elevation or directly into the distribution network. Magara, Meydan and Topcular&#13;
sources, which show traces, sometimes above allowable limits, of ammonia&#13;
nitrogen, orthophosphate, lead and zinc, will have to be abandoned soon. There&#13;
are 20 licensed wells producing some 11,600 m3/d and about 100 private wells at&#13;
various locations in the Municipality, especially to the east in the Dudenbasi&#13;
and Lara districts. Together they produce some 12,100 m3/d, of which 75 percent&#13;
is used for irrigation. Sources and pumping facilities are sufficient to meet&#13;
the Municipality's demand, but the water network does not have enough capacity&#13;
(Annex 2.3).&#13;
2.06        In 1975, Iller Bank designed and installed 155 km of PVC and asbestos&#13;
cement pipe, the first major extension of a diameter of 100 mm or less to the&#13;
existing cast iron pipe network. The network was divided into four pressure&#13;
zones. In 1987, DSI design proposed the same pressure zones as those recommended&#13;
in the 1975 Iller Bank study and added two more for the higher zones. After&#13;
1985, the Antalya Water Supply and Bus Department (ASO) laid more than 300 km of&#13;
pipeline (asbestos, steel, PVC pipes of diameter 100 mm or less), which were not&#13;
in compliance with the DSI design. As a result, the built network is undersized&#13;
and lacks reservoir capacity (presently there are seven reservoirs with a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
capacity of 27,150 m3); the Duraliler sources cannot be used to their full&#13;
capacity, and polluted Magara, Meydan and Topcular sources have not been taken&#13;
out of service (para. 2.05). In addition, the system is poorly equipped with air&#13;
relief valves, becomes air-locked after each failure of the power supply, and&#13;
three of the pressure zones are interconnected at different locations to provide&#13;
water to customers. DSI initiated a construction program in 1992 including&#13;
construction of water mains, pumping stations and reservoirs (Annex 2.4).&#13;
2.07        In 1994, the number of connections was estimated at 143,000.  The&#13;
distribution within consumption groups is as follows: (a) domestic 88 percent;&#13;
(b) commercial 10 percent; (c) construction 1.2 percent; (d) institutional &lt;1&#13;
percent; and (e) industrial &lt;1 percent. An estimated 95 percent of the&#13;
population is served. The non-revenue water was estimated at about 46 percent of&#13;
total production; physical losses 41 percent (38 percent due to leakages and&#13;
three percent due to the estimated 10,000 malfunctioning and under-reading&#13;
meters) and commercial losses five percent. Commercial losses are estimated at&#13;
4,230 m3/d: about 3,960 m3/d for public fountains, parks, mosques, fire fighting&#13;
and street cleaning, and 270 m3/d for illegal connections.  Total water billed&#13;
per capita served is in line with urban areas in Turkey (100 to 120 lcd) and in&#13;
other middle-income countries, but it is low compared to developed countries in&#13;
Europe (about 200 lcd).&#13;
2.08        It is expected that water leakages could be reduced from 41 percent&#13;
in 1992 to 30 percent in 2005 with the replacement of part of the network and the&#13;
project's proposed program for reduction of unaccounted-for-water, which would be&#13;
included in the leasing arrangement for the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
network (paras. 3.08 and 3.10). Domestic water sold is conservatively projected&#13;
to increase from 94 lcd in 1992 to 98 lcd in 1998 and to 128 lcd in 2005. This&#13;
estimates take into account the projected tariff increases (para. 4.06) which are&#13;
expected to result in increased conservation efforts. Future gross demand also&#13;
reflects population growth, an increase service coverage (from 95 percent of&#13;
population served today to 98 percent by 2005), and increases in institutional,&#13;
commercial and industrial water demand in proportion to land development (1992--&#13;
92,846 m3/d, 1998--165,911 m3/d, 2005--252,530 m3/d, 2020--391,712 m3/d -- see&#13;
Annex 2.3). The resulting demand forecast has been used in determining the&#13;
technical criteria for the water supply and sewerage components of the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
2.09        The future gross water demand is expected to be met mainly through&#13;
renovation of the existing Duraliler and Bogacay well fields and development of&#13;
Distas well fields, which postpones until after 2020 more costly alternatives.&#13;
Proposed use of water sources to satisfy the future demand and a chart of source&#13;
capacity compared to water net and gross demands are shown in Annex 2.3. To meet&#13;
the increased demand up to 2005, the required investment in water production&#13;
facilities is small, but the required investment in water distribution is&#13;
substantial.&#13;
Sewerage - Existing Facilities, Level of Services and Demand&#13;
2.10        There is no municipal sewerage in Antalya, except in small isolated&#13;
areas such as the industrial areas, the duty-free zone, the Old City (partly),&#13;
the university, and some blocks of apartment buildings where operation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
maintenance are the responsibility of users. Traditionally, because of the&#13;
unusual characteristics of the underlying karstic base-rock, effluent from septic&#13;
tanks or cesspits from each house infiltrates directly into the underlying&#13;
travertine formation (Annex 2.5). Some of the soaking pits (zerzemins) are&#13;
connected to faults, cracks or caverns in the rock, so effluent is indirectly&#13;
discharged into the sea.&#13;
2.11        Septic tanks are emptied by the Environmental Health Department of&#13;
the Municipality and three private contractors. Septage collected from septic&#13;
tanks is discharged into a 2,000 m3 pit, dug in highly permeable ground, in the&#13;
controlled solid waste dump site located upstream of the main potable water&#13;
source, Duraliler (para. 2.06). This poses a major health risk which will be&#13;
addressed under the project by disposing of the septage in the sewerage under&#13;
construction.&#13;
2.12         Inadequate wastewater disposal methods and harmful agriculture&#13;
practices have polluted the underlying karstic base-rock. This has forced the&#13;
authority to abandon some older potable water sources (yacht harbor and old&#13;
city), and it will soon have to abandon others as well (paras. 2.05 and 2.06).&#13;
2.13        The 1992 sewerage master plan has been designed and partly tendered&#13;
by Iller Bank. The proposed system is divided into two separate networks to&#13;
collect the sewage flow from the western and eastern parts of the Municipality&#13;
with wastewater treatment plants and sea outfalls. The construction of a portion&#13;
of the western network was started in 1992; it was limited to collectors larger&#13;
than 400mm and two of the 15 proposed pumping stations. Subsequently, in June&#13;
1993, complementary funds for constructing the missing secondary networks and&#13;
house connections to this proposed initial primary network were added (Annex&#13;
2.6). This Iller Bank network will cover 2,426 ha and cost US$32 million (1993&#13;
prices). According to the Iller Bank program, work will be completed in 2002.&#13;
2.14        An extension to the Iller Bank western network covering an additional&#13;
1,656 ha is part of the proposed project. This extension includes a preliminary&#13;
wastewater treatment plant with a long sea outfall south of the new harbor. It&#13;
will assure partial protection of at least three water supply sources and obviate&#13;
the difficulties of building individual systems in the saturated land of the&#13;
western part of the Municipality. Once construction is completed, the population&#13;
connected to the west side network in 2002 is estimated at about 400,000 or about&#13;
50 percent of the total population. Estimated wastewater treatment capacity and&#13;
population equivalent (PE) including BOD, COD and Suspended Solid for the years&#13;
1998, 2002, 2005 and 2020, are indicated in Annex 2.7. As at present, the&#13;
remaining part of the west side and all of the east side would continue to be&#13;
served by individual disposal systems.&#13;
2.15        According to the hydrogeol-'g4cal study, a groundwater flow of about&#13;
five m3/s discharges into the sea from the travertine along the coast. Surveys&#13;
have indicated that pollution is insignificant when this flow is diluted with sea&#13;
water, except in the old port, where sea water pollution is higher but still&#13;
rated as class I (para. 1.17). During preparation of the project, an&#13;
oceanographic investigation, including analysis of the assimilative capacity of&#13;
the sea using the Tgo die-away and dye-tracking method, was performed. Results&#13;
have indicated that the dilution factor is high, hence its assimilative capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
This first investigation has resulted in a preliminary design of the necessary&#13;
outfall and diffusor to the proposed preliminary wastewater treatment plant.&#13;
Further oceanographic investigations are planned during the final design phase.&#13;
Since only part of the population will be connected to the network, the dilution&#13;
factor with the sea water should be sufficient to maintain, at any time, a&#13;
pollution level of class I. Sea water quality will be monitored regularly,&#13;
particularly at the outfall location, and an activated sludge treatment plant&#13;
will be added when necessary. This solution is flexible and allows an&#13;
affordable, staged investment.&#13;
Stormwater Drainage - Existing Facilities. Level of Services and Demand&#13;
2.16        Natural drainage systems are abundant in the Antalya region.  Six&#13;
rivers, a canal and several deep creeks cross the Municipality and discharge&#13;
directly into the sea (para. 2.01). In spite of the fact that there is very&#13;
little formal storm drainage (except in the central part of the Municipality),&#13;
few flooding problems occur. This is because of the unusual characteristics of&#13;
the underlying travertine, which readily allows percolation of surface water.&#13;
However, runoff will increase due to urbanization. Curbs are unusually high and&#13;
the streets act as stormwater conduits. The risks of property damage and traffic&#13;
disruption will likely increase in the center of the city and in the western,&#13;
low-lying areas. Immediate corrective civil works have been identified, but a&#13;
comprehensive study will be carried out during the implementation of the project&#13;
to elaborate a stormwater drainage master plan.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
Background&#13;
3.01        Following a request from the Government of Turkey in March 1992, the&#13;
World Bank secured a Japanese grant of JY310.5 million for the preparation of the&#13;
Antalya Water Supply and Sanitation Project and of a solid waste management&#13;
project (para. 1.23). In November 1992, the contract for the feasibility study&#13;
was signed with a consortium of foreign and Turkish firms. The consultant's&#13;
report was issued in April 1994, and a World Bank mission visited Antalya in July&#13;
1994 to appraise the water and sanitation and the solid waste management&#13;
projects. Loan negotiations for both projects took place from March 20-23, 1995.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
3.02        The main objectives of the proposed project are:&#13;
(a)   to meet, at least cost, the demand for water supply, sewerage and&#13;
stormwater drainage;&#13;
(b)   to develop new institutional arrangements for the management of&#13;
municipal water supply, sewerage and stormwater drainage, and to&#13;
introduce private sector participation in the operation of the&#13;
services;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
(c)   to implement appropriate cost recovery policies to enhance self-&#13;
financing of water and sewerage services;&#13;
(d)   to postpone the need to develop costly new water resources by&#13;
improving the efficiency of utilization of existing sources and by&#13;
reducing the volume of non-revenue water which is presently too high&#13;
(46 percent); and&#13;
(e)   to improve and sustain environmental conditions and reduce health&#13;
hazards that threaten the local population and the tourism industry&#13;
by: (i) eliminating deficiencies in the collection and disposal of&#13;
municipal sewage; and (ii) improving stormwater drainage in areas&#13;
suffering seasonal flooding.&#13;
Approach to Project Preparation&#13;
3.03        The following principles guided the preparation of the proposed&#13;
project. First, to ensure sustainability, it was considered necessary to define&#13;
an institutional arrangement that would enjoy full support from the national and&#13;
municipal governments. Such arrangement should provide the necessary managerial,&#13;
technical and financial capabilities to achieve the required level of service&#13;
with full cost recovery at affordable prices. Second, the proposed institutional&#13;
arrangement should be replicable and serve as an example of self-financing in the&#13;
delivery of public services. Third, the Project should protect the environment,&#13;
promote sustainable use of natural resources, and strengthen the capacity of&#13;
local institutions to achieve these objectives. Fourth, the national water&#13;
quality objectives should be progressively reached within the framework of the&#13;
National Water Pollution Regulations (para. 1.17).&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
3.04        The September 1993 designation of Antalya as a metropolitan&#13;
municipality (Antalya Metropolitan Municipality - AMM) under Law No. 3030 had&#13;
important implications for the project. First, Law No. 3030 requires the&#13;
application of Law No. 2560 (the ISKI Law) for: (a) the development and operation&#13;
of public water supply, sewerage and stormwater drainage services, and (b) the&#13;
monitoring and control of liquid waste discharges and enforcing of water&#13;
pollution control regulation. Law No. 2560 requires the creation of an&#13;
autonomous water and sewerage authority under AMM (Annex 3.1). This entity&#13;
(Antalya Water Supply and Sewerage Authority - ASAT) was created in February 1995&#13;
by Decree 94/6516. And, second, under the Environmental Law 2872, AMM is&#13;
responsible for monitoring the quality of water supply, wastewater, sea and air&#13;
pollution in Antalya.&#13;
3.05        Project institutional arrangements (see organization chart in Annex&#13;
3.2) take into account the above laws. In addition, drawing on the lessons of&#13;
Bank experience cited above (paras. 1.19 and 1.20), they would limit the direct&#13;
involvement of AMM (and the DMs) in the day-to-day decision-making of service&#13;
provision, limit the size and role of ASAT in the project (para. 3.07), give&#13;
management responsibility to a commercially-oriented Sirket (para. 3.08) and give&#13;
operational responsibility to private operators under lease and management&#13;
contracts (para. 3.10). This would be a major step forward for the sector, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
high expectations are placed on private involvement as an instrument to improve&#13;
efficiency. The proposed institutional arrangement was the subject of a seminar&#13;
organized by AMM in Antalya, with the participation of the Bank, in May 1994.&#13;
This seminar was followed by a visit of representatives of AMM, DMs, Ministry of&#13;
Interior (MOI) and Treasury to privately-operated water and sanitation facilities&#13;
in France and the UK from May 29 to June 4, 1994.&#13;
3.06        ASAT.  The Antalya Water Supply and Bus Department (ASO) has been&#13;
dismantled and its assets and personnel have been transferred to ASAT and&#13;
AMM/DMs, respectively.  Contrary to similar institutions created in other&#13;
Metropolitan Municipalities, ASAT would remain very small. The number of&#13;
authorized positions is 19 but AMM will not fill all the authorized positions and&#13;
will limit the number of ASAT staff to a general manager, a deputy general&#13;
manager and three others required to complete the Board of Directors. This&#13;
arrangement provides the legal umbrella for the water supply, sewerage and&#13;
stormwater services.   While retaining its legal responsibility for service&#13;
provision, ASAT will delegate management of water supply, sewerage and stormwater&#13;
services to a Sirket (company incorporated under the commercial code). ASAT&#13;
would be a joint owner of the Sirket with AMM and the DMs. Further details on&#13;
the organization and structure of ASAT are found in Annex 3.3.&#13;
3.07        Sirket.  AMM, the DMs and ASAT will establish this commercial&#13;
enterprise as a means for consolidating administrative and financial management&#13;
of water supply, sewerage, stormwater and solid waste services and ensuring the&#13;
necessary commercially-oriented approach to service provision. Creation of the&#13;
Sirket will allow greater autonomy to sector management and will help to achieve&#13;
economies of scale. While the presence of ASAT and the proposed Sirket provide a&#13;
seemingly heavy structure, it is necessary under the law to have both entities.&#13;
As indicated above (para. 3.06), the heaviness of the structure will be&#13;
alleviated by keeping ASAT very small and by passing all administrative&#13;
responsibilities to the Sirket. To help ensure this efficient orientation, the&#13;
Board of Directors of the Sirket will include representatives of other important&#13;
agencies (e.g., DSI, Iller Bank) and of the private sector. The Sirket, with a&#13;
staff of ten professionals will manage, on behalf of AMM, the DMs and ASAT, the&#13;
bidding of civil works and equipment financed under the Project and will assure&#13;
supervision of such contracts. This ceiling of ten professionals has been agreed&#13;
at negotiations (para. 6.01 [a]). The Sirket will also provide billing,&#13;
accounting, contractor payment, preparation of withdrawal applications, reporting&#13;
and other administrative services to AMM, the DMs and ASAT.&#13;
3.08        The Sirket will engage the private operator for the water and&#13;
sewerage services. Bidding documents and draft contracts for the private&#13;
operator under lease and management contracts, will be prepared by a specialized&#13;
consultant (para. 3.10). The Sirket is expected to be assisted in its assignment&#13;
by a firm specialized in the management of water, sewerage and solid waste&#13;
services (preferably a twinning arrangement). This approach would maximize the&#13;
sense of responsibility and ownership as well as the self-financing effort of&#13;
AMM, the DMs and ASAT. It is expected also to result in a reduction of&#13;
dependency on Central government agencies, such as Iller Bank and DSI. It would&#13;
also minimize the bureaucratic and political constraints to which sector&#13;
institutions are typically exposed. The Sirket should be established before loan&#13;
effectiveness (para. 6.02 [a]). and its key staff be appointed not later than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
November 30. 1995 (para. 6.01 [c]). The technical assistance for the Sirket&#13;
would be contracted not later than April 30. 1996 (para. 6.01 [d]). At&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed that invitation for bids by private operator would&#13;
take place no later than October 31. 1995 on the basis of documentation&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank and that the private operator would be hired not later&#13;
than May 31, 1996 (para. 6.01 [b]). Further details on the structure and&#13;
operations of the Sirket are found in Annex 3.4.&#13;
3.09        Pro-ect Management Unit (PMU).  The PMU, which is already in place&#13;
reporting to the AMM Mayor, will assist AMM, the DMs and ASAT, as well as the&#13;
Sirket, in implementing the project for about one year (or less if appropriate)&#13;
after the signing of the contract with the private operator for the operation of&#13;
water supply and sewerage services.  The PMU will assist AMM, the DMs and ASAT&#13;
in: (i) setting up the Sirket, including selection of its personnel and technical&#13;
assistance (twinning arrangement - para. 3.08); and (ii) supervising the&#13;
preparation of the bidding documents for the selection of the private operator.&#13;
Until the Sirket is fully operational, the PMU will advise and assist ASAT in the&#13;
implementation of the project and recommend any actions to achieve the project&#13;
objectives, including the preparation of loan withdrawal applications and reports&#13;
on operational and financial progress. PMU will be assisted by a high-level&#13;
expert experienced in project management and familiar with the Bank's procurement&#13;
and disbursement procedures and guidelines. The recruitment of this expert is a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.02, [b]).&#13;
3.10        Private Operator.  A single private operator is expected to be&#13;
engaged under a single contract comprising a lease of the water supply system and&#13;
a management arrangement for the operation of the sewerage system. This operator&#13;
is expected to be a joint venture of an experienced international company and a&#13;
Turkish company. The operator will, under the lease and management contract: (a)&#13;
manage, operate and maintain all the water and sewerage facilities; (b) bill and&#13;
collect water and sewerage tariffs on behalf of ASAT/Sirket, retaining its&#13;
contractual share of revenues and remitting the balance to ASAT/Sirket; (c)&#13;
maintain detailed operating records and accounts and have the latter audited&#13;
annually by private auditors; and (d) provide water supply quality and sewage&#13;
treatment plant effluent test results. The private operator will not be&#13;
responsible for investments, either in terms of financing or construction.&#13;
ASAT/Sirket will be responsible for financing new investments and will engage&#13;
contractors and consultants to undertake the necessary civil works and&#13;
supervision. At negotiations it was agreed that as a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness ASAT will hire the consultants to assist in the preparation of&#13;
bidding documents. bid evaluation, and conduct negotiations for the Private&#13;
operator (para. 6.02 [c]).&#13;
Proiect Description&#13;
3.11        The Project comprises water supply, sewerage and stormwater&#13;
components, with ASAT as borrower. The Project represents the first phase, to be&#13;
implemented from 1995 through 2002, of the water supply and sewerage investment&#13;
program designed to continue to the year 2020. Future Bank lending for the&#13;
program may be considered, subject to satisfactory achievement of the policy and&#13;
institutional objectives proposed under this project.&#13;

Sirket managers and staff.&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
3.13        The total project cost is estimated at US$244.6 million equivalent&#13;
(Table 3.1). Civil works costs represent about 83 percent of base cost,&#13;
equipment about 4 percent, and services (including technical assistance) about 12&#13;
percent. Land acquisition costs account for the balance of project base cost.&#13;
Detailed project cost estimates are given in Annex 3.6, and summarized in Table&#13;
3.2.&#13;

3.14        Base costs are as of June 1994 and are based on recent bids for&#13;
similar projects. Local costs include about nine percent of taxes and duties.&#13;
Physical contingencies of 12 percent, cc-rering unforeseeable increases in&#13;
quantities, have been added to base costs (sea outfall: 15 percent), except for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
land. Because of high and volatile inflation in the Turkish economy and rapidly&#13;
changing exchange rates, base costs in Turkish lira have been converted into US&#13;
dollars. Price contingencies based on World Bank guidelines for international&#13;
price increases have been applied over the eight-year period of the project. The&#13;
escalation factors used are based on the latest Bank estimates (BP 6.50 of&#13;
October 1994).&#13;

Prolect Financing&#13;
3.15             The approach  to project  financing  is  to make  the activities  self-&#13;
supporting with no  contribution  to investment  costs  from AMM or the DMs.   ASAT&#13;
will fund the local counterpart to the Project from net revenues raised from&#13;
operations. To ensure that resources and effort would be focused on the proiect,&#13;
no investment over US$200.000 ecauivalent in cost would be undertaken by ASAT&#13;
without the prior concurrence by the Bank (para. 6.01 [el).&#13;
3.16             Based on the above  financing approach and project  characteristics,&#13;
the financing plan would be as shown in Table 3.3:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3.17        As shown in Table 3.3 above, World Bank financing of US$100.0 million&#13;
will amount to about 41 percent of total project cost.  The standard World Bank&#13;
loan terms for Turkey would apply:  17 years repayment, including five-years&#13;
grace period, at the standard variable interest rate. The Bank would finance&#13;
incremental recurring expenditures for the Sirket and the PMU (US$200,000 each)&#13;
for a limited period (until the end of August and November 1996, respectively).&#13;
The financing of the Sirket is required to cover its operating costs from the&#13;
initiation of operations until the flow of tariff-based income from the private&#13;
operator of the water and sewerage system becomes effective. The financing of&#13;
the PMU is required to substitute for the Japanese Grant until the Sirket is&#13;
fully operational. Retroactive financing in an amount of US$600,000 would be&#13;
provided to cover PMU expenditures after March 31, 1995.&#13;
3.18        The table above also shows the financing already approved by the&#13;
European Investment Bank (EIB). EIB loan will finance about 19 percent of the&#13;
project, covering approximately half the total cost of the wastewater treatment&#13;
plant and the entire cost of the sea outfall, as well as some sections of the&#13;
sewerage network. The EIB loan was approved in November 1994. The borrower is&#13;
the Government which will onlent to ASAT. The terms involve 20 years repayment,&#13;
including a five-year grace period, and a variable interest rate, currently four&#13;
percent.  Aqreement was reached at neqotiations that ASAT should confirm to the&#13;
Bank not later than December 1. 1995 that the EIB loan has become effective or,&#13;
if not, that other funds are available for the project to the borrower (para.&#13;
6.01 [f]).&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
3.19        The Project will be managed by the Sirket with assistance from the&#13;
PMU (paras. 3.06 through 3.09). Preparation of the bidding documents for the&#13;
civil works and supply of equipment is in progress under the Japanese grant&#13;
(para. 3.01), and bidding documents for selection of the private operator will be&#13;
issued by October 31, 1995 (para. 3.08). The lease and management contract for&#13;
water supply and sewerage is expected to be signed by May 1996 in order to allow&#13;
the future operator a say on project implementation. To formalize these&#13;
arrangements it was agreed at negotiations that ASAT will enter into a subsidiary&#13;
agreement with the Sirket on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank not&#13;
later than November 30, 1995 (para. 6.01 [g]). Tendering, bid evaluation and&#13;
award of contracts, including loan withdrawal applications, would be carried out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
by the Sirket with the assistance and supervision of PMU, and reviewed by the&#13;
Bank. Contracts for the first civil works would be signed in the first few&#13;
months of project implementation.&#13;
3.20        The Project will be implemented from 1995 through 2002.  The details&#13;
of the project implementation plan and programs of expenditures are in Annex 3.7.&#13;
The projected investment program takes into account Bank experience in the sector&#13;
in Turkey. The project completion date is December 31, 2002.&#13;
Land Acauisition&#13;
3.21        The site recommended by the consultants for the sewage treatment&#13;
plant would cover 25 ha of uninhabited agricultural land currently owned by many&#13;
private owners. The process for acquiring the land is well advanced. The land-&#13;
use implementation plan has been approved by Konaalti District Municipality and&#13;
the thirty-day public notice expired. There are no disputes pending regarding&#13;
the use of the land. Prior to loan effectiveness, ASAT should demonstrate that&#13;
all legal requirements for the acquisition of the land have been fulfilled and&#13;
there is no obstacle to the completion of the sewage treatment plant (para. 6.02&#13;
[d]).&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.22        Procurement arrangements for the Bank financed project elements,&#13;
their estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement are summarized in Table&#13;
3.4 below and in Annex 3.7. All goods and works to be financed from the Bank&#13;
loan proceeds would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement (January 1995), including amendments as of the loan signing date,&#13;
using the Country Standard Bidding Documents for Turkey. Consulting services&#13;
will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981),&#13;
including amendments as of the loan signing date.&#13;

3 .23         Civil Works/Supply and Installation.  An estimated US$119.2 million&#13;
equivalent of civil works, including supply and installation of water and sewer&#13;
pipes, will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) . An&#13;
estimated US$6.9 million equivalent of small civil works contracts are not&#13;
considered to be of interest to foreign bidders. The estimated value of these&#13;
contracts would range from US$660,000 to US$3 million and their aggregated amount&#13;
would be less than US$7 million; they would be procured through local competitive&#13;
bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. For procurement under NCB,&#13;
foreign bidders from the Bank's eligible countries would be allowed to&#13;
participate. For contracts procured through ICB, bidding documents following the&#13;
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Small Works (SBDSW) will be used. For the&#13;
contracts to be procured through NCB, the Standard Bidding Documents for National&#13;
Competitive Bidding will be used. For the supply and installation of equipment&#13;
for pumping stations (US$1 million), the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for&#13;
the Supply and Installation of Plant and Equipment will be used.&#13;
Prequalification of contractors would be used for large or complex civil works&#13;
contracts procured through ICB according to the World Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement Under IBRD loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, paras. 2.9 and 2.10).&#13;
To ensure the selection and hiring of qualified contractors under NCB, project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
supervision missions would agree with the Borrower on satisfactory and clearly&#13;
defined postqualification criteria.&#13;
3.24      Goods.  Goods and equipment (US$11.3 million) to be financed from the&#13;
Bank loan proceeds would consist of water meters, vehicles, computer systems, and&#13;
office equipment. As far as practicable, these will be packaged in such a manner&#13;
that all packages are large enough to attract international competition and at&#13;
the same time will contain packages suitable for attracting small manufacturers.&#13;
An estimated US$8.9 million equivalent of goods and equipment (estimated average&#13;
contract value US$250,000 equivalent) will be procured through ICB. Turkish&#13;
manufacturers competing for the contracts for the supply of goods procured under&#13;
ICB procedures will receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the&#13;
CIF price or the prevailing custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers,&#13;
whichever is less, provided they can prove to the satisfaction of the Borrower&#13;
and the Bank that the manufacturing cost of such goods includes more than 30% of&#13;
locally procured labour, raw materials and components. Furniture estimated to&#13;
cost the equivalent of US$125,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount&#13;
equivalent to US$125,000 will be procured through NCB using the Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for Procurement of Goods through NCB. International Shopping (IS),&#13;
based on comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers&#13;
from three eligible countries, will be used for procurement of some water meters&#13;
and computer software estimated to cost less than US$250,000, with an aggregate&#13;
limit of US$1.0 million. National Shopping (NS), based on comparison of price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three suppliers, will be used for procurement&#13;
of computer accessories estimated to cost less than US$50,000, with an aggregate&#13;
limit of US$300,000. Table 3.5 gives for each project component the number of&#13;
contracts to be procured through ICB and NCB and the range of contract value.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
for water supply and sewerage; stormwater drainage design and master planning;&#13;
base mapping for water supply; hydrogeological studies; preparation of bidding&#13;
documents for private operator; technical assistance for the Sirket would be&#13;
awarded on a competitive basis according to World Bank Guidelines. The remaining&#13;
consultant services, totalling about US$1.3 million, will involve the award of&#13;
contracts to individual consultants (for technical assistance for the PMU) and&#13;
ranging from several weeks to 13 months in duration.   Details of the nature and&#13;
cost of the consultant services are found in paras. 3.08 and 3.09 and in Annexes&#13;
3.5 and 3.6.&#13;
3.26       Country Procurement Assessment.  A Country Procurement Assessment&#13;
Report (CPAR) which was completed in 1985 is presently being updated. Laws and&#13;
regulations regarding local procurement procedures and practices in Turkey are&#13;
being reviewed by the Bank in order to reach judgement as to whether local&#13;
procedures are acceptable for Bank-financed contracts. The findings of that&#13;
review will be discussed with Turkish authorities and agreement will be reached&#13;
regarding any changes needed to make procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Furthermore, ASAT will use the Standard Bidding Documents for the procurement&#13;
through NCB.&#13;
3.27       All contracts awarded through NCB in excess of US$1 million, all&#13;
contracts awarded through ICB, and contracts for technical assistance and&#13;
consultancy services valued in excess of US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals will be subject to prior Bank review. This limit will result in&#13;
prior review of about 95 percent of total procurement. Contracts for lesser&#13;
amounts will be subject to ex-post review. Also, terms of reference for all&#13;
technical assistance and consultancy contracts will be reviewed in advance by the&#13;
Bank. ASAT will promptly inform Bank staff regarding procurement plans,&#13;
solicitations, proposed contract awards and progress in the implementation of its&#13;
procurement activities. Contracting and purchase actions will also be summarized&#13;
in periodic submissions of operations reports prepared for the Bank by ASAT&#13;
(initially prepared by PMU and later by Sirket).&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
3.28       The proposed allocation of the proceeds from the loan is shown in&#13;
Annex 3.08. The Bank loan will finance:&#13;
(a)   civil works:  54 percent of expenditures;&#13;
(b)   goods:  55 percent of expenditures;&#13;
(c)   consultants' services: 100 percent of expenditures; and&#13;
(d)   incremental recurrent costs: 100 percent of expenditures for the&#13;
Sirket through August 31, 1996; 100 percent of expenditures for the&#13;
PMU through November 30, 1996.&#13;
3.29    Retroactive financing in an amount of US$600,000 would be provided to&#13;
cover PMU expenditures made after March 31, 1995.  Loan withdrawal applications&#13;
will be prepared by the PMU and the Sirket for ASAT.  These will be fully&#13;
documented, except for expenditures against contracts valued at less than: (i)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2 3&#13;
US$1,000,000 for goods and works; (ii) US$100,000 for consulting firms; and (iii)&#13;
US$50,000 for individual consultation, which will be made on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures detailing the individual transactions. Documentation&#13;
supporting these expenditures will be retained by the implementing entity for at&#13;
least the duration of the project.&#13;
3.30    To facilitate payments from the loan, ASAT will establish a Special&#13;
Account in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank or in the Central Bank. The&#13;
account will have a maximum allocation of US$4 million, but until the pace of&#13;
activity in the project justifies a balance of this size, defined as when the&#13;
total of withdrawals from the loan account plus the value of any special&#13;
commitments made against the loan are equal to US$10 million, the maximum balance&#13;
in the Special Account shall be US$1 million. Documented applications for&#13;
replenishment of the Special Account will be submitted every three months, or&#13;
when two-thirds of the amount deposited has been withdrawn, whichever occurs&#13;
earlier. Monthly bank statements of the Special Accounts, reconciled by the&#13;
Sirket, will accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;
3.31    The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 3.6 below.&#13;
The project will be implemented over a seven-and-a-half-year period while&#13;
disbursements will extend through eight years. The projected disbursement&#13;
pattern differs from the standard disbursement profile for the sector in Turkey&#13;
in duration (eight years instead of ten years) and in the amount of disbursement&#13;
in the early years of the project (higher in the project schedule than in the&#13;
profile). However, it differs only slightly from the Bank-wide sector profile in&#13;
disbursements in the early years (ten percent in the first year compared to six&#13;
percent in the Bank-wide profile) while being seven percent longer (six months)&#13;
in duration. The loan closing date is June 30, 2003. The estimated schedule of&#13;
disbursement is given in Annex 3.9.&#13;

project expenditures. The project accounts and the Sirket operational accounts&#13;
will be audited annually by independent private auditors, according to terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank. The Special Account will be audited by&#13;
Government auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit reports will contain a&#13;
separate opinion on the use of Statements of Expenditures. Audit reports in&#13;
English will be forwarded to the Bank not later than six months after the end of&#13;
each fiscal year. During negotiations, agreement was reached to have all these&#13;
above-mentioned accounts audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 6.01&#13;
[hi).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
3.33        The Sirket, under the guidance of the PMU and on behalf of ASAT, will&#13;
provide quarterly reports to the Bank on progress of project implementation.&#13;
These reports will include a summary of implementation status; the Sirket's&#13;
financial statements including the Special Account; a description of progress on&#13;
restructuring the water and sewerage services; and data on their performance&#13;
indicators. Included in these reports will also be procurement information such&#13;
as: (a) contract award information; (b) revised cost estimates for individual&#13;
contracts and the total project cost; and (c) revised implementation schedule.&#13;
The Sirket will prepare an Implementation Completion Report and submit it to the&#13;
Bank six months after the closing date of the loan.  Durinq neqotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached on reporting recquirements (para. 6.01 [i]).&#13;
Supervision&#13;
3.34        Intensive Bank supervision will be needed because the Project has&#13;
significant policy and institutional requirements. Much of the day-to-day&#13;
supervision will be carried out by the Sirket assisted by the PMU, but intensive&#13;
Bank supervision of the Sirket will be required particularly in the early years,&#13;
during which time the technical assistance will be made operational and most of&#13;
the procurement contracts will have been awarded. Field supervision would take&#13;
place at least three times each year. Supervision requirements would be 5&#13;
staff-weeks in 1995, 25 staff-weeks in 1996, and 15 each year during the period&#13;
1997 to 2003, for a total of 135 staff-weeks. A Project Launch Workshop will&#13;
also be organized, along with a training seminar in procurement, disbursement and&#13;
accounts/audits soon after loan signature. Supervision cost economies will be&#13;
sought by relying as much as possible on the Bank Resident Mission for&#13;
consultations. Costs for follow-on projects should decline as the Sirket gains&#13;
experience in investment planning and implementation and Bank procedures. Each&#13;
supervision mission should normally include a sanitary engineer and a financial&#13;
analyst.&#13;
Annual Project Review&#13;
3.35        An annual review, between the Bank, ASAT and the Sirket, to assess&#13;
progress and problems towards achieving the objectives of the Project and to&#13;
consider further actions needed for this purpose, will take place before September&#13;
30 of each year. Agreement on this review was reached at negotiations (para. 6.01&#13;
[j]). The review of financial aspects of the project should focus on the results of&#13;
the previous four quarters of operation. The Bank financing for the water supply&#13;
and sewerage investment program for the coming year will be adjusted to match the&#13;
extent to which financial self-sufficiency (para. 4.06) is achieved or sustained.&#13;
IV. FINANCE&#13;
Past Financial Performance and Current Financial Position&#13;
4.01        The financial condition and performance of the Municipality's water&#13;
operations cannot be determined with accuracy since ASO has been a municipal&#13;
department with an accounting system which does not record asset values or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2 5&#13;
properly distinguish between water and transport revenues and expenditures.&#13;
However, it has been possible to estimate the results of water operations, to&#13;
extrapolate asset and liability values and to establish trends over the last&#13;
several years, thereby permitting an assessment of the pre-project condition and&#13;
performance of ASO.&#13;
4.02        At the end of 1993, ASO had a substantial asset base (estimated at&#13;
about US$38 million) and a relatively small, TL-denominated debt with DSI and&#13;
Iller Bank of about US$10 million equivalent. While debt has increased 3 times&#13;
since 1991 (due to a Iller Bank-financed sewerage project), the debt/equity ratio&#13;
at the beginning of 1994 was reasonable at 25 percent.&#13;
4.03        ASO's financial performance has been generally weak, with losses in&#13;
each of the last three years resulting in a deterioration of cash flow that was&#13;
worsened by the Municipality's practice of using ASO's cash for other purposes.&#13;
A more detailed look at ASO's historical performance shows decreases in water&#13;
sales revenue over the last three years while personnel expenditures increased.&#13;
The latter averaged about 85 percent of water sales and about 68 percent of total&#13;
operating costs, unacceptably high percentages that account for the very low&#13;
levels of maintenance and repair expenditures that the Municipality was able to&#13;
afford.&#13;
Project Financial Approach&#13;
4.04        Water supply and wastewater services will be fully self-supporting,&#13;
with cost-based tariffs chargeable to the users of these services. However,&#13;
initially significant loan financing is necessary to supplement internally-&#13;
generated funds as project investments are substantial. This financing scheme&#13;
will require substantial tariff increases. There will be no direct recovery of&#13;
stormwater costs which will be covered by sewerage tariffs. No AMM/DMs&#13;
contributions will be required to support ASAT's project and operations.&#13;
4.05        The operator of the water supply, sewerage and stormwater systems&#13;
should recover their costs from three different sources: (a) contractually-&#13;
defined charges (which form part of the tariff) to cover recurrent costs arising&#13;
from operating the systems and providing the services (personnel, energy, general&#13;
maintenance, chemicals and other consumables); (b) contractually-defined&#13;
assessments (participation fees) to direct beneficiaries of investments in the&#13;
water and sewerage systems; and (c) contractually-defined connection fees,&#13;
penalties and charges for repair and maintenance.  The operator would be&#13;
contractually recruired to periodically adjust water and sewerage charges and fees&#13;
according to the Consumer Price Index or other index acceptable to the Bank to&#13;
compensate for inflation. This was agreed at negotiations (para. 6.01 [k]). The&#13;
operator's charges should form part of the tariff.  Other elements of the tariff,&#13;
to be set by ASAT, should comprise ASAT's own operating costs (which would be&#13;
minor), Sirket costs, ASAT's debt service, and ASAT's contribution to investment.&#13;
The tariff and other fees and charges will be billed and collected by the private&#13;
operator. After retaining their contractual share of collected tariffs and other&#13;
revenues, the private operator should remit to ASAT/Sirket the balance of&#13;
revenues, including participation fees, which should cover ASAT and Sirket&#13;
operating needs, debt service and investment obligations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
4.06        In January 1994, the average water tariff was equivalent to about&#13;
US$0.44/m3 equivalent, with an increase to US$0.63/mr3 equivalent (June 1994&#13;
average exchange rate US$1 = TL 31,162) effective from July 1, 1994. The&#13;
increase was approved by AMM Assembly in July 1994. The average tariffs, as&#13;
envisioned in the feasibility study during the implementation of the project,&#13;
are: 1995-US$0.53; 1996-US$0.67; 1997 to 2000-US$0.85; and 2001 to 2002-US$0.91.&#13;
Agreement was reached at negotiations on the following criteria for tariff&#13;
setting: ASAT would implement ciuarterlv tariff adjustments for its services to&#13;
ensure that they are sufficient to cover (a) ASAT/Sirket operating costs; (b) the&#13;
operating cost of the private operator as set in the lease and management&#13;
contract; (c) a reasonable contribution to investment; and (d) debt service&#13;
(para. 6.01 [1]). The required contribution to investment is to be agreed, at&#13;
the annual review meeting (para. 3.35) so as to ensure that planned investments&#13;
are fully funded, and consistent with the project implementation schedule. The&#13;
operating cost of the private operator would vary according to inflation and&#13;
other variables as determined by the operator's lease and management contracts.&#13;
AMM Assembly has provided evidence of its agreement to the principles of autonomy&#13;
and financial self-sufficiency of water supply and sewerage operations.&#13;
4.07        For the customers connected to the sewerage network, a tariff equal&#13;
to 100 percent of the water tariff (the maximum sewerage charge permitted under&#13;
Turkish law) will be charged, beginning in 1998 when the first parts of the&#13;
sewerage system are commissioned. The calculation of the sewerage tariff should&#13;
follow the same criteria for water supply as would the adjustment of the tariff.&#13;
4.08        By law, all property owners benefitting from extensions or&#13;
improvements to the water network are required to "participate" in investment&#13;
costs. The participation fees are set by the Municipality based on declared&#13;
property values, as stipulated by the Municipal Revenues Law (No. 2464 of May&#13;
1981). Thus, under the Project, AMM would assess and collect participation fees&#13;
from all connected properties (95 percent of the population is currently served&#13;
by the water network) for the extension and rehabilitation of the water network.&#13;
For sewerage, participation fees would be collected only from properties to be&#13;
connected to the planned sewer network (about 50 percent of the population is to&#13;
be served by the sewer network by the end of the Project). Participation fees&#13;
have not been used in Antalya in recent years to help finance water network&#13;
improvements. Such fees have been used in the case of road improvements, but&#13;
generally have not been a significant source of financing as the fees have&#13;
typically been low (due both to low fee rates set by the Municipality and to low&#13;
declared property values) and have not been subject to adjustment for inflation&#13;
or interest during the payment period.&#13;
Future Finances and Project Financing Plan&#13;
4.09        ASAT/Sirket's financial requirements have been assessed taking into&#13;
account projected investment over the seven-and-a-half-year period of the project&#13;
(1995 to 2002). ASAT/Sirket is expected to adopt and implement sound operational&#13;
and financial policies which should enable the utility to: (a) improve the&#13;
quality of service and asset operation and maintenance practices; (b) internally&#13;
generate funds to finance the local counterpart funds required for project&#13;
investments; and (c) service local and foreign exchange-denominated debt (for the&#13;
proposed Bank and EIB loans).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
4.10        ASAT/Sirket's total operating revenues are expected to gradually&#13;
increase from about US$7 million equivalent in 1993 to US$8 million in 1994, and&#13;
US$10 million in 1995 and continue increasing during the project period to US$42&#13;
million in 2002. To generate the required revenues and to contain costs, the&#13;
following assumptions have been used in the financial calculations:&#13;
(a)   total water sales will be increased from 17 million m3 in 1993 to 19&#13;
million m3 in 1995 and to 28 million m3 in 2002;&#13;
(b)   collection performance (collection ratio) will improve from an&#13;
average of 80 percent (for 1991-93) to 82 percent in 1996 and will&#13;
continue to improve by two percent annual increments to 90 percent in&#13;
2000 and by one percent increments to 92 percent in 2002;&#13;
(c)   labor productivity will improve from 3.5 employees/1,000 water&#13;
connections in 1993 to 2.5 in 1995 and 1.8 thereafter;&#13;
(d)   average tariffs for water supply will increase from US$0.46/mr3&#13;
equivalent in 1993 to US$0.53/mr3 in 1995, US$0.67/m3 in 1996,&#13;
US$0.85/m3 from 1997 to 2000, and US$0.91/m3 in 2001 and thereafter;&#13;
(e)   sewerage tariffs will be introduced in 1998 at levels equal to water&#13;
tariffs, resulting in total water and sewerage average tariffs of&#13;
US$1.70/m3 from 1998 to 2000 and US$1.82/mi3 in 2001 and thereafter.&#13;
4.11        The above operational improvements, resulting primarily from the&#13;
actions of the private operator, will be reflected in ASAT's financial&#13;
performance. Profitability (net income as a percentage of equity), which is&#13;
expected to be negative three percent in 1994, would become positive in 1996 and&#13;
would average about three percent in the second half of the implementation&#13;
period. ASAT's contribution to investment (self-financing ratio) would improve&#13;
from two percent in 1994 to 10 percent in 1996, 30 percent in 1998, and would&#13;
average 15 percent over the implementation period. Indebtedness (debt/equity&#13;
ratio) would increase, from 0.33 in 1994 to a high of 0.53 in 2000 and 2001&#13;
before declining to 0.51 in 2002. ASAT's performance in meeting these targets&#13;
would be reviewed at the annual project review (para. 3.38). Past financial&#13;
performance of ASO water operations and projected future performance of ASAT&#13;
water and sewerage operations are detailed in Annex 4.1.&#13;
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION AND RISKS&#13;
Proiect Benefits&#13;
5.01        The Project approach supports the Government's decentralization&#13;
objective by shifting investment responsibility from the government budget to the&#13;
Municipality, which in turn, will recover costs through user charges. In&#13;
addition, the Project will: (a) promote managerial efficiency and improve service&#13;
quality through new institutional arrangements that would introduce private&#13;
sector participation in the operation of the water supply and sewerage; (b)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
reduce health hazards to the local and tourist population; and (c) improve&#13;
environmental conditions.&#13;
5.02        The water component will increase water supply to the growing&#13;
population, which is already experiencing water shortages, and improve delivery&#13;
by maintaining network pressure at all times. Water consumption is expected to&#13;
increase from 22 million m3 in 1994 to 32 million m3 in 2002, and water sold is&#13;
expected to increase from 18 million m3 in 1994 to 28 million m3 in 2002.  Water&#13;
connections will increase from about 143,000 in 1994 to about 212,000 in 2002, by&#13;
which time service coverage will reach 96 percent. By the year 2002, sewerage&#13;
would be available to about 400,000 households, or about 50 percent of the&#13;
population. The network will be built mostly in the western part of the city,&#13;
where the water table is high and construction of septic tanks is not feasible,&#13;
and will extend to the north to protect the main water supply sources.&#13;
Improvements in public health will occur through reduction of potential of&#13;
drinking water contamination. Lack of reliable epidemiological studies makes it&#13;
difficult to quantify this benefit. The construction of the drainage facilities&#13;
will reduce the incidence of flooding in Antalya.&#13;
5.03        The proposed investments and technical assistance will strengthen&#13;
efficiency, financial viability, service quality, capacity to plan and implement&#13;
investments, and accountability to local consumers. Non-revenue water is&#13;
expected to decrease from 46 percent in 1994 to 36 percent in 2002. Through the&#13;
leasing arrangement, the number of employees is expected to be reduced&#13;
significantly, from 3.5 employees/1,000 connections to 1.8 employees/1,000&#13;
connections.&#13;
Least Cost Solution&#13;
5.04        The most economical alternative to meet the water demand has been&#13;
selected. This involves rehabilitation and extension of existing facilities&#13;
(well fields, pumping stations and network) and reduction of unaccounted-for-&#13;
water. In addition, optimal use of groundwater would postpone the construction&#13;
of the large-diameter water supply pipe from the Karacaoren Dam and water&#13;
treatment plant proposed by DSI until after 2020. For the sewerage network, only&#13;
the first phase which will serve about 50 percent of the population is&#13;
financially feasible. For the sewage treatment plant, a phased approach has been&#13;
adopted.&#13;
Rate of Return&#13;
5.05        The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the project has been calculated&#13;
using the incremental water and sewerage revenues as a proxy of the benefits&#13;
attributable to the investments. The average selling price which would apply in&#13;
1998, the year major project-financed water and sewerage investments are expected&#13;
to be operational (US$1.70/m3 at 1994 prices), has been taken in order to&#13;
calculate the revenues. The use of actual price charged as a proxy for benefits&#13;
is conservative since a high proportion of consumers would be willing to pay more&#13;
than this for essential water supply. The cost and benefit streams used to&#13;
calculate the IRR include the capital and operating costs, and benefits related&#13;
to investments additional to the project in order to meet the water and sewerage&#13;
demand up to 2020. All costs are at June 1994 market prices and exclude taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Adjustment to border prices is not feasible for lack of data. The resultant rate&#13;
of return is 9.3 percent (Annex 5.1) and would range from 5.2 percent to 14.0&#13;
percent if costs and benefits were to be increased or decreased by 20 percent.&#13;
These rates of return, while lower than generally calculated for infrastructure&#13;
projects, are not unusual for water supply and sewerage projects. In this sector,&#13;
the actual returns to the economy, should also include those derived from&#13;
improved health and environmental conditions, and hence would substantially&#13;
exceed the returns derived from tariffs paid by the consumers. However, these&#13;
health and environmental benefits are impossible to quantify based on the&#13;
available data and are not included in the calculation of the rate of return.&#13;
The risk of occurence of the lower range of rates of return from the sensitivity&#13;
analysis is mitigated by contractual guarantees and loan conditionality which&#13;
safeguard the revenues on which benefits are based from shortfalls and from cost&#13;
increases through automatic tariff increases to reflect actual costs, operational&#13;
experience and inflation.&#13;
Affordability&#13;
5.06        Tariffs to residential customers will vary with consumption, and the&#13;
lowest (subsidized) tariff would apply to customers consuming up to 10 m3/month.&#13;
This low tariff level is intended to provide households with enough water to&#13;
satisfy basic needs and maintain minimum health and sanitary conditions. The&#13;
lowest tariff for water consumption in 1994 was US$0.32/m3 and in 2002 it is&#13;
projected at about US$0.50/mr3.  If the household is connected to the sewage&#13;
network, the tariff doubles, representing an amount of about two percent of the&#13;
monthly income of the households in the lowest income groups. This is well&#13;
within the five percent range of acceptability, by Bank standards, for water and&#13;
sanitation.&#13;
Poverty and Gender Impact&#13;
5.07        In 2002, 96 percent of the population would be connected to the water&#13;
network with about 60,000 new beneficiary households having been added, including&#13;
about 12,000 additional low income residents. In addition, the quality of the&#13;
water supply and distribution would be significantly improved. It has been&#13;
documented worldwide that lack of access to water tends to pose a greater burden&#13;
on women, so the gender impact of the project is also expected to be positive.&#13;
All the population would indirectly benefit from the construction of the new&#13;
sewerage network.&#13;
Risks&#13;
5.08        Project risks relate to: (a) the challenge of setting up, for the&#13;
first time in Turkey, lease and management arrangements for the operation of&#13;
public utilities; (b) the Sirket's institutional and financial capacity to carry&#13;
out a large investment program in view of potential political interference by AMM&#13;
and the Ministry of Interior; (c) the willingness of municipal authorities to&#13;
maintain cost recovery measures necessary to assure affordability and self-&#13;
financing; (d) the ability of Iller Bank and DSI to complete their investments&#13;
within the expected time; and (e) the time required to complete land acquisition.&#13;
To mitigate these risks, substantial up-front actions have taken place: (i) a&#13;
seminar was held in May 1994 to discuss private sector participation as an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
instrument to improve efficiency in the operation of public services; and (ii) a&#13;
visit of representatives of AMM, DMs, Ministry of Interior and Treasury was&#13;
organized in May-June 1994 to privately-operated water and sanitation facilities&#13;
in France and the UK. In addition the project includes: (i) substantial&#13;
technical assistance; (ii) commitments from Iller Bank and DSI to the objectives&#13;
of the project; and (iii) a commitment from AMM to complete land acquisition&#13;
before loan effectiveness. Another risk relates to securing the full financing&#13;
required; this would be contained by requiring ASAT to secure that EIB financing,&#13;
which has already been approved, becomes effective by December 1, 1995, or to&#13;
come up with alternative financing arrangements satisfactory to the Bank and by&#13;
the proposed event of default (para. 3.18).&#13;
Environmental Considerations&#13;
5.09        The Project has been reviewed and classified in Environmental&#13;
Screening Category "B", consistent with the provisions of the Operational&#13;
Directive 4.01, Annex E "Environmental Assessment". Preliminary environmental&#13;
analysis of the components has been carried out to identify benefits, examine&#13;
potential negative impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed (see&#13;
Project File). Analyses consistent with the requirements for Category "B"&#13;
projects were undertaken during the preparation of the Project and the&#13;
feasibility study took into account the needed assessment and control of&#13;
detrimental effects of the marine outfall for the treated effluent from the&#13;
wastewater treatment plant. The Ministry of Environment has approved the&#13;
environmental assessment as prepared in the feasibility study. Satisfactory&#13;
designs would be submitted to the Ministry of Environment and the Bank for&#13;
approval before tendering. Civil works contracts will include appropriate&#13;
requirements to ensure that the works are carried out in such way as to minimize&#13;
any negative environmental effects. There are no resettlement issues and no dam&#13;
construction in the Project.&#13;
5.10        The Project strives to protect the unique environmental conditions of&#13;
Antalya, benefitting the local population and the tourism industry by: (a)&#13;
protecting and improving underground water quality through construction of&#13;
sewerage; and (b) improving water distribution and easing pressure on the water&#13;
sources by reducing water losses.&#13;
5.11        The sewage treatment plant Sjcations for the west and the east sides&#13;
were identified and incorporated in the Antalya urban development master plan&#13;
many years ago. The locations were confirmed by the feasibility studies&#13;
undertaken by the consulting firm hired for the preparation of the project. The&#13;
sites are not inhabited. The western location is used for mixed agriculture and&#13;
grazing, and procedures for its acquisition by the Municipality are well advanced&#13;
(para. 3.21). The site is large enough to protect the neighbors against the&#13;
potential odor. The eastern location, which is not part of the Project, is owned&#13;
by the Forestry Department, and the Municipality has already made a request for&#13;
its acquisition.&#13;
5.12        The measures planned to mitigate the project environmental impacts&#13;
are summarized in Annex 5.2.&#13;
&#13;

elevated reservoirs (20,000 m3 and 10,000 m3 in zone III, and two 5,000 m3 in&#13;
zone IV and V, respectively). The pumping station and the water mains are&#13;
completed and the reservoirs are under construction according to the new&#13;
proposed consultant TBS design. Full benefit from DSI investment would be&#13;
achieved only if the distribution network is extended and partly replaced,&#13;
which is the aim of the proposed project.&#13;

Sewerage--Existing Facilities&#13;
Installations constructed prior to 1975 are mostly equipped with single-&#13;
compartment pits dug in the travertine, with or without a zerzemin (soakage pit).&#13;
Most of the buildings constructed after 1975 are equipped with concrete septic&#13;
tanks, often of single-compartment type, although it was not an obligation at the&#13;
time. During the last 10 years, in order to conform with a Ministry of Health and&#13;
Social Works' regulation, septic tanks have had to be built to serve facilities&#13;
within 1,000 m of potable water sources or 500 m of the sea. This regulation&#13;
involves all buildings in Antalya since potable water is drawn up from the&#13;
underlying travertine. Owners are required to improve their sanitation facilities&#13;
whenever they ask for removal of septage. Since 1985, a total of about 7,200 modern&#13;
septic tanks have been built. At present, about 70 percent of the population is&#13;
served by some kind of concrete septic tank. The newly recommended concrete septic&#13;
tank is multi-compartment (generally three to four compartments) and is combined&#13;
with a traditional zerzemin of a small-diameter 20 m to 40 m deep-borehole for&#13;
percolating the effluent. Design criteria of one m3/c for a maximum of 100 persons&#13;
is appropriate, but not always applied during construction.&#13;
Disposal facilities receive not only domestic wastewater but also some&#13;
of the rainwater falling on the property, either directly into the septic tank or&#13;
into the zerzemin. Because it often is not protected by a screening device, solids&#13;
such as papers, plastics and other floating materials clog the zerzemin or the&#13;
underground channels. Although such facilities should be desludged on a yearly&#13;
basis (Iller Bank Regulation 1986), this in fact occurs only when odors indicate&#13;
that the zerzemin is clogged and the septic tank overflows. The system is then&#13;
cleaned with acid, which damages the travertine, or a new zerzernin is built.&#13;
Institutional and educational buildings (four hospitals, 129 schools),&#13;
except the university and the electricity company (TEK), have septic tanks, although&#13;
their load exceeds the design capacity of 100 persons as mentioned above.&#13;
Industrial activities have not developed, except for one ferro-chrome&#13;
and one battery factory. The construction materials industry developed in the early&#13;
eighties, in response to tourism development and the rapid population increase.&#13;
Most of the industries are located along the important access roads from the north&#13;
(Burdur-Ankara) and the east (Airport-Alanya) in four organized industrial zones of&#13;
370 ha, 120 ha, 32 ha, and 40 ha, respectively. The 370 ha and 120 ha industrial&#13;
zones, including the sewerage system, are under construction. The 32 ha zone is&#13;
served by a sewerage system draining the effluent into a large buried settling tank&#13;
that allows infiltration into the ground through three boreholes. The 40 ha duty-&#13;
free zone, near the port, is newly opened and is fully served by a sewerage system&#13;
&#13;

and a biological wastewater treatment plant (capacity about 3,000 P.E.). Except&#13;
for nine factories that have some kind of a pre-treatment, almost all scattered&#13;
industries merely have septic tanks with soaking pits or boreholes.&#13;
Tourism activities are served by large hotels and "pensions" (31) and holiday&#13;
camps (seven). Twenty-eight of these facilities are equipped with biological&#13;
wastewater treatment and ten have only septic tanks.&#13;

ANTALYA METROPOLITAN MUNICIPALITY&#13;
Municipal Structure&#13;
The responsibilities are exercised through an institutional structure&#13;
which consists of the Municipal Council, an Executive Committee of Members, and&#13;
the Mayor as Head of the executive employees. In September 1993, the&#13;
Municipality of Antalya was granted the status of Metropolitan Municipality under&#13;
Law No. 3030. As a result, the Antalya Municipality receives a portion of the&#13;
nine percent national tax revenues which are distributed on the pro rata of the&#13;
population by Iller Bank. The elevation of the Antalya municipality to&#13;
metropolitan status established three new district municipal authorities, each&#13;
with a mayor, council and administration. These new district municipalities have&#13;
responsibilities for solid waste collection and street cleaning. Law No. 2560&#13;
requires the creation of an autonomous and self-financing water and sewerage&#13;
company under AMM. This entity was created in February 1995 by Decree 94/65/6&#13;
(Annex 3.3). Until the private operator is engaged, the personnel of ASO (former&#13;
water department) and Environmental Health Department (former sewerage&#13;
department) will remain as personnel of the Municipality.&#13;
The Municipal Council/General Assemblv&#13;
The Council consists of 38 elected members who serve for a five-year&#13;
period. Its function is to determine policy for the provision of the various&#13;
local services.&#13;
The Executive Committee&#13;
The Committee is chaired by the Mayor and is composed of members&#13;
elected of the Municipal Council, together with the head of municipal&#13;
departments. The Committee meets twice weekly to review the policy, monitor&#13;
operational and financial performance and examine administrative matters.&#13;
The Mayor&#13;
The Mayor is the institutional head and chief executive of the&#13;
Municipality. He is elected for a five-year period. He is required to ratified&#13;
all decisions of the Municipal Council. As chief executive, the Mayor has the&#13;
responsibility to implement the Council's policies. To manage the municipal&#13;
departments, he appoints six non-elected Vice-Mayors who have few departments&#13;
reporting to them.&#13;

Personnel&#13;
The Municipality has a staff of 2,400 employees on a permanent basis.&#13;
About 380 are subject to Public Employee Law and have "civil service" terms and&#13;
conditions; the remaining 2,020 are subject to Union Law and have "general&#13;
worker" terms and conditions.&#13;

Antalva Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (ASAT)&#13;
Governing Entities&#13;
According to Law No. 2560, ASAT would be governed by:&#13;
o a General Assembly consisting of the Metropolitan Municipal Council;&#13;
o a Board of Directors consisting of the Mayor, as the chairman of the&#13;
Board, the General Director, as the vice-chairman of the Board, and&#13;
three municipal appointees nominated on a part-time basis mainly to sit&#13;
at Board meetings; and&#13;
o a General Director, who is appointed by the Ministry of Interior upon&#13;
nomination by the Mayor and, as the chief executive officer, is&#13;
responsible for the day-to-day operations of ASAT.&#13;
The General Assembly, which consists of 38 elected members who serve for a&#13;
five-year term, will approve ASAT's investment plans, operating budgets, tariffs,&#13;
borrowing and staffing prepared by the Sirket.&#13;
The Board of Directors will approve matters proposed by the Sirket before&#13;
being submitted to the General Assembly.&#13;
The General Director will implement the decisions of the General Assembly&#13;
and the Board of Directors and manage the day-to-day activities of ASAT.&#13;
ASAT's staffing plan, remuneration levels and personnel regulations are&#13;
approved by the Ministry of Interior.&#13;
ASAT's accounts will be maintained by the Sirket and will be audited&#13;
annually by independent accredited auditors approved by the Bank.&#13;
Main Issues&#13;
The autonomy of the Board has to be improved. Political influence&#13;
still takes precedence in the determination of the financial and operational&#13;
policies and the central government has control over manpower planning and levels&#13;
of remuneration. Such issues have to be addressed if cost-effective services to&#13;
customers are to be achieved.&#13;

SIRKET&#13;
Rationale for a Sirket&#13;
The past performance of the Antalya municipal departments, together with&#13;
the less than fully successful experience of the organizations created under the&#13;
ISKI Law in other metropolitan municipalities, help explain the decision of AMM&#13;
to contract out the operation of the water supply and sewerage services to the&#13;
private sector under lease (affermage) and management arrangements. The proposed&#13;
Sirket is needed to supervise the operation of the services under the private&#13;
operator and to enforce the provisions of the lease contract, ensuring that the&#13;
operator complies with all its commitments. The Sirket, incorporated under the&#13;
Turkish Trade Law, is not subject to staff regulations of the Ministry of&#13;
interior and the Law 657 on civil servants, but is regulated by the general Labor&#13;
Law 1475 which applies to private enterprises. Management and remuneration of&#13;
its personnel is only subject to the directives of the Board.&#13;
Governing Entities&#13;
The Sirket is expected to be incorporated as soon as possible following the&#13;
creation of ASAT. The Sirket will be owned by AMM, the DMs and ASAT. The Board&#13;
of Directors will comprise representatives of AMM (1), DMs (3), ASAT (1),&#13;
Sirket's Director General (1), DSI (1), Iller Bank (1), local chamber of Commerce&#13;
and Industries (1), local chamber of Artisans and Craftsman (1), and the&#13;
Association of Tourism (1). Each representative will have an equal voting power.&#13;
Boards members would not be appointed on a full time basis.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
The 565 employees of the municipal water supply and sewerage department&#13;
(ASO), the 54 employees of the Environmental Health Department responsible for&#13;
emptying the septic tanks, and the 314 employees of the municipal Cleaning Works&#13;
Department responsible for solid waste collection and disposal and street&#13;
cleaning, will remain with AMM, but only some of them will be transferred to the&#13;
DMs. The services will continue to be managed by AMM. When the private operator&#13;
is selected, the employees will have the choice to work with the private operator&#13;
or remain with AMM or the DMs. The private operator is expected to absorb about&#13;
50 percent of the previously mentioned employees. Sirket staff should not exceed&#13;
ten professional employees as agreed during negotiations. All professional&#13;
positions will be advertised and a special committee will be responsible for the&#13;
selection of the candidates. The operator under contract with the Sirket will&#13;
confront the Sirket staff with enforcement and control issues for which there is&#13;
no precedent in Turkey. Technical assistance from a single firm, specialized in&#13;

the management of such services (twinning arrangement), is therefore essential&#13;
and will be provided by the proposed project.&#13;
Planning and Information Systems&#13;
The Sirket would be an autonomous company. It will have the overall&#13;
management responsibility for the development of the services, including physical&#13;
and financial planning and construction, while the private operator will be&#13;
responsible for the operation of the services, including maintenance and repair&#13;
of the physical assets. The information systems for managing operational and&#13;
commercial activities and reporting on overall financial results (accounting&#13;
system) will be shared by the Sirket and the private operator. The Sirket and&#13;
the private operator will agree on an accounting system generally accepted for&#13;
commercial enterprises and compatible with the information normally required by&#13;
the Municipality and the Ministry of Interior. The Sirket will request necessary&#13;
financial statements, including operational and financial indicators to evaluate&#13;
the performance of its operator. These indicators will be included in the lease&#13;
and management contracts. The Project will provide technical assistance to&#13;
establish the computerized accounting system and record keeping such as customer&#13;
billings, accounts receivable and payable, payroll, inventories and control of&#13;
budget execution. Accounts will be audited annually by independent accredited&#13;
auditors approved by the Bank. In addition, the Project will provide training&#13;
for the Sirket personnel to supplement on-the-job learning from the technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;

ANTALYA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment and Mitigation Plan&#13;
1.0   Introduction&#13;
1.1      The Water Supply and Sanitation Project has been classified as a&#13;
Category B project under the environmental guidelines of the World Bank&#13;
(operational Directive 4.01). This summarizes the environmental review,&#13;
undertaken by the Consultant and the PMU, of the environmental impacts of the&#13;
proposed project and provides recommendations for impact mitigation as required&#13;
in Annex C of the directive.&#13;
1.2      The project includes the following components:&#13;
Water&#13;
The rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply and distribution in&#13;
Antalya Metropolitan Municipality includes construction of wells, pumping&#13;
stations, reservoirs and laying of pipes. The system will be controlled by a&#13;
centralized telemetric monitoring and control system (SCADA) which will allow an&#13;
integrated, automatic management of the water storage and transmission networks.&#13;
Sewerage&#13;
The construction of a new sewerage network and a preliminary sewage&#13;
treatment plant, including a long sea outfall for the western part of the&#13;
Municipality.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
Provision of technical assistance for the implementation of the project and&#13;
institutional development.&#13;
2.0   Environmental Impacts&#13;
Water&#13;
Positive Impacts:&#13;
The impacts related to the upgrading of the water system which supplies&#13;
Greater Antalya are overwhelmingly positive. They include:&#13;
*     postponement of the need for developing costly new water resources;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
Annex 5.2&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
*     health and safety benefits associated with the provision of a secure supply&#13;
of clean water to the population;&#13;
*     savings in costs and manpower arising from the reduction of water-related&#13;
diseases;&#13;
*     extension of services to unserviced sections;&#13;
*     provision of water demand volumes through adequate pumping stations,&#13;
reservoirs and networks;&#13;
*     elimination of water service disruption caused by air-locked pipelines and&#13;
breaks; positive network pressure will be maintained at all times; and&#13;
*     provision of a telemonitoring system allowing the supply system to be run&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
Negative Impacts:&#13;
3     construction issues.  Many of the proposed activities will involve&#13;
short-term construction-related impacts;&#13;
-     increased water use.  Water consumption is expected to increase from 21.7&#13;
million m3 in 1993 to 32.1 million m3 in 2002, and water sold is expected&#13;
to increase from 18.2 million m3 in 1994 to 27.6 million m3 in 2002.  Water&#13;
connections will increase from 135,388 in 1994 to 220,000 in 2002, by which&#13;
time service coverage will reach 96 percent. Hydraulic sizing, air relief&#13;
valves and engineering concerns would be examined and acceptable solutions&#13;
incorporated into the engineering works related to the rehabilitation and&#13;
extension of the existing water system during design; and&#13;
*     increased wastewater.  The proposed sewage treatment plant will be designed&#13;
to handle the total flow of wastewater (see sewerage below).&#13;
Sewerace&#13;
Positive Impacts:&#13;
*     traditionally, because of the unusual characteristics of the underlying&#13;
karstic base-rock, effluent of septic tanks and cesspits from all&#13;
activities in the Metropolitan Area of Antalya infiltrates directly into&#13;
the underlying travertine formation through soaking pits (zerzemins)&#13;
connected to cracks or caverns in the rock. This situation is acute&#13;
because water supply is also provided from the same travertine. Already&#13;
some water sources have had to be abandoned and some others are now showing&#13;
traces of pollution. This problem will worsen quickly in the near future&#13;
due to the: (a) increase in population and (b) increase in tourism, and&#13;
commercial and industrial activities. Improvements in public health would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
Annex 5.2&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
certainly occur through reduction of potential drinking water contamination,&#13;
although lack of reliable epidemiological studies makes it difficult to quantify&#13;
this benefit;&#13;
*     Sewerage would be available for the first time in Antalya for about 400,000&#13;
households, or about 50 percent of the population. The network will be&#13;
built mostly in the western part of the city, where the water table is high&#13;
and construction of septic tanks is not feasible, and will extend to the&#13;
north to protect the main water supply sources; and&#13;
*     The construction of the sewage treatment plant will have a positive effect,&#13;
particularly on the development of the land in the western part of the&#13;
municipality which is mostly saturated due to the high water table.&#13;
Negative Impacts:&#13;
Impacts which arise from the construction of the sewerage and the sewage&#13;
treatment plant:&#13;
a     construction impacts are minimal, especially compared to the difficulties&#13;
of building septic tanks in high water table areas in the western part of&#13;
the municipality. Activities involve short-term construction-related&#13;
impacts; and&#13;
*     the western location for the proposed sewage treatment plant, already&#13;
incorporated in the Antalya urban development master plan several years&#13;
ago, is large enough to accommodate eventually a complete treatment plant&#13;
and is remote from residential areas to protect them against odors. The&#13;
land is unoccupied and in mixed agriculture and grazing use. Impacts&#13;
related to the construction and operation will be minimal as a consequence.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
Positive Impacts:&#13;
*     the technical assistance will strengthen efficiency, financial viability,&#13;
service quality, capacity to plan and implement investments, and&#13;
accountability to local consumers;&#13;
*     non-revenue water is expected to decrease from 46 percent in 1994 to 36&#13;
percent in 2002; and&#13;
*     through the leasing arrangement, the number of employees is expected to be&#13;
reduced significantly, from 3.5 employees/1000 connections to 1.8&#13;
employees/1OO connections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
Annex 5.2&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
Negative Impacts:&#13;
*     the technical assistance is costly and should be reduced to only essential&#13;
needs.&#13;
Mitigation Plan:&#13;
*     Engineering studies.  Environmental control measures will be reviewed by&#13;
the consultant and the Bank during the detailed design.&#13;
*     Construction Impacts.  The Consultant, in consultation with the PMU, will&#13;
develop a code of good practice for the civil works contractors and the&#13;
private operator which will be part of the tender documents.&#13;
3.0   Summary&#13;
A new institutional set-up will be put in place to manage the water&#13;
supply and sewerage. This project will have a positive net environmental impact.&#13;
However, a series of potentially negative impacts will be reviewed and a program&#13;
of mitigative measures will be established during the design for construction and&#13;
operation by the contractors and the private operator, respectively. Technical&#13;
assistance to the Sirket staff to improve capability to comprehend and mitigate&#13;
the impacts of the construction project will be provided by the project.&#13;

            Turkey - Antalya Water Supply and
            Sanitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Antalya Water
            Supply and Sanitation Project are to: a) meet at least cost
            the demand for water supply, sewerage and stormwater
            drainage; b) develop new institutional arrangements for
            management of municipal water supply, sewerage and
            stormwater drainage, and to introduce private sector
            participation in the operation of the services; c) implement
            appropriate cost recovery policies; d) postpone the need to
            develop costly new water resources by improving the
            efficiency of utilization of existing sources and of water
            usage by reducing the volume of non-revenue water which is
            presently too high; and e) improve and sustain environmental
            conditions and reduce health hazards that threaten the local
            population and the tourism industry. The project represents
            the first phase, to be implemented from 1995 throug 2002, of
            a program designed to continue to the year 2020. The project
            will: a) renovate, rehabilitate and extend the existing
            water supply network; b) provide a new sewerage network and
            a preliminary wastewater treatment plant on the western part
            of the municipality; c) improve operation of septic tanks in
            the eastern part of the city; d) upgrade the stormwater
            drainage system in flood areas and elaborate a comprehensive
            master plan; and e) provide technical assistance for project
            implementation and institutional development.
