including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;

2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;

additional financing.&#13;

Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right&#13;
to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be&#13;

4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange&#13;
