This paper shows that Japan was able to maintain relatively low levels of unemployment&#13;
even during periods of economic recession, due mainly to a combination of factors such&#13;
as its enduring cooperative relations between labor and industries, and strong legal&#13;
support of job security. It is often claimed that certain employment practices in Japan&#13;
constitute an indirect social policy that accomplishes welfare objectives that are more&#13;
often achieved through explicit public sector mechanisms in other countries. This paper&#13;
examines several Japanese employment practices with a view to understanding their&#13;
origins and evolution, the role of government policy in shaping them, and their&#13;
distinctiveness in comparison with other industrial countries. Attention is given to four&#13;
such practices: (a) flexible employment conditions; (b) lifetime employment; (c)&#13;
egalitarian in-house training; and (d) the use of female temporary workers.&#13;

This paper was prepared for a project on Social Development in East Asia. The project&#13;
was organized by the World Bank Institute under the auspices of the Program for the&#13;
Study of the Japanese Development Management Experience (The Brain Trust Program),&#13;
which is financed by the Policy and Human Resources Development Trust Fund&#13;
established at the World Bank by the Government of Japan (GOJ). We greatly appreciate&#13;
the generous support from GOJ.&#13;
&#13;
The principal objectives of this Program are to conduct studies on Japanese and East&#13;
Asian development management experience and to share the lessons of this experience&#13;
with developing and transition economies. The experiences of other countries are often&#13;
covered in order to ensure that these lessons are placed in the proper context. This&#13;
comparative method helps identify factors that influence the effectiveness of specific&#13;
institutional mechanisms, governance structures, and policy reforms in different contexts.&#13;
A related objective of the Program is to promote the exchange of ideas on development&#13;
among Japanese and non-Japanese scholars, technical experts and policy makers.&#13;
&#13;
The papers commissioned for this project cover a number of important issues related to&#13;
Japanese Social Policy. These issues include, among other, Japanese pension system,&#13;
public health insurance in Japan, evolution of social policy in Japan, role of families,&#13;
communities and government in improving socioeconomic performance, and Japanese&#13;
policies towards poverty &amp; public assistance. We hope that these papers will provide&#13;
important policy findings and lessons for policymakers in developing countries and other&#13;
development stakeholders.&#13;

Employment Practices as Social Policy&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
It is often claimed that certain employment practices in Japan constitute an indirect social policy that&#13;
accomplishes welfare objectives that are more often achieved through explicit public sector mechanisms in&#13;
other countries. This paper examines several Japanese employment practices with a view to understanding&#13;
their origins and evolution, the role of government policy in shaping them, and their distinctiveness in&#13;
comparison with other industrialized countries. Attention is focused on four such practices: (a) flexible&#13;
employment conditions; (b) lifetime employment; (c) egalitarian in-house training; and (d) the use of&#13;
female temporary workers.&#13;
     The social policy aspects of these practices can be assessed through their impact on such outcomes as&#13;
the incidence and duration of unemployment. For example, if flexible employment contracts allow a firm&#13;
to redeploy workers instead of laying them off, the incidence of unemployment should be lower, and so&#13;
should the costs of unemployment compensation to be borne by the public sector. The same outcome&#13;
occurs if lifetime employment practices are prevalent since such practices indicate a corporate&#13;
commitment to job security for employees. Egalitarian training opportunities ensure that the typical&#13;
worker will be redeployable across a broad range of the jobs available in the company and so should be&#13;
less vulnerable to retrenchment due to cyclical or structural changes in the economy. Finally, the use of&#13;
female temporary workers provides a way to buffer the core worker group of prime-age males from&#13;
cyclical shocks: When the economy booms, female temporary workers are taken on, and when the&#13;
economy contracts, they are the first to be laid off. If such temporary workers are not eligible for&#13;
unemployment compensation, the burden on the public sector is lower.&#13;
     Two caveats should be noted at this stage. First, the focus on social policy dimensions should not be&#13;
taken to mean that these are necessarily the most important aspects of employment practices in Japan.&#13;
Indeed, the evolution of such practices may have more to do with other considerations such as economic&#13;
growth, technological development, flexibility and competitiveness. Second, it is not being argued that it is&#13;
better to achieve welfare goals through employment practices than through direct public sector&#13;
expenditures. Indeed, there may be significant costs associated with such practices. However, these issues&#13;
are not dealt with in this paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Flexible Employment Conditions&#13;
&#13;
It is said that Japanese firms think highly of job security for their employees. For a decade and a half after&#13;
World War II, however, many firms (even large ones among them) routinely dismissed or laid off workers.&#13;
For example, in the depression year of 1949 when the government budget was sharply reduced, several well-&#13;
known firms resorted to massive dismissals one after another. These firms included: Daido Steel, Oki&#13;
Electric, NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Hodogaya Chemical, Mitsui Chemical, Sankyo Pharmacy, Nihon&#13;
Cement, Isuzu Motors, Nissan Motors, Toyota Motors, Nihon Mining, Dowa Mining, Showa Denko ,and&#13;
Nihon Victor. According to Ministry of Labor statistics at that time, there were 9,059 establishments that had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      1&#13;

&#13;
a personnel reduction and about 440,000 workers who were dismissed in 1949. The Survey on Labor&#13;
Mobility ("Rodo Ido Chosa") also recorded that about 21 percent of the separated workers in the depressed&#13;
year of 1954 had been dismissed by companies. The corresponding ratio since the period of high economic&#13;
growth until recent times has been at most 10 percent (in 1975 and 1998).&#13;
    Massive dismissals also occurred after the First Oil Crisis (1973­74). A temporary survey to gauge the&#13;
severity of personnel adjustments after the crisis-- "Total Survey on Employment Change" (Ministry of&#13;
Labor 1979)--found that 1,600,000 workers were discharged between 1975 and 1978 in the&#13;
manufacturing sector.&#13;
    The extent of retrenchment during severe recessions provoked demands for greater job security. Such&#13;
a desire was comprehensively substantiated by the legislature after the First Oil Crisis. It is not that well&#13;
known, but the civil code of Japan stipulates that employers can freely break with their employees and&#13;
vice versa. The Labor Standard Law also permits employers to discharge their employees at a month's&#13;
notice or compensation. Actual massive dismissal owing to financial difficulties, however, is strongly&#13;
limited by Supreme Court precedents; currently known as the "Legal Principle for Abuse of Employer's&#13;
Right of Dismissal (`Kaiko-Ken Ranyo Hori' in Japanese)."&#13;
    This principle requires of employers four prerequisites for dismissal: (a) managerial necessity to&#13;
reduce the work force (for example, operating at a loss); (b) fulfillment of employer's obligation to avoid&#13;
dismissal (for example, job rotation or lending out of employees, layoff, recruitment of voluntary retirees);&#13;
(c) rationality of selection rules for dismissal (for example, selecting employees only by their performance&#13;
assessment is not normally permitted); and (d) validity of dismissal procedures (for example, the rules&#13;
mandate a prior labor-management consultation with respect to necessity, time schedule, scale, method,&#13;
and so on.) Moreover, once the dismissal is judged to be illegal, the corresponding firm must recover and&#13;
maintain the position of employees in question and fully compensate them for the forfeited wage during&#13;
the legal dispute. We note here that discharging employees by paying an attractive severance pay is not&#13;
legally permitted as a method of resolution.1 Of course, based on the labor-management agreement,&#13;
companies are allowed to accept voluntary retirement.&#13;
    Finally, around the same time, the Supreme Court also established the "Legal Principle for&#13;
Disadvantageous Modification of Employment Conditions" ("Rodo Jyoken no Furieki Henko Hori" in&#13;
Japanese) that permits employers to unilaterally modify employment conditions in a disadvantageous&#13;
manner for employees within the "rational range." In other words, the Court puts a first priority on job&#13;
security and tries to maintain work force flexibility by leaving the other employment conditions to&#13;
employers' discretion.&#13;
    Among the employment conditions that firms often choose to adjust is the job assignment of&#13;
employees. In Japan, employers are able to re-assign employees to different jobs at subsidiaries or related&#13;
(and sometimes unrelated) firms, a practice known as "Syukko" or "Tenseki." Such reshuffling allows&#13;
firms to redeploy employees instead of having to retrench them, thereby avoiding increases in public&#13;
social expenditure on unemployment compensation. Figure 1 shows the ratio of reshuffled employees to&#13;
total separated employees during 1970­95. It is clear that reshuffling has been a popular practice among&#13;
Japanese firms for most of this period, averaging about 62 percent of separations. Only in the recent past&#13;
(1995­95) does the ratio appear to have declined below the historical average.&#13;
    The legal ability to redeploy employees within a corporation has also imparted flexibility to the&#13;
Japanese system. For example, Japan was able to shift workers quite rapidly into the high-technology&#13;
segment of the manufacturing sector during 1970­91. As table 1 shows, Japan fared better in this regard&#13;
when compared to several other OECD countries in which high-technology manufacturing is prominent.&#13;

Lifetime Employment&#13;
&#13;
The idea of "lifetime employment" is commonly associated with Japanese employment practices. Table 2,&#13;
based on Chuma (1998a), shows the percentage of lifetime employees to the total number of employees by&#13;
selected firm and employee characteristics. It is clear that the likelihood of lifetime employment is higher&#13;
for male employees compared to females, university graduates compared to high school graduates, and&#13;
employees in very large firms (more than 5,000 employees) compared to very small firms (fewer than 10&#13;
employees). While the data shown in table 2 pertain only to the cohort of employees who in 1990 were&#13;
aged between 50 and 54 years and had more than 27 years of tenure, the pattern is similar for other cohorts&#13;
and for other points in time. The relationship with firm size is strongly consistent: The larger the firm, the&#13;
greater the proportion of lifetime employees to total employees. In terms of evolution over time, lifetime&#13;
employment has become more prevalent since 1980 across most firm sizes and employee age and tenure&#13;
cohorts (see Chuma, 1998a).&#13;

&#13;
PUBLIC POLICY TO SECURE LONG-TERM EMPLOYMENT. In Japan, the government has been using the term&#13;
"Employment Insurance System" (EIS) instead of the conventional "Unemployment Insurance System."&#13;
Actually, the EIS consists of two different types of systems: (a) one for the provision of relief to the&#13;
unemployed, and (b) one for the prevention of unemployment or the protection of current job security. As&#13;
expected, the latter system plays a supplemental role in securing long-term employment practices.&#13;
     The main objective of the original system was to relieve the unemployed, which had been a well-&#13;
implemented practice during the decade and a half following World War II. For example, the public&#13;
relief work for the unemployed absorbed, on a daily average within a year, 250,000 of the 820,000&#13;
unemployed in 1957. We should note here, however, that, even in that year, about 70 percent of the&#13;
workers absorbed by the program were more than 40 years old, and 82 percent had been out of work&#13;
for more than one year. Such aging and relief-prolongation tendencies accelerated every year and the&#13;
corresponding ratios became, respectively, 95 percent and 100 percent in 1969. In other words, the&#13;
originally successful public relief work eventually created a serious moral hazard problem on the&#13;
workers' side. This is one of reasons why the current EIS was introduced. It is also surprising that the&#13;
special law enacted just after World War II for relief work was finally abolished in 1995.&#13;
     The latter systemis called "Measures for Employment Stability." These measures consist of various&#13;
types of subsidies to prevent unemployment, maintain current jobs, or promote new employment. Among&#13;
them, the most popular and critical one is the "Employment Adjustment Subsidy" (EAS). The program&#13;
was introduced in 1975 to cope with employment instability caused by the First Oil Crisis. The subsidized&#13;
establishments are the ones facing financial difficulties owing to recessions, changes in industry structure,&#13;
and so on. The subsidies can be used to guarantee wages for laid-off workers (one-half of normal wages&#13;
for large firms and two-thirds for medium-scale or small firms), to conduct vocational training (one-half of&#13;
normal wages paid during training days for large firms and two-thirds for medium-scale or small firms), or&#13;
to conduct "Syukko" (half of the wage to be covered by parent companies for large firms and two-thirds&#13;
for medium-scale or small firms). For example, during 1991­95, 173.9 billion yen was spent for the EAS,&#13;
out of which 124.6 billion yen (for a total of 17,630,000 work days) was for guaranteeing wages for the&#13;
laid-off, 29.7 billion yen (for 2,880,000 work days) for vocational training, and 19.6 billion yen (for&#13;
30,000) for "Syukko."&#13;
     Generally speaking, it is very difficult for private firms to guarantee long-term job security. Entrusting&#13;
this to the government, however, is likely to induce moral hazard problems that increase social costs all the&#13;
more. Thus, to restrain excessive retrenchment, a program must be carefully designed so that it does not&#13;
induce moral hazard. In this respect, EAS introduces many stringent constraints: Most of the candidates&#13;
must belong to the industries that the Minister of Labor approves. They also must sign special agreements&#13;
with labor unions or representatives of employees stipulating lay-off periods, contents of vocational&#13;
training, "Syukko" plans, range of employees, amount of compensation, and so on. Moreover, quite a few&#13;
documents must be submitted even after getting the official permission.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                Employment Practices as Social Policy      5&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
LENGTH OF TENURE: AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON. According to the recent Employment Outlook&#13;
1997 published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 1997), the&#13;
ratio of employees whose tenure is 20 years or more (in 1995) is 21.4 percent in Japan, 17 percent in&#13;
Germany, 18.7 percent in France, 16.5 percent in Spain, 6.8 percent in Australia, 9.4 percent in the&#13;
United Kingdom, and 9.0 percent in the United States. Hence, the number in Japan is the highest but&#13;
not excessive compared to those in European countries. Compared with these countries, the ones in&#13;
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States are extremely low. This, however, does not&#13;
always mean that in every age group, workers in Australia, the United Kingdom, or the United States&#13;
are quite mobile. On the contrary, the low ratios in these countries might come mainly from the&#13;
considerably high mobility among young workers. This point is partly confirmed in table 3 (based on&#13;
the OECD report above):&#13;

    This table indicates that the mobility of both young and old workers is relatively low in Japan and&#13;
Germany. In the United States, however, despite the low rate for young workers, the one for old workers is&#13;
comparable to the rate in Japan or Germany. Moreover, as workers' tenure gets longer, retention rates&#13;
increase drastically in every country.&#13;

Egalitarian In-House Training Practices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The typical production system in Japan is characterized by the following four factors:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (a) In training blue-collar workers on the job, a special training system is introduced so that they can&#13;
         learn the production process as a whole as well as the job stages at specific phases. As a result,&#13;
         most workers are trained to be self-reliant problem-solvers who are cognizant of the task from&#13;
         start to finish;&#13;
    (b) Engineers at the production-technology, design, or Research and Development (R&amp;D) sections&#13;
         have experience gained through working in various jobs in the manufacturing processes along&#13;
         with blue-collar workers;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6        Hiroyuki Chuma&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     (c) Management attaches a great deal of importance to site-specific or relation-specific information&#13;
         that needs to be discovered while actively at work--such as ways of improving production&#13;
         processes, maintenance methods, or defects in quality or blueprints; and&#13;
     (d) There is a prompt feedback system (the "concurrent engineering" system) that makes the best use&#13;
         of the above-mentioned site- or relation-specific information by sharing it among such different&#13;
         sections as engineering, R&amp;D, production, sales, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Additionally, in the special training system, various incentive systems are installed (such as "skill&#13;
maps" or "skill evaluation systems"), which become a driving force to enhance workers' desire for&#13;
personal improvement. Furthermore, merit-rating systems that are dependent on several superiors to&#13;
maintain objectivity as much as possible have been introduced. Such rating results are used to determine a&#13;
worker's salary class, level of bonus, and career patterns in the long as well as the short run. The salary&#13;
class, however, is not attached to a specific job but instead depends on a worker's potential to perform&#13;
various jobs as well as his or her actual performance. Moreover, final decision-making authority to&#13;
evaluate and promote workers belongs to the personnel department, which keeps all worker records at the&#13;
head office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THE HISTORICAL ORIGIN OF JAPAN'S PRODUCTION PROCESSES. It is interesting to delve into a time when&#13;
quite a few Japanese firms started introducing the above-mentioned production processes. On this, to my&#13;
knowledge, there is no definite evidence. To be sure, as is shown in Udagawa and others (1995), such big&#13;
firms as Toyota, Nissan, and Matsushita Electric (better known as Panasonic) have introduced similar&#13;
production systems in the 1960s. However, this does not mean that most of the other large Japanese firms&#13;
have followed the same course of action. For example, a recent survey conducted by this author&#13;
establishes the following facts: About 63 percent of sampled machine-tool makers have established the&#13;
above-mentioned close information-sharing system between the mechanical design and production&#13;
departments. Among these, 62 percent report that their system was established after 1980. This figure goes&#13;
up to 74 percent if the cutoff year is 1970.&#13;
     How is it, then, that the current egalitarian information-sharing system appears to have been&#13;
introduced fairly recently? To answer this question, we may turn to the study's comprehensive&#13;
findings, but the following comments from the mechanical designers who used to take part in&#13;
manufacturing various leading products for one of the country's largest machine-tool makers should&#13;
suffice: "During the time when traditional non-numerical-control (non-NC) lathes or milling&#13;
machines were produced, mechanical designers were very much overconfident regarding the current&#13;
standard. This must have been mainly because these non-NC machines could be theorized to a&#13;
considerable extent by mechanical designers themselves. However, as the machines became equipped&#13;
with computer numerical control (CNC) and multifunctional as shown in machining centers or&#13;
complex lathes, the power of such theorizing gradually weakened. The trend gained more momentum&#13;
by the advent of high-speed and high-precision machines equipped with Auto Tool Changers (ATC)&#13;
or Auto Pallet Changers (APC). When machines become that complex, designers have to take into&#13;
account various factors to be able to design good machines beforehand. But, except in extremely rare&#13;
cases, it must be almost impossible to do that. It is at this point that the present concurrent and&#13;
egalitarian information-sharing system among various departments and divisions starts playing an&#13;
important role. In particular, compared with machinists' skills derived from first-hand experience,&#13;
first-rate assembly workers are likely to depend more on a large number of "rules of thumb." These&#13;
rule-of-thumb-based skills are also quite durable (in terms of resisting obsolescence) even in the face&#13;
of rapid technological development. As a result, relative to machining shops, assembling shops have&#13;
become more powerful than before.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                  Employment Practices as Social Policy    7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Certainly we can find several prewar documents on advanced companies that exemplify the&#13;
importance of the interplay between skilled workers and engineers. However, it is doubtful that this close&#13;
relationship also had an egalitarian nature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
QUALITY CONTROL ACTIVITIES AS ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. The essence of the Japanese-style&#13;
production system discussed above is well substantiated in such small-group activities as Japanese-&#13;
style Quality Control (QC). Many people erroneously think that quality problems show up mainly&#13;
when workers on the job do not follow the correct standard determined by production management.&#13;
Quality Control or Total Quality Control (TQC) activities in Japan, however, are based on a very&#13;
different idea--specifically, on the egalitarian notion that "nobody can make sure (at the beginning)&#13;
why quality problems in question ... appear. To clarify the causes and effects, it is desirable to let&#13;
concerned people know how to find out causes and strive for detecting and removing them"&#13;
(Nakamura 1996). In this sense, the QC or TQC movement is one of the voluntary methods for&#13;
production workers to participate in management. Nitta (1988) identifies the four main roles of QC&#13;
Circle activities in Japan: (a) mutual understanding within each group, (b) enlarging and enriching the&#13;
tasks that each worker completes, (c) promoting better understanding of jobs and production&#13;
processes via on-the-job training (OJT), and (d) making tasks tractable through improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THE ACTUAL EXTENT OF OJT PRACTICE. Referring to field research on OJT is probably the quickest way&#13;
of finding out how (well-systematized) OJT is done in typical Japanese companies. For example, Koike&#13;
(1988, 1990), Ishida and others (1997), and Chuma (1998b) make clear that extensive training on the job&#13;
enables Japanese (regular) workers to be quite flexible when facing changes in the economic environment.&#13;
Below are selected results of studies I recently completed on medium-size machine-tool makers producing&#13;
small NC lathes.&#13;
     Company profile: This medium-size machine-tool maker mainly produces small turret lathes; it is&#13;
well known for its use of advanced technology to promptly produce highly efficient and cheap machines&#13;
for job-shops making auto parts. It has 280 ordinary employees, of which about 90 are production workers.&#13;
In 1996, on average, 100 lathes were produced monthly, 60 of those belonged to the company's "key&#13;
product" category.&#13;
     Investigation of the workplace: The main factory has six sections: a metal-processing section, four&#13;
assembling sections, and a production-technology section. Below we introduce the OJT system in the third&#13;
assembling section; the system is responsible for assembling the main body of NC lathes from scratch,&#13;
installing various ready-made units, and handscraping. The section also manages this stage's quality&#13;
control, delivery, and safety; plans training; and deals with users' claims.&#13;
     Necessary skills and the corresponding process formation: All of the newly hired who are assigned&#13;
to the third assembling section must get involved in assembling the standardized main body of lathes.&#13;
Specifically, this task is separated into five processes:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     (1) Assembling the slide of the X-axis (corresponding to lathe's table) and the Z-axis (corresponding&#13;
         to lathe's spindle);&#13;
     (2) Installing and wiring electricity boxes, including those of NC units;&#13;
     (3) Installing turret units and the oil supply and drainage system for cutting and lubrication;&#13;
     (4) Testing the precision of standardized main bodies of the lathes; and&#13;
     (5) Installing the cover for the standardized lathes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Of these, the most difficult is the fourth process; normally workers with three to four years of&#13;
experience are in charge at this point. This process includes several instances of troubleshooting. Of&#13;
course, even the first process needs the requisite skills in installing ball screws and in finding out each&#13;
axis' center--crucial tasks with a great deal of impact on the precision of lathes.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8        Hiroyuki Chuma&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     One of the main reasons why the newly hired are in charge of assembling the standardized lathe&#13;
bodies is that they gain repeat experience. After the NC lathe bodies are successfully assembled in this&#13;
process, other skilled workers start assembling user-specific option units. At this stage, the principle of&#13;
"one skilled assembling worker for one machine" is applied. Of course, there are many tasks involved with&#13;
this stage as well, requiring skills ranging from rudimentary (for example, installing covers) to highly&#13;
developed (for example, installing the auto-work-loader, auto-palette-changer (APC), or auto-tool-changer&#13;
(ATC). Thus, even in installing user-specific options one can diversify work assignments, having the less-&#13;
skilled workers start with relatively easy tasks at the beginning and gradually moving them to more&#13;
difficult ones.&#13;
     The number of machines produced by the newly hired is not counted as part of the monthly planned&#13;
amount. What is emphasized at this stage is that each worker needs to learn how to properly assemble&#13;
machines by following the precision standards stipulated by the blueprint. If a certain individual is unable&#13;
to complete a task as specified, one-to-one instruction is given by skilled workers (normally the&#13;
corresponding section chief) until the task is successfully completed by the individual worker in question.&#13;
On average, this instruction period continues for 6 to 12 months. Senior workers (with a year of&#13;
experience) also teach the newly hired what they have learned in the previous year. These workers can&#13;
usually make their skills more reliable when they become instructors.&#13;
     The main task force that shoulders the responsibility in the third assembling section consists of&#13;
workers with about four years of experience. Of course, since manual dexterity depends greatly on each&#13;
person's potential, whether or not one can master necessary skills depends on each individual. Thus,&#13;
irrespective of tenure or age, only workers who are judged by the section chief to be sufficiently skillful&#13;
are put in charge of the corresponding tasks.&#13;
     Typical production workers are able to learn, through experience, the necessary basic skills for&#13;
assembling or metal processing. Afterward, in the work environment where handling machines, bites,&#13;
parts, or measuring devices have been rapidly changing owing to technological innovation, each skilled&#13;
worker tries to accumulate the appropriate skills by trial and error. Of course, said technological&#13;
innovation surely renders the elderly workers' existing skills somewhat obsolete, but these workers train&#13;
the newly hired who then start accumulating new skills by treating what they learn as a starting point&#13;
rather than a set of rules set in stone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EGALITARIAN IN-HOUSE TRAINING: AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON. Owing to limited data availability,&#13;
it is very difficult to make an international comparison of levels of in-house training. The recent "Jobs&#13;
Study" (OECD 1994), however, provides us with some basis for comparison by reporting on levels of&#13;
enterprise-based off-the-job training (Off-JT) in Australia, Germany, Japan, Sweden, and the United&#13;
States. It mentions that:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     (a) The probability of receiving Off-JT in Japan is more evenly distributed than in other&#13;
         countries;&#13;
     (b) By contrast, in the United States those with college-level qualifications are roughly five times&#13;
         as likely to receive further training compared with workers with no formal qualifications,&#13;
         while in Germany they are about four times as likely. (Note: the corresponding number in&#13;
         Japan is 1.25);&#13;
     (c) In the United States, the above-mentioned relative difference has increased over time;&#13;
         college-educated workers entering the labor market in 1983 were just over three times as&#13;
         likely to have gone through a formal company training program, but just over four times as&#13;
         likely in 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     From these results, we can observe the seemingly egalitarian nature in the Japanese in-house training&#13;
system.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                              Employment Practices as Social Policy    9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEAK ROLE PLAYED BY PUBLIC VOCATIONAL POLICY. Some readers may think that, as is the case&#13;
with Germany's dual system,2 the typical in-house training conducted in Japanese firms is heavily&#13;
subsidized. This is not true. On the contrary, the government has an extremely minor role in&#13;
vocational training.&#13;
    The postwar public vocational training system originated from the enforcement of the Public&#13;
Vocational Training Law in 1958. The law was revised in 1969 as the New Public Vocational Training&#13;
Law and in 1985 as the Promotion Law for Vocational Ability Development (PLVAD). At the&#13;
beginning, the system had a strong relief-work aspect in serving the unemployed; it then changed to&#13;
emphasize its role as the supply center for skilled workers. It is now starting to extend its range to&#13;
reeducation and training for general workers (including white-collar employees). Such an extension,&#13;
however, is not sufficiently justifiable because the benefit provided by this kind of public service is&#13;
estimated to be much smaller than the one derived from public school education. As a matter of fact, the&#13;
recent government-restructuring plan proposes to abolish one of the driving forces of the PLVAD: the&#13;
(Public) Institute for Employment Promotion. In 1994, the total budget, covered by the central&#13;
government, for public vocational education and training facilities, was 125.9 billion yen (Ministry of&#13;
Labor 1970).&#13;
    In the current public vocational training system, the most popular program is the Trade Skill&#13;
Licensing Course, which offers National Trade Skill Licensing (NTSL). In 1994 106,000 workers were&#13;
successful candidates of first- or second-class NTSL. From 1959 to 1994 a total of 2 million workers&#13;
completed the course (Ministry of Labor 1996). Publicly offered types of NTSL (currently more than&#13;
130 variants) have been steadily increasing, reflecting the rapid advance of technology. How such&#13;
publicly guaranteed skills are used within each business is vividly illustrated with real-life examples in&#13;
Koike (1981). In my investigative experience, these skill certifications are not directly useful for current&#13;
jobs but are utilized in each firm as a kind of driver's license that showcases the licensees' potential&#13;
abilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Use of Temporary Female Workers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As is shown in figure 2, as far as male workers are concerned, the share of regular workers in the total&#13;
workforce has been virtually constant for these 20­30 years, while the corresponding ratio for females&#13;
drastically decreased after the First Oil Crisis. The last result is confirmed by the fact that the number&#13;
of part-timers doubled during this period and most of them were women. Actually, according to the&#13;
Basic Survey on the Employment Structure (published every year by the Statistics Bureau), about 11&#13;
percent of the total (which amounts to 52 million employees) is made up of part-timers and about 94&#13;
percent of those are female workers. In other words, in the last two decades, many Japanese firms&#13;
have been trying to maintain the flexibility of their work force by employing a large number of&#13;
female temporary workers. As is also shown in figure 5, the ratio of regular workers continued to&#13;
increase during the high economic growth period of the 1960s for both male and female workers.&#13;

&#13;
    As is the case in Japan, in many other countries female workers are more likely to be employed as&#13;
part-timers than males. For example, in table 4 the OECD Employment Outlook (1997) gives the&#13;
following composition of part-time work in 1995 (the part-timer is defined as a worker who is employed&#13;
for fewer than 35 hours per week).&#13;
    According to this table, the composition of female part-time workers in Japan is not that high and&#13;
women's share in part-time employment is the second-lowest. Rather prominent is that the composition of&#13;
males is the third-highest among these countries.&#13;

LIMITED LIFETIME EMPLOYMENT FOR FEMALES. Table 2 shows that, compared to males, females are&#13;
much less likely to be in "lifetime employment" status. This is so regardless of firm size and employee&#13;
characteristics such as educational attainment. This difference with male employees is another aspect of&#13;
the greater degree of "temporariness" in female employment in Japan. Indeed, there is virtually no&#13;
lifetime employment among female high school graduates working in small firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A FLEXIBLE FEMALE WORK FORCE. Based on the macroeconomic data during 1960­1991, the OECD&#13;
Employment Outlook (1993) estimates the following equation:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     (The range of departure from the trend value in the labor force)&#13;
      = Constant + ÿ (the departure from the trend value in actual employment)&#13;
&#13;
     where, by definition, the high ÿ actually means that the labor force expands and contracts flexibly,&#13;
depending on labor market conditions. The results indicate that the correlation coefficient (ÿ) is quite&#13;
high for Japan (0.89) and Italy (0.68); moderate for (previously Federal Republic of) Germany (0.49)&#13;
and Canada (0.41); and quite low for the United States (0.31), the United Kingdom (0.29), and France&#13;
(0.28).&#13;
     In Japan, the female labor force is well known for such flexibility. This is partly confirmed by figure&#13;
3, which shows that as women are apt to be discouraged workers, the total number of the female&#13;
unemployed exhibits less drastic shifts than that of the male unemployed. We should note, however, that&#13;
reflecting the change in their lifestyle, women have recently tended to stay within the labor force even&#13;
during times of recession. This is one of the reasons why unemployment rates in Japan show an upward&#13;
trend.&#13;

Summary&#13;
&#13;
The results in this paper can be summarized as follows:&#13;
    The courts have assigned top priority to job security by imposing strict discharge rules (namely, the&#13;
"Legal Principle of Abuse of Employer's Right of Dismissal") on firms. However, most of these rules&#13;
have been established based on precedents (or case laws). In other words, the courts have prudently&#13;
reconfirmed the reality established during the transformation process from hostile to cooperative industrial&#13;
relations. In particular, the current legal rule was finally institutionalized after the First Oil Crisis.&#13;
    During this crisis, to mitigate the inflexibility imposed by the above-mentioned rule, courts of various&#13;
levels (including the Supreme Court) admitted severely depressed firms to unilaterally change working&#13;
conditions (embodied in the "Legal Principle for Disadvantageous Modification of Employment&#13;
Conditions"). Some employees are adversely affected by this ruling, at least for the moment.&#13;
    Guaranteed by this second legal doctrine, even after adjusting working hours and discharging&#13;
temporary workers, most firms still have a tendency to reshuffle (or loan out) their work force within the&#13;
firm or a group of firms before resorting to layoffs. This partly reflects the fact that Japanese firms provide&#13;
their (regular) employees with training opportunities more frequently than European or American firms. In&#13;
exchange for job security, workers have been voluntarily accepting such reshuffling.&#13;
    Compared with other countries, the sectoral shift within or among industries has been also promptly&#13;
done as well. The movement of workers from the large to medium-size or small firms also occurs on a&#13;
large scale, especially during economically depressed periods. The courts have also supported such a&#13;
movement.&#13;
    The guaranteed employment security discussed above enables many Japanese firms to undertake&#13;
broad, frequent, and egalitarian skill formation efforts based on mutual consent. Consequently, firms are&#13;
able to acquire flexible overhead employment to cope with rapid technological development and the&#13;
changing economic environment. Moreover, the inflexibility of the entire work force that is attributable to&#13;
the "Legal Principle of Abuse of Employer's Right of Dismissal" is partly alleviated by the existence of&#13;
flexible female nonregular workers.&#13;
    In addition to the usual unemployment insurance, a public employment policy called the&#13;
"Employment Adjustment Subsidy" (EAS) was introduced, just after the First Oil Crisis, to give firms&#13;
incentives to maintain job security for their work force.&#13;
    Mainly through the Spring Labor Offensive, wage rates have been determined flexibly enough to&#13;
reflect the supply-and-demand nature of labor markets.&#13;
    The female labor force has been quite pro-cyclical; it exits labor markets on a massive scale during&#13;
recessions and returns during periods of economic boom.&#13;

            Employment practices as social policy
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper shows that Japan was able to
            maintain relatively low levels of unemployment, even during
            periods of economic recession, due mainly to a combination
            of factors, such as its enduring cooperative relations
            between labor and industries, and strong legal support of
            job security. It is often claimed that certain employment
            practices in Japan constitute an indirect social policy that
            accomplishes welfare objectives that are more often achieved
            through explicit public sector mechanisms in other
            countries. This paper examines several Japanese employment
            practices with a view to understanding their origins and
            evolution, the role of government policy in shaping them,
            and their distinctiveness in comparison with other
            industrial countries. Attention is given to four such
            practices: (a) flexible employment conditions; (b) lifetime
            employment; (c) egalitarian in-house training; and (d) the
            use of female temporary workers.
