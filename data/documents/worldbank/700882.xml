ABSTRACT&#13;
This report is part of an inquiry undertaken by the World Bank&#13;
in conjunction with scholars from 12 industrial countries into the&#13;
penetration  of  the  markets  of  industrial  countries  by  exports  of&#13;
manufactures from developing countries. The project sought to establish&#13;
the shares of industrial country markets held by the developing&#13;
countries, changes in such shares in the 1970s, and why they vary among&#13;
industry groups and countries.   The aim is to assist developing and&#13;
industrial countries to improve their policies through a better&#13;
understanding of trade patterns and protectionist measures.&#13;
An often overlooked but very important element in the political&#13;
economy of protection has been "the bureaus" (bureaucrats).  This paper&#13;
looks at the role of the bureaus in the supply of protection in&#13;
France.  The tendency has been for the bureaus to advocate protection,&#13;
even  beyond  that  advocated  by  politicians.    This  tendency  seems&#13;
contradictory to the presumed public interest goals of bureaus, which&#13;
would be to favor free trade. Moreover, the bureaus have often resorted&#13;
to complex subsidy programs or hidden non-tariff barriers that are hard&#13;
to measure, rather than to transparent protection measures.&#13;
Three factors that relate in large part to the bureaus' roles&#13;
and   relationships   appear   to   influence   their   tendency   toward&#13;
protection.   One is a bureau's position as a "partial dictator" with&#13;
respect to the industry it supervises.   A second is the inability of a&#13;
bureau to capture the profits that result from protection. A third is&#13;
the costs to a bureau of information about the impact of protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The  study  suggests  several  approaches  to  negating  the&#13;
protectionist tendency of bureaus.  The larger a bureau's mandate, the&#13;
more likely it is to favor free trade. More accurate information about&#13;
the impact of protection on the consumer will lead to more emphasis on&#13;
free trade; that information is best obtained by institutions that can&#13;
examine the full range of final goods.  Finally, more attention to and&#13;
study of the relations between trade policy and administrative structure&#13;
are necessary.&#13;

Chapter I&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
To date, the human factors considered in the literature on the&#13;
political economy of protection have been almost exclusively politicians&#13;
and voters, while the role played by bureaucrats has been largely&#13;
ignored.   A well-known exception is Breton,l-  whose approach, however,&#13;
is rather different from that contained in this paper.  While Breton's&#13;
approach may be adequate for the U.S. case, it does not seem to fit the&#13;
European situation well because of constitutional and institutional&#13;
rules at both the national and EC levels.  It is not excessive to argue&#13;
that, in many respects, top-level bureaucrats have been responsible for&#13;
determining the level of protection at least as much as politicians&#13;
have, although obviously there are substantial differences among the&#13;
European states.&#13;
This paper analyzes the role of the bureaucracy on the supply&#13;
side of the market for protection 21 If the bureaus had been pursuing&#13;
public interest goals, they should have exhibited behavior that favored&#13;
free trade.  However, this does not appear to have been the case.  On&#13;
1/ A. Breton, The Economic Theory of Representative Government,&#13;
Chicago: Aldine Publishing Co., 1974.&#13;
2/ For the sake of simplicity, "bureau and bureaucrats" will be used&#13;
here  interchangeably.      "Bureaus"  are  broadly  defined  as  any&#13;
institution in which civil servants are a non-negligible proportion&#13;
of  the personnel.   No  clearcut  distinction  is made between an&#13;
individual bureaucrat and a bureau. (A more sophisticated approach&#13;
would be to recognize  the differences in the objectives of the&#13;
members of a bureau, along the lines of the theory of teams a la&#13;
Marschak-Radner.)    Finally,  it is assumed  that bureaus are not&#13;
corrupted by the industries they supervise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
the contrary, the evidence is that the bureaus have tended to advocate&#13;
protection. Although some bureaus have been more concerned with helping&#13;
export- than import-competing firms, they have not necessarily been free&#13;
trade-oriented.  Friendliness toward exporters is not usually perceived&#13;
of as being inconsistent with a quite protectionist attitude toward&#13;
other sectors.   Moreover, where an industry was hurt by a new foreign&#13;
competitor,   the  bureaus  rarely  advocated  transparent   protective&#13;
measures, but, rather, supported complex subsidy policies (which are&#13;
hard to measure fully) or hidden non-tariff barriers (NTBs). Within the&#13;
bureaucratic framework, the implementation of measures appears to have&#13;
been the result of a quite decentralized institutional framework,&#13;
involving more than just politicians.&#13;
Three arguments will be presented to explain the protectionist&#13;
behavior of the bureaus.   Following Chapter II, which provides some&#13;
background to bureaucratic policy-making, Chapter III presents the&#13;
argument that a bureau in charge of trade policy may be considered as a&#13;
'partial dictator" which will define the "rights to be protected from&#13;
foreign  competition"  in  favor  of  the  factors  of  production  it&#13;
supervises. Further, a bureau tends to think of protective measures as&#13;
"goods" and to overproduce them relative to the optimum level.   In&#13;
Chapter  IV,  politicians  and  bureaus  are  compared  as  producers  of&#13;
protection. The main conclusion is that bureaus are likely to produce&#13;
more protection than politicians are.  In Chapter V, it is argued that&#13;
information costs will increase the bias of bureaus toward protection.&#13;
All three arguments provide strong support for the idea that&#13;
bureaucrats favor relatively greater protection than do politicians. At&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
first glance, this conclusion seems paradoxical, since it is often&#13;
believed that bureaucrats will be more "neutral" than politicians in&#13;
determining trade policies because they cannot derive any political&#13;
profit from such policies.  However, it will be shown that bureaucrats&#13;
do not get such political profits.&#13;
The fact that bureaucrats tend to be more protectionist than&#13;
politicians raises some doubts about the validity of the theoretical&#13;
arguments that suggest that subsidies are superior to tariffs as&#13;
instruments of commercial policy.  It will be argued, to the contrary,&#13;
that these theories are misleading because they do not fully take into&#13;
account that these policy instruments are typically administered by&#13;
public bodies which are protection-prone.&#13;
Finally, some ways of limiting the protectionist bias of&#13;
bureaus are discussed in Chapter VI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Chapter II&#13;
ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISMS&#13;
As stated above, there are differences among the European&#13;
states in the role of the bureaucracy in carrying out commercial&#13;
policy. Some countries such as Denmark, and perhaps the United Kingdom,&#13;
are still somewhat similar to the United States, in that it is&#13;
appropriate to consider only the role of politicians.   In others, such&#13;
as the Federal Republic of Germany and above all France, there is strong&#13;
evidence that bureaus make decisive choices in the field of commercial&#13;
policy.  Finally, there is the EC Commission, a bureaucratic body that&#13;
plays an essential role in controlling commercial policy in its member&#13;
states.-&#13;
Bureaus and Trade Policy in France&#13;
It is interesting to look at some historical examples of how&#13;
bureaus have functioned as decision-makers in the field of commercial&#13;
policy in France.   French commercial policy during the 1920s and the&#13;
1930s, which was imitated at the time by several European countries and&#13;
was maintained more or less through the '50s, is one of the best&#13;
illustrations of the dominant role of the bureaus.   In the thoroughly&#13;
mystifying French Tariff Law of 1920, Parliament voted to re-establish&#13;
the specific duties existing in 1913. The governmental bureaus were to&#13;
I/  J.  Waelbroeck  and  E.  Verreydt,  "European  Community  Protection&#13;
Against Manufactured  Imports from Developing  Countries:   A Case&#13;
Study in the Political Economy of Protection," in J. Bhagwati, ed.,&#13;
Adjustment and Protection, Chicago:   University of Chicago Press,&#13;
1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
compute (and enforce by decrees) the "coefficients" to be applied to&#13;
those duties, taking into account the wartime and postwar inflation and&#13;
economic changes.   The coefficients in fact were set at a level that&#13;
provided real protection three and four (and sometimes seven or eight)&#13;
times the old duty rates.&#13;
The predominant role of the bureaucracy was also clearly&#13;
evident under the Tariff Laws of 1926-1927, through which the Parliament&#13;
gave the government the power to establish a new schedule of tariff&#13;
rates (called a "consolidation").  It reached its peak after 1931, with&#13;
an incredibly detailed system of quotas.&#13;
An interesting feature of the system, one that is frequently&#13;
observed in bureaucratic systems of protection, is that the bureaus&#13;
tried to push discrimination between countries as far as possible. For&#13;
example, they attempted to conclude bilateral trade agreements and to&#13;
promote the "conditional" version of the Most Favored Nation clause.&#13;
Indeed, it is quite clear that the bureaus developed trade controls as&#13;
far as they could, limited only by their physical and human capacities&#13;
to produce those types of services. That those capacities were limited&#13;
is suggested by the fact that it was precisely the technical&#13;
difficulties of managing the quota system (especially after 1934) that&#13;
drove the bureaus themselves to ask the French government to limit the&#13;
expansion- of the administrative trade controls and, in 1939, even to&#13;
reduce the list of quotas.&#13;
There is a host of examples of the dominant role that some&#13;
bureaus currently play. At the EC level, the Commission's management of&#13;
the agricultural sector and the steel cartel are well-known cases.  At&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
national levels, the textile sector certainly exhibits the widest range&#13;
of subtle trade controls,  enforced by the bureaus.   Devices such as&#13;
France's so-called "surveillance statistique" allow the government to&#13;
increase the costs of imports and to slow them temporarily; two outcomes&#13;
are an increase in cheating and uncertainty about future imports.&#13;
The Workings of the Bureaucratic System&#13;
The   obvious   question   is   how   the   European   bureaus&#13;
(specifically, the top-level bureaucrats) have been able to become so&#13;
autonomous, to dominate decision-making on commercial policy and, in&#13;
part, to displace the politicians.&#13;
The first reason is to be found in the constitutional basis&#13;
for most European civil services, i.e., in the statutes establishing&#13;
civil  servants  (including  top-level  civil  servants).    The statutes&#13;
guarantee that a civil servant cannot be fired except for serious&#13;
incompetence or illegal acts.   A crucial point is that this guarantee&#13;
relates to the "career" and not the specific position held by the civil&#13;
servant /L Further, during the last 30 years, the practice has been to&#13;
restrict as much as possible a politician's ability to fire a civil&#13;
servant on grounds of incompetence or illegal acts.&#13;
On  the  other  hand,  the  statute  does  allow  for  a  civil&#13;
servant's transfer to another position when judged to be inefficient or&#13;
"undesirable"  in  the  current  position.    However,  this  threat  of&#13;
1/ It should be noted that European civil services differ fundamentally&#13;
from the U.S. civil service precisely because they are based on the&#13;
career (rank-in-man system) rather than the job (rank-in-job&#13;
system).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
displacement is the only pressure on a civil servant. When a top-level&#13;
bureaucrat is involved, even this option may be limited by the fact that&#13;
the transfer could easily appear to be political and could trigger&#13;
pressures from political parties and/or economic groups.&#13;
It is argued here that because of the statutes, the cost of&#13;
making decisions for a top-level bureaucrat desiring to become a&#13;
dominant decision-maker is lower than it would be under other&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
Politicians, for their part, have been doing their best to&#13;
adapt to this evolution.  For example, cabinets within ministries tend&#13;
to grow larger.   Obviously, an important part of the job of a civil&#13;
servant nominated to such a cabinet is to counter the influence of the&#13;
top-level bureaucrats in the Ministry and to introduce some kind of&#13;
flexibility and political flavor into decision-making. 1/&#13;
An additional point is that, since the beginning of the 1960s,&#13;
more and more European politicians have come from the bureaucracy 2/&#13;
Whatever the reasons for this trend, there have been two effects.&#13;
First, the bureaucrat-turned-politician tries to use the personal debts&#13;
accumulated during his years as civil servant. Frequently, he is biased&#13;
1/  An example is the Secretaire d'Etat aux Postes, T6l&amp;communications&#13;
et la T4l4diffusion (State Agency for the Post, Telecommunications&#13;
and Broadcasting), which is strongly involved in the telecommunica-&#13;
tions sector. See Le Monde, February 26, 1981.&#13;
2/ As a brief illustration, 55 percent of the French ministers came&#13;
from the top-level bureaucracy.  There was also a massive entry of&#13;
bureaucrats into the crucial Interministerial Committees at the&#13;
highest levels in West Germany, France and Italy, and even in the&#13;
United Kingdom, which so far seems to have been most reluctant to&#13;
follow this trend.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
toward solutions that use his knowledge of the bureaucratic process or&#13;
that give some role to the bureau from which he came. Second, the "road&#13;
to politics" is easier for a top-level bureaucrat who has had&#13;
opportunities to show his capacity as a decision-maker while managing a&#13;
bureau.  It is also true that it is easy to find examples of top-level&#13;
bureaucrats who are (were) considered as the "true" Minister because&#13;
they have (had) the confidence of the President or Prime Minister.&#13;
It should be noted that the statutes for the civil service in&#13;
the United Kingdom are substantially different from those in continental&#13;
Europe, a fact that may explain the differences in the roles played by&#13;
the bureaus in the latter.&#13;
Another  factor is also important.   As commercial policies&#13;
cause all kinds of problems -- financial, industrial and social -- the&#13;
choice of a trade policy, especially if fundamental decisions have to be&#13;
taken (e.g., freer trade vs. protection), always involves several&#13;
bureaus.    At  first  glance,  it would  seem that  some  kind  of fair&#13;
competition among the bureaus would result.   However,  that does not&#13;
appear to be the case.   Indeed, two well-established practices within&#13;
European bureaucracies have to be considered.   First, one bureau will&#13;
have the major role in defining the trade policy for a given industry,&#13;
and its role is more or less officially accepted by the other bureaus.&#13;
This "division of tasks" reduces the competition among the different&#13;
bureaus, especially when, as is often the case, the principal bureau has&#13;
played  this  role  for a long time.   This long-run stability exists&#13;
because changing the principal bureau is usually a costly process. It&#13;
also implies a redefinition of the roles of all the other bureaus, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
situation   that   could  lead  to  lengthy  log-rolling  within  the&#13;
bureaucracy l/&#13;
On the other hand, the second well-established practice&#13;
modifies the first one, and sometimes substantially.  The bureaucratic&#13;
system is not as centralized as is often believed.  Instead, it may be&#13;
viewed as a set of bureaus with weak inter-relationships, primarily&#13;
because of information costs. Consequently, when no formal hierarchical&#13;
relationship exists between the principal bureau and the others -- in&#13;
the most common case because all the bureaus are located in different&#13;
ministries -- a bureau which disagrees with the policy enforced by the&#13;
principal bureau may make its own policy choices, which it then enforces&#13;
itself.  Such competition often leads to innovations, with each bureau&#13;
seeking to "invent" new ways to enforce its objectives. It tries to use&#13;
techniques that are sufficiently secret (e.g., subsidies) that it can&#13;
escape accurate monitoring by other bureaus.&#13;
Nevertheless, the long-run stability is clearly a decisive&#13;
factor  in  explaining  the  role  of  bureaus  in  trade  policy.    This&#13;
stability allows a bureau to accumulate information on any industry and&#13;
to gain experience with it.  Slowly it is able to develop a comparative&#13;
advantage relative to politicians for solving the trade problems of that&#13;
industry.&#13;
1/ This long-run stability is often reinforced by the stability of the&#13;
civil  servants  working  within  the  bureau.          As  a  result,&#13;
relationships between a bureau and the industry it supervises often&#13;
involve the same people over a long period of time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
It is interesting to note that the bureaus which are con-&#13;
sidered as principal relative to trade policy are not generally&#13;
dependent on the Ministere du Commerce Ext6rieur (Ministry of Foreign&#13;
Trade) (in France it has been argued that this dependence has never&#13;
existed; see the Pisani report).- Indeed, the principal bureaus have&#13;
generally depended on the Ministry of Finance and/or Industry and/or&#13;
Agriculture,   the  so-called  bureaus  "de  tutelle"   (administrative&#13;
agencies) which have an extensive knowledge of the industries the&#13;
bureaus supervise.&#13;
The long-run stability not only creates favorable conditions&#13;
for the supply of protection, but also effects the demand for&#13;
protection.   Indeed,  at times  it may induce  lobbying  industries  to&#13;
invest more heavily in their relationships with the bureaus than with&#13;
politicians, as the bureaus, because of their stability, might be seen&#13;
as  providing  more  lasting  benefits  than  politicians  would.    This&#13;
situation is even more likely when relationships with the bureaus&#13;
involve fewer persons thanT relationships with politicians, or when the&#13;
political game entails many political parties, some of them small,&#13;
though possibly politically strategic.&#13;
Two final remarks are in order.  First, given the importance&#13;
of lobbying, it is possible for an industry to "capture" the bureau that&#13;
supervises it, just as it is said that regulated industries in the&#13;
1/ E. Pisani, "Rapport d'Information sur les Enjeux et Conditions des&#13;
Equilibres Exterieux de la France" [Information Report on the Stakes&#13;
and Conditions of France's External Equilibria], SMnat [Senate],&#13;
Paris, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
United States sometimes capture their regulators.I' A host of examples&#13;
of this "capturing" can be supplied.&#13;
This situation has nothing to do with corruption. An industry&#13;
may "capture" a major bureau in two quite legitimate ways.  The first&#13;
relates to the preparation of decisions concerning trade policies.   An&#13;
industry may give the bureau data and review the pros and cons of all&#13;
the possible technical means of protection.  Casual observation (of the&#13;
textile industry at the end of 1976-beginning of 1977, both at the&#13;
national and EC levels, and the steel industry two years after) suggests&#13;
that "captures" may result when fast, strong and relatively unexpected&#13;
increases in penetration ratios occur.&#13;
The second way relates to the enforcement of decisions by the&#13;
bureau. Some of the more subtle measures of trade control (such as the&#13;
verification of the origin of imports) require some input from industry,&#13;
as illustrated recently by the protective measures for the textile&#13;
sector in France 2/&#13;
A final point is that the bureaucratic case amounts to a&#13;
special   instance  of  the  rent-seeking  process  first  analyzed   by&#13;
Krueger 31  The inclusion  of bureaus,  however, makes  the rent-seeking&#13;

process very complex and leads to an ambiguous result. On the one hand,&#13;
it is easy to understand why bureaus might themselves be interested in&#13;
rent-seeking .l1 For instance, the survival of the industry can make the&#13;
survival of the bureau supervising it more probable. On the other hand,&#13;
it may also be observed that bureaus will try to stop the rent-seeking&#13;
process, at least in part, if that process brings about demands for&#13;
protection that exceed their production capacities. This important kind&#13;
of phenomenon was mentioned in the discussion of French trade policy at&#13;
the end of the 1930s, when the bureaus exerted pressure to reduce the&#13;
list of quotas.&#13;
1/ The fact that bureaus are rent-seekers does not mean that the&#13;
individual bureaucrats working in those bureaus can enjoy the&#13;
"collective" rents (although wages for top-level bureaucrats are&#13;
sufficiently differentiated as to incorporate some elements of the&#13;
bureau's quasi-rents).&#13;

Chapter III&#13;
BUREAUS AND THE CONSERVATIVE SOCIAL WELFARE FUNCTION&#13;
Not surprisingly, the concept of a social welfare function&#13;
(SWF)  will  be helpful  in analyzing  bureaucratic  behavior.    It  is&#13;
necessary to examine carefully the conditions under which a bureau is&#13;
able to develop its SWF since, as emphasized by Buchanan.', it must act&#13;
within the limits imposed by its mandate.&#13;
What, then, are the main limits to be considered?  First, a&#13;
bureau has the power to make decisions only on a specific set of&#13;
issues. Note that a politician, to the contrary, may do so for a whole&#13;
range of economic issues.   This difference is crucial, since it gives&#13;
politicians  opportunities  for  survival  that  are  unavailable  to&#13;
bureaus.    It  is  easier  for  a  politician  to  compensate  for  the&#13;
difficulties on one issue by promoting another:  if a tariff problem is&#13;
politically messy, he can focus on other issues that are politically&#13;
easier to handle but have the same expected (allegedly) redistributive&#13;
consequences for voters. Further, each bureau has only a specific range&#13;
of means at its disposal, which may not have been defined logically&#13;
relative to the issues. Rather, they may have been inherited or are the&#13;
consequence of the task specialization between bureaus. Politicians, on&#13;
the  other  hand,  normally  have  access  to  all  legal  measures.    A&#13;
politician who was not able to get a tariff to protect an industry in&#13;
his district can then try to obtain public contracts, military camps or&#13;
whatever and will be able to argue convincingly that these measures&#13;

would increase the level of activity of the depressed regiond.' More&#13;
important still, it is easy to see that politicians have more latitude&#13;
than bureaucrats for capturing the profits created by protection, as&#13;
will be discussed in Chapter IV.&#13;
It is therefore appropriate to define a bureau as only a&#13;
"partial dictator" because of the limitations on its sphere of issues&#13;
and means.   This concept of a partial dictatorship will allow more&#13;
concrete substance to be given to the concept of the conservative social&#13;
welfare function (CSWF) suggested by Corden2/ and to develop some new&#13;
arguments on the issue of the optimal tariff.&#13;
The Partial Dictatorship and the CSWF&#13;
This subsection focuses on the differences between the&#13;
dictator as generally considered in the orthodox theory of protection --&#13;
the so-called "benevolent despot" -- and the partial dictator of a&#13;
bureaucracy.&#13;
The "dictator" of economic theory is able to maintain a&#13;
Pareto-optimal solution whatever the shape of his SWF because he can use&#13;
the whole range of redistribution measures to enforce his choices. Even&#13;
if the dictator has a "conservative" SWF -- according to Corden, "any&#13;
1/ This point is very important and suggests that the assumption&#13;
usually made in presentations on the political economy of protection&#13;
that tariffs are the only instrument of protection is not correct&#13;
(although   relaxing   this   assumption   introduces   analytical&#13;
difficulties). Instead, politicians have to be judged on an average&#13;
rate of success.  This interpretation makes more plausible the view&#13;
that politicians can be considered as monopolists on the tariff&#13;
issue (see Chapter IV).&#13;

absolute reduction in real income in any section of the economy should&#13;
be avoided" -- he may still choose a free trade solution combined with&#13;
an adequate system of lump sum transfers. In other words, a CSWF is not&#13;
a sufficient condition for protection, given the usual framework but&#13;
assuming a dictator.&#13;
The problem may be easily illustrated using the extreme case&#13;
of a small economy where some factors are specific to the production of&#13;
imported and exported goods. A policy change from autarky to free trade&#13;
will shift the utility possibility frontier outwards. This new frontier&#13;
is shown by TF in Figure 1. Call A the initial situation under autarky,&#13;
and F the final one under free trade.  As a policy change toward free&#13;
trade will unambiguously hurt all the specific factors employed in the&#13;
import-competing sector, the aggregated utility of all these factors, as&#13;
measured along the UM axis, decreases when the economy moves from A to&#13;
F.  This result may be unacceptable to the dictator if he has a CSWF.&#13;
Consequently, he has to move along TF to reach acceptable points. The&#13;
point FM corresponds to the- first acceptable situation.   The segment&#13;
FmFX of the frontier is the locus of points which is acceptable to the&#13;
dictator. However, this definition does not exclude some convexity for&#13;
the indifference curves situated to the right of FMAFX.   The optimal&#13;
point for the dictator will be located somewhere between FM and Fx, at&#13;
F', for instance, implying some level of lump sum transfers.&#13;
Now assume a bureau, BM, in charge of import-competing&#13;
industry M, and another bureau, Bx, in charge of export industry X.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Nothing new will occur if the bureaucratic organization is ideal, which&#13;
means there will be full cooperation between BM and Bx at zero&#13;
transaction cost.   In other words, all the points between FM and Fx&#13;
remain attainable, including Fx, the point at which bureau BM appro-&#13;
priates all the gains from trade using transfers. Further, BM is giving&#13;
all the gains from free trade to the factors of production hired by&#13;
industry M (industry X is assumed to be indifferent between A (autarky)&#13;
and Fx).&#13;
There   is,   in   reality,   no   such   ideal   bureaucratic&#13;
organization.   Cooperation between bureaus is generally difficult to&#13;
achieve as it involves transaction costs.  To avoid such costs, bureau&#13;
BM may prefer to use the limited range of means it dominates to&#13;
implement the "rights to be protected" that it decides to impose. Since&#13;
a bureau in charge of commercial policy seldom has the jurisdiction to&#13;
organize lump sum transfers, it will not consider the TF frontier to be&#13;
attainable, since TF is outside its set of possible means of&#13;
redistribution.    Alternatively,  the  bureau  will  only  consider  the&#13;
utility possibility frontiers available with the redistribution schemes&#13;
it can effectively enforce (possibly with minimal cooperation from&#13;
Bx).   Therefore  assume  the simplest  case,  in which bureau BM can&#13;
redistribute in favor of industry M only by imposing a tariff; under&#13;
such a trade policy, the attainable utility frontier is illustrated by&#13;
FT'.   However, where cooperation between the bureaus is poor, a chain&#13;
reaction develops -- after BM has made decisions aimed at improving the&#13;
situation of the import-competing industry, Bx moves to avoid a decrease&#13;
in the output share of the export industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
This case will be returned to later when the spread of&#13;
protection is considered.  In the meantime, assume that each bureau is&#13;
small enough to take as given the decisions of the other bureaus. Under&#13;
this assumption, the only utility function which plays a role in the&#13;
above framework is the utility function of bureau BM, which is now&#13;
specified.&#13;
Although the relationships between a bureau and the industry&#13;
it supervises are complex, the survival and the prestige of a bureau are&#13;
as a rule correlated with the existence and size of the industry it&#13;
supervises.-.    Consequently, the bureau may be permanently induced to&#13;
identify its own utility with that of the factors of production hired by&#13;
the industry it supervises.   This evolution is strengthened by the&#13;
tendency of a bureau to make decisions in a partial equilibrium&#13;
framework that is restricted to the industry it supervises. 2/&#13;
This analysis can be expanded somewhat by taking into account&#13;
the "prestige" component of BM's utility, derived from its power and&#13;
effectiveness.   To gain prestige,  BM may try to protect the import-&#13;
competing industry vigorously: it will seek to increase UM more than UX&#13;
(starting from any point to the left of FMAAm, the "limit" indifference&#13;
1/ It may be added that a bureau may link its survival and prestige to&#13;
the existence of "national" firms.   Foreign firms, even if they&#13;
produce in the domestic economy, are presumably associated with a&#13;
decrease in the role of the bureau.&#13;
2/ One of the most illustrative examples is the amazing role of&#13;
sectoral trade balances as a guide for policy.   See, for example,&#13;
the campaign for the "Reconquete du marche interieur" [Recapturing&#13;
the domestic market] in France since mid-1979, which is mainly based&#13;
on evidence concerning trade balances.  This bureaucratic myopia is&#13;
reinforced by the vertical structure of the bureaucracy and by the&#13;
great difficulties the bureaus have in working together (sharing&#13;
information, defining common goals, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

curve when BM has a CSWF). In other words, the complete CSWF of BM may&#13;
be illustrated by a set of indifference curves similar to B which&#13;
exhibit a relatively "flat" gradient in any point.&#13;
As a result, bureau BM will "optimally" favor the tariff&#13;
solution, which allows a shift from A to some point L on FT'. Point L&#13;
will be close to M if prestige plays an important role in the BM's&#13;
behavior.  Reaching point L depends on several factors:  the rights to&#13;
be protected that are enjoyed by the import-competing industry, the&#13;
bureau's means of enforcing these rights, the prestige component of the&#13;
bureau's utility, and the imperfect cooperation between the bureaus&#13;
involved.    Further,  point  L  will  remain  stable  only  under  two&#13;
assumptions: the small bureau one, according to which the only utility&#13;
function involved is BM's, and the small country one, according to which&#13;
bureau BM imposes a level of protection higher than the optimal one&#13;
(which is zero, i.e., free trade).&#13;
It is important to note, as well, the effect of administrative&#13;
organization on trade policy.  If the division of means between bureaus&#13;
does not change, the trade liberalization observed between A and some&#13;
point on the frontier FT' (say L) will probably stop definitively at&#13;
that point (all other things being constant).   If, however, a bureau&#13;
finds itself with new means of making transfers efficiently, its&#13;
feasibility utility frontier will shift toward TF through a freer trade&#13;
policy. In other words, a broad definition of the means available to a&#13;
bureau may  foster a trade  liberalization  process.    This point may&#13;
constitute part of the answer to the question raised by Waelbroeck and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Verreydtl-. namely, why "decisions taken at higher decision levels tend&#13;
to be more liberal than the blow by blow decisions of the bureaus." It&#13;
is argued here that people at the higher decision levels have available&#13;
to them more means than do the basic bureaus and therefore may consider&#13;
utility possibility frontiers more favorable than that of the bureau.&#13;
The Spread of Protection&#13;
Imperfect cooperation between bureaus, and the possibility of&#13;
something like a chain reaction, were suggested above.   It should be&#13;
noted that the consequent instability is not inconsistent with the&#13;
hierarchical organization of a bureaucracy. Consider the following. It&#13;
might be argued that any conflict between BM and BX will automatically&#13;
be solved through arbitration at a higher level of decision. However,&#13;
as shown by Finger, Hall and Nelson 2/ to involve the highest public&#13;
authorities on specific problems will not necessarily mean stable&#13;
decision-making, since, at the highest political levels, "the clearest&#13;
pressures may be away from a decision, not toward either a yes or a&#13;
no." Consequently, the conflict between bureaus may persist even within&#13;
a hierarchical organization.&#13;
Still more important, the imperfect cooperation between&#13;
bureaus will play a crucial role in an important phenomenon, called here&#13;
the "spread of protection." Indeed, an interesting feature in the&#13;
history of protection is the observed spread of protective decisions&#13;
over all industries during some periods in a given country.&#13;

A first  explanation  might  be found  in some  international&#13;
process of retaliation against "beggar-my-neighbor" policies.  Although&#13;
sometimes present, this explanation does not seem to be either the&#13;
unique or even the main one.&#13;
Rather than relying on external reasons, the answer must be&#13;
sought internally -- with the bargaining situation. The two hypotheses&#13;
discussed below are alternative explanations -- one assumes perfect&#13;
information  on  the  part  of  those  concerned  about  protectionist&#13;
decisions, while the other assumes there is no information.&#13;
The first hypothesis, which is also discussed by Waelbroeck&#13;
and Verreydt 1/ assumes "perfect" information by all about the results&#13;
of lobbying  for protection.   In such a case, any concession to a&#13;
protectionist pressure group will result in familiar responses by other&#13;
pressure  groups,  responses  somewhat  dreaded  by  bureaucrats:    "If&#13;
industry X gets protection, why not me?" In other words, the concession&#13;
may be viewed as creating an externality which decreases the cost of&#13;
lobbying for other interest groups.   The decrease in the cost will be&#13;
quite large if the industries asking for protection are supervised by&#13;
different bureaus for the following reason -- log-rolling between&#13;
bureaus lessens the ability of each to resist industry pressures.-2&#13;
1/  Op. cit., Waelbroeck and Verreydt.&#13;
2/  It is considerations such as this, on the other hand, that motivated&#13;
the French delegation during the negotiation of the Treaty of Rome&#13;
(those involved were top-level civil servants).  The French tried to&#13;
minimize the "exceptions" to the general rules of European trade&#13;
liberalization precisely to help top-level French bureaucrats in&#13;
confronting lobbying industries at the end of the 1950s.  The "no&#13;
exception"  rule was a crucial ingredient in the success of the&#13;
Treaty of Rome.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
A good illustration of this hypothesis may be observed in the&#13;
current French and European situations. The automobile sector in France&#13;
got relatively fast and strong support against Japan -- Japanese cars&#13;
were limited to a 3 percent market share. Additionally, 19 Japanese car&#13;
models were not, and still are not, officially cleared for sale by the&#13;
appropriate bureau in Ministere de l'Industrie (Ministry of Industry).&#13;
Measures against Japanese cars subsequently spread to the entire EC.&#13;
The success of the automobile industry helped other industries such as&#13;
machine tools and consumer electronics to obtain stronger protection.&#13;
The second hypothesis assumes a kind of non-cooperative&#13;
competition  between  a  country's  free  trade  advocates  and  its&#13;
protectionists.    Bureaus  presumably  play  a  crucial  role  in  this&#13;
competition.   Consider two scenarios.   In the first, which has been&#13;
observed in the past in some European countries, both importing and&#13;
exporting industries lobby for more protection.  Such behavior may seem&#13;
puzzling, since protection works by changing the relative prices of&#13;
imports and exports. Export subsidies and import tariff changes could&#13;
even cancel out, leaving the domestic price ratio equal to the&#13;
international one.&#13;
These scenarios illuminate the contradiction which may exist&#13;
between the economic rationality of agents acting as individuals, or as&#13;
members of a cooperating group.   In the economic literature, this has&#13;
come to be called "the prisoner's dilemma," following the presentation&#13;
of Rapoport and Chammah. .1/ However, the problem is a general one. It&#13;

arises whenever it is in the interest of each member of a group, acting&#13;
alone,  to make decisions which are harmful to other members.   It is&#13;
clear that in such cases, cooperative behavior will often be far&#13;
preferable to each member of the group than that which would be obtained&#13;
if everyone acted selfishly.   However, that cooperation will be very&#13;
hard to sustain, because it is in the interest of each agent to cheat on&#13;
the collectively optimal rule of conduct. -&#13;
1/ Chapter II presented some institutional motives and examples of the&#13;
difficult communications among bureaus.   A typical example is the&#13;
case of the Fonds de Developpement Economique et Social (FDES) (Fund&#13;
for Economic and Social Development).  The FDES is the main bureau&#13;
that gives  subsidies  to industry.   Since  1977, politicians have&#13;
tried unsuccessfully to get detailed figures on these subsidies.&#13;
The Conseil d'Etat [State Council] claimed that the figures it&#13;
provided (which are difficult to interpret) were a "sufficient piece&#13;
of information" for Parliament.&#13;

Chapter IV&#13;
BUREAUS VS. POLITICIANS&#13;
In the preceding section, it was argued that bureaus probably&#13;
impose a higher level of protection than the theoretically optimal&#13;
one.  This section compares how the two main groups in charge of trade&#13;
policy  in  democracies  --  namely,  politicians  and  bureaucrats  --&#13;
operate I/&#13;
Consider  two  situations.    In  the  first,  politicians  are&#13;
dominant, with the bureaus unable to pursue their own objectives during&#13;
decision-making; this is the situation described by U.S. economists. In&#13;
the second case, bureaucrats are dominant, with politicians playing only&#13;
the role of the "driving belt" between industries and bureaus, as may be&#13;
the case in France. The question here is whether one of these decision&#13;
systems is more likely to be systematically biased toward protection&#13;
than the other.&#13;
The preceding sections provide some insight. Politicians can&#13;
be expected to have utility functions correlated with those  of the&#13;
1/  It may seem like an exaggeration to discuss politicians and bureaus&#13;
as opposing each other; it might be more accurate to speak of&#13;
"bundles" of politicians and bureaus, with different relative&#13;
endowments depending on the country. This distinction permits more&#13;
subtle and perhaps more accurate reasoning in terms of the relative&#13;
rivalries  between  politicians  and  bureaus.    Moreover,  such  an&#13;
approach takes into account "private bureaucracies" -- for example,&#13;
the U.S. steel producers, who complain about European dumping and&#13;
carry out very well the job that might be played in Europe by&#13;
bureaus.   However, for the sake of simplicity, these nuances have&#13;
been ignored by considering a transformation surface which would&#13;
allow all the different kinds of factors in the production of&#13;
protection to be taken into account.  Finally, competition between&#13;
politicians and bureaus is excluded.&#13;

voters and may appear a priori to be less dependent on one industry than&#13;
bureaus are.   Normally, they may also have access to a broader set of&#13;
means than the bureaus do, and consequently may be more easily&#13;
considered as a "collective dictator." Such arguments tend to interpret&#13;
politicians as more liberal than bureaus.   There are exceptions, of&#13;
course.   For example,, if there is a regional concentration of certain&#13;
industries or firms, local politicians are going to be very sensitive to&#13;
that. It therefore seems reasonable to focus on bureaus and politicians&#13;
in terms of their two crucial potential impacts as producers of&#13;
1/&#13;
protection.-&#13;
A first question is whether the ability of each institution to&#13;
claim a share of the profit generated by its activity has any impact on&#13;
the level of protection produced for industry i.   To simplify the&#13;
analysis, it is first assumed that only one means of protection is&#13;
available.    Then,  to  examine how  the  rivalry  between bureaus  and&#13;
politicians affects protection, a situation in which there are several&#13;
protection devices is considered.&#13;
In both cases, as is shown below, the bureaus prove to be more&#13;
biased toward protection than politicians do.&#13;
Bureaus Vs. Politicians: The Case of One Means of Protection&#13;
This case assumes only one device for protection (for&#13;
instance,  tariffs).    Consider  an industry observing  (or expecting)&#13;

to produce a purely neutral analysis of these two institutions,&#13;

as firms producing a (peculiar) public good.&#13;

increases in the domestic market penetration of foreign competitors.&#13;
Assume that it wants to minimize this penetration and therefore lobbies&#13;
for -- and gets -- a tariff which provides the desired decrease.  The&#13;
money and effort invested in the lobbying can be expressed as a function&#13;
of the percentage points of the market share to be recovered, as tariff&#13;
increases will raise the profits of domestic producers. There will be a&#13;
relevant range over which the marginal benefits to the industry can be&#13;
considered as a decreasing function of protection.1.  Over this range,&#13;
the relation, which has negative slope, can be interpreted as the demand&#13;
curve for protection.&#13;
To simplify this case, assume that industry expresses the same&#13;
demand for protection whether it is politicians or bureaus in charge of&#13;
deciding the level of protection.  This assumption is plausible if the&#13;
demand for protection is understood as a derived demand in the sense&#13;
that the import-competing firms are demanding from the factors of&#13;
production (bureaus or politicians) the services (protection) that the&#13;
firms believe are necessary in order to recover their former market&#13;
shares.&#13;
Turning to the supply side, assume that the same cost for&#13;
production of protection (tariffs) will prevail in both cases.   This&#13;
assumption is realistic, since an essential part of these costs is the&#13;
result of implementing the decisions, and this depends little on whether&#13;
politicians or bureaucrats are in charge.   Finally, assume temporarily&#13;
1/ Such a range will eventually be reached as the protected domestic&#13;
suppliers saturate the domestic market (assuming competition).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
that the involved politicians or bureaucrats experience no rivalry from&#13;
other politicians or bureaucrats respectively (a situation considered in&#13;
the next subsection).  The next step is to define the supply behaviors&#13;
of the bureaus and politicians.&#13;
Consider first the bureau.  The amount of protection it will&#13;
produce will obviously depend on its assumed objective -- to expand its&#13;
power as far as possible through its actions.   Such a case can be&#13;
analyzed using Niskanen's approach 1/ a bureau will try to maximize its&#13;
budget because it cannot capture the profits generated by its&#13;
decisions.  This is because the civil service regulations are designed&#13;
to prevent a bureaucrat's access to the wealth of the bureau.   This&#13;
point is crucial, since it means that the maximization of profits&#13;
(wealth) by bureaucrats is unattractive and that there must be another&#13;
objective such as budget-maximizing. In the case of top-level European&#13;
bureaucrats, this inability to capture the profits seems to be supported&#13;
by the fact that they do not generally leave the civil service for&#13;
industry 2/&#13;
Thus, if X is the demand curve, as illustrated in Figure 2, a&#13;
Niskanen-type bureau will produce an amount of protection equal to QN,&#13;
where the marginal cost is equal to the so-called "all-or-nothing"&#13;

demand curve, DF ./ This DF curve shows the maximum price the import-&#13;
competing industry is willing to pay for a given amount of protection&#13;
(or the acceptable tariff level), assuming that the bureau offers&#13;
industry  two  alternatives:    free  trade  or  the  given  amount  of&#13;
protection.&#13;
It may be askgd how a bureau can have such monopolistic&#13;
power.   One reason is -that the bureau could deprive the industry of&#13;
valuable services (for instance, the collection and provision of data on&#13;
domestic market penetration, efficient controls at customs stations,&#13;
subsidies, etc.) unless the industry were paying the full price.&#13;
An alternative objective for a bureau is as follows. Instead&#13;
of trying to maximize its budget and accepting the implied strong&#13;
constraints on the amount and use of its managerial discretion-2/ a&#13;
bureau may seek a "quiet life" and accept some X-inefficiency.  There&#13;
1/  In this case, some care has to be taken over who is expressing the&#13;
demand. In the familiar Niskanen model, demand is expressed by the&#13;
politicians who sponsor the bureaus. This view is accurate if it is&#13;
assumed that the demand for protection as expressed by the&#13;
politicians is nothing more than the demand expressed by the factors&#13;
of production of the import-competing industry and transmitted by&#13;
the politician without any change.&#13;
Is such a role plausible for politicians? The answer is yes,&#13;
at least during some periods.  In an institutional system in which&#13;
the bureaus are effectively in charge of policy-making, politicians&#13;
may have only an "informative" role and may have no real motive to&#13;
do costly (for them) arbitrating between the buyers of protection --&#13;
the factors of production in the import industry -- and the&#13;
consumers.    However,  in  such  a  case,  it  is  likely  that  the&#13;
"informative" role of the politicians will rarely be known by the&#13;
voters except when they themselves are the factors, so that this&#13;
role has no negative consequences in terms of votes for politicians.&#13;

Discretion," Public Choice XVII(Spring 1974):27-43.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
are many ways to do that.  One of the most plausible is for the bureau&#13;
to obtain from its regulatory authority (politicians and top-level&#13;
bureaucrats) some recognition in setting its budget of the "fair costs"&#13;
of its operations, i.e., including such factors as prestige, power,&#13;
direct and indirect revenues, etc., which the bureaucrats desire and can&#13;
1/&#13;
appropriate.-   In such a case, the bureau will work as any regulated&#13;
public utility that enjoys a "fair rate of return."  That is, it will&#13;
produce tariffs until the average cost intersects with the Marshallian&#13;
demand for protection, DM, i.e., it will produce QM.  It can be seen&#13;
that QN &gt; QM, a result that depends on the U-shaped cost curves.&#13;
Indeed, empirical evidence suggests unambiguously that the average cost&#13;
of enforcement increases in the relevant range.&#13;
Consider  now  the  politician's  case.         There  are  two&#13;
scenarios. The first is that, unlike bureaucrats, politicians are able&#13;
to capture some of the differences between the costs incurred and the&#13;
services produced, although their right to claim the profits generated&#13;
by their decisions is probably limited. They may receive personal gain,&#13;
or secure campaign contributions  or other types of support.   This&#13;
ability is reinforced by the fact that, as a rule, a lobbying industry&#13;
will not invest in just any politician, but rather will choose&#13;
"political  stars"  or  at  least  "experienced"  politicians.    (This&#13;
difference in their ability to capture quasi-rents is the only&#13;
1/  An alternative way would be to examine the "managerial efforts" of&#13;
the bureau.   This could be made within the framework suggested in&#13;
Section II of J. P. Martin, "X-Inefficiency, Managerial Effort and&#13;
Protection," Economica (45)(August 1978):273-286.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
difference  between  politicians  and  bureaucrats  considered  here.)&#13;
Provisionally, politicians are assumed to be monopolists.   Although it&#13;
is true that, with respect to voters, incumbent politicians are in a&#13;
competitive market, the evidence suggests that, for "experienced"&#13;
politicians, the level of competition is not as high as it is sometimes&#13;
said to bed.'&#13;
Consider first a politician who has bargaining power as a&#13;
discriminating monopolist, so that the Marshallian demand curve, DM, is&#13;
his  marginal  revenue  curve.    This  politician produces  a  level  of&#13;
protection,  PN 21   Clearly PN &lt; QN.   Thus, bureaus are more biased&#13;
toward protection than politicians, who are discriminating monopolists.&#13;
Now assume the second scenario -- a politician without strong&#13;
bargaining power. He will act as a monopolist, producing at PM.&#13;
When non-discriminating politicians and bureaus are compared,&#13;
it is again apparent that bureaus are biased in favor of protection,&#13;
since PM &lt; QM-&#13;
1/ Long political careers might be seen either as the product of&#13;
efficiency or a lack of competition. This second explanation cannot&#13;
be ignored in Europe.   The parties are highly organized, and a&#13;
European politician who has not been elected as a representative can&#13;
play an important role in national political life as long as he&#13;
plays an important role in his party.   Second, there are familiar&#13;
techniques for suppressing competition between politicians belonging&#13;
to the same party and who are at first sight close substitutes:&#13;
they involve "electoral fiefs" or the assignment of distinct roles&#13;
within the party.&#13;
2/ *For a similar problem, see R. G. Holcombe and E. 0. Price,&#13;
"Optimality and the Institutional Structure of Bureaucracy," Public&#13;
Choice l(33)(1978):55-59.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
The conclusion, then, is that given identical conditions of&#13;
discrimination, a bureau will choose a higher level of protection than&#13;
will  a  politician.    This  is because  of a basic  (and unavoidable)&#13;
characteristic of bureaus -- their inability to capture quasi-rents.&#13;
Bureaus Vs. Politicians: The Case of Several Means of Protection&#13;
So far it has been assumed that the politicians and bureaus in&#13;
charge of commercial policy act as pure monopolists.   However, it is&#13;
clear  that      rivalry  (or    competition)  sometimes  exists  among&#13;
politicians,  as well as among bureaucrats.1!   Brock and Magee have&#13;
interpreted  the rivalry among  politicians as  generating competitive&#13;
pressure. They have suggested some interesting results in the case of a&#13;
duopolistic market for politicians.   In particular, they showed that&#13;
"the more competitive the political system, the more likely it is that&#13;
distribution questions will dominate efficiency considerations."&#13;
What is the nature of the rivalry between bureaus?  In Chapter&#13;
III, it was argued that a bureau is only a partial dictator in that it&#13;
has a limited range of means. However, a bureau can always expand this&#13;
range somewhat or use its means extensively in order to have some&#13;
influence   over   problems   which   were   "a   priori"   outside   its&#13;
jurisdiction.   For instance, a bureau in charge of social affairs may&#13;
lobby for an early retirement scheme in an import-competing industry, a&#13;
benefit  that could have a strong impact on commercial policy.   For&#13;
example,  consider the first Davignon Plan (of 1978).   To solve the&#13;

problem of the excess labor force, the bureaus of social affairs pushed&#13;
the idea of a fifth team in steel plants. Obviously, this "fifth team"&#13;
would have had a crucial impact on the EC's international steel policy&#13;
by raising production costs, probably making it more protectionist.&#13;
Thus one aspect of the rivalry among bureaus is attempts by new bureaus&#13;
to enter into a problem involving one or several traditional bureaus by&#13;
defining and using new means, or by using old means in a new way.&#13;
Clearly, this entry is motivated by a desire to be involved in that&#13;
problem. There is a large range of motives, among them, for example, to&#13;
maximize prestige or secure the survival or growth of the bureau.&#13;
However, the main point is the crucial role that the means available to&#13;
a bureau play in the competition among bureaus.&#13;
A bureau may also try to escape the competitive pressures by a&#13;
policy of "differentiating" the product it produces; it will choose a&#13;
l"specific" means of protection in order to increase its monopolistic&#13;
power over the commercial policy it defines for the industry it&#13;
supervises.l/&#13;
Obviously, such a policy of differentiation means that bureaus&#13;
will be strongly motivated to prefer NTBs to tariffs, since monitoring&#13;
of the former by others is more difficult.21 To illustrate this point,&#13;
consider such NTBs as quality control for agricultural imports, the&#13;
1/  The word "specific" has the same significance as in the expression&#13;
"specific" factors.&#13;
2/  For instance, subsidies given by bureaus in the Ministry of Industry&#13;
can be easily monitored by bureaus in the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(Treasury).   Indeed, NTBs might be seen as the best means for the&#13;
"technical" ministries (industry, transportation, agriculture, etc.)&#13;
to escape the influence of the powerful Ministry of Finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
definition  of  industrial  norms,  or  public  purchases.    Such  NTBs&#13;
introduce enormous problems of measurement and evaluation that require&#13;
technical skills not present within the bureaus trying to solve the&#13;
problem, even the principal bureau, leaving room for discretionary&#13;
judgements.   Notice that this trend is not especially novel.  Bureaus&#13;
have understood since early on that ad valorem tariffs are more&#13;
difficult to monitor than specific tariffs, since they are based on&#13;
price evaluations for imported goods; those evaluations can be very&#13;
controversial, requiring technical skills and information.&#13;
The main consequence of this policy of differentiation may be&#13;
the result pointed out earlier -- a bias of bureaus toward protection, a&#13;
result that is more likely to occur with differentiated means of&#13;
protection than without them.  That outcome is attributable to the fact&#13;
that differentiation is much easier for bureaus to work with than for&#13;
politicians, since NTBs require both time and technical skills,&#13;
resources that politicians cannot easily provide at a sufficient&#13;
level.   Thus, in addition to their well-known "qualities" from the&#13;
external point of view -- namely, that NTBs are more difficult to&#13;
control by other countries and are less subject to international&#13;
agreements than tariffs are -- NTBs also present internal advantages, at&#13;
least for bureaus.&#13;
With respect to the initial problem -- the different impact&#13;
that bureaucrats and politicians have on the level of protection -- some&#13;
doubts may be raised about the validity of the usual theoretical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
conclusion1/ that subsidies are preferable to tariffs. This conclusion&#13;
depends on the assumption that the protection effects of the devices&#13;
considered are equal.   However, that assumption is in doubt if, for&#13;
legal  reasons,   tariffs  are  more  clearly  the  responsibility  of&#13;
politicians through legislative procedures than are other barriers to&#13;
imports.   It might be better to choose tariffs rather than subsidies,&#13;
simply because they are less responsive to manipulation by bureaus,&#13;
whose protectionist biases have been discussed.&#13;
Are NTBs always favorable to the industry the bureau&#13;
supervises? This question remains open. The industry may expect better&#13;
control through NTBs than through a tariff system because the former&#13;
involve technical observations and questions that really can only be&#13;
provided by the firms or professional associations.   This gives them&#13;
some scope to control and orient the bureau.   However, it should be&#13;
stressed that the splintering of trade policies into tariffs and&#13;
multiple NTBs makes it very difficult for firms to measure the effective&#13;
rates of protection they face.  The result may be errors of judgement,&#13;
and even an over-investment in lobbying.&#13;
In addition to this basic problem, it may be asked if the&#13;
power of the industry to monitor and control NTB protection is not&#13;
transitory. The industry cannot avoid giving crucial information to the&#13;
bureau.  Over time, the bureau will have accumulated substantial know-&#13;
ledge and may become harder to convince.  At some time the bureau may&#13;
even discover and seek to rectify abuses in a way the industry dislikes.&#13;

INFORMATION COSTS AND THE BIAS TOWARD PROTECTION&#13;
Information  costs  were  suggested   earlier  as  a  basic&#13;
explanation  for  protection.-    However,  the costs analyzed related&#13;
specifically to those experienced by consumers or voters, and it was&#13;
noted that consumers may not be able to relate observed increases in&#13;
prices to protectionist measures.   Even if they could do so, it might&#13;
not be worth their while to oppose the measures if only a small fraction&#13;
of their total expenditure is involved.&#13;
A different issue was investigated here: do information costs&#13;
increase or decrease the bias of bureaus toward protection?   It is&#13;
argued that they are likely to increase it, presumably strongly.&#13;
Begin by considering the familiar theoretical analysis of a&#13;
change in the tariff level, such as a decrease, in a partial equilibrium&#13;
framework.  The decrease will generate two opposing forces:  gains for&#13;
consumers, to be estimated by the present value of the familiar&#13;
deadweight gains, and the social costs of decreased protection for the&#13;
factors of production hired by the import-competing industry.  How can&#13;
these social costs be defined, if there is no awareness of the loss of&#13;
tariff revenue?&#13;
A first definition was suggested by Magee 2/&#13;
ae-.   the social costs&#13;
are to be estimated as the present value of "the costs of moving&#13;

resources out of import-competing production and into other areas."&#13;
Baldwin, Mutti and RichardsonL/ showed that the existence of adjustment&#13;
costs (as defined by Magee) "does not necessarily result in a net&#13;
welfare cost of tariff reduction to the economy."  Casual observation&#13;
suggests that bureaus generally use something like the Magee definition,&#13;
which is easy to develop in a partial equilibrium framework.&#13;
A bureau will favor freer trade only when the net marginal&#13;
welfare gains (estimated in terms of a partial equilibrium) remain&#13;
positive.   As  soon as they become negative,  the bureau will favor&#13;
protection. Figure 3 represents the situation as the bureau perceives&#13;
it.   At point Tel the net marginal welfare gains, assuming perfect&#13;
information,  are  zero.    The  tariff  change  ATe  will  give  a  new&#13;
equilibrium tariff, Tel to be imposed by the bureau; it is obtained by&#13;
reducing the initial tariff T by a proportion ATe* This tariff change&#13;
is optimal for the bureau since it maximizes the net welfare gains from&#13;
trade liberalization&amp;2/   Is Te optimal?   This depends on whether the&#13;
curves in Figure 3 are properly perceived by the bureau.&#13;

zero)  is  the  optimal  tariff  change  in  a  general  equilibrium&#13;
framework for a small country. The tariff change ATe is the result&#13;
of the limited rationality of the bureau and its willingness to&#13;
organize compensation between the gainers and losers from free trade&#13;
within a partial equilibrium framework.&#13;

Bureaus as Information Producers&#13;
Will the bureau produce directly its own estimates of the&#13;
social gains and losses created by the tariff change?  It may be that,&#13;
because of practical problems, the costs of obtaining that information&#13;
are high. Each firm does not use exactly the same technology, so that&#13;
the effective rates of protection will be different for each.  Further,&#13;
protection induces smuggling, errors, briberies and fraud of all&#13;
kinds. Thus, in practice the bureau may not be able to provide such&#13;
estimates  easily.      The  information  costs  therefore  may  not  be&#13;
negligible, and as they have to be deducted from the net welfare gains,&#13;
the tariff, T', imposed by the bureau will be higher than the&#13;
equilibrium tariff, Te.&#13;
It is likely that a bureau can more easily collect data on the&#13;
costs for factors of production than on the gains for consumers. As a&#13;
result, their assessment of the latter will be too low, leading to an&#13;
underestimation of the net welfare gains. Here, T' will be imposed&#13;
instead of Te (that is, the tariff change AT' will be chosen instead of&#13;
ATe) )/&#13;
1/ A simple example may be given. During the late 19th and early 20th&#13;
centuries, the debates between protectionists and free traders in&#13;
France were dominated by the controversy about trade balances.  As&#13;
A. Arnaume ("Le Commerce Ext6rieur et les Tarifs de Douane" [Foreign&#13;
Trade and Customs Tariffs], Paris: F. Alcan, 1911) reported, imports&#13;
were probably slightly undervalued (3 percent), exports highly&#13;
undervalued (5-15 percent).  Consequently, over the 34 years between&#13;
1880 and 1913, France had, according to official statistics, between&#13;
11 and 14 years of trade surpluses instead of   1 year.   (H. D.&#13;
White,  The  French  International  Accounts  (1880-1913),  Harvard&#13;
Economic  Studies  No.  40,  Cambridge,  Mass.:    Harvard University&#13;
Press, 1933).   The French  "Direction des Douanes"  (DGD)  (Customs&#13;

Bureau as Information Users&#13;
The second and more likely possibility is that a bureau&#13;
chooses to rely instead on estimates provided directly by the industries&#13;
and persons involved, i.e., the factors of production and consumers. It&#13;
is probable that, for a majority of goods, the amount of information a&#13;
bureau obtains from consumers will be low and/or of poor quality.&#13;
Consumers do not work as a group to estimate their gains and losses. In&#13;
part this is because of the familiar free rider problem: as Olson'/ has&#13;
shown, the probability of an organized consumer group is rather low.&#13;
Another likelihood is that the bureau will ask for information about&#13;
very specific products that represent only a small part of a consumer's&#13;
total expenditures.   As suggested by Downs 2/ it would be unwise for&#13;
individual consumers to react to price changes which are unimportant to&#13;
them.&#13;
1/ (cont.) Agency) never invested the time, money or effort to obtain&#13;
accurate information on the movements of imports/exports, although&#13;
costly fines for undervaluations were promulgated in 1863.   One&#13;
possible explanation is that, since no duties were generally levied&#13;
on exports, only a minimal effort would have been expected from the&#13;
civil  servants.    However,  in  addition,  all  those  years  that&#13;
officially showed trade deficits (in reality trade surpluses) were&#13;
between 1896 and 1909. Announcing the trade deficits was beneficial&#13;
for the DGD, as it emphasized the necessity of greater watchfulness&#13;
over imports, justifying higher budget appropriations for the DGD.&#13;
Indeed, around 1900 the DGD published several reports strongly&#13;
recommending more elaborate trade classifications (see Arnaume, op.&#13;
cit., p. 39).&#13;

The quantity and quality of information will be superior where&#13;
intermediate goods are involved if the group of consumers -- in this&#13;
case, firms -- is small and if the goods involved are an important part&#13;
of the firm's budget.  In addition, better information can be expected&#13;
from consumers if the bureau asks for information on many goods instead&#13;
of  on  specific  products.    An  example would be a basket  of goods&#13;
incorporating the main expenses of consumers, versus a single product.&#13;
This is the situation when a tariff package resulting from a trade round&#13;
such as the Tokyo Round is to be approved.&#13;
The story is quite different where the factors of production&#13;
are  concerned.      Presumably,  organized  groups  such  as  producer&#13;
federations and unions are quite able to estimate fairly easily the&#13;
costs and benefits of changes in protection.&#13;
The interesting problem this situation raises is that the&#13;
"suppliers" of information -- the factors or their representives -- know&#13;
the quality of the information, while the "buyer" -- the bureau -- does&#13;
not.   Obviously, it is very difficult for the bureau to monitor the&#13;
information. This is the typical case of "asymmetrical information." _/&#13;
1/ Further, bureaus with a strong "survival" objective will not&#13;
necessarily try to monitor the information seriously.  As a result,&#13;
they will impose a tariff level much higher than the level implied&#13;
by perfect information, T . An extraordinary counterexample is the&#13;
case of the "Conseil Superieur du Commerce" of 1860, which was in&#13;
charge of determining the new (lower) tariff rates.  It had a very&#13;
peculiar feature in that it was an "ad hoc" transitory committee&#13;
without any survival objective. This council undertook hearings for&#13;
French entrepreneurs but monitored their assertions by holding&#13;
hearings for English entrepreneurs as well (see A. Dunham, The&#13;
Anglo-French Treaty of Commerce of 1860 and the Progress of the&#13;
Industrial Revolution in France, New York: Octagon Books, 1930).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
To illustrate this point, assume that a bureau wants to&#13;
estimate the social costs. This may be easier to achieve for the mobile&#13;
factors, for instance, unskilled labor, than for the factors specific to&#13;
the import-competing industry, where it is far more difficult to&#13;
separate "rents" from returns, to estimate real returns and/or the&#13;
average length of unemployment,  etc.i'   This may lead the bureau to&#13;
accept some overestimations of the costs for labor to offset the&#13;
suspected undervaluation of the costs for the other factors employed by&#13;
the import-competing industry 2/  Obviously, any compromise of this kind&#13;
will distort T' from Te&#13;
As a result of the difficulty in monitoring the information&#13;
produced by the factors of production, a bureau will be induced to&#13;
encourage some competition between the sources of information, or try to&#13;
verify  the  information  provided  (call  on  consulting  firms,  for&#13;
instance).  A variant of the first would be competition between bureaus&#13;
themselves (if they do not agree on the diagnosis of the trade problem)&#13;
or a cross-check using information supplied by other organizations.&#13;
1/ Notice that the estimates made by academics generally include only&#13;
the "labor value cost," which has to be interpreted as the costs for&#13;
the mobile factors.   See,  for example, Magee, op. cit., and M.&#13;
Szenberg, J. W. Lombardi and E. Y. Lee, Welfare Effects of Trade&#13;
Restrictions: A Case Study of the U.S. Footwear Industry, New York:&#13;
Academic Press, 1977.&#13;
2/ Such behavior by bureaus is indeed favorable to the lobbies, since&#13;
it makes it easier to present interest groups as having "social"&#13;
rather than egotistical motives:   capitalists and skilled workers&#13;
seem  to  take  care  of  the  non-skilled  workers'  future.    The&#13;
hypothesis suggested here may explain the oft-alleged "labor-bias"&#13;
of bureaus: this bias would be an indirect way of allowing far less&#13;
for the other (non-labor) factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
However, competition between the sources of information is not&#13;
necessarily possible. Consequently, the second means appears to be the&#13;
most common.&#13;
A frequent device for upgrading information is to license a&#13;
chosen professional association in the industry as the sole source of&#13;
information for the bureau.  This has two familiar characteristics:  a&#13;
monopoly and a long-term contract, so that any false information given&#13;
by the association would get negative returns sooner or later. However,&#13;
some bias is bound to remain, and the possibility of "capture of the&#13;
bureau" by those who benefit from protection increases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Chapter VI&#13;
CONCLUSIONS&#13;
To  summarize,   several  findings  have  emerged  concerning&#13;
protection  by  bureaus.    First,  if  the  bureau  supervising  a  given&#13;
industry is a partial dictator, it will choose a protective level higher&#13;
than the theoretically optimal one.   Second, if, as expected, bureau-&#13;
crats have fewer opportunities than politicians to capture the profits&#13;
(wealth) resulting from protective activities, they will favor higher&#13;
protection. Third, information costs will probably increase a bureau's&#13;
bias toward protection. All these points lead to a basic conclusion --&#13;
any ranking among protective devices which does not fully identify the&#13;
decision-makers who will implement them. 1,&#13;
As  regards  institutions,  the  important  finding  is  that&#13;
administrative structure may have a crucial impact on a bureau's&#13;
inclination  toward  free  trade  or protection.    This  could occur  in&#13;
several ways.  It could change the results of the partial dictatorship&#13;
(Chapter III), modify the conditions of competition between bureaus in&#13;
the area of protective devices (Chapter IV) and, finally, determine the&#13;
information costs and the "property rights" of bureaus and industries&#13;
concerning trade policies (Chapter V).&#13;
The following conclusions follow from these points.   First,&#13;
the broader the scope of a bureau's responsibilities with respect to&#13;
1/ Some empirical evidence seems, at a first glance, to corroborate&#13;
this result.   Deviations  from the trend of trade liberalization&#13;
occurred in France during periods when the bureaus were considered&#13;
to be powerful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

protection, the more likely it is to favor free trade. Examples can be&#13;
seen in the contrast between the EC Commission and national&#13;
bureaucracies or between the West German and state bureaus (although&#13;
this second case appears to have become more ambiguous in the last two&#13;
years).   Second,  information about consumers'  losses resulting frot&#13;
protection can be correctly produced only by institutions which can&#13;
examine the whole range of final goods and which are not limited to some&#13;
category of goods.   This is the only way to overcome the free rider&#13;
problem noticed by Downsl/ and to create a bureaucratic organization&#13;
which  can  be  free  trade-oriented.    The  recent  evolution  of  the&#13;
Australian Industries Assistance Commission,-/ and perhaps, of the U.S.&#13;
International Trade Commission, are interesting examples of such a&#13;
development.   Finally, more effort should be devoted to studying the&#13;
relations between trade policy and administrative structure.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A project to establish the shares of
            industrial country markets held by developing countries,
            changes in such shares in the 1970s, and reasons for
            variations among industry groups and countries aims to
            assist developing and industrial countries improve their
            policies through a better understanding of trade patterns
            and protectionist measures. This paper looks at the role of
            the bureaus (bureaucrats) in the supply of protection in
            France. Three factors appear to influence the bureaus'
            observed tendency toward protection: (i) its position as a
            "partial dictator" with respect to the industry it
            supervises; (ii) inability of a bureau to capture the
            profits that result from protection; and (iii) costs to a
            bureau of information about the impact of protection. The
            study suggests several approaches to negating the
            protectionist tendency of bureaus and states that more
            attention to and study of the relations between trade policy
            and administrative structure are necessary.
