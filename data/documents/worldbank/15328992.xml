                                          FEBRUARY 25, 1948, at 11 zOO A.M.&#13;

&#13;
CHAIRlfAN:           The first item.on the agenda is the approval of the minutes of the l22nd&#13;
(McCloy)&#13;
                     Regular Meeting.       You bave all had copies of the minutes.     Axe there any&#13;
&#13;
                     cOJJlllents?    If not, I declare them approved.    Last week, while I was not&#13;
&#13;
                     here, I believe Mr. Garner put before you a proposed pension plan for the&#13;
&#13;
                     Bank, aOO after some exposition asked that the Directors to think about it&#13;
&#13;
                     and be prepared to discuss it further this week.           I have asked Mr. Parker,&#13;
&#13;
                     'Mr. Riley, Mr. Howell, :Mr. Clark ani Mr. Fowler, who have all worked on the&#13;
&#13;
                     plan, to attend tDday so that they would be prepared to answer any questions&#13;
&#13;
                     or discuss any questions 1fhich come up in connection with the Directors I&#13;
&#13;
                     consideration of it.       I do not believe it is necessary in the light of what&#13;
&#13;
                     transpired last week tD have a further exposition of the Plan at this point.&#13;
&#13;
                     Probably the only thing we can do is to ask for such comments aOO such&#13;
&#13;
                     points, as are in the minds of Directors about it, and then i f a.rry members&#13;
&#13;
                     of the staff wish to make any comments they may.           Is that about right, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                     Parker?        Has anybody any thoughts about it?&#13;
&#13;
SUNDARESAN:          I want to ask a few questions.        How does this scheme compare with the scheme&#13;
&#13;
                     which the United Nations is at present considering?           Also, I have an im-&#13;
&#13;
                     pression that, at any rate in India, the contribution is          61%   by the staff&#13;
&#13;
                     and the total cost is l7i%.        This is approximately the same, an 18% target.&#13;
&#13;
                     I heard last Wednesday that possibly it may not be 18%, but may be a&#13;
&#13;
                     little less.        I want to know how this compares with the scheme Which the&#13;
&#13;
                     U.N. is now considering.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     - 703 -&#13;
&amp;#12;Â·HOifEL1:      As far as the contribution is concerned, it varies a little.            The contri-&#13;
&#13;
               butions under the U.N. scheme are 7% and     14%,    instead of 6% and 12%.     The&#13;
&#13;
               retirement age in our plan is five years higher than        U.l~.,   but in general&#13;
&#13;
               the plan parallels fairly closely the other benefits, with some minor&#13;
&#13;
               differences.   The U.N. scheme at. this time is provisional and. is being&#13;
&#13;
               given quite a caref'ul:; scrutiny by the actuaries.       It will probably be&#13;
&#13;
               subject to some changes.    The actuaries tend to agree that this plan is&#13;
&#13;
               probably a firmer scheme.&#13;
&#13;
SUNDARESAN :   Do I unierstand that our 18% will be better than the U.:t-!. 's       21%?&#13;
HOVt'ELL:      They are not sure that   21% completely covers the benefits provided in the&#13;
               U.N. scheme.   Actuarially over a period it might cost more about 25% or&#13;
&#13;
               27%.&#13;
SUNDARESAN:    Ours?&#13;
&#13;
Hr-'?LL:       Theirs.&#13;
&#13;
SUNDARESAN :   I put these questions because it is going to come up for consideration at&#13;
&#13;
               Lake Success in the next ffIW weeks.   If   11'9   erred on the side of undue&#13;
&#13;
               liberality it would be a basis for U.N. to seek something better than we&#13;
&#13;
               are giving.    Now I am satisfied we are not giving them aDÂ¥ sort of argument&#13;
&#13;
               Â£or improving what they are now proposing.&#13;
&#13;
 CLARK:        There are some other more liberal aspects in the U.N. scheme.            People enter-&#13;
&#13;
               ing over age forty can buy additional years of service.          It is a very ex-&#13;
&#13;
               pensive feature of the plan.    Also they have disability pensions and&#13;
&#13;
               penSions to widows, where our plan calls for lump sums on more or less an&#13;
&#13;
               insurance basis.    Naturally it is more expensive under the U.N. plan.           If&#13;
&#13;
               an employee dies at forty-five, leaving a widow l'rllo is twenty, she would&#13;
&#13;
               get a pension Â£or life under the U.N. plan.          Mr. Buck, the actuary, to-&#13;
&#13;
               gether with a couple of others, one Brazilian ani on Belgian actuary,&#13;
&#13;
               estimated that probably the cost of the U.N. scheme would exceed 25% or&#13;
&#13;
               26% in total, although the original estimate had been 21%.            It is very much&#13;
&amp;#12;'CJ ft tij(:    more expensive than they had contemplated.    Perhaps the benefits will have&#13;
 (      .t'd)&#13;
                to be cut down in the U.N. scheme.&#13;
&#13;
P-ARKER:        I believe the United States is still paying pensions to the 'Widows of the&#13;
&#13;
                War of 1812.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       We want to protect our aged members of the staff from young sirens.&#13;
&#13;
                In general, the aIlB1'ler to the question is that we are cOIlBiderably below&#13;
&#13;
                'What is presumably being talked about at the U.N. today.    I understand,&#13;
&#13;
                howey.er, that according to experts to whom we have submitted our plan that,&#13;
&#13;
                generally speaking, it is on the liberal side as pension plans go generally&#13;
&#13;
                throughout industry.&#13;
&#13;
 FIGGURES:      How far have other international agencies gone in preparing their pension&#13;
&#13;
                schemes?    I ask this as an over-riding consideration.   It does appear that&#13;
&#13;
                it would be desirable i f there were a common pension scheme for everybody&#13;
&#13;
                concerned in the various agencies.     It is not inconceivable that there&#13;
&#13;
                will be a good deal of personnel moving backwards and f6rwards between&#13;
&#13;
                agencies.    Just as in government or industry people can move with advantage,&#13;
&#13;
                it seems to me it will be to the advantage of U.N. that people should move&#13;
&#13;
                around.     '!hat freedom of movement, when a man has to choose giYing up for&#13;
&#13;
                better or worse a pension scheme, is seriously affected.     On our plan,&#13;
                if a man were to leave the Bank with less than five years service, and go&#13;
&#13;
                to the Fund or to the Economic Division of the U.N. he would lose by it.&#13;
                I am not sure that is is wise for us to establish something which would&#13;
&#13;
                make it difficult for a man to make a move.     If other agencies have not&#13;
&#13;
                gone too far, cannot we get a unified scheme for a group of them?&#13;
&#13;
 PARKER:        Our difficulty in coming to a precise agreement with the International&#13;
&#13;
                Monetary Fund, our sister organization, in the same building, is indicative&#13;
&#13;
                of what would happen if we attempted to put all the agencies together.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             I feel that i f the'Bank is ready to' meve Shead and assume leadership&#13;
&#13;
             in this matter, after fifteen menths ef study, it may very well be that&#13;
&#13;
             the balance ef plans will look like eurs when the sheeting is all ever.&#13;
&#13;
             I feel if we make such an attempt that it might pestpene the successful&#13;
&#13;
             adeptien ef the plan almost indefinitely.&#13;
&#13;
PARKINSON:   What are the prespects, since we have eur plan ready, ef at least getting&#13;
&#13;
             the Fund in with us?&#13;
&#13;
PARKER:      I can enly surmise, sir.      When this plan was shown to' Mr. Gutt, he said,&#13;
&#13;
             this is the best plan I bave seen.      The reply was !lBut Mr. Gutt, yeu have&#13;
&#13;
             not leeked at this plan".      He answered, "It is in writing and. being, which&#13;
&#13;
             is better than ether plans".      I have censulted my friends in the Fund, and&#13;
&#13;
             they are enthusiastic about eur actien in meving ahead en the thing, and&#13;
&#13;
             eur peints ef difference I think can be recenciled.      I think it is very&#13;
&#13;
             likely that the Fund will come through 1-'&lt;'1 th something identical with eur&#13;
&#13;
             plan er so. clese to' it that the peints ef difference will be ef no. moment.&#13;
&#13;
             We de net recommend it, however.      We recemmend that we centinue with a&#13;
&#13;
             separate administration.&#13;
&#13;
PARKINSON:   It YÂ«&gt;uld be a great advantage am a great example if the two' erganizatiens&#13;
&#13;
             could be to gather on it.&#13;
&#13;
PARKER:      I talked to' the Fund and I de net know ef an;ything in eur plan that the&#13;
&#13;
             Fund cannot see their    w~   clear to' adept if the larger measure was attain-&#13;
&#13;
             ing unifermity.    There are three main peints ef difference.     One is the&#13;
&#13;
             60/65   age previsien.   In talking this morning, some ef them theught this&#13;
&#13;
             was net a serious matter, and less serieus than it was last week.       The&#13;
&#13;
             ether peint is the pensien fer widows am erphans, and that they will find&#13;
&#13;
             so. expensive that they will prebably have to' adept eur view.     The third&#13;
&#13;
             questien cO.ncerns a Provident Fund which is so. expensive that prebably they&#13;
&#13;
             will have t'O. adept eur view.&#13;
&amp;#12;r   EliOT:   It seems to me on the whole this pension plan does not call for special&#13;
&#13;
             comment.   It is a good plan, ani on the whole   ge~rous.   But. it does not&#13;
&#13;
             provide, it seems to me, sufficiently for relatives of the staff as dis-&#13;
&#13;
             cussed a moment ago.    I think there is more and more a tendency in all&#13;
&#13;
             pension plans in this country and in man;r other parts of the world to&#13;
&#13;
             provide largely for widows and children.    For instance it has been the&#13;
&#13;
             general rule for maI'.\Y years in France to have a pension for a widow and&#13;
&#13;
             to include provision of a deceased husbard's pension for his widow and&#13;
&#13;
             provision for children too.    Now I would like the staff to tell us if&#13;
&#13;
             the provision about something being given to the estate of the deceased&#13;
&#13;
             member, his contributions, ani such, and such an amount calculated on&#13;
&#13;
             salary or pension will meet some part of what I think should be done for&#13;
&#13;
             widows or orphans.     There should be some provision in the plan.   I must&#13;
&#13;
             say that i f I thus stress widows and orphans, in some other ways the plan&#13;
&#13;
             is designed more generouslY for people who live.     Provision is made for&#13;
&#13;
             a pension of a minimum of $50 a year for every year.     If a man has been&#13;
&#13;
             forty years in the Bank, that makes $2,000.      In some cases that may be&#13;
&#13;
             as much as his salary, or nearly his maximum salary, if I have reference&#13;
&#13;
             to   the scale of salaries that was in effect in 1946.    In many cases it&#13;
&#13;
             will reach two-thirds of the highest salary of his working period.      You&#13;
&#13;
             know two-thirds of the maximum salary very often makes a general average&#13;
&#13;
             of your whole earned salary.     It seems to me that on this side of the&#13;
&#13;
             pro blem your plan is generous, but on the side of widows am orphans, not&#13;
&#13;
             very generous.    The second. thing I would like to stress is that in my mind&#13;
&#13;
             a pension plan is a retirement plan.     ;'Vhen you make a penSion plan general-&#13;
&#13;
             ly at the same time you tell people what they may expect in the way of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         - 707 -&#13;
&amp;#12;H(''''"r)"ENOT:   retirement.      It is another side of the problem.       A pension is not supposed&#13;
(l .tld)&#13;
                  to be only in the interest of the people who get the pension.                It is of&#13;
&#13;
                  major importance for the smooth       ~mjnjstrati ve    running of a large concern&#13;
&#13;
                  such as the Bank.      I~   is best, when you make a pension plan, to make certain&#13;
&#13;
                  provisions for compulsory retirement so that the whole personnel knows where&#13;
&#13;
                  it stands.    As to other benefits such a plan usually provides for the regular&#13;
&#13;
                  promotiol'! of younger men on the staff ani may help in the             al~-over    sound&#13;
&#13;
                  sense of competition and work among officers.           I would look to members of&#13;
&#13;
                  the staff to express their ideas about the second point.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:         The second point being that the plan is not clear enough as to the com-&#13;
&#13;
                  pulsory retirement feature.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENOT:         Yes.   The first provision is that normal retirement will be age              65.    Normai&#13;
&#13;
                  is not compulsory.&#13;
&#13;
Cl     .&amp;AN:      As I unierstand it, it is intenied to be compulsory.&#13;
HOPPENOT:         Sixty-five is all right, but What of retirement before             65.&#13;
PARKER:           I think the language on the condition for retirement, is poor language as&#13;
&#13;
                  set out here.      It should be a c ondi ti on for being pensioned.         Our retire-&#13;
&#13;
                  ment plan and simjJar matters are covered in our termination policy, which&#13;
&#13;
                  is a separate policy from the pension plan.            I think Mr. Clark can deal&#13;
&#13;
                  with Mr. Hoppenotls two main questions.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:         Before we get to that, I want to clear up the business of retirement in&#13;
&#13;
                  nv own   mind.    I understand that the retirement age under this plan aIJi under&#13;
&#13;
                  our termination plan is       65.   If we want to keep someone on after that,&#13;
&#13;
                  by whose action will it be?         The Board?    The President.     An employee can&#13;
&#13;
                  continue on from year to year until age 70.            At the age of 70 he goes&#13;
&#13;
                  absolutely.      The normal provision, however, will be that only in extra-&#13;
&#13;
                  ordinary cases will anyone over        65   be kept.   Now if at   60    we have somebody&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 708 -&#13;
&amp;#12;            that we do, not think is pulling his weight, or for one reason or another&#13;
&#13;
            it is desirable to discontinue his services, we would ask him to wi. thdraw&#13;
&#13;
            from the Bank.    At that point he could, if I am correct, either defer his&#13;
&#13;
            pension rights until he reaches age 65, or draw down a lesser sum at age&#13;
&#13;
            60, depending upon what has accrued to. him up to age 60.     Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
            Now there is nothing, as I see it, in    th~   Pension Plan itself that would&#13;
&#13;
            preclude our making a special arrangement for anybody whose services we~e&#13;
&#13;
            terminated at any time during the course of his service.      I mean that a&#13;
&#13;
            man may for one reason or another have a particularly difficult situation&#13;
&#13;
            to adjust in connection "With terminating seryice and the Bank might feel&#13;
&#13;
            it would wish to make a particular adjustment in a particular casÂ·e.     That&#13;
&#13;
            would be entirely in order am purely a matter of termination.        Such adjust-&#13;
&#13;
            ment   ~uld   not be paid from the pension fund.    Does that clear up your&#13;
&#13;
            second point?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENOTI   My second point is, Mr. Chairman, that I would prefer, in the interest of&#13;
&#13;
            the staff, that both things should be made clear at the same time.       At the&#13;
&#13;
            same time as you tell people "You get a pension", you tell them also,&#13;
&#13;
            "These are the time, age and conditions when you have to retire".       They&#13;
&#13;
            are two parts of the pension plan as I see them.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   In other words, you think we ought to spell out more clearly a statement&#13;
&#13;
            about retirement.&#13;
&#13;
PARKER:     That is contemplated, sir.    We are going to clarify the language.    Actually&#13;
&#13;
            we have condensed the plan very much, and the condensation is such that&#13;
&#13;
            it is not very clear.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   It has been proposed in connection with the exploration of the plan to&#13;
&#13;
            state that the retirement age will normally be 65.       The summary as proposed&#13;
&#13;
            seems too brief, but in presenting it to the staff, we can make it clear&#13;
&#13;
            and we can also explain the other provisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          - 109 -&#13;
&amp;#12;PA P""ER :   If a man joins the staff of the Bank at the age of 25, he has potentially&#13;
&#13;
             40 years of service, and his max:i.m:um potential pension Ylould be 4o/6cPths&#13;
             of his salary.    When he reaches 60, he has 35' fortieth's of his potential&#13;
&#13;
             pension.    He has around seven eighths and could serve long enough to have&#13;
&#13;
             one more.   There would be the right to have the smaller pension begin&#13;
&#13;
             earlier and that I think is more or less equitable.      So at the age of 60,&#13;
&#13;
             he could get 35 fortieths of what the potential pension is.&#13;
&#13;
RILEY:       However, if he retires balore the retirement age, he gets somewhat less&#13;
&#13;
             than 35/40, or the proportion of what the full pension would be at the&#13;
&#13;
             age of 65; less because of interest loss and a longer period of payment.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    Yes, I get that.&#13;
&#13;
PARKER:      Does that answer Mr. Hoppenot 1 s question?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN;    That answers the second question.       Now you want some one to speak on the&#13;
&#13;
             matter of greater generosity for widows and orphans and the fact that we&#13;
&#13;
             are too eenerous to the living.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENar:    I meant that I should hate to choose to whom to be generous and I do not&#13;
&#13;
             object to any generosity to the living.&#13;
&#13;
CLARK:       On the first question, this is primarily a pension plan, and the main&#13;
&#13;
             purpose of the plan is a pension plan for retirement of employees.       It&#13;
&#13;
             is true that provisions for widows and orphans have become in recent years&#13;
&#13;
             somewhat more generous than in the past in pension plans generally.       How-&#13;
             ever, it is a    ve~   expensive feature of a plan, and was one of the very&#13;
&#13;
             expensive features of the plan as we originally had it, copying it from U.N.&#13;
&#13;
             We found the cost too high.     That was one of the reasons for providing&#13;
&#13;
             the insurance feature.      It seemed possible in the light of plans generally,&#13;
&#13;
             and was still more generous than most of them.       If a person works for the&#13;
&#13;
             Bank for two years, he gets his contributions on his death, or rather,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           - 710 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CLARK:      his widow ani children would get his contributions, plus interest, p1uB&#13;
(c  ,'d)&#13;
            twice the annual rate of salary earned at the time he died.      There will be&#13;
&#13;
            provisions, similar to insurance policy options, so tnat either party, the&#13;
&#13;
            beneficiary or the employee, could elect to have pa;yment in the form of an&#13;
&#13;
            annuity over a period of years on an assured basis, not on the basis of&#13;
&#13;
            life insurance, but on the basis of so much per year for each of so many&#13;
&#13;
            years.    I think you will find that in comparison with most pension plans,&#13;
&#13;
            though not U.N.'s as it stands at the moment, this is exceedingly generous&#13;
&#13;
            to widows and orphans.    On the preceding point, in order to allow adequate&#13;
&#13;
            pensions to people who have worked in the Bank, we provided tba $50 minimum&#13;
&#13;
            per year of service.     In a normal case after 30 years of service the pension&#13;
&#13;
            would be 50% of salary or thU"ty-sixtieths; 30 years of service at 30 times&#13;
&#13;
            SO   would give 1500.   Thus only in the case of $3000 or les5 would the minimum.&#13;
&#13;
            apply, ani the $1500 a year could under no circumstances be considered lavish&#13;
&#13;
            nor undue generosity for an employee with that service.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENOT:   I did not say so, Mr. Clark.     I simply stressed that i f you have a certain&#13;
&#13;
            scale that goes from $1,100 a year to $2,000 another year, it may be, I&#13;
&#13;
            do not say it will be in general, but it may be that the 50     t~mes   40 which&#13;
&#13;
            makes the $2,000 would for some people in extreme cases mean a pension as&#13;
&#13;
            high as their salary or may be    hi~er.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CLARK:      It is a mathematical impossibility i f he is earning, as would be generally&#13;
&#13;
            true, more than $2,000.     He could not exceed his salary except in the case&#13;
&#13;
            of an employee earning less than $2,000 a year.      I f you get someone at a&#13;
&#13;
            low salary, it is possible.     That ,however, is not the real basis.    If he&#13;
&#13;
            is earning a salary of $1200 to $1800 a year, he still needs that much to&#13;
&#13;
            live on whether working or retired.      ffuat we wanted to do was provide a&#13;
&#13;
            subsistence level for retired employees, and it was at that point that 650&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           - 711 -&#13;
&amp;#12;. CLARK:           for each year of service was fixed as the minimum even for a person who&#13;
  (   t'd)&#13;
                   worked for less than $2,000 a year, am might have been earning only- $1800.&#13;
&#13;
                   On the other ham, a person working for $1800 to $2000 a y-ear is not going to&#13;
&#13;
                   get rich out of the pension fund, and it seelOOd to us better to provide&#13;
&#13;
                   adequately- for the lower bracket people.&#13;
&#13;
FIGGURES:          ~    I make a remark'on that?    Either a man is earning at retirement more than&#13;
&#13;
                   he needs, or the Bank is pay-ing him less.    In the case of the one man, surely-&#13;
&#13;
                   it is wrong that any pension scheIllE'! should provide a pension higher than his&#13;
&#13;
                   pay-, am the point Mr. Hoppenot is making could be covered by a provision&#13;
&#13;
                   that in no case should the pension be higher than the salary earned.&#13;
&#13;
CLARK:             Vie were thinking that there would be very few people who y{Ould work   40&#13;
                   years for the Bank am end up earning less than $2,000 per year.      Although&#13;
&#13;
                   it is a mathematical pOSSibility-, it is not a practical one.&#13;
&#13;
 P'- '"ER:         Vie will put the provision in.&#13;
&#13;
 SUNDARESAN :      What would be the position about income tax'l    At the moment, salaries are&#13;
&#13;
                   exempt from taxation.   What about pension payments?    Will they be tax free?&#13;
&#13;
 PARKER:           No, sir.&#13;
&#13;
 RILEY:            It will depend on what particular type of case you consider.     The only&#13;
&#13;
                   obligation here is to make the payments and if there is legislation for&#13;
&#13;
                   exemption from taxes, to handle it then.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIRMANz         It is hard to generalize.   You can give information as to whether they- would&#13;
&#13;
                   be exempt or whether they- muld not be under particular circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
                   There is the view that if y-ou draw back y-our own capital, it is not taxable,&#13;
&#13;
                   but when you draw bey-onei, it is taxable.   From time to time of course there&#13;
&#13;
                   are provisions in the U.S. tax laws for exemption of pensions as such and&#13;
&#13;
                   not in excess of a certain amount.&#13;
&#13;
 S,   ...ARESAN:   l~   point is that, if you are going to have a pension, it should be net.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 712 -&#13;
&amp;#12;C    RMAN:        We could not take that.&#13;
&#13;
SUNDA.RE.'5AN :   You should then make it plain that the Pension Fund allows for taxes as a&#13;
&#13;
                  liability_   Otherwise, we shall be making a scheme with unreal benefits.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:         I think it is just as well.    In fact we are benefitting by our salaries&#13;
&#13;
                  being income tax: free, so that we ought to negative the thought that the&#13;
&#13;
                  pensions are income tax free as far as the Bank is concerned.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:         I have one question for Mr. Parker regarding the possibility of the liquid-&#13;
&#13;
                  ation of the Bank or the permanent suspension of the Pension Fund.             Is it&#13;
&#13;
                  taken into consideration in computing the amounts of the contributions of&#13;
&#13;
                  the personnel of the Bank that this may happen.       ThisÂ· 8i tuation is con-&#13;
&#13;
                  templated in the Articles of Agreement and we must face it.        In the matter&#13;
&#13;
                  of the liquidation of the Bank, are the accrued rights of the personnel&#13;
&#13;
                  meant to be wholly covered by the amounts spent in the fund, ani deferred&#13;
&#13;
                  until the old age of the employee.     I am wondering whether this has been&#13;
&#13;
                  contemplated at all, or i f not, whether these potential benefits should not&#13;
&#13;
                  be taken into consideration.&#13;
&#13;
CLARK:            The question of what would happen in the case of existing benefits at the&#13;
&#13;
                  time that the plan might be liquidated is not covered.       It has been dis-&#13;
&#13;
                  cussed, and it has been hoped that should this happen the actual cost will&#13;
&#13;
                  be approximately 18% of the employee's earnings and that then will be the&#13;
&#13;
                  cost to get it running on a sound basis.       We were hoping there would not&#13;
&#13;
                  be a deficit of a figure on a very substantial basis.       In the summary, the&#13;
&#13;
                  18% or approximately 18% should be stated perhaps somewhat differently-.&#13;
&#13;
                  It should state that 6% will be paid by the employee and the remainder by&#13;
&#13;
                  the Bank.    Does t..'1at take care of your question, Mr. Baranski'i&#13;
&#13;
F    lURES:       May I ask one more question?     If a man, at the request of the Bank was&#13;
&#13;
                  retained in service after the age of     65,   and had already done    40    years,&#13;
&#13;
                  would he be able to earn further rights, or is he cut off at          65'1&#13;
&amp;#12;                 That is not covered.&#13;
&#13;
PARKER:          How does the Board feel?    Should he earn more rights?&#13;
&#13;
SONDARESAN :     I think we ought to set a limit.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        65.&#13;
FIGGURES:        I think we could fairly say that i f a staff member at    65   has earned less&#13;
&#13;
                 than a two-thirds pension, service after   65   should be counted Wltil he&#13;
&#13;
                 has.    I think two-thirds is the right anount.    He ought not tto be able to&#13;
&#13;
                 earn more than that.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        I think that as soon as possible we had better incorporate that.        Are you&#13;
                 satisfied?&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:        For the moment yes, but I would like to propose that the pension fund "VIOuld&#13;
&#13;
                 not be distributed but would rather be maintained as a fund :(or the staff,&#13;
&#13;
                 but mainly it was a question of querying whether it was contemplated what&#13;
&#13;
                 would happen if the Bank liquidated, which is rather an important question.&#13;
&#13;
VARVAIlESSOS :   Mr. Chairman, with regard to the general principles of the Plan, I must say&#13;
&#13;
                 that it is the usual custom in Europe for all pension plans to provide also&#13;
&#13;
                 f or widows and orphans in public service, in service in public institutions,&#13;
&#13;
                 Central Banks, and so on.    That is right.     There is not doubt about it.      It&#13;
&#13;
                 is considered as rather generous and we must accept the fact that we have&#13;
&#13;
                 to deal with a very young organization and we ought to be directing a pension&#13;
&#13;
                 fund for the staff so that staff receives what is really fair or more than&#13;
&#13;
                 fair.    There are other possibilities for anyone to secure his fanily, widow&#13;
&#13;
                 and children.    The Bank pays, am I hope ldil continue to pay, a salary&#13;
&#13;
                 which is considered just, not just necessary to cover the needs of the&#13;
&#13;
                 family, but which leaves some margin.    So although I should welcome it, our&#13;
&#13;
                 Bank should provide although to a lesser degree, for widows and orphans.&#13;
&#13;
                 On the other hand, there is no limit of service here, and with a pension&#13;
&#13;
                 fund there are normally two limits, two pre-requisites; one is age, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 714 -&#13;
&amp;#12;               other is the number of years of service.      If a man is engaged in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
               at   58   or 60, and he has only ten years' servi ce, he is entitled to a pro-&#13;
&#13;
               portional pension as I u..nderstand it.    There is no limit,   SO   we have gone&#13;
&#13;
               much further than the usual pension funds.      The second point I should like&#13;
&#13;
               to make is that it is really desirable where you have an identical organ-&#13;
&#13;
               ization such as the Fund to have the sama plan.      On the other hand I think&#13;
&#13;
               that scmeone must take the initiative and someone must set the example.&#13;
&#13;
               Otherwise, i f we continue to discuss it with one or more specialized&#13;
&#13;
               agencies, we may defer the thing for months and years.      I should however,&#13;
&#13;
               propose that,as this is a plan which contains the general provisions.          I&#13;
&#13;
               have accepted that as the general basis of what will be developed When the&#13;
&#13;
               plan takes a definite form.      I should propose that the Board accept the&#13;
&#13;
               proposals contained in this plan but that we shall not be held to applying&#13;
&#13;
               them. There is the importance of making an agreement with the Fund.          Then&#13;
&#13;
               we can discuss a:r:cr changes which might facilitate agreement.       I think we&#13;
&#13;
               shall then give the impression that we are going forward without any&#13;
&#13;
               hindrance or delay from a:r:crone.   On the other hand, we must do something&#13;
&#13;
               even i f we cannot in the end reach full    agreem~t.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FI C,oURES :   Could I add a rider to that?      Returning to the point we raised initially,&#13;
&#13;
               I am sure we would all agree that we ought not to let years slip by nor&#13;
&#13;
               even six or eight months before we act.       I completely agree that it is&#13;
&#13;
               most desirable we should go ahead.       We have produced a plan and written&#13;
&#13;
               it out.      I would like to suggest that we ask you sir, to discuss with the&#13;
&#13;
               Fund the possibility of getting a plan which agrees in its details with&#13;
&#13;
               them, and say that we are very anxious on this Board to get the pension&#13;
&#13;
               plan in operation quickly and not prolong it for months and months, but&#13;
&#13;
               that we are prepared to delay a little longer if we could get an agreement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 715 -&#13;
&amp;#12;F~   URES:     vn th   them, and see i f we can do that in the space of about three or four&#13;
(c..vdt 'd)&#13;
               weeks.&#13;
&#13;
               I would like to return to the U.N. suggestion.     I appreciate this may be&#13;
&#13;
               very difficult, but the U.N. has a pension plan, and I should think that&#13;
&#13;
               the U.N. also will not be able to postpone it indefinitely.      If the U.N.&#13;
&#13;
               is able to    int~duce   a more generous plan than we could accept, that is&#13;
&#13;
               a pity.     I would like to suggest that you make some exploration with them&#13;
&#13;
               and let us know in three or four weeks' time mether there is any chance&#13;
&#13;
               of getting down to an agreement with them on the plan, obviously making&#13;
&#13;
               some concessions if necessary, so we can have similar plans.      It is&#13;
&#13;
               desirable to have a penSion plan identical    bet~en   the Bank and Fund and&#13;
&#13;
               secondly a pension plan identical with U.N. and other agencies prepared&#13;
&#13;
               to come along.     It would be a great advantage if we can make the transfer&#13;
&#13;
               of personnel from one organization to another easy and simple.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:      What is the sense of the Bca rd on the suggestion of Mr. FiggU.res?&#13;
&#13;
PARKINSON:     I should like to support Yr. Figgures I suggestion whole heartedly.       I think&#13;
&#13;
               we should make it clear that we have a plan which we do not intend to&#13;
&#13;
               modify substantially, but that we are anxious to get reasonable uniformity&#13;
&#13;
               of' treatment unier it, and we are prepared to discuss minor changes if&#13;
&#13;
               we can reach agreement in a short time.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:   This is really desirable.      I should like to ask Mr. Parker how long was&#13;
&#13;
               the discussion with the Monetary Fund?&#13;
&#13;
PARKER:        Fifteen months.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:   That is one organization only, working l.1I'der similar conditions to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
               U.N. has other sources, direct contributions of the member governments to&#13;
&#13;
               the expenses.     We have our capital, and I do not think we shall be able to&#13;
&#13;
               follow.     I repeat it would be desirable, not for this purpose of moving&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
V    lRESSOS:   personnel, because I do not think it is in our interest to encourage this&#13;
(Lvtlt1d)&#13;
                movement of personnel from one organization to another.      This is a bank&#13;
&#13;
                and we had better have a separate. personnel rather than a moving one.      How-&#13;
&#13;
                ever, for the appearance and for the fact that we Shall prove that there is&#13;
&#13;
                a general conception of theÂ· attitude of international organizations towards&#13;
&#13;
                their staff, it is deSirable, but I am afraid that we shall discuss the&#13;
&#13;
                thing really for years witQ the U.N.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       I must confess that if this thing were put in the form of     ho~ding   it up&#13;
&#13;
                until we could reach agreement we could table the "Whole thing now, even as&#13;
&#13;
                to the Fund.   I think there is something to be said for another gesture on&#13;
&#13;
                our part, particularly in re"spect of the Fund after this Board has considered&#13;
&#13;
                it.   Up to date it has been only the staff.      If this Board can authorize me&#13;
&#13;
                to say that this plan is agreed to in principle am to convey that thought&#13;
&#13;
                to the Fund, with the idea that we are prepared to alter it in relatively&#13;
                minor details for the sake of having uniformity with the other Bretton Woods&#13;
&#13;
                organization, but that we contemplate coming to a close on this thing with-&#13;
&#13;
                in a period of two to three weeks, it is feasible.       I think at the same&#13;
&#13;
                time I can notify the U.N. people that we had made the study; but I would&#13;
&#13;
                despair, really despair, of arriving at any agreement with them or their&#13;
&#13;
                agencies within   a~   such period as that.&#13;
&#13;
FIGGURES:       I feel, Mr. Chairman, that you are perfectly right on the U.N. front, but&#13;
&#13;
                I feel We ought to make a gesture, even if it is not mrs than a gesture.&#13;
&#13;
                There are of course methods of putting on pressure.       The gesture, if follaw-&#13;
&#13;
                ed up by putting pressure on them to accept, might produce results.&#13;
&#13;
HOWELL:         I think perhaps we did not make one point dear.        The U.N. now has a plan.&#13;
&#13;
                It was adopted by the General Assembly a year ago last September.        There&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 717 .,.&#13;
&amp;#12;HOWELL:       were certain actuarial proposals made.      They voted to leave it on a&#13;
(C  i'd)&#13;
              provisional basis until next September, at which time they would take&#13;
&#13;
              further action.    So they have a plan, but it is provisional.        Probably&#13;
&#13;
              no change will be made until some time at least after September and probably&#13;
&#13;
              beyond that.     I think U.N. itself recognized, from what Mr. Demuth and I&#13;
&#13;
              have gathered there, that it would be quite difficult, considering the&#13;
&#13;
              provisional basis, tA::&gt; get agencies to come intA::&gt; it.    I.L.O.have looked at&#13;
&#13;
              it.   They decided not to do it at the present time.         The same applies to&#13;
&#13;
              F.A.O.     F.A.O. is not going intA::&gt; the U.N. scheme because of the provision-&#13;
&#13;
              al nature of scheme.     It is recognized that it may take some time to get&#13;
&#13;
              out of that stage.     I do not think we made that clear.&#13;
&#13;
SUNDARESAN:   My own impression is that F .A.O. at the last meeting took the view in the&#13;
&#13;
              Financial Control Committee, that it may not be      ql   ite suitable to join the&#13;
&#13;
              U.N. scheme.      They felt it was going to be more expensive.       It is still&#13;
&#13;
              UIIier review.    I agree it will take a year before any kind of finality is&#13;
&#13;
              reached.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRM.AlI:   I will proceed along that line, if it is agreeable to everybody.          In general&#13;
&#13;
              I think we should be liberal, but not too liberal, so to speak, in this&#13;
&#13;
              si tuation.    Our salaries, generally speaking, are on the liberal side com-&#13;
&#13;
              pared certainly to the goverrunent salaries of equal rank in the U.S., in&#13;
&#13;
              the city of Washington, and elsevmere, so far as I know.          In addition, we&#13;
&#13;
              have this tax exemption feature, which causes everybody to look at us a&#13;
&#13;
              little aska:oce, that is, all those who pay taxes.          I am quite sure that&#13;
&#13;
              with the tax exemption, generally speaking, our salary levels are pretty&#13;
&#13;
              high, so that there ought to be, at least compared with others, an opportu-&#13;
&#13;
              nity for the staff to save some money.       If you add what we are told by those&#13;
&#13;
              who have looked at this objectively, quite apart from comparisons with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 718 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CF ' ~11MAl1 :   Fund or U.N., our liberal pension provisions.       To increase further the&#13;
(c.. ,Cold)&#13;
                 emoluments may subject us to same criticism and particularly to increase&#13;
&#13;
                 benefits along the line of what you call the Provident Fund.           It is really&#13;
&#13;
                 another way of increasing the salaries of the members.         It would be something.&#13;
&#13;
                 that would be impracticable for us to adopt considering our position.          Those&#13;
&#13;
                 considerations I think we would bring to bear in talking with the Fund.            I&#13;
&#13;
                 would hope that we could ccme to an agreement with the Fund.           I think it is&#13;
&#13;
                 highly desirable.    Suppose I put it on the basis that if we carmot do any-&#13;
&#13;
                 thing in three weeks we reserve the right to go forward with action on this&#13;
&#13;
                 plan.;   Is that all right?&#13;
&#13;
PAP.KINSON:      Three weeks seems short, am rather arbitrary.&#13;
&#13;
PARKER:          We cannot do this very well with the Fund.       The whole thing has been under&#13;
&#13;
                 consideration for fifteen months.        I think we must   noti~   them of the action&#13;
&#13;
                 taken here.    The best way to reach a unifonn plan would be to approve the&#13;
&#13;
                 plan in principle and instruct us to work with the Fund and give us instruct-&#13;
&#13;
                 ions to draft the thing in precise form and present it in that precise form&#13;
&#13;
                 as soon as we can.    That would be in three or four weeks.' Our Fund friends&#13;
&#13;
                 lmow it takes that time and they do have time to join us if they want to.&#13;
&#13;
                 We can be a little flexible and of course would be.         We have always been.&#13;
&#13;
                 That would be satisfactory for us.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        Well, as. so interpreted is that action suitable to the Board?&#13;
&#13;
FIGGURES:        I would like to add, I assume agreement in principle does not preclude us&#13;
&#13;
                 from raiSing points when the final draft comes to us.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        Well, that disposes of that.&#13;
&#13;
                 The next item is the report ofÂ· the Ad Hoc Committee on the Tenth Member&#13;
&#13;
                 of the Advisory Council.      Would you report on that, Mr. Sundaresan?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 719 -&#13;
&amp;#12;Sl   IRESAN:   There is nothing more for me to say than what has already been stated in&#13;
&#13;
               the report circulated to the Board.        It is my present intenti.on, i f the&#13;
&#13;
               Board approves of the recommendation made in the report, to meet this&#13;
&#13;
               gentleman, Mr. Kalecki, in New York, where I hope to be this week-end and&#13;
&#13;
               sound him out before we make an official approach.        I will talk to the&#13;
&#13;
               Board next Wednesday so we can take formal action.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAll:     The only thing before us today would be formal approval of the report.                Is&#13;
&#13;
               there any discussion?    If not, I will declare it approved.       }ofe   will hear&#13;
&#13;
               further from you whether he is eligible and then prepare a formal report&#13;
&#13;
               to the Board of Governors.&#13;
&#13;
PARKINSON:     It occurred to me that Mr. Kalecki is an official of the U.N.             Is there&#13;
&#13;
               anything improper in appointing to the Advisory Council a man who,             so&#13;
&#13;
               to speak, acts at the dictate of the Economic Section of the U.N., am. so&#13;
&#13;
               to speak, has a policy or may find himself with a policy from time to time&#13;
&#13;
               on larger issues with which the Bank is concerned.&#13;
&#13;
MEYER:         I raised that question and I think Mr. SUndaresan said he was not connected&#13;
&#13;
               permanently with U.N.    He is some sort of adviser.&#13;
&#13;
SUNDARESAN :   They gave him a kind of status.      When I meet him this week-end' I shall be&#13;
&#13;
               able to find out a little more and judge to what extent he would be avail-&#13;
&#13;
               able for the Council.    After I meet him I shall be able to report.&#13;
&#13;
FIGGURESI      Would not it be wiser to talk to :tAr. Owen before he is approached?            Surely&#13;
&#13;
               Mr. Owen ought to know mether he approved this appointment.               I am suggest-&#13;
&#13;
               ing that the ma.tter   ou~t   to be discussed with Mr. OWen.     He is apparently&#13;
&#13;
               his subordinate.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOO:   I think we nrust."keep in mind that we have to do here with members of an&#13;
&#13;
               advisory council, people who are invited here once a year to give their&#13;
&#13;
               advice.   I am quite sure that all these people will have other connections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 720 -&#13;
&amp;#12;Vft~VARESSOS   :   We carmot say a connection with U.N. will be a disadvantage.      Any connect-&#13;
(   ,t' d)&#13;
                   ion with a university, or with official service, might be more of a dis-&#13;
&#13;
                   advantage.    I do not think there is any difficulty legally.    Substantially&#13;
&#13;
                   I think there is nothing 1'Vhich will prevent us from asking for the opinion&#13;
&#13;
                   of one of the members of U.N.&#13;
&#13;
PARKINSON:         I happen to have met him.    I think he wrote the last Economic Survey of&#13;
&#13;
                   the U.N., which struck the headlines a few weeks ago.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARES50S :      So much the better if he comes here am expounds his views.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:          I have the feeling that we are not going into the U.N. to take one of their&#13;
&#13;
                   members.     I think we are picking out an individual.   We did not consult with&#13;
&#13;
                   any of the employers of any of the other individuals When we approached them.&#13;
&#13;
FIGGURES:          I would not suggest a formal approach.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:          I think perhaps we might say to Owen that we are bringing him on, but I&#13;
&#13;
                   think we have to enphasize that we are selecting individuals with widely&#13;
&#13;
                   different attitudes and views.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

rtH.AIRYAN :   I think we have to emphasise that we are selecting caOOidates with&#13;
  .iont1d)&#13;
               widely different attitudes in order to guide us within certain limits.&#13;
&#13;
               The wider the representation of views and the stronger they are, the&#13;
&#13;
               better.    Well, we will see when you have been there.&#13;
&#13;
SUNDARESAN     you can leave it to me.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN :     I would not recognize that there is an,v formal inconsistency in our asking&#13;
&#13;
               for a person who is a member of the U.N. to serve on the Advisory council,&#13;
&#13;
               even if he were in a closer position to that or another organization.&#13;
&#13;
               The d ate of the next meeting is next wednesday.&#13;
&#13;
               I will ask   Mr. Iliff   to report to you on the status of the loans that&#13;
               are current at the moment.&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF          There are a number of 'points arising out of the activities of the Loan&#13;
&#13;
               Department, which I think you would wish me to bring to the notice of the&#13;
&#13;
               Board.    In doing so, and seeing that this is my first appearance before&#13;
&#13;
               the Board, I would ask your. indulgence, especially in the matter of cross-&#13;
&#13;
               examination.    I am still "'geI-y much in the kindergarten stage, ani I have&#13;
&#13;
               not been able to infonn myself as well as I should wish, of      ~he   very&#13;
&#13;
               complicated and difficult questions that the Loan Department is called&#13;
&#13;
               on to deal wi th, so with that warning I shall do my best.&#13;
&#13;
               I would first like to mention the question of the DUtch loan.          When the&#13;
&#13;
               original negotiations were carried out, we agreed with the Dutch&#13;
&#13;
               Government that the   closi~g    date for the loan should be March 31, 1946.&#13;
&#13;
               The Dutch Government mentioned at the time that it might not be possible&#13;
&#13;
               for them to draw down and fully utilize the whole of their loan by that&#13;
&#13;
               date, and that they might wish to ask for an extension.        The Bank at&#13;
&#13;
               the time indicated that in principle it would have no objection to&#13;
&#13;
               that.     That situation has now arisen, and the Dutch Government approached&#13;
&amp;#12;                              -        2   -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
us with the request to extend the closing date to JUne 30.                    we have agreed to&#13;
do   so" but one question has arisen about which we had some difficulty in coming&#13;
to a conclusion.    After the main DUtch negotiations had been concluded, the&#13;
Bank adopted a new policy with regard to interest, and it was decided that this&#13;
&#13;
:new policy should apply to all new borrowers.                The   ~licy   is roughly that during&#13;
the first six months of a loan" a l!% commitment fee should be charged on any&#13;
undisbursed portion, and at the eni of six months, interest should become full,&#13;
whether the loan is disbursed or not.               We have felt that it would notbe fair&#13;
to apply the new policy to the Dutch request for extension.                    We put in a note&#13;
                                               ,&#13;
to the DUtch at the time we agreed in              pri~iple   to extend the    c~osing   date, and&#13;
therefore we have decided that for the three months' extension period, we should&#13;
continue to charge only the It% commitment on the undisbursed portion of the loan&#13;
At the same time, we proposed to inform the Dutch representative that if they&#13;
should find it :necessary to apply for a further extension, we shall feel ourselvel&#13;
&#13;
free to impose the full interest rate.&#13;
I would now like to state the situation with regard to the Philippines.                      The&#13;
Bank has had a fact-finding mission there under               Mr. Beecroft, studying conditions&#13;
out there.     Mention has been made that the Philippines might come to the Bank&#13;
with a request for a loan for a hydro-electric project.                     The mission is&#13;
expected to return to Washington today, and will put in their report.&#13;
Finland : -     The President has had an application, or rather an intimation&#13;
from the Finnish Legation in washington that the -Government of Finland is&#13;
contemplating applying to the Bank for a $100 million to finance reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
The President has returned an answer to the Finnish Minister, saying that the&#13;
                                  -'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
application of course would require to be examined by the Bank in the usual way,&#13;
and the treatment of the application will take the normal course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       - 723 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                         (&#13;
                                             -   3&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF :      czechoslovakia:-      I think sir, the Board is already" aware that. arrangements&#13;
(c&lt;' '1..)&#13;
             have been made to send a small mission to czechoslovakia to investigate&#13;
&#13;
             corrlitions in that country, in the light of a possible application of the Czech&#13;
&#13;
             Government for a loan.     Arrangements have been made for the mission to leave&#13;
&#13;
             the U.S. today, and to arrive in Prague on 'March 12.      On the way to Prague there&#13;
&#13;
             are one or two other jobs in EUrope that we would have wished the Mission to do,&#13;
&#13;
             which would have delayed them probably     4 or 5 days on their journey to&#13;
             Czechoslovakia.    When we read over the week-end of developments in Prague, we&#13;
&#13;
             came to the conclusion that perhaps this was not a very suitable or opportune&#13;
&#13;
             moment to send the Bank mission, and consequently, we have postponed the'&#13;
&#13;
             departure of the mission until the situation has clarified.       I   saw a&#13;
             representative of the czech   Embas~    yesterday, and I told him of our decision â&#128;¢.&#13;
&#13;
             I said tha.t we still hoped we might be able to work to the March 12 date, as it&#13;
&#13;
             would be quite inconvenient, on the other hand, if the mission did not get there&#13;
&#13;
             then, because all arrangements had been made â&#128;¢      At the same time I pointed out&#13;
&#13;
             the situation was still rather obscure, and not until it clarified did we feel&#13;
&#13;
             that there would be aI\,V' very useful purpose served by sending the mission to&#13;
&#13;
             czechoslovakia.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI     Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, what date was contemplated for the mission's arrival&#13;
&#13;
             in Czechoslovakia ?&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF        March 12.   Mexico:-     we are at the moment considering an application for a loan&#13;
&#13;
             of the order of $20 to $25 million.       There is a Mexican Light and Power Company,&#13;
&#13;
             which is a subsidiary of the Sofina, the Belgian Company.       This is a project for&#13;
&#13;
             the development of electric power in Mexico.       The project was first put to the&#13;
&#13;
             EXport-Import Bank, and they referred it to us as being the sort of project that&#13;
&#13;
             perhaps might interest the International Bank.       In prinCiple, the project is an&#13;
&#13;
             attractive one to us.     The Mexican Government is very favourably disposed&#13;
&#13;
             towards it, and we understand that the Government itself would give ita very&#13;
&amp;#12;                           (&#13;
                                         - 4 -&#13;
&#13;
ILT1:'ll' :    high priority in their development projects, am would also be prepared to give&#13;
(C       d.)&#13;
               it the necessary Government guarantee.      In some   w~s,   the project, for reasons&#13;
&#13;
               of detail, is perhaps not as attractive to us as a similar project in Brazil, but&#13;
&#13;
               it is the sort of scheme that the Bank would like to further.        We are now&#13;
&#13;
               examining the details, and we hope to come to a quick decision and say whether or&#13;
&#13;
               not it is the sort of scheme we might be prepared to lend money for.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK          May I ask one question?      Has it been settled definitely that this is a loan we&#13;
&#13;
               should make, and not the Export-Import Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF          Well, the EXport-Import Bank wruld be quite happy that we should make the loan,&#13;
&#13;
               but if we do not find it possible to do so, I think the :EXport-Import Bank "WOuld&#13;
&#13;
               look at the project again.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:         On what basis?    If we do not do it, why should they do it ?&#13;
&#13;
HOAR :         I think sir, the officers of the Export-Import Bank would like us to take it on,&#13;
&#13;
               but we have not been able to weigh it up on two grounds.         First, there is the&#13;
&#13;
               question of the Company itself, and secomly, the position of Mexico which we&#13;
&#13;
               should be able to reach some conclusions on upon receipt of information from&#13;
&#13;
               Mexico, which has beenrnlayed and has not yet arrived.         Until we have been able&#13;
&#13;
               to do this, we cannot say lmether we would go further on this loan or not, and&#13;
&#13;
               as far as the Export-Import Bank is concerned, the position is that we will leave&#13;
&#13;
               it open until we know i f we can carry it or not.&#13;
&#13;
MEYER          Does this application fit in with the other applications formerly made by the&#13;
&#13;
               Mexican Government?    Is this included in the pattern of those applications,&#13;
&#13;
               or is it something different?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN       It is not included.   This suddenly came to us, and we said to the&#13;
&#13;
               representative of the Company that came to us that we did not want to become&#13;
&#13;
               involved in this unless we hear from the Mexican Government that it would like&#13;
&#13;
               to deflect our attention from what we were already doing to this.         I have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 725 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CTl:lMAN       informed, not formally yet nor officially, but authoritatively, that thereupon&#13;
(C~.ltd.   )&#13;
               the company did consult the Finance Minister of Mexico and got his statemant that&#13;
               they were prepared to put this even above the projects that they were talking&#13;
               about with us, and that they were prepared to give us the guarantee.         I would&#13;
&#13;
               like to have that confirmed officially before we act upon it, but it is different&#13;
&#13;
               from what we were talking about before.&#13;
&#13;
:MEYER         In the meantime I suppose the GOvernment representative is in contact with the&#13;
&#13;
               Bank for the other projects.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIR.'MAN     Yes, and bas also been advised about this one.    Although I have not seen him,&#13;
               I have heard he has nOW' said he has received instructions from the GOvernment to&#13;
               give this one priority, although the other discussions may contime. 'What we&#13;
               are anxious to do is to c,ome to a quick decision whether to take it on or not.&#13;
               The EXPort-Import Bank is insistent upon its being a long term proposition and&#13;
               our taking a look at it before we make up our minds to do it or not.         Our&#13;
&#13;
               intention is not to hold it too long, so that if we do not do it, there would&#13;
               be no embarrassment on the part of the Export-Import Bank in going.ahead.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK          The reason that I brought the point up is that I like the type of loan for this&#13;
               Bank and I feel that we should do a particular loan we approve of.      It would&#13;
               be rather unfortunate for the EXPort-Import Bank to do it either before or after.&#13;
               I   cannot see any reason why they should do it if we turn it down, unless they&#13;
               are willing to do something we would not do.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN       That brings up another issue, but it is no use talking about it now :- whether&#13;
               you make sound loans or whether you donlt make sound loans.    Go   ahead,&#13;
               Mr. Iliff.&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF          Then sir, comes Chile.    The position at present about the Chilean loan is&#13;
               this.    We have drawn up a draft loan agreement, Yfhich has been handed to the&#13;
               Chilean representative.    He has taken it away with him to consider it, and we&#13;
               hope the matter of the Chilean loan will be cleared up within a week or ten days.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              _   7?h _&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                -    6 -&#13;
&#13;
IL'     :         As soon as the details have been finally agreed with the Chileans, we shall&#13;
(Cb~.6d.    )&#13;
                  of course present the full report to the Board, giving details of the loan.&#13;
&#13;
                  Finally, there is Brazil, and here I get into water that is rather too deep&#13;
&#13;
                  for me.    With your permission, I would like to ask Mr. Hoar to explun.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:         Before you 'go on to Brazil, Mr. Iliff, may   I add something a1xl:t, Chile.     The&#13;
&#13;
                  project now is a power project, plus some agricultural machinery.        We have&#13;
&#13;
                  indicated as to the other facets of the Chilean plan, that we were not prepared&#13;
&#13;
                  to finance them at this time, but would be prepared to continue our study and&#13;
&#13;
                  exploration of them, and that the granting of the loan we now have in&#13;
&#13;
                  contemplation did not mean rejection of the other projects which include&#13;
&#13;
                  primarily-the electrification of railroads, port development and other things.&#13;
&#13;
                  We are not around yet to the point where we can finance them but that doeen't&#13;
&#13;
                  mean that we could not do so some time in the future.&#13;
&#13;
SUi   ..iffiSAN   What is the amount ?&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF :           $13 to $15 million, covering four items altogether.&#13;
HOAR :            It also covers two or three supplementaryfuings.      In the hydro-electric&#13;
&#13;
                  development, it leaves out one in the south which, i f it were constructed,&#13;
&#13;
                  would produce 30,000 kilowatts which ever,ybody admits is beyond requirements at&#13;
&#13;
                  the moment, which do hot exceed 18,000 kilowatts.     We Â£elt it would be better&#13;
&#13;
                  to leave that out.&#13;
&#13;
  BARANSKI         What is the amount of the Chilean proposal ?&#13;
&#13;
  CHAIRMAN        $13 - $15 millions.&#13;
  HOAR :          Wii;h Brazil, I think I need only give an outline.     We are in an adva:r:w::ed stage&#13;
&#13;
                  with that loan, and should be able to come to the Board very shortly.            First of&#13;
&#13;
                  au   with regard to the relations with the Brazilian Government, there is a&#13;
&#13;
                  representati ve of the Government here in washington at the moment and     lie    are&#13;
&#13;
                  having conversations, mainly about the guarantee agreement.       On that we have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    - 727 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  (&#13;
                                                -   7 -&#13;
&#13;
HO      :       had some arguments with the Brazilian Government over the straightforward&#13;
(CCiâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢ c.d. )&#13;
                negative pledge which we have in our other agreements.          This the Brazilian&#13;
&#13;
                Government argues is not strictly applicable and relative to this situation,&#13;
&#13;
                because of the fact that we are lending to the Company and taking security&#13;
&#13;
                for the loan which makes a di!ferent situation there.         However, the Brazilian&#13;
&#13;
                Government have expressed willingness to give us preference in the matter of&#13;
&#13;
                allocation of foreign exchange for the service of our loan so that no other&#13;
&#13;
                Brazilian loan will step in front of us.          That is all that we are really&#13;
&#13;
                interested in and we are in the process of seeing whether we can fim a clause&#13;
&#13;
                giving the assurance we ""ant and also acceptable to the Brazi1.ian Government.&#13;
&#13;
                on the Brazilian r,overnm.ent side, there is still outstanding the question        or&#13;
                legislation which the congress down there will pass enabling the Government to&#13;
&#13;
                give the guarantee.         The Congress is at the moment adjourned and will&#13;
&#13;
                reconvene on March    15.      Then discussions on this legislation will&#13;
&#13;
                recommence.   We do not know how long the delays may be, and we are anxious&#13;
&#13;
                that Dr. Bulhoes, the representative of the Brazilian Goverrnnent, will remain&#13;
&#13;
                so that i f discussions should go in any direction we do not like, we can&#13;
&#13;
                express our views.          There is also the question of Brazil communicating its&#13;
&#13;
                parity to the FUnd, which is not yet clear, though we understand from&#13;
&#13;
                Dr. BUlboes that this matter will come up soon, which we hope will be the&#13;
&#13;
                case.   Wi. th regard to the agreements With the Company, there are two.           The&#13;
&#13;
                first one that was drafted has been re-cast to some extent in the last week or&#13;
&#13;
                two, in order to facilitate the passing out of the loan fran our portfolio to&#13;
&#13;
                the market at a later stage if that consideration should be possible.           We are&#13;
&#13;
                hoping to get that put into shape in the course of next week, and we are           gettin~&#13;
&#13;
                along well with the Company on that.          Also there is the question of the proposed&#13;
&#13;
                undertaking that the Compa.ny would enter into which would set up many of the&#13;
&#13;
                subsidiaries behind the loan.         That would be discussed of course following upon&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    - 728 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 -     8 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HOAR :        the loan agreement itself.             All these things are in an advanced stage,         am&#13;
(contd.)&#13;
              I won't go into details.      We hope to come to the Board very soon now.&#13;
&#13;
SUNDARESAN    What rill be the amount of the loan ?&#13;
&#13;
HOAR :        About   $75 millions.&#13;
lLLANES       How mu.ch would the Bank take of that ?&#13;
&#13;
HOAR :        That would be the Bank's loan; the rest of the programme would be spread out&#13;
&#13;
              and financed out of their own resources.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN      We cut out everything but power and telephones.&#13;
&#13;
HOAR :        Gas, water and urban transportation were in the original projects, and have&#13;
&#13;
              been struck out.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN      Has anybody any further questions about the loans ?&#13;
                                               ment                      1        .&#13;
HOPPENOT      May we assume that, on the postponellof the                l~,    this is an exception to the&#13;
&#13;
              decision which has been taken, regarding charging full interest ?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     In connection with the Dutch loan?                  yes.       Have we notified the DUtch about&#13;
&#13;
              it, Mr. Iliff?&#13;
&#13;
lUFF :        Not yet, sir.      We propose to do so today.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN      Does the Board have any thoughts?&#13;
&#13;
BLACK :       I think the solution a good one.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN      Does anybody dissent ?&#13;
&#13;
                                 (NO dissents)&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     An;rthing else ?&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANI :   Would it be possible for the Board to have some information about the&#13;
&#13;
              conversations on the Italian loan application ?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN      Mr. Iliff, where do we stand on Italy ?&#13;
&#13;
HOAR :        I will ask Mr.     Hill to answer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      ;.. 729 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  9 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  Mr. Chairman, in the matter of the Italian loan application, we sent a&#13;
                  fact finding mission to    Italy last summer.    The report of that mission&#13;
&#13;
                  was considered earUer this year ani it was then decided to define our&#13;
&#13;
                  attitude on a provisional basis to the Italian Government.      The main points&#13;
&#13;
                  are that there are certain industries in     Italy which undoubtedly require&#13;
&#13;
                  modernization and the Bank provisionally is quite willing to consider possible&#13;
&#13;
                  loans to certain industries.     We are willing to send a further mission to&#13;
&#13;
                  Italy if the Italian Government so desires, and will do so in the near future&#13;
&#13;
                  to give some assistance in Rome to the Italian authorities in drawing up more&#13;
                  precise schemes which the Bank will consider for financing.      It was also made&#13;
&#13;
                  clear that at this particular stage no commitment could be made and that it&#13;
&#13;
                  may have to be postponed until what is generally known as the Marshall&#13;
&#13;
                  situation has become a little clearer.&#13;
&#13;
Blh....,JIANI :   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:         I think it is quite obvious that we cannot do a.I'\V"thing in Italy until that&#13;
&#13;
                  situation is cleared up this summer; also other situations in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
                  Mr. Black, have you anything you want to report on borrowing, or bonds, or&#13;
&#13;
                  anything?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                  ~~.   Black is continuing his forceful representations to the Legislature of&#13;
&#13;
                  the Commonwealth of Virginia.    The Savings Bank legislation in   !~s8achusetts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  is also pending.    ilhere else are we?   We have got somebody in the southwest.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:            We have a man in the South and Southwest calling on Bank Commissioners in&#13;
&#13;
                  states where we have to get rulings fran those commissioners as to whether&#13;
&#13;
                  our bonds are legal.    He is going to many different states.    "e have made&#13;
&#13;
                  progress in getting additional legislation and additional rulings.      We&#13;
&#13;
                  arE:) going to prepare shortly a new booklet giving the states where we now&#13;
&#13;

CHAIRMAN:      Is Ohio up?&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:         There is nothing we can do there.   The Legislature does not meet until too&#13;
&#13;
               fall.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:      Has anybody anthing else?   That is all on my agenda.&#13;
