            Government inspections of firms are
            important for enforcing regulations to protect public
            health, safety, and the environment and to carry out
            economic functions such as tax collection and banking
            regulation. But most inspection regimes in developing
            countries impose excessive costs on firms while failing
            dismally to prevent accidents or mitigate losses from
            disasters. There is a strong interest in models of reform
            that will reduce the burden of government inspections while
            improving standards. This paper offers solutions that do both.
