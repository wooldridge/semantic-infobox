            Getting the private sector involved in

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water has historically been hugely
            underpriced in most developing countries.  Water systems are
            often poorly run.  Regulatory frameworks are often lacking,
            incomplete, or internally inconsistent, and the relevant
            skills thinly spread.  There is little trust that the
            government will maintain a favorable operating environment
            and a tariff yielding a reasonable rate of return.  It is
            not a setting attractive to the private sector.  While much
            stands in the way of private provision of water services in
            the poorer countries, the following four options,
            individually or in combination, may speed transformation: 1)
            taking a stepwise approach; 2) simplifying contracts; 3)
            contracting out parts of the regulatory function; and 4)
            increasing predictability in the use of discretion.  There
            is often a sharp difference between what private companies
            see as a minimal return necessary to go into business in a
            risky country and what governments view as an acceptable
            level of profit.  Governments should be realistic about the
            profits that they should allow, recognizing the need of
            their private partners to earn a reasonable return and to be
            rewarded for the risks that they shoulder.
