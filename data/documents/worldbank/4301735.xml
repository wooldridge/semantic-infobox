                                         (IDA Credit3539-TJ)&#13;
                        Release of the SecondTranche - Full Compliance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         I. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
1.       The Second Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC2) was a core element o f the previous&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy for Tajikistan, dated April 14, 1998. SAC2 supports an ambitious&#13;
structural program as Tajikistan, the poorest CIS country, emerges from its post-conflict&#13;
situation.    Important objectives o f the supported reform program include: (i)to increase&#13;
transparency and accountability o f the public sector; (ii)to improve effectiveness and efficiency&#13;
of public resource use; (iii)to facilitate private sector growth and to broaden economic&#13;
opportunities; and (iv) to reduce fiscal and quasi-fiscal drain created not least by soft budget&#13;
constraints in the state sector. Correspondingly, the program focuses on four areas: (a) public&#13;
sector management; (b) the budget process; (c) private sector development and privatization; and&#13;
(d) utilities andpublic enterprise reform. The closing date o f SAC2 was extendedby a total o f 18&#13;
months, primarily to allow for the resolution o f outstanding issues regarding the largest public&#13;
enterprise in the country, the aluminium smelter TADAZ, and the privatization strategy for&#13;
mediumandlarge enterprises. These outstanding issues have now beenresolved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              11.     RECENT   ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
2.       Tajikistan's economic recovery has continued with aggregate real growth o f close to 40&#13;
percent over the last 4 years, one o f the strongest growth performances in the region. Despite&#13;
slower growth incotton and aluminum production, real GDP growth reached 10.2percent in2003,&#13;
driven to some extent by demand associated with increased workers' remittances. The recent&#13;
Poverty Update found that as are result o f rapid growth, poverty has declined significantly between&#13;
1999 and 2003 but remains high. Inflation continues to be a cause for concern at an annual rate o f&#13;
14 percent by end-2003. But quarterly data indicate that a recent monetary tightening i s succeeding&#13;
incontrolling inflation.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The fiscal performance has continued to improve, with a surplus o f 0.9 percent o f GDP in&#13;
2003, excluding the foreign financed public investment program (PIP). This reflects expenditure&#13;
discipline and hgher-than-projected tax revenues associated with higher-than-projected GDP&#13;
growth. Tajikistan's extemal balance is also improving. The current account deficit shrank to 1.3&#13;
percent o f GDP in 2003 fkom 2.6 percent o f GDP in 2002. The trade deficit declined to US$ 83&#13;
million in 2003, compared to US$ 124 million in 2002. The total extemal debt stock stood at an&#13;
estimated 73 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2003, down from 82 percent o f GDP in 2002.&#13;
Currently, the Government i s in the process o f concluding a debt restructuring agreement with&#13;
Russia.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) o f the PRSP Progress Report for 2003 presented to the&#13;
Boards o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Development Association&#13;
(IDA) highlights the good growth performance and significant poverty reduction. However, it also&#13;
notes that the progress in structural reforms has been mixed. To ensure sustainability o f economic&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 growth, the JSA stresses the importance o f continued reform efforts to further strengthen&#13;
 governance, to accelerate structural reform and private sector development, and to prioritize&#13;
 expenditures to further improve the allocation o f scarce fiscal resources.&#13;
&#13;
 5.      IMF Program: The IMF Board approved a request for a Three-Year Arrangement under&#13;
 the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility on December 11, 2002, in a total amount equivalent to&#13;
 SDR 65 million. The IMF program is currently on track. So far, SDR 25.8 million has been&#13;
 released under this current program. The next IMF staffvisit i s planned for July/August 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     111.   PROGRESSAGAINSTTRANCHE            RELEASE    CRITERIA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 6.      Pursuantto Section 2.02 (d) o fthe Development Credit Agreement (DCA) that was signed&#13;
 between the Republic o f Tajikistan and the International Development Association (IDA), dated&#13;
 July 9, 2001, conditions for the second tranche release require that the Association be satisfied: (a)&#13;
 with the progress acheved by the Borrower in the carrying out o f the Program; (b) with the&#13;
 macroeconomic policy framework o f the Borrower, measured on the basis o f agreed indicators;&#13;
 and (c) that actions described in Schedule 2 to the Development Credit Agreement have been&#13;
 taken.&#13;
&#13;
 A.      ProgressUnder the OverallProgram&#13;
&#13;
 7.      Substantial progress has been made inthe implementation o f the Program as outlined inthe&#13;
Letter o f Development Policy, the matrix o f overall reform actions under the Credit, and&#13;
 supplementary measures agreed during the supervision dialogue. While Tajihstan's daunting&#13;
reform agenda will require a sustained reform effort over many more years, the progress that has&#13;
been made to date with the overall reform program is deemed satisfactory for the disbursement o f&#13;
the second tranche o f SAC2 by IDA. Inparticular, progress has been made inthe areas o f public&#13;
sector management, the budget process, privatization and public sector development, and utility&#13;
andpublic enterprise reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.      Public Sector Management: Substantial improvements were achieved in the area o f&#13;
public sector management within the framework o f SAC2. The law "On the National Bank o f&#13;
Tajikistan" has been amended with a provision prohibiting the issuance o f directed credits. In&#13;
order to better control inspections o f private sector entities by state bodies, a Black Book&#13;
mechanism was introduced that helps monitor the nature and frequency o f inspections. The laws&#13;
"On State Financial Control" and "On Public Finance" have come into force inDecember 2002,&#13;
thus creating the regulatory basis for the activities o f the State Financial Control Committee, the&#13;
Supreme Audit Institution in Tajikistan. With the support o f the Institution Building and&#13;
Technical Assistance 2 Project, functional reviews o f Government ministries were conducted&#13;
which led to the partial or full restructuring o f the Ministries o f Health, Education, Agriculture&#13;
and Telecommunications. The Ministryo f State Revenues and Duties was established inJanuary&#13;
2002 and started modernizing the Customs and the Tax Codes, which have been redrafted with&#13;
technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank and U S A I D and are currently being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 reviewed within the Government. Inparallel, an internal audit department has been set up within&#13;
that Ministryinorder to increase accountability and to fight corruption.&#13;
&#13;
 9.      Budget Process: There have been noticeable improvements o f the budget process under&#13;
 SAC2. Individual bank accounts o f Ministries have been closed by early 2002 and all transactions&#13;
 are now channeled through a single consolidated account at the Treasury. The law "On State&#13;
Finances" enacted in December 2002 i s a well drafted and modern law on budget processes.&#13;
However, the full implementation o f t h s law proved slow due to the limited capacity o f the&#13;
Ministry o f Finance and line ministries, and the fragmented nature o f the budget preparation&#13;
process. The Government developed its first medium-term budget fi-amework (MTBF) for 2002-&#13;
2004, which links policy, planning and budgeting decisions over the planning and resource&#13;
management cycle. While this is an important first step, a full and effective integration o f the&#13;
MTBFinto the budget process has yet to be achieved. A Budget Commission was set up, but met&#13;
only twice and was later dissolved since its role had not been clearly defined. The Ministry o f&#13;
Finance is currently preparing a second attempt to establish a Budget Commission as a high level&#13;
forum for strategic prioritization o f the executive. The Public Investment Program (PIP) is now&#13;
officially part o f the budget process, and counterpart funding is listed as a distinct expenditure item&#13;
within the State Budget. However, the process linking MTBF, PIP and the State Budget will need&#13;
to be improved further.&#13;
&#13;
 10.    Private Sector Development and Privatization: Progress both on farm privatization and&#13;
enterprise privatization has been made during the SAC2 period. To facilitate farm privatization, the&#13;
Government adopted a resolution in late 2001 reducing the fee for issuance o f land use right&#13;
certificates to US$ 6. There have been some reports that local officials add informal payment&#13;
requests to this official fee, a practice that may not always be easy to control but that needs to be&#13;
prosecuted vigorously. Inorder to improve the land-use rights procedure, the budget for the issuing&#13;
agency has been raised significantly and new technical equipment has been acquired. To date,&#13;
more than 21,000 land use certificates have been issued to individual farmers and Dehqon farms.&#13;
The Tax Code was amended to pilot a single farm tax infour districts inAugust 2002. Manuals on&#13;
reorganization and privatization o f collective and state farms have been published in the mass&#13;
media and 556 out o f 700 state and collective farms havebeen restructured.&#13;
&#13;
The improvement in court access benefits businesses more widely as the court fee has been&#13;
lowered to 2 percent of the claim value by Resolution o f the Government inearly 2002. Over 250&#13;
mediumandlarge enterprises have beenprivatized since SAC2 was signed. InNovember 2003, the&#13;
Government adopted a comprehensive and time bound Strategic Plan for the Privatization o f&#13;
Medium and Large Enterprises and the Restructuring o f Natural Monopolies and the Largest&#13;
Enterprises for 2004-2007,       covering almost 500 remaining state owned companies. New&#13;
regulations on the auction and biddingprocess to implement this plan have been approved by the&#13;
Government in early 2004. Improved bankruptcy and liquidation procedures are being developed&#13;
that are also required for the implementation o f the new privatization strategy. A continued timely&#13;
andsolid implementation o fthe privatizationplanwill be critical.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Utilities and Public Enterprise Reform: The key public utilities, TajikGas, TajikTelecom,&#13;
and BarkiTajik (the electricity utility) have significantly improved collection rates and a large&#13;
majority o f clients are current within 90 days sales equivalent on their payments under threat o f&#13;
disconnection. In late 2001, the Government adopted a resolution requiring all budget entities to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   adequately plan their utility expenditures and not to accumulate utility arrears. After initial delays,&#13;
   the most significant arrears problem, the electricity arrears o f the aluminium smelter TADAZ, the&#13;
   largest industrial enterprise inTajikistan consuming one third o f the country's domestic electricity&#13;
   output, has now been credibly addressed and a pattern o f timely payment o f electricity bills has&#13;
  been established. In 2002, the Prime Minister approved a time-bound action plan for TADAZ,&#13;
   incorporating measures for financial and operational restructuring, re-capitalization, and technical&#13;
   rehabilitation. In order to implement this action plan, the U K ' s Department for International&#13;
   Development has recently agreed to fund outside financial and technical advisors who are expected&#13;
  to take up their work over the next few months. An international independent audit o f TADAZ's&#13;
   2002 financial statements has been recently completed andwas found to comply with international&#13;
   audit standards (IAS) after an earlier version o f the audit had been rejected. The I A S audit o f&#13;
  BarkiTajik is scheduled for September 2004 andwill be financed by the Asian Development Bank.&#13;
  An audit o f TajikGas is also hopedto be carried out later this year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  B.       Macroeconomicpolicyframework&#13;
&#13;
   12.     As suggested in paragraphs 2-5 above, which includes an update on the status o f the IMF&#13;
  program, IDA considers that the current macroeconomic fiamework in Tajikistan is satisfactory.&#13;
  The proceeds o f the second tranche are part o f the 2004 budget endorsed by the IMF. The&#13;
  proceeds will provide budgetary support to help the government service external debt and finance&#13;
  its poverty reduction agenda. With the 2004 budget, spending on the key social services o f health&#13;
  and education continues to increase as a share o f total expenditure, and, a fortiori, as a share o f&#13;
  GDP.&#13;
&#13;
  C.      ProgressAgainst SpecificTrancheRelease Criteria&#13;
 !Schedule2 DCA, Section 1:The law on the FinancialControlOfficehasbeenenacted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Status -  Compliance: Parliament has adopted the Law "On State Financial Control" on 17 April&#13;
  2002 (#615) which defines the criteria, rates and rules o f conducting inspections o f enterprises'&#13;
  and organizations' activities. This Law came into force on December 2,2002 (#62).&#13;
&#13;
  Remark: According to this law, the State Financial Committee is the supreme audit institution.&#13;
  As it stands, the State Financial Committee reports to the President only. This can give rise to&#13;
  conflicts o f interest as the President is the head o f the executive. As a next step, parliamentary&#13;
  involvement inthe oversight would be desirable, possibly through the establishment o f an&#13;
  additional audit institution that would supervise the work o f the State Financial Committee and&#13;
  would report to Parliament.&#13;
I Schedule2 DCA, Section2: The Borrower has made satisfactoryprogress inimplementinga                      I&#13;

  Status - Compliance: While further efforts will berequired, progress inthe revisiono fthe&#13;
 customs code inline with international standardshas been satisfactory for the purpose o f SAC2.&#13;
 The current Customs Code was initially adopted inApril 1995 andwas amended inAugust 2001,&#13;
 In2003, anentirelynewcustoms codewas preparedto fully complywith international standards&#13;
 by a working group ofthe Ministryo f State Revenues andDuties.This draft is modeledonthe&#13;
 new Customs Code adoptedbythe RussianFederation in2003 and is currentlybeingreviewed&#13;
 by other Government Ministries. A preliminaryassessment by aWorld Bank consultant hasbeen&#13;
 prepared, recommending that the draft be revisedina number o f areas to assure full compliance&#13;
 with WTO andother best practice requirements.This assessment has been sharedwith ADB and&#13;
 USAIDwho intendto offer further assistance. IfParliament adopts the new customs code in&#13;
 2004, it could become effective January 1,2005.&#13;
&#13;
