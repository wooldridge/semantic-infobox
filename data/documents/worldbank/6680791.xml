&#13;
                                              INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
Each year the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) engages with client countries, partners and other&#13;
stakeholders in a process of developing a work plan for the coming fiscal year (July 1 ­ June 30). This&#13;
document presents the fiscal year 2006 (FY06) business plan.&#13;
&#13;
The annual business plan is developed within the context of the overall guidance and strategic directions&#13;
set by the WSP Council. Each specific country activity is planned in consultation with country and&#13;
regional stakeholders, external partners, embassies and local representatives of donor agencies, and World&#13;
Bank staff. At the country and regional level, the WSP regional offices conduct consultation processes to&#13;
ensure a bottom-up build up of the business plan. The draft comprehensive business plan is presented to&#13;
the WSP Council in its annual meeting. The draft FY06 business plan was presented to the WSP Council&#13;
at its meeting in Switzerland. The present version of the FY06 business plan includes the comments and&#13;
guidance received during this meeting.&#13;
&#13;
The FY06 business plan is divided into six sections, a global framework, four regional chapters following&#13;
the organizational structure of WSP ­ Africa, East Asia/Pacific, Latin America/Caribbean, and South Asia&#13;
­ and the global activities. Each regional chapter includes a regional strategy that outlines the particular&#13;
challenges, opportunities, and strategies for the water and sanitation (WSS) sector in that region. The&#13;
regional strategies lead to country and thematic strategies that further define the role WSP will play in its&#13;
focus countries. The regional chapters include summary descriptions of the activities to be implemented&#13;
as annual work plans (AWPs). Annex 1 presents the individual project sheets that expand the description&#13;
in a simplified log-frame structure, with special emphasis on intermediate and final outcomes and&#13;
indicators.&#13;
&#13;
GLOBAL WSP BUSINESS PLAN FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
This section presents a brief introduction to the WSP Business Plan framework, including WSP's mission&#13;
and services, focus country selection, WSP's comparative advantage, and the Program's planning process&#13;
and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system. The section also summarizes the FY06 portfolio of&#13;
activities, the implementation of the recommendations from the 2004 external review of WSP, and the&#13;
establishment of the Global Practice Teams.&#13;
&#13;
WSP Mission and Services&#13;
The mission of the Water and Sanitation Program is to alleviate poverty by helping poor people gain&#13;
sustained access to improved water and sanitation services. It does this by working with partners in the&#13;
field to seek innovative solutions to the obstacles faced by poor communities, and by striving to be a&#13;
valued source of advice to achieve widespread adoption of these solutions. To achieve its mission, WSP&#13;
aspires to be one of the world's leading sources of knowledge, advice and ideas; and a leading country&#13;
facilitator in the implementation of successful policies and practices whose impact is to extend sustainable&#13;
water and sanitation service access to the poor in rural and urban environments.&#13;
&#13;
Over its twenty-year history the WSP has evolved into a unique, field based, learning and policy&#13;
facilitation network, supported through a partnership of the world's leading development agencies. It has&#13;
an established track record and a compelling mission. Over the years WSP has attracted staff with a&#13;

Introduction                                                                             FY06 Business Plan&#13;

&#13;
unique combination of technical skills and values. Its location in the Bank has enhanced visibility and&#13;
provided opportunities to influence sector policies and support operational programs.&#13;
&#13;
WSP helps its clients to serve their clients. While the poor are WSP ultimate clients and Program staff&#13;
interact with unserved communities on a regular basis, its direct clients and partners at the country level&#13;
are central government departments, utilities, municipal agencies, local authorities, NGOs, community&#13;
organizations, private service providers and external support agencies.&#13;
&#13;
WSP activities are structured around a Results Framework that links its services and products with its&#13;
overall mission. This framework is translated at the activity level in a simplified logframe structure with&#13;
specific indicators of final and intermediate outcomes. Figure 1 presents WSP's results framework and&#13;
services.&#13;

&#13;
WSP services and products can be classified in five groups:&#13;
&#13;
    Policy support: Advice to help countries adopt more effective policies and strategies and to undertake&#13;
    required reforms. The mutual interaction between WSP's services, its field networking, partnership&#13;
    approach, participatory style and interactions with local decision-makers helps build countries' policy&#13;
    focus and capacity to improve service access.&#13;
    Strategic investment support: Advice and support to the investment programs of its clients and&#13;
    partners that are seeking to break new ground and generate new field knowledge or are strategically&#13;
    critical to make reforms a reality.&#13;
    Knowledge management, generation and synthesis: Generate, validate, and disseminate innovative&#13;
    solutions to water and sanitation problems and develop new sector knowledge. Drawing from&#13;
    experience in different contexts the Program can synthesize field knowledge and experience and&#13;
    communicate this to sector decision-makers.&#13;
    Sector networking: Support to networks of professionals at the country and regional level to develop&#13;
    activities, communications plans, and overall capacity building efforts. The Program also facilitates&#13;
    donor coordination activities in the WSS sector, as well as conferences and learning events.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                       2&#13;

Introduction                                                                             FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
     Pilot projects: In some cases, WSP supports donor partners and client countries with the design and&#13;
     supervision of small pilot projects that are funded by external agencies and implemented by the client&#13;
     country. WSP provides support in the design phase, and in the monitoring and learning activities to&#13;
     extract lessons on the ground that can later be replicated in scaled-up programs.&#13;
&#13;
Shift in Substantive Focus for "Going to Scale"&#13;
Over its twenty-year history, WSP substantive focus has shifted from technology (hand-pumps, VIP&#13;
latrines) to community participation and mobilization and, more recently, to sector policies and strategies.&#13;
The broad global movement toward decentralization, participatory governance and increased reliance on&#13;
the private sector, as well as the lagging performance in delivering services, has triggered changes in&#13;
WSS sector policies. One of the key challenges to sector professionals and organizations is to find ways&#13;
to make significant and rapid progress against these problems while also embracing the need to build&#13;
ownership and capacity at the local level. Many developing countries have in fact adopted WSS policies&#13;
that incorporate the principles of the Dublin-Rio consensus, yet they lack the legal and institutional&#13;
framework as well as the capacity and the tools to organize and support local actors (local authorities,&#13;
utilities, community-based organizations and private operators) in expanding and improving WSS&#13;
services. The MDGs have catalyzed a renewed emphasis on the achievement of specific targets in the&#13;
provision of water and sanitation services, which requires a clear and active shift towards scaled-up&#13;
investment programs supported by well-designed policy and sector reforms.&#13;
&#13;
As WSP is responding to the challenge of "going to scale", it has re-assessed its substantive focus. Recent&#13;
operations and strategy setting exercises suggest three main directions:&#13;
· WSP institutional focus is shifting toward the interface between local authorities and WSS service&#13;
     providers;&#13;
· WSP advisory work on investment to focus increasingly on financing mechanisms and sector&#13;
     programs as well as the WSS components of poverty reduction strategies and programs arising from&#13;
     the PRSP process; and&#13;
· The development of the capacity for learning and knowledge sharing among local actors is&#13;
     emerging as a key element of scaling up strategies.&#13;
This reassessment will continue as WSP prepares an updated program strategy in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
WSP Focus Countries&#13;
WSP seeks to have reach and impact in all regions where the poor have inadequate water and sanitation&#13;
services and where there are lessons to be learnt on how to apply successful solutions. WSP is currently&#13;
engaged across four regions in the following countries:&#13;
&#13;
     i)   Africa ­ Benin, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique,&#13;
          Senegal, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia,&#13;
     ii) East Asia and Pacific ­ Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Vietnam&#13;
     iii) Latin America and the Caribbean ­ Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru&#13;
     iv) South Asia ­ Bangladesh, India, Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
The level of engagement of WSP in any given country is the result of a combination of factors including&#13;
strategic fit, history and funding. As it seeks to maximize its global impact, WSP continues to adopt a&#13;
strategic and coherent approach in assessing the breadth and depth of its involvement in specific&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
The number of countries in which the Program operates should be limited to those in which the Program&#13;
can make a demonstrable and significant difference. Facilitating change generally requires country&#13;
presence and will be undertaken in strategically selected focus countries using the following criteria:&#13;

&#13;
Investment advice and knowledge-collecting operations from countries where there are important lessons&#13;
to be learnt will generally not require field presence and can be achieved through short-term missions,&#13;
outsourcing or studies. All countries, including those not directly targeted by WSP will be reached&#13;
through regional and global conferences as well as WSP publications and knowledge management&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
Services to the focus countries are provided through a combination of a small management team in&#13;
Washington; regional hubs in Peru, Kenya, India, and Indonesia; and country offices with WSP field&#13;
staff.&#13;
&#13;
WSP Comparative Advantage&#13;
An independent evaluation of WSP was commissioned by its Council to review the Program activities&#13;
over the period 1999-2003. The external evaluation's overall finding is that WSP was effective and&#13;
efficient in the service of valuable objectives during the review period. The evaluation concluded that: (a)&#13;
WSP's work has achieved relevant outcomes in diverse situations, with considerable impact already&#13;
observed and likely to follow; and; (b) WSP has significant comparative advantages in relation to other&#13;
organisations working in the WSS field. Its partnership style enables it to collaborate and complement&#13;
those of other organisations where appropriate. WSP's global reach, valuable contacts, long track record,&#13;
high professional capacity, and ability to maintain continuing real-time contact with key decision-makers&#13;
all give it particular advantage.&#13;
&#13;
The evaluation team reviewed WSP's comparative advantage and the Program continuously reviews them&#13;
to ensure its strengthening and refocusing to provide enhanced services to its client countries. WSP brings&#13;
to the table a unique set of experiences and qualifications to make it a valuable and uniquely qualified&#13;
partner in development of the water supply and sanitation sector and in the implementation of the type of&#13;
global/regional learning-national implementation links that are so crucial in the transfer of knowledge to&#13;
influence action at country level. WSP specifically has:&#13;
&#13;
    a) specialist knowledge through its high caliber staff that is representative of the some of the most&#13;
            up-to-date thinking and knowledge, that is field based and therefore able to effectively deal&#13;
            with local conditions&#13;
    b) Global and regional presence: the network of WSP operations and skills deployed around the&#13;
            world enables it to draw relevant global experience and create links between countries&#13;
            grappling with similar problems&#13;
    c) Independence: WSP is uniquely placed to provide independent advisory services which are&#13;
            "fire-walled" from lending and project pressures&#13;
    d) Wide network of partnerships: With over 27 years' experience and a unique partnership&#13;
            structure, WSP is able to attract a wide range of partners and coordinate interventions to&#13;
            maximize impact&#13;
    e) Potential to leverage World Bank operations: Enables WSP to create linkages between policy&#13;
            development and capacity building and future investment programs and provides potential to&#13;
            expand WSP influence beyond our client and focus countries.&#13;

Introduction                                                                               FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP Planning Process and M&amp;E System&#13;
WSP strategic planning process and M&amp;E system is based on the following constitutive elements:&#13;
· Annual business plans, including:&#13;
    · Global, regional and country strategies&#13;
    · Annual work plans and budgets&#13;
    · Individual project sheets&#13;
· Mid-year progress review&#13;
· End-year review&#13;
&#13;
The planning process begins with the preparation of the annual business plan (covering July 1 ­ June 30)&#13;
and it represents the start of WSP's management cycle. Each year, WSP staff, with inputs from&#13;
stakeholders (client countries in particular, donors and other stakeholders and partners) and taking&#13;
account of new opportunities, engage in a process of preparing the coming year's business plan.&#13;
&#13;
The business plan goes through a rigorous quality enhancement process by the HQ team to ensure&#13;
continuity, relevance, thematic coherence, and availability of adequate funds. The business plan is further&#13;
subjected to a validation process which involves Regional Advisory Committee (representatives of key&#13;
stakeholders at the regional level) and the World Bank regions to ensure synergies, strengthen collaboration&#13;
and ensure relevance to the countries in which we overlap and others beyond our focus countries. The final&#13;
step in preparation is presentation, discussion, and endorsement of the Business Plan by the WSP Council at&#13;
its annual meeting.&#13;
&#13;
Each WSP region prepares, through the process described above, regional strategies that outline the&#13;
particular obstacles, opportunities, and strategies for the WSS sector in that region.           The regional&#13;
strategies lead to country and thematic strategies that further define the role WSP will play in its focus&#13;
countries. The precise role is captured in the individual project sheets. The project sheets detail each&#13;
project that WSP works on, its objectives, and desired outcomes, indicators for the outcome, annual&#13;
activities, and estimated budget.      The current fiscal year's activities from the project sheets are&#13;
summarized in the annual work plans (AWPs) contained in the main body of the text.&#13;
&#13;
In FY06, WSP continues to strengthen the structure, logical content, and M&amp;E system for its business plan.&#13;
A new guidance note was developed to enhance the quality of the individual project sheets which is based&#13;
on a streamlined version of the logframe approach. This guidance note has supported the strengthening of&#13;
indicators for each project which are then used in the mid-term and end-year progress reviews to determine&#13;
not only completion of outputs but also progress towards intermediate and final outcomes. The individual&#13;
project sheets are included as an appendix to this business plan. In FY06, WSP also developed a new&#13;
portfolio monitoring system that is described in greater detail below.&#13;
&#13;
Key issues that have guided preparation of the FY06 business plan include:&#13;
&#13;
    a) a renewed focus on the MDGs: With only 10 years to go to achieve the WSS MDG target, there&#13;
         is a strong push for greater focus to support countries in accelerating implementation of sector&#13;
         reforms, improved governance and development of road maps, financing strategies to implement&#13;
         large scale programs and support capacity development for national and regional policy makers&#13;
         and service providers ­ this is the focus for Africa. In Asia, the focus is on efforts to bring about&#13;
         greater commitment to institutional reforms necessary to achieve the MDGs, while in LAC, the&#13;
         challenge is to integrate MDGs in government strategies.&#13;
    b) Client country demands and inputs: The core of our work is country level where we aim to&#13;
         ultimately make a difference by enhancing clients' efforts at increasing access to sustainable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Introduction                                                                                 FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         WSS services through improved policies, strategies, better design of programs to have poverty&#13;
         impact and application of innovation from WSP work. WSP seeks to support governments make&#13;
         more effective use of public funds, leverage additional funding from international financing&#13;
         agencies and improved service by strengthening and leveraging the skills of new stakeholders.&#13;
         The country is our most important client and its involvement is an important early step in the&#13;
         business planning process in guiding the scope, focus and direction of our work in any given year.&#13;
    c) Lessons from implementation of the previous years' business plans: After closure of every FY,&#13;
         WSP carries out an End of Year Review (EYR) aimed at assessing the extent to which the targets of&#13;
         the previous year's business plan are achieved and to draw lessons for strengthening&#13;
         implementation of the current year. The EYR is an important link between the previous and current&#13;
         year business plans and ensures continuity between the FYs. The regions prepare the EYR while&#13;
         HQ provides quality enhancement of the technical and financial aspects and ensures adequate&#13;
         linkage between the two FYs. The two processes are therefore closely coordinated.&#13;
&#13;
WSP FY06 Portfolio of Activities&#13;
&#13;
Following the recommendation of the 2004 external evaluation and the WSP Council request to improve&#13;
its monitoring system, WSP has undertaken in FY06 a revamping of its project coding system to better&#13;
reflect the nature of its activities. This system better reflects the multi-dimensional nature of its activities,&#13;
while maintaining a simple system for use in planning, monitoring and analysis. The coding system has&#13;
also been linked to the budgeting and financial monitoring system and is expected to provide valuable&#13;
information in the analysis of global, regional and thematic trends for the whole program.&#13;
&#13;
Each project in WSP is characterized by three different attributes: scale, sector and theme. The table&#13;
below shows the possible attributes for each project. In addition, each project is classified in three&#13;
categories, depending on the final product: knowledge management, investment/policy support, or&#13;
capacity building.&#13;

&#13;
In FY06, the most predominant themes of the portfolio include:&#13;
    · Institutional reform and capacity building (41%)&#13;
    · Investment planning and MDG action plans (8%)&#13;
    · Communications for development (8%)&#13;
    · Regulations and policy (8%)&#13;
    · Water, sanitation and health (6%)&#13;
    · Participation, civic engagement and community driven development (6%)&#13;
&#13;
Among the major new programs to be launched for implementation in FY06 are:&#13;
    i)  Africa/LAC/East Asia: MDG roadmaps to help in moving from rhetoric to concrete plans&#13;
    ii) India rural ­ state level implementation of sector reforms focusing on how to make government&#13;
        investments more effective and focused on service delivery&#13;
    iii) Indonesia sanitation: city strategies that integrate the full spectrum from planning to community&#13;
        involvement and hygiene promotion&#13;
    iv) Domestic private sector initiative focusing on how to bring in the private sector as a key&#13;
         stakeholder in the provision of WSS services&#13;
&#13;
WSP FY05-06 Implementation of External Review Recommendations&#13;
Following the recommendations of the WSP external evaluation endorsed by the Council in its 2004&#13;
annual meeting, the Program has implemented the following measures in FY05:&#13;
&#13;
    · Distribution of final evaluation report&#13;
    · Replacements for non-donor representatives on the Council identified and in place by the 2005&#13;
        Council meeting&#13;
    · Instructions issued to WSP staff reiterating the distinct nature of the Program&#13;
    · Distribution to Council of reports from the respective Regional Advisory Committees and any&#13;
        MoUs&#13;
    · New coding system to better differentiate among the categories that constitute "Cross-Cutting"&#13;
    · Revised partnership strategy&#13;
    · New communication strategy&#13;
    · New funding strategy&#13;
&#13;
The external evaluation recommended two additional actions which were supported by the Council:&#13;
&#13;
        Issuance of a short revised "Program Objective" statement&#13;
         Issuance of an explicit definition of the Program's comparative advantage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Introduction                                                                             FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
However, these two recommendations require a more detailed strategic analysis of WSP and its Council&#13;
in its 2005 meeting instructed the Program to prepare a new strategy for the period 2005-2015 (matching&#13;
the MDG target to have the support to partner countries to achieve this target at the core of the strategy).&#13;
&#13;
WSP Global Practice Teams&#13;
The 2004 external evaluation also recommended that WSP enhances its global learning and knowledge&#13;
management. In response to this recommendation, the Program established in 2005 Global Practice&#13;
Teams (GPTs). The objectives of these teams include the promotion of more cross-regional work, the&#13;
establishment of a global vision and leadership on key WSS topics, enhanced knowledge sharing and&#13;
influence of other stakeholders and partners such as the World Bank, and the promotion of rapid cross-&#13;
fertilization across WSP regions.&#13;
&#13;
GPTs were established along topics with the following criteria:&#13;
&#13;
     · A topic with on-the-ground activities in at least two regions and preferably more&#13;
     · An area of existing or intended WSP global leadership of the agenda&#13;
     · A high level of partner interest for both local action and global perspective&#13;
     · Demonstrable opportunity to influence partner or Bank/donor thinking on the topic&#13;
     · Demonstrable benefits from cross-regional knowledge sharing&#13;
     · Regional commitment to co-finance GPT activities&#13;
     · Easy identification of products with high impact and short timeframe&#13;
&#13;
The initial list of GPT topics include: rural water supply and sanitation, sanitation and hygiene, urban&#13;
WSS services to the poor, finance, and strategic communications for WSS sector reform. WSP will ensure&#13;
a balance between global and country activities and will always emphasize that the core of all its work is&#13;
at country level, and that any global or cross-regional learning and knowledge must ultimately make a&#13;
difference at country level to enhance our clients' efforts at increasing access to sustainable WSS. GPTs&#13;
are in a learning phase, and so the framework for their operation is being developed and will be refined as&#13;
lessons are learned. Their performance will be monitored closely and reported on to the WSP Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
AFRICA&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: Africa is facing an ongoing, endemic water and sanitation crisis that debilitates and kills&#13;
in large numbers, limiting economic growth, educational access, and life opportunities. Most at risk are&#13;
the poor, especially women and children in rural and growing informal settlements. Service development&#13;
cannot keep up with the pace of population growth, and overall, numbers of the unserved are increasing.&#13;
Only 62% of Africans have access to safe water (85% urban and 47% rural), the lowest regional coverage&#13;
in the world. Just 60% of the population has access to adequate sanitation. The UN Millennium Project&#13;
reports that Sub-Saharan is the region most off-track with respect to achieving the Millennium&#13;
Development Goals (MDGs) in water supply and sanitation (WSS) access.&#13;
&#13;
Achieving these goals in the ten years left before the MDG target necessitates dramatically new&#13;
approaches. The rate of institutional reforms that have been initiated in many African countries needs to&#13;
quicken and new strategies developed in fragile environments where governments are not in a position to&#13;
lead. Governments need to prioritize WSS services in poverty reduction strategies (PRS) to improve&#13;
clarity in institutional responsibilities to strengthen sector governance and transparency, decentralize&#13;
decision making, and increase service efficiency through applying business principles. Current financing&#13;
mechanisms are unsustainable - external aid accounts for over 80% of sector investments and internal&#13;
revenue cannot maintain existing services. While the sector retains the expectation of government service&#13;
delivery, public sector capacity is desperately weak at most levels. This results in Africa's poor mostly&#13;
obtaining water and disposing of excreta through household, community, or small-scale private sector&#13;
initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: WSP-Africa (WSP-AF) works within the framework of the WSS MDGs to assist client&#13;
countries in accelerating the implementation of sector reforms that focus on increasing WSS service&#13;
provision for the poor. The role of WSP-AF is to aid the initiatives of its partners in solving problems&#13;
both by providing direct advice and assistance. Its area of focus is to help develop policies, find&#13;
innovative solutions, promote best practices, and develop capacity for sustained service access. WSP-AF&#13;
strives to be a valued, high-level source of impartial advice and experience, based on comparative&#13;
knowledge of what works. Through its African field network, the Program can be a flexible and&#13;
responsive local partner to help local policy dialogues and capacity building. WSP-AF is also in a&#13;
position to test promising ideas, document lessons from their application, and encourage adoption within&#13;
larger financing plans.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has a strong track record, dating back over many years&#13;
and has established privileged and close relationships with many African governments and partners. The&#13;
Program is respected as a leading source of applied research and expertise on comparative WSS policies.&#13;
Its strengths are rural water supply program development, service delivery to peri-urban informal&#13;
settlements, management of services in small towns, financing arrangements, community-based&#13;
approaches, the development of large scale sanitation and hygiene programs, effective use of small-scale&#13;
private sector service providers, and participatory and gender-sensitive tools. As an honest broker&#13;
without a financial agenda, yet with many donor shareholders, the Program frequently plays a leading role&#13;
in improving sector coordination. Its multi-lingual network of field-based staff based in East, West, and&#13;
Southern Africa promotes the exchange of ideas across Africa and beyond. It is on hand to coach clients&#13;
through reform programs, create leverage from local partnerships, and bring grass-root level experience to&#13;
global attention.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Activity Selection and Organizational Strategy: Activity and country focus selection is&#13;
discussed with WSP-AF's stakeholders and clients in an annual regional governance meeting. WSP-AF's&#13;
strategy is to make an impact in three critical entry points to assisting African client governments meet&#13;
the WSS MDGs. 1) the promotion of sector reform, improved governance, and the development of&#13;

country-owned roadmaps to meet the MDGs; 2) assisting countries in developing sustainable financing&#13;
strategies to implement large-scale programs; and 3) providing support in developing capacity with both&#13;
regional and national policy makers and service providers.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF operates at three levels: regional, national, and thematic. At the regional level it provides&#13;
advocacy and best practice information support to the African Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW­&#13;
the office of the chair and the technical advisory committees), the secretariat of the New Partnership for&#13;
Africa's Development (NEPAD), the African Development Bank (ADB), and to regional learning&#13;
networks, such as Water Utility Partnership (WUP), Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN), AfricaSan&#13;
and the Africa Water Task Force. To enhance its impact, WSP-AF gears the majority of its support&#13;
(about 75% of budget) towards a few select focus countries. The selection criteria for focus countries&#13;
take into account both potential impact (poor countries that have a demonstrated commitment to sector&#13;
reform and in which it is judged that WSP-AF can make a significant contribution) and project viability&#13;
(demand for several WSP services and availability of a consistent financial partner to enable WSP-AF to&#13;
give a dependable service).&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's focus countries in FY06 are expected to expand from 7 countries in FY05 to the following:&#13;
Benin, Burkina Faso, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda,&#13;
and Zambia. WSP-AF also manages a substantial and separately-funded program of support in Yemen.&#13;
Country-level support generally follows the sequence of assisting clients in planning reforms, developing&#13;
strategies, and implementing investment programs. Increasingly, country plans also include helping&#13;
clients develop effective sector communication strategies.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF also responds to selected demand for support in other African countries, either with critical&#13;
entry point activities to stimulate reform or where there are significant opportunities to learn in WSP-&#13;
AF's main themes. Countries of strategic support in FY06 include, but are not restricted to: Madagascar,&#13;
Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, and South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's thematic work seeks to develop new and comparative bodies of knowledge in selected areas.&#13;
A finance team is studying WSS finance resource flows and WSS in Poverty-Reduction Strategy Papers&#13;
(PRSPs). A sanitation and hygiene team is developing a framework and tools to enhance sanitation&#13;
development and hygiene promotion. An urban poor team is working to assist utilities in creating and&#13;
implementing pro-poor strategies, and to develop practical tools for increasing the voice of poor&#13;
consumers and the effective use of the small-scale private sector. A rural team is examining institutional&#13;
approaches for large scale sustainable programs and is promoting new knowledge on borehole drilling,&#13;
sustainable handpump management and self-supply.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of Key Projects: In FY06, WSP-AF's key outputs will include the following: country-owned&#13;
roadmaps to reach the MDGs in focus countries, contributions to stronger sector coordination in countries&#13;
of focus, advocacy and diagnostic tools to improve the range and effectiveness of financial allocations to&#13;
the sector and heighten sector visibility in poverty reduction strategies, implementation of sanitation&#13;
marketing programs in selected countries, strengthened regional partnerships with AMCOW, African&#13;
Development Bank (AfDB) and WUP, support to new approaches in rural water supply and to reach the&#13;
urban poor in Africa's slums and informal settlements.&#13;
&#13;
To support national efforts to design and deliver MDG roadmaps, WSP-AF will support selected&#13;
countries to develop WSS MDG roadmaps based on the generic process developed by WSP. WSS MDG&#13;
roadmaps are planning tools aligned with and building on existing sector plans but which have a common&#13;
target related to the WSS MDGs and enable comparative tracking of progress. The support to WSS MDG&#13;
roadmaps will be buttressed by analytical research, tracking capability and regional communications. A&#13;
specific program of regional assistance will focus on the analysis of financial structures in WSS.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
The general approach suggests using and adapting the MDG-based PRSP methodology developed by the&#13;
UN Task Force. The methodology aims to integrate generic interventions, specify targets for each&#13;
intervention, estimate synergies across interventions, develop investment models, estimate resource&#13;
requirements and develop financing strategies. While the activities in the selected countries will focus on&#13;
MDG roadmap for WSS targets, the PRSP-based methodology will highlight contributions of WSS to&#13;
other MDGs and mainstream the sector into the overall development agenda. The MDG roadmaps should&#13;
be country-owned and linked to existing financial instruments such as MTEF, PRSP/PRSC and HIPC.&#13;
&#13;
To support national efforts to design and deliver MDG roadmaps, WSP-AF will support selected&#13;
countries to develop WSS MDG roadmaps based on the generic process developed by WSP. WSS MDG&#13;

target related to the WSS MDGs and enable comparative tracking of progress. The support to WSS MDG&#13;
roadmaps will be buttressed by analytical research, tracking capability and regional communications. A&#13;
specific program of regional assistance will focus on the analysis of financial structures in WSS.&#13;
&#13;
Benin&#13;
The Challenge: Poverty reduction remains a central challenge in Benin. Rural water supply has been&#13;
prioritized by the government and support partners. Coverage in rural areas is comparatively high, i.e.,&#13;
53%. Although the prospects for sustainability appear better than in the rest of Africa, this is not assured.&#13;
Supply chains for parts and services are weak and unreliable. A coherent sector financing strategy needs&#13;
to be developed in the context of the MDG challenge. Sanitation coverage, 20%, is significantly below&#13;
the African average and the sanitation and hygiene sector also needs significant support. However, severe&#13;
capacity constraints limit the potential for scaled up progress toward the WSS/MDGs. Such capacity&#13;
would have to be built up under the recently implemented policy for the decentralization of services to&#13;
municipalities which although endowed with appropriate legal powers, do not have the necessary capacity&#13;
and experience. Far-reaching reforms in urban WSS have been initiated by the unbundling of water and&#13;
electricity unto separate utilities. The newly established SONEB (Societé Nationale des Eaux du Benin)&#13;
also needs support. WSP-AF has developed a fruitful and long standing collaboration with lead sector&#13;
agencies and with Benin's development partners involved in WSS, in particular: DANIDA, GTZ, DGDC,&#13;
and the WB itself through AFTU2. WSP-AF support has so far been focused on the development and&#13;
subsequent updating of the rural RWSS strategy and to the full integration of WSS in the PRSP. The GoB&#13;
looks forward to WSP-AF to maintain its engagement in RWSS and to extend its support to urban WSS.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The challenge of the MDGs requires an acceleration of the coverage of both&#13;
sanitation and water supply. The GoB is developing a MDG action plan under the framework of the PRSP&#13;
process. The main opportunities for sector engagement and scaling up are:&#13;
    The PRSP constitute the proper framework to prioritize scaling up strategies and opening the way the&#13;
    adoption of programmatic approaches;&#13;
    The acceleration of administrative decentralization which would require a coherent strategy for large&#13;
    scale capacity building and knowledge transfer from central institutions to local governments;&#13;
    The endorsement of the MDGs offers the opportunity to rise the profile the sector, especially for&#13;
    sanitation; and,&#13;
    A growing consensus by sector stakeholders on key sector priority issues will facilitate coordination.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: WSP-AF has been operational in Benin for more than 10 years, mainly in investment&#13;
support for rural water development. Since 2004 WSP-AF has established a country presence to&#13;
strengthen its role in sector support. The focus of WSP support will continue to be on helping Benin:&#13;
    to implement a strategy to reach the MDGs, specifically focusing on the rural water sector,&#13;
    to develop with the other donors an urban WSS strategy,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    to develop and implement a communication action plan for the RWS sector and,&#13;
    to develop and implement a RWS maintenance project pilot.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF plans to consolidate this support through a permanent presence by hiring a representative to be&#13;
hosted by the Benin World Bank office.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has developed a close and consistent partnership with the&#13;
Water and Urban Unit - West Africa (AFTU2), Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Danida), German&#13;
Development Agency (GTZ), and the Belgian Directorate-General for Development Cooperation (DGDC),&#13;
supporting the development of the RWSS sector through its lead ministry and has led the support for Benin's&#13;
sector strategies. WSP-AF's work on WSS in PRSP initiatives and support for programmatic approaches has&#13;
created interest from the GoB and increased demand for WSP-AF support.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Activity Selection: During FY06, WSP-AF will focus its operations in three areas:&#13;
1. assisting the government to strengthen and implement a roadmap for achieving the MDGs;&#13;
2. support developing the supply chains aspects of the RWS strategy;&#13;
3. assisting GoB to develop and implement a communication action plan for the RWS sector; and&#13;
4. support GoB to develop an urban water supply strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Burkina Faso&#13;
The Challenge: Currently 7.2 million (61%) of Burkina Faso's 11.8 million people have access to water,&#13;
and 3.4 million (29%) have access to sanitation. Given the current rate of population growth, to achieve&#13;
the MDG by 2015 and therefore reduce by half the number of people without access to water and&#13;
sanitation services, 5.8 million more people would need to obtain access to water and 7.3 million to&#13;
sanitation for a total of 13.1 million inhabitants. Burkina Faso has a substantial challenge to reach the&#13;
MDG targets, but there is still no formal strategy and action plan for achieving them. While Burkina Faso&#13;
has recently initiated a process of decentralization, systems remain poorly developed and sector capacity&#13;
is extremely weak at the local government level.         Critical challenges are to improve the sanitary&#13;
environment in the main and smaller towns and respond to the new decentralized context for service&#13;
provision.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The government of Burkina Faso initiated a reform process in the sector beginning in&#13;
1990, but needs help in developing coherent plans to meet the MDGs. The World Bank (WB) assisted in&#13;
developing a Country Action Plan (CAP) for the water and sanitation sector. WSP-AF has helped&#13;
develop the WSS MDG strategy and action plan frameworks with the support from a French CTF. WSP-&#13;
AF has also been requested by AFTU2 to support the development of the sanitation component of a new&#13;
investment program under preparation for six small towns, and the government of Burkina Faso requested&#13;
WSP to support the development of a program budget for the WSS sector, especially in the development&#13;
of a financing model and the M&amp;E for the WSS MDG targets. Moreover, WSP-AF is supporting the&#13;
UNDP Capacity Enhancement Program for six urban centers to better plan and allocate budget to poor&#13;
settlements and improve access to water and sanitation towards meeting the MDG goals. UNDP has been&#13;
a consistent financing partner since the beginning to develop strategies, operational plans at the urban&#13;
level, and to achieve sustainable impact on the ground. Other strong in-country partnerships are with&#13;
Denmark, Holland, Sweden, France, and Switzerland.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: WSP-AF has been involved in support of this process from the beginning, collaborating&#13;
closely with UNDP to develop sustainable local mechanisms to finance urban sanitation and build&#13;
capacity. As a focus country, especially with regards to Burkina Faso's achievement of the MDG targets,&#13;
WSP-AF will be increasing the level of support offered with a focus on urban settlements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has had a decade of engagement in activities supporting&#13;
Burkina Faso's authorities, and has experience and credibility in the sector.            WSP-AF pioneered&#13;
participatory development activities and has extended this engagement to a wide variety of areas. The&#13;
collaboration with the government at both central and decentralized level is strong.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Strategic Activity Selection: The following specific activities will be the focus for FY06:&#13;
1. help develop a program budget to meet the WSS MDGs and translate it into decentralized action&#13;
    plans for the selected towns;&#13;
2. help towns and municipalities to develop specific institutional and financial arrangements to serve the&#13;
    poor in urban areas;&#13;
3. help selected municipalities improve their capacity to design, implement, and supervise pro-poor&#13;
    strategy for environmental sanitation improvement; and&#13;
4. support CDD programs implementation under the UNDP project.&#13;
&#13;
Democratic Republic of Congo&#13;
The Challenge: Access to, and quality of WS services have regressed since the early `90s due to lack of&#13;
investment, institutional decay and rising poverty. Although there are no reliable sector data, the PRSP&#13;
estimates of coverage, 26 % for access to safe water and 46% for use of hygienic sanitation, are believed&#13;
to be close to reality. DRC needs in WSS are immense and have to be tackled in a context of systemic&#13;
institutional weakness and lack of support services (enterprises, banking, transport, etc.). Initial steps&#13;
along the arduous path of rehabilitation and development are being taken by humanitarian initiatives and,&#13;
more importantly, by large emergency multi-sectoral rehabilitation programs funded by World Bank&#13;
grants and credits and administered by dedicated project execution agencies. Structural reform of&#13;
REGIDESO, the national urban water utility, is supported by a Bank-funded para-statal reform program.&#13;
The PRSP rates lack of access to safe water among the four prime determinants of poverty and is founded&#13;
on the principles of community empowerment. The PRSP and the related investment program (PMPTR)&#13;
estimate that the WSS/MDGs would call for increasing from 14 to 42 million the number people with&#13;
access to safe water. This would not only require investment in excess of US$ 2 billion but would also&#13;
depend on substantial reforms to increase efficiency and to mobilize and develop additional capacity. The&#13;
medium-term challenge is to foster the transition from emergency to sector programs based on coherent&#13;
strategies. The immediate challenges is: (i) to ensure that the large scale rehabilitation projects now&#13;
getting underway in main cities are accompanied by the institutional and financial measures needed to&#13;
ensure that they actually result in service improvement and expansion; and, (ii) to build sector pilot&#13;
programs to support local initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The recommendations of the Round Table on Infrastructure (Oct. 2004) provide a&#13;
sound starting point to guide the transition to coherent sectoral programs driven by service objectives and&#13;
to initiate sectoral coordination directed not only at investment plans but also at sector policies and&#13;
institutional strategies. While there are no clear perception of how the water sector should be structured&#13;
in the future, there is widespread acceptance of the need to undertake structural reform and to open up the&#13;
sector to a broader range of actors including private operators, CBOs, NGOs, etc.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF engagement in DRC as a new Focus Country: WSP-AF engagement in DRC was initiated by&#13;
the WUP-sponsored seminar on WS sector reform (Oct. 2003) which lead to demand for WSP to facilitate&#13;
the water sector aspects of the Infrastructure Round Table. WSP-AF's medium-term program is based on&#13;
the three lines of actions prioritized by the Round Table: (i) to redress REGIDESO performance and&#13;
launch structural reform of the urban WS sub-sector; (ii) to support local initiatives; and (iii) to strengthen&#13;
sectoral coordination.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF comparative advantage: Through its role in strategy development and learning events at the&#13;
early stages of the drive to resume the development of the WSS sector, WSP-AF has gained the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     13&#13;

Africa                                                                                   FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
confidence of key sector agencies and donors in particular EU, AFD, GTZ/KFW. WSP-AF is seen as a&#13;
vehicle to re-connect DRC sector professionals and institutions with regional and global knowledge&#13;
networks. Finally, in a context where donors are seeking to engage (or re-engage) in the WSS sector,&#13;
WSP-AF is seen as an objective source of strategic advice. The full realization of WSP-AF comparative&#13;
advantage would require the development of a synergic relationship with AFTU2 and its involvement in&#13;
the preparation of the forthcoming utility project (Water and Power).&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF Activity Selection, three-year perspective: WSP-AF program for the next three years will focus&#13;
on four objectives:&#13;
-   support the reform of urban water supply services&#13;
-   help to prepare and implement programs to support local community-based WSS initiatives&#13;
-   help map out the transition to coherent sector development programs aiming at the WSS/MDGs; and&#13;
-   strengthen sectoral coordination and knowledge dissemination and networking.&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopia&#13;
The Challenge: WSS coverage figures for Ethiopia are among the lowest on the continent. 76% do not&#13;
have access to safe and adequate WS. The sanitation coverage both for urban and rural is estimated to be&#13;
around 13% (6% rural and 57% urban). The challenge is to try and rectify this situation in order to meet the&#13;
WSS MDGs within the next 10 years. The population of Ethiopia is projected to reach 95 million by 2015&#13;
and meeting the MDGs would require providing water and sanitation services for an additional 45 and 55&#13;
million people, respectively, between now and 2015. Considering that improvements in the `90s were only&#13;
from 22% to 24% for water supply and negligible for sanitation, the task ahead is extremely daunting. In&#13;
the case of sanitation, the MDG challenge requires clearer role definitions, stronger inter-agency&#13;
coordination, a clear financing policy, and the incorporation of sanitation into investment programs.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The GoE has created favorable conditions to pursue the WSS MDGs. It adopted a&#13;
National Water Resources Management Policy (1998), formulated a National Water Sector Development&#13;
Strategy, issued a public health proclamation (2000), and is in the process of examining a draft&#13;
environmental health policy. Implementation of this policy framework and completion of the sanitation&#13;
policy framework are the major tasks facing the government.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: WSP-AF has strengthened its presence and operations in Ethiopia in recent years and&#13;
has played a leading role in supporting the Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR) in policy and strategy&#13;
development, primarily in water. In this, WSP-AF intends to work closely with the MoWR, the Ministry&#13;
of Health (MoH), the WB, non-governmental agencies (NGOs), donors, and other sector partners and&#13;
stakeholders. WSP-AF intends to shift the focus of its operations to practical support for sanitation in&#13;
Ethiopia but will also continue to strengthen sector coordination, development, and mainstreaming of&#13;
sanitation strategy and guidelines, share knowledge from regional initiatives, and assist Ethiopia in the&#13;
preparation of roadmaps for the regional states in the context of the national MDG goals.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has had a strong presence in Ethiopia and supported the&#13;
WSS sector since mid-`90s, working both in strategy and policy development in water and sanitation.&#13;
WSP-AF's support has been provided through consultation with regional states, federal ministries, NGOs,&#13;
user groups, and other sector institutions resulting in a close working relationship between clients,&#13;
partners, and sector stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Strategic Activity Selection: Working closely with the WB, WSP-AF will work within the&#13;
framework of the WSS MDGs and focus on the following activities.&#13;
· support to finalizing a sanitation strategy and preparation for its implementation&#13;
· preparation of regional MDG roadmaps and financing strategy in the regional states&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Kenya&#13;
The Challenge: The water sector in Kenya is facing enormous challenges. The sector is currently&#13;
undergoing reforms to implement the Water Act 2002 and achieve the MDGs. Nationally, access to safe&#13;
water is currently estimated at 57%, while access to basic sanitation is at 81%. This translates into 13&#13;
million Kenyans without access to water and 5.7 million people without access to basic sanitation. The&#13;
realistic achievement of the MDGs in the field of Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) requires a strong&#13;
financial, technical and conceptual support through (i) an enhanced sector-wide and programme&#13;
approaches and integration of these to ensure greater impact on reducing poverty; (ii) promotion of&#13;
poverty-oriented economic growth, among others through enhanced community-based and private sector&#13;
participation; and (iii) mobilization of additional financial resources.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: To help steer the reforms and guide the implementation of the Water Act 2002, the&#13;
Ministry has established an autonomous Water Sector Reform Secretariat (WSRS) and prepared a three-&#13;
year transition plan. The harmonization of the WSS strategy and WRM has also gone a long way in&#13;
facilitating the process. The new Ministry has signaled its intention to follow through on the reform&#13;
process, including exploring options for private sector participation in the major cities and seeking to&#13;
respond to the new expectations in the country. This creates a good opportunity for scaling up service&#13;
provision and attaining the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: WSP-AF played a key role during the Kenya Water and Sanitation Sector Review 2000,&#13;
and has been closely involved in the development of the new Water Act 2002, the WSS strategy, and the&#13;
WRM strategy. WSP-AF proposes to support the: i) overall coordination process and maintenance of&#13;
dialogue among government, donors, and other sector actors, to facilitate support for the reform process;&#13;
ii) development of appropriate sector institutions, including the restructuring of the Department of Water;&#13;
iii) development of delivery mechanisms for WSS in informal settlements and preparation of&#13;
investment programs; and iv) process for the development and implementation of national&#13;
environmental H&amp;S policy.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF is seen by the MW&amp;I and other stakeholders as an honest&#13;
broker, and is therefore expected to lead sector coordination activities among government, donors, and&#13;
other sector actors. This comparative advantage derives from: i) a strong regional presence; ii)&#13;
experience in similar reform projects in other countries, such as guiding sector reform in Zambia and the&#13;
development of sanitation policies in Burkina Faso, etc.; iii) WSP-AF success in developing delivery&#13;
mechanisms for WSS services to urban poor under WUP; and iv) An in-country presence and good&#13;
understanding of the water and sanitation sector issues in the country.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-AF's work in Kenya will focus on four projects namely: (i)&#13;
Kenya WSS MDG Road Map (ii) Support to WSS Sector Reform Processes (iii) Development of a&#13;
strategy for WSS service provision in Informal Settlements and (iv) Support the preparation and&#13;
implementation of the National Environmental H&amp;S Policy and program.&#13;
&#13;
Mozambique&#13;
The Challenge: Mozambique is one of the 15 poorest countries in the world. National water supply&#13;
coverage is less than 45% for both urban and rural areas, and urban sanitation coverage is less than 50%&#13;
(23% for rural) placing Mozambique as below-average when compared with the rest of Africa. Though&#13;
recent economic growth rates have been favorable, structural weaknesses resulting from a tragic colonial&#13;
past and long periods of post-independence armed conflict have hindered sector development. Despite&#13;
high levels of investment and donor support, sustainable service provision remains elusive, with some&#13;
provinces reporting upwards of 50% of their water points as being non-functional. Reaching the WSS&#13;
MDGs seems unlikely as evidenced by failure to meet national construction targets for the past two years.&#13;

&#13;
The Opportunities: The country is currently struggling to develop and implement policies for sustainable&#13;
rural water supply, and generating appropriate options for its demand-responsive approach-based National&#13;
Water Policy. A significant number of large-scale rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) projects are&#13;
underway throughout Mozambique, making the countryside a living laboratory for generating lessons&#13;
learned and forging productive partnerships. There currently exists a niche for WSP-AF's traditional&#13;
networking and communications role. No other sector agent pursues networking activities in RWSS, or&#13;
can draw upon an international team of experts on a range of issues, as WSP-AF can.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF Role: WSP-AF can play a long-term role in the following areas: (1) supporting achievement of&#13;
Mozambique's WSS MDGs, (2) documenting RWSS lessons learned, (3) improving sector networking&#13;
and communications, and (4) increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of RWSS investments.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF is a highly-experienced, honest broker with a permanent in-&#13;
country presence. This instills policy makers with the confidence to engage in open dialogue, leading to&#13;
meaningful reform and eventually to increased service access to the poor.&#13;
&#13;
WSP's Strategic Activity Selection: (1) Building Capacity to Reach the MDGs: (a) MDG Roadmap&#13;
Support. WSP-AF, at the request of the Mozambican government, and acting in concert with CEDESA&#13;
(Mozambique's new Strategic Studies Center for Water), will accompany the GoM and other partners&#13;
(including UNICEF, the European Union, and the Dutch Embassy) in a comprehensive initiative aimed at&#13;
producing Mozambique's MDG Roadmap. (b) Millennium Room. As part of MDG roadmap follow-up,&#13;
CEDESA plans to establish an information management desk where sector information will be collected,&#13;
freely accessed, and analyzed. Development of a performance management system in the National&#13;
Directorate for Water over the coming years will provide the foundation for the Millennium Room.&#13;
&#13;
(2) Supporting Decentralized Service Delivery: (a) Documenting RWSS Lessons Learned. WSP-AF, at&#13;
the request of the Mozambican government, and acting in concert with CEDESA, proposes to assist in the&#13;
documentation of lessons learned under the larger ongoing RWSS projects throughout the country,&#13;
including the Inhambane National Pilot Project, and other donor-assisted projects. (b) Decentralized&#13;
Business Approaches. As more and more of the country's investment budget gets channeled to local&#13;
agents, the need grows for improved service delivery mechanisms and approaches. WSP-AF will support&#13;
CEDESA in clarifying decentralized public roles and structures, as well as identifying and testing new&#13;
decentralized service delivery business models.&#13;
&#13;
(3) Networking and Communications: (a) WSS Working Group. Under the initiative of WSP-AF, the&#13;
Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), and UNICEF, the WSS Working Group resumed deliberations&#13;
in 2003, uniting over 12 national and international institutions, and improving intra-sector dialogue and&#13;
networking. WSP-AF plans to add to this mix with a bi-monthly special event on a subject of interest&#13;
within the sector, in close collaboration with CEDESA. (b) Communications. As an integral part of all&#13;
activities launched by WSP-AF and its partners, the Maputo hub will require the implementation of its&#13;
communications plan, whose aim is to keep donors, clients, partners, WSP-AF, and Bank management&#13;
abreast of issues, results, and impacts achieved through WSP-supported projects.&#13;
&#13;
Rwanda&#13;
The Challenge: In Rwanda, less than 5% of rural households have access to safe water. The lack of&#13;
hygiene awareness and the poor conditions of traditional latrines, which equip more than 80% of houses,&#13;
contribute to high prevalence of diarrheal and skin disease. Rwanda has established a sound policy&#13;
framework for sector development and has mobilized considerable donor support for WSS development&#13;
in particular through the PRSP process. Its main challenges in reaching the MDGs lay in overcoming the&#13;
gap in program implementation and in building up capacity at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Africa                                                                                 FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Demand-responsive approach-based project rules and procedures under the country&#13;
decentralization policy are being tested under an International Development Association (IDA)-funded&#13;
RWSS project. The drive for hygiene promotion and education will need more effective methods and a&#13;
higher degree of institutional collaboration among the agencies concerned. Under the AfDB-sponsored&#13;
RWSS Initiative, Rwanda has developed a comprehensive long-term program (PNEAR) to reach 100%&#13;
coverage in water supply and sanitation by 2020 which would encompass the MDGs. The PNEAR would&#13;
unfold in four-year phases. The launch phase is just getting underway and will lead to the creation of a&#13;
specialized agency to support rural WSS development.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: WSP-AF was active in Rwanda from 1997 to 2001. WSP-AF initially focused on&#13;
helping to develop and disseminate the sector policy and to prepare the IDA-funded RWSS project. Later&#13;
WSP-AF support extended to the treatment of WSS development in the PRSP process, to urban sanitation&#13;
issues and to hygiene promotion and school sanitation in partnership with UNICEF. The relationship was&#13;
interrupted following the departure of WSP-AF staff in Rwanda.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has developed a close and consistent partnership with&#13;
AFTU2 and DGDC, supporting the development of the RWSS sector. Prompted by client and donor&#13;
requests, WSP-AF is now planning to resume its engagement in Rwanda. WSP-AF areas of engagement&#13;
will have to be defined through consultations with lead sector agencies and key partners (in particular&#13;
AfDB, EC, DGDC and UNICEF).&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Activity Selection:&#13;
MDG Roadmap and sector policies. WSP-AF support under the framework of the long-term PNEAR&#13;
could focus on the following:&#13;
· Support for the update of the 1998 WSS sector policy including the lessons emerging from the&#13;
    implementation of the IDA-funded RWSS project, cost recovery potential, and Operations and&#13;
    Maintenance (O&amp;M) capacity.&#13;
· Institutional options for the management of so-called complex WSS systems&#13;
· Review of flows of funds and funding mechanisms for investments under decentralization&#13;
· Help in bringing the regional experience to bear on the design of the proposed new sector agency&#13;
· Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) systems&#13;
Hygiene and Sanitation. WSP-AF support would draw on its experience in Uganda and Ethiopia to:&#13;
-   help develop the sanitation strategy and the roadmap for the sanitation MDG,&#13;
-   review implementation guidelines for the sanitation and hygiene components of WSS programs&#13;
    including: (i) latrines for public facilities; and, (ii) innovative approaches for the promotion of&#13;
    improvements in household sanitation: i.e. social marketing, ECOSAN etc.&#13;
Sector coordination and knowledge sharing and networking involving key donors and support to country-&#13;
based network linking sector actors.&#13;
&#13;
Senegal&#13;
The Challenge: Senegal embarked upon a reform of its urban water and sanitation institutions in 1995,&#13;
and is now operating within a new water law which transformed the institutional framework for the&#13;
sector. Reform of its urban water supply service, based on private-sector participation (PSP) with a ten-&#13;
year lease contract to Sénégalaise des Eaux made in 1996. As the lease contract is coming to an end and a&#13;
second generation of reform is already under discussion, the WSS sector needs support to evaluate,&#13;
monitor and strengthen the PPP in the WSS sector and related negotiations. In RWS, the government has&#13;
previously financed technically-sophisticated water systems, but the ongoing reforms (including new&#13;
financing criteria and the implementation of cost-recovery policies) are modifying the conditions in the&#13;
management of the RWS systems. WSP-AF's support is requested to revise the maintenance policy and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Africa                                                                                   FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
advise on PSP options to enhance efficiency and sustainability. The government initiated the development&#13;
of a weak urban sanitation strategy in 1996 and created a National Office of Sanitation Agency (ONAS).&#13;
Still service coverage, in particular for sanitation, remains low. The GoS has requested WSP-AF support&#13;
to develop a nation wide strategy and policy for sanitation&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: In the framework of the ongoing Senegal Long Term Water Sector Project the&#13;
government has requested the support of the WB and WSP-AF to help the PRSP process better reflect the&#13;
rural water and sanitation sub-sectors in order to assist Senegal in reaching the WSS MDGs. The leasing&#13;
contract is coming to an end and a second generation of reform is already under discussion and will focus&#13;
on RWSS. This assistance will involve reviewing the RWS sector under the overall framework of the&#13;
MDG target for a better understanding of success factors related to financing mechanisms, institutional&#13;
arrangements, increased PSP, and sustainable technological options including supply chains for RWS&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: In previous years, WSP-AF has supported activities in Senegal through its regional thematic&#13;
operations.    An expanded program was developed in Senegal to respond to additional requests from&#13;
government and the WB. WSP-AF is perceived as an agency that can assist to building momentum in one&#13;
previously neglected, but critical area to Senegal's attainment of the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: With a significant regional presence in Dakar, WSP-AF is well&#13;
positioned to support the country in on going reforms. Significant experience in rural water policy&#13;
development and a comprehensive engagement with sector ministries in the country, in the RWSS sub&#13;
sector, further give leverage to initiatives led by WSP-AF.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-AF support to Senegal for the coming years will mainly&#13;
focus on assisting the country to improve its WSS policy and strategy to meet the MDG targets. During&#13;
FY06, WSP-AF will focus its support in four areas:&#13;
· strengthen the PPP in the WSS sector and related negotiations;&#13;
· revise the maintenance policy and advise on PSP options;&#13;
· develop a nation wide strategy and policy for sanitation;&#13;
· the WSS communication team building.&#13;
&#13;
Uganda&#13;
The Challenge: Realizing that its earlier targets of achieving sustainable safe water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities within easy reach of 100% of its population by 2015 (current coverage is just under 60%) were&#13;
very ambitious and unattainable, Uganda recently revised its Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) and&#13;
Sector Investment Plan (SIP) targets to 77% and 80% for safe water supply and sanitation, respectively.&#13;
However, with a high population growth of 3.4%, it is still likely that unless concerted efforts are made to&#13;
ensure sustainable and increased coverage, increase in facilities is likely to be countered by population&#13;
rise making the lowered targets still unattainable. The SIP and SWAp are very supportive of the water&#13;
sub-sector and while challenges exist, meeting water MDG and PEAP targets is closely addressed. The&#13;
situation is worse for sanitation, which falls under 3 different sectors with many other priorities.&#13;
Sanitation issues include financial constraints, insufficient human resource capacity - both within districts&#13;
(to plan and implement sector activities) and at the center (to offer policy and technical guidance to&#13;
districts and other service providers), poor operation and maintenance of WSS facilities, and inadequate&#13;
capacity of the Environmental Health Division (EHD- lead agency for sanitation development in Uganda)&#13;
of the Ministry of Health (MoH) to deliver its strategic priorities of sanitation and hygiene promotion, as&#13;
well as effective planning support to districts. Other priority concerns were highlighted in the Joint&#13;
Sector Review undertakings of 2003 and 2004 for both the water and health sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Africa                                                                                   FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Some of the opportunities for overcoming the challenges above include: political&#13;
willingness and commitment of sector actors in Uganda for reform, the Sector-Wide Approach to&#13;
Planning (SWAP) framework that enables coordinated planning, Poverty Reduction Support Credit&#13;
(PRSC) instrument by the World Bank, joint funding by Danida, Sida, DFID (and Austrian Cooperation)&#13;
for coordinated planning and funding, as well as the annual joint GoU/Donors sector reviews to assess&#13;
performance and set undertakings for improvement. Specifically for sanitation, the DFID-funded/WSP-&#13;
AF-managed capacity building program for EHD and the sanitation working group have facilitated&#13;
increased profile for sanitation. At the policy level, improved sanitation and hygiene have been&#13;
highlighted as priorities under the recently revised national PEAP and the Health Sector Strategic Plan&#13;
(HSSP II).&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: The GoU is proactively driving the development process in the sector and its model is&#13;
critical for developments elsewhere. While many development partners provide technical assistance at&#13;
national level, WSP-AF's role will continue to be, in addition to providing knowledge, assisting the GoU&#13;
in the implementation of activities to meet its sector MDGs with focus on the sanitation sub-sector that&#13;
currently faces bigger challenges.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: Uganda is a WSP-AF focus country with a current resident staff of&#13;
two. WSP-AF's strong relationship with the GoU, DPs, and NGOs and its current support program to&#13;
EHD places it favorably to facilitate and stimulate policy dialogue and national coordination among the&#13;
sanitation sub-sector players, and to support development of an enabling framework under the DFID-&#13;
funded capacity building project. Furthermore, WSP-AF's regional learning experiences with sanitation,&#13;
serving the urban poor, scaling up approaches, and creating management models for WSS O&amp;M in small&#13;
towns can add value to the sector in Uganda.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Strategic Activity Selection: Country Themes&#13;
· Sanitation: WSP-AF will continue supporting the GoU (EHD) to be more responsive to the&#13;
     challenges in the sanitation sub-sector since the present situation is far from acceptable for this&#13;
     national priority. WSP-AF's existing regional sanitation capacity will enhance the support given in&#13;
     Uganda. WSP-AF is a strong member of the Sanitation Sub-sector Working Group. WSP-AF will&#13;
     support the enabling environment for sanitation and hygiene promotion and also support the&#13;
     development and implementation of the sanitation MDG roadmap.&#13;
· Rural and Small Towns: Due to past activities and demand by sector partners and clients for this&#13;
     specific support, WSP-AF will support the development of a strategy for planning and management of&#13;
     sanitation services in small towns, incorporating the use of small-scale private operators (in collaboration&#13;
     with WASTE of the Netherlands and other nationals partners). Documentation of emerging experiences&#13;
     in using private operators in water supply will be a key focus activity.&#13;
&#13;
Yemen1&#13;
The Challenge: Yemen is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. Competing uses of&#13;
water, declining groundwater levels and lack of functional institutional and policy frameworks limit&#13;
sector development. Less than 40% of Yemen's rural population has access to potable water and less than&#13;
20% to safe sanitation services (75% of the 19.5 million people live in rural areas). These statistics mask&#13;
a dimmer reality, particularly in southern rural areas where access to rural potable water is as low as 20%,&#13;
and where as few as 15% have access to sanitation. The poor WSS situation is a contributory factor to&#13;
Yemen's high under-5 rural child mortality rate (120 to 150 per 1,000 live births).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1Note: current WSP- Yemen program funding is scheduled to end in mid-September 2005. The proposed strategy&#13;
activities are founded on identifying donor funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Africa                                                                                    FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During 2004 the GoY articulated its development ambitions for WSS, resource management and&#13;
environment sectors in the National Water Sector Strategic Investment Plan (NWSSIP). While NWSSIP&#13;
embraces a far-reaching agenda, it remains clear that translating the proposed strategies into forward-&#13;
moving action will require great political commitment, vast resources and dedicated reform programs for&#13;
the relevant sub-sectors. Both the National RWSS Policy­Strategy, (formulated during 2004) and NWSSIP&#13;
derive their momentum from the GoY's commitment to achieving the WSS MDGs. However, the starting&#13;
point for MDG advancement is substantially low, though there is cause for hope. Decentralized service&#13;
development is underway, highlighting a separation between implementation and regulatory / custodial&#13;
functions, community-based approaches are gradually becoming the standard, inter-sectoral coordination is&#13;
improving and RWSS public sector reform is high on the agenda.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: In RWSS, the GoY­WB's ongoing RWSS project has completed a process of testing&#13;
new approaches to improve the sustainability of RWSS systems. This effort provided the platform for&#13;
development of both the National RWSS Policy-Strategy and the rural component of the NWSSIP. These&#13;
are, however, roadmap documents which serve to outline best practice approaches against a backdrop of&#13;
limited sectoral capacity, lethargic and weak institutions, diminishing water resources, and a rapidly&#13;
expanding population. Overtly water supply is the priority component of rural services development, while&#13;
S&amp;H education is not afforded the just attention they require given dismal health standards.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: WSP-AF can play a substantial long-term role in assisting the government in&#13;
implementing RWSS policy and sub-sector reform.            Rural sanitation policy development, hygiene&#13;
promotion /education, and commensurate communications strategies are vital elements to which WSP-AF&#13;
can bring its considerable knowledge and global experience.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF is an experienced broker in water supply and sanitation&#13;
policy development, with an in-country presence. Close working relationships with the WB and country-&#13;
based donors (the Netherlands is the largest RWSS external support agencies ­ ESA ­ in Yemen)&#13;
strengthen WSP's position in sector policy development and reform.&#13;
&#13;
WSP's Activity Selection: WSP-AF's technical assistance will focus on four main areas:&#13;
· Support rural sanitation policy development and action implementation planning&#13;
· Design and assist implementation of hygiene education programs&#13;
· Support RWSS communications strategy development and coordination of RWSS activities Yemen&#13;
· Support the establishment of a dedicated RWSS Sub-Sector Reform Office/Program&#13;
&#13;
Zambia&#13;
The Challenge: Since 1993, the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) has been undertaking&#13;
institutional reforms of the water and sanitation sector, resulting in formation of commercial utilities in&#13;
the urban areas, and ongoing attempts to strengthen WSS functions within the local authorities in the rural&#13;
areas. Despite these efforts, access to water and sanitation is still very low with national coverage of 53%&#13;
for water and 23% for sanitation. Major constraints include: inadequate institutional and financial&#13;
capacity in both the local authorities as well as in the commercial utilities; lack of clarity in the&#13;
institutional and legislative arrangement; existence of several funding routes and mechanisms often with&#13;
conflicting rules; and inadequate coordination amongst different donors, resulting in duplication of effort&#13;
and aid ineffectiveness in the sector. These issues need to be resolved if Zambia is to meet the MDGs in&#13;
the next 10 years.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: There are a number of opportunities for overcoming these problems. Zambia has a&#13;
progressive legal and policy framework contained in the National Water Policy (1994), the Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Act (1997), and the Decentralisation Policy (2002). These, among others, provide for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Africa                                                                                 FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
participation of different service providers, commercial viability and sustainability of WSS, as well as&#13;
specific focus on un-served and poor communities. The GRZ has also committed to developing an&#13;
appropriate and effective institutional framework, including the recent adoption in November 2004 of a&#13;
new RWSS institutional framework, targeted at devolving and strengthening WSS functions in local&#13;
authorities. Furthermore, the GRZ has created the Water Sector Advisory Group (Water SAG- all donors&#13;
including WSP-AF are represented on the SAG by DANIDA), and the MDG Technical Committee, to&#13;
spearhead the MDG process, strengthen WSS issues in the PRSP process and lead the coordination of the&#13;
sector, including development of a sector wide approach (SWAp) to planning in the sector. The numerous&#13;
donors and ESAs are also keen to participate in the MDG process, and have established bi-monthly donor&#13;
meetings to facilitate better sector coordination and collaboration. All these factors create favorable&#13;
conditions to pursue the WSS MDGs. However, the implementation of these policy measures, and&#13;
developing a strategic plan for the achievement of the MDGs, still constitute major tasks for the&#13;
government. In particular, the GRZ needs support with coordinating the activities of all sector players if&#13;
they are to develop a country owned and viable Roadmap. In particular, rolling out the new RWSS&#13;
institutional framework requires a lot of support if the MDGs are to be achieved, as these are the areas&#13;
with the biggest WSS problem.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: While many development partners are willing to provide investment funds, WSP-AF's&#13;
role in Zambia will focus on assisting the government to facilitate processes that will support national&#13;
dialogue on the MDG and SWAp agenda, and in so doing strengthen sector coordination and MLGH&#13;
leadership in WSS. WSP-AF will also play a major role in facilitating preparatory activities critical to the&#13;
implementation of the new RWSS institutional framework.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: Although Zambia is only now becoming a WSP focus country,&#13;
WSP-AF has been operating here for several years, and has developed strong relationships with the&#13;
Government of Zambia, support agencies including DCI, DANIDA, and NGOs like Care International&#13;
and WaterAid. WSP-AF currently has one resident staff. WSP-AF's regional learning experiences with&#13;
MDG roadmapping, and institutional reforms, can add value to the sector in Zambia, particularly by&#13;
maximizing its position as a non-donor, to stimulate and facilitate sector coordination, while also&#13;
informing the MDG process with lessons on innovative approaches for water and sanitation delivery.&#13;
With the specific case of RWSS, WSP-AF has been involved with the development of the new RWSS&#13;
framework, and has been asked by GRZ, and been provided with financial resources by DCI to assist with&#13;
the rolling out of this new framework.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-AF will focus on those areas where it can add the most&#13;
value to what both the GRZ and ESAs are doing. Specifically, WSP-AF will support a national policy&#13;
dialogue that should lead to the development of a Zambian owned MDG roadmap, together with relevant&#13;
implementation strategies. Based on the request from GRZ, WSP-AF will also support the development&#13;
of tools and systems critical to the implementation of the new RWSS framework.&#13;
&#13;
Communications&#13;
The Challenge: Achieving the MDGs in Africa requires a significant increase in the quantity and quality&#13;
of communications. There has been insufficient attention to developing the support of policy and&#13;
decision-makers who drive the policy and practice changes that increase access to WSS. The main&#13;
challenge relates to the fact that although communications plays a critical role in the reform processes&#13;
towards meeting the WSS MDGs, in most instances it is not being used strategically. Country clients&#13;
need to be able to communicate with a range of stakeholders more effectively because reform processes&#13;
tend to be complex, controversial, involve political risk, and require social change.            Strategic,&#13;
professionally-managed information, advocacy, and behavior change programs can significantly increase&#13;
the impact of technical and reform projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Africa                                                                                FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Thus far, most government and development agencies in Africa do not have sufficient communications&#13;
capacity for this challenge. There is a need for improved policy dialogue, reform advocacy (with a pro-&#13;
poor focus), sector co-ordination, strategic reform communication (at national and utility levels), public&#13;
participation, consumer voice and behavior-change programs (including S&amp;H promotion).&#13;
&#13;
As a respected knowledge and advocacy agency, it is critical that WSP-AF's dissemination tools and&#13;
processes are of the highest quality, and this requires ongoing effort. On a regional level, there is&#13;
currently an insufficient effort to improve decision-makers knowledge of, engagement with, and support&#13;
for addressing the MDG challenge. More needs to be done to maximize the MDG advocacy potential&#13;
related to regional initiatives and processes such as AMCOW, AMIWASH, AfricaSan, and national&#13;
initiatives in all WSP-AF focus countries.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: In this context, there has been growing expressed client demand for technical&#13;
assistance at the country level to improve lead agencies' poor communications capacity. This is a major&#13;
opportunity for WSP-AF to establish a new line of business in building capacity for strategic reform&#13;
communication and MDG advocacy. There is also an opportunity to review and improve the production&#13;
process and dissemination channels for WSP-AF's knowledge and advocacy tools.               A series of&#13;
quality/process improvement systems and a global communication strategy were developed at WSP head&#13;
office in 2004. These are being adapted for conditions in the Africa region and implementation has&#13;
started, but this process needs more dedicated attention.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF Role: WSP-AF plans to provide support to country clients who need to build their own and&#13;
partners' capacity to meet a range of reform and advocacy communication needs. In addition, the&#13;
communication function needs to continue to support internal WSP-AF clients with the communication&#13;
aspects of their programs, and to produce and disseminate a range of knowledge and advocacy tools.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has a respected track record in WSS reform, advocacy, and&#13;
knowledge sharing experience. It has specialists who have been conducting pioneering work in this field,&#13;
and maintains strong relationships with key development communication professionals within WSS&#13;
sector institution.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF Strategic Activity Selection:&#13;
1) Improved production, dissemination, and evaluation of knowledge and advocacy tools. Including:&#13;
managing production of all publications and other multi-media tools; provide inputs to global products&#13;
(e.g. ACCESS, website, annual report); French translation of ACCESS; evaluating the effectiveness of&#13;
WSP-AF's communication tools; better use of dissemination channels; new WSP-AF brochure and&#13;
mobile banners (multi- languages) and support to regional MDG advocacy events and programs.&#13;
&#13;
2) Strengthening country client capacity for strategic reform communication and MDG advocacy.&#13;
Including assisting key clients with communication interventions that are related to engaging domestic&#13;
private sector (range of aspects such as SSIP interface, consumer voice, sanitation marketing and&#13;
customer service development); assisting with development and implementation of national and utility&#13;
reform communication strategies and a capacity-building workshop for client communication staff.&#13;
&#13;
Finance&#13;
The Challenge: Financing is often portrayed as a key challenge in meeting the MDGs for water supply&#13;
and sanitation.     Conventionally, however, finance is viewed as determining sources of funds for&#13;
infrastructure investments and many global estimates of finance requirements for the sustainable&#13;
expansion of water and sanitation coverage point to large funding gaps in public resources. In reality,&#13;
however, the financing challenge goes beyond simply finding more public and aid resources to using the&#13;
resources more effectively and to leveraging more local sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Africa                                                                                     FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The main opportunities for supporting this new outlook on financing in Africa are:&#13;
    The PRSP process offers an opportunity to develop and finance coherent sector programs and&#13;
    accelerate implementation of the ongoing institutional and governance reforms in the sector&#13;
    The need to use the limited public and aid resources through smarter subsidies that are better targeted&#13;
    and help crowd in additional local resources&#13;
    "Internal generation" of resources is common across countries though efforts are needed for greater&#13;
    contribution to capital expenditure and improve sustainability&#13;
    Most countries require assistance developing WSS sector investment and financing strategies to&#13;
    support country owned MDG road maps&#13;
    A move towards programmatic approaches has generated the need to strengthen sector information&#13;
    and M&amp;E systems&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: WSP-AF has over the past 3 years developed an understanding of sector finance&#13;
through a series of in-country sector finance and resource flows studies followed by demand-based&#13;
assistance for investment and financing strategies in Kenya and Uganda. Particular attention has been&#13;
paid to sanitation finance. A global review of financial mechanisms as well as a number of regional&#13;
syntheses has also been developed. During FY06, the focus will be on assisting the focus countries in&#13;
development of financing strategies as a part of their MDG road maps as well as explore new&#13;
opportunities for leveraging local resources and strengthening sector information and M&amp;E systems.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF, through its country assistance and knowledge&#13;
management, has developed a set of products and tools which can be adapted for use in different countries&#13;
in the region. Its strong country presence in over eight focus countries also provides an opportunity to&#13;
integrate development of financing strategies as a part of the country level plans and MDG road maps. In&#13;
addition, WSP-AF's work on WSS in PRSP initiatives has also created demand from several countries.&#13;
WSP-AF has taken a lead in new and diverse areas that are critical for improved sector financing such as:&#13;
leveraging market-based resources through micro-finance, supporting a road show for developing pilots&#13;
for output based aid and strengthening the use of new planning and M&amp;E tools such as public expenditure&#13;
reviews, SWIFT and public expenditure tracking surveys. In carrying out these various activities WSP-&#13;
AF has developed links with a number of regional and global partners including: AFTU1/2, EWD anchor,&#13;
Public Expenditure Thematic Group, GPOBA, EUWI, WaterAid and domestic finance institutions.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Activity Selection: During FY06, WSP-AF will focus its operations in three areas:&#13;
1. Strengthening WSS in PRSPs in Africa: through the next round of benchmarking of ongoing country&#13;
    level processes for WSS in PRSPs, and supporting WSS advocacy at national and local levels&#13;
2. WSS sector finance and resource flows: by direct country assistance in developing sector financing&#13;
    strategies and knowledge management through regional synthesis and development of guidelines and&#13;
    tools (on sector finance, strategies and monitoring) for use in countries&#13;
3. Leveraging market-based resources: through continued support for small water supply projects in&#13;
    Kenya and drawing lessons for other countries as well as exploring borrowing for credit-worthy&#13;
    utilities.&#13;
&#13;
Rural&#13;
The Challenge: Two out of every three Africans live in rural areas. Less than half of the rural population&#13;
has access to improved water supply and less than a third have access to adequate sanitation facilities. Of&#13;
the total number of unserved on the continent, 85% of those using unimproved sources, and 75% without&#13;
access to appropriate sanitation live in rural areas. Even those currently with access to water live with&#13;
water insecurity ­ their improved water sources either dry up for parts of the year, or their pumps, wells,&#13;
boreholes and other works, fail. At any given time an estimated 30% of all rural water points are non-&#13;
functioning, for social, technical, financial, or institutional reasons. The fact that 75% of the world's poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Africa                                                                                    FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
live in rural areas, combined with rural area's lack of infrastructure, communication facilities, commercial&#13;
networks, responsive and representative governments, and employment and educational opportunities,&#13;
makes it especially difficult to improve the rate of delivery of sustainable water and sanitation services.&#13;
However, if the MDGs are to be met, they can only be met by addressing these RWSS challenges.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: African governments have long recognized the special needs and circumstances of&#13;
rural people, and in large part have already accepted the concepts of cost recovery, local implementation&#13;
and management, private sector participation, and demand-responsive approaches, among other key&#13;
policy developments over the past decades. The push to decentralize has also led many governments to&#13;
begin questioning their rural service delivery models, and look for new ways to increase the rate of&#13;
investment while reducing the percentage of non-functioning systems. The RWSN, alongside a number&#13;
of dedicated donor agencies and international organizations, are stimulating debate and sharing lessons,&#13;
while enlisting national governments and other implementers to begin working together to solve the rural&#13;
service provision conundrum.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF Role: WSP-AF plans to deliver its regional rural products under the RWSN banner, taking an&#13;
active role in the three main RWSN flagship activities, namely, (i) self-supply, (ii) sustainable&#13;
handpumps, and (iii) cost-effective boreholes. WSP-AF has been instrumental in the development of the&#13;
strategies and workplans for each theme, and is taking a lead role in managing partial workplan execution,&#13;
including dissemination efforts and the formation of communities of practice.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF is an organization with significant experience in policy&#13;
development and reform, and close ties to national governments, regional bodies, and pan-African&#13;
initiatives, all of which have an instrumental role to play in improving rural service delivery. The fact&#13;
that WSP-AF does not finance infrastructure instills policy makers with the confidence to engage in&#13;
honest dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
WSP's Strategic Activity Selection: (1) RWSN Support: WSP-AF, together with strategic partners&#13;
including national governments, SKAT, WaterAid, IRC, Cranfield University, UNICEF, Loughborough&#13;
University, private sector entrepreneurs, and other partners, will implement the three RWSN flagship&#13;
strategies, by either financing flagship coordinators, working groups, or planned activities and events.&#13;
(2) Drilling Entrepreneur Support Initiative: In coordination with RWSN's "Cost-Effective Boreholes"&#13;
flagship, and as part of the WSP-DfID collaboration on "Unlocking the Potential of the Domestic Private&#13;
Sector", private sector drilling firms will be supported in several countries in order to increase their&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness, while reducing the cost of individual boreholes. (3) FRUGAL: Also as part&#13;
of the WSP-DfID collaboration on "Unlocking the Potential of the Domestic Private Sector", WSP-AF, in&#13;
collaboration with several national governments, the World Bank, and other key stakeholders, plans to&#13;
develop an alternative rural water supply management model called FRUGAL (Forming Rural Utility&#13;
Groups and Leases). FRUGAL is designed to increase the rate of service provision to rural populations,&#13;
while increasing the level of service sustainability, through rural service area agglomeration.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation&#13;
The Challenge: To reach the sanitation MDG in Africa, the rate of sanitation provision would have to&#13;
increase by 70% just to keep pace with population growth; such a dramatic increase in service provision&#13;
would still leave the absolute number without access the same. Achieving the sanitation MDG target will&#13;
require sharp and continuous efforts in investments. Sanitation matters mostly in high-density areas&#13;
where people cannot avoid unmanaged human wastes.              The rapid growth of unplanned peri-urban&#13;
communities thus represents a daunting challenge for sanitation. The problem is not restricted to large&#13;
cities; small towns can have many of the same problems, but without the technical, institutional, and&#13;
legislative capacity that are frequently found in larger cities. The sanitation sector is characterized by&#13;
institutional fragmentation. It is not uncommon to have sanitation responsibilities split between several&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Africa                                                                                     FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ministries. Not only does this makes sector policy difficult to coordinate and manage, but it also means&#13;
that sanitation is low on the individual agenda of each ministry.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: In most African countries, Small Scale Independent Providers (SSIPs) are providing&#13;
the bulk of sanitation services and products. They are flexible to adapt products and services to the needs&#13;
and the capacity to pay of the poor segment of the population. They learn from the market and respond to&#13;
the demand. Even, the enabling environment (lack of recognition, limited access to finance, absence of&#13;
institutional support) for SSIPs intervention, the market offers an opportunity to accelerate sanitation&#13;
services and products delivery towards meeting the sanitation MDG target.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's role: WSP-AF has gained tremendous knowledge on key strategic subjects (i) sanitation&#13;
marketing, (ii) sanitation demand and as a business, (iii) sanitation decentralization, (iv) hygiene&#13;
promotion, and (v) Ecological Sanitation (EcoSan). It has developed a sanitation marketing framework&#13;
that will be roll-out at scale to help clients accelerate sanitation services and infrastructures delivery and&#13;
learn from action. It will further develop its knowledge resources base on sanitation, by analyzing the&#13;
economic and financial aspects of EcoSan and developing sanitation advocacy materials. Finally, it will&#13;
enhance capacity of decision-makers and practitioners through the AfricaSan network.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF comparative advantage&#13;
· Field presence in several countries.&#13;
· Availability of knowledge resources base on sanitation promotion and support partners&#13;
· Partnership with the World Bank on sanitation components of the major water project, with the&#13;
    opportunity to test ideas at substantial scale&#13;
· Extensive experience in regional, national, and global networking and the organization of&#13;
    conferences, workshops, etc&#13;
· Strong tradition of fostering policy debate, through highlighting new issues and approaches&#13;
· Access to leaders and decision-makers in water and sanitation in a large number of countries&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF strategic activity selection: The strategic activities include (i) rolling out of sanitation marketing&#13;
programs, (ii) developing and implementation of advocacy materials, (iii) studying the economic and&#13;
financial aspects of EcoSan, (iv) AfricaSan networking strategy and program, and (iv) global learning&#13;
workshop on sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Urban&#13;
The Challenge: By 2015, urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa will have increased from 32% (2004) to&#13;
about 45%. The urban population will have grown from the current level of about 215 million to about&#13;
400 million. If current trends prevail, the large majority of this population will be living in poverty in&#13;
unplanned or informal settlements without access to safe water and hygienic sanitation. However,&#13;
existing water services in many African cities and towns are characterized by intermittent supplies,&#13;
frequent breakdowns, inefficient operations, poor maintenance, and depleted finance.                  Political&#13;
interference and low tariffs have led to inefficiency and chronic financial weakness of public utilities.&#13;
The inability of WSS utilities to maintain and extend services has typically led to situations where&#13;
subsidies assist those privileged to have a network connection, while most of the poor have to rely on&#13;
more costly and lower quality alternatives.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Role: The regional strategy provides a framework for action in urban areas in order to stimulate&#13;
progress in client countries to meet the relevant water, sanitation and urban settlement MDGs. WSP-AF&#13;
has undertaken a range of learning activities in urban service delivery in recent years which provide a strong&#13;
foundation for action. Central among these is the message that the urban poor will only be properly served&#13;
through efficient, financially viable utilities that establish working relationships with private and civil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      25&#13;

Africa                                                                                     FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
society stakeholders that are able and willing to assist in a process of outreach to poor households and areas.&#13;
The strategy developed for the period 2005-7 proposes that this key experience be taken forward into action&#13;
by executing practical and viable initiatives known to make a difference in a number of selected countries.&#13;
&#13;
The primary objective of the urban strategy is to bring about sustainable improvement in water and&#13;
sanitation service delivery to the African urban poor at the scale and rate required to meet the MDGs. It&#13;
is articulated through four platforms of action which collectively work towards making utility reform pro-&#13;
poor, improving accountability and scaling up service delivery to the poor:&#13;
1. utility / local government platform which will facilitate support to the agencies responsible for the&#13;
    delivery of water and sanitation services (be they public or private utilities or municipal departments)&#13;
    and especially stimulate better understanding and engagement with the local private sector.&#13;
2. national platform which will facilitate a programmatic approach to be adopted by national&#13;
    governments, and will ensure the development of the encouraging environment s and institutional&#13;
    support mechanisms needed to bring about widespread improvement across all urban centers.&#13;
3. consumer platform which will engage with citizens/clients and civil society organizations to&#13;
    enhance communication between utilities and consumers and develop advocacy tools for the urban&#13;
    poor in support of utility reform and improved accountability.&#13;
4. partnership platform which will enable WSP-AF to draw out and optimize the funding resources of&#13;
    a range of other agencies work in urban areas, particularly those with a broader mandate that require&#13;
    specific support for water and sanitation.&#13;
The five urban projects are related to each platform, and strongly linked with the countries' needs. The&#13;
criteria for selecting countries include potential for investment in the sector, ongoing national reform&#13;
processes and identified entry points. Countries include Benin, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania,&#13;
Uganda, and Zambia.       It is anticipated the DRC will be added in collaboration with the fragile&#13;
environments work during FY06.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's Comparative Advantage: WSP's long and increasing experience in Africa means that it has&#13;
been well placed to take up the urban banner and support the efforts of others in getting the urban poor&#13;
noticed. This now needs to be expanded and WSP-AF's voice needs to be raised and efforts to leverage&#13;
widespread action developed. WSP-AF works successfully in support of institutions, as an advocate for&#13;
better services for the poor, and as an agency that can influence the content and scope of large sector&#13;
investments.&#13;

                                         EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: In East Asia and the Pacific, the WSS challenge is to bring about greater commitment to&#13;
and capacity for sector reform to create the institutional framework and capacity necessary to achieve the&#13;
Millennium Development Goals. The region is broadly on track to meet the overall poverty reduction&#13;
goal, but there are wide disparities among countries of their likelihood of reaching specific goals. In the&#13;
water and sanitation sector, countries of the Mekong Region (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam), and&#13;
Indonesia are unlikely to achieve the water and sanitation targets in current circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
While government and donor efforts have resulted in gradual improvements in the general state of the&#13;
sector and sector policy throughout the region, it is clear that both governments and donors are keen,&#13;
especially in the context of decentralization and increasing urbanization, to increase the drive towards&#13;
institutional efficiency and effectiveness for policy-making and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Although sector reform policies have been put into place in a number of countries in the region, progress&#13;
in implementing these policies has been slow due to a combination of factors (differing from country-to-&#13;
country) which include; weak local capacity, lack of appropriate institutional frameworks, and lack of&#13;
support for sector reform from critical constituencies of stakeholders. As a result, in most countries a&#13;
wide gap exists between national policies and actual implementation. The MDGs provide strengthened&#13;
impetus for accelerating policy reforms as well as large-scale implementation of sector initiatives. WSP-&#13;
EAP will continue to work with clients and partners to formulate pragmatic approaches to achieving the&#13;
water and sanitation goals.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation is the least well addressed of the major policy issues in the WSS sector in East Asia. Poor&#13;
sanitation services are having serious implications for water quality, which has steadily deteriorated in&#13;
many parts of the region. The resultant unsanitary conditions in rural and urban environments are a main&#13;
cause of the region's high burden of water-borne and related diseases.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the top-down service delivery approaches used in the past, the poor have benefited little from&#13;
sector interventions. Hence, the question as to how to target poor people and ensure that they get access&#13;
to services is a largely unresolved question in the region. With urban growth accelerating in many of the&#13;
countries in East Asia, the issue of how to provision small towns ­ where a large part of this urban growth&#13;
has been focused ­ has become increasingly important and has caught the eye of the policymakers in a&#13;
number of countries. Improving access to sustainable and equitable WSS services in rural areas and small&#13;
towns also remains a key challenge. As the incidence of poverty is higher in remote rural areas, helping&#13;
to reduce the gap between service delivery in accessible and remote areas will be important in terms of&#13;
poverty alleviation.&#13;

WSP-EAP's Role WSP-EAP has been focusing in the past few years on assisting governments in the&#13;
formulation and implementation of realistic WSS reform policies that are being supported by a wide&#13;
range of sector stakeholders. In FY05 the regional Program began a shift from activities focused largely&#13;
on community-based initiatives in rural areas to a broader platform addressing the complexities of the&#13;
urban sector and, implicitly, the key institutions responsible for urban service delivery.     In its policy&#13;
reform activities, WSP-EAP has gained extensive knowledge about which WSS policies work and which&#13;
do not in the region, and what institutional arrangements can most effectively operationalize sound&#13;
policies. Over the past two years, WSP-EAP has worked with our partners and clients in five focal&#13;
countries to understand the implications of the MDGs for sector planning and resource mobilization and&#13;
to develop national strategies to achieve the Goals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
East Asia/Pacific                                                                           FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's role continues to include the mobilization and optimal use of clients' and partners' resources to&#13;
achieve the MDGs through more effective institutions. WSP-EAP's comparative advantage has been&#13;
biased toward community-managed services. Beginning in FY04, the Program initiated a concerted shift to&#13;
broaden its base of expertise to encompass the full gamut of WSS services, including formal WSS utilities&#13;
and informal, small scale independent providers. In FY06, the Program will continue to broaden and&#13;
strengthen its capabilities at the urban end of the sector while maintaining its established business strength&#13;
in the community-managed arena. Since 2002, the Program's participatory development focus has shifted&#13;
from research and pilots toward institutionalization of best practice through large-scale investments.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity building for governments to launch or enhance policy-making efforts is supported by practical&#13;
efforts to underpin the development of workable strategies, action plans, and overall approaches that make&#13;
policy happen. Training and other activities to enhance local capacities is an integral part of most WSP-&#13;
EAP initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Underpinning the policy and implementation work is a program of knowledge generation and&#13;
management through studies, field trials, pilot and demonstration activities resulting in lessons that can&#13;
feed into policy formulation and implementation, as well as in support of the design and implementation&#13;
of large-scale investments. Set within a background of capacity building (a key comparative advantage),&#13;
this juxtaposes the important roles of supporting sector policy formulation and developing workable,&#13;
achievable approaches, and identifies the important sector coordinating role of WSP-EAP in respect to&#13;
policy, implementation, and knowledge management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP Comparative Advantage: WSP-EAP has an established field network that maintains close&#13;
relationships with many governments and other stakeholders active in the WSS sector. The Program is&#13;
viewed as an honest broker, able to assist clients grappling with reform and to strengthen learning and&#13;
partnerships across the region. WSP-EAP has a proven track record in the formulation of sector policies.&#13;
It also has a strong background in introducing new ideas in areas such as utilization of participatory&#13;
approaches, hygiene promotion, gender, and community-based service delivery to the poor, and the&#13;
introduction/development of methods to measure the sustainability of WSS services.&#13;
Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-EAP seeks to use the initiatives and resources of its partners to&#13;
implement sector reforms and accelerate efforts to achieve the MDGs through support for developing&#13;
financing strategies, the design and supervision of large-scale investments, and by generating and sharing&#13;
lessons from field experience in key focus areas. The activities in the region are concentrated primarily,&#13;
but not exclusively, in five countries that have committed to sector reforms: Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,&#13;
the Philippines, and Vietnam. These countries have been selected because of their high rates of poverty,&#13;
demand for WSS services, the availability of financial partners, and learning opportunities. The thematic&#13;
approach for the region is directly linked to the major challenges that still lie ahead: (i) to focus attention,&#13;
resources, and effective responses on the burgeoning sanitation challenge in the region; (ii) to assist&#13;
national partners to understand the magnitude of investments required and develop strategies to optimize&#13;
both domestic and external resources to achieve the MDGs; and (iii) to ensure that the poor are benefiting&#13;
equally from WSS interventions.&#13;
&#13;
Key projects: Key projects in the region are focusing on the practical design and implementation of&#13;
improved RWSS policies linked to large-scale sector investments.&#13;
· Indonesia: Second phase of the Water and Sanitation Policy Formulation and Implementation&#13;
    Project; Indonesia Sanitation Sector Development Program; analysis of the urban WSS service&#13;
    provider framework; and strategic support for several large-scale RWSS projects.&#13;
· Laos PDR: Institutional and regulatory reform for the sanitation sector; Scaling up of RWSS policies&#13;
    through Bank-funded large-scale RWSS projects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
East Asia/Pacific                                                                         FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Philippines: An expanded program to improve the effectiveness of large-scale investments in both&#13;
    rural and urban water supply and sanitation services; support for implementing the President's&#13;
    Priority Program on Water.&#13;
    Vietnam: Development of a unified sanitation strategy and investment plan; analysis of RWSS&#13;
    management models; and structured learning linked to the Red River Delta RWSS Project.&#13;
&#13;
Regional: WSP-EAP's financial support primarily flows through country-focused projects, with very&#13;
limited resources for thematic, regional initiatives. The selection of regional activities is highly strategic&#13;
and focused on regional knowledge products and the development of new initiatives. Strengthening links&#13;
with regional partners including the Southeast Asia Water Utilities Network, AIT, the Stockholm&#13;
Environment Institute, and International Development Enterprises as well as enhanced integration with&#13;
the operations of the multilateral investment banks and bilateral programs in water and sanitation will&#13;
leverage the effective use and impacts of WSP-EAP's analytical work, technical assistance, and&#13;
knowledge products.&#13;
&#13;
A focal activity in FY06 will be preparations for the East Asia Ministerial Conference on Sanitation, with&#13;
the objective to mobilize awareness, political impetus, and popular support for broad-based investments&#13;
in sanitation infrastructure and their effective use.&#13;
&#13;
A second regional focus to develop in FY06 is sector financing strategies to achieve the MDGs. Regional&#13;
resources will be applied to synthesizing learning from country-focused fiscal analysis and the&#13;
development of financing strategies, including applied research on understanding and enabling the&#13;
domestic private sector's role in water and sanitation service provision.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, WSP-EAP is engaged with WSP colleagues in South Asia and other regions for systematic&#13;
learning initiatives in the areas of sanitation, arsenic mitigation, and WSS service management and&#13;
institutional models in the context of decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
The Program will also be seeking partners for an initiative to assist governments and service providers in&#13;
the greater Mekong Region and facilitate knowledge sharing to optimize WSS services for the poor and&#13;
scale up service provision to achieve the MDGs. Opportunities for strategic support in new countries in&#13;
the region will also be explored.&#13;
&#13;
Cambodia&#13;
The Challenge: Cambodia faces some of the region's greatest challenges in water, sanitation, and overall&#13;
poverty reduction. Access to water and sanitation is still quite low; current census figures place coverage&#13;
at 24% for rural water, 60% for urban water, less than 9% for rural sanitation and 49% for urban&#13;
sanitation. Local institutions and sector investors, though their capacities are improving rapidly, still fall&#13;
short of meeting these challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Inter-organizational and political frictions are major constraints to WSS sector progress. The Ministry of&#13;
Rural Development (MRD), the lead central agency for community-managed WSS, is currently allied&#13;
with the opposition to the ruling party. MRD appears to be losing ground to the Ministry of Industry,&#13;
Mines, and Energy (MIME), which has oversight of piped water supplies managed by formal institutions.&#13;
Additionally, the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWRAM) is a formal signatory to the Water and&#13;
Sanitation Policy Framework, but feels that its own umbrella Water Resource Policy is the one to be&#13;
followed, even though that policy does not address drinking water and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Cambodia must make very large leaps to develop sustainable water and sanitation services if it is to&#13;
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (currently considered unlikely). Cambodia developed a&#13;
national MDG strategy with assistance from WSP-EAP in 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        42&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
East Asia/Pacific                                                                      FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Challenges to WSP-EAP's role to support the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) in developing a&#13;
policy environment and strategies for meeting the MDGs in Cambodia is&#13;
· Low institutional and human resource capacity at all levels;&#13;
· The complex political and organizational environment.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: WSP-EAP has supported MRD's development of a RWSS Policy Framework using&#13;
a participatory stakeholder consultation process over the period 1999-2002. More recently, the Council of&#13;
Ministers, has endorsed a sector-wide policy framework that includes the RWSS policy, and laws have&#13;
been drafted to support implementation. A comprehensive implementation and investment strategy is&#13;
now needed, and WSP is well-placed to provide the assistance required for this, along with generating&#13;
new investment for large-scale implementation.&#13;
&#13;
MIME is piloting innovative management models, such as design-build-lease, and output based aid. This&#13;
ministry is developing a regulatory framework and eligibility criteria for private sector involvement in&#13;
WSS for small towns.       These initiatives provide opportunities for WSP to apply its comparative&#13;
advantage as a knowledge management organization and having staff on the ground in Cambodia.&#13;
MRD has signed an agreement with ADB for RWSS investment in five provinces, aiming to achieve the&#13;
rural water supply and sanitation MDGs in those provinces three years ahead of schedule. The investment&#13;
focus of this project creates important complementary opportunities for WSP in the development and&#13;
support of the domestic private sector in Rural Water Supply and Sanitation delivery, as well as the use of&#13;
sanitation informed choice tools under development.&#13;
&#13;
RGC's focus on MDGs in developing its PRSP, along with WB's designation of Cambodia as a MDG&#13;
flagship country, adds momentum to improving the WSS sector in Cambodia and heightens WSP-EAP's&#13;
potential role in that process. As requested by MRD and MIME, WSP-EAP envisions playing a crucial&#13;
role in Cambodia's WSS sector to promote nationally-led processes to develop and implement effective&#13;
strategic approaches, encourage sectoral learning, and foster donor coordination.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Role: A major constraint in Cambodia is the lack of coordination between government line&#13;
agencies/ ministries, external support agencies (ESAs), and NGOs; WSP-EAP can play a critical role in&#13;
promoting cooperation between these key groups. WSP-EAP is also well positioned to help RGC&#13;
develop and implement strategies to carry out its PRSP and achieve the MDGs in the WSS sector, and to&#13;
assist the WB to implement flagship WSS projects.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Comparative Advantage: WSP-EAP has emerged as an honest broker in the WSS sector&#13;
through its relationships with a wide range of partners and clients, and deep involvement with national&#13;
RWSS policy reform and strategic dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's 1999-2002 partnership with MRD and other stakeholders in preparing the RWSS Policy&#13;
Framework enhanced its position. Similarly, cross support of WB operations in the preparation of the&#13;
Cambodia Provincial and Peri-Urban WSS Project with MIME has helped WSP-EAP to develop a good&#13;
relationship with MIME and its provincial partners.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Strategic Activity Selection: In Cambodia, as elsewhere in the region, WSP-EAP has taken&#13;
an inclusive, demand-responsive approach to developing its business plan for FY06.            A series of&#13;
discussions were held with key partners and Cambodian clients to determine WSP-EAP's optimal role,&#13;
starting from the regional thematic conference on mobilizing resources to achieve the MDGs. The&#13;
Cambodian delegation developed key recommendations for WSP-EAP support. Subsequently, a series of&#13;
meetings were held in Cambodia with significant stakeholders to develop the detailed business plan.&#13;
The business plan builds on WSP-EAP's previous support program focused on RWSS policy reform.&#13;
Major areas of concentration will be:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
East Asia/Pacific                                                                          FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Action research and technical assistance to develop and support the role of the domestic private sector&#13;
in WSS service provision;&#13;
· Support for evaluating the effectiveness of household water purification systems, and establishing a&#13;
national verification system for domestic water treatment technologies;&#13;
· Analytical work and technical assistance for developing and launching implementation of a sanitation&#13;
marketing strategy for both rural and urban areas;&#13;
· Developing a wider range of sanitation technology options for Cambodians, along with sanitation&#13;
informed choice tools for use by sector practitioners.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia&#13;
The Challenge: Access to WSS services continues to be low in Indonesia, with a general recognition that&#13;
the WSS MDG targets are not likely to be met. While there are no nationally accepted criteria to define&#13;
"sustainable access" yet, currently only 50% of the population has access to water from "improved&#13;
sources" which does not imply any guarantees about the water being safe to drink. A 2003 study by&#13;
UNSFIR projected that 24 out of Indonesia's 32 provinces will fail to reach MDG targets for safe&#13;
drinking water supply by 2015.&#13;
&#13;
The policy environment improved significantly in 2003 with the establishment of a Policy Framework for&#13;
Community-based Water and Environmental Sanitation Development.               However, its implementation&#13;
strategy is still not well developed, awaiting a national assessment of sector investment needs and a&#13;
financing strategy to reach the MDGs. Urban sanitation is the least well-addressed of major policy issues&#13;
in Indonesia. Poor sanitation in cities and small towns is posing population health hazards through&#13;
pollution of both ground and surface water sources used by urban populations for a variety of purposes.&#13;
Disposal and treatment of sewage is available for less than 5% of the population. Top-down delivery&#13;
systems of the past have led to the poor not gaining appreciable access to safe sanitation services in both&#13;
urban and rural areas&#13;
&#13;
The economic crisis of the late `90s severely curtailed investment in infrastructure. Central government&#13;
spending on development dropped from $14 billion in 1994 to $5 billion in 2002, within which the share&#13;
of infrastructure spending further declined from 57 to 30% over the same period. Moreover, poor&#13;
institutional and regulatory frameworks and rampant corruption in the infrastructure sector, which were&#13;
prevalent even before the crisis, continued without serious sector reform efforts by the government until&#13;
very recently. Decentralization in 2001 complicated matters further, by handing over responsibility and&#13;
control of local infrastructure to autonomous district governments without providing them adequate&#13;
access to funds or expertise for infrastructure development. More recently, natural disasters of an&#13;
unprecedented scale such as the December 2004 tsunami and several earthquakes since then, have&#13;
inevitably diverted attention and funds towards emergency relief and reconstruction/rehabilitation efforts,&#13;
rather than policy and strategy improvements.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Given the sector situation in Indonesia, WSP-EAP has mobilized a substantial&#13;
increase in its resources to begin a strategic shift towards improving policies and institutional capacities in&#13;
the urban WSS sector, and a shift towards programmatic support for scaling up rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Policy formulation work through the second Water Supply and Sanitation Policy and Action Planning&#13;
(WASPOLA II) project is building inter-ministerial stakeholder consensus for a policy framework for&#13;
Institutionally-Managed WSS services (covering public utilities, local government, and private sector ­&#13;
formal and informal). This process is supported with relevant sector analysis and research studies. The&#13;
post-tsunami aid flooding into Aceh presents a new learning opportunity that WSP-EAP will capitalize on&#13;
through a study of corruption in the water sector. The 4-year Dutch trust funded ISSDP(Indonesia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
East Asia/Pacific                                                                        FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation Sector Development Program) is starting up by mid-2005, to support the developments of an&#13;
urban sanitation policy and investment framework and an enabling regulatory framework for sustainable&#13;
sanitation, build local government capacity for urban sanitation improvements, and help design large&#13;
urban sanitation investments.      The MDGs provide necessary platforms for bringing about greater&#13;
coordination of funding from all sources to meet commonly agreed targets.             The government has&#13;
requested WSP-EAP assistance both for facilitating such coordination and for helping to establish&#13;
common data baselines and monitoring systems for the MDG targets. Country level MDG awareness-&#13;
raising workshops were organized with WSP-EAP assistance during FY04. Priority actions and strategies&#13;
were identified therein, which were incorporated into Project Sheets and specific activities for FY05 and&#13;
FY06.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's role: WSP-EAP's niche is leveraging and influencing sector investments in the interests of&#13;
the poor, at a national scale. In Indonesia WSP-EAP thus focuses on policy reform, strategy development&#13;
to operationalize sector reform, improving the effectiveness of large-scale investments, analytical work on&#13;
institutional issues, and building strategic alliances with and among other players. Perceived as a "&#13;
neutral broker in the sector, WSP-EAP is ideally placed to initiate and facilitate consensus building with a&#13;
wide range of stakeholders.        WSP-EAP strives to build capacity and generate new knowledge&#13;
collaboratively, to ensure ownership of the new knowledge and capacity by partners and clients WSP-&#13;
EAP experiments with innovative approaches and shares learning gained with country clients and donor&#13;
partners who then invest in scaling up innovations.         In addition, due to WSP-EAP's institutional&#13;
proximity to the World Bank, it is an internal advocate and professional knowledge resource for Bank&#13;
colleagues on how to reach the poor with sustainable WSS improvements through WB strategies and&#13;
instruments.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's comparative advantage: WSP-EAP's image of a neutral (not pressurized by lending&#13;
requirements) professional organization in the business of providing knowledge services has built its&#13;
credibility with clients and partners. Its 14 years' presence in Indonesia has allowed it to accumulate a&#13;
critical mass of sector knowledge relevant in the country and region as well as link the country effectively&#13;
with global knowledge sources. WSP's multi-disciplinary skill mix places it in great demand among&#13;
client and partner institutions in Indonesia. Examples include high volume of cross-support requested by&#13;
the WB for both sectoral and multi-sector projects, past and ongoing technical assistance requests from&#13;
partner ESAs (ADB, UNICEF, AusAID, USAID, DFID, GTZ, KfW).&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Strategic Activity selection: The desired country level outcomes (multi-year) that WSP-EAR&#13;
has chosen to pursue through its FY06 Business Plan are: a) Development and operationalization of high&#13;
quality national sector policies aimed at sustainability and effective use of WSS services ( Institutionally-&#13;
Managed and Community-Based) by all socio-economic classes, b) Establishment of an enabling policy&#13;
and regulatory environment to attract and efficiently manage investments from all sources for sustainable&#13;
and pro-poor urban sanitation improvements, at a rate required for the achievement of the WSS-MDG&#13;
targets; c) Local government (city and district-level) capacity built for accessing sector financing,&#13;
managing and scaling up WSS services in line with new sector policies ­ linking the scaling up to WSS-&#13;
MDG targets and action plans at local levels, and d) scaling up improved sanitation and hygiene&#13;
behaviors by the rural and urban poor.&#13;
&#13;
The Indonesia country program's activity selection to achieve these outcomes over the next 3 years&#13;
includes a strategic mix of:&#13;
· trust-funded country-level projects supporting sector policy/strategy development, and enabling&#13;
     environment-and-local capacity building for operationalizing sector reform (WASPOLA, ISSDP) as&#13;
     the means of achieving the WSS-MDGs locally and nationally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

East Asia/Pacific                                                                                 FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Filling specific sector research gaps additionally with external resources (e.g.                    PPIAF, CTF,&#13;
     GENFUND) and selective involvement in World Bank Indonesia's AAA work on water supply,&#13;
     sanitation and poverty reduction.&#13;
· Scaling up of innovative approaches developed by WSP-EAP for improving services to the rural and&#13;
     urban/small town poor through the strategic supervision of large scale sector and multi-sector World&#13;
     Bank projects, and technical assistance provided on demand to partner agency projects (ADB's&#13;
     Community Water, Sanitation and Health project, GTZ-KfW's PROAIR, AusAID's Area Focus&#13;
     Projects, USAID's Environmental Services Program)&#13;
· Strategic support for large-scale investments, including for preparing the national program&#13;
     (NPCWSSS) which is an opportunity to move Indonesia from project-focused to a programmatic&#13;
     approach in RWSS, with the accompanying sector institutional reforms across the country that will&#13;
     apply to sector investments from all sources thereafter.&#13;
&#13;
Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)&#13;
The Challenge:    2  At the recent WSP-EAP Regional Retreat held in April 2005 in Guilin, China, senior&#13;
sector actors identified the major financing challenges and vision to 2008 for the sanitation sector in Lao&#13;
PDR.&#13;
&#13;
Given the low coverage of sanitary facilities, particularly in the rural areas, the major financing challenge&#13;
is seen as attracting new investors to the sector, which as yet has not been identified as a priority by the&#13;
government. GoL is aiming to move from a supply-driven approach to creating an enabling environment&#13;
that will encourage individuals to pay for their own on-site sanitary facilities by creating demand for&#13;
sanitation under a cohesive national strategy. Graduated subsidies for different latrine options have been&#13;
developed by Nam Saat to focus scarce resources to the poorest, remote communities; but reluctance to&#13;
change behavior, low public awareness, and lack of financing options at the local level are seen as major&#13;
obstacles to developing supply chains, increasing access to and the effective use of latrines, and&#13;
improving hygiene in both rural and urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
These problems are further constrained by an unclear legal framework for roles, responsibilities and&#13;
actions, where currently many different ministries have overlapping sanitation functions.                    This is&#13;
complicated by the need to provide access to information to 47 ethnic minority groups, each with their&#13;
own language (often only oral with no script) and many of whom do not speak the national Lao language&#13;
­ particularly women and girls. There is a lack of skilled technicians capable of providing advice on&#13;
latrine options to suit the different geological and economic conditions. The full range of technical&#13;
options for latrines has not yet been translated into Lao language, although the rural sector has made&#13;
significant progress with developing a ladder of options for 6 core types of latrine.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: GoL has identified the sanitation sector as a development priority. A RWSS sector&#13;
strategy has been formulated in 1997, and then applied, piloted, and refined (June 2004). An urban&#13;
strategy to 2020 is currently being developed with support from ADB. The National Growth and Poverty&#13;
Eradication Strategy identify the 47 poorest districts in the country as priority for assistance and&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
There is currently a relatively small population of around 5.6 million, and a population density of about&#13;
19 persons/km2. There are no mega-cities and urban migration is relatively low. There are no official&#13;
slum areas in the country. However, the current annual population growth is 2.8% - the highest in&#13;
ASEAN countries - which means that the population of Lao PDR will double by the year 2025. If the&#13;

                                                            46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
East Asia/Pacific                                                                         FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
framework for sanitation can be put in place now, then the country has a very good prospect for getting&#13;
adequate sanitation facilities to the majority of the population in a timely manner.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP Lao PDR Country Office's (LCO's) support role is currently focusing on these challenges&#13;
through: consolidation of existing legislation, policy and strategy bringing together rural and urban&#13;
sanitation activities that could enable domestic investment and supply chain development; developing&#13;
mechanisms to effectively apply consolidated legislation to support policy and strategy actions at field&#13;
level, ensuring full participation and discernment by all stakeholders, for example in the development of a&#13;
one-stop shop for sanitation services and dialogue with recently established SME promotion agencies to&#13;
build the local private sector; improving access to information, engaging clients and partners in&#13;
communications, and networking among sector agencies to ensure that regional and international good&#13;
practices are properly translated into Lao language to facilitate broad consensus building and common&#13;
understanding for effective knowledge management; assisting national agencies to improve coordination&#13;
between sector partners.&#13;
&#13;
In parallel to this, WSP-EAP also provides support to GoL for development and application of its&#13;
National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), specifically related to sanitation for ethnic&#13;
minority, poverty and gender issues in the production of IEC materials and technology options. Equally&#13;
important, WSP-EAP is committed to assisting GoL to improve its sector performance to realize NGPES&#13;
targets and MDGs as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Role: GoL has commitment to refining, developing, and tailoring its policy and strategy&#13;
environment to ensure that NGPES and MDG targets are achieved, with national agencies taking the lead&#13;
in these efforts. A few ESAs and NGOs are providing technical and financial support to GoL in the&#13;
sanitation sector. However, almost all those supporting agencies focus on their specific projects. There is&#13;
little involvement from the private sector outside of the major urban centers. WSP-EAP, through its&#13;
support role to national agencies involved in the sector, is able to bridge the gap between GoL&#13;
policymakers, ESAs and NGOs, and the private sector thereby enhancing the capacities of sector partners&#13;
to facilitate and guide sustainable development of sanitation&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Comparative Advantage: Through its ability to broker effectively among sector partners,&#13;
WSP-EAP is helping GoL capture learning and reflects it in consolidation and clarification of legislation,&#13;
policies and strategies. WSP-EAP's links with the WB enable it to assist GoL with negotiations and&#13;
project planning related to WB and other funding agencies' investments. WSP-EAP's links to GoL also&#13;
provide added value to WB analytical work in the sanitation sector, especially in preparation and&#13;
application of the WB's CAS and PRSC. WSP-EAP is also fully aligned with WB activities and&#13;
responsible for supervising investments at the field level. Therefore, WSP-EAP LCO has roles from the&#13;
micro to macro levels, and is helping the GoL to translate its own strategies into action.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Strategic Activity Selection:&#13;
· Encourage a nationally led process of review and improvement of existing legislation, policies and&#13;
     strategies, and develop coherent investment plans for national application.&#13;
· Share lessons learned in the sector and utilize these experiences for scaling up of activities nationwide&#13;
     and further improve understanding within the sector of supply chains, financing options and locally&#13;
     available tools and materials whilst improving communities' access to information.&#13;
· Continue instituting learning throughout the sanitation sector nationwide and advance the process of&#13;
     review and feedback from government and sector partners to better tailor WSP-EAP responses to&#13;
     client needs.&#13;
· Maintain strategic alignment with WB operations to improve the effectiveness of investments in the&#13;
     field, and report, communicate and manage LCO activities effectively.&#13;

The Philippines&#13;
The Challenge: Access to water supply and sanitation is recognized as key to promoting health, reducing&#13;
poverty and facilitating economic development. This is reflected in the President's ten-point agenda and&#13;
the Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan (2005-2010), which sets out targets that will exceed the&#13;
country's WSS MDGs commitments. Plans are now underway for a large rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation program, the President's Priority Program on Water (P3W), to carry out this vision. The&#13;
President has also appointed the National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) Secretary General and Lead&#13;
Convener as the Water and Power Czar to coordinate and oversee the implementation of government's&#13;
water programs.&#13;
&#13;
But fundamental problems underlying sector performance need to be addressed if the targets are to be&#13;
reached and the desired health and poverty impacts are to be achieved. Coverage of water supply grew&#13;
only moderately over the last 10 years, with recent official data showing coverage decline. Rapid&#13;
urbanization in many parts of the country accentuates the disparity between erstwhile rural communities&#13;
and urban centers where network coverage has been confined. An overwhelming number of water and&#13;
sanitation service providers have less than 5,000 connections and only modestly expanded over their&#13;
lifetime. Overall coverage also hides the poor quality of service in terms of quality, quantity, and&#13;
reliability.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: While the President's program presents a significant opportunity, there is need to&#13;
ensure long-term viability of the sector and water utilities through the pursuit of ongoing sector reforms&#13;
on performance regulation, and rationalized financing. In particular, GoP is keen to ensure that water&#13;
supply service is provided with minimum national subsidies or such subsidies are used to leverage other&#13;
resources and that existing water service providers improve their performance and expand their service.&#13;
GoP has embarked on a number of reforms to support the improving sector performance. These include&#13;
the reorganization of the National Water Resources Board, passing of the Clean Water Act, reforms in the&#13;
sector financing framework, appointment of a water sector coordinator, and revisions of designs of rural&#13;
water projects, most recently the President's Priority Program on Water.&#13;
&#13;
Thus, while the medium-term strategy is to increase access in these identified `waterless' municipalities&#13;
to 50% coverage through direct support in the construction of additional infrastructure, the long-term&#13;
strategy is to increase coverage beyond 50% through the viability of the sector and service providers.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Role: WSP-EAP's role is primarily addressed to this longer-term sector improvement&#13;
strategy. The strategy is focused on supporting the increasing viability of water supply service&#13;
providers. If the water provider is not viable, investments would continue to be wasted and opportunity&#13;
to leverage other funds from the private sector would be missed. WSP-EAP seeks to respond analytically&#13;
and practically to institutional issues that are constraining the growth, expansion and access to their own&#13;
sources of funds by water service providers and supporting the establishment of an economic regulator for&#13;
water service. Recent programming consultations with the Government identified the following strategic&#13;
areas of work:&#13;
&#13;
     Water service provider (utility) performance improvement&#13;
     Establishing and strengthening economic regulatory systems&#13;
     Supporting the implementation of sector financing reforms&#13;
     Facilitating interventions to remove demand and supply constraints in the sanitation sector&#13;
&#13;
Areas of special interest include:&#13;
     Assisting implementation of the President's Priority Program for Water (P3W) and,&#13;
     Supporting roll-out of current reforms through coordination and communications&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
East Asia/Pacific                                                                          FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Comparative Advantage:               WSP-EAP has gained the reputation of being a respected,&#13;
independent source of knowledge in the water and sanitation sector. The Program's comparative&#13;
advantage derives from its brand of collaborative technical assistance. This mode of operation has proven&#13;
effective in the Philippines, where WSP, through the partnership of government and non-government&#13;
actors under the Water Supply and Sanitation Performance Enhancement Project, facilitated the&#13;
development and implementation of a systematic learning and review of sector progress in the last 30&#13;
years and increased understanding of and consensus over key improvement areas for service delivery in&#13;
various aspects of the sector: rural water supply, urban poor water supply, small towns water supply,&#13;
urban sewerage and sanitation, community-based systems and financing and subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
In the Philippines, all activities are undertaken by a team composed of representatives from government&#13;
and WSP-EAP and peer-reviewed by national and international sector practitioners within the World&#13;
Bank and non-government or academic institutions. The Program is demand responsive, provides direct&#13;
input to capacity building, delivers technical knowledge in real time, and works within local realities.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP is increasingly investing in shared infrastructure, knowledge and expertise that would&#13;
otherwise be unaffordable for single countries, acting alone, to develop.           For example, WSP has&#13;
developed a number of methods and tools for improving poverty-targeting and demand-responsiveness&#13;
within rural water supply projects, which have been benchmarked for sustainability across developing&#13;
countries. It has led the research on small towns' water supply, local private providers and rural water&#13;
supply financing in the Philippines, drawing on from the global WSP knowledge and skills. It supports&#13;
the systematic monitoring of utility performance in various countries and has also recently commenced&#13;
global programs for sanitation marketing.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP works with long-standing commitment to sector improvements and reforms. Thus, it is able to&#13;
provide institutional gravity for the sector through continuity of its knowledge generation, dissemination&#13;
and facilitation activities. It is able to act as honest broker among sector stakeholders, particularly among&#13;
public, private, non-government and international stakeholders. Through its analytical and piloting work,&#13;
WSP-EAP has been able to provide well-informed advice to the sector, which facilitated the policy&#13;
discussions and reforms now underway.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Strategic Activity Selection: Following extensive sector investigations, WSP-EAP is now&#13;
implementing a consolidation phase to allow the development of a more coordinated response within GoP&#13;
and other stakeholders to the challenges raised.           The current phase supports the development of&#13;
tools/systems that help implement reform programs and enhancing performance in the delivery of WSS&#13;
services through performance monitoring and capacity-building and strategic communications aimed at&#13;
small towns' utilities, oversight agencies and local governments. There is also particular focus on&#13;
increasing knowledge and demand for sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, a proposal for an expanded implementation phase is now under discussion, which takes&#13;
WSP-EAP work in the Philippines from research into full implementation, addressing the strategic areas&#13;
agreed during the programming consultations. The basic intervention strategy proposed is to develop, test&#13;
and implement systems and mechanisms that support increasing viability of (existing and future) water&#13;
service providers through improved performance, expanding coverage and strengthened ability to access&#13;
and effectively utilize different sources of financing. Under the proposed expansion of work, WSP,&#13;
together with the World Bank urban sector team, proposes to support the investigation and design of a&#13;
mechanism for promoting utility access to domestic capital within the Philippines Water Financing.&#13;

&#13;
Vietnam&#13;
The Challenge: Vietnam is continuing to transition rapidly towards a market economy, and is&#13;
progressively adopting demand-responsive approaches and decentralizing governance, as well as shifting&#13;
its focus from coverage targets to achieving sustained access to WSS services for both urban and rural&#13;
populations. However, the sector still faces formidable challenges, such as poor governance and low&#13;
service efficiency. The roles and responsibilities of government agencies at the central and provincial&#13;
levels in the water and sanitation sector as well as between communities and local governments are vague&#13;
and overlapping, leading to institutional complexity for the sector as whole. Furthermore, institutional&#13;
capacity for managing major WSS initiatives remains weak.&#13;
&#13;
In the urban WSS sector in Vietnam, an inadequate policy and regulatory framework combined with&#13;
political pressures perpetuate inadequate tariffs in many cities. Consequently, the financial status of most&#13;
water and sanitation services providers is poor, and so is the service they provide. Although many urban&#13;
water supply utilities are in the process of equitization, there are inadequate legal frameworks and few&#13;
mechanisms to research and find answers concerning new issues. Small towns are the most rapidly&#13;
growing settlements, but they are the most neglected in terms of policy formulation and resource&#13;
allocation. Consequently, only a quarter of small towns throughout the country have piped water supply.&#13;
People in other small towns rely on water from increasingly polluted traditional sources. Efforts on Rural&#13;
WSS are only recently beginning to come together, and have suffered from under-resourcing and&#13;
scattered effort.&#13;
&#13;
During the last decade, the GoV and the donor community have been very active in improving access to&#13;
water supplies, but insufficient attention has been given to sanitation. As a result, human wastes and solid&#13;
wastes are becoming major issues at all levels. A 2001 report on the prospects for achieving the MDGs&#13;
gave Vietnam a rating of "probably" for water supply, and assessed the state of the supporting&#13;
environment as "strong". However, given the still low access figures in Vietnam (about 59 % and 34 % in&#13;
aggregate in 2005, for water and sanitation respectively), achieving the MDG remains a challenging&#13;
objective. This is particularly so for sanitation, the prognosis for which is much more uncertain than water&#13;
supply. The overall coverage figures also continue to mask wide urban / rural disparities in coverage&#13;
levels.&#13;
&#13;
The Specific Opportunities: Opportunities that WSP-EAP can capitalize on in Vietnam include:&#13;
· GoV increasingly recognizes the importance of sanitation, and the need for new efforts in this area.&#13;
     As a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization, this will be the main area of public and private&#13;
     investment in sector in the next 15-20 years in urban areas - but also in rural areas, to cope with&#13;
     growing populations, agricultural and small scale industrial activities. The local private sector needs&#13;
     to be stimulated too to match the unmet demand for sanitation from rural households.&#13;
· In 2000, GoV endorsed a national RWSS strategy and action plan. This strategy is underpinned by the&#13;
     principles of managing water as an economic as well as a social good, and demand responsiveness. It&#13;
     provides a reasonable framework for large-scale investments, provided that sufficient human capital&#13;
     is available, though it does now need some progressive updating to reflect the wide variety of rural&#13;
     situations and needs and new learning, and the need for wider promotion and acceptance remains.&#13;
· The WB CAS and the GoV Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy both&#13;
     acknowledge water and sanitation as key factors for reducing poverty, providing a strong basis for&#13;
     scaling up investments and the poverty reduction link that is at the heart of WSP's work.&#13;
· Vietnam committed to the MDGs in 2000, and has subsequently adopted linked Vietnam&#13;
     Development Goals (VDGs), linked to and further reinforcing the MDG commitments. In late 2003,&#13;
     WSP-EAP helped raised the profile of the commitments in co-supporting, with Danida, a study and&#13;
     linked participatory workshop on the MDGs / VDGs in Vietnam. This has provided an excellent basis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
East Asia/Pacific                                                                         FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    for ensuring all WSP-EAP activities are strongly linked to the MDGs, help raise awareness about&#13;
    them, and assist progress of the sector towards them.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Role: WSP-EAP has been engaged in Vietnam for over 15 years, primarily focusing on&#13;
policy reform in both the rural and urban WSS sectors and on human resource capacity building for urban&#13;
WSS. The program's recent focus has been on supporting large-scale investments, such as a planned&#13;
IDA-financed RRD RWSS project, and action research linked to major investments in order to enhance&#13;
the quality of project outcomes and ensure equitable and sustainable services. While the latter role will&#13;
continue, emphasis is also shifting toward meeting the Government's requests for a new emphasis on&#13;
sanitation, especially support to the development of a unified sanitation strategy for urban, peri-urban,&#13;
small towns and rural areas. This will be supplemented with a focus on improving small towns water&#13;
supply services and on capacity building through the Southeast Asia Water Utilities Network (SEAWUN)&#13;
and the Vietnam Water Supply Association (VWSA). These initiatives will all be targeted at helping&#13;
support and directly contribute to Vietnam's MDG / VDG efforts.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Comparative Advantage: WSP-EAP's sector focus allows it to accumulate a critical mass of&#13;
sector knowledge relevant to its focus countries as well as link effectively with global knowledge sources.&#13;
Its position as a professional organization providing knowledge services, unencumbered by lending&#13;
requirements, fosters credibility with clients and partners. WSP-EAP's multi-disciplinary skill mix creates&#13;
demand from client and partner institutions. Examples include the high volume of strategic support&#13;
requested in recent years by WB operations in Vietnam for both sectoral and multi-sector projects,&#13;
requests for technical input from partner ESAs such as UNICEF, DFID, Danida, AusAID, and GoV's&#13;
explicit requests for continued support. WSP-EAP's commitment to serving the poor and facilitating&#13;
achievement of the MDGs can continue to help give Government and other stakeholders give these key&#13;
aspects the importance they deserve.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP's Strategic Activity Selection: Activities are targeted at supporting outcomes that contribute&#13;
to achieving the MDGs in Vietnam. Those selected for FY 06 are each in support of multi-year projects.&#13;
· WSP-EAP's key activity in Vietnam during FY06 will be assisting GoV to develop a unified rural,&#13;
    urban, and small town sanitation strategy and action plan through processes to ensure a high degree of&#13;
    ownership and acceptance. This will help redress the imbalance between sanitation and water supply&#13;
    in all sub-sectors, and improve the eventual prospects for Vietnam to achieve the MDG / VDG&#13;
    targets.&#13;
· WSP-EAP will also continue an action research activity, initiated in FY 05, to assess the effectiveness&#13;
    of alternative management models for rural water and sanitation services. The expected outcome of&#13;
    the study is recommendations on appropriate management models for piped rural water supply and&#13;
    sanitation schemes. This activity will be the first of several in coming years feeding into the updating&#13;
    of the RWSS strategy, a key tool in MDG/VDG achievement.&#13;
· Additionally, WSP-EAP will prepare the ground for pilot project testing of WSS financing options -&#13;
    especially Design-Build-Lease (DBL) options - for small towns. This work is directly linked to the&#13;
    start up and implementation of the Vietnam Water Supply Development Project, a large scale IDA-&#13;
    financed initiative targeting district towns.&#13;
· Finally a new initiative will be undertaken to develop the capacity of urban utilities through a&#13;
    strategic alliance with the South East Asia Water Utilities Network (SEAWUN), focusing initially on&#13;
    the issue of non-revenue water, particularly related to house connections.&#13;

                                   LATIN AMERICA AND CARIBBEAN&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: The Water and Sanitation Program-Latin America and Caribbean Region (WSP-LAC)&#13;
includes two sub-regions: i) the Andean Region (Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador); and ii) Central America&#13;
Region (Honduras and Nicaragua). WSP-LAC's presence is strong in Peru and Honduras, but weaker in&#13;
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Moreover, WSP-LAC's geographical general presence in the region&#13;
could be reinforced in countries where poverty is a major challenge, such as El Salvador, Guatemala,&#13;
Haiti, Cuba, and areas of Mexico and Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
Latin American countries are known for their dual economies whereby urban development has been given&#13;
a priority, while rural development has often lagged behind. Indeed, there is still a major need in the&#13;
region to support the development of rural and small towns' WSS services, and to contribute to:&#13;
· integration of MDGs in government strategies, SWAPS, PRSPs, and monitoring processes;&#13;
· implementation of sector reforms and decentralization;&#13;
· small towns management options for water supply and condominial systems;&#13;
· rural sanitation, including the development of micro-credit systems; and&#13;
· handwashing and gender awareness.&#13;
&#13;
Another important demographic fact is that in the LAC region, 75% of the population lives in urban areas.&#13;
Poverty in urban areas of Latin America is a reality and it is not sufficiently addressed by WSP-LAC. It&#13;
is proposed to make UWSS a new key project for the region.&#13;
&#13;
Today, all major donors and LAC governments include in their water sector policy the dimension of&#13;
water resources management. In addition, there are some very positive water resource management&#13;
experiences at the community level in the Andean Region that need to be documented. It is proposed to&#13;
document the existing experiences at the community level, where WatSan Committees integrate this&#13;
dimension with success.&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with WSP's central strategy, WSP-LAC will be instrumental in enhancing knowledge&#13;
management in the region through its own channels or through exploring possibilities for partnerships&#13;
where impact can be maximized.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC staffing is another major challenge for the program. 10 members of WSP-LAC's staff are&#13;
located in Lima and 2 in Honduras. In order to better respond to demand and within a sustainable&#13;
financial framework, WSP-LAC will seek to reinforce its presence at the country level, notably in&#13;
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. It will also seek to reinforce its regional team with the recruitment of a&#13;
junior professional officer in Lima and another one in Honduras. Additional possible staffing includes a&#13;
sanitary engineer in Lima.&#13;
&#13;
The above-mentioned challenges are important especially given the fact that donor funding is often more&#13;
oriented towards Africa and Asia, but WSP-LAC believes that there are possibilities to move ahead with&#13;
innovative financial partnerships. Finally, proposed activities will be guided by demand, donor interest,&#13;
WSP-LAC's own strategy, capacity and know how, as well as impact.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Apart from ongoing RWSS and decentralization projects in Peru and Honduras that are&#13;
financed by the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), and the major Small Towns project financed by the&#13;
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), there are other possible opportunities. In Nicaragua,&#13;
there is an initial interest by SDC to support rural WSS if another donor joins in as well. In the Andean&#13;
region, the Comunidad Andina (an organization similar to the European Union) has expressed its interest in&#13;
developing a regional sector strategy, with possible support from the Japanese International Cooperation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Agency. In Bolivia, the GoB is giving more and more signs of wanting to collaborate with WSP-LAC. The&#13;
present small towns project could be used as a model to "export" in countries other than Peru, i.e., Bolivia,&#13;
Ecuador, and Nicaragua. As far as the "urban poor" project is concerned, WSP-LAC will discuss this issue&#13;
with key partners and municipalities of seven cities in order to carry out a comparative study.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Role: WSP-LAC will continue to support sector reform by providing TA to regulatory&#13;
institutions in order to create awareness of the need to include small towns and rural areas in new sector&#13;
policies. It will also provide policy makers with its experiences and lessons learned in the field (in Peru and&#13;
other Latin American countries) that can then be adapted for cross-regional learning to other countries'&#13;
needs, both within and without LAC. It will also act as a promoter, through documenting and analyzing&#13;
existing experiences in reaching the urban poor, and will present findings in a major international event in&#13;
2006.    In addition, WSP-LAC will play a facilitating role in constituting "Grupos de Concertación"&#13;
(Consultation Groups) in projects where it is involved, as this process has proven to be an effective&#13;
mechanism for enhancing country ownership, project monitoring, and follow-up. Concerning knowledge-&#13;
management, WSP-LAC will assess the impact of its publications and other informational products at the&#13;
reader level. This will help WSP-LAC to strengthen and refocus its regional communications strategy, and&#13;
therefore clarify its role as a knowledge and information broker. In Peru and Colombia, WSP-LAC is&#13;
continuing to develop the Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing (PPP-HW).                 This initiative&#13;
encourages the usage of soap when handwashing at key moments in order to reduce diarrheal disease. In&#13;
addition to raising awareness, the PPP-HW also includes components of hygiene behavior change and&#13;
ultimately has a significant public health impact. Finally, WSP-LAC will pursue its ongoing work on&#13;
monitoring and evaluation as well as sector information systems (under the communications work) to help&#13;
in the dissemination of lessons learned.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Comparative Advantage: WSP-LAC has the advantage of practicing regional outreach either&#13;
through its own channels or through the World Bank. It is recognized regionally as a facilitator that is&#13;
able to put institutions and people together. Furthermore, it has progressively gained a strong knowledge&#13;
of country realities in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Strategic Activity Selection: This coming year, WSP-LAC will develop activities in the&#13;
following areas:&#13;

    current approaches in providing sustainable WSS services to the urban poor;&#13;

    regional strategy aiming at the achievement of the MDGs;&#13;
· consolidate its regional communication strategy through an assessment and revision of current&#13;
    approaches;&#13;
· explore future potential activities for WSP-LAC;&#13;
· carry out and document existing rural and small towns projects, including the Handwashing Initiative,&#13;
    and disseminate these experiences to other countries (principally Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua);&#13;
· rural sanitation will be given more importance in discussions and negotiations, especially on the&#13;
    aspect of the development of financial mechanisms; and&#13;
· WSP-LAC will promote the necessity of including gender equity as a main issue in dissemination&#13;
    events.&#13;
&#13;
Bolivia and Ecuador&#13;
The Challenge: Bolivia faces significant challenges in meeting the WSS MDGs and is very unlikely to&#13;
reach these goals. Currently 75% of Bolivia's population has access to piped water. However, this average&#13;
hides significant differences - 93% of urban households have piped water access, but only 44% of rural&#13;
dwellings enjoy this basic service. Regional differences are also staggering, ranging from 51% in Beni/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Latin America/Caribbean                                                                    FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Pando to 86% in Santa Cruz. The situation for basic sanitation is even more appalling. One third of the&#13;
population lacks access to flush toilets or pit latrines (18% of urban households, 65% of rural dwellings).&#13;
Regional differences are significant here as well, ranging from 65% in Potosi to only 10% in Santa Cruz.&#13;
&#13;
Major sector challenges in Bolivia include the following:&#13;
· The definition of strategies and activities that enhance the sustainability of RWSS in order to include&#13;
    them in norms that will regulate future sector investments in public and private institutions. For&#13;
    example, more than 1.5 million people are geographically disperse and ethnically diverse.&#13;
· The identification of strategies and activities that enhance the management of WSS in rural&#13;
    municipalities and small towns of 2,000 to 10,000 people, and their inclusion within sector norms and&#13;
    future public and private investments.       More than 1.5 million Bolivians live in the 187 rural&#13;
    municipalities and 442,000 in 113 small towns.&#13;
&#13;
The WSS sector in Ecuador has a long history of poor performance, well below the standards of other&#13;
Latin American countries. The main problems include weak institutions and institutional overlap at all&#13;
levels, lack of sector policies, and absence of PSP in the provision of services. This results in low WSS&#13;
coverage rates, and investments that are neither sustainable nor able to keep up with growing demand.&#13;
&#13;
Among the major challenges are:&#13;
· Enhancing coverage and quality of services. WSS service levels are among the lowest in South&#13;
    America. Although total coverage rates show 61% for water supply and 40% for sanitation (with no&#13;
    wastewater treatment), these numbers hide the deficit in rural areas, where 50% of the population&#13;
    lives. In both rural and urban areas, water supply is intermittent and few systems provide continuing&#13;
    treatment. Nationwide, sector investments have failed to keep up with population growth, and&#13;
    coverage actually decreased three percentage points between 1990 and 1995.&#13;
· Enhancing the sustainability of RWSS. In rural areas, communities have demonstrated relatively&#13;
    good capacity to keep the water flowing, more or less, on shoe-string budgets. Nonetheless, these&#13;
    systems also show a dramatic decrease in water quality, and design flows over time. They also suffer&#13;
    from poor financial management and are not sustainable in the long term.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Bolivia is a country with sound policies as well as public and private institutions ready&#13;
to strengthen reform in the water and sanitation sector. The Law of Popular Participation (1994), the Law&#13;
of National Dialogue (2000), Law 2049 that declared strengthening the Vice-ministry of Basic Services as a&#13;
national priority (2002), Law 2066 of Water Supply and Sanitation (2002), the National Strategy for&#13;
Poverty Reduction, and the National Fund for Regional Development are part of the legislation and entities&#13;
available to strengthen this reform. Moreover, local municipalities will receive increased government&#13;
transfers due to the annulment of the external debt. These increased government transfers could be used for&#13;
water and sanitation projects. For these reasons, the WB considers Bolivia as one of the 35 focus countries&#13;
to support in the achievement of the MDGs for water and sanitation. The GoB has recently issued the Plan&#13;
Bolivia-Sector de Agua y Saneamiento, which outlines the 5-year strategy for the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the GoB and the WB have initiated talks to design a WSS program to enhance WSS management&#13;
in small towns nationwide, but especially the sanitation services for the poor in the city of Santa Cruz.&#13;
&#13;
Ecuador's major opportunity for WSS in rural areas and small towns lies with the PRAGUAS project.&#13;
This ten-year project aims to increase coverage and effective use of sustainable WSS in Ecuador, with a&#13;
focus on the poorer populations in rural communities and small towns. An equally important and&#13;
associated objective is to support the GoE in the implementation of an overall WSS sector reform,&#13;
covering both urban and rural areas.&#13;
The key elements of the program are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Latin America/Caribbean                                                                  FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Investment support for rural areas and small towns;&#13;
· Development and application of improved policies; and&#13;
· Strengthening of sector institutions, including the Sub-Secretariat of Environmental Sanitation&#13;
    (within the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, or MIDUVI), municipal governments,&#13;
    community groups, WSS providers, and the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Role:&#13;
· To provide factual evidence to assess the current situation of relevant sector issues, including the&#13;
    sustainability of RWSS, hygiene practices among the urban poor, and WSS management in STs.&#13;
· To provide examples of best practices relevant to sector issues under discussion, i.e., condominial.&#13;
· Through sector networking groups, facilitate presentation, analysis, and dialogue on these issues.&#13;
· To provide technical support to the government and institutions willing to apply the lessons learned&#13;
    and best practices on these issues to their own policies and investments.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Comparative Advantage: WSP-LAC is well-known for its extensive experience in knowledge&#13;
management, provision of TA in the implementation of sector policies, and innovative technologies for the&#13;
provision of water and sanitation services in the Andean region. In addition, WSP-LAC has a wide&#13;
experience in networking with sector government agencies, NGOs, and cooperation agencies.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Strategic Activity Selection: Due to poverty conditions, the need to focus WSP-LAC's&#13;
investments and the opportunities of collaboration with current and future WB operations, WSP-LAC will&#13;
focus activities in Bolivia and Ecuador. In the next fiscal year, WSP-LAC will implement, in close&#13;
collaboration and coordination with sector networks, the following activities in Bolivia and Ecuador:&#13;
· A sustainability study of rural water and sanitation services in Ecuador and a similar study in Bolivia&#13;
    (already started in FY03);&#13;
· The development and strengthening of sector coordination networks in Ecuador and Bolivia;&#13;
· TA to Ecuadorian institutions willing to apply condominial technology in STs and urban areas;&#13;
· Assess the management of WSS in rural municipalities and small towns in Bolivia;&#13;
· Identify the best practices of hygiene education in RWSS projects in Ecuador; and&#13;
· Assess the hygienic practices among the urban poor in the city of Santa Cruz, Bolivia.&#13;
&#13;
Honduras and Nicaragua&#13;
The Challenge: Meeting the WSS MDGs in Honduras and Nicaragua demands financial, institutional,&#13;
and technological resources not readily available in these two HIPC countries. Low economic growth,&#13;
increasing unemployment, and elevated levels of poverty hinder sustained access of WSS to the rural and&#13;
urban poor. Although there is relatively high urban infrastructure coverage, (92% in Honduras and 91.4%&#13;
in Nicaragua), the reliability and quality of urban services is low (service 6 hours/day; 51% treated).&#13;
Even though the access to sanitation is 94% (Honduras) and 95% (Nicaragua), only 53% in the first and&#13;
34% in the second country are connected to sewerage systems. The remaining population is served by&#13;
septic tanks and individual solutions, where the poor are even worse served.             Low rural water&#13;
infrastructure coverage in Nicaragua (47.9%); relatively high in Honduras (70%) with extremely&#13;
unreliable service quality (14% treated; service every other day). Extremely low sanitation infrastructure&#13;
coverage in both countries (24% Nicaragua; 49.5% Honduras). In terms of sector reforms, both countries&#13;
have initiated substantial sector policy and regulation reforms in order to meet the MDGs. Despite these&#13;
efforts, weak institutions currently lead processes with unclear procedures on how to proceed&#13;
systematically.&#13;
&#13;
Major challenges for the water and sanitation sector in these two countries are the following:&#13;
· Local governments are now challenged with increased responsibilities for the provision of WSS;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              60&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Latin America/Caribbean                                                                 FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Limited opportunity for private-sector participation in the provision of WSS, and limited in-country&#13;
    experience in public-private partnerships for providing WSS;&#13;
· Dispersed, and often obsolete, norms and regulations for provision of WSS, limiting the ability to&#13;
    scale up the provision of sustainable WSS;&#13;
· Sector agencies with limited funds for WSS monitoring and evaluation;&#13;
· Weak coordination between government, civil society, and cooperation agencies in defining long-&#13;
    term strategies for the WS sector; and,&#13;
· Civil society has low understanding and support to water sector modernization because of a lack of&#13;
    solid communication and information systems.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Despite the major challenges described, opportunities do exist. Both countries have&#13;
prepared comprehensive PRS aligned with the WSS MDGs. Multilateral and bilateral financial and&#13;
cooperation agencies have fully engaged in contributing to assist governments in the implementation of&#13;
their PRSs. As a result, both countries are in the early stages of preparing SWAps for water and&#13;
sanitation. Honduras in particular has established a sector water board, comprised of government, civil&#13;
society, and cooperation agencies. In parallel, increased participation from civil society is steadily&#13;
shifting to address the sector's issues and long-term goals. Nicaragua has also requested support to WSP-&#13;
LAC and SDC to discuss experiences and define a roadmap to develop a SWAP for water.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC's Role: The Program's role in Honduras and Nicaragua involves:&#13;
· Contributing to sector and policy modernization, promoting the increase in coverage and quality of&#13;
    WSS services to the most poor, and promoting creation/scaling up of financial models and project&#13;
    strategies to increase long- term sustainability of WSS in rural areas and small towns;&#13;
· Contributing to the management and sharing of knowledge at country and regional levels, strengthening&#13;
    national and regional networks, as well as regional organizations such as FOCARD. Contributing to&#13;
    scaling up sustainable WSS services, focusing on knowledge transfer to local governments capabilities,&#13;
    and capacity building of key stakeholders at country and regional levels; and&#13;
· Contributing to the strengthening of WSP-LAC's local partners and clients for increased sector&#13;
    participation in meeting the MDG goals, implementing WSP-LAC's client-driven strategies in close&#13;
    coordination with local partners and financiers, and increasing the participation of local water and&#13;
    sanitation networks, as a discussion forum for sector challenges and goals.&#13;
&#13;
WSP- LAC's Comparative Advantage: Since the opening of its hub office in Honduras in February 2003,&#13;
WSP-LAC has increased its regional recognition by governments and donors, as an experienced institution&#13;
in knowledge management and technical assistance for the implementation of sector policies and innovative&#13;
technologies for the provision of WSS.         The Program's position within the sector in Honduras and&#13;
Nicaragua is strengthened by its access to global knowledge networks, inside and outside WSP.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC's Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-LAC will continue to focus on Honduras and Nicaragua,&#13;
where activities will be oriented to support the decentralization, the access of the urban poor to quality&#13;
water and sanitation services, and improving the access to sanitation services. In addition, effort will be&#13;
given to support the regional activities in CA by working with RRAS-CA and FOCARD.                    The&#13;
intervention strategy will also look to learn from South America and global experiences strategies to&#13;
reach MDGs. Specifically the Program will continue to build on sector and policy modernization by&#13;
supporting the socialization of the new WSS Law, assisting the implementation of the National Plan of&#13;
Water and Sanitation, strengthening the WS institutional capacity of CONASA to norm and FHIS&#13;
implementation models in Honduras. Similar work will be done in Nicaragua by providing TA to the&#13;
preparation of CONAPAS strategy for the WSS and a roadmap to develop a SWAP for the water sector.&#13;
In this effort the link and coordination with the "Donors Table" to finance government work plans will be&#13;
key. Support decentralization in Honduras and Nicaragua, by promoting the adoption of new innovative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             61&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Latin America/Caribbean                                                                   FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
management models in small tows and rural communities, to improve quality and sustainability of water&#13;
and sanitation services. Assist both countries in the development of a strategy to reach the urban poor&#13;
with quality water and sanitation services, in close alliance with SANAA and ENACAL and donors that&#13;
are funding projects to peri-urban neighborhoods. Continue to promote access to quality sanitation&#13;
services and the adoption of low cost technology, such as condominial water systems and biofilters,&#13;
looking at the impact on health through hygiene education practices.            Continue to build on the&#13;
strengthening of WSP-LAC's local partners and clients for increased sector participation in meeting the&#13;
MDG goals, including participation of WSP-LAC in Honduras's Water and Sanitation Sector Board,&#13;
contributing to RASNIC, GC, and RRASCA's communication strategies and knowledge sharing efforts&#13;
for meeting the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Peru&#13;
The Challenge: Peru also faces severe challenges in alleviating the extreme poverty that affects a wide&#13;
segment of its population. It is true that in the economic sphere Peru is better off than most of its&#13;
neighbors - it is growing and its currency is strong, but the differences between those who have access to&#13;
basic services and those who do not is dramatic. The current Peruvian government, now in its second&#13;
year, has to create urgent solutions to reduce this gap and improve the Peruvian people's standard of&#13;
living. The legal framework of the WSS sector is incomplete and Law 26338 must be adapted to the new&#13;
political organization of the country, within the decentralization process. The sector's main challenges&#13;
are the following:&#13;
· Develop a strategy oriented on users' demand in urban and rural areas;&#13;
· Promote a campaign to educate poor users in peri-urban areas on their rights and responsibilities&#13;
    regarding WSS provision;&#13;
· Improve low water coverage in urban and rural areas, currently at 87% and 60%, respectively;&#13;
· Improve low sewerage and latrine coverage in urban and rural areas, currently at 89% and 40%,&#13;
    respectively;&#13;
· Attract private investment to the sector. The investment budget required to implement sustainable&#13;
    services during the next five years, is estimated to be US$5 billion;&#13;
· Develop a strategy on wastewater treatment and environment protection; less than 10% of wastewater&#13;
    receives adequate treatment; and&#13;
· Develop an integral policy for management of water resources for human consumption and promoting&#13;
    education on health and hygiene.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Nevertheless, the country presents some opportunities for positive change. First, the&#13;
long-awaited process of decentralization has already begun, and local governments have new facilities at&#13;
regional and local levels. There is also political commitment to create solutions to the WSS crisis. The&#13;
government has started a new project, PRONASAR, designed to provide sustainable WSS to rural areas.&#13;
In Lima's metropolitan area, the water firm SEDAPAL implements a project oriented to include peri-&#13;
urban areas in its coverage, using an innovative participatory strategy. Finally, at the institutional level,&#13;
the Committee on Sector Coordination, in collaboration with Agencies of Cooperation and sector&#13;
authorities, has strengthened its scope of action and will soon expand to the national level.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC's Role: WSP-LAC will continue to support sector reform by providing technical assistance to&#13;
regulatory institutions in order to create awareness of the need to include small towns and rural areas in&#13;
new sector policies. It will also provide policy makers with its experiences and lessons learned in the&#13;
field, in Peru as in other Latin American countries, for them to be adapted to the country's reality.&#13;
&#13;
The following are some of WSP-LAC's main activities for this coming year:&#13;
· strengthen coordination strategies among sector actors and support regional participation;&#13;
· support sustainable investments through technical assistance to PRONASAR; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              62&#13;

Latin America/Caribbean                                                                 FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· implement experience systematization and dissemination efforts of successful and innovative&#13;
    experiences on issues such as gender equity, environment protection, health and sanitation education&#13;
    promotion, and non-conventional methodologies, among others.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC's Comparative Advantage: In Peru, WSP-LAC has extensive experience in sector knowledge&#13;
and experience systematization at rural and peri-urban levels. This background has allowed WSP-LAC's&#13;
technical assistance to regulatory authorities to incorporate rural and peri-urban areas by means of non-&#13;
conventional methods of WSS provision, as well as the proposal of major sustainable investments.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC's Strategic Activity Selection: This coming year WSP-LAC will develop activities in the&#13;
following areas:&#13;
· Rural WSP-LAC will support the regulatory institution in the formulation of policies oriented to&#13;
    ensure sustainability in WSS and community participation. It will provide technical assistance to&#13;
    PRONASAR and to the pilot project PROPILAS, and will systematize lessons learned in the process&#13;
    as well as conduct studies on native population and communities of the lower Amazon jungle.&#13;
· Peri-urban WSP-LAC will promote non-conventional technologies, especially condominial systems,&#13;
    and will support studies to identify the poorest segments of the population that do not have access to&#13;
    WSS in order to propose specific strategies.&#13;
· Small towns WSP-LAC, in collaboration with CIDA, will start Phase One of a three-year pilot&#13;
    project. Studies will be conducted to evaluate users' payment capacity and will support three&#13;
    municipalities in service rehabilitation by means of a new management model.&#13;
· Gender equity WSP-LAC will promote the necessity of including gender equity as a main issue in&#13;
    dissemination events as well as in PRONASAR. WSP-LAC will support the application of the global&#13;
    initiative to promote handwashing through public-private partnerships in Peru.&#13;

                                               SOUTH ASIA&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: South Asia has found it difficult to progress towards the WSS MDG, and in fact coverage&#13;
has declined in many areas. No city in the region has 24 hour water supply, while arsenic contamination&#13;
and poor maintenance hamper access in rural areas. The key problems are institutional, not technical or&#13;
financial. Service providers are not accountable to customers, incentives favor capital works projects&#13;
rather than sustainable service delivery, and subsidies do not benefit the poor. Inadequate knowledge and&#13;
lack of systematic policy reform mean change mostly occurs by stealth, and not on scale.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities: The institutional constraints to WSS delivery are beginning to be recognized, which offers&#13;
opportunities for WSP-SA to support the necessary reforms.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's Role: WSP-SA's core message is that it is not the pipes that need fixing, but the institutions.&#13;
Advocacy, advisory services and knowledge sharing on water and sanitation projects in isolation cannot&#13;
achieve this on scale. WSP-SA therefore engages at different levels ­ from region-wide knowledge&#13;
sharing to supporting national policy reform, to working with sub-national clients and partners on strategy&#13;
design and the development of fiscal financing mechanisms conducive to service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's Comparative Advantage: WSP-SA is uniquely positioned as an honest broker in the WSS&#13;
sector without a political, lending or bottom-line agenda and with rapid and flexible access to the joint&#13;
knowledge of donor organizations and international expertise.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-SA is currently active in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. To make an&#13;
impact on scale, WSP-SA has organized its work around themes and programs, at three levels. Although&#13;
related to each other, they make it possible to focus on the key areas of impact. First, from a water and&#13;
sanitation perspective, WSP-SA helps shaping effective relations between levels of government, supported&#13;
by appropriate policies. Second, with operational challenges in the WSS sector as an entry point, it helps&#13;
building sub-national institutions that deliver services responsive to customer demand, especially to the&#13;
needs of the poor. Third, in fiscal year 2006 concerted efforts will be made to develop and strengthen&#13;
regional linkages and programs across South Asia, possibly including Sri Lanka, to facilitate policy&#13;
dialogue and knowledge sharing about WSS management and its broader institutional requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Key activities: With its emphasis in catalyzing institutional change on scale for more efficient and&#13;
accountable water delivery, WSP-SA will:&#13;
· Help build a critical mass of informed WSS stakeholders across South Asia;&#13;
· In Bangladesh, build on community-based projects to support the introduction of new water&#13;
    management institutions.&#13;
· In India, assist reform of national urban policy and fiscal relations reform as well as of urban and&#13;
    rural water and sanitation service providers;&#13;
· In Pakistan, support water service institutions within the new decentralized system;&#13;
&#13;
Bangladesh&#13;
The Challenge: Bangladesh's formal policy aims are to ensure universal access to WSS services at an&#13;
affordable cost by 2010, five years before the global MDG target. However, in rural areas, widespread&#13;
arsenic contamination has forced a revision of reported water coverage (through handpumps) from 97 to&#13;
76%, and sanitation coverage is a mere 40%. In urban areas, coverage is lower and service providers&#13;
have been unable to respond effectively to the challenges of rapid urbanization, urban density, and the&#13;
growth of slums. Unaccounted-for water losses occur on a large scale, and in some slum areas a mere&#13;
14% of households have sanitary latrines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                 68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
South Asia                                                                                   FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Community-based initiatives have often proved the only way of overcoming the institutional constraints&#13;
to delivering water to local communities. State delivery systems are centralized, bureaucratic, unclear&#13;
about their role and not accountable to local users. Local government institutions (pourashavas) have&#13;
legal responsibility for delivery of water supply and sewerage and solid waste removal, but lack the&#13;
necessary financial and human resources and technical and managerial skills. Despite official policy&#13;
commitments to the contrary, users of services are largely excluded from decision-making and planning,&#13;
and success is measured mainly in terms of physical infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities: The arsenic crisis and public concerns about bacterial and fecal contamination have raised&#13;
awareness of the need for institutional change. This opens opportunities to scale up community-based&#13;
sanitation and local WSS service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's Role: WSP-SA's advisory services targets innovative WSS local-level pilots to stimulate&#13;
national policy dialogue and knowledge sharing and mobilize expertise.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's Comparative Advantage: Its presence in the country, supported by a strong regional team,&#13;
positions WSP-SA to support policy reform and institutional change based on lessons from ground level&#13;
WSS pilot projects, and to advise international and domestic agencies.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's Strategic Activity Selection: Building on the existing strategy, 2005-06 activities are geared to&#13;
support community-based locally-focused service delivery models, supported by knowledge sharing and&#13;
appropriate national policies. In rural areas, existing projects are used to explore service delivery options&#13;
and decentralization, and sharpen the focus on financing and expenditure management. Urban projects are&#13;
entry points to help build institutions to tackle delivery challenges in high density low income environments.&#13;
&#13;
For sanitation, WSP-SA will continue supporting the GoB in institutionalizing the total sanitation&#13;
campaign and subsequently scaling it up. To assist the GoB, WSP-SA have been working with the Plan&#13;
Bangladesh and Dhaka (Plan BD) Ahsania Mission to launch a local government-based pilot project on&#13;
promoting sanitation, building on the successful Community Led Total Sanitation model. The project&#13;
supports: i) development of an upazilla-based model of total sanitation steered by the Union Parishad,&#13;
with implementation in six selected upazillas, ii) development of local resources and skills and&#13;
enhancement of local government capacity, and iii) dissemination of learning from the experience with&#13;
the government and other partners so that the model can assist the GoB in implementing countrywide&#13;
programs for eradicating open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
Key projects:&#13;
· In rural areas, innovation is supported through Local Government based Community WSS Services,&#13;
    while Measuring Impact of Total Sanitation and Institutionalizing Performance are key vehicles to&#13;
    consolidate performance improvement through benchmarking and monitoring.&#13;
· Urban Utility Reform provides the entry point for institutional innovation, performance enhancement&#13;
    and alternative WSS service options on a city-wide basis.&#13;
&#13;
India&#13;
The Challenge: India has committed itself to 100% WSS coverage by 2007, eight years before the MDG&#13;
targets. However, while this promise has driven new investment (e.g., under the Accelerated Rural Water&#13;
and Sanitation Program) past investments have been poorly maintained. Even worse off than the rural&#13;
areas, no Indian city or town has 24 hour, 7 days/week water supply.&#13;
&#13;
Systemic reform in governance and service delivery is required. Although the Constitution designates&#13;
authority for WSS to the local level, supply remains centrally-driven ­ in rural areas through State level&#13;
government departments and in urban areas through water utilities, neither of which is accountable to their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
clients. The fiscal system mainly entails central-to-state-to-local transfers, but volatility in the annual&#13;
release of funds and weak policies and performance incentives discourage local-level multi-year planning&#13;
and retard the quality of services, such as WSS, and economic development. In response, GoI's National&#13;
Urban Renewal Mission (NURM) announced in 2005 aims to provide fiscal incentives to state and city&#13;
governments for urban sector reform. And demand responsive, community led rural programs initiated in&#13;
1999 and scaled up in 2002 under the Swajaldhara program, is now supported by a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding (MoU) model that sets a central framework for states to choose their strategy and access&#13;
fiscal incentives.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities: The NURM presents an opportunity to advocate policy and institutional reform at different&#13;
levels to support sustainable WSS service delivery. Local governments are also under increasing regulatory&#13;
and public pressure to address their shortcomings in solid waste management. Progress with state sector&#13;
assessments and the demand-led rural sanitation strategy in pilot districts of Maharashtra can be&#13;
consolidated to support policy change and improved implementation.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's Role: WSP-SA engages and advises policy makers on policy reform and implementation across&#13;
the WSS sector, but it also uses local pilot projects as a basis from which to inform reforms of local and&#13;
intergovernmental systems and incentives.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's Comparative Advantage: WSP-SA is able to provide technical advice on institutional and policy&#13;
change from a WSS service delivery point of view. Being unencumbered by a lending or other external&#13;
agenda lends it credibility.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's Strategic Activity Selection: Activities will seek to support the new reform momentum in the&#13;
urban sector, further state sector transformation policies and plans, and take forward the agendas on&#13;
performance enhancement (through M&amp;E and benchmarking), demand-led rural sanitation strategies and&#13;
solid waste management.&#13;
&#13;
Key Projects: Given these strategic opportunities, the key projects in India will be:&#13;
· The principal urban project is working with the GoI to take the NURM forward, especially enhancing&#13;
    fiscal incentives for local WSS service delivery (This includes consolidating and applying the&#13;
    findings of rapid city assessments done in 2004-05).&#13;
· In rural context, State Sector Assessments lay the ground for WSS sector transformation and the&#13;
    message from the Demand-Led Rural Sanitation pilots in Maharashtra is to be tested more widely.&#13;
    Solid Waste management is another priority.&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan&#13;
The Challenge: Despite adequate availability of treated water, no city in Pakistan provides a continuous&#13;
(24 hours a day, 7 days a week) water supply. In Pakistan's cities, towns and rural areas, a history of&#13;
centralized, supply-driven infrastructure extension has limited sustained access to services. Low quality&#13;
and coverage of service imposes heavy financial, health and environmental costs, especially on poor&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
The creation of a local government tier in 2001, dedicated to municipal services, has highlighted the need&#13;
to support decentralization of W&amp;S responsibilities by enhancing the political and operational&#13;
accountability of service providers. While decentralization may leverage this institutional shift, the&#13;
outcome is not assured.        Issues of intergovernmental fiscal and administrative decentralization,&#13;
institutional form and local capacity, and the accountability and role of service providers remain critical.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities: The experience of the decentralization process offers useful lessons for scaling-up reforms&#13;
across cities, towns and rural areas in Pakistan. In addition, integrated water management has emerged as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 70&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
South Asia                                                                            FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a priority socio-economic and political issue between the provinces and the federation. Donors are&#13;
beginning to respond to the decentralization initiative and emerging W&amp;S issues. Budgetary support to&#13;
the federal and provincial governments on decentralization and WSS sector investments is poised to&#13;
improve.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's role: WSP-SA uses its strong technical capacity on decentralized services and its extensive&#13;
global, regional and local networks to localize learning and its credibility as an honest broker to link&#13;
policy work to local level pilots and innovation.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA's Comparative Advantage: WSP-SA's strategic focus on institutional issues and access to&#13;
global knowledge positions it well when iterative work ­ piloting, sector work, bringing in global and&#13;
regional expertise, informing large donor investments ­ is required. WSP-SA's involvement in the design&#13;
of the new local government ordinance and support to the government under transition has strengthened&#13;
its position in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-SA will continue supporting the establishment of systems for&#13;
decentralized WSS service delivery through refinement of policy and legislation for fiscal and functional&#13;
decentralization; knowledge management to help scaling up delivery capacity of local governments and&#13;
service providers; and helping to build downward accountability to enhance performance of local level&#13;
policy makers and service providers.&#13;
&#13;
Key Projects: The forthcoming year will see WSP-SA begin to move to scale in its support of&#13;
decentralized service delivery reforms in Pakistan, through four key projects:&#13;
· Assistance in the evolution of the intergovernmental fiscal and administrative framework for local&#13;
    service delivery, and managing the risks of decentralization;&#13;
· Scaling-up of capacity enhancement strategies piloted in DI Khan across the NWFP and Pakistan&#13;
    more broadly, though support to IFI lending programs;&#13;
· Support to urban water supply authorities in the design and implementation of reforms to enhance&#13;
    political and operational accountability.&#13;
· Enhancing voice and client power in local service delivery, to strengthen downward accountability to&#13;
    consumers and citizens.&#13;

                                         GLOBAL PRACTICE TEAMS&#13;
&#13;
Background and main responsibilities: In an innovative effort to address its desire for: (a) more cross-&#13;
regional work, (b) building a global vision and leadership in WSS topics; (c) enhanced knowledge&#13;
generation, sharing and influence on the Bank and other IFIs; and (d) rapid cross-fertilization and&#13;
enhanced support to the regions, WSP has established a range of Global Practice Teams (GPTs). GPTs&#13;
are virtual teams of WSP experts in a given subject area/topic that will: (a) take the lead in generating&#13;
knowledge and thinking in specific thematic areas, (b) ensure quality enhancement of all WSP products,&#13;
(c) be the thematic interlocutors with the Bank and other IFIs, (d) catalyze cross-regional actions,&#13;
engagement with the Bank and other IFIs; and (e) mentor staff. In this formative stage, the GPTs will&#13;
seek to influence knowledge and learning of the WB through: (a) intensive WSP learning and policy&#13;
support in focus countries, (b) global replication of lessons and active participation and leadership in the&#13;
various Thematic Groups, Networks, and sectors; (c) cross support (and reverse cross support from the&#13;
Bank to WSP); and; (d) ensure real time application of global practice in the 106 countries in which the&#13;
WB is supporting WSS.&#13;
&#13;
Types of GPTs and Guiding principles: There are three types of GPTs: (a) core, to address strategic&#13;
thematic areas that are considered important for the next three years; (b) innovation/incubation, which are&#13;
experimental and short term to help us determine whether to mainstream them or conclude their work; (c)&#13;
support functions such as Resource Management, communications and ACS. The overriding principle of&#13;
the GPTs is that their activities and especially their products must be relevant and have impact in our&#13;
clients' and partners' activities in policy and institutional reform, investments, and practices. GPT work&#13;
programs will therefore have country-based activities but with a global learning scope and vision.&#13;
Leadership will be provided by WSP staff with particular expertise in specific thematic areas and with&#13;
leadership skills to steer the GPTs to achieve their objectives. While leadership of the GPTs remains with&#13;
WSP, they will have access to the best expertise available in their respective topics to ensure production&#13;
of high impact products.&#13;
&#13;
Operationalizing the GPTs: WSP has already established 5 core GPTs3 on Communications, Finance,&#13;
Rural, Sanitation and Hygiene, and Urban based on intensive discussions with the regions to identity the&#13;
main strategic thematic areas in which we are likely to have impact. The intensive regional consultation&#13;
was an important step to arrive at a common understanding of the strategic role, potential and direction of&#13;
the GPTs, gain broad support and gauge initial interest from staff and tap into their ideas on how best to&#13;
operationalize the GPTs. Staff: (a) agreed on a list of GPT coordinators responsible for operationalizing&#13;
the GPTs, "marketing" the various themes and expanding membership as well as making the case for&#13;
support to the PMT; and (b) guided the initial thinking on areas that the respective GPTs should focus as&#13;
well as preparation of the work plan and delivery strategy. Feedback five months since establishment&#13;
shows a positive trend in which regions are looking beyond their own geographic areas to engage in&#13;
thematic discussions, share various outputs/documentation. This positive start gives a strong signal to the&#13;
PMT of the potential that GPTs have and gives them confidence to move forward in a significant manner&#13;
by having each develop a fully fledged work plan covering its strategy, activities learning plans and&#13;
funding. The following sections detail the respective GPT work plans.&#13;
&#13;
Communications GPT&#13;
The Challenge: Tackling WSS challenges calls for new ways of maximizing the potential of&#13;
communication interventions to support sector reforms, capacity building of clients, and knowledge&#13;
generation and dissemination. For WSP, the challenge lies in how to assist its clients to make the most&#13;
from strategic, professionally-managed information, advocacy and behavior-change programs in order to&#13;
&#13;
3GPTs were established in December 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                    79&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Global                                                                                 FY06 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
effectively influence and impact on technical and reform projects. This is so because success in policy&#13;
reform, knowledge building, investment support and advocacy activities heavily depend on effective&#13;
communications, particularly since these tend to be complex, involve political risk and require social&#13;
change. At the local and national level, not enough has been done to build political goodwill, acceptance&#13;
and support for WSS sector reforms; all critical to the successful design and implementation of any&#13;
reform process. Many country clients also lack the communications capacity to build and sustain the&#13;
momentum of reforms and mitigate any possible political risks. As a learning organization focused on&#13;
improving the value of knowledge for the water and sanitation sector, WSP must continue to deliver&#13;
appropriate and quality knowledge products and services, and to ensure that the knowledge-value chain is&#13;
properly managed.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities: There is now increasing appreciation in the (traditionally technically-oriented) water&#13;
supply and sanitation sector that the challenge of achieving the MDGs requires a significant increase in&#13;
the quantity and quality of communications - especially relating to aspects such as reform advocacy,&#13;
public participation and consumer information and behavior-change programs. WSP has been providing&#13;
technical assistance for the development and implementation of reform communication strategies (Kenya&#13;
- Africa), and strengthening the capacities of country clients to manage communication on sector/utility&#13;
reforms (India, Zambia and Peru ­ SA, Africa and LAC). WSP has also been supporting initiatives to&#13;
sustain policy dialogue and providing communication support to national/local level sector institutions&#13;
(Mozambique, Uganda and Indonesia (Africa and EAP) as well as learning networks (RWSN).&#13;
Currently, there is increasing demand from WSP partners and clients to boost their capacities for strategic&#13;
reform communications, and also to support communication and advocacy interventions that respond to&#13;
WSS challenges. These demands present a new and exciting opportunity for the WSP Global Practice&#13;
Team on Communications to consolidate its current approaches into a strategic communication program&#13;
that can increase its impact and influence on sector reform processes. Strategic communication can be an&#13;
effective management tool to initiate and sustain a dialogue on the necessary reforms among a broad&#13;
stakeholder spectrum. For example, it can raise consumer awareness on the costs of the reform and&#13;
overcome the widespread belief that water is a public free good. By addressing potentially unpopular&#13;
measures in a frank, culturally sensitive and timely manner, a strategic communications campaign can&#13;
help maintaining political and societal commitment for the reform in its more difficult stages. In addition&#13;
to its socio-political risk mitigation role, strategic communication has proven to be an effective tool to&#13;
design and implement programs in a transparent and participatory manner.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global's Role: WSP will work with country clients to build their capacities to implement strategic&#13;
reform communication approaches, and also coordinate with partners at the country, regional, and global&#13;
levels to focus on supporting country sector dialogues on WSS issues and capacity building of WSS&#13;
communication practitioners. Managing the knowledge-value chain will require improved production,&#13;
dissemination and evaluation of knowledge and advocacy tools. WSP-Africa will further review&#13;
communication work practices that ensure consistency and quality of knowledge products, and also&#13;
leverage feedback from clients/partners to improve the effectiveness of communication tools.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global's Comparative Advantage: WSP is respected as an independent and credible source of&#13;
knowledge in the water and sanitation sector. WSP further derives its comparative advantage from its&#13;
proactive engagement with country clients, and long experience in knowledge management and advocacy&#13;
at regional and global levels. A strong field presence and communications expertise in pioneering work in&#13;
strategic reform communications ensure that WSP is demand responsive and able to work within local&#13;
realities.&#13;
&#13;
Key Activities:&#13;
· Building communication capacities of institutions in WSS&#13;
· Sustaining policy dialogue&#13;

Finance GPT&#13;
The Challenge: Financing is often portrayed as a key challenge in meeting WSS MDGs. Conventionally,&#13;
finance is viewed as determining sources of funds for infrastructure investments and many global&#13;
estimates of finance requirements point to large funding gaps in public resources. The early emphasis on&#13;
private sector investments has now shifted to pleas for more aid resources. Recent reports by the&#13;
Camdessus Panel and the UN Millennium Project both reflect this. While additional financing for the&#13;
sector will be required to meet the MDGs, this is clearly not sufficient. The main challenge is also to&#13;
build country capacities to respond to ensure a greater focus on efficiency and effectiveness in the use of&#13;
resources in the sector to make rapid, but sustainable progress.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The main opportunities arise from the ongoing work in countries, both to draw&#13;
lessons and to facilitate country-owned processes for improved systems in two main areas of strategic&#13;
importance:&#13;
    Emerging emphasis on `aid effectiveness' and sector governance.              The quality of governance&#13;
    arrangements and processes are generally held to be the key factors for improving efficiencies and&#13;
    development effectiveness in the use of financial resources. Action is needed on:&#13;
        Decentralization and fiscal framework ­ a) development of fiscal mechanisms to provide the&#13;
        `right incentives' in the context of decentralization, and b) design of inter governmental transfers&#13;
        system including conditional versus consolidated grants and design of special funds.&#13;
        Public financial management ­ a) development of properly costed `sector programs' and&#13;
        establishing clear links between reforms, strategy and public budgets, within Sectorwide&#13;
        approaches (SWAp), and b) strengthen country's own sector performance monitoring systems.&#13;
&#13;
    Leveraging resources and enhancing sustainability. While the emphasis on leveraging often stems&#13;
    from a realization of a limit on the availability of public resources, it focuses on internal generation of&#13;
    resources through user charges, with good revenue management to generate an operational surplus.&#13;
    This approach to leveraging also increases sustainability of services and creates a possibility of&#13;
    raising market based resources. To support this, action is needed both on demand and supply side&#13;
    approaches:&#13;
        Revenue management strategies ­ for improved cost recovery and expenditure management by&#13;
        autonomous water service providers,&#13;
        Improved design of subsidies ­ using output based and better targeted to avoid crowding out of&#13;
        service linked and local private resources,&#13;
        Facilitating domestic market borrowing ­ in selected countries by addressing supply side&#13;
        constraints (creating bankable opportunities) and promoting policy of `financing space'.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global's Role: Finance is a cross-cutting theme and receives attention in all the WSP regions and&#13;
themes. However, its global role is mainly seen as identifying lessons from its strong country presence&#13;
and thematic work, which will form the basis for analytical work in the two main opportunities identified&#13;
above. It also includes establishing links with appropriate global initiatives by development partners.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global's comparative advantage: WSP's comparative advantage is its ability to draw on its work&#13;
with country governments spanning four regions to develop a pool of global knowledge distilled from&#13;
country experiences. Such global analysis and inter-regional synthesis would feed back into more&#13;
effective country support. Also, since it is housed within the World Bank, WSP is able to work in&#13;

coordination with the Bank's operations, relevant thematic groups (such as PEMTG and RWSTG), and&#13;
other global programs (such as GPOBA and Cities Alliance). Its ongoing /proposed ties with regional&#13;
entities (such as NEPAD and AMCOW in Africa, or SAFIR in South Asia) as well as partnership with&#13;
key civil society/ private initiatives (such as WaterAid, SPARC, SEWA Bank, IED and K-Rep Bank)&#13;
would also enable it to disseminate and support use of the global knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global Strategic Activity Selection: The Finance Global Practice Team will lead the work to&#13;
provide leadership in critical areas. The work program focuses on a synthesis of lessons and experiences&#13;
from country level support in WSP regions through activities in the two focus areas:&#13;
         Influencing the use of improved public financial management practices and tools to increase&#13;
         development effectiveness in the use of sector (domestic and aid) resources&#13;
         Influencing the use of WSS related public /donor resources to leverage additional local/ domestic&#13;
         resources for WSS and increase sustainability of WSS services&#13;
&#13;
This will be done through specific products based on:&#13;
         Mapping of WSP and other global experiences within a defined conceptual framework&#13;
         Analysis and synthesis of WSP experiences in country support in the two focus areas&#13;
         Sharing of global synthesis and analysis in the two focus areas through appropriate&#13;
         communication products, participation in experience sharing events and inter-regional&#13;

Rural Water Supply and Sanitation GPT&#13;
The Challenge: Of the more than 1 billion people still lacking safe WSS, about 80% are found in rural&#13;
areas. Meeting the MDGs will therefore depend to a significant degree on the extent to which WSS&#13;
services reach the large rural populations that are currently unserved. Business as usual is unlikely to&#13;
make a significant difference in a sector that is characterized by high failure rates; low cost recovery; low&#13;
or stagnant rates of increase in coverage; and few sustainable options for service operation, maintenance&#13;
and management. New thinking, innovative strategies and approaches are needed to raise the profile of&#13;
RWSS, attract more investment resources, identify and elaborate expanded management and financing&#13;
models and partnerships to ensure sustainable management and to scale up provision. Many countries are&#13;
in the process of developing MDG action plans and are actively looking at ways to scale up RWSS&#13;
services provision but are hampered by institutional frameworks that are inadequate to support and sustain&#13;
the transition and resulting large scale investments. In addition, there has been limited analytical work&#13;
underpinning the transitions to large scale programs, weak capacity and systems for M&amp;E of RWSS&#13;
outcomes and impacts, and inadequate linkages with other sectors.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Relatively few management options have been attempted in RWSS where community&#13;
management has been the model of choice. Its limitations, especially in managing complex systems, are&#13;
emerging. Also emerging is the need for expanded management options that bring in new stakeholders&#13;
with superior technical, managerial and financial capacity including the domestic private sector. Another&#13;
factor is the global trend of decentralization where local governments are receiving greater responsibility&#13;
for service provision but in a background of unclear institutional roles, responsibilities and relationships&#13;
and inadequate capacity for RWSS program design, implementation, coordination and monitoring.&#13;
Finally, RWSS is increasingly being implemented through multi-sectoral projects/programs and seen in&#13;
its broader social context with potential to impact other MDG targets. RWSS provision therefore needs to&#13;
strengthen linkages with poverty reduction, health, gender, etc. This offers WSP-Global opportunities to&#13;
fill these key knowledge gaps that are fundamental to raising the profile of RWSS and sustainability of&#13;
large-scale investments.&#13;
&#13;

learning, advocacy and partnership and rapid exchange of information to bring the best global knowledge&#13;
to policy makers at local level.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global's Comparative Advantage: With its global-regional-national learning and implementation&#13;
links, long track record, high professional capacity and ability to maintain real-time contacts with key&#13;
decision makers, flexible access to international expertise, WSP-Global is uniquely qualified to carry out&#13;
this type of strategic knowledge generation, learning and influencing investments on the ground. The&#13;
recently established Rural Global Practice Team (RGPT), a community of RWSS experts, will lead this&#13;
work in addition to growing the RWSS practice to establish WSP's leadership in the sub-sector.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global Strategic Activity Selection: Based on the above challenges and opportunities, the global&#13;
RWSS strategy is organized around three inter-related pillars: (a) expanded options for sustainable scaling&#13;
up of ; (b) strengthened institutional linkages for RWSS provision by local governments and other local&#13;
institutions and processes; and; (c) placing RWSS services at the core of achievement of the WSS MDGs,&#13;
as well as impacting other objectives of poverty reduction, health, gender parity and establishing the inter-&#13;
relationship between RWSS and economic growth. The main categories of activities are: (i) global&#13;
learning advocacy and partnerships; (ii) conceptual framework, research and analytical work, models&#13;
tools and methods; and (iii) cross-regional, south- south fertilization. Knowledge generated from these&#13;
activities is expected to filter back and influence the way our clients plan, implement, and manage RWSS&#13;
services and ultimately, scale up to meet the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Key Projects: (i) options for an institutional framework for supporting and sustaining the transition to&#13;
sustainable large scale RWSS programs, (ii) RWSS service delivery and O&amp;M models and the interface&#13;
between local governments, private sector and communities, (iii) articulating the interrelationship&#13;
between RWSS and economic growth, poverty reduction, gender, and economic growth; and (iv)&#13;
International RWSS conference.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation and Hygiene GPT&#13;
The Challenge: To reach the global sanitation MDG, the rate of sanitation provision would have to&#13;
increase drastically to keep pace with population growth; such a dramatic increase in service provision&#13;
would still leave the absolute number without access the same. Achieving the global sanitation MDG&#13;
target will require sharp and continuous efforts in investments.&#13;
&#13;
It is unlikely that the global sanitation MDG target will be met. The vast majority of developing countries&#13;
will just manage to keep pace with the population increase. Sanitation matters mostly in high-density&#13;
areas where people cannot avoid unmanaged human wastes. The rapid growth of unplanned peri-urban&#13;
communities thus represents a daunting challenge for sanitation. The problem is not restricted to large&#13;
cities; small towns can have many of the same problems, but without the technical, institutional, and&#13;
legislative capacity that are frequently found in larger cities.&#13;
&#13;
The sanitation sector is characterized by institutional fragmentation.        It is not uncommon to have&#13;
sanitation responsibilities split between several ministries. Not only does this make sector policy difficult&#13;
to coordinate and manage, but it also means that sanitation is low on the individual agenda of each&#13;
ministry. This institutional fragmentation and low profile of the sector make it difficult to mobilize&#13;
resources and coordinate the various stakeholders involved in its development. Most of the approaches to&#13;
sanitation promotion have led to small islands of success.&#13;
&#13;
Conventional sanitation programs provide sanitation at subsidized prices and are constrained by the&#13;
limited size of the subsidy budget. Therefore sanitation promotion usually stops with the end of the&#13;
subsidies. Moreover, the subsidy is often captured by the better-off, who are better able to apply for it and&#13;
spend it. Untargeted subsidies tend to introduce distortions in the market and undermine efforts of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
domestic private sector, who are the suppliers of sanitation services and products to the poor segment of&#13;
the population.&#13;
&#13;
Technocratic sanitation programs tend to provide standardized model of sanitation. The engineering&#13;
design is generally based on developed country standards, which are sophisticated and expensive in&#13;
capital and operational costs. More and more on-site sanitation technologies. They simply exclude&#13;
unplanned areas. As there are generally different desires and that sanitation is a private household&#13;
decision, a standardized model cannot suit the various demands. In most of the cities of the developing&#13;
countries, the conventional sewerage network covers less than 40%, and the final disposal of the affluent&#13;
is poor and unhealthy with serious damages to the environment. The on-site sanitation products, which&#13;
constitute the solution for the majority of the population, have also negative potential impacts on the&#13;
environment and the human health. Few studies of the environmental externalities of on-site solutions&#13;
have been done.&#13;
&#13;
Scaling up innovative pilot strategies and programs will require a better understanding of constraints and&#13;
drivers of improved sanitation, and the cost-effectiveness of different sanitation promotion approaches.&#13;
In addition, sanitation does not only consist of providing toilets. Changes in hygiene behaviors are needed&#13;
to improve practices towards sustainable hygienic sanitation. Several hygiene techniques are&#13;
implemented, but very little is known about their cost-effectiveness and real impacts on behavior changes&#13;
on the long term.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the low priority that characterizes the sanitation and hygiene sectors leads also to poor knowledge&#13;
development and sharing to learn from best practices and accelerate sanitation and hygiene programs&#13;
delivery.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities: In most developing countries, Small Scale Independent Providers (SSIPs) are providing&#13;
the bulk of sanitation services and products. They are flexible to adapt products and services to the needs&#13;
and the capacity to pay of the poor segment of the population. They learn from the market and respond to&#13;
the demand. Even, the enabling environment (lack of recognition, limited access to finance, absence of&#13;
institutional support) for SSIPs intervention, the market offers an opportunity to accelerate sanitation&#13;
services and products delivery towards meeting the sanitation MDG target. WSP has gained substantive&#13;
knowledge about sanitation approach development. In the Africa region, WSP is rolling out sanitation&#13;
marketing4 programs after pioneering the strategic sanitation planning in the early 80s. On the hygiene&#13;
promotion side, WSP-AF has supported the implementation of the PHAST hygiene improvement&#13;
techniques in several countries, and assisting selected countries with the implementation of large scale&#13;
public-private partnership hand washing initiatives. In the Asia regions, WSP is supporting large&#13;
community-led total sanitation programs. In the Latin America region, WSP has pioneered the sanitation&#13;
condominium systems. All these approaches focus on demand simulation and aim to develop sustainable&#13;
sanitation and hygiene promotion programs. They all use to some extend the power of the market. But&#13;
there is a need to develop a comprehensive sanitation marketing approach that stresses the linkages of the&#13;
demand-side, the supply-side and the enabling environment. While commercial and social marketing&#13;
approaches offer tools and techniques for demand stimulation and supply improvement that need to be&#13;
adapted to the sector, the enabling environment requires further development to address issues related to&#13;
sanitation policies, sustainable financing (including subsidy policy), institutional arrangements, capacity&#13;
building, accountability, regulation, etc. Therefore, sanitation marketing goes beyond simply using the&#13;
power of the market, but addresses also the sector reform issues within the overall enabling environment&#13;
framework. In addition, WSP is facilitating sanitation networks in Africa (AfricaSan), Asia (SACoSan&#13;
and EacSan), and Latin America (LatinSan).&#13;

&#13;
WSP is supporting several countries roll-out public-private partnership for hand washing (PPP-HW)&#13;
programs for improved hygiene practices. Preliminary results are promising, but there is still a lot to learn&#13;
about the participation of the private sector, the long term impacts of the hygiene promotion campaigns&#13;
on behavior changes, the cost of scaling up, the linkages between hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
improvement, the institutional setting for long lasting impacts.&#13;
&#13;
Both PPP-HW and sanitation marketing use the power of the market and involve the private sector. PPP-&#13;
HW can be a leverage to stimulate sanitation and mainstreamed into sanitation marketing programs.&#13;
Stronger synergy will be developed with the WB sanitation and hygiene thematic group and the Global&#13;
PPP-HW coordination unit hosted by WSP-HQ.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global's role: WSP knowledge resources are country/region-specific. As a global program, WSP&#13;
should leverage lessons at country and regional levels to generate and share knowledge and tools,&#13;
promote cross-regional and global fertilization, and provide a platform for scaling up innovative&#13;
approaches and practices towards meeting the sanitation MDG and the WASH5 goal. Finally, WSP will&#13;
enhance the capacity of decision-makers and practitioners, and raise the profile of the sector by&#13;
facilitating a global sanitation network by building the linkages between the regional sanitation networks.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global's comparative advantage&#13;
 ·       Field presence in several countries.&#13;
 ·       Availability of knowledge resources base on sanitation promotion and support partners&#13;

Urban Water Supply and Sanitation GPT&#13;
The water and sanitation services for the urban poor GPT proposes basic areas of activities focused&#13;
around three platforms:&#13;
&#13;
1. The utility reform platform. A broad range of challenges include subsidies, targeting the poor,&#13;
    revenue management, expansion and densification of networks, roadmaps for institutional reform,&#13;
    service options for increasing access by the poor, asset ownership.&#13;
2. The local private provider platform. This platform is predominately focused on the modalities of&#13;
    linking small private providers to utilities, the transitions and interfaces that develop between the&#13;
    local private sector and utilities/municipalities, addressing SPP capacity constraints, mobilizing&#13;
&#13;
5The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All Campaign (WASH) is a concerted advocacy and communication&#13;
campaign to mobilize political awareness, support and action to end the suffering of 1.1 billion people without&#13;
access to safe water, and the 2.4 billion without adequate sanitation.&#13;

&#13;
   finance in the water marketplace, the complexities of regulation (standards and pricing) and so on.&#13;
   This area of work is closely associated with the DPSP Initiative.&#13;
3. The voice and client power platform. This platform is predominately focused on strengthening the&#13;
   role of the poor in demanding access to affordable services at service level they require.&#13;
   Strengthening both the voice relationship between the poor and government, and the client power&#13;
   relationship between the poor and the service provider is central to the sustainable improvement of&#13;
   services. Much work is needed to understand further the ingredients of successful initiatives in this&#13;

Client:                  Direction of Hydraulic (DH)&#13;
Country:                 Benin&#13;
Partners:                AFTU2, Danida, GTZ, DGDC, AFD, Dutch, KfW, and municipal authorities&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The expected outcome is the adoption by the GoB of an amended national WS strategy (including rural and urban) that&#13;
clarifies how the sector will achieve the WSS MDGs through the decentralization and PRSP processes.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Since the `90s WSP-AF, in partnership with AFTU2 and other stakeholders, has led the design of a water supply strategy&#13;
(PADEAR) and supported the DH undertake its implementation. The strategy, supported by WB and Danida investments, has boosted RWS&#13;
coverage. The main thrusts of the strategy are: (i) promotion of a demand-responsive approach, (ii) transfer of project operations from the DH to the&#13;
private sector, (iii) DH "deconcentration," (iv) DH focus on capacity building of the sectoral actors, channel financing for RWS, and support&#13;
contracting mechanisms. The strategy has been reviewed and updated, reflecting experience learned to date, the challenge of the MDGs, and the new&#13;
context of the decentralization. The DH launched the review process from late 2002, with conceptual support and advice from WSP-AF in the&#13;
management of various specific consultancies/studies. In partnership with the main external agencies, WSP-AF has, from Apr 03, contracted a&#13;
consultant to support the DH to accelerate the revision process. With WSP-AF's support, the strategy was reviewed and endorsed by the GoB and&#13;
stakeholders. WSP-AF will continue its support to the implementation of the strategy update focusing on the institutional aspects in the context of&#13;
decentralization. The strategy and the PRSP process will specifically align Benin's future rural challenge to the MDG targets and propose an&#13;
implementation plan. WSP-AF intends to play a leading role in: (i) support developing the supply chains aspects of the RWS strategy, and (ii) assist&#13;
in developing a communication action plan at the internal DH level and to improve the communication with all stakeholders involved in the RWS,&#13;
and (iii) support developing an urban water supply strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Continuing commitment of the GoB to pursue and implement decentralization policy&#13;
2.   Sufficient support capacity of local operators to support supply chain strategy and programs&#13;
3.   Sufficient support capacity of DH to facilitate the implementation of the communication strategy&#13;

Partners:                      UNDP, Project Coordination Team, AFD, SDC, and DANIDA&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The capacity of selected municipalities is enhanced in order to develop, implement, and monitor community-driven&#13;
environmental sanitation programs within the overall framework of achieving the WSS MDGs in Burkina Faso under the new decentralization&#13;
policy.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Within the decentralization context, this project aims to support municipal initiatives to implement pro-poor environmental&#13;
sanitation programs in selected towns. A project coordination unit has been set up with the financial support of UNDP under the leadership of the&#13;
Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization. UN volunteers have been recruited to assist the project's central coordination unit and&#13;
each of the six decentralized coordination units. These volunteers are the WSP-AF focal points for activity design, implementation, and supervision.&#13;
The project will assist 6 selected towns with the development of a pro-poor strategy to improve living and environmental conditions. The six urban&#13;
centers have 1,660,000 inhabitants representing over 65% of the urban population. Project activities include (i) training of local teams in six&#13;
municipalities, (ii) development of an operational manual and guidelines (budgeting, planning, eligibility criteria for project selection, funding&#13;
mechanisms, community contribution plan, implementation plan, tendering, supervision and monitoring, etc.), (iii) develop Municipal Action Plans&#13;
(MAPs) for attainment of WSS MDG targets, and (iv) support the community-driven development programs. The project also will enable WSP-AF&#13;
staff to assist local authorities of the six towns develop city-wide WSS MDG strategy and action plan (WSS MDG strategy, MDG action plan,&#13;
capacity needs assessment, financing and resources mobilization plan, monitoring and evaluation system). As WSP-AF is also supporting a WSS&#13;
MDG roadmap development at national level, this project will assist these 6 municipal councils better understand the MDG challenges and develop&#13;
MDG-based local development plans. These plans will include fundable micro-projects to improve living and environmental conditions in poor&#13;
settlements. Financial resources are expected from the HIPC basket, the French Development Agency urban project under preparation, the WB new&#13;
urban project under preparation, and other funding sources such as NGOs, bilateral donors, etc.&#13;

for increased financing of the sector and effective use of available resources, (iii) M&amp;E models used by all stakeholders to assess regularly progress&#13;
and update strategy and plans, and (iv) capacity enhancement to improve sector performance. A Country Sector Advisor will be recruited to support&#13;
the development of the sector and work in partnership with all key stakeholders [donor community (WB, DANIDA, Sweden, Netherlands, France,&#13;
etc.), NGO, national government, civil society, water and sanitation utility, private sector, etc.]. The project objectives are as follows: (i) To increase&#13;
sector coordination and leadership; (ii) To enhance sector performance and deliver targeted capacity building programs; (iii) To improve policy&#13;
dialogue through an effective consultative system and mainstream WSS into relevant development instruments (PRSP, MTEF, HIPC, etc.); (iv) To&#13;
sustain financing mechanisms and increase financial resources flows to the sector; (v) To support institutional development for the sector, including&#13;
reform of the national water and sanitation utility.&#13;

 Task Manager:            Madio Fall&#13;
 Client:                  Ministry of Energy &amp; REGIDESO (DRC water utility)&#13;
 Country:                 Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)&#13;
 Partners:                AFTU2, national sector agencies and COPIREP, Belgium, EU, AFD, GTZ/KFW&#13;
 Desired Project Outcome: The GoC adopts and begins implementing a coordinated sector approach based on coherent strategies involving&#13;
 structural reform and effective support to community managed water supply systems is well underway.&#13;
&#13;
 Project Description: The overall objective of the project is to assist DRC and its development partners in setting the foundation for accelerated&#13;
 development of WS services with particular attention to services to the poor. WSP-AF's program in DRC will be guided by the priorities defined by&#13;
 the multi-donor Round Table on Infrastructure (Oct 04). WSP-AF's support will be directed at three critical components of the work program of the&#13;
 SGTSEAU (the sectoral working group established by the Ministry of Energy to steer the reform of REGIDESO under a Bank supported Public&#13;
 Enterprises reform program coordinated by a dedicated project unit: COPIREP): A) Urban Reform: WSP-AF's role is one of facilitator and adviser&#13;
 to the Ministry of Energy and REGIDESO as well as key donors (primarily AFD, WB, and EU). In FY05 and FY06, WSP-AF will first support the&#13;
 development of urgent remedial measures to redress REGIDESO's operational capacity (commercial water metering, uncounted for water) and in a&#13;
 second phase the definition of options for structural reform starting with a thorough diagnostic. B) Community-Based Systems: Support will be a&#13;
 central tenet of DRC sector development strategy. The idea that DRC development will have to rely on local initiatives and community involvement&#13;
 will be at the heart of the PRSP. WSP-AF will help to develop effective strategies and support mechanisms for locally managed water supply&#13;
 systems. C) Sector Coordination: This will be critical for the transition from emergency rehabilitation to coherent strategy-based programs linked&#13;
 to well-defined objectives in terms of improvement and extension of water supply services. WSP-AF will follow a step by step approach leading to&#13;
 strategies and related programs by sub-sectors. WSP-AF country based staff will play a key role in facilitating sector coordination.&#13;
&#13;
 Assumptions:&#13;
 1.   Peaceful completion of the current political transition to democratic election leading to stable government.&#13;
 2.   Strengthening commitment to reform involving reliance on PPP and local initiatives.&#13;
 3.   Continued interest in WSS sector by donors.&#13;

Partners:                 AFTU1, BADC, ADC, DANIDA, BNWP, DFID, EU, NORAD, NGOs and UN family&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The expected outcome of this project is a clearly defined national implementation framework (including guidelines for&#13;
funding, M&amp;E and institutional arrangements) which is integrated in key government development programs (e.g. Health extension program) and&#13;
aims at sanitation and hygiene improvements at scale in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description:      Sanitation coverage in Ethiopia is likely to remain low unless drastic and comprehensive measures are taken to resolve the&#13;
underlying policy, legislative, institutional, and financial constraints. To enhance Ethiopia's chance of achieving the sanitation MDGs a national&#13;
sanitation coordination body will be created and a national sanitation strategy and protocol (with MDG-related targets) will be developed in close&#13;
consultation with sector ministries and stakeholders. The protocol will include institutional responsibilities, technology choices, and funding&#13;
mechanisms. Capacity assessment and resource flows studies for sanitation will be conducted too. Planning, implementation, and management&#13;
capacity of the MoH, MoWR, regional and woreda-level health &amp; water officers and other stakeholders will be enhanced through learning, networking.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Continued political commitment by Government and counterpart attention (appointed focal point officers) of MoH to support the process&#13;
2.   Sustained commitment of partners (donors, NGOs, UN family, civil society, etc) to support the process and to agree on a common approach&#13;
     (harmonization) to support sanitation and hygiene in the country&#13;
3.   IDA-supported WSS program signed and under implementation&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: Jul 03                                                   End Date: Jun 06&#13;

Partners:                Netherlands Govt., EUWI, Austria, Danida, DGDC, EU, DfID, Water Aid, UNICEF, WB (AFTU1), Italian Cooperation&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcomes:         A country-owned national WSS MDG Action Plan and financing strategy prepared based on MDG roadmaps&#13;
developed for the regional states, adopted and implemented by the government for achieving the WSS MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The overarching objective of Ethiopia's Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP) is to reduce&#13;
poverty by enhancing rapid economic growth while at the same time improving service delivery. Water and sanitation are among the key sectoral&#13;
measures and cross-cutting issues to be addressed. The SDPRP targets for the medium- and long-term are consistent with the MDGs. Due to the fact&#13;
that current water and sanitation coverage figures for Ethiopia are among the lowest on the continent the challenge is to try and rectify this situation&#13;
in order to meet the WSS MDGs within the next 11 years. However the clear commitment of the Government of Ethiopia to the MDGs provides a&#13;
real opportunity to develop a clear, phased, and realistic regional planning framework that aligns and accelerates existing plans towards achieving the&#13;
national WSS MDGs. At the national level, WSP-AF will mainly play a coordinating, lobbying, and advisory (e.g., quality assurance) role for the&#13;
ongoing development of MDG roadmaps for WSS as part of the EU Water initiative country dialogue with Ethiopia. WSP-AF will also support both&#13;
the GoE and the lead EU donor (DFID) to maximize the impacts of additional funding for the WSS through the EU Water Initiative. WSP-AF's&#13;
support will be mainly directed to support regional states in developing regional WSS roadmaps within the overall national MDG planning&#13;
framework. The planned support has to be seen in close conjunction with project EWDAF/ETH/41 and the planned complementary activities to the&#13;
roadmap developed can be summarized as follows:&#13;
     Support regional consultation to gain political commitment and promote adoption of the roadmap approach in the regions&#13;
     Commission rapid reviews on status of WSS in the regions&#13;
     Strengthen coordination at regional levels&#13;
     TA focusing on specific knowledge gaps (e.g.: financing strategy, Rolling investment plans, etc)&#13;
     Support the compilation of regular regional scorecard progress reports to encourage peer review and stimulating competition among the regions&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   WSP-AF gets mandated by GoE to support sector coordination and MDG roadmap development in the SCA agreement (to be signed in FY05)&#13;
2.   Increased focus on WSS national/regional priorities and commitment to implementation of national/regional MDG plans&#13;
3.   Regional states buy into the idea of developing regional WSSl roadmaps and build consensus among the Woredas to follow the implementation&#13;
     path specified in the roadmaps&#13;
&#13;

Indicators of Outcome:&#13;
1.   Budget and expenditure reports indicate public and donor funding channeled to priority areas under an agreed consistent framework increases by&#13;
     10% annually ­ starting from Jun 06 and measured up to Jun 08 annually&#13;
2.   GoE rolls out MDG roadmap nationally and begins implementation indicated by the fact that the budget for EY fiscal year 99 and activities&#13;
     planned are in coherence with the roadmap.(joint annual review)&#13;
3.   Growth in the annual WSS coverage figures (trend curves get steeper) , as collected by the JMP, indicate the achievability of the MDG goals ­&#13;

Partners:                 GTZ, KfW, AFD, and AFTU1&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Improved access to sustainable WSS services delivery strategy within informal settlements in large and medium sized&#13;
towns in Kenya through the adoption and implementation of MW&amp;I of a framework for the management of WSS services by alternative service&#13;
providers.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WSP-AF's urban work in Kenya has focused on the development of working models for delivery of WSS in informal&#13;
settlements. Within this broad framework, WSP-AF will continue the on-going dialogue on delivery mechanisms for WSS in informal settlements in&#13;
the large and medium sized urban centers. WSP-AF will support the scale up and implementation of WSS service delivery activities in informal&#13;
settlements. Project activities will focus on supporting the preparation, design, and implementation of a pilot informal settlement WSS project. It is&#13;
envisaged that this work will take place in Nairobi and another two urban centers. It will support the ongoing World Bank funded Nairobi Water and&#13;
Sewerage Institutional Restructuring (NWSIRP). Activities in other urban areas will be closely linked to support the investment projects under&#13;
preparation. Close links will be maintained with the WSP-AF Urban thematic team and lessons shared from the ongoing work in Kisumu. Issues to&#13;
be addressed include pricing, decentralization of service provision, and financing. In FY03 and FY04 the project focused on the development of&#13;
delivery mechanisms for WSS within informal settlements with a focus on Kibera, Nairobi and the preparation and support to an Informal settlement&#13;
water distribution infilling component by NCC which was unfortunately never completed. The newly formed Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company&#13;
however utilized the lessons and created a unit dedicated to improving service provision to Informal settlements.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Targeted investment project in Mombasa and Nakuru and WB Institutional Restructuring Project in Nairobi are approved and under&#13;
     implementation&#13;
2.   Commitment by the Water Service Boards (WSBs) and Water Service Providers (WSPs) to implement a pro poor focused delivery strategy&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Improved sector coordination and operationalization of the newly established sector institutions under the Water Act&#13;
2002 to ensure effective service delivery by supporting the ongoing water sector reform processes.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The Water Act (2002) was passed by parliament and two strategies on WSS service delivery and WRM have been finalized.&#13;
The Ministry has continued to implement reforms in the water sector in line with the Water Act 2002. Almost all the new institutions are in place&#13;
and are at different levels of operationalization. This activity will therefore: i) Support the overall sector coordination activities for WSS services,&#13;
keep up the dialogue among all major stakeholders and promote networking and learning; ii) Focus on institutional reforms and policies that affect&#13;
the poor, primarily supporting pro-poor concerns in the establishment of institutions for WSS services. In FY06 WSP-AF will continue to support&#13;
the operationalization of the Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) in the development of a strategic plan, business plan and a monitoring and&#13;
evaluation framework. The capacity of the WSBs will be enhanced to improve the quality of project proposals; iii) support the WSBs in&#13;
identification of their investment needs and preparation of the sector investment and financing plan. This will include helping the WSBs to identify&#13;
and capacity build different WSP options&#13;
&#13;
A communications strategy to enhance the reform process and improve advocacy for National Water Campaign has been developed and is in the&#13;
process of being implemented. The implementation of the communications strategy will ensure that environmental resources and service&#13;
management issues requiring positive attitude and behavior change are effectively communicated to all stakeholders. Networking and learning will&#13;
continue to be promoted by effectively communicating issues through the Kisima seminar series and newsletter. This will also promote engagement&#13;
and open debate among different sector actors and help the government discuss key issues in the reform process with stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.  Ongoing political commitment by Government to support the reform process&#13;
2.  Reliable budget and sustained resources for MW&amp;I to fund the reforms&#13;
3.  The WSTF will have the necessary funds to disburse to qualified proposals&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: Jul 03        End Date: Jun 06&#13;
&#13;
Indicators of Outcome:&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The development of a country owned national environmental sanitation and hygiene policy and implementation of a&#13;
national sanitation program to ensure the achievement of sanitation MDGs in Kenya&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WSP-AF has over the last few years been working together with other development partners (UNICEF, WHO) to support the&#13;
MoH in the preparation of a national environmental sanitation and hygiene policy. The policy is expected to clarify roles and mandates in order to&#13;
enhance the existing legal and institutional framework and guide the management and financing of sanitation services in Kenya to help the country&#13;
achieve the sanitation MDG. In FY05, the project focused on the finalization of the draft policy document, consultation and decision maker's&#13;
workshops and preparation of a memorandum for presentation to cabinet. The focus in FY06 will be on the development of a roadmap to achieve the&#13;
sanitation MDGs and the development of sanitation guidelines that address rural and informal settlement areas of urban areas. The policy will give&#13;
direction on how to structure the sub sector in order to massively expand existing preventive and promotive environmental health programmes to&#13;
achieve real and lasting behavior change and consequently expedite the coverage of improved sanitation facilities in a coordinated manner. The&#13;
implementation strategy will therefore include the development of a well-coordinated hygiene promotion component.&#13;
&#13;
The implementation of the national sanitation program developed under this project will do in collaboration with project EEWDAF/KEN/77 ­ The&#13;
development of WSS MDG roadmap in Kenya to ensure synergies in approach and avoid unnecessary duplication.&#13;

results in increased financial resources flows and improves the capacity and performance of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WSP-AF is committed to supporting client governments in meeting the WSS-MDG targets through (i) the promotion of sector&#13;
reforms and improved governance, (ii) support in developing sustainable financing policies, (iii) regional capacity building and knowledge networks&#13;
and (iv) through the development of strategies and programs for sub-sectors (rural, small towns, urban, sanitation and hygiene). WSP-AF is in the&#13;
process of assisting client countries develop and implement country-owned roadmaps to meet the WSS-MDGs. WSP-AF will help in about activities&#13;
related areas:&#13;
    Develop a detailed country owned WSS-MDG action plan for Kenya&#13;
    Support the development of a capacity building strategy for the WSS-MDGs&#13;
    Support the development of mechanisms through which partners and the client would facilitate investment in the sector&#13;
    Facilitate the formation and operationalization of a regional WSS-MDG initiative for knowledge and experience sharing&#13;
The review and development of work already completed will form the basis for the development of a consultative and all inclusive country-owned&#13;
WSS-MDG roadmap for Kenya.           As part of the road mapping process, a set of monitoring indicators will be developed and a strong monitoring&#13;
system set-up to ensure that the progress is effectively monitored and any quick response mechanisms put in place to ensure that the country is and&#13;
remains on track with respect to meeting the MDG goal. The capacity building strategy will be prepared and later launched to facilitate sustained&#13;
implementation. Cross country networking and learning, particularly for our partners would be effectively promoted. There will also be continuous&#13;
engagement among different actors.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The Mozambican Government introduces new service delivery mechanisms at the local level, and incorporates RWSS&#13;
lessons learned into the national policy framework, leading to accelerated coverage rates and increased sustainability of RWSS projects.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: GoM funds for rural water supply infrastructure implementation have not led to improved rates of execution or sustainability.&#13;
Only around 70% of the government's annual construction/rehabilitation targets have been met over the past two years, and the current approach to&#13;
reducing the non-functioning waterpoint rate is limited to physical rehabilitation activities which accounted for 40% of all "added" coverage in 2004.&#13;
At the same time, major decentralized RWSS projects are underway throughout the country, that purport to have developed improved&#13;
implementation modalities resulting in increased waterpoint sustainability, an increased rate of implementation, and greater household impact in&#13;
general. This projects aims to identify these specific best practices, document them, and widely disseminate the results of these projects, for eventual&#13;
incorporation into national policies. Both subject-specific studies and longer-term learning partnerships will be undertaken with selected partners, in&#13;
collaboration with CEDESA.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   CEDESA (Center for Strategic Water Studies) legally formed and fully financed.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Improved national and local planning processes, implementation, and performance monitoring for attaining the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Though Mozambique is signatory to the MDGs, little progress has been made to date on establishing appropriate and realistic&#13;
national plans, long-term targets, financing strategies, and a performance monitoring system for MDG follow-up. This project will assist the GoM in&#13;
achieving its own enunciated MDG goals, involving actions on several fronts, including planning, implementation, and performance monitoring&#13;
systems. The MDG roadmap will be developed in close partnership with several stakeholders, and lead eventually to a more participatory national&#13;
planning approach. Mozambique's new Center for Strategic Studies in Water (CEDESA) will function as the MDG information clearinghouse.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   CEDESA is legally formed during FY06&#13;
2.   GoM will pursue a participatory methodology in developing the MDG roadmap&#13;

Partners:                Mozambique's water sector Core Group, GAS members (National Water and Sanitation Working Group), CEDESA, other&#13;
                         NGOs and private sector companies.&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Increased sector actor awareness of on-going initiatives and activities, with participation by a wide range of stakeholders&#13;
(including NGOs, the private sector, donors, and international organizations), in a constructive dialogue on key themes and issues, resulting in&#13;
increased donor coordination, improved sector fund flows, and improved implementation mechanisms and results.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Networking and communications to take place through four instruments: (1) the Core Group, composed of six key sector&#13;
donors and the GoM, (2) the National Water and Sanitation Working Group (GAS), (3) a sector discussion series, and (4) regular WSP-AF&#13;
communications activities. The Core Group responds to the Program Aid Partnership which is monitoring the PRSP/budget support program. It&#13;
meets two to four times a year and performs the annual and mid-year assessment of sector activities. WSP participates in representation of the Bank.&#13;
GAS is one of three working groups established by GoM, and WSP-AF was instrumental in successfully reviving interest in the group. It now&#13;
regularly meets to discuss on-going initiatives, review progress on policy studies and papers, and lead specific work programs (for example, the&#13;
introduction of the rope pump.) The sector discussion series is a new initiative to be undertaken with CEDESA in support of their role as strategic&#13;
&#13;
                                                                          101&#13;

sector thinkers. It is proposed that bi-monthly events be held on a range of sector themes, in order to increase participation and dialogue in the&#13;
policy-making process, leading to improved policies and performance. Regular communications activities include the distribution of publications,&#13;
the production of Portuguese-language documents, and the electronic dissemination of reports and news of interest to sector specialists.&#13;

Partners:                  AFTU2, national and local authorities in country, water utility, GTZ/KFW, Belgium, Unicef&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Enhanced capacity of the sector to manage water and sanitation services in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The overall objectives of the project are to develop specific activities complementing the World Bank financed Rural Water&#13;
Supply and Sanitation Project (PAEMR). Those activities will be developed to support the local governments in the districts related to the PAEMR,&#13;
but with a potential impact on the other districts in the country. This objective would be pursued along three axes:&#13;
1. Management of complex water systems: Water supply systems extending across several districts and/or involving electro-mechanical equipment&#13;
such as pumping stations and chemical water treatment are often left without proper management arrangements for operation and maintenance. This&#13;
deficiency affects number of people in their access to water services. WSP would initiate a study, in close cooperation with the stakeholders to&#13;
explore the possible management options, notably in the "Region des Laves", in the North-West part of the country, where the rural population&#13;
affected is close to 400,000.&#13;
2. Hygiene and sanitation promotion: WSP would revive its partnership with UNICEF, and play a coordination role with PAEMR to develop hygiene&#13;
and sanitation activities in districts related to the project.&#13;
3. Analysis of the financial resources in the sector under the decentralization process, and assistance in the nation wide plan for water supply in rural&#13;
areas set-up.&#13;
4. Support to sector coordination: A stakeholder's consultation will be organized in order to put in place sector coordination among the main donors&#13;
active in the country.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1. Continued implementation of the World Bank financed Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (PAEMR)&#13;
2. Continued political commitment to WSS MDG by the government of Rwanda&#13;
3. Lead public institution to drive the process and involve stakeholders at all levels&#13;

Partner:                  UNICEF, AFD, NGOs, KFW, DGDC, Japan, AFDB, Arabic Funds and private operators&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Improved RWSS policy and programs, featuring a uniform policy of maintenance adopted and implemented by GoS.&#13;
&#13;
Description: Senegal has made substantial progress in reforming and accelerating the delivery of water to urban settlements. The RWSS sub-sector&#13;
is improving, but service delivery is constrained by high cost of technologies, weak institutional capacity, and ineffective use of available resources&#13;
and lack of a sound RWSS maintenance system. This 3-year project includes (i) a review of the RWSS sub-sector, (ii) an assessment of the private&#13;
sector and community participation in RWSS system design, implementation and maintenance, (iii) a study of the resource flows in the sector,&#13;
including an analysis of the structure of costs, and (iv) a study of a PSP for RWS maintenance, including analysis of low-cost technology options.&#13;
The studies of resource flows and PSP for RWS maintenance will be undertaken in partnership with, respectively, the regional thematic groups on&#13;
finance/PRSP and rural. The rural water supply and sanitation sub-sector review aims to identify key success factors for the acceleration of&#13;
sustainable service delivery towards achieving the MDGs. The review will build on the findings of the current study under the MDG initiative. It&#13;
will include the analysis of the institutional arrangements, the financing mechanisms, and the cost structure of available technological options, the&#13;
maintenance system, the private sector participation, and the individual and institutional capacity of key actors. The findings of the policy review&#13;
will assist with the development of new policy and strategy for the management of the RWS systems, the drilling-cost and the sanitation strategy.&#13;
The key steps of the project implementation are (i) assess the current RWSS policy and programs, including the institutional capacity at all levels, the&#13;
financial flows and effectiveness of use of resources, the maintenance system, the private sector and community involvement, the coverage and&#13;
sustainability of service delivery, (ii) set realistic MDG targets and objectives, (iii) develop a long-term strategy translated into multi-annual&#13;
programs including implementation plans and continuous services improvement (WSS MDG strategy &amp; action plan), (iv) develop investment&#13;
programs and sustainable financing systems, including cost recovery and mechanisms for cost reduction and effective use of resources, and (v)&#13;
design capacity enhancement programs including community driven approaches and private participation.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Sustained commitment of Senegalese Government to include rural water supply and sanitation in the PRSP&#13;
2.   Sufficient capacity of local partners to implement new strategy and investment programs&#13;
3.   Effective institutional coordination (civic, public, private sectors and external support agencies)&#13;

Partners:                DFID, AFTU1, UNICEF, Danida, ADC&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Improved and sustainable environmental sanitation and hygiene coverage in Uganda and the achievement of national&#13;
sanitation and hygiene PEAP/MDG objectives.        This will result from a MoH-led supportive and enabling environment with enhanced policy and&#13;
legislative framework, effective multi-sectoral coordination and sanitation financing, functional performance monitoring and district support.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Sanitation coverage in Uganda is likely to remain low unless underlying institutional, financial, and policy/legislative&#13;
constraints are resolved and sanitation and hygiene promotion are accorded due priority at both policy and implementation levels. This DFID-&#13;
funded, MoH (EHD) led and WSP-AF managed capacity building support program is designed to assist the government of Uganda in achieving its&#13;
national sanitation and hygiene promotion and MDG objectives. The Program will strengthen the central functions of the EHD-MoH relating to&#13;
policy and legislation development, national co-ordination, monitoring and district support, and enhance the effectiveness of implementation in the&#13;
districts. The 5 component program will: (i) support implementation of effective functional institutional arrangements for multi-sectoral co-&#13;
ordination for sanitation (ii) strengthen and reorganize the EDH-MoH to develop and deliver on strategic priorities including adopting and&#13;
implementing an effective advocacy strategy and sanitation promotion/marketing program as well as a strategic research framework; (iii) support&#13;
establishment of relevant and effective environmental health policies and legislation; (iv) support formation of an effective sanitation and hygiene&#13;
management information system (MIS); and (v) document and disseminate best practice in sanitation improvement for district and sub-county levels.&#13;
It will be implemented through the Ministry of Health but with close collaboration with sector players.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   GoU takes ownership of the capacity building program and streamlines it within SWAps and MTEFs during the lifetime of the project&#13;
2.   Environmental health will be adequately resourced within the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP II) at both national and district levels.&#13;
3.   Recommendations of national sanitation co-coordinating body are respected and duly executed by stakeholder institutions&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Country-owned National Sanitation MDG/PEAP investment strategy and action plan adopted and implemented by the&#13;
GoU, and leading to significant health and development benefits.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The 2003/4 PEAP (Uganda's version of PRSP) review process highlighted that sanitation MDGs in Uganda were likely to be&#13;
missed (see country strategy sheet for Uganda; MDG and PEAP sanitation targets are 71% and about 80% respectively). It was also shown that other&#13;
MDGs, like Infant and Child Mortality rates appeared unachievable. Sanitation and hygiene were cited amongst key constraints. This has contributed&#13;
to raising the profile for sanitation (e.g., Health Sector Strategic Plan, PEAP and Water and Health Sectors Joint Reviews of 2003 and 2004). The&#13;
achievement of improved and holistic sanitation and hygiene at the household level, in public places and in urban areas is however still a big&#13;
challenge (partly attributed to institutional fragmentation, marginalization/low prioritization and under-funding). The role of the districts in sanitation&#13;
improvement as well as the large disparity in capacities and coverage across districts (range is 4% -&gt;90%; national average about 56%) are well&#13;
recognized. WSP-AF has for the last two years focused on working with government and other stakeholders to support the Government to achieve its&#13;
sanitation and hygiene goals. Efforts are being made to improve sanitation and hygiene data collection and management systems (Project&#13;
EWDAF/UGA/48). To clarify institutional roles and funding gaps, the sector decided to develop an integrated sanitation and hygiene sub-sector&#13;
strategy and investment plan (with support from WSP-AF and under the auspices of the Sanitation Working Group) ­ similar to the one for the water&#13;
sub-sector. This task is implemented in collaboration with the regional finance thematic team. The strategy will address regional/district disparities&#13;
and clearly map the roles and responsibilities, targets, actions and investment needs for all levels. This project will also support government to (i)&#13;
implement and monitor its integrated sanitation strategy and operation plan; (ii) promote ecological/sustainable sanitation approaches in Uganda; and&#13;
(iii) promote sanitation and hygiene best practices in districts. In addition, it planned that WSP-AF will use this project to enhance national sector&#13;
coordination, support to small towns, support other programs that support the achievement of MDGs (e.g., OBA), as well as contribute to the Bank's&#13;
sector activities in Uganda. This project will complement ongoing initiatives including WSP-AF's Project EWDAF/UGA/48.&#13;

Task Manager:            Tim Kennedy&#13;
Client:                  Ministry of Water and Environment, GARWSP&#13;
Country:                 Yemen&#13;
Partners:                Royal Netherlands Ministry for Development Cooperation&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The phased division of RWSS regulatory (GARWSP HQ) and implementation (governorate RWSS authorities)&#13;
functions as recommended by national policy.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: It is anticipated the GoY will issue an executive decree formalizing the National RWSS Policy during mid-year 2005. While&#13;
RWSS policy sets the stage for sub-sector reform and re-organization, actual implementation of its proposals will require substantial backstopping&#13;
and the means to communicate the new way of doing business. WSP- Yemen provides continuing technical assistance and advisory support to the&#13;
Yemen Ministry of Water and Environment, General Authority for Rural Water Supply Projects (GARWSP) and RWSS sub-sector in rural water and&#13;
sanitation sector reform, institutional strengthening, capacity building, financing mechanisms, monitoring/data systems management and improved&#13;
RWSS service delivery in line with the principles of the National RWSS Policy. The main components of this project include support to the reform&#13;
process by assisting the advancement of decentralization within a proposed framework of the separation of executive roles and functions assigned to&#13;
governorate level services implementation authorities (GARWSP branch offices) and regulatory responsibilities taken up the GARWSP central&#13;
agency. In order to facilitate implementation of RWSS policy, WSP-Yemen will also assist the development and implementation of a&#13;
communications strategy and action plan.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   RWSS sector policy ­ strategy roadmap receives national decree.&#13;
2.   GoY and GARWSP commit financing and resources to carry out policy implementation.&#13;
3.   GARWSP embraces national policy and adopts proactive stance in advancing reform and decentralization.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: GoY adopts and begins implementing a national rural sanitation policy and implementation strategy in line with the&#13;
overarching RWSS policy that incorporates hygiene education, institutional arrangements, financing mechanisms, capacity development and&#13;
communications.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The GoY has developed a national RWSS Water Supply and Sanitation Policy. While the issues of water supply are well&#13;
enunciated, the same cannot be said for rural sanitation or the companion issues of hygiene education. The GoY has expressed its commitment to&#13;
MDG rural sanitation target coverage of 58%, however recent estimates indicate a starting point for `safe' rural sanitation at less that 20%. Yemen's&#13;
under five rural child mortality rate is broadly estimated at 120 -150 per 1,000 lives births while overall rural morbidity (persistent diarrhea, eye&#13;
infections) range as high as 50%. These references expose the despairing state of health standards, many of whose conditions are directly attributable&#13;
to poor sanitation options and practices.      WSP­Yemen will assist the GoY in preparing a National Rural Sanitation Policy and Action&#13;
Implementation Plan.     To enhance ownership and responsibility a national stakeholder process including ministerial level official, regional&#13;
government, related RWSS projects and rural communities will be actively encouraged to participate.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   GoY maintains commitment to MDG rural sanitation coverage targets&#13;
2.   Active participation of key stakeholders&#13;
3.   Government level institutional responsibility assigned&#13;
&#13;

Partners:                  DCI, DANIDA, AfDB, GTZ, JICA, Netherlands,&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Local Authorities adopt and begin implementing new RWSS institutional framework, including the key technical tools&#13;
and guidelines critical both at the initiation phase as well as throughout the implementation period.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: According to the 1991 Local Government Act, local authorities are responsible for local water supply and sanitation, but in&#13;
practice have little institutional capacity, with unclear financing arrangements and limited access to finances. In an attempt to deal with these issues,&#13;
the GRZ in November 2004 adopted a new institutional framework for RWSS aimed at devolving RWSS functions and resources to local authorities,&#13;
while building their institutional capacity to deliver; improving the capacity of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Unit (RWSSU) housed in&#13;
MLGH, to monitor and supervise operations in the sector; and improving coordination of donor support in the sector. A number of donors and ESAs,&#13;
in particular DANIDA and the AfDB, are currently preparing programs to support the RWSS by rolling out the new framework. In order to maximize&#13;
this financing opportunity, this 3 year program will assist the GRZ to put in place procedures and instruments critical to the successful&#13;
operationalization of the new institutional framework. With financial support from DCI and working in collaboration with DANIDA, AfDB, and&#13;
other donors, this project will, among other things, facilitate the regularization of the new framework, foster understanding and stakeholder buy-in, as&#13;
well as provide tools for up-scaling and rolling out devolved RWSS delivery based on best practice from the DANIDA, AfDB and other similar&#13;
donor activities.&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: Jan 05                                             End Date Dec 07&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   GRZ, DANIDA, AfDB and other donors maintain commitment to implementation of new framework&#13;
2.   DANIDA funding for district based RWSS activities will commence as planned in January 2006.&#13;
3.   DCI funding for three years, on the basis of the MLGH-WSP-DCI collaboration note will be sustained.&#13;

Country:                  Zambia&#13;
Partners:                 DCI, DANIDA, AfDB, GTZ, JICA, Netherlands, World Bank, DFID,&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: MLGH develops and begins implementing a country owned MDG roadmap, developed through improved sector&#13;
coordination, with harmonized donor practices and MLGH leadership of the WSS sector&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Based on current national progress efforts and levels, the chances of Zambia reaching the MDGs have been pessimistically&#13;
described as `probable' or `unlikely'. However, recognizing that Zambia may risk losing on an opportunity which has a world-wide appeal and&#13;
potential to both attract resources and accelerate and improve service coverage, the GRZ have, since Jan 05, begun a process of preparing a WSS&#13;
MDG roadmap. At the same time, there are a relatively large number of donors and ESAs (including AfDB, DFID, EUWI) working in isolation from&#13;
each other on different MDG processes, leading to duplication of effort, lack of coherency and difficulty for the MLGH to take a lead and ownership&#13;
of the process. As part of their attempt to deal with this problem, the MLGH wishes to develop the MDG roadmap in parallel with a shift from the&#13;
current project approach, to a sector-wide approach in the delivery of WSS. With funding from DCI, this 3-year project sets out to provide support to&#13;
MLGH to harmonize the different MDG processes, by facilitating and strengthening stakeholder consultations and enhancing donor collaboration,&#13;
leading ultimately to the development of a viable country owned MDG roadmap. In order to support the eventual implementation of the roadmap, the&#13;
project working in collaboration with the WSP Finance Thematic Team, will also support the development of effective and sustainable financing&#13;
arrangements by providing technical support to the MLGH Investment programming and the shift to a SWAp. As the achievement of the MDGs&#13;
requires innovative approaches to service delivery, the project will whenever necessary and possible, work in close collaboration with other WSP-AF&#13;
thematic teams such as the urban, sanitation and hygiene, rural etc, whilst at the same time taking advantage of all relevant opportunities provided by&#13;
other WSP or World Bank initiatives such as the Cities Alliance, Output Based Aid, and the Consumer Voice project.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
1.   GRZ committed to MLGH as the ministry responsible for hosting the MDG and SWAp process&#13;
2.   MLGH committed to developing and taking the lead in a programmatic approach and Donors and ESAs willing to collaborate,&#13;
3.   GRZ willing to develop innovative interventions for WSS service delivery&#13;
&#13;

Partners:                WB, WSP global communications, sector institutions, ITNs, WSSCC&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Improved capacity of WSP-AF to generate and disseminate knowledge and engage in MDG advocacy.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The project seeks to strengthen WSP-AF's effectiveness to function as a knowledge generation and dissemination agency to:&#13;
1.   develop communication tools&#13;
2.   disseminate knowledge and advocacy tools&#13;
3.   monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge tools and communication outputs&#13;
4.   engage in regional advocacy initiatives&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Enhanced staffing capacity within WSP-AF communications team&#13;
2.   Increased funding for communication components in WSP-AF programs&#13;
3.   Timely delivery of quality communication inputs from country and theme programs&#13;
&#13;

Project Milestones:&#13;
1.   Strategy develop communication strategy for knowledge generation, dissemination and regional MDG advocacy­ Dec 05&#13;
2.   Delivery standards developed for timely and efficient production of knowledge tools and communication outputs ­ Dec 05&#13;
3.   Evaluation undertaken of at least 1 regional knowledge product ­ Jun 06&#13;
&#13;
Indicators of Outcome:&#13;
1.   At least 6 communication tools repurposed into media articles and&#13;
2.   WSP-AF inputs into global communication products - periodical&#13;
3.   Timely delivery of communication tools against set deadlines ­ Dec 05&#13;
4.   Evaluation report of at least 1 regional knowledge product ­ Jun 06&#13;
5.   Regional advocacy initiatives implemented for at least two themes ­ Jun 06&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Project Update: 7/04 The project focus has changed from FY03 in that the MDG advocacy has been incorporated into specific country work&#13;
  plans and other themes. Progress has been affected by departure of communications specialist based in Dakar. However, a communications&#13;
  specialist already recruited for Nairobi regional office. Recruitment for communications personnel to be based in Dakar and Yemen is ongoing.&#13;
  TM changed from Sarah Leach to Toni Sittoni. WSP-AF's communications capacity was further strengthened through the recruitment of a&#13;
  communications specialist in Dakar and communications assistant in Yemen. Further recruitment of a communications assistant to be based in&#13;
  Nairobi is on going. This growth, as well as the increased demand for communication support to thematic and country programs as a result of&#13;
  WSP-AF expansion into new areas, will require an increased budget envelope. For the remaining part of FY05, the project intends to focus on&#13;
  strategic reform communication by supporting institutions to build their communication capacities to undertake water sector reforms, and scaling&#13;
  up country activities and regional processes ­ such as AMCOW and AMIWASH - towards meetings MDGs. Attention will also focus on&#13;
  supporting communication interventions through sanitation and hygiene promotion.&#13;

EWDAF/FIN/26:             Strengthening WSS in PRSPs in Africa                                                                            Year: 5 of 6&#13;
Task Manager:             Meera Mehta&#13;
Client:                   WSS and PRSP communities in the sub-Saharan African region&#13;
Region:                   Africa&#13;
Partners:                 AFTU1, AFTU2, NORAD, ODI, UNDP, WaterAid, and AMCOW&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Improved incorporation of water and sanitation into PRSPs by national governments in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WSS was not been covered adequately in the first round of PRSP initiatives, despite the fact that poverty assessments and other&#13;
surveys have consistently identified reliable water and hygienic sanitation among the top priorities of the poor. The project will raise awareness&#13;
among WSS and PRSP communities about the status of WSS in PRSPs, reasons for lack of WSS integration in PRSPs, potential opportunities that&#13;
these initiatives present for the sector and the way forward for incorporation of WSS into PRSPs. In addition, the project will address two key&#13;
constraints by exploring advocacy strategies and contributing to strengthening sector information and monitoring systems. The project will also&#13;
identify new directions for WSP-AF support, particularly in the context of progress required for achieving MDGs over the next decade. Inquiries in&#13;
this area were initiated in August 2001. In Jan 02 the first desk review of WSS in PRSPs was presented, followed with a regional workshop on "WSS&#13;
in Poverty Reduction Strategies" in Jun 02. In Oct 03, a performance benchmarking tool to assess the level and quality of the WSS coverage in 12&#13;
country PRSPs was developed and presented as a keynote address at the international conference on Water for the Poorest at Stavanger, Norway. So&#13;
far, the work has identified lack of WSS integration in PRSPs and failure to seize PRSP opportunities in the WSS sector as critical constraints for&#13;
achieving WSS MDGs in sub-Saharan Africa. PRSP processes evolve rapidly and WSP will continue to examine WSS coverage/quality in PRSPs by&#13;
undertaking regular (participatory) WSS in PRSP performance benchmarking reviews, disseminate and hold learning events. When options for WSS&#13;
integration in PRSPs are explored, the work under the project will also include stakeholder advocacy and making the case for WSS in the bidding&#13;
process for scarce resources. The case for WSS dissemination will target different audiences: elected representatives and ministries of finance and&#13;
planning. Additional work will focus on measures for strengthening sector information and monitoring systems including documentation of good&#13;
practice and development application of standard sector monitoring tools for WSS.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.    Development and implementation of PRSPs remains a priority for countries in Africa&#13;
2.    Regional organizations (such as AMCOW and NEPAD) show interest in associating with this activity&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: Oct 01                                            End Date: Jun 07&#13;
&#13;
Indicators of Outcome:&#13;
1.    Improved incorporation of WSS in the PRSPs in at least one country. Measured through performance benchmarking reviews ­ Jun 06/ Jun 07&#13;
&#13;
Project Milestones:&#13;
1.    Inclusion of guidelines by at least one client government for improved inclusion of water supply and sanitation in national surveys ­ Jun 06&#13;
2.    Methodology for unit cost assessment applied by one government ­ Jun 07&#13;
3.    Client countries and/or AMCOW agree with the approach to participatory performance benchmarking ­ Jun 06&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Project Update: 7/05 New Project sheet. 7/05 There has been one change to shift activity on "sector information and monitoring system" to&#13;
  this project based on country level experience that suggests this to be a critical component in improving and sustaining the inclusion of WSS in&#13;
  PRSPs and budget process. Indicator deadline was delayed from 06, milestones adjusted and second indicator dropped following EYR&#13;
  assessment.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Use of improved water and sanitation sector financial planning and strategies by sector ministries and / or regions in focus&#13;
countries in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: In the context of country-owned PRSPs and achievement of WSS-related MDGs in sub-Saharan Africa, the two critical&#13;
constraints are: WSS sector finance and information and monitoring systems. Given the diversity of WSS service providers and sources of funds, a&#13;
clearer understanding of sector finance is essential to improve sector and investment planning to scale up reform as well as improvement of weak sector&#13;
information and monitoring systems and their lack of linkages with financing. The project intends to develop an improved understanding of WSS sector&#13;
finance and tools to support improved financial planning within the relevant sector ministries and institutions. The need for improved WSS sector&#13;
financing and investment planning emerged as a critical need in the regional workshop on "Water and Sanitation in Poverty Reduction Strategies" in&#13;
Jun 02. Since then, WSP-AF has developed countrywide WSS sector snapshot resource flows assessments in six countries. WSP-AF has also initiated&#13;
work on sector investment planning methodologies. In FY06, WSP-AF will develop a synthesis and directions for financial planning based on a&#13;
comparative analysis from these studies. In addition, using lessons from these studies, guidelines and support tools for country level analysis and&#13;
planning will be developed.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   There is continued demand for sector finance assessments and development of financing strategies from additional countries in the region&#13;
2.   WSP-AF is able to mobilize adequate funding for continued demand-based support to countries&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: Jul 02                                           End Date: Jun 07&#13;

2.   Two of the focus countries test and adopt sector finance related tools ­ Jun 07&#13;
&#13;
  Project Update: 7/04 New project sheet 7/05 Outcome and description remain largely the same, with two main changes in activities: i)&#13;
  Leveraging market-based domestic financing, initiated in FY05 through PPIAF support, and shifted in FY06 to a new project, and ii) shifting the&#13;
  activity on sector information and M&amp;E systems to the PRSP project.&#13;

EWDAF/FIN/28:             Leveraging Market-based Resources for the WSS Sector                                                           Year: 1 of 3&#13;
Task Manager:             Meera Mehta&#13;
Client:                   Country WSS and finance institutions, donors, CSOs&#13;
Region:                   Africa&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Increased use of public (/donor) finance by donors and/or national governments to leverage market based resources for the&#13;
WS sector in selected focus countries in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Given the constraints of limited public finance, and the reality of MTEF sector ceilings in many countries, it is essential to&#13;
explore the possibility of leveraging non-public and market-based resources for the WSS investments. Given the sector's continuing emphasis on cost&#13;
recovery there is an opportunity for this, especially in countries where the financial sector shows a reasonable level of development. WSS sector&#13;
investments in major upgrades, new investments and rehabilitation works are invariably `lumpy' and access to market resources would enable service&#13;
providers to make timely investments. These resources also have the benefit of introducing market rigor imposed by lending institutions. This will help&#13;
increase the perennial problem of lack of functionality and introduce efficiency by improved incentives for water service providers. This project builds&#13;
on the ongoing work in Kenya to facilitate microfinance institutions to finance small water projects in rural and peri-urban areas. WSP-AF, with PPIAF&#13;
funding, has developed tools for pre-feasibility assessments of small water projects in Kenya and facilitated independent appraisal by domestic financial&#13;
institutions. In addition, options for business models are being assessed for service provision as well as business development/ support services. This&#13;
project will support the Kenya work, as well as explore similar facilitating role in at least one other focus country. A second activity will focus on a&#13;
better understanding of the possibility and support measures necessary for mobilization of market based resources by urban water service providers by&#13;
both demand (utility profiles and WS sector policy framework) and supply (banks and other specialized financial institutions, and financial sector&#13;
assessments) side assessments. The purpose this scoping study would be to facilitate improved access to market based resources on a sustainable basis&#13;
by smarter us of public (and donor) resources. In both cases, a focus on sector and service provider reforms will be maintained to ensure sustainability&#13;
and access for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1. Financial institutions continue to be interested to take commercial risk for lending to the sector.&#13;
2. It is possible to mitigate or provide cover for country level policy and regulatory risks.&#13;
3. It is possible to mobilize additional budgetary resources necessary in the next two financial years.&#13;

Task Manager:             Madio Fall (West Africa), Andreas Knapp (East and Southern Africa)&#13;
Client:                   Lead country water and/or sanitation departments and utilities&#13;
Countries:                Niger,, Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa, states under the "fragile environment initiative", additional&#13;
                          countries upon request.&#13;
Partners:                 Donors, AMCOW, NEPAD and AFTU1/2&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Specific key reform aspects quickened in selected WSP-AF non focus countries including states classified as fragile&#13;
environments through the provision of well-selected high-quality support upon demand;&#13;
&#13;
Project Description:. The project is designed to be mainly a quick response facility to assist non focus country clients in providing tailored advice&#13;
during key stages of their (sometimes stalled) reform processes, to respond to demands from the WB colleagues to provide technical assistance&#13;
related to WSP-AF's priorities in thematic work, or to seize learning opportunities for WSP. The support may come from either of WSP-AF regional&#13;
hubs. The main requests for support in FY06 so far have been (i) support the improvement of the management of the water supply schemes in Niger,&#13;
(ii) maintaining a sector coordinating role in Malawi, (iii) supporting slum-upgrading household sanitation in Tanzania, (iv) participation in&#13;
evaluation of Masimbane program in RSA. The quick response facility will also provide the necessary flexibility to start WSP-AF's engagement in&#13;
"fragile environments" in order to provide interested parties (ESAs) with a better understanding of the vehicles for potential engagement in fragile&#13;
environments. More specifically the FE initiative will cover the following main activities in Phase 1: (i) Developing the methodology for situation&#13;
assessments and agreeing focus countries. The first task will be to establish criteria and select the countries for a scoping study; detail the&#13;
methodology for (political, sector and poverty) assessments; and elaborate on the key problems to be addressed in the overall program of work. (ii)&#13;
Situation analysis. The second stage will involve undertaking needs assessments and identification of opportunities and constraints to supply in&#13;
different conditions. The analytical work will be undertaken by building linkages between WSP staff and NGOs and other organizations in the field&#13;
who may have already established successful delivery mechanisms. Other requests for support that come during the FY, provided they meet WSP-&#13;
AF's comparative advantage and promote its overall objectives may also be included in this project.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Sida proposal gets financed to provide a sound financial base for the Tanzania program&#13;
2.   DFID funding for the "fragile environment" initiative gets approved&#13;

Task Manager:             Joseph Narkevic&#13;
Client:                   WSP-AF focus country rural water supply ministries&#13;
Country:                  Various, (Mali, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Nigeria, Mozambique, and others to be determined)&#13;
Partners:                 RWSN, SKAT, ITNs, WaterAid, WSP focus countries, AFTU1/2, UNICEF, CARE, others&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome:         New learning in RWSS leads to the adoption of a wider range of technology and management choices for rural water&#13;
supply by utilities and client governments, at a lower investment cost.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: 85% of Africa's unserved live in rural areas, and the majority of rural sub-Saharan Africans depend upon groundwater for&#13;
their household water supply. However, frequent handpump breakdowns coupled with the high costs of current technological options, especially in&#13;
borehole drilling, make it difficult to rapidly increase coverage levels. In addition, the community management model popularized during the last&#13;
water decade has reached its upper limits in terms of sustainable service provision, in the form that it is now practiced. Alternative management&#13;
models need to be developed that respond to a new set of rural realities and possibilities. After careful consideration and study, the RWSN has&#13;
selected three flagship activities meant to respond to the problems of scaleable and sustainable rural water supply.        This project will support the&#13;
RWSN in all three of its primary activities: (i) sustainable handpumps (including operation, maintenance, and management), (ii) cost-effective&#13;
boreholes, and (iii) self-supply. Dissemination of lessons learned and new policy instruments will take place through the extensive RWSN network&#13;
and the information network of its key institutional members.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Partner organizations of RWSN will continue to provide financial and human resource support.&#13;
2.   RWSN outreach activities will be sufficient to influence policy makers.&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: Jul 03                                           End Date: Jun 07&#13;
&#13;
Indicators of Outcome:&#13;
1.   Two countries embarking upon drilling reforms, as shown by changes in specifications or actual cost reductions in drilling tenders ­ Dec 06&#13;
2.   At least two countries implementing RWSN recommended policies for improving handpump sustainability ­ Dec 06&#13;
3.   At least two countries accept self-supply solutions as a valid level of service ­ Dec 07&#13;

  Project Update: 7/04 formerly titled "Strengthening supply chains for HTN/RWSN". WSP assumed financial responsibility for additional&#13;
  activities in light of UNICEF's inability to provide promised funding for low-cost drilling. The "supply chains" activity has been modified to&#13;
  "sustainable handpumps" in order to better reflect the primary problem of rural water supplied through handpumps. The "low-cost drilling"&#13;
  activity has been modified to "cost-effective borehole" in order to better describe the desired long-term results of the thematic work.&#13;

Task Manager:             Joseph Narkevic&#13;
Client:                   National governments in various Sub-Saharan Africa countries&#13;
Countries:                Ethiopia, Mozambique, West Africa (specific countries to be confirmed)&#13;
Partners:                 AFTU1/2, RWSN, UNICEF, ITNs, WaterAid, JICA, drilling entrepreneurs, drilling equipment suppliers, and others&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Reduced borehole costs and increased productivity of borehole entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa countries.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: -It has been estimated that anywhere between 600,000 to one million boreholes will be needed by 2015 to reach the MDGs for&#13;
water supply, the vast majority of these in rural areas. As governments slowly withdraw from direct implementation, the private sector will be&#13;
required to assume a greater role in delivering the boreholes Africa needs. However, costs remain extremely high, and more efficient technologies&#13;
and approaches have been slow to spread on the continent. Similarly dimensioned boreholes are usually six to ten times cheaper in Asia than in&#13;
Africa. Assisting the SSA drilling entrepreneurs to improve their capital stock, debt structures, management capacity, and negotiating strategies is&#13;
expected to result in lower per volume borehole costs, and higher productivity per person and per machine, a win-win situation for the drillers,&#13;
project financiers, and the currently unserved. This project expects to take advantage of and complement the on-going Rural Water Supply&#13;
Network's (RWSN) cost-effective boreholes activity which is currently describing and quantifying the problem of economic borehole delivery in&#13;
SSA. That initiative is expected to research two or three countries in order to develop a policy framework and tools for cost-effective borehole&#13;
delivery. This project expects to build upon some of these lessons, frameworks, and tools, while working closely with drilling entrepreneurs in order&#13;
to achieve on-the-ground impact.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.    SSA governments continue to steadily withdraw from direct implementation of boreholes.&#13;
2.    Drilling entrepreneurs recognize the opportunities with increased productivity, and participate wholeheartedly in capacity building efforts.&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: Jul 05                                            End Date: Jun 08&#13;
&#13;
Indicators of Outcome:&#13;
1.    Participating entrepreneurs experience a greater than 25% decrease in per volume costs (at least 80% of which is passed on to the borehole&#13;
      funder), and a greater than 20% increase in annual profits ­ Jun 09&#13;
2.    Drilling entrepreneurs in three countries report a "significant positive impact" on their productivity resulting from participation in the initiative ­&#13;
      Jul 07&#13;
&#13;
Project Milestones:&#13;
1. At least 24 private sector drillers in three countries are registered in a capacity building process that they have helped structure in order to&#13;
      increase their productivity and reduce per volume drilling costs ­ Oct 06&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Rural water supply and sanitation services are delivered through local government and private sector partnerships at a&#13;
faster rate and in a more sustainable fashion than through current implementation and management arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Community management has long been promoted as the solution for rural water supply throughout the developing world.&#13;
However, increasing evidence suggests that long-term survival of service delivery depends upon more factors than community management alone&#13;
can respond to. It is also becoming clear that increasing the rate of service provision will depend upon finding improved mechanisms for channeling&#13;
funds while improving accountability for service quality and longevity. The concept of grouping communities in order to reduce transaction costs&#13;
and improve service delivery is not new. Many examples of agglomeration have been well documented, though primarily in urban areas and small&#13;
towns. Options for rural communities have been scant, and usually based either upon the organizational power of the communities themselves, or&#13;
upon highly subsidized outside intervention. Attempts to facilitate private sector participation in RWS construction, operation, and management&#13;
have not been previously attempted at scale.&#13;
&#13;
Changing rural realities suggest that now is the time to seriously consider PSP in large-scale RWS. Rural household incomes are rising, greater&#13;
levels of service are being demanded, population densities are increasing, and transportation and communication services are expanding rapidly,&#13;
along with new commercial networks. However, the tools and mechanisms needed to establish such rural service areas have not yet been developed.&#13;
This project intends to produce these and other tools for policy makers interested in expanding sustainable rural water coverage.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Rural quality of life and consumption power will continue to increase.&#13;
2.   Local entrepreneurs, if well informed about the business opportunities in rural areas, will be keen to participate in FRUGAL-type arrangements.&#13;
3.   Governments and NGOs will continue to withdraw from direct implementation of projects and O&amp;M subsidies, and be open to designing and&#13;
     providing incentives for PSP in RWS.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Two countries adopt and begin implementation of user guidelines, which feature a guidance note on the comparative&#13;
advantages of various sanitation technologies.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Several studies suggest that hygiene promotion is key to sustaining sanitation programs through effective use and maintenance of&#13;
sanitation infrastructures and behavior changes for reduction of water borne diseases. Several hygiene promotion techniques and guidelines have been&#13;
developed and used in several countries, but very little knowledge of their cost-effectiveness and impacts is available. WSP-AF has been a pioneer in&#13;
designing and promoting PHAST. It is strongly involved in the global hand washing initiative and is supporting a hand washing program in Senegal, for&#13;
which WSP-AF has secured financial resources from the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) for scaling activities in 4 regions. The project aims&#13;
to review existing hygiene promotion techniques and develop a hygiene promotion strategy, including integration of hygiene in sanitation programs. The&#13;
activities are to (i) support the PPPHW campaign in Senegal and assess the cost-effectiveness of the approach, (ii) document the cost-effectiveness of the&#13;
PPPHW program in a second country (Ghana, Benin, or Ethiopia), (iii) finalize the cost-effectiveness of PHAST in Uganda, and document the cost-&#13;
effectiveness of PHAST in a second country (e.g. Tanzania) or a third promotion technique (e.g., SANIYA in Burkina Faso, or Health Club in&#13;
Zimbabwe), (iv) undertake the second phase of the hygiene promotion network study, and (v) provide policy support to 2 selected countries develop and&#13;
implement cost-effective hygiene promotion programs. The studies of hygiene promotion techniques will help develop a guidance note for policy support&#13;
on cost-effectiveness of hygiene promotion. The hygiene promotion network study and lessons learnt of cost-effectiveness of hygiene promotion&#13;
techniques will help develop a hygiene promotion strategy for WSP-AF, including a networking component under the under the AfricaSan initiative.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Availability of data regarding hygiene promotion techniques in selected countries for lessons learnt documentation&#13;
2.   Commitment of 2 countries for the piloting of hygiene promotion techniques&#13;
3.   WSP-AF proposal for funding to SIDA accepted and resources available on time&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Two countries adopt and utilize a knowledge resources base on sanitation marketing developed, tested and used to&#13;
accelerate sanitation services delivery in poor settlements.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: For the last 3 years, WSP-AF has developed and disseminated a sanitation knowledge resources base with the support of SIDA.&#13;
The activities included the conceptualization of a sanitation marketing approach for a better understanding of sanitation services demand, supply-side&#13;
issues and the enabling environment. In addition, WSP-AF has established the basis for sanitation networking for knowledge development and&#13;
sharing through the holding of a continental conference (AfricaSan) and 3 sub-regional meetings (AfricaSan South, East, and West/Center). The&#13;
marketing framework includes (i) getting consensus on approach, including subsidy policy, (ii) learning from the market, (iii) overcoming barriers to&#13;
sanitation demand, (iv) developing the right products, (v) supporting a striving industry, and (vi) regulating transport and waste disposal, including&#13;
EcoSan. The latter aspect has been further developed through the review of EcoSan experiences in Eastern and Southern Africa and collaboration&#13;
with CREPA EcoSan research program in West Africa also funded by SIDA. The present project aims to consolidate the sanitation knowledge base&#13;
and translate it into action through:&#13;
·    roll-out sanitation marketing programs at scale in 2 selected countries; prospective countries are Benin, Burkina, Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda.&#13;

Task Manager:             Alain Morel&#13;
Client:                   Utilities in 5 capital cities and civil society organizations (NGOs and consumer associations) in 5 target countries&#13;
Region:                   Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Malawi, Zambia, Senegal)&#13;
Partners:                 WaterAid, Consumer associations, community representatives, local NGOs and civil society, regulators, utilities, water&#13;
                          departments/ministries&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Consumers, CSOs and service providers have access to sustainable governance arrangements channeling consumer&#13;
voice, and resulting in improved accountability to the poor.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The capacity to tap into, and strategically channel, consumer voice is a critical element in the process of improving service&#13;
delivery. One means of channeling that has been used successfully in many countries is the Report Card as developed by the Public Affairs Centre in&#13;
Bangalore, India. The Report Card is an evaluation tool that provides quantified user feedback to service delivery standards in a way that allows for&#13;
improvements in governance arrangements and benchmarking over the long term. Within this project, key constraints to service delivery to the poor&#13;
will be identified and the Report Card mechanism will be developed to enable communities, especially the poor to demand accountability from water&#13;
and sanitation service providers and government stakeholders. Strategic communication models will be developed as part of advocacy to manage the&#13;
political risks and urban reform to catalyze progress towards achievement of the MDG goals. The project will developed from prior work done by&#13;
WSP with consumer organizations in Africa. The project has two main components&#13;
(i)  Identifying potential national partnerships from stakeholders involved in urban service delivery as a platform for consumer voices, and building&#13;
     their capacity to carry out urban water supply and sanitation Report Cards on an ongoing basis in two cities.&#13;
(ii) Analyzing and documenting weaknesses in service delivery systems that result in corruption, inefficiency and inequities in services delivery.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Suitable conditions exist the target cities for Report Cards to be an effective tool.&#13;
2.   Suitable partners exist (a strong civil society organization to be the Lead Implementing Agency, and a competent and experience social survey&#13;
agency)&#13;
3.   Sector stakeholders are able to work together in an alliance to implement the Report Cards, and then can make good use of the results in a&#13;
variety of advocacy initiatives&#13;
4.   Advisory services from the Public Affairs Foundation of Bangalore are available&#13;

Client:                    Urban authorities in 4 countries selected from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Zambia, Burkina Faso, Benin, DRC.&#13;
Region:                    Africa&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The capacity of water and sanitation institutions, and the interface between utilities/municipalities and private actors&#13;
operating in the market, is developed and brings about increased coverage to the unserved urban poor.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Based on the WSP work with the Africa Water Utilities Partnership (WUP), Toolkit and Good Practice documents which&#13;
outline the key areas for capacity building and institutional reform, this project will further develop and disseminate pro-poor tools, and build the&#13;
capacity of utilities and local governments in pro-poor approaches. Working with 4 out of the 8 utilities selected for the fourth phase of the WUP&#13;
project # 5, it will undertake practical activities with utilities to promote pro-poor instruments in reform processes. Related previous and current work&#13;
supported by AFD in Kisumu, Nairobi and Mombasa will be closely integrated to the project, and will complement the other activities. The project&#13;
builds on prior WSP-AF, WUP and MDP work implemented during previous FYs.&#13;
&#13;
Activity A: Developing the capacity of utilities and municipalities for local PS engagement. With limited and deteriorating networks, low&#13;
capacity, insufficient bulk water supply and questionable political will, the level of coverage of poor areas by utilities and municipalities is very low.&#13;
The water that makes its way to the urban poor does so through intermediate or independent means, through privately established piped or&#13;
transported operations. Understanding the characteristics of this transfer process is critical to pro-poor sector reform processes. Using this knowledge,&#13;
optimizing the mechanisms and supporting the various actors involved can result in significant improvements in service to the poor, sometimes with&#13;
little public investment. These DPSP-related activities are vital segments of action plans / roadmaps aimed at accelerating progress toward the WSS&#13;
MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
The project will develop practical tools and instruments for utilities to assess, strategize, negotiate, communicate, contract and perhaps regulate and&#13;
finance the path to a more sustainable distribution system in slums. It will provide support for skills development in this unconventional area of&#13;
business, much-needed attitudinal change, as well as the institutionalization of processes through management and organizational options (such as&#13;
pro-poor units) in utilities. The methods of developing pro-poor attitudes and skills of utility and LG officials will draw on the established process&#13;
from WUP and involve two sub-regional launch workshops which bring together the pre-selected utilities and key partners as well as resource&#13;
persons/consultants. It will utilize a strategy which emphasizes the need for political champions and high-level managers able to spearhead the&#13;
process of change, skills development and incentives to serve the poor, followed by direct engagement with utilities to impart best practice and&#13;
mainstream a pro-poor focus in their business planning and annual budget allocations. A key aspect is to build support within the utilities /&#13;
municipalities to endorse and nominate the staff and to bring about the organizational change needed to create an effective and functioning pro-poor&#13;
unit.&#13;
&#13;
Activity B: Supporting the development of an effective interface between utilities and SMPPs. WUP5 and a complementary WSP initiative on&#13;
SSIPs have highlighted the need to facilitate the interface between the local private providers and utilities and local government. The interface may&#13;
be (i) physical - bulk meters, bulk supply, subnetworks (ii) financial - through bulk pricing, bulk meters and accountability / simplification /&#13;
rationalization of revenue collection, incentive structures; or (iii) legal - through effective compacts (MoUs, contracts, tender procedures) that work&#13;
for both sides; (iv) managerial ­ through partnership building or (v) institutional by nominating staffing and establishing a dialogue. This project&#13;
aims at pioneering the integration of SSP into ongoing reforms by supporting the various aspects that makeup this interface between the actors,&#13;
facilitating action, unlocking blockages and building the capacity of all actors involved. This bridge between the formal and informal is a keystone&#13;
critical to improving service delivery to the urban poor.               The activities will be convergent with the support for SMPPs described in&#13;
EWDAF/URB/xx/2, and the institutional capacity building activities described above and will be coupled together for their implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The practical tools developed in this project will be disseminated to all WUP, MDP and WSP-AF partners in Africa and through the global DPSP&#13;
Initiative.&#13;

Project Description: National government has the primary responsibility for progress towards the MDGs. Overall, this project will provide support&#13;
to national government to develop a structured, phased and costed method for meeting the MDGs. In a context of governmental commitment to&#13;
institutional reforms, those efforts aim at improving efficiency of service to the connected population, but also at extending services to the un-served&#13;
peri-urban populations through public-private-partnership development.           More specifically, this project will assist selected African client&#13;
governments to meet the urban WSS/MDGs through: (i) the integration of DPSP in the development of country-owned roadmaps to meet the&#13;
WSS/MDGs; (ii) assisting countries in developing capacity building strategies, policy reform initiatives and programs that recognize the role of&#13;
DPSP for WSS services for the urban poor in the context of ongoing reforms in the water sector; and, (iii) active support to regional capacity building&#13;
and knowledge networks and partnerships involving policy makers and service providers. On regulatory issues, conventional regulation frames are&#13;
usually inadequate for SMPP, and a specific attention will be given to customer feed-back channels, equality of SMPPs and other providers in access&#13;
to public financial support, and standard requirement focusing on quality issues rather than price. This work will be developed through support to&#13;
country teams, policy review, the development of urban WSS MDG road maps, and sub-regional capacity and awareness building/sharing events,&#13;
strengthening the work initiated in Kenya, Zambia and Benin.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Commitment to the reform process remains high on the government's agenda of the selected countries&#13;
2.   Preconceptions regarding SMPPs can be overcome through capacity building and awareness raising&#13;
3.   Willingness of development partners to collaborate on supporting the reform process and extension of WSS services to peri-urban areas&#13;
4.   This includes policy work that would enable any domestic private sector, CBOs, NGOs and other local providers operating outside the&#13;
     government system, serving the urban poor&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: This project aims to support the development of SMPPs to create a more dynamic and effective water and sanitation&#13;
marketplace, more able to extend services to the unserved urban poor.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WSP-Africa is working with clients to find pragmatic ways to achieve the WSS MDGs in Africa. Most water utilities are not&#13;
effective or interested in delivering WSS services to the urban poor. In response to the unfulfilled demand, a thriving number of small and medium&#13;
private providers have developed businesses out of selling water and providing sanitation services. Despite links to public health and water supply,&#13;
they are mostly unregulated. The proposed activity builds on WSPs recent experience with urban WSS SMPPs and will identify and develop a&#13;
package of supporting instruments, formulate and implement capacity building strategies for water and sanitation service providers business,&#13;
technical, financial and management development, and explore the potential of the sanitation marketing concept. This can be defined through the&#13;
following 3 sets of activities, many of which are closely liked to the activities undertaken on EWDAF/URB/yy/1.&#13;
&#13;
1. Developing workable strategies and supporting instruments to build the capacity of SMPPs. Associated with the ongoing water utility&#13;
reforms that promote engagement with SMPPs (see Project EWDAF/URB/xx), the project will support local water providers to access support to&#13;
remove the constraints blocking them from providing sustainable services in poor areas. The focus of this work is twofold: (a) through the promotion&#13;
of provider associations, that not only organize and improve the credibility and status of members, but provide them with a forum through which they&#13;
can communicate and negotiate with utilities. Provider associations also provide a forum for dispute resolution, self regulation, business development&#13;
and accessing finance, all key issues as demand increases and businesses grow. Efforts to support the formation of water associations in Nairobi will&#13;
be extended, lessons learnt and methodologies developed for support in 3 additional cities; (b) through managerial, commercial, technical and&#13;
financial capacity building. The project will develop strategies and design the means to support water SMPPs business and technical development&#13;
(e.g. sub-network metering, maintenance), customer service / revenue management (tariffs and collection) and financing (revolving loans). A key&#13;
part of this process will be the identification and training of partner organizations to roll out support. This activity is closely linked to the work&#13;
described in Project EWDAF/URB/yy/1, in which the processes of utilities contracting and interacting with SIPS are developed.&#13;
&#13;
2. Supporting Small Scale Providers of Sanitation Services (SSPSS). The project will also analyze the sanitation services market in 2 WSP focus&#13;
countries (Burkina Faso and Kenya) to establish a deeper understanding of their strengths and constraints. It will develop models of regulation for&#13;
sanitation SSMPs and evaluate the options for consolidating SSPSSs into associations that promote self-regulation. In Kenya, support will be&#13;
provided to a pre-identified group of SSPSSs where WSP-AF has been approached to assist in the formation of an association and to engage with the&#13;
Ministry of Health and the Nairobi City Council to develop a workable partnership. The objectives are to (i) improve the working conditions of&#13;
providers, (ii) develop an agreed framework for activity with all relevant stakeholders, and (iii) integrate their legal status in the frame of the new&#13;
sanitation policy currently under preparation. In Burkina Faso,the project will assess the capacity building needs of SSPSS and propose action plans&#13;
to promote their specialization in the sector, and make their activity more sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
3. Support the capacity of SMPPs to stimulate demand through sanitation marketing. This sub-project will build on work carried out with&#13;
SIDA-funding develop a sanitation marketing approach for better understanding of the sanitation marketplace. WSP-AF has established the basis for&#13;
sanitation networking for knowledge development and sharing through a series of regional and sub-regional events. The marketing framework&#13;
requires consensus on the basics of the approach, including: (i) subsidy policy, (ii) learning from the market, (iii) overcoming barriers to sanitation&#13;
demand, (iv) developing the right products, (v) supporting a striving industry, and (vi) regulating transport and waste disposal. The proposed project&#13;
aims to consolidate the sanitation knowledge base and translate it into action:&#13;
     ·    roll-out sanitation marketing programs at scale in 3 selected countries (Tanzania, Uganda and Benin).&#13;
     ·    develop an advocacy toolkit including the economic, health and education benefits to raise the profile of the sector;&#13;
The project will be linked to the WSP GPT initiative to learn from the sanitation marketing under implementation in Vietnam, and the CLTS in&#13;
Bangladesh both concerned with public-goods aspects of sanitation.&#13;

Partners:                  WB, DFID, national and local governments in participating countries, NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
Desired Activity Outcome: Increased financial and technical inputs from the domestic private sector improve the scale and rate of progress towards&#13;
the WSS MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description:&#13;
This project aims to develop further the domestic opportunities for WSS in Cambodia by supporting World Bank led initiatives. At present, funding&#13;
is available through BNWP/PPIAF to support the Government of Cambodia for:&#13;
     PPIAF ­funded activities aimed at enabling clients to (i) conduct studies/assessments to establish the scale and nature of activities carried out by&#13;
these providers; (ii) developing a database of information on these providers to enable government to plan, manage and monitor the development of&#13;
the sector.&#13;
     BNWP ­funded activities aimed at supporting the development of small-scale private (informal and formal) providers through: (i) the study and&#13;
reform of policy and business environments for small-scale water supply; and (ii) the development of sector programs to improve the conditions&#13;
under which they operate; activities such as (i) develop a training program for transferring needed technical and management skills and knowledge&#13;
to SPSPs, (ii) strengthen the regulatory environment, including upgrading and/ or reforming the licencing regime (to bring it more in line with the&#13;
contracts that are being issued); (iii) and supporting the process of licencing the SPSPs&#13;
&#13;
The work proposed under a follow-on activity will build on this BNWP/PPIAF initiative by providing funds to operationalize key support&#13;
mechanisms. The exact nature of these supporting mechanisms would be identified through this work by the Bank Task Managers. The Government&#13;
of Cambodia has requested support to mobilize finance in the sector and it is likely that the finance funding window (2) under the DPSP project will&#13;
be sought.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Political will to introduce stronger PSP in the sector.&#13;
2.   Sufficient local and district level governments interested in engagement&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Rural sanitation coverage increases following opening up of new marketing channels and availability of appropriate&#13;
low-cost options.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Rural sanitation coverage in Cambodia is extremely low; currently around 8%. This figure has not significantly changed over&#13;
the past 5 years, and on current trends the CMDG target coverage rate will be missed by a wide margin. The background to this is complicated and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           129&#13;

includes a number of social and technological factors. While sanitation promotion campaigns are common and widespread, open defecation remains&#13;
widely practiced. The technological side of the problem includes the promotion of inappropriate and expensive latrine designs (leading to disused&#13;
and/or dysfunctional facilities) as well as issues such as flooding, high ground water tables, etc. An area of attention which has hitherto been ignored&#13;
completely is the design of adaptations enabling the use of sanitation facilities by disabled people (approx. 1 in 175 people in Cambodia suffer a&#13;
disability resulting from accidents with land mines or unexploded ordnance). While UNICEF subsidizes some materials for household latrines, what&#13;
facilities exist are overwhelmingly privately financed and constructed by small-scale domestic private contractors.&#13;
&#13;
The project aims to address the low rate of coverage on a number of fronts:&#13;
     (i)         Develop a better understanding of available sanitation choices, user preferences, costs and coverage patterns by studying 3-5 selected&#13;
                 provinces;&#13;
     (ii)        Expand the menu of appropriate choices by working on lowering costs, designing for the physical environment and including&#13;
                 adaptations for disabled users. This work will involve users (including those with disabilities), contractors and others as appropriate,&#13;
                 and results will be published in a (pictorial) manual of sanitation choices.&#13;
     (iii)       Increase availability of sanitation options by piloting and developing marketing channels&#13;
     (iv)        Developing the capacity of the domestic private sector by informing and training private contractors, undertaking market research,&#13;
                 and incorporating developments in awareness raising campaigns as carried out by MRD, UNICEF and others.&#13;
&#13;
Work on points (i) and (ii) started in FY05, and some materials are currently under development. UNICEF and PLAN International have agreed to&#13;
field test the materials once they are issued in early FY06. The 5-province ADB/MRD Rural water Supply and Sanitation Project will also use the&#13;
materials in its sanitation work (aiming to reach the CMDG rural sanitation goal in 5 provinces by 2011). The ADB investment will provide a&#13;
vehicle for leveraging rapid scale-up of impact from these initial outputs.&#13;
&#13;
A major second phase to WSP's sanitation initiative in Cambodia, to be launched in FY06 (subject to funds being available), will involve two&#13;
components. First, a rural sanitation market study aimed at assessing drivers of and constraints to demand for and supply of rural sanitation services&#13;
will be carried out. Inter alia, the survey will answer questions relating to availability, accuracy and sources of information on sanitation; availability&#13;
of household funds, willingness to spend and spending priorities; availability, skills and costs of sanitation suppliers; incentives and disincentives for&#13;
families to buy sanitation services and for suppliers to supply them.&#13;
&#13;
Second, a sanitation services marketing pilot in three provinces of Cambodia based on the findings of the sanitation market study will be carried out.&#13;
The pilot project will focus on three issues ­ identifying an extended range of sustainable sanitation infrastructure options, increasing the availability&#13;
of competent service providers, and development and implementation of a sanitation promotion campaign. The overall approach draws on the&#13;
successful sanitation marketing program supported by the Intl. NGO IDE in Vietnam. WSP will work closely with IDE's Cambodia program to&#13;
carry out the market study, design and execute the marketing pilot activities. Marketing pilots will be undertaken in the context of field trials within&#13;
the ADB-funded project and possibly with other large-scale investments to be identified, to provide ample opportunities for rapid scale-up. This&#13;
work will form part of WSP's global thematic work on sanitation marketing, and will both contribute to and benefit from knowledge sharing through&#13;
the sanitation Global Practice Team.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Informed selection of household water treatment options by Cambodian consumers&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: UNICEF supports the use of Ceramic Water Purifiers (CWP) in arsenic affected areas. In addition, the CWP are marketed by&#13;
two international NGOs, IDE and RDI. One proponent of the filters (IDE) has wanted to conduct a follow-up evaluation of performance for some&#13;
time. UNICEF has now received AusAID funding to perform an evaluation, and would like WSP to be involved in it as independent agency.&#13;
The proposed approach is that UNICEF will fund the evaluation, while WSP will provide technical support, review the evaluation findings and&#13;
report, and publish the results as a field note. The larger context of this study is that government and donors are interested in establishing a national&#13;
verification system for domestic water treatment technologies (many of which are being marketed or given away for free by NGOs). The CWP&#13;
evaluation would provide information on possible ways to carry out such verifications.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   A market for locally produced and marketed water filters exists&#13;

Project Description: The Indonesia country program predominantly consists of WSP-EAP's flagship program, WASPOLA II, which is a second 5-&#13;
year project funded by AusAID for sector policy formulation and implementation support. Starting in FY06 the Dutch-funded ISSDP, managed by&#13;
WSP-EAP, will begin to support sanitation activities.         In addition, WSP-EAP manages sector research, capacity building, and knowledge&#13;
management activities funded from a range of external Trust Funds, and provides approximately 60 staff weeks of cross support annually to The&#13;
World Bank for project preparation, operations, and AAA work.&#13;
&#13;
This project will coordinate the seemingly diverse range of activities above in accordance with WSP-EAP's country strategy in Indonesia, which&#13;
is to develop critical synergies among the Business Plan projects/activities in order to influence sector investments from all sources and&#13;
maximize impact on the WSS sector in the country. This will continue to be done through a) supplementing sanitation policy development&#13;
through the WASPOLA II project with further sector development support from ISSDP ­ leading to a national sanitation and hygiene strategy&#13;
to operationalize sanitation and hygiene components of National Policies for Community-based WSES and Institutionally-managed WSS&#13;
services, b) linking WASPOLA II-funded policy implementation support to local governments with World Bank projects for local governance&#13;
reform; c) linking field trials in large-scale Bank projects and outcome monitoring studies funded by WASPOLA with the formulation of a&#13;
national sanitation and hygiene strategy through ISSDP; d) addressing issues of WSS service delivery to the poor through participation in the&#13;
Bank's AAA work on poverty analysis and decentralization and through research funded by PPIAF and Consultant Trust Fund; e) scaling up&#13;
implementation of sector policy reform through preparation of The World Bank's third WSLIC project in the form of a national program&#13;
(NPCWSSS); f) implementation support to the Bank's new urban sanitation investments (UWSIEP) using knowledge gathered from pilot&#13;
projects (SANIMAS), rural/urban research studies, and field trials.&#13;
&#13;
This project also includes staff time allocated to work planning, progress reporting, overseeing compliance to establishing procedures for quality&#13;
assurance in delivery of the work program to clients, and adjusting the Indonesia Country Team professional skill mix in accordance with client&#13;
demands for services.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome:            Increased acceptance by GoI, financing and implementing partners of WSP-EAP's advisory and knowledge&#13;
management role in Indonesian urban WSS, in particular in the reform of WSS institutions towards pro-poor outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Project description: This project is the continuation of business development in the urban sector in Indonesia. The recently conducted External&#13;
Evaluation of the Program observed that in EAP, Program concentration has largely been in the community-managed portion of the sector, where&#13;
projects are largely rural and use a community demand driven approach. The evaluation recommends that WSP-EAP reposition its services to&#13;
become more relevant to the needs of a larger group of potential clients. The suggestion was that the Program adopt a new thrust towards improved&#13;
institutional effectiveness, as this would emphasize a major outcome-level problem in the sector, at the same time reflect the Program's wholesale&#13;
relationship to its clients ­ that is, WSP works with the institutions that deliver service to end users, rather than delivering the service itself. In this&#13;
regard, WSP-EAP is looking to develop its programs in urban water supply and sanitation and pro-poor work, eventually implement a regional urban&#13;
sanitation program consistent with the needs of countries in the region, WSS stakeholders and WSP-EAP comparative advantage.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The project aims to increase the capacity of the GoI to implement the Community Based policy and continue the on-going&#13;
process of policy reform for the WSES sector emphasizing demand responsive and participatory approaches, in order to scale up sustainable access to,&#13;
and effective use of, improved WSS services by all- especially the rural and urban poor.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: This project is the second phase of AusAID-funded support for WSS sector policy formulation and implementation.&#13;
WASPOLA 1 resulted in preparation of a National Policy for Development of Community Managed Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation&#13;
Facilities and Services. There is still a need to increase efforts in policy implementation, and to broaden the policy framework to incorporate&#13;
institutionally managed WSES systems and to increase the emphasis on environmental sanitation. The emphasis on policy implementation and&#13;
broadening of the policy framework has strong support within GoI.&#13;
&#13;
Project activities are based on the Project's primary capacity building role for policy implementation and reform, using demand responsive and&#13;
participatory approaches which were the foundation for the achievements of WASPOLA 1. The same approaches continue to underpin objectives and&#13;
activities in WASPOLA 2. In Indonesia's decentralized setting, WASPOLA's capacity building efforts will necessarily focus on assisting LGs&#13;
gearing up institutionally and financially to achieve WSS-MDGs at the local (district and city) levels, through the operationalization of new national&#13;
Sector Policies for Community-based WSES and Institutionally-managed WSS services. Desired outcomes in those respects will mean development&#13;
and operationalization of district level MDG-WSS Roadmaps/Strategic Plans within institutional structures and systems for development planning,&#13;
implementation and monitoring by Local Governments.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   There is widespread support for the reform from govt, partners, donors, and private sector.&#13;
2.   There is sufficient capacity among sector actor to implement reforms.&#13;
3.   No natural disaster diverts attention and resources away from the project.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Activity Outcome: Capacity of the Government of Indonesia strengthened to implement and monitor WSES sector reform through a focus&#13;
on (a) operationalizing the national sector policy at the district level; and (b) preparation of national strategies and local action plans to achieve the&#13;
WSS-MDGs. The desired outcome is the development and operationalization of district level MDG-WSS Roadmaps/Strategic Plans within&#13;
institutional structures and systems for development planning, implementation and monitoring by Local Governments.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Under this project WSP-EAP's capacity building efforts will necessarily focus on assisting Local Governments gearing up&#13;
institutionally and financially to achieve WSS-MDGs at the local (district and city) levels, through the operationalization of new national Sector&#13;
Policies for Community-based WSES and Institutionally-managed WSS services.&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of the activity is to provide support to local government to develop their own polices and development work plans which reflect the&#13;
priorities of the LGs and introduce the targets set by the MDG. The Working Group will play an active role in this series of activities by providing&#13;
inputs from the group itself and financial support directly from the government budget for WASPOLA activities. One of the main activities for this&#13;
year under this component is the preparation of a Financial Strategy to examine the financial flows into local government. The purpose of this study&#13;
is to understand the how the financial sector in Indonesia is structured to deliver resources to LGs and to strengthen LGs ability to access these&#13;
resources. The activities under this component are labor intensive at require facilitators to be based in the provinces for most of the year. The&#13;
management of these facilitators is managed by the WASPOLA project.&#13;

Desired Activity Outcome: Capacity for implementation of sustainable institutionally-managed water supply services and environmental sanitation&#13;
is developed within Indonesia through the development and adoption of effective policies which has the support of national and local government&#13;
institutions."&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: The role of WASPOLA in this component is to facilitate and support GoI at the national level through established structures&#13;
and assist with the formulation of effective policies, and to build capacity throughout this process. This will culminate in a nationally endorsed,&#13;
pragmatic, and comprehensive WSES policy framework which has been supported and endorsed by both national and local government institutions.&#13;
The main component of this activity is the development of a national policy for institutionally managed water and sanitation for Indonesia. This&#13;
activity follows on from the community-based policy which was completed in 2003.during the past 12 month period the working group has&#13;
developed the third draft of the institutional policy in this draft has been distributed to senior government officials at Echelon 1 level to receive their&#13;
comments and suggestions. In the coming 12 months period it is planned that this third draft will be translated into English and distributed globally&#13;
for comments and peer review. The significance of this document within government is very important as this document is one of the key outcomes&#13;
of the project. WSP-EAP will provide technical assistance to evaluate current policies in the areas of institutionally-managed water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation and harmonize and improve policies across the different institutions that are involved. It will also provide facilitation to&#13;
engage stakeholders from within and outside government as a key activity over the next 12 months to ensure that there is buy in from not only the&#13;
public sector but also acceptance within the private sector.&#13;

Desired Activity Outcome: Sector stakeholders implement/support sustainable water and sanitation programs.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: This activity has a number of major field trials which are being carried out in collaboration with other projects currently&#13;
active in Indonesia. The objective of these activities is to enhance the knowledge of the sector and develop options for water and sanitation service&#13;
delivery at an affordable cost. One of the significant shortfalls in any project development in the sector in Indonesia had the current time is lack of&#13;
accurate data in terms of coverage of the sector. For the MDGs to be achieved is critical that an accurate data is gathered for inclusion in project&#13;
preparation in this component will be investigating ways to improve data gathering and reliability. During 2005 study will be carried out on the&#13;
SANIMAS project that was funded by AusAID and completed in 2004 this study will evaluate the impact which this project had both socially and&#13;
financially for the communities that participated. This component also includes the preparation and distribution of sector information and data to&#13;
other stakeholders and projects both in Indonesia and globally. Many of the activities contained in this component have a relatively flexible output&#13;
and in the past have included support for Expo's and displays which are carried out both in Jakarta and regionally. Within this activity list there is&#13;
provision of a budget to provide cross support to other projects these include WSLIC, ADB, USAID and ISSDP currently active in Indonesia at the&#13;
present time. It is also expected that some of the activities under this component will be used to support reconstruction work in Aceh.&#13;

Country:                   Indonesia&#13;
Partners:                  Local governments, NGOs, private sector&#13;
&#13;
Desired Activity Outcome: Sector stakeholders reach a consensus on scaling up rural sanitation including supporting large-scale shifts in hygiene&#13;
and sanitation behaviors and attracting investment from multiple sources for improving sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: The first phase of WASPOLA (1998-2003) resulted in the formulation of a national policy framework for community­&#13;
managed WSES services, which is being operationalized with district level local governments during the second phase of the project.&#13;
Operationalization requires first conceptualizing in concrete terms what actions will be taken by local governments to translate policy principles into&#13;
practice, and then executing them in realistic settings. The more innovative types of interpretations usually require selectively-conducted trials in&#13;
large-scale project settings before they can be adopted institutionally. This activity will fill gaps in the knowledge of sector stakeholders by carrying&#13;
out field trials in large-scale projects for selected policy issues of importance to MDG targets, i.e., scaling up hygiene improvements and access to&#13;
basic sanitation, institutional approaches to gender issues in sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
This activity is the application of the CLTS (community-led total sanitation approach currently under way in Bangladesh and India) in selected&#13;
communities participating in WSLIC 2 and ADB projects, with optimal involvement of local government and NGO stakeholders. It was initiated&#13;
during FY05 with a study visit by a team of GoI and NGO partners (who will be instrumental in carrying out the field trial) to Bangladesh and India.&#13;
Starting in May 2005, field trials are being initiated in 6 WSLIC districts and 3 ADB districts with the help of international consultants experienced&#13;
in CLTS approaches and local facilitating agencies, and in consultation with local governments interested in trying out such an approach. Results of&#13;
the field trial will be evaluated with participating communities and other stakeholders during FY06. Emerging learning will be used by the&#13;
WASPOLA Working Group in the process of better defining the sanitation and hygiene components of the community-managed WSES policy, and&#13;
developing a National Sanitation Strategy - with further funding from the Dutch ­funded ISSDP.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
1. GOI will continue to prioritize sector reform as the principal strategy to achieve the WSS-MDGs sustainably.&#13;
2. Natural disasters will not divert attention and funds away from programmatic approaches for sector development&#13;
3.   Local government agencies concerned will be interested and participate in the field trials with cost-sharing.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Activity Outcome : LGs incorporate effective pro-poor measures into their WSS management, and identify institutional practices to make&#13;
adequate annual progress towards the MDGs."]&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The first phase of WASPOLA (1998-2003) resulted in the formulation of a national policy framework for community­&#13;
managed WSES services. The new policy was field tested with six district-level local governments during 2002-03, since decentralization of WSS&#13;
sector responsibilities was devolved to the district level by the Government of Indonesia in the year 2001.                  With the knowledge gained,&#13;
implementation of the new policy is being further extended through a demand-responsive approach with local governments, starting in FY04.&#13;
Simultaneously, other World Bank initiatives targeting poverty reduction through improved local governance have begun working with district-level&#13;
governments. The Initiative for Local Governance Reform (ILGR)­ a World Bank Indonesia project, has been helping local governments develop&#13;
district poverty reduction strategies and action plans as a part of improving local governance.&#13;
&#13;
It is necessary to now assess how WSS issues are being addressed by local governments following decentralization, and gather lessons about how to&#13;
improve the delivery of basic WSS services to the poor in a decentralized setting. A WSS sector-focused review will be carried out for district&#13;
poverty reduction plans developed through ILGR, and the extent to which they are able to influence WSS issues in district development strategies,&#13;
plans, and budgets. A comparative analysis will be made of the results from districts participating in ILGR, districts that participated in a&#13;
WASPOLA policy implementation trial during FY04, and districts that have had no external interventions for policy improvement yet. The analysis&#13;
is expected to yield important lessons on how to improve planning, implementation, and monitoring of WSS interventions by local governments,&#13;
with emphasis on how to improve delivery of basic services to the poor in villages and small towns.&#13;
&#13;
The work will be undertaken with involvement of the inter-ministerial WASPOLA Working Group and with cross support from WB projects for&#13;
improving local governance and AAA work on poverty. A process of collaborative analysis will be utilized, in order to build awareness and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           138&#13;

Country:                   Indonesia&#13;
Partners:                  AusAID, WB, Government of Netherlands, Local Governments and rural communities.&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Improved health and quality of life for the rural poor in Indonesia, through sustainable access to, and effective use of,&#13;
clean water and safe sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: This project consolidates the cross ­support activities through which WSP Indonesia influences the course of World Bank&#13;
investments in the RWSS sector in Indonesia. During FY06 this will include the preparation of a World Bank loan (NPCWSSS) which is an&#13;
opportunity to scale up sectorwide institutional reform and programmatic sector financing, so that investments from all sources for RWSS are pooled&#13;
and managed consistently by Local Governments in line with sector policies. This will be a rare opportunity to bring together learning from WSP-&#13;
EAP's past sector analysis and research, policy formulation and pilot/demonstration projects ­ to bear on a national programmatic approach for&#13;
RWSS, in a country where rural access to services will continue to represent more than half the WSS MDG targets achievable by 2015.&#13;
&#13;
Supervision of WSLIC 2 project remains an important Indonesia Country Team activity, because this EASHD project provides an institutional&#13;
learning laboratory for the sector in 7 major provinces, serving as the channel to field innovative approaches through existing local government&#13;
institutions, e.g. setting up district-level MIS databases and capacities for monitoring access of the poor vs. the non-poor to WSS services (potential&#13;
for replication for MDG monitoring); monitoring sustainability and effective use of services; local government capacity building to scale up&#13;
community-demand-driven RWSS; accelerating sanitation access through mobilization of communitywide sanitation behavior change etc. During&#13;
FY06 this project will also provide technical supervision for an outcome assessment study in WSLIC 2 communities.&#13;
&#13;
Integration with Bank SMUs and Anchors includes activities such as participation in WB Indonesia's study identifying strategies to improve "Basic&#13;
Services for the Poor", preparation of CAS and PRSPs , selective participation in The Bank's CDD Platform and Local Governance Platforms to&#13;
make strategic conceptual and operational links between WSP's work and large scale grants/loans.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
1.   WSP-EAP's donors will continue to see the value of WSP-EAP's leveraging influence with the World Bank.&#13;
2.   WSP-Indonesia will remain adequately funded to be able to remain strategic and selective about cross-support involvement with the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
Activity description: Policy-making and strategy development will be supported by an advocacy component to stimulate awareness and public&#13;
demand through a targeted, nationwide public awareness campaign to broaden understanding of key decision makers and ordinary Indonesians of the&#13;
cumulative benefits of sanitation improvements and hygiene behavior change. This work will use a marketing approach and include: consumer&#13;
behavior surveys, the design of a high-profile sanitation campaign, and conduct market research focused on enhancing the supply of sanitation&#13;
services. It will focus on promotion and partnership by packaging market segments for financing by other potential donors, the private sector, and&#13;
government. Through this activity, the campaign will be launched, specifically targeting the urban poor in selected cities. The outcome is increased&#13;
demand and willingness to pay for sanitation and improved hygiene practices resulting in less ill-health and infant mortality.&#13;

Desired Activity Outcome: As activity 4 of ISSDP - Local level sanitation capacity building and city-wide strategies and action plans completed in&#13;
6-8 cities and lessons-learned are incorporated back into the policy framework.&#13;
&#13;
Activity description: Currently at the local level, capacity for the implementation of a national sanitation action plan is limited. Local governments&#13;
(and utilities) have had limited experience with sanitation and require support to develop a strategic action framework at the city-level for sanitation&#13;
policy, planning, budgeting, and management. This activity will focus on assisting local governments (as well as non-governmental partners and&#13;
primary stakeholders) in capacity building, needs assessment, and citywide strategy development and action planning. Through this process,&#13;
municipalities in up to 8 cities will develop an overall approach to solving the city sanitation problem and will identify priority areas for investment.&#13;
This technical assistance and capacity building components will be backed up by providing (matching) funds for municipal governments willing and&#13;
committed to investing in sanitation improvements under activity D&#13;

Country:                  Indonesia&#13;
Partners:                 Local governments, NGOs, private sector&#13;
&#13;
Desired Activity Outcome: Contribution of SSWPs to water service delivery and the attainment of the MDGs is enhanced by improving the&#13;
knowledge of GoI, regulators, financers and utilities on the role and characteristics of small-scale water providers in Indonesia and supporting the&#13;
development of appropriate policies.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Activity in the water sector in Indonesia is broadening from a focus on rural community initiatives to promoting utility&#13;
performance and developing a stronger multi-provider sector. This project fills an important gap in the knowledge and capacity of sector&#13;
stakeholders by investigating and disseminating information on the small-scale water providers (SSWPs) operating in urban areas in Indonesia. The&#13;
AAA WSS strategy identifies the need for government to capitalize on alternative forms of water supply such as alternative, intermediate, and&#13;
independent small-scale water providers that often serve the poor. WSP-EAP will conduct a study that will compile data and extend knowledge on&#13;
how SSWPs work, and develop understanding on the existing and potential interfaces with PDAMs. It will also facilitate a process envisaged to&#13;
develop the capacity of decision makers and support the development of policy recommendations for an enabling framework for small providers with&#13;
government. With key government stakeholders, the final stage will identify policy responses to enhance the potential of SSWPs in improving&#13;
access to the poor, how these actions can be operationalized, and particularly how interfaces with PDAMs can be enhanced.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: One government agency is assigned responsibility by the Prime Minister for national sanitation with a clear legal&#13;
mandate and operating a one-stop shop (internet linked) for sanitation services, such as business registration, links to private suppliers and financial&#13;
service providers, national sanitation data, resources, publications etc. (FY08).&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: There is no detailed law or regulation dedicated to roles and responsibilities for the sanitation sector in either rural or urban&#13;
areas, and the institutional framework is not yet clear. Nam Papa (the State Enterprise for urban water supply) is supposed to be responsible for&#13;
`compliance of the management of sanitary facilities with the sanitation regulation issued' in each province ­ but there are no sanitation regulations.&#13;
None of the Nam Papas are undertaking this role. Nam Saat is responsible for `environmental hygiene' in the rural and urban areas ­ but Nam Saat's&#13;
staff does not undertake this activity in urban areas due to shortage of staff and a poor definition of `environmental hygiene'. There is no political&#13;
champion for sanitation at present and the sanitation target for the MDGs has not been formally recognized by GOL. Nationally, there are no reliable&#13;
figures for sanitation coverage. GoL states summary figures of 80% urban and 44% rural latrine coverage. Figures are generally based on coverage&#13;
rather than access and effective use. The National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) sets a target of 80% latrine coverage&#13;
nationwide by 2020.&#13;
&#13;
No urban centers have access to a piped sewerage system. A small-bore sewerage pipe system, recently installed in a limited area of Vientiane is not&#13;
functioning properly because the treatment facilities are blocked by solid waste mixed with the sewerage stored in the disposal basins. In other&#13;
places, where they exist, sanitation facilities are on-site and the responsibility of the individual household. Although there are supposed to be&#13;
`model' sanitation regulations developed in the Secondary Towns Urban Development Project, these have yet to be prepared. The Urban&#13;
Development and Administration Authorities, recently set up in the secondary towns, have been given the duty to `construct, improve and maintain&#13;
the urban infrastructure area services, including sanitation and protection of the environment', but their capacity to do so is very limited. Luang&#13;
Phrabang has the only local by-laws on sanitation in the country. The four secondary towns (which include Luang Phrabang) also have guidelines for&#13;
project implementation to assist poor families that were developed by DHUP and project partners.&#13;
&#13;
The Law on Hygiene, Disease Prevention and Health Promotion was promulgated in April 2001. The MoH, provincial and municipality health&#13;
departments, and the district health offices are the agencies in charge of managing and supervising the law. Although there are few specifics about&#13;
sanitation, the law is a good starting point for developing more detailed regulations.&#13;
&#13;
GoL has requested support from WSP-EAP to address these problems through a nationally-led approach with sector partners to raise the profile of&#13;
the need for effective sanitation. This is to be done through high level advocacy, improved access to information and IEC materials, consolidation&#13;
                                                                            146&#13;

and clarification of the existing legal and institutional framework, and national consensus building to ensure that `latrine use and access is on track to&#13;
meet the NGPES target for 2020'.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   GOL will be receptive to learn innovative approaches to scaling up sanitation nationally and supportive of the initiatives&#13;
2.   Sufficient numbers of qualified and skilled government officials will be trained and available to effectively implement the proposed program&#13;
     activities.&#13;
3.   Sufficient funds will be secured for program implementation.&#13;

EWDEA/PHI/33:            Promoting Informed Choice in Sanitation                                                                          Year: 2 of 2&#13;
Task Manager:            Leila Elvas&#13;
Client:                  Local governments and utilities, external support agencies, Department of Health&#13;
Country:                 Philippines&#13;
Partners:                AusAID, GTZ, Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association, DILG, DoH, LWUA, and the MWSS&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Local governments and utilities demonstrate an increase in informed demand for low-cost sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The activity follows from the results of the national sanitation workshop, urban sewerage and sanitation (USS) studies, and&#13;
rural water models for sustainable development and sector finance studies conducted under WPEP 1. Traditional sewerage systems have had mixed&#13;
success in the Philippines, depending on the ability of the water utility or association to pursue measures of sustainability in the design and&#13;
implementation of facilities. As a result, only a marginal number have access to sewerage services. The few who are connected to sewer lines are&#13;
often unwilling to pay for the service, which is viewed as unaffordable. The USS study suggests the need to look at low-cost options for the&#13;
collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewater and relate this to a whole-of-resource (or integrated) management. On the other hand, consistent&#13;
with the global findings, demand-responsive and participatory planning and implementation were found to be key in ensuring projects are&#13;
sustainable, and relevant and affordable to their users. The proposed activity will compile a source book of on- and off-site sanitation options for the&#13;
Philippines. The sourcebook will be written from the point of view of communities, thus, it will feature typical communities (areas of population&#13;
densities) such as informal urban settlement areas, tourism areas, coastal communities, etc., and present possible suitable sanitation options.&#13;
Discussion of the options will include principles of design, policy and social mobilization issues, finance considerations, lessons arising out of&#13;
projects implemented in these options and private sector suppliers. At the same time, design of field trials would be prepared for pilot sites for&#13;
community-based consultation and planning on sanitation and WSS decision-making. These trials will seek to assist communities determine the best&#13;
possible options (technical, financing, and institutional) for a sanitation project. Training may be provided to community groups, NGOs, and project&#13;
implementers in relation to the design of a trial.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;

Indicators of Outcome:&#13;
1.   High quality (as assessed by peer reviewers in evaluation workshop/feedback form) toolkit of applicable sanitation options produced ­ Jun 05&#13;
2.   Increased awareness among LG officials and utilities' staff of sanitation alternatives, as confirmed by evaluation forms distributed during&#13;
     debriefing workshop ­ Sep 05&#13;
3.   Four communities demand appropriate, low-cost sanitation options through investment projects and design preparation resources are allocated&#13;
     by World Bank, ADB or other donors - Dec 05&#13;
&#13;
Activity Milestones:&#13;
1. Inter-agency body of government oversight agencies, practitioners and consultants are organized to direct the work of the Sourcebook to ensure&#13;
     relevance to users - Jul 05&#13;
2. Sourcebook is developed which reflects the experience of practitioners based on consultations, dialogues and community surveys and addresses&#13;
     information needs of local governments by June 2005&#13;

Country:                  Philippines&#13;
Partners:                 AusAID, GTZ, NWRB, NEDA, DoILG, DoH, National Anti-Poverty Commission, and the Metropolitan Waterworks&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcomes: DILG more effectively provides capacity-building services and investment support to local government through&#13;
enhanced demand-responsiveness and strategic communications.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WPEP 1 produced in-depth studies on the state of the sector and analyses of factors impeding sustained and equitable services&#13;
in rural, urban, and small towns' water supply and sanitation in the Philippines. The messages from these studies include: i) factors of&#13;
success/failure of WSS projects; ii) need to emphasize equity of access and effective use; and iii) importance of demand-responsiveness for achieving&#13;
the desired development impacts from scarce public investments/subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
The communication and dissemination activity originally sought to maximize the results of WPEP 1 by launching a communication program to&#13;
further disseminate the study results. However, following an assessment of the project communications environment, it was confirmed that from the&#13;
time the studies were completed up to the start-up of the consolidation period, a number of events (some supported by the project) accelerated the&#13;
progress in disseminating study findings. Thus, the need to raise awareness among sector practitioners about WPEP lessons per se became of&#13;
secondary importance to the need to support project partners implement their reform agenda through communications. This shift was reflected in the&#13;
proposed levels of intervention for communications activities in a draft Inception Report prepared by the Communications Officer and Country Team&#13;
Leader. The levels of intervention are: Regulation of Water Utilities (Institutional Level); Demand-Responsive Implementation of Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Projects (Project Level); Promotion of Other WPEP Outputs (Stakeholders Level).&#13;
&#13;
The unified project management offices under the Office of Project Development Services of DILG seeks to integrate services for enhanced demand-&#13;
responsiveness of national capacity building and investment support to local government. As a first step, the compilation and documentation of&#13;
exemplary practices arising from more than 10 years of DILG implementation would be conducted with support from WPEP. These exemplary&#13;
practices (EPs) would be collected, reviewed, documented and packaged into suitable communications format so that they could be readily used by&#13;
local governments. This would improve the replicability of these systems/practices to local governments who were not targeted during the&#13;
corresponding project phases. As part of this work, discussions will be held around what constitutes exemplary practice within the Department. It is&#13;
anticipated that this exercise will increase internal feedback within DILG and dialogue between DILG and their clients, around the improvement of&#13;
national programs to cater to local government expectations. At the end of the project when the desired output has been produced and disseminated,&#13;
the intended audience/beneficiaries are encouraged to rethink their strategies and programs on how to better serve their clients/constituents utilizing&#13;
the exemplary practices, approaches, strategies and experiences of each PMOs as benchmarks for outstanding service.&#13;
&#13;
The intended audience/beneficiaries for the dissemination of the final outputs are: DILG staff, LGU Executives, Other national government agencies&#13;
implementing development projects for LGUs.&#13;

Client:                 Small towns' utilities, National Water Resources Board, Local Water Utilities Administration, Department of the Interior&#13;
                        and Local Government&#13;
Country:                Philippines&#13;
Partners:               Australian Government, National Water Resources Board, National Economic and Development Authority, Department&#13;

                        Waterworks and Sewerage System, and the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Small towns' utilities' performance improves due to adoption of regular review processes and transparency initiatives&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: In 2003, the Water Supply and Sanitation Performance Enhancement Project (WPEP) completed a study of management&#13;
models for towns' water supply in the Philippines. The study found that successful management models for towns water supply exhibited the&#13;
following closely inter-related characteristics: cost-efficient management, active planning and expansion, professional support, good relations with&#13;
local government, and community involvement. The dynamic nature of the demography and economy of small towns presents extraordinary&#13;
challenges for water supply management. In the Philippines, efforts to maximize the benefits of ST water supply investments are leading to shorter&#13;
design periods and more incremental development of systems. As a result, strategic planning and expansion are critical elements of the successful&#13;
management of town water supply systems. The introduction of increasingly professional accounting and financial management practices has&#13;
assisted successful managers to monitor their expenditures, and to recover these costs whilst keeping tariffs low. The findings also highlight the&#13;
importance of local-level regulation, particularly for sustainable water supply provision in relatively smaller towns.&#13;
&#13;
This activity is expected to help stimulate achievement in those five areas by tracking utility performance over time and making inter-utility&#13;
comparisons. The action of benchmarking systems works on both the utility (internal) and its stakeholders (external), such as policy makers,&#13;
regulators, and consumers, who have need for better information to make decisions and take appropriate actions or lobby for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   15 water utilities are willing to participate in benchmarking and express interest ­ Jul 04&#13;
2.   Regulators, oversight agencies within GoP and industry association allocate staff and resources to participate in the activity ­ Jun 04&#13;

&#13;
Indicators of Outcome:&#13;
1.   15 ST water utilities adopt and commence process for regularly reviewing their performance and comparing these to industry best practice ­&#13;
     Dec 05&#13;
2.   GoP policy makers and regulators implements regular performance review and benchmarking to support oversight of ST utilities - Dec 05&#13;
&#13;
Activity Milestones:&#13;
1.   At least 15 small towns utilities agree to participate in the activity - Jul 04&#13;
2.   Utilities and agencies forming the benchmarking team develop respective plans of action to respond to the results of the data analysis - Jun 05&#13;

                           Domestic Capital                                                                                                Year: 1 of 3&#13;

water utilities and their associations, Local Water Utilities Administration, government and private financial institutions&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Small utilities access to market-based domestic capital financing increased in line with the GoP Water Sector Financing&#13;
Framework.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: A recent review of the water financing in the Philippines reveals that only a handful of large utilities are able to tap into&#13;
government-sources of finance, channeled through dedicated public lending to the water sector. In addition, sector financing is heavily dependent on&#13;
limited overseas development assistance (ODA). Due to currency volatility, ODA has proven to be expensive and inappropriate to meet the&#13;
magnitude of longer-term financing needs. Recognizing the huge backlog in investments, GoP introduced a reform and restructuring program for&#13;
water sector financing through Executive Order (EO 279 of 2004). One of the aims of reform is to increase the participation of commercial financing&#13;
from Government Financial Institutions (GFIs) and Private Financial Institutions (PFIs). It also calls for a "graduation policy" under which&#13;
creditworthy water service providers would begin to utilize market based finances. Increasing access by small utilities to sustainable financing,&#13;
reducing the dependence of water financing institutions on ODA and developing mechanisms to tap the domestic capital markets are key elements of&#13;
the financial reform.&#13;
&#13;
As part of the recommendations for implementing EO 279, a joint WB-WSP mission proposed an overall Water Sector Financing Framework to be&#13;
developed. The proposed framework includes the establishment of a Water Financier that would manage two funding windows: a water revolving&#13;
fund (WRF), patterned after the USA State Revolving Funds for environmental projects, and a concessional window for less- and pre-credit worthy&#13;
utilities. Philippines capital market participants agree that bond issuance by a Special Purpose vehicle (SPV) is a feasible means for raising domestic&#13;
capital. Bonds would need to be structured with a reserve fund and other security to achieve an investment grade credit rating to attract domestic&#13;
institutional investors, such as insurance companies and pension funds, that could offer longer-term tenures to match the capital needs of sector&#13;
infrastructure. In addition to the two windows, the team recommended improvements in the financing currently undertaken by GFIs and PFIs. There&#13;
are different implicit subsidies available to the GFIs that depend on the terms of the particular ODA source. A level playing field must be created for&#13;
all commercial intermediaries lending to creditworthy water service providers. This is particularly important because of the possibility of graduation&#13;
to private sources of finance exist. Future access to private sources may be significantly hindered by distortionary policies for on-lending of ODA.&#13;
&#13;
This project seeks to assist the Department of Finance to develop the overall Water Sector Financing Framework. This includes an assessment of the&#13;
feasibility of establishing the Water Financier and the market for the proposed funding windows. Technical assistance will be provided to investigate&#13;
and assess the market, financial, economic, legal and institutional feasibility of the proposed framework; and propose options for design of pilot&#13;
mechanism/transactions. The issues for investigation are: 1. financial feasibility ­ What is the character of the project pipeline from utilities and&#13;
what type of financing conditions will these require? In particular, what is the extent of access by small utilities that cater to the poor and how can&#13;
this be enhanced? 2. market feasibility - What support structure for bonds (reserve funds, depository accounts, intercept pledges , partial guarantees&#13;
by international organizations, etc) would be needed to obtain an investment grade credit rating? What additional measures would be needed to&#13;
attract purchases of bonds by insurance and pension funds? 3. economic ­ What level of risks will the economic performance play on these financing&#13;
instruments? 4. institutional - Who will manage the funds and how do we set the structure up? What role will LWUA play? 5. legal - How will the&#13;
special purpose vehicle be set-up given the various restrictions of the proposed fund managers?&#13;
&#13;
Compatibility with DFID Unlocking the Potential of the Domestic Private Sector: The proposed assessment will develop a Water Sector&#13;
Financing Framework that caters to small and larger service providers and that emphasizes development of non-traditional financing mechanisms&#13;
that will leverage market-based domestic capital by the issuance of bonds secured by a revolving fund. It will also look into the use of blended credit&#13;
(public-private) by GFIs that are now entirely dependent on ODA and the appropriate use of concessional public funds so that market finance is not&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           152&#13;

crowded out. (Output 2.2 on Market Based Financing) The analytical work that will go into this project will be of valuable instruction to other&#13;
developing or transitioning economies who are interested in setting up a long-term market-based domestic financing facility for water and sanitation&#13;
services. (Output 9.4 on Documentation) In the Philippines, should the feasibility conditions be met, the World Bank will take the analytical work&#13;
forward into project preparation to support GoP establish the WF and financing facilities. EASUR indicates that project preparation budget will be&#13;
available in FY07. WSP involvement will be lessened to providing cross-support to the Bank. (Output 8.2 Roll out)&#13;

1.   Water revolving fund and other financing mechanisms proposed are assessed to be feasible and responsive to the objectives of EO279 and&#13;
     therefore, will be established&#13;
2.   The revolving fund will attract the credit rating it needs to draw appropriate domestic capital&#13;
3.   Domestic capital is available and the market responds positively&#13;
4.   A pipeline of viable water utility projects is developed for financing by the WRF&#13;

&#13;
Project Description: On current projections, sanitation MDG targets will not be met in Vietnam. Although a strategy for rural water and sanitation&#13;
was launched in 2000, this is already dated. Urban and small town sanitation guidance is scattered between a number of different decrees. In the light&#13;
of Vietnam's rapid economic and population growth, fast changing demand for sanitation services, rapid urbanization and industrialization, and&#13;
increasingly intensive agriculture, a unified sanitation strategy is urgently needed. This has led to a strong demand from WSP-EAP's partners (at the&#13;
2005 WSP-EAP sanitation financing conference in Guilin and in other ways), for WSP-EAP to help coordinate the necessary inputs into a GoV-led&#13;
sanitation strategy development process. This will include action and capacity building plans. Institutional arrangements, (particularly lines of&#13;
responsibility between institutions and households) and the potential roles of the private sector will receive special focus. A range of sanitation&#13;
solutions needs to be catered for, reflecting varying needs and economic capacities, as well as a strategy for promotion of hygiene, particularly hand&#13;
washing Experiences from rapid donor-driven RWSS strategy development in Vietnam, and with more measured strategy support work in Lao PDR&#13;
and Cambodia, have shown the importance of process in Strategy development, in order to ensure wide ownership, early adoption and increased&#13;
likelihood of application. Initial Activities and Outputs will therefore build and model the necessary collaborative and GoV-led processes. They will&#13;
also help build the knowledge base for the effective progressive formulation of the strategy. Future activities will include the establishment of pilots,&#13;
set within or linked to large-scale investments, to model and demonstrate aspects of the Strategy's application.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.    Government confirms its request for WSP-EAP to act as the principal supporter in this initiative and other partners accept and support this role&#13;
2.    Government accepts its lead role, and urban and rural ministries, the provinces and other stakeholders agree to work together collaboratively on&#13;
      strategy development&#13;
3.    Sufficient additional funding is generated for more intensive activities in Years 2 and 3 and subsequently for new strategy-based piloting and&#13;
      investment at all levels&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: New learning from the RWSS sector has been extracted and analyzed and the results used by the GoV to make&#13;
improvements to the Strategy, to the benefit of new and ongoing investment, the improved delivery of sustainable RWSS services, and meeting of the&#13;
MDGs / VDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Vietnam launched a national RWSS strategy and action plan in 2000 with assistance from Danida. Developed in the late&#13;
1990s, the strategy is already beginning to be somewhat dated. New experiences have emerged, particularly due to shifting demands, driven by&#13;
Vietnam's rapid economic growth. This needs to be analyzed and then reflected in an update of the Strategy. An example is the growing&#13;
understanding that different rural areas of Vietnam need different management models as well as different technical solutions. There are also still&#13;
many players in the sector, and the strategy needs strengthening also in terms of coordination and harmonization, along the lines of recommendations&#13;
emerging from a recent GoV / donor joint RWSS sector review. One important area of interest, the emerging experiences from different ways of&#13;
managing piped rural water schemes, will initially be studied using the Methodology for Participatory Assessment (MPA), to gain insights from both&#13;
user and provider perspectives. This study, initiated in FY05, will not only provide useful inputs to the updating of the Strategy, but will model also&#13;
how such analytical research can be carried out, and the results used to progressively improve existing strategic guidance. The output will also be&#13;
helpful in the context of the upcoming Red River Delta RWSS project, a two-phase IDA-funded APL-based project due to commence in late 2005,&#13;
and which WSP-EAP was responsible for preparing during FY05. FY06 will also see the development of a learning plan, and initiation of action&#13;
research activities in the context of this key project.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Government and other donors express a willingness to view the RWSS strategy as dynamic and updateable and support action research as a&#13;
     means for gaining information to do so&#13;
2.   Government, Provinces, donors, operators, users and other stakeholders collaborate together in sharing experiences and extracting learning&#13;
3.   GoV and donors agree to carry out and fund the updating of the RWSS strategy and its active promotion&#13;

Partners:                 SDC, Finnida, PPIAF, World Bank operations&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Government has adopted new financing mechanisms for small town water supply and sanitation services, leading to&#13;
extension of services and improved service delivery, and contributing to meeting the MDGs / VDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: An innovative Design Build Lease (DBL) approach to the financing of small town water supplies, new to Vietnam, is being&#13;
piloted in the district towns of Lim (Bac Ninh Province) and Minh Duc (Haiphong Province). Supported by SDC, construction is planned during&#13;
FY06. A $100m+ Vietnam Urban Water Supply Development Project, to be financed by the World Bank, and also incorporating DBL, is just&#13;
underway. The first tranche of DBL contracts will be let in FY06. A Finnish-supported small towns program is also starting up which is likely also to&#13;
use DBL. These all give opportunities for progressive learning about the DBL approach and its potential in Vietnam, and for feedback to large scale&#13;
World Bank investment. FY06 activities will include identifying specific options for WSP-EAP inputs and preparing for future learning and action&#13;
research on DBL. The aim is to derive insights useful both for the projects under study and for wider application in Vietnam. In future years, the&#13;
initial focus on DBL would be supplemented, as opportunities for studying other promising financing mechanisms for small town WSS become&#13;
available.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Other opportunities are progressively identified to study and transfer learning from innovative approaches to financing of small towns WSS.&#13;
2.   Additional funds secured to expand WSP activities in this area.&#13;
3.   GoV accepts findings and makes commitment to progressively introduce the recommended new financing mechanisms and that this has a&#13;
     positive impact on rate of service extension and quality of service delivery.&#13;
&#13;

Partners:                 WBI, Ministry of Construction, VWSSA&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Capacity of GoV and supporting partners in a number of specific targeted aspects has been improved in key areas of&#13;
sector effort, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of WSS service delivery, and contributing to meeting the MDGs / VDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: There are many areas of sectoral effort that require strengthening, either from the point of view of Government or Private&#13;
Sector prime movers, or from the perspective of the support offered by partners. WSP-EAP plans to play a role in organizing training to supplement&#13;
knowledge in specific areas. Examples of gaps in understanding and capacity include defining ownership and valuing the assets of existing utilities,&#13;
tariff setting and enforcement, and control of non-revenue water. The latter example, non-revenue water, will be taken up as an initial capacity&#13;
building intervention. To be commenced in FY06, the activity will meet an urgent need for training and knowledge development through action&#13;
research on non-revenue water reduction in the urban and small towns sector. In subsequent years, the WSP-EAP effort will be supplemented with&#13;
additional interventions in the urban and small towns sector, as further capacity building and action research needs are identified.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   WSP-EAP mobilizes sufficient funds to respond to requests.&#13;
2.   Other partners also support GoV in filling capacity and knowledge development gaps.&#13;
3.   Feedback mechanisms are in place to enable correlation between improved capacity and knowledge on the one hand, and enhanced sector&#13;
     performance on the other.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Effective execution of the activities defined under this project is expected to result in partners and clients effectively&#13;
sharing experience and knowledge to achieve enhanced, sustainable services for poor people, particularly sanitation and community-based services.&#13;
Inter alia, the ministerial conference on sanitation is expected to generate increased political support for sanitation, which will be reflected in&#13;
increased national budget allocations for sanitation and sanitation-related activities. Within WSP-EAP, a common understanding and agreement&#13;
developed through annual internal retreats about strategic regional priorities and renewal of staff commitment to shared organizational values, ethics,&#13;
and goals.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The project will undertake a range of activities aimed at regional and global knowledge management in the WSS sector,&#13;
including the organization and management of regional conferences, analytical work leading to the production of high-quality knowledge products&#13;
(publications, multi-media products and contributions to websites), and contributions to inter-regional and global studies led by WSP. The focus will&#13;
be on two main thematic areas ­ optimizing strategies for scaling up sanitation improvements, and sector financing to achieve the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Core funding for the regional work program will remain available at FY05 levels&#13;
2.   Dedicated funding for Mekong regional sanitation initiatives will become available&#13;
3.   WSP-EAP staff capacity development for strategic communications and regional knowledge management, initiated in FY05, can be sustained&#13;
     with financial resources&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Increased and more effective investment into client governments' WSS sector by bilaterals, development banks, and&#13;
regional clients levered by WSP-EAP in projects and programs to achieve the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Additional external resources need to be mobilized if there will be any hope of achieving the MDGs in East Asia, and for&#13;
WSP-EAP to fully execute its mandate in the region the Program requires a more balanced and larger funding base with a significant amount of&#13;
flexible, regional financing. This project will identify and secure the regional strategic support and project funding needed to catalyze resource&#13;
mobilization for large-scale investment in sustainable and effectively used WSS services and hygiene behavior change, with particular focus on&#13;
developing new business that WSP-EAP would manage in the Mekong Region. WSP-EAP has prepared a detailed proposal for a Sanitation and&#13;
Water Partnership for the Mekong Region (SAWAP) that is aimed at:&#13;
·    Increasing the effectiveness of sector interventions through improved policies, strategies and more strategic investments, and&#13;
·    Increasing the scale of resources in the form of financing, skills, and institutional mechanisms in the sector to accelerate progress toward&#13;
achieving the MDGs.&#13;
At the request of Sida, concept papers for programs in Indonesia and the Philippines that would be linked to SAWAP have also been prepared.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP will, at the request of AusAID, also develop a proposal for a regional technical assistance drawdown fund that could be used to provide&#13;
high quality TA for AusAID's projects as well as others in the region.&#13;
New business opportunities in Timor Leste and Myanmar will also be investigated. A well-defined urban WSS business platform for WSP-EAP will&#13;
be developed in consultation with clients and partners.&#13;

Task Manager:            Nilanjana Mukherjee and, Yosa Yuliarsa&#13;
Client:                  WSP-EAP focus countries in East Asia and the Pacific&#13;
Regional:                Regional East Asia/Pacific&#13;
Partners:                WSP Global Communications Team, Donor partners&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Strengthened capacity of WSP-EAP and clients to assess, generate, and disseminate knowledge to support WSS sector&#13;
reform and advocacy for the achievement of country MDG targets.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WSP has in the past years focused on improving policy environments for WSS and developing national strategies to translate&#13;
policies into action. Strategic communication is increasingly recognized as essential for scaling up the adoption and implementation of improved&#13;
sector policies and strategies. Strategic communication capacities exist within the private sector but tend to be low or non-existent within client&#13;
government systems. The project aims to enhance WSPEAP support for client capacity building in focus countries to communicate effectively with&#13;
stakeholders for scaling up the operationalization of sector reforms ­ in order that client countries achieve the WSS MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
An important advocacy event to take the Sanitation MDG agenda forward in the focus countries is the East Asia Ministerial Conference on&#13;
Sanitation, proposed for Dec. 2006. This project will integrate with the regional project preparing for that event. (Regional Knowledge products).&#13;
&#13;
Sector partners in large-scale projects have expressed a need for a "toolkit" of sector reform advocacy materials and approaches to help inform and&#13;
encourage local governments and utilities to implement policy reforms. The project will assess and compile "best practice" to develop such a toolkit.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Increased funding for communication capacity development in country budgets&#13;
2.   Availability of funding for regional communication support activities&#13;
3.   Availability of staff with strategic communication skills and experience in regional and country teams&#13;
&#13;

Task Manager:             Rick Pollard&#13;
Client:                   Governments of Cambodia and the Philippines&#13;
Region:                   EAP&#13;
Partners:                 EASUR, EWD, DFID&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Client countries in EAP are able to leverage increased financial and technical inputs from the domestic private sector to&#13;
improve the scale and rate of progress towards the WSS MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The objective of this project is to increase sustained access to improved water and sanitation services for poor people in EAP&#13;
by unlocking the constraints that block the development of an effective and optimized water market.          The various components of the proposed&#13;
project are therefore structured around the key aspects that determine the operation of the market place: the supply side of the market ­ unlocking the&#13;
potential of small and medium service providers through mechanisms that enable their improved capacity to serve poor people; the demand side of&#13;
the water market ­ unlocking the potential of the consumer base to demand better service and hold service providers accountable; and the enabling&#13;
environment (the policies, regulations, institutions) that impacts on the way the market operates.&#13;
&#13;
This regional project, which contributes to the global Domestic Private Sector Participation Initiative, will implement a strategy that aims to develop&#13;
opportunities and entry points with Bank Task managers and the Water anchor to leverage IFI investments in local PSP in the region, particularly in&#13;
Cambodia and the Philippines. Much exploration into local PSP has already taken place in the region and the next step is to roll out initiatives in&#13;
Bank investments in the urban and rural water sectors. To this end, all activities are linked to World Bank or ADB activities and are demand-led by&#13;
country partners, offices and/or links with Bank operations. At the same time the activities will contribute to the global learning agenda and broader&#13;
objectives of the global program. Apart from the activities focused on local impact, the effort will ensure coordination and exchange with other&#13;
regions, and contributions to global outputs.&#13;
&#13;
Activities will be focused predominately on Finance and sanitation marketing within the streams on Domestic Finance and Local Private Sector&#13;
Providers:&#13;
1.   Domestic Private Sector Providers (market-related activities) ­ concerned with improving the efficiency and effectiveness of small and medium&#13;
     private providers (SMPPs) themselves through strategies and supporting instruments,&#13;
2.   Domestic Finance ­ concerned with facilitating access to domestic capital markets for: (i) utilities/LG and (ii) small scale providers to improve&#13;
     access to finance for water and sanitation service delivery to the poor. This will include the development of the policy and regulatory&#13;
     environments, and local level capacity building necessary to promote access to market-based finance.&#13;
&#13;
These correlate with, and provide deliverables for, the global Domestic Private Sector Participation Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Local entrepreneurs continue to be interested in engaging in the water sector.&#13;
2.   GDP in focus countries maintain existing trends and public financing of infrastructure is constrained for the foreseeable future.&#13;

Partners:                 WB Operations, water sector institutions, SDC, sector coordination group&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Improved and more sustainable RWSS services through strengthened institutional capacity at national, regional, and&#13;
local levels and supporting the sector decentralization process.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Recently in Peru, legislation has been approved to support the decentralization process, providing local authorities with new&#13;
resources as well as new responsibilities such as service provision guarantee, quality and sustainability assurance. However, the decentralization&#13;
process is still in an early stage due to incipient capacity of municipalities to assume their roles. Therefore, WSP-LAC will provide technical&#13;
assistance to sector institutions at different levels to help move the decentralization process forward. Within the project context, WSP-LAC will&#13;
continue providing support and acting as facilitator of the sector coordination group. Among the pending issues that will be specifically addressed by&#13;
this group are the following:&#13;
1.   Update the current regulation of the Water and Sanitation Law, or eventually issuing a new one in line with the institutional changes resulting&#13;
     from the decentralization process.&#13;
2.   Support the design and implementation of a Sector Information System (SIS or SIAS) with training activities, recording sector needs and&#13;
     coverage at rural and urban levels working together with PROSIAS Committee.&#13;
3.   Strengthen municipal and regional capacities to support access to water and sanitation services in rural areas, in Cusco (SANBASUR) and in&#13;
     Cajamarca (PROPILAS). Lessons learned from these two projects will be systematized in order to help the sector with specific regionalization&#13;
     and decentralization issues. Roles will be clarified with PRONASAR.&#13;
4.   At the request of the DNS, WSP will provide direct technical assistance to strategy development to the Vice Ministry&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   CIDA will accept to provide financial support to 2 regional governments.&#13;
2.   Regional governments have the capacity to respond quickly to donors requests.&#13;
3.   Sector authorities are receptive to WSP proposal based on lessons learned.&#13;

EWDAN/PER/26:             Strengthening Local Capacity for WSS Provision in Small Towns in Peru                                             Year: 3 of 4&#13;
Task Manager:             François Brikké, Oscar Castillo&#13;
Client:                   VMCS, regional and local governments&#13;
Country:                  Peru&#13;
Partners:                 CIDA, local NGOs and implementation firms&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Lessons learned from STPP will contribute to the development of a national strategy to improve WSS services in&#13;
small towns.&#13;
Project Description: Small towns in Peru are defined as settlements with populations ranging from 2,000 to 30,000 inhabitants. About 650&#13;
municipalities fall within this category, with a total population of 4.1 million inhabitants. Of these, 500 municipalities manage their WSS directly,&#13;
while the remaining municipalities are under the administration of a water utility. Preliminary studies on WSS in small towns show that there are&#13;
critical management conditions, causing deteriorating infrastructure, lack of continuity, high percentage for unaccounted water, insufficient revenues&#13;
to meet the O/M costs, lack of appropriate systems for wastewater collection, and reduced impact on dwellers' health and living standards.&#13;
WSP-LAC, with the financial support of CIDA, is implementing a pilot project with the general objective of supporting dwellers from Peruvian small&#13;
towns to have access to quality and sustained WSS services, with a positive impact on their health and living standards. The pilot project results will&#13;
be used to define intervention models in the Small Towns Component of PRONASAR, a WB-funded project, and other initiatives.&#13;
To achieve the expected outcomes, the project's four-year implementation strategy includes the supporting the development of national policies and&#13;
strategies for WSS provision in small towns, working directly with 10 municipalities to strengthen WSS management and infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation, applying innovative management models, and providing TA to a maximum of six municipalities through associated organizations, and&#13;
carrying out systematic activities for learning, documenting and disseminating knowledge, promoting the exchange of experiences and strengthening&#13;
sector networking.&#13;
The following activities will be developed during the third year of the project:&#13;
&#13;
1. Sector institutional strengthening: Institutional strengthening will focus on improving local government capacities to monitor service quality. To&#13;
this end, a service monitoring plan will be designed and municipal authorities and users represented in the Service Control and Surveillance Unit will&#13;
be trained. In addition, three municipalities will receive support directly or through a partner organization in the implementation of socioeconomic&#13;
studies of their services and the preparation of their service development plans. This activity will be complemented by support to three university&#13;
research projects addressing institutional, legal, technological or infrastructure issues in the sector. The results will be shared with PRONASAR.&#13;
&#13;
2. Sector assessment: Last year, a study was carried out and small towns were identified nationwide, with support from the HYTSA ECSA&#13;
Consortium. The results will be analyzed and published this year. This study is the first of its kind to present an overview of service coverage and the&#13;
main challenges facing small towns in the country, which have a total population of 4.1 million. The qualitative and quantitative data will serve as a&#13;
reference for decision-making in sector institutions.&#13;
&#13;
3. Sector Information System: This activity will continue during the third year. The project is supporting the National Sanitation Directorate (DNS)&#13;
in the development of a joint work plan with other cooperation agencies (CIDA, the German Technical Cooperation Agency- GTZ- and COSUDE)&#13;
through a PRO-SIAS Committee, in an effort to organize a SIS to provide data on coverage and key indicators of the situation of services. This year,&#13;
the project plans to support the DNS in preparing a proposal for the general design of the SIS and to validate the system in a national workshop with&#13;
sector institutions.&#13;
&#13;
4. Management model identification and tool development: This is the first such effort in the country. Throughout its implementation, this component&#13;
will identify lessons learned, which will be transferred to institutions of the sector. These lessons are being included in a manual and five intervention&#13;
guides, which will serve as a reference for more than 500 municipalities that face similar problems in sustaining their water and sanitation services.&#13;
The manual and the guides will serve as tools in the process to change the service management model in the different localities.&#13;
&#13;
5. Low cost alternative technologies identification and dissemination: In service delivery and the expansion of service coverage in small and&#13;
medium-sized towns, there is little emphasis on the use of non-conventional technologies that permit lower service delivery costs and that are&#13;
compatible with the protection of water resources and the environment and are also easy to operate and maintain. The introduction of new&#13;
technologies requires efforts to disseminate, validate and persuade users and authorities to adopt them. To this end, events, workshops, seminars and&#13;
forums are planned to disseminate non-conventional water and sanitation technologies such as the condominial system and the different wastewater&#13;
treatment systems.&#13;
&#13;
6. Implementation and validation of management models: The main objective of the Small Town Pilot Project (STPP) is to validate new service&#13;
management models through the contracting of a "specialized operator," in accordance with the legal and institutional framework of the sector. For&#13;
small town municipalities, this is an innovative experience because it represents a challenge in terms of the exercise of the capacity for contracting a&#13;
specialized operator; of promoting community participation in all processes and decisions; monitoring the new operator; and strengthening the&#13;
capacity for medium-term strategic planning to improve service infrastructure, among others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                             164&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FY06 Project Sheets                                                                                                            Latin America/Caribbean&#13;
During this third and final year of the project, at least seven specialized operators should be hired in seven municipalities that are participating in the&#13;
project. The project will support this process through the design of a health and hygiene promotion strategy and the implementation of a cross-cutting&#13;
gender focus.&#13;
&#13;
7. Rehabilitation works: During the third year of the project, support will be provided for the rehabilitation of service infrastructure in the 10&#13;
participating municipalities. The STPP is a project designed to support a change in management; however, there is also a small component to support&#13;
infrastructure improvements known as "impact work." This component provides an incentive to the towns that have approved service development&#13;
plans and have decided to change their management model. To implement the component, the project will identify an NGO recipient which will&#13;
receive approximately US$ 1.3 million. These NGOs will then transfer funds to municipalities to improve water and sanitation infrastructure, in&#13;
accordance with the work priorities identified in their service development plans. Municipalities will have one year to use the donated funds.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Community will be responsive to a social approach in the change of WSS services management models.&#13;
2.   Local private entrepreneurial will be interested in being small scale providers.&#13;
3.   Central government will be consistent with its sustainability and Social Public Private Partnership (SPPP) policy.&#13;
4.   Local governments will accept to empower the community to change WSS services management models.&#13;

Partners:                 WB Operations, NGO CESAL, public and private institutions participating in the sector coordination group&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Several cities implement improved technology and management models based on the PAC SEDAPAL experience and&#13;
lessons learned.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The project seeks to address the lack of access to safe WSS of a large portion for urban dwellers. In metropolitan Lima, alone,&#13;
more than 1.2 million people are not connected to the SEDAPAL network because of increase of peri-urban population and lack of SEDAPAL&#13;
capacity to undertake investments to cope with the increasing demand. To achieve the WSS MDGs and fight poverty, the sector must be able to&#13;
promote and adopt new models and to address both technology and management issues in order to allow significant cost reduction and long-term&#13;
sustainability. In this context, WSP-LAC will continue supporting the implementation of SEDAPAL project PAC [what does this stand for?] to&#13;
extend water and sanitation networks to Lima's peri-urban areas, using condominial technology, in coordination with WB operations. WSP-LAC&#13;
will also support the systematization, documentation, and dissemination of this experience in coordination with partners such as CESAL in order to&#13;
replicate SEDAPAL experience in other cities.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   PAC second phase funding available&#13;
2.   Identifying a champion in SEDAPAL to take the reforms forward&#13;
3.   Willingness among other utilities/cities to adopt new management models&#13;
&#13;
Start date: Jul 04                                      End Date: Jun 07&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Reduce incidence of diarrheal disease through the adoption of the appropriate practice of hand washing among targeted&#13;
population, through an increased public awareness.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The MoH reports treatment of seven hundred thousand cases of diarrhea in the age group of children under 5, which represents&#13;
about 20% of the total amount of cases. About two thousand children die every year due to this disease. During the previous year the coordination&#13;
mechanism and the financing of the project have been consolidated and the Ministry of Health has taken over leadership of the campaign. The role of&#13;
WSP-LAC will now be to facilitate the implementation process. WSP-LAC seeks to do the following in Peru:&#13;
1.   Implement the communication campaign: nationalize the mass media campaign and the direct contact/ interpersonal communication effort.&#13;
2.   Strengthen regional partnerships with participation of both private and public partners.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome:          The GoB adopts and begins implementing a policy and strategy incorporating communication and improved&#13;
management for the provision of sustainable WSS to ST in Bolivia&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The water and sanitation sector in Bolivia is going through a difficult period, characterized by the lack of confidence of users&#13;
and the population in both its government and water sector authorities. In addition, the management of water supply in most cities, small towns and&#13;
urban areas is not satisfactory. It is a fact that social participation is a must in any new water sector project or policy. In the meantime, the Vice&#13;
Ministry of Basic Services in Bolivia has developed a new financial policy to support investment in the sector, and developed FUNDASAP,&#13;
responsible for promoting sustainability of projects in rural areas. In FY05, WSP-LAC has carried out a study on the participation of private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12including a CTF of $45,000, and JSDF incremental costs of $42,000&#13;

operators in small towns and has been actively discussing with various technical agencies and sector authorities on needs and priorities in the sector&#13;
in Bolivia. The present government has accepted the proposal of having WSP-LAC support the Vice Ministry in developing a communication&#13;
strategy and improving the management of water supply and sanitation services in small towns with the participation of local authorities, private local&#13;
operators, and the civil society. WSP-LAC is developing terms of reference for these potential projects and is in negotiation with CIDA in order to&#13;
finance this project. The FY06 plan is focusing on starting communications activities and upon funding will study the possibility of consolidating its&#13;
presence in the country.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Strengthened capacity of rural communities to manage the water supply and sanitation systems in a sustainable way.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: In the FY05 WSP has carried out a sustainability study in 95 rural communities in Ecuador that was disseminated and approved&#13;
by MIDUVI. The study has shown the poor level of sustainability of WSS systems in rural areas. As a result, and in negotiation with WSP,&#13;
MIDUVI has expressed the wish to strengthen the capacity of rural communities in managing the RWSS systems. A proposal has been made by&#13;
MIDUVI, and financing is being sough for a national capacity building campaign at this level. A WSP consultant is presently working on the design&#13;
of capacity building campaign and it is proposed that a consultancy goes on in order to ensure potential implementation if funding is approved. The&#13;
project will make sure that there is an active collaboration with the PROAGUAS programme.&#13;

EWDAN/REG/36:             Improving access to WSS for urban poor in seven cities of Latin America                                           Year: 2 of 3&#13;
Task Manager:             François Brikké&#13;
Client:                   Municipalities and local health departments&#13;
Region:                   LAC&#13;
Partners:                 Seven municipalities, WB, IADB, bilateral donors, and the private sector&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: To increase awareness of municipalities and utilities on how to improve the provision of WSS services to the urban poor&#13;
in seven cities of Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Urbanization is one of the over-riding trends of the Latin American region. It is estimated that approximately 75% of the&#13;
population lives in an urban area. The rapid increase in the urban population goes hand-in-hand with the even faster development of shanty towns,&#13;
favelas or pueblos jóvenes in all cities of the region. Given the tremendous need to improve water and sanitation services in low-income urban areas,&#13;
the WSP has begun discussions with institutions and organizations from seven cities of Latin America regarding the possibility of reinforcing local&#13;
and national existing efforts. This would take place through the assessment of ongoing experiences in each of the cities and an inter-city exchange&#13;
initiative. This exchange assumes that every city can learn from others in terms of institutional, financial, social, and technical set-up. This project&#13;
was well received by various institutions in the seven cities contacted: Tegucigalpa, Managua, Medellín, Guayaquil, Lima, La Paz or Santa Cruz and&#13;
Brasilia. WSP is launching a first phase of this project with research, bibliographical and field research in the seven cities. The initial study in the&#13;
seven cities will have to identify the cities on which are more specific program will be done.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Funding will be available for the next phase for at least two cities, and also for a major international workshop on water supply and&#13;
     sanitation for urban poor.&#13;
&#13;
Start date: Jul 04                                            End Date: Jun 07&#13;
&#13;
Indicators of Outcome:&#13;
1.   At least two LAC cities have adjusted their municipal strategy in order to improve sustainable and equitable access of WSS services to low-&#13;
     income urban areas ­ Jun 06&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: WSS MDGs are integrated into sector regional policy&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: In June 2003, CANs Foreign Ministers approved the Andean Plan of Johannesburg which established actions that should be&#13;
implemented between 2003 and 2005 in three business lines: weather change, biodiversity and water and sanitation. These actions reflect their&#13;
commitment to achieve the MDGs. In this context, the General Secretary of the Andean Community of Nations (SGCAN), CEPIS/PAHO and the&#13;
WSP/WB have joined forces in August 2004 with 2 main goals: provision technical assistance to develop a WSS reference document for the Andean&#13;
region and develop an Andean-Amazon participatory strategy on the water sector that will be presented at the Mexico 2006 World Water Forum.&#13;
WSP has contributed already to the development of a initial sector document that was analyzed by the CAN Minister Conference in April 2005. The&#13;
document needs further development and a consultation group between all the five Andean Countries needs to be established, in order to exchange&#13;
information, set priorities for MDGs achievement and develop the proposals.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Donors are willing to support the development of the initiative&#13;
2.   Ministers continue to support the initiative after Mexico 2006&#13;

EWDAN/REG/38:            Exploring and Promoting Future Components of WSP-LAC Agenda                                                Year: Ongoing&#13;
Task Manager:            François Brikké&#13;
Client:                  Sector authorities in WSP-LAC focus countries&#13;
Region:                  LAC&#13;
Partners:                Sector government authorities and TA agencies&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Consolidate future components of WSP-LAC agenda in line with sector demands&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: In order to better respond to sector needs and achievements of the MDGs in the region, and to expand WSP-LAC regional&#13;
agenda, it is proposed to carry out exploratory activities concerning potential future orientations of WSP-LAC in the region on several key issues.&#13;
These are issues that WSP-LAC has experience with or that have emerged in countries where WSP-LAC is working. These key issues are the&#13;
following:&#13;
 1.   MDG road mapping                                                     2.   Implementation of reforms and decentralization&#13;
 3.   Background info on SWAPs                                             4.   Monitoring of MDG achievement&#13;
 5.   WSS service provision in small towns                                 6.   Rural sanitation&#13;
 7.   Hand washing Initiative                                              8.   Community management of watersheds&#13;
WSP will conduct exploratory activities such as situation analysis through internet search or interviews with key informants and donors on one&#13;
specific issue each. These assessments would cover the LAC region or a specific country of intervention for WSP-LAC. Additionally, it can also&#13;
imply the organization of a one-day seminar on one of the specific issues that would have both a knowledge management and a promotion objective.&#13;
These rapid assessments could also provide some information for the ACCESS e-newsletter.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Political will from national governments to go ahead with new issues&#13;
2.   Cooperation with other TA agencies on new issues&#13;

authorities)&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Client knowledge and capacity is enhanced on key sector issues through improved access to quality and appropriate&#13;
information.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: One of the reasons why achievement of the MDGs is hampered is because the right people are not getting the right information.&#13;
This can be improved through appropriate knowledge management. Knowledge management refers to generating/collecting key information;&#13;
processing, filtering, and adapting contents to specific target groups; packaging it according to demand; and disseminating and making it accessible.&#13;
Main audiences (target groups) in Latin America are partner governments, sector networks and collaborative committees (e.g., RRAS-CA,&#13;
RASHON, RASNIC, Caudal, etc.) comprised of public/private/international aid institutions working in the water and sanitation sector, which&#13;
coordinate joint actions to build synergies. Based on the results and recommendations of the WSP-LAC readership assessment undertaken during&#13;
fiscal year 05 this project aims to:&#13;
a.   enhance the knowledge management capacity in the sector at all levels by filling information gaps and demands;&#13;
b.   expand audiences (who target neglected sector players) that require sector knowledge for decision making and learning;&#13;
c.   reinforce the articulation and coordination of sector networks such as RRASCA, RASHON, RASNIC, CAUDAL, sector committees, and&#13;
     resource centers such as CINARA, CEPIS, universities, national libraries;&#13;
d.   build capacity among partners and sector networks for knowledge management; and&#13;
e.   better position and strengthen WSP-LAC by improving its services related to knowledge management and communications.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Clients are committed to knowledge management and demand support for communication activities.&#13;
2.   Sufficient capacity within WSP-LAC, partners, and clients&#13;
3.   Other sector partners are willing to engage with this initiative&#13;
&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: GoN develops, adopts, and begins implementing a national sector strategy that features a special focus on&#13;
decentralization, sanitation, and peri-urban.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WSS in Nicaragua is still undergoing the profound reform launched in 2001. The GoN is currently focused in strengthening the&#13;
institutional and normative frameworks to improve coverage and quality of WS services aiming to reach MDGs. Priorities are to strengthen&#13;
CONAPAS (Water and Sewerage National Commission) as head of the water sector and the preparation of a WS Strategy 2005 ­ 2015, both aiming&#13;
to guide the sector development. The strategy includes decentralization of WSS, definition of financial mechanisms including a SWAP, policy&#13;
proposals to reach the poor with quality WSS. Within this framework, WSP has agreed with CONAPAS to provide technical assistance in the&#13;
following three business lines:&#13;
1. Developing a WSS decentralization strategy in ST and rural areas, and subsequently operationalizing it.&#13;
2. Assessing the sanitation best practices and developing a sanitation MDG strategy.&#13;
3. Transferring regional experiences and preparing a strategy and roadmap for peri urban areas.&#13;
Activities will be discussed with partners throughout bilateral meetings and workshops to keep them informed on advances and limiting factors.&#13;
Results are also expected to be adopted in projects financed by partner's organizations&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Continuous political support from the GoN to proceed with the WSS sector reform.&#13;
2.   Willingness among the allied institutions to support the sector reform.&#13;

Partners:                SDC, WB, IDB, KFW, GWP, UNDP, UNICEF, ACDI&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The four countries of CA (Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala) have adjusted their sector policies in&#13;
reaching the WSS MDGs through the adoption and implementation of MDG strategies and roadmaps.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The four main WSP-LAC countries in CA - Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua - are amongst the poorest in the&#13;
northern hemisphere, with only Haiti having a lower Human Development Index.               Local governments are now challenged with increased&#13;
responsibilities for the provision of water supply and sanitation (WSS). WSS provision is often hampered by limited in-country experience with&#13;
public-private partnerships, and obsolete norms and regulations, both of which limit the ability to scale up the provision of sustainable WSS.&#13;
FOCARD-APS a regional organization of CA countries, and the WS regional network RRAS-CA, with support of SDC have decided to address&#13;
these issues and invited WSP-LAC to provide technical assistance in the following three lines: i) policy support oriented to the development of&#13;
roadmaps to reach MDGs, ii) knowledge management including new financial tools such as SWAPs, sector information management (SIS), rural&#13;
and small towns management models , and iii) networking strengthening among water sector key actors of the four countries, including civil society&#13;
representatives.&#13;
Key stakeholders in each country will be the local network RRAS-HON, RAS-NIC, RAS-ES, and RAS-GUA becoming focal points for the project.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.  FOCARD-APS agrees to adopt and promote proposed sector reform principles.&#13;
2.  Sector authorities' willingness to adopt and implement strategy at country level&#13;
3.  Main donors support the promotion and adoption of the strategy&#13;
4.  Local WS networks express willingness to participate in the project&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Decentralization strategy is imbedded within local policies, strategies, and activities, and GoH begins implementing the&#13;
reform&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The recently-approved WSS Law in Honduras (Oct 03) is an effort to help build normative and regulatory institutions, define&#13;
their responsibilities as well as those of the institutions providing WSS and the users themselves. The GoH is also in the process of preparing a WS&#13;
mid­ and long term "Water and Sanitation National Plan" funded by a PPIF and The World Bank support. The new law includes decentralization as a&#13;
principle for water and sanitation provision. The GoH and bilateral agencies have requested WSP-LAC support to: a) Advocate for WSS sector&#13;
reform, including the WSS Law and National WSS Plan, through a series of participatory discussion events, b) Transfer regional experiences and&#13;
prepare a strategy and roadmap for WSS in peri-urban areas, c) Developing a WSS decentralization strategy in ST and rural areas, and subsequently&#13;
operationalize it, d) Discuss innovative technologies to reach the poor with quality WSS.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Reduce incidence of diarrheal disease through the adoption of the appropriate practice of hand washing among targeted&#13;
population, through an increased public awareness.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Although Colombia has achieved substantial reductions in child mortality,13 the costs associated with diarrhoeal morbidity&#13;
from contaminated water and inadequate hygiene in both children and adults are high. Human excreta are the source of most diarrhoeal pathogens&#13;
and washing hands at the right time can significantly improve health. Diarrhoea remains to be de second cause of death among children under five&#13;
years of age and almost 1,600 children die every year due to this disease. WSP-LAC is seeking to increase knowledge on hygiene behavior and HW&#13;
practices at populations at risk in order to better design the HW Initiative in the future. WSP-LAC will monitor activities through a coordinator that&#13;
has been hired in Colombia. The Coordinator will also have the responsibility to secure additional sources of funding. WSP seeks to build a PPP to&#13;
promote hand washing with soap to reduce children diarrhea, design and start the creative process of a communication program business plan and&#13;
launch it.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.  Community will adopt and implement the initiative&#13;

Client:                   National, regional and local governments and local operators&#13;
Country:                  Bolivia&#13;
Partners:                 Groups of the civil society, Vice Ministry of Basic Services, private operators, donors&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: All stakeholders involved in the water and sanitation sector are contributing to sector performance in an organized and&#13;
structured way, owing to the implementation of a communication strategy, with an emphasis on the involvement of the domestic private sector and&#13;
civil society.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: This multi-annual project is based on the assumption that communication helps to improve sector performance, and that the&#13;
lack of a good communication strategy has been one of the factors that lead to the present water crisis in Bolivia. A Communication Strategy aims to&#13;
provide the broad framework that guides communication on the reforms and identifies the issues that need to be addressed to build understanding and&#13;
generate support for the reforms. Three sets of activities are proposed:&#13;
&#13;
The first consists in a situation analysis that will analyse: a) the levels of awareness, fears and understanding of the reforms and involvement of the&#13;
private sector; b) consumer satisfaction with current performance of water and sewerage services and their involvement in the sector debate; c) the&#13;
enabling environment concerning domestic private sector participation; d) the use of various communication channels (press, radio, web) and its&#13;
impact at local level; e) the way the civil society is organized to express its opinion and its willingness to contribute to the sector debate and&#13;
development; f) the presence of a domestic private sector market.&#13;
&#13;
The second component will consist in the participatory development of communication strategy seeking to increase awareness, improve knowledge&#13;
and build support for water sector reforms among key stakeholders that includes the promotion of the domestic private sector, as well as the&#13;
development of dialogue mechanisms and structured civil society. The third component consists in the implementation of the communication strategy&#13;
together with relevant stakeholders in particular FUNDASAB.&#13;
&#13;
As a result of this communication, a promotional and awareness raising ­ capacity building plan will be prepared and implemented subsequently.&#13;
&#13;

Task Manager:            Iris Marmanillo&#13;
Client:                  National and local governments and local operators&#13;
Country:                 LAC&#13;
Partners:                DFID, private operators and government counterparts in 10 LAC countries&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Key factors of success of domestic private sector participation in the delivery of water and/or sanitation services have&#13;
been identified and differentiated by peri-urban, rural areas, small and medium-sized towns in ten countries of LAC.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description:&#13;
The project will assess existing experiences of domestic private sector participation on the small and medium scale in W&amp;S service delivery in the&#13;
countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. The analysis will be developed taking into account the different levels of relative development of the&#13;
countries. The 10 countries are categorized in the table below:&#13;
&#13;
                              Group                                            Countries&#13;
                              I. Countries with higher income                  Chile, Argentina&#13;
                              II. Countries with intermediate income           Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia&#13;
                              III. Countries with lower income                 Paraguay, Honduras, Bolivia, Nicaragua&#13;
&#13;
The study will examine the following topics:&#13;
1.  Assessment of W&amp;S service delivery: information analysis to compare the situation before the participation of the operator and the current&#13;
    situation. The assessment should include the situation of the service, investments, financing and fees (previously and currently).&#13;
2.  Regulatory framework: analysis of the legal framework, policies and strategies of the sector, with an emphasis on financial and regulatory&#13;
    policies, including regulations, types of reports used, the established regulatory process and rules of the game of private sector participation (tax,&#13;
    legal stability and other issues).&#13;
3.  Institutional framework: analysis of the conceding entity (legal capacity, functions, etc.), of the private operator (complete or partial operations,&#13;
    functions, responsibilities, etc.), roles of the different actors and level of decentralization in decision-making.&#13;
4.  Market sizes: from a legal standpoint and intervention areas.&#13;
5.  Investments and financing: analysis of local financing of investments, municipal financial capacity and level of fiscal decentralization.&#13;
6.  Fees and subsidies: analysis of policies that define fees and what they cover, subsidy policy, and whether policies are implicit or explicit.&#13;
7.  Private participation: analysis of the different stages of the process and the operational phase.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
6.  DFID provides financial support to develop the assessment in the LAC area.&#13;
7.  National, regional and local governments have an interest in developing the DPSP (Domestic Private Sector Participation) market.&#13;

   urban areas of the country's main cities, and in small and medium-sized towns, as well as, in concentrated rural areas. Based on the assessment&#13;
   results, proposals will be prepared to promote the generation of a friendly environment to support the growth of the market of domestic operators.&#13;
   For each market segment to be identified and based on the analysis of types of existing domestic private operators, financial and investment&#13;
   policies, institutional and regulatory framework, fee schedule and the promotion of local private investment, a matrix will be developed that will&#13;
   summarize the results of the analysis and proposal to serve as a tool in decision-making for sector, regional and local authorities.&#13;
&#13;
 II. Learning best practices and domestic operators capacities This component objective will be focused on learning best practices and domestic&#13;
   operators capacities through specific case studies relaying on primary information sources and field visits to representative segments of the market,&#13;

Partners:                DFID, private operators, donors&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Generate the conditions in the institutional, regulatory and legal framework to promote domestic private sector&#13;
participation on a small and medium scale in Peru to facilitate sustainable access to water and sanitation services of the country's poorest population.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The multi-annual project will begin with the evaluation and identification of participants of the different areas to subsequently&#13;
coordinate the remaining project activities with sector authorities. This project would benefit from the inputs and additional resources of both the&#13;
"sanitation is a business" project of COSUDE and of the results of the seven city project as far as Lima is concerned.&#13;
&#13;
 I. The first is the evaluation of the current situation of domestic private sector participation in peri-urban areas of the country's main cities, and in&#13;
  small and medium-sized towns outside the area of the municipal service operators, as well as in concentrated rural areas. Based on an assessment,&#13;
  proposals will be made for a future situation that permits the generation of a favorable environment to promote the growth of the market of local&#13;
  operators. For each market segment and based on the analysis of types of existing private operators, financial and investment policies, institutional&#13;
  and regulatory framework, fee schedule and the promotion of local private investment, a matrix will be developed that will summarize the results&#13;
  of the analysis and proposal to serve as a tool in decision-making for sector, regional and local authorities.&#13;
II. The second component will be a detailed study of specific cases using mainly primary information sources as well as the participatory&#13;
  development of specific strategies for DSP in each area and emphasis on market generation / consolidation. The project will develop the following&#13;
  case studies and project proposals in detail:&#13;
     ·    Two cases in the urban slums of the City of Lima, whose service delivery is the responsibility of SEDAPAL , one on sanitation and one on&#13;
          water supply&#13;
     ·    Two cases in the low-income areas of large cities, whose service delivery is the responsibility of the service operators of large&#13;
          municipalities&#13;
     ·    Two cases in medium-sized and small cities&#13;
     ·    Two cases in concentrated rural areas&#13;
&#13;
    III. The third component includes activities to promote domestic private sector participation in each one of the cases.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   DFID provides financial support to develop the assessment in the LAC Area.&#13;
2.   National, regional and local governments are interested in developing the DPSP market.&#13;
3.   Sector authorities are receptive to the WSP proposal based on lessons learned.&#13;
4.   Private operators are willing to provide the information required for the study.&#13;
5.   The project has the support and collaboration of The World Bank professionals to achieve results.&#13;

Client:                   GoB, LGs, DPHE, NGOs, and development partners&#13;
Country:                  Bangladesh&#13;
Partners:                 Local Government Division, SDC, DFID, Netherlands Dev. Corp., WAB, Plan BD, DAM&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The Government of Bangladesh improves the national sanitation program through effective involvement of&#13;
local government institutions and GO/NGO agencies in implementation of sustainable total sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Sanitation coverage in Bangladesh lags far behind the safe water coverage and has traditionally received less attention&#13;
and resources compared to water supply. However the Total Sanitation movement, pioneered by WaterAid and other partners, has been able to&#13;
change this attitude. The South Asia Conference on Sanitation (SACoSan), co-sponsored by WSP-SA, was held in Dhaka in Oct 03 and the&#13;
GoB has subsequently set a target of achieving countrywide total sanitation by 2010. To assist the GoB, WSP-SA have been working with&#13;
with the Plan Bangladesh and Dhaka (Plan BD) Ahsania Mission to launch a local government-based pilot project on promoting sanitation,&#13;
building on the successful Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) model.&#13;
&#13;
The project supports:&#13;
·    Development of an upazilla-based model of total sanitation steered by the Union Parishad and with the participation of the local&#13;
     departments of the government, NGOs, and communities, with implementation in six selected upazillas through a local government-steered&#13;
     and community-managed planning, implementation, and monitoring mechanism.&#13;
·    Development of local resources and skills and enhancement of local government capacity.&#13;
·    Dissemination of learning from the experience with the government and other partners so that the model can assist the GoB in&#13;
     implementing countrywide programs for eradicating open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Local government institutions receive necessary support from the central government&#13;
2.   Massive natural disasters (such as floods) do not occur&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: National arsenic mitigation policy and alternative service delivery mechanisms in place, including technical options&#13;
to address arsenic contamination.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The main source of drinking water supply in Bangladesh is groundwater, which serves 97% of rural community by using&#13;
handpumps and tubewells. The discovery of arsenic in the groundwater has affected nearly a third of the water supply system. There has been a&#13;
shift of approach from household-level interventions to community-based water supply schemes, supported by several community-based pilot&#13;
schemes in recent years. Lessons from Bangladesh and the region have been documented by WSP-SA with World Bank (SASES) and DFID&#13;
(APSU). This project will disseminate findings on operational responses to arsenic, support GoB and partners to operationalize the National&#13;
Arsenic Policy, and provide technical support to mainstream innovative approaches and institutional arrangements for efficient and sustainable&#13;
water supply.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   GOB Steering (Secretary level) Committee remains active and supportive&#13;
2.   Large scale project implementation progressing satisfactorily, without major set backs&#13;
3.   GOB continues with its strategy towards decentralized service delivery&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Policy makers/utilities promote/adopt key monitoring and evaluation tools to improve service provision, especially&#13;
for the poor and marginalized customers.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The GoB and other stakeholders have identified lack of adequate management capacity as a major reason for poor&#13;
performance of urban water supply utilities. Benchmarking is recognized as an effective tool for performance monitoring and formulating&#13;
subsequent performance improvement programs. In a workshop held in Dhaka in December 2004 on Institutional Reform for Utilities,&#13;
benchmarking was introduced and a number of participants expressed interest in initiating a benchmarking exercise.&#13;
&#13;
This project will provide technical and management capacity support to clients to understand and initiate effective benchmarking practices. Key&#13;
activities will include advocacy to promote the concept of benchmarking and performance improvement amongst key sector stakeholders,&#13;
facilitating discussions at GoB level to set up a Steering Committee to coordinate and oversee the exercise, capacity building of DPHE and&#13;
select cities/pourashavas to measure and understand critical performance indicators through focused training seminars, compilation and analysis&#13;
of data from a select sample of 4-5 cities/pourashavas, dissemination of results and facilitating a discussion on taking benchmarking forward as&#13;
part of integrated performance improvement plans.&#13;
&#13;
The exercise will also include ways to measure, monitor and benchmark WSS services for all forms of service provision whether formal or&#13;
informal. Appropriate indicators will be developed for evaluating the extent of involvement by small scale independent providers/domestic&#13;
private sector in select cities/pourashavas. These will include measures to capture the monthly amount paid by poorer households for WSS,&#13;
including for services obtained from small scale service providers, and the extent to which the utility is contracting out or otherwise partnering&#13;
with the local private sector and NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Increased thrust on developing performance monitoring systems as part of urban WSS and local govt. reforms&#13;
2.   Cities/Pourashavas willing to provide data and participate in performance improvement program&#13;
3.   GOB willing to provide fiscal incentives to Pourashavas to undertake performance improvement plans&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Sector Coordination strengthened through consensus building among sector partners, increasing the effectiveness&#13;
and efficiency of WSS investment and service delivery, and improving access of the poor&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Although the GoB finances a major part of the development and recurrent budgets for the sector, several donors actively&#13;
support technical assistance and investments. With the discovery of arsenic in shallow groundwater in a third of the country, the donor support&#13;
to the country has been on a steady rise to assist with immediate-, mid-, and long-term strategies. The WSP in Bangladesh has assisted the GoB&#13;
and sector donors to prepare an institutional response that overcomes policy inconsistencies and centralized agency capture, which are&#13;
hampering efforts to address water quality and service delivery problems. Poor sanitation both in rural and urban low income communities, is&#13;
another challenge and WSP's response is to inform the GoB and sector stakeholders of successful local &amp; regional experiences, support these&#13;
being mainstreamed and help scale up Total Sanitation throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
This project provides an effective platform for a coordinated and convergent sector policy and strategy to improve the efficiency of service&#13;
delivery and effectiveness of sector monitoring, with a special focus on making services work for the poor. WSP will adopt and use the WDR&#13;
2004 as the analytical framework to build consensus among the development partners, GoB policy makers and public and private service&#13;
providers to develop appropriate mechanisms that separate the policy maker from service providers, strengthen client power and voice to&#13;
monitor service providers, provide feedback to policy makers and enable providers to respond to client demands.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Continued interest by GOB and key sector donors in sector coordination&#13;
&#13;

Indicators of outcome:&#13;
1.   GoB National Forum for WSS fully operational, providing effective direction for sector policy and strategy ­ Jun 06&#13;
2.   National Water and Sanitation Policy Unit operational ­ Jan 06&#13;

&#13;
Project Update:      These activities were earlier included under Project EWDSA/BA/3.Spun off as a separate project in FY05. Sector&#13;
coordination is a continuous process, and the project will specifically focus on promoting DRA and decentralized service delivery principles&#13;
among new stakeholders, partners, donors. As Co-chair of the LCG sub-group for water and sanitation WSP will continue to foster better&#13;
synergy among sector actors through inputs and informing the proposed GOB National Policy Support Unit (PSU). Finally, the project will&#13;
facilitate cross-sectoral initiatives and mobilize resource support needed to prepare and launch decentralized service delivery projects.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Increased understanding of the long term sustainability and impact of Total Sanitation on economic, social, health&#13;
and productivity of rural communities and improved capacity of the GOB to undertake impact assessment.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: At SACOSAN 2003, the Government of Bangladesh declared its goal of achieving total sanitation in rural areas by 2010.&#13;
The background of the ambitious goal is successful examples of Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) pilots in a large number of villages.&#13;
Although CLTS has proved to be highly effective, it will only be replicable if local governments are involved on a large scale.             Key&#13;
stakeholders involved in the CLTS initiative have launched upazilla-based total sanitation projects, but do not have the analytical tool to&#13;
measure their impact.&#13;
&#13;
The project will support rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of CLTS at village level, especially the sustainability of behavioral changes,&#13;
based on the new strategy of involving the local government institutions under the upazilla-based total sanitation projects. Random case control&#13;
methodology will be used over a study period of about 2-3 years to measure intervention impacts over time. Areas of specific investigation&#13;
include: a) the effectiveness of community participation on collective action to induce and sustain positive sanitation behavioral change; b) the&#13;
impact of collective community behavioral change on the reduction of fecal contamination in villages c) elimination of open defecation and&#13;
over a sufficient time period to demonstrate irreversible behavioral change and the overall impact on the reduction of child morbidity/mortality&#13;
and medical expenditure, and the improvements in nutrition and productivity.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.  Total Sanitation projects are implemented according to the principles tested in pilots.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Efficient service delivery arrangements in place based on an improved understanding with the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government and sector agencies of different options, including decentralization, private sector participation and restructured utility agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Urban WSS service delivery is inefficient and inadequate and arsenic contamination has made water quality a major&#13;
concern, especially for the urban poor. Centralized utilities with weak institutional and financial management operate in isolation instead of&#13;
within city-wide urban management frameworks and are unable to address problems appropriately and on scale. Reforms are necessary to&#13;
improve efficiency and service coverage, as well as financial and expenditure management. The project aims to assist the GoB Ministry of&#13;
Local Government and lead urban sector agencies to pursue reforms and explore options including institutional and fiscal decentralization,&#13;
private sector participation and governance rules to make utility agencies accountable and efficient.&#13;
&#13;
The project will provide strategic assistance by:&#13;
a)   Supporting policy dialogue, sharing lessons, and propelling global knowledge through the newly established Global Practice Team (GPT),&#13;
     and&#13;
b)   Influencing large-scale investment projects.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Political will to contract service providers is sustained;&#13;
2.   GOB lead agencies (DWASA, CWASA, DPHE) continue to support PPP under the World Bank projects;&#13;
3.   Local Governments (Pourashavas) are willing to contract service providers;&#13;
4.   Private service providers are available, have suitable capacity and are willing to participate&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Implementation capacity of NGOs and communities established to mobilize finance and deliver large scale&#13;
rural water supply with the involvement of local governments.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Rural water supply is primarily provided by small scale private providers through extracting shallow ground water&#13;
by handpumps and other point sources. However, arsenic contamination has reduced access to potable from 95% to 76% over the past year.&#13;
The arsenic crisis, increasing densification of rural settlements and availability of handpumps close to households has raised the demand for&#13;
better service levels and safe water. At the same time greater capacity of small scale providers and NGOs delivering water and sanitation&#13;
services and an increase in micro finance Institutions (MFIs) in rural areas has opened opportunities for private operators to deliver&#13;
community water supply through capital cost sharing and full recovery of the operating cost. GOB and the World Bank with assistance&#13;
from SDC and pilot projects by WSP-SA under BAMWSP and SIPP, prepared the large scale Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project&#13;
(BWSPP) to provide nearly 300 villages and a few small towns with piped water, using private operators/sponsors (NGOs, Contractors,&#13;
CBOs) with 50% capital cost mobilization.&#13;
&#13;
Under this project WSP will:&#13;
·    provide BWSPP-focused capacity building to project partners, including local governments, to address challenges in planning,&#13;
     financial management, project management and monitoring &amp; evaluation and to NGOs/Sponsors to prepare, implement and manage&#13;
     community water schemes.&#13;
·    support implementation of BWSPP.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   GOB central agencies and national politicians do not intervene with project implementation, and allow local governments and communities&#13;
     to take charge of implementation.&#13;
2.   NGOs/sponsors are available and willing to prepare, implement, and manage community water schemes.&#13;
3.   Communities are willing to continue paying capital and operating costs.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: Improved understanding and capacity of national, state and local government officials and service providers of technical&#13;
and institutional options for provision and scaling up municipal services in urban slum communities that is considered for policy shifts in this&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: With support from international agencies, cities have achieved positive results in piloting slum upgrading projects without&#13;
working directly with utilities and service providers. Cities have demonstrated pilots on slum upgrading either by focusing on improving the&#13;
legal standing of slums, thus removing legal and administrative hurdles to service provision, or by mobilizing local communities to raise the&#13;
voice of the poor, increase their political weight, and ultimately facilitate their access to services. There is a growing realization of the need to&#13;
address the challenge of "going to scale" on providing access to adequate services in water and sanitation services. With service provision&#13;
central to the improvement of living conditions in slums irrespective of land tenure status, utilities ultimately are responsible for it, and there is&#13;
little that can be achieved without their goodwill. The main objectives of this project are to facilitate scaling up for citywide service provision&#13;
through advocacy support at the state and city levels and explore innovative approaches by which the role of utilities is transformed from&#13;
`opponents' to `contributors' to service provisions in slums. In addition, the project will develop an understanding on the ways and means by&#13;
which these institutions could contribute in providing WSS services irrespective of informal and unclear land tenure arrangements. The project&#13;
is aimed at knowledge creation and approaches at two levels: a) to have a better understanding of why utilities resist servicing slums and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         189&#13;

identify ways and mechanisms by which utilities can provide appropriate services to unserved areas, and b) to understand the triggers of better&#13;
integrating infrastructure planning and land management as metropolitan areas continue to sprawl exponentially with poor, informal and ad hoc&#13;
services in place. This in-depth analysis will enhance sectoral understanding and facilitate pro-active engagement of utilities and service&#13;
providers. As part of its assistance strategy to utilities and governments, WSP-SA will undertake the development of a policy and institutional&#13;
framework to enable improved delivery of UWSS services to the poor. This task includes:&#13;
·    Assess current service practices and policies and facilitate cross learning.&#13;
·    Design and test of institutional arrangements of service delivery primarily through support to municipality &amp; service providers tools for&#13;
     advocacy and capacity building.&#13;
·    Develop tools for advocacy and capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   National and state government's policies and legislation do not prohibit project activities.&#13;
2.   There exists political will to accept innovative solutions to include the poor into formal service delivery frameworks.&#13;
3.   Poor communities and clients have credibility and to become active partners.&#13;

Partners:                 SASEI, SASES, SIDA, AusAID&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Broad consensus on roles of different tiers of government, institutional reform structures, appropriate technologies&#13;
and private sector participation options to achieve the objectives set in a revised &amp; realistic national environmental regulation in a cost effective&#13;
and sustainable manner. Cities and State governments on the basis of this National consensus take to implementation of SWM system&#13;
upgardation in at least three States.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Municipal solid waste management is an essential but often neglected part of urban management. Inefficient collection&#13;
methods, insufficient coverage of the collection system, combined with improper disposal of municipal solid wastes are major threats to public&#13;
health and environmental quality. Municipal solid waste services in most cities in India lacks planning, financial management and budget&#13;
                                                                         190&#13;

control functions and is institutionally fragmented. Efforts are required to improve solid waste systems, which include appropriate levels of&#13;
technical assistance and capacity support in the operational, institutional, financial and technological aspects. International best practices will be&#13;
shared with exchanges will be set up to stimulate change in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the International experience support provided in the last three years SWM is in the verge of becoming the first reforming sector, within&#13;
the gambit of local body services. Widely significant investments have been made on technologies for waste collection and disposal; however&#13;
this has been happening in the absence of adequate institutional reform to support the upgraded service levels leading to unsatisfactory&#13;
outcomes. Although currently there are a variety of technical resources available to local bodies there is limited understanding on institutional&#13;
and governance reform issues which are essential for sustainable sector transformation plans. This project aims to develop the knowledge base&#13;
in India on context specific institutional and governance issues that are essential to SWM sector transformation. WSP therefore plans to work at&#13;
all levels of government to understand, document, analyze, assist solve, critical institutional bottlenecks faced due to lack of role clarity,&#13;
information, separation of powers, to set in place robust frameworks at all levels which would incentivize comprehensive, durable solutions.&#13;
&#13;
This project is structured into three activity sheets to engage at the Central, State and Local Government levels. This project aims at tightening&#13;
the feedback loop from implementation lessons at the local government level to policy dialogue at the Central and State level. The content and&#13;
strategy of each intervention is laid out in the next sheets. Through its engagement in the SWM sector WSP- SA not only is responding to strong&#13;
client demand but is also furthering reform in the sanitation and urban water supply sector.&#13;
&#13;
The institutions in charge of delivering sanitation services are the same as that in the SWM sector at the National, State and local body level and&#13;
institutional / governance reform agenda for the urban solid waste and sanitation sectors are similar, making the work in SWM an entry point for&#13;
wider sanitation reform. Also in a increasingly decentralizing environment, urban local bodies are being encouraged to take on a stronger role in&#13;
urban water service delivery; this intervention in SWM will make the local bodies i) more responsive to reform issues ii) increase their capacity&#13;
to deliver improved services in general and iii) provide a plethora of local options/examples of institutional reform, which will go a long way to&#13;
enthuse UWSS reform in the future, also building up WSP's credibility among a wide urban client base.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   The Supreme Court of India does not retard systematic intervention in the MSW sector&#13;
2.   MoUD, GoI takes up an proactive role to address issues in the MSW management sector&#13;
3.   WSP manages to raise the required funds to work with MoUD on guidance notes.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: GoI creates and begins implementing an explicit and consistent approach to SWM through creating an enabling framework&#13;
across the country, after initial discussions with MoEF, MoUD, MNES, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Although the policy environment for the MSW management sector has seen quick developments in the last couple of&#13;
years, there is a long way to go before a balanced policy environment for the sector across all sizes of towns is formed. The development in the&#13;
policy environment grew out of a public-interest litigation which has resulted in the Ministry of Environment and Forests taking the first step&#13;
and implementing the MSW (M&amp;H) Rules 2000, as a part of the Environment Protection Act. Besides this, the Ministry of Non-conventional&#13;
Energy Sources (MNES) supports projects through financial aid which generate energy out of MSW.. MoUD has yet to formulate its role in&#13;
creating an interface between other GoI arms, in an environment where "sliver bullet" technology solutions being peddled by private sector&#13;
technology providers are being seen as the solution without the understanding that sustainable SWM is an operation-oriented service and would&#13;
require robust and durable institutional structures which are not in place currently. At the implementation end however, lessons are just&#13;
beginning to be learned on institutional options, financing mechanisms, monitoring arrangements, feasible technical standards etc, which need to&#13;
inform the policy framework. At the GoI level the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is in a process for reviewing the MSW rules and&#13;
authorization framework, simultaneously the MoUD is confronting the problem of providing support to municipalities on challenges facing the&#13;
municipalities in upgrading service delivery in the sector, which is plagued by institutional hurdles that are hindering sustainable segregation&#13;
and primary collection at the front end and robust strategies for disposal at the other. In this scenario there is an eminent need to provide a&#13;
consistent policy framework and rationalize both standards as well as processes for developing realistic and implementable SWM systems which&#13;
meet the needs of the long-term goals of the sector. This activity is aimed at assisting the GoI through support (participation in committee&#13;
meetings, knowledge exchange, and specific assistance) to: a) CPCB committee reviewing the MSW rules 2000, b) The MoUD to develop&#13;
guidelines on Institutional strengthening and reform for better SWM.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   The supreme court of India does not hinder systematic intervention in the MSW sector&#13;
2.   The MoUD and CPCB are successful in garnering other GoI depts. and stakeholders into a credible policy dialogue.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: At least one State Government develops a MSW policy which is backed by appropriate state level policy frameworks and a&#13;
competent knowledge sharing and support platforms.&#13;
&#13;
Sub Project Description: Simultaneously to the creation of a consistent policy environment at the GoI level, the operative policy framework&#13;
for sustainable SWM especially in medium and small towns and rural areas needs to be at the state level. Although the state government's role&#13;
in the current policy environment is quite restricted mainly as approvers of landfill site locations and monitoring through the State Pollution&#13;
Control Boards, in reality state governments often bear a large share of the financial impact of SWM services provided by the ULBs. Given this&#13;
scenario, state governments need to have a more coherent role at this time when the sector is posed for large upgradation investments. Also&#13;
state governments would need to play a strong role in providing technological and management support to ULBs, which are often restricted by&#13;
capacity constraints. Towards this end the project intends to engage a state govt. to demonstrate the catalytic role that that tier of government&#13;
can play towards developing sustainable SWM systems. To demonstrate the criticality of state government intervention this project aims to work&#13;
with at least one State government to develop a state wide policy and strategy for MSW management. To be effective the revised regulations,&#13;
institutional and financing options and other guidance developed at the GoI level will need to be communicated to implementing agencies at the&#13;
state and municipal level to though a robust dissemination and training mechanism through strong partners. This project will also support the&#13;
development of information exchange, dissemination and training mechanisms&#13;
&#13;

Desired Outcome: Cities and towns embark on long term and sustainable planning, of the sector after being better informed about the&#13;
advantages and limitations of various models based on comparative standards, of SWM being implemented in other cities across the country and&#13;
abroad.&#13;
&#13;
Sub Project Description: SWM service provision has always been a statutory obligation of urban local bodies. However, since the MSW rules&#13;
2000 of the Environment Protection Act were implemented the specifications and service standards that need to be adhered to in SWM service&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       193&#13;

provision have been increased substantially. The EPA sets forth strict deadlines for implementation of these standards. The supreme court has&#13;
also set up a monitoring committee to track the progress in this regard. No city/town in the country has managed to meet the demands made in&#13;
the MSW Rules 2000, as yet. However cities and towns across the country are struggling with the challenge of implementing SWM systems&#13;
which meet these stringent implementation demands. A number of interesting and early examples of failures and successes in the varied&#13;
components of the SWM system are beginning to emerge all across the country due to the large number of parallel efforts by each ULB to try&#13;
and deal with the same policy directive. Although the large number of parallel efforts have led to a plethora of options, most efforts lack&#13;
integrating the different components of the system and do not create durable long term support mechanisms. This project will document and&#13;
analyze the major institutional options emerging and disseminate the results for a larger and more informed debate on SWM among&#13;
implementers in the country. This would be invaluable as many approaches are now mature enough to be studied and the lessons shared. Some&#13;
towns, especially the smaller ULBs, have developed innovative approaches, but face both human and financial constraints in rolling out the&#13;
implementation process, thereby inhibiting development of new models. There is an active need to provide small pushes to this initiative to&#13;
ensure that the model gets implemented and is available for wider discussion and learning. This dissemination is expected to help reduce the&#13;
learning curve of all ULBs in their effort to implement new SWM systems. Based on this learning, this project will also solicit new city/district&#13;
level engagements. To further reduce the learning curve and to allow for quicker processes, some successful examples would be further&#13;
elaborated by creating model contract documents and assist setting up monitoring and evaluation methods based on output based technical&#13;
specifications. The project will also support Networks of practitioners across size and class of cities/towns with varying geographical area&#13;
coverage, demand for better services, etc. initially through the Megacities forum. This project will document the various SSIP (often organized&#13;
as CBOs and NGOs) initiatives in this sector across the country based on an analytical framework which would focus mainly on scaling up and&#13;
replicability. The role of the civil society in demanding accountability for SWM service, is in an early stage of development as far as monitoring&#13;
the service is concerned. This project will also look at developing a framework to articulate the Civil Society role in community monitoring.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: GoI adopts and begins implementing an improved fiscal framework for sustainable and equitable delivery of urban services.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Fiscal and financial approaches to the funding of UWSS have a significant effect on the incentives faced by service&#13;
providers to deliver efficient and sustainable services to poor communities. The current intergovernmental fiscal framework reduces incentives&#13;
for efficient and customer-responsive service delivery and undermines the sustainability of investments. Transfers often crowd-out private-&#13;
sector capital from the WSS sector and fail to enhance service delivery to poor households. Central government incentives to induce&#13;
institutional and fiscal restructuring by service providers are counteracted by existing infrastructure funding mechanisms that can mitigate&#13;
against these objectives. GoI is seeking to adjust these incentives through the introduction of the National Urban Renewal Mission (NURM).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                        194&#13;

The project will support central government to fine-tune the design and coordination of reform incentive, infrastructure funding schemes and&#13;
financial frameworks at central level and assist state governments to develop or support complementary fiscal and financial initiatives to assist&#13;
local service delivery reforms. These instruments continue to evolve and WSP-SA will offer ongoing policy advisory support to ensure effective&#13;
operation, coordination and evolution of these schemes as WSS reforms deepen. This will enhance the understanding among sector staff of&#13;
MoUD, MoF, State and Local governments of the impact of fiscal and financial practices on the provision of UWSS and on incentives for&#13;
reform, including the impact on UWSS of current approaches to intergovernmental fiscal relations, the role and limitations of reform-oriented&#13;
fiscal incentive schemes at central government level and improved understanding of distributional impacts of subsidy approaches. This activity&#13;
includes follow-on work to city level rapid assessments that support central-level reform design efforts. This activity will: a) Support fiscal&#13;
restructuring to incentivize reforms through intergovernmental fiscal reviews of WSS and development of reform options, and support to&#13;
development of fiscal incentives for reform (NURM), b) Support central government in the management of incentive schemes, c) Support&#13;
World Bank study on achieving the MDGs: Assistance to World Bank in undertaking a review with GoI of the fiscal and institutional challenges&#13;
facing India in meeting the water and sanitation MDGs through developing a sector profile for urban India.&#13;

Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Adequate detailed information is available and accessible&#13;
2.   The momentum for fiscal accountability is sustained at the Central and State Government levels, and adequate progress is made by GOI in&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: Increased understanding of the constraints to market-based financing available for urban infrastructure in India.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Fiscal and financial approaches to the funding of UWSS have a significant effect on the incentives faced by service&#13;
providers to deliver efficient and sustainable services to poor communities. Central government incentives to induce institutional and fiscal&#13;
restructuring by service providers are counteracted by existing infrastructure funding mechanisms, including sub-national borrowing practices&#13;
pursued by domestic development finance institutions that can militate against these objectives. This activity is part of a larger project that will:&#13;
a) support fiscal restructuring to incentivize reforms through intergovernmental fiscal reviews of WSS and development of reform options, and&#13;
support to development of fiscal incentives for reform (e.g., NURM), b) support central government in the management of incentive schemes, c)&#13;
Support central government to review current lending practices from the private and public sectors, d) support World Bank study on achieving&#13;
the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
HUDCO and LIC have traditionally been the prime lenders in the WSS sector but commercial banks are not active. Instances of private&#13;
investment in cities have been few. In almost all instances, the borrowings have been supported by a formal State Guarantee or through a Letter&#13;
of Comfort, backed by assurances of State level intercepts for repayment. In many instances, the intercepts have been the primary source of&#13;
repayment for these loans. In view of the need to develop a commercial approach to lending and the increasing importance of fiscal prudence&#13;
amongst the states (and a consequent capping of the absolute levels of outstanding guarantees that they can issue), there is an emerging need to&#13;
review the appraisal and lending practices of the major financial institutions. Also, since most of the lending to the sector happens through govt.&#13;
owned/public sector agencies with limited competition, there is a need to compare the practices and procedures of these institutions to best&#13;
practices in the market.&#13;
&#13;
This activity will support central government to review lending practices of the major financing institutions ­ public sector, joint sector and&#13;
private sector ­ that lend to WSS sector in India. Key such institutions include the HUDCO, LIC, IDFC, IL&amp;FS, NABARD, etc. and will&#13;
include the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
·    Review current lending practices of select public sector financing institutions supporting urban infrastructure projects to identify possible&#13;
     constraints to commercial financing&#13;
·    Review experience with other urban infrastructure financing mechanisms that have been applied in India since the mid-90's to introduce&#13;
     commercial financing practices and facilitate discussion on accelerating movement towards international best practice (e.g., credit ratings,&#13;
     municipal bonds, guarantees)&#13;
&#13;
These activities will draw on past and ongoing technical assistance initiatives of World Bank, ADB, USAID and others.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Adequate detailed information is available and accessible&#13;
2.   GOI recognizes the need to reduce non-market based lending for urban infrastructure.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: Increased awareness of sector representatives from MoUD, state governments, local bodies and service providers of best&#13;
practices in sector policy and management and reform, through partnerships with national institutions targeting key sector policy-makers and&#13;
stakeholders and awareness strategies that will assist in the design and implementation of strategies to improve service delivery, as also&#13;
increased awareness amongst these stakeholders and civil society to facilitate institution of downward accountability mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Weak institutional structures and inadequate client capacity to conceptualize and design sustainable service delivery&#13;
models are some of the key challenges facing the water sector in India. This project aims to influence the preparation and implementation of&#13;
credible reform programs through providing best practices and approaches to policy makers and stimulate debates on key issues facing sector&#13;
reform efforts. This will be achieved through a combination of learning events (workshops, networking and study tours / exchange visits) and&#13;
support to partner institutions supporting reforms. This activity will include a) Support to partner institutions for capacity building programs, b)&#13;
Sponsored learning events, c) Support to strategic exchanges (through study tours, learning events and seminars) within India.&#13;
&#13;
This activity would also be the vehicle for taking forward the on-going partnership under the social accountability network with various&#13;
stakeholders (i.e., community representatives, NGOs, utilities, government officials and donors). It is planned to use the network to share&#13;
experiences and disseminate information documented by WSP with a view to shape larger WSS policy and institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Capacity of partner institutions sufficient to sustain efforts to support reforms&#13;
2.   Credible requests from state Govts/utilities and approval from GoI&#13;
3.   Stability of political and administrative leadership in reforming utilities.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Effective policy and regulatory environment developed to establish appropriate operating context for domestic&#13;
private sector participation in several state/local government WSS sector transformation plans.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: The activity will deepen the understanding of policy makers, service providers, and consumers about different institutional&#13;
reform approaches to create a constituency for reform and strengthen the prospects for initiatives aimed at improving UWSS services in a sustainable&#13;
manner through institution of role clarity/separation, conducive incentives/ownership and accountability in service delivery, by undertaking and&#13;
disseminating studies on specific topics. The activity consists of three sub-studies which, upon completion, will be disseminated through national&#13;
workshops in FY06. Smaller consultation workshops may be held during the finalization of each of the sub-studies. The following sub-studies are&#13;
planned:&#13;
a)   Documenting sector transformation strategies for creating accountability and incentives for performance improvement: The strategy&#13;
would identify options available for transforming highly centralized/unified UWSS institutions into accountable/incentive-driven structures. The&#13;
study would be embellished with experiences from India and abroad and create the framework for introducing comprehensive policy and regulatory&#13;
reform. Among other things, the strategies would specifically address establishment of an appropriate operating context for domestic private sector&#13;
participation.&#13;
b)   Documenting Urban WSS sector reform experience under Private and Public sector management: Critical analysis of several case studies&#13;
covering successful and failed PSP arrangements in India. Analysis will cover (i) assessment of prevailing policy, political and institutional&#13;
conditions prior to PSP; (ii) key restructuring actions and structure of PSP transactions; (iii) process of securing PSP; and (iv) performance to date.&#13;
Similar studies will be carried out for 3 reform interventions in the UWSS sector in India under public sector management. Each case study will&#13;
specifically review the transaction in light of service improvement for the poor, including an analysis of existing service arrangements for the poor,&#13;
including through small scale/informal providers; whether the transactions included targeted interventions to the poor and, if so, how effective these&#13;
have been; whether there is scope within the transaction for participation of small scale independent providers; and whether obstacles to improving&#13;
service to the poor have been effectively addressed.&#13;
c)   Assistance to GoI on PSP Guidelines for UIDS/Viability Gap Scheme: As follow up to workshops on UWSS sector reform and PSP&#13;
guidelines in FY05, assist GOI in developing guidelines for emerging infrastructure funding schemes such as UIDS and viability gap funding.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: Policy makers/utilities promote/adopt key monitoring and accountability tools, including benchmarking, facilitating&#13;
accounting systems, revenue enhancement approaches, concurrent cost control/tracking systems and downward accountability mechanisms for&#13;
performance enhancement that help them improve service delivery for all, especially the poor and marginalized customers. This objective is&#13;
enhanced through increased awareness and adoption of downward accountability mechanisms on the part of Governments, Service Providers,&#13;
NGO's and Communities to strengthen and institutionalize channels of citizen voice and client power and improve service delivery standards, as&#13;
reflected in relevant measurable indicators.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description:&#13;
a)    Develop and disseminate benchmarking strategies with supporting utility accounting practices (Anupam): The water sector in India&#13;
needs to improve its performance to match international standards with respect to O&amp;M, quality of service provision, financial health,&#13;
management systems and governance. While some states/utilities perform better, other states lag behind in many respects, which ultimately&#13;
adversely impacts the services they provide. WSP-SA initiated the project for Performance Benchmarking of WSS in selected urban utilities in&#13;
South Asia in partnership with Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD), GoI, and the Indian Water Works Association (IWWA). The project&#13;
targeted creating awareness about the practice of information sharing and benchmarking amongst water utilities, and its benefits for the water&#13;
sector as a useful tool for improving sector performance. As part of Phase I, performance data were collected from 13 utilities covering 23&#13;
cities/towns in India and a detailed analysis carried out to identify key performance trends across utilities. A national workshop was organized to&#13;
disseminate the findings of Phase I. This benchmarking process would help in generating credible comparative information about performance&#13;
levels on a regular basis and analyzing trends systematically for improving sector performance.&#13;
&#13;
The Phase II model as originally envisaged has been modified for FY 06. In the revised plan for Phase II, it is intended to ­ i) explore a&#13;
limited and more focused scale up involving only selected Phase I utilities supported with wider dissemination and advocacy across new&#13;
utilities, ii) support efforts to develop an institutional model for undertaking benchmarking at the national level in the context of the&#13;
National Urban Renewal Mission (NURM) and iii) undertake "Drill Down" benchmarking exercises in 1-2 states as part of WSP&#13;
operational engagements.&#13;
&#13;
Also, while the focus of Phase I of the project was on benchmarking the performance of selected utilities, going forward the concept will be&#13;
expanded to develop ways to measure, monitor and benchmark WSS services for all forms of service provision whether formal or informal.&#13;
The initiative will be broadened to develop indicators appropriate for evaluating the extent of involvement by small scale independent&#13;
providers/domestic private sector in select cities. These will include measures to capture the monthly amount paid by poorer households for&#13;
WSS, including for services obtained from small scale service providers, and the extent to which the utility is contracting out or otherwise&#13;
partnering with the local private sector and NGOs. In this regard, it is also felt that this initiative will result in improved performance&#13;
reporting for WSS services as a whole and consequently assist financing/lending agencies develop a better understanding of the issues&#13;
involved in funding small scale informal providers.&#13;
&#13;
Apart from benchmarking WSS service provision, activities will also be undertaken to develop activity based accounting standards for&#13;
utilities to underpin benchmarking efforts through generation of consistent and relevant operational and financial data. The approach&#13;
developed will be field tested in two states/utilities.&#13;
&#13;
b)    Develop and disseminate approaches for Utility performance improvement: (Pronita): Many Indian water utilities and service&#13;
providers are under severe financial distress, with insufficient funds for routine maintenance, replacement, and expansion, the result being poor&#13;
and worsening quality of water services across the country. This financial distress is a result of a number of factors including inefficient&#13;
operations, poor levels or absence of metering, poor billing and collection practices, and most importantly, the absence of a commercial&#13;
orientation to service delivery. This activity will:&#13;
      (i)   Document and disseminate mechanisms through which utilities, globally and in India, have undertaken performance improvement&#13;
      management strategies through measures aimed at improved internal organizational accountability for better cost recovery, reduction in&#13;
      system losses and improved service quality. This would include approaches for improving performance through financial health tracking&#13;
      options, effectively charging for water (metering and flat rate charging), effective billing and collection practices etc. on the basis of&#13;
      prudent tariff setting guidelines (which would be identified).&#13;
      (ii) Prepare and disseminate guidance note on the technical, financial, commercial and institutional issues involved in the provision of&#13;
      24/7 (continuous pressurized) water supply. This has particular relevance in the context of the fact that most Indian cities have intermittent&#13;
      supply even when water availability is not a constraint. This has serious implications for contamination of water in the distribution pipes,&#13;
      functionality of meters and overall service quality. The prevailing mindset in India, even in academic institutions, essentially views 24/7&#13;
      water supply as a largely infeasible goal. This makes it critical to demonstrate the feasibility of 24/7 supply through practical guidelines&#13;
      supported by real world examples.&#13;
      (iii) Approaches to performance agreements between the utility and policy makers/regulators would be documented and disseminated,&#13;
      along with prudent templates of such agreements.&#13;
&#13;
These outputs would be disseminated extensively and applied in the course of operational engagement in at least two Indian utilities.&#13;
&#13;
c)    Document and disseminate institutional mechanisms to enhance downward accountability (Badal): To date, reforms in WSS services&#13;
have been designed and instituted with the notable absence of any significant consumer participation, even though the instituting authorities ­&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         199&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FY06 Project Sheets                                                                                                                                          South Asia&#13;
government, service providers, potential financiers ­ universally accept that consumer participation is necessary for undertaking and sustaining&#13;
deep and meaningful reforms. There is an urgent need for the emergence of credible demand-side (or consumer) institutions to shape public&#13;
policy, to balance relations between service providers and customers, and help generate new efficiencies of local service delivery and use,&#13;
especially in the case of poor consumers.&#13;
&#13;
The project had supported case studies to examine the role and significance of certain mechanisms of downward accountability in the Indian&#13;
urban environment. As a follow up to this work, WSP-SA seeks to document credible downward accountability mechanisms to strengthen&#13;
citizen voice and client power, including models of community and citizen participation in service delivery. It also plans to disseminate this&#13;
information among Government functionaries, Service Providers, NGO's and Citizens with a view to shape larger WSS policy and institutions.&#13;
This work is likely to include application of these methods in the course of operational engagements.&#13;

Desired Outcome: Demand-responsiveness, customer-orientation, and accountability in service provision increases through state governments&#13;
and utilities incorporating and implementing systematic consumer information approaches into utility transformation plans and PPP transactions.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Among the main challenges facing the WSS sector is a lack of systematic information to enable the delivery of efficient,&#13;
demand responsive and accountable water and sanitation services. The project aims to inform and support the preparation and implementation&#13;
of mechanisms of accountability through credible information systems and best practices. This will be achieved through a combination of&#13;
pilots, survey-based studies, and learning events (workshops, networking, and study tours/exchange visits). There is growing realization that the&#13;
`demand side' perspectives, including consumer preferences and affordability aspects are necessary inputs for designing improvements in&#13;
services. With the primary intent to assist clients, studies will be undertaken to capture the response of representative consumer groups / sub-&#13;
groups on various service delivery issues and aspects of proposed interventions and use the information to develop a system to monitor&#13;
consumer behavior. The studies are designed to generate understanding of the baseline conditions regarding WSS service provision for&#13;
consumer groups, including coping strategies and costs, demand, and preferences for WSS services.&#13;
&#13;
The demand assessments will be carried out using survey approaches such as contingent valuation (stated preferences method) or revealed&#13;
preferences (direct and indirect market information). The inclusion of demand considerations in the design of policies will be an important first&#13;
step in breaking the existing vicious cycle of low revenues, high costs, low level of services and the increasing financial burden. The initial set&#13;
of two studies have been carried out in Delhi and Greater Bangalore. The next set of four studies includes Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, and&#13;
Hyderabad. In Delhi and Greater Bangalore the decision has already been taken to contract with the private sector to improve service delivery&#13;
under projects supported by World Bank, IFC, JBIC and others. The studies will support the establishment of baselines and design of reform&#13;
interventions, including the framework for assessing outcomes under performance-based contracts.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Reforming utilities and stakeholders recognize the need for baseline demand assessments and benefits of improved consumer information&#13;
     and monitoring&#13;
2.   Reforming utilities have the necessary technical, institutional and financial capacity to leverage improved consumer information in&#13;
     monitoring &amp; evaluation systems&#13;

Activity Description: WSP­ SA has initiated a study entitled "Water and Sanitation Services ­ its role in mitigating the impact of HIV / AIDS:&#13;
A Situation Analysis in India". The study seeks to identify the real situation of the HIV/ AIDS affected persons with regard to accessibility,&#13;
affordability and use of adequate water and sanitation services and hygienic practices. The purpose is to explore possibilities on how best the&#13;
water and sanitation sector can support the affected communities to access safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene education to mitigate the&#13;
impact of HIV / AIDS and to support community care for those affected and infected by HIV/AIDS. The intended output of the study is&#13;
generation of field data on the situation for better advocacy and to assist the concerned policy makers and service providers in planning and&#13;
implementing appropriate programs for supporting the cause of HIV/AIDS-affected persons. Based on the findings of the study it is proposed to&#13;
organize workshops to sensitize the service providers ( Govt. agencies and NGOs) on the need to mainstream water and sanitation in their care&#13;
and support program for PLHAs and also engage in advocacy for better service delivery by water and sanitation service providers.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1. At present water and sanitation is not getting due importance in the care and support program for People Living With HIV/AIDS.&#13;
2. There is greater need for advocacy with facts and figures on ground realities to mainstream the provision of water and sanitation and&#13;
     improve the services to address the special needs of this marginalized group.&#13;

Partners:                 SASEI, SASPR, SIDA&#13;
&#13;
Desired Activity Outcome: Suitable governance, management, and operational structures in partnership with the private sector developed for&#13;
the delivery of high quality piped drinking water services in the greater Bangalore area, by the Government of Karnataka.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Support development of PSP in Bangalore through support to Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Karnataka&#13;
Government, and Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation to put in place demand-responsive institutional&#13;
arrangements and policies to expand coverage of piped water supply and network sewerage to municipal areas around Bangalore, under the&#13;
innovative water distribution expansion project called the Greater Bangalore Water and Sanitation Project (GBWASP)&#13;
&#13;
This activity aims at providing the abovementioned support in three niche areas that have the potential of significantly influencing and&#13;
informing other government efforts towards PSP in UWSS in India. The first of the three areas is on the due diligence of the current regulatory&#13;
and legal provisions and the need for modifications to allow for PSP, in a scenario where there has been no significant PSP for water service&#13;
delivery in India as yet. The second is the technical and environmental due diligence on the design of the network to asses its suitability for&#13;
improving the quality of delivery of the water service by the private sector. The third line of assistance to the GoK and the project is through&#13;
training for community mobilization to develop a representative three tier community structure which would help create a feedback loop with&#13;
the users on the design and implementation of the project.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   The Greater Bangalore Water Supply project secures it capital funding.&#13;
2.   Private sector participation options presented by the financial advisor are accepted by GoK&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: July 04                                          End Date: Jun 06&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: States are supported in developing and starting suitable governance, management, and operational structures as&#13;
components of sector reform aimed at UWSS service delivery improvements.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Implementation support to urban authorities and WSS service providers who are undertaking a fundamental&#13;
transformation of service provision towards significant improvements in service levels ("24/7" water supply, low cost sewerage, etc.), injecting&#13;
private sector operational and management expertise, introducing better governance structures, and strengthening the role of civil society and&#13;
customers in decisions regarding service provision. Specific support will be provided to:&#13;
(a) Support reform strategies in Northeast cities: (especially in cities covered by AusAID project support in light of ongoing policy dialogue and&#13;
support to the AusAID Water and Sanitation Project). GoI had requested WSP-SA to support the state governments in undertaking an&#13;
assessment of the RWSS sector as part of the MoU process of the rural drinking water reform initiatives. WSP-SA is also finalizing a medium-&#13;
term partnership agreement with ASCI in Hyderabad that will include a component to support the establishment of a Change Management&#13;
Forum for the North East.&#13;
Meghalaya: A brief assessment of the state program concluded that WSP-SA could add value in regards to the development of a MoU (to be&#13;
signed with GoI based on an agreed reform plan for the rural drinking water sector). This would enable WSP-SA to stay in touch with&#13;
development in Shillong UWSS, in the event that the complexity of the relationship between the municipality and tribal authorities is resolved.&#13;
A first step will be to develop ­ in close consultation with the state government ­ the ToRs for the sector assessment study, based around (a) the&#13;
experience under the Sector Reform Project (SRP) (SRP is a community-led, demand-responsive approach to RWSS service provision initiated&#13;
by the Department of Drinking Water, Ministry of Rural Development in 26 States and 67 Districts), (b) clarifying the role of tribal authorities&#13;
in a decentralized service delivery environment, and (c) clarification of the position regarding the levels of access to safe WSS services.&#13;
&#13;
Sikkim: In Urban WSS, WSP-SA will assist in the institutional design of a robust municipality in Gangtok by supporting a workshop to discuss&#13;
the underlying principles of effective service delivery, disseminate global best practices in the design of municipal corporations and creating&#13;
positive incentives for service delivery enhancement through the intergovernmental system. This would also provide a forum for&#13;
debates/discussions on the functions and associated forms for service delivery in the context of Gangtok. In both cases these activities should&#13;
ultimately also link up to the establishment of a Change Management Forum for the North East.&#13;
&#13;
Initially an engagement strategy would be developed for engaging in the North East.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Demand-responsive reform implementation support - "SWAT" teams with appropriate technical and institutional reform skills will be set up&#13;
to respond rapidly to demand from reform-minded urban authorities to develop options for improving WSS services and for providing strategic&#13;
guidance during implementation of selected options. Technical work will include developing a step-by-step staged strategy for conversion of&#13;
water distribution systems from intermittent 24/7 continuous supply, an outline estimate of the costs associated with conversion to continuous&#13;
supply, and technical support to implement the strategy and monitor consumer attitudes once urban authorities are able to secure the necessary&#13;
funding. Options for scaling-up interventions on a sector wide basis would be explored. Andhra Pradesh is likely to be one of the states that may&#13;
be taken up under this activity, given the initial interest expressed by Andhra Pradesh Government.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Requests from other utility for support to development of reform strategies are secured&#13;
2.   The momentum for fiscal accountability is enhanced at the Central and State Government levels&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: July 04                                            End Date: Jun 07&#13;
&#13;
Note: The component related to the North-East under this sub-project is in the nature of on-demand cross-support to Aus-Aid. While the&#13;
business plan incorporates this activity, exact modalities, timelines etc. are to be determined.&#13;
&#13;
Indicators of outcome:&#13;
1.   Two states in the North East engage in the development of comprehensive sectoral transformation plans ­ FY06&#13;

Client:                    State governments, local bodies and service providers&#13;
Country:                   India&#13;
Partners:                  SASEI, ASCI, SIDA, Bank thematic group on Small Towns&#13;
&#13;
Desired Outcome: Government of Maharashtra (GoM) prepares and implements a statewide RWSS reform policy to improve accountability in&#13;
WSS service provision (including regulatory frameworks and restructuring of service providers).&#13;
&#13;
Description: The objective is to develop and undertake reforms in urban water (and sanitation?) sector so as to provide minimum standards of&#13;
services to urban residents, especially the poor and the vulnerable in urban habitations in the states. This requires an institutional environment&#13;
that is responsive to the demands of the citizens of the state for provisioning, operating and maintaining systems to ensure sustainable access to&#13;
water supply and sanitation services. The GoM has substantively restructured the RWSS sector placing responsibility with local governments to&#13;
deliver WSS services. Based on the success of this approach, the GoM is now seeking to apply similar principles to UWSS service provision. As&#13;
a part of the urban reforms, the GoM has decided to: a) restructure the State PHED viz. the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) into&#13;
functional and commercially oriented companies b) design and establish a regulatory framework for regulating the resource allocation, tariffs,&#13;
environmental issues and dispute resolution, and c) build the capacity of ULBs to own and manage service delivery. As a part of the reform&#13;
environment the GoM plans to develop rules of engagement with the ULBs and offer investment support based on performance benchmarks.&#13;
The end products of this engagement will be a) articulation of the State wide reform policy (b) regulatory framework and (c) restructured MJP.&#13;
WSP-SA will provide analytical and advisory support to state governments on the development of sectoral transformation plans. WSP-SA will&#13;
also develop guidelines and field notes that document the experiences in these critical areas.&#13;

Desired Outcome: Government of Goa (GoG) prepares and commences implementation of statewide RWSS reform policy to improve&#13;
accountability in WSS service provision (including regulatory frameworks and restructuring of service providers).&#13;
&#13;
Description: Following a hepatitis outbreak in Goa, the GoG approached the Department of Rural Drinking Water (RGNDWM) for assistance&#13;
in conducting an assessment of the quality of WSS service delivery in Goa with a view to developing systems for high quality, sustainable&#13;
service delivery in the sector. Following up on an assessment, the GoG is seeking assistance of WSP-SA in implementing a range of medium&#13;
term and long term reforms in the sector. In the medium term, the GoG is seeking WSP-SA assistance in (a) developing plans for 24x7 water&#13;
supply in 4 towns, (b) developing an incentivized `outcome focused' sanitation strategy &amp; program, and (c) establishing a benchmarking system&#13;
of continuous monitoring and improvement. In the longer term, the GoG has requested WSP-SA to assist in (1) developing communication&#13;
strategies on the need for comprehensive institutional reforms and (2) developing institutional restructuring options for the sector c/w regulatory&#13;
arrangements. WSP-SA will provide analytical and advisory support to the GoG in the development of these medium term plans with a view to&#13;
linking these reforms to the broader sectoral transformation agenda. On the basis of this experience, WSP-SA will develop guidelines and field&#13;
notes that document the experiences in these critical areas.&#13;

Task Manager:            Mark Ellery&#13;
Client:                  Government of Goa&#13;
Country:                 India&#13;
Partners:                DFID&#13;
&#13;
Desired Outcome: The Government of Goa develops and expands its partnerships with the private sector and civil society organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WSP-SA is supporting the Government of Goa in an undertaking to convert 4 towns from an intermittent water supply to&#13;
a `24/7' continuously pressurized system. As no city in India has continuously pressurized water supply, there is a need to bring in international&#13;
expertise to manage this conversion. Initial scoping for this contract has identified either a Management Contract or a `Non-Equity' Alliance&#13;
Contract as the preferred form of contracting. Given that Goa is a small state that does not have the economies of scale associated with other&#13;
similar undertakings in India (Delhi, Karnataka), and given the technical capability of the Public Works Department (PWD) in Goa is relatively&#13;
strong, a conventional 'Management Contract' appears to be a relatively expensive option (in terms of both cost and time). It therefore appears as&#13;
though an alliance O&amp;M contract may be the preferred form of contracting for conversion of 4 towns to `24/7'. As this form of contracting has&#13;
not been undertaken before in India, there is a need to (a) `sell' the notion of alliance contracting (as potentially the preferred form of PPP in&#13;
Goa) for the O&amp;M of the distribution zones, and (b) develop the knowledge in India of `best practice' in the bidding, establishment and&#13;
management of Alliance Contracts.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA is also supporting the government of Goa in strengthening a government run consumer help-line into a consumer redressal system that&#13;
is implemented through a partnership contract with a local civil society organization. Similarly, WSP-SA is also supporting the Government of&#13;
Goa to enter into a contract with another CSO for running the implementation of a series of workshops that are designed to engage civil society&#13;
in water supply and sanitation issues. These partnering arrangements with CSO's shall seek to provide a platform for deepening the PWD's&#13;
engagement with civil society in developing appropriate higher level regulatory frameworks.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Given the political unstability in Goa, the sustained commitment to expanded partnerships of the public sector with the non-public sector&#13;
     will need to remain politically acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: Jul 05                                             End Date: Jun 07&#13;
&#13;
Indicators of outcome:&#13;
1.   The PWD has implemented a PPP contract that is working towards the delivery of `24/7' in 4 towns in Goa - Jun 07.&#13;
2.   The PWD has entered into partnership PPP's with CSOs for the provision of consumer redressal services and facilitation of broader civil&#13;
     society engagement.&#13;

Client:                   GoH and local bodies&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: Government of Haryana adopts and begins implementing a statewide UWSS reform policy (including regulatory&#13;
frameworks and restructuring of service providers).&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: GoH intends to pursue reforms in the UWSS sector. The impetus for reform is driven primarily by the general&#13;
underperformance of WSS service delivery in the state. WSS services across the state are provided through a single state agency, the Public&#13;
Health Engineering Department (PHED). There are 68 towns, ranging in size from mixed rural-urban small towns of less than twenty thousand&#13;
people to larger urban centers with several hundred thousand inhabitants. Under the current institutional arrangements, PHED makes no&#13;
distinction between the two in terms of service delivery. GoH has also committed to increase access to sanitation facilities through network&#13;
sewerage systems. The problems in the WSS sector across urban and rural contexts in Haryana are common, though require differential reform&#13;
options. The satellite municipalities of Fairadabad and Gurgaon face significantly different challenges from the state as a whole, in terms of the&#13;
degree of urbanization, characteristics of population density and their respective city sizes. In approaching water and sanitation from a sectoral&#13;
perspective there is an opportunity to develop institutional reform options for the WSS sector in Haryana that are responsive to the different&#13;
constraints (yet embedded relationships) of these entities. It is in this context, that the GoH is seeking to assess a range of institutional service&#13;
delivery options within a common statewide policy/regulatory framework. WSP-SA will provide analytical and advisory support to GoH in the&#13;
assessment of current sector status and development of reform options. The first step in this process is a study to understand the current position&#13;
of the sector, and the challenges of such a transformation. Following from this, develop a framework of institutional options that will define the&#13;
reform of the sector as a whole. The development of institutional reform options would be supported by the World Bank Town WSS Initiative&#13;
Institutional/financial Advisors for sharing generic institutional reform options, specific international experience in other countries on the reform&#13;
process and the various options, commenting on the pros and cons of the identified options. The key output from this program of assistance will&#13;
be the development and testing of a range of institutional reform options for particular environs, which can co-exist within a common state level&#13;
framework.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   UWSS utility reform remains an important priority for the state political leadership&#13;
2.   Adequate political will is generated for GoH to embark upon a reform path&#13;

Client:                Govt. of Gujarat (GoG)&#13;

Partners:              PPIAF, IFC, DFID&#13;
&#13;
Desired Outcome: GoG adopts statewide framework for promoting PPPs in the state, takes steps towards associated capacity building at the&#13;
State and transactions level for undertaking PPPs and prepares and implements at least one PPP transaction.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: GoG is contemplating wide ranging reforms in the UWSS sector with the objective of providing improved WSS services&#13;
across the state in an equitable and sustainable manner. One of the key elements of this reform is exploring efficient institutional mechanisms&#13;
for effective delivery of WSS services. In line with this, GoG is thinking of an increased role of private sector in investment, operations,&#13;
maintenance and management of WSS assets through collaborative and productive PPPs. GoG and its agencies have had discussions with WSP-&#13;
SA over the last few years regarding assistance in developing a proposed PPP for a water transmission and distribution project intended to serve&#13;
the urban areas on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. In line with the emerging policy and reform direction, GoG has now requested WSP-SA for&#13;
broad based assistance on both the policy and transaction fronts in exploring and promoting PPPs in the WSS sector across the state. This&#13;
envisages the following three key areas of support:&#13;
1.   Assistance to GoG in establishing a state-wide framework for promoting PPPs in the state: This involves documentation and&#13;
     highlighting of best practices in PPP frameworks worldwide and assisting the state to design and put in place its own PPP framework&#13;
     including:&#13;
       a.   Enablers for PPPs and removing existing policy &amp; procedural bottlenecks&#13;
       b.   Guidelines for the entire project development process: inception, selection, testing, structuring, procurement and delivery of such&#13;
            projects&#13;
       c.   Incentive framework to attract local bodies to adopt PPP models for delivery of WSS Services&#13;
2.   Associated capacity building at the state and transaction level for undertaking PPPs: Supporting GoG in building govt's capacity to&#13;
     evaluate, negotiate, implement and monitor PPP projects including:&#13;
       a. Providing technical, environmental and regulatory institution capacity building and training through strengthening existing institutions&#13;
          or creation of new institutions (such as a PPP Development Unit).&#13;
       b.   Mechanisms for assisting local bodies to adapt PPP models to their specific needs.&#13;
3.   Assistance to GoG in project preparation through information assessments to develop a baseline for some of the key PPP transactions and&#13;
     working with partners (such as IFC) for taking forward the process.&#13;
&#13;
The key outputs of this assignment will be a series of recommendations on the state level framework for promoting PPPs and state level capacity&#13;
building, and helping GoG in select transactions that have a demonstration value across the state. Beyond standard PPP mechanisms, specific&#13;
attention will be paid to arrangements that are suited to the local context and best utilize local private service providers and individual&#13;
management talents. Outcomes of this exercise could be replicated in other cities/towns in Gujarat and elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   UWSS reform remain an important priority for GoG&#13;
2.   PPPs remains an important element of of UWSS reforms&#13;
3.   Supportive political consensus emerges around policy, operational and regulatory transitions&#13;

&#13;
Desired Activity Outcome: To prepare, and disseminate the findings from a pilot strategic communications campaign for urban reform in&#13;
India to help build consensus through two-way communication, public polling and stakeholder consultations.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Governments around the world are increasingly recognizing the need to understand and engage stakeholders in the&#13;
process of public sector reform to build support for change and to ensure long-term sustainability. Effective communications are especially&#13;
important in the water and sanitation sector, which is subject to particularly intense scrutiny due to its social, political and economic importance.&#13;
Strategic communication can be an effective management tool to initiate and sustain a dialogue on the necessary reforms among a spectrum of&#13;
stakeholders. In addition to its socio-political risk mitigation role, strategic communication has proven to be an effective tool to design and&#13;
implement programs in a transparent and participatory manner.&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this project is to provide reforming State governments in India with a road map for future communications and consultations&#13;
with stakeholders. Terms of references will be designed to provide overall direction to the respective State government for moving ahead in the&#13;
communications process, as well as a basis for engaging specialized communications experts to develop and implement a comprehensive and&#13;
customized strategy.&#13;
&#13;
At the end of two years, it is hoped that the outcomes of these pilots will feed into a broader all-India communications strategy to create a&#13;
demand for reform (at the municipal level) and a demand for the services (from consumers).&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Current interest/ initiatives on recognizing importance of communications in UWSS are continued&#13;
2.   Support/ investments for communication-linked activities is continuing&#13;
3.   Stable political environment in the country&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: National, state and local governments adopt strategies and support implementation of innovative approaches to improve&#13;
sanitary environment in urban areas with adequate access and disposal arrangements at a city-wide level.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: A little over a fourth of India's 53 million urban households do not have sanitation facilities within their premises. The&#13;
urban slum communities have limited or no access to any sanitation services. Inadequate access to sanitation is one of the key impediments to&#13;
improving the quality of life and productivity of urban areas. In addition to poor access to sanitation facilities in slum communities, the overall&#13;
sanitation situation at the city level is equally questionable. Understanding that only 30% of urban local bodies are connected to sewerage&#13;
network system , the majority of the urban population rely on on-site sanitation arrangements which ranges from septic tanks to water seal pit&#13;
latrines. In general most of the urban local bodies [have phased out from service latrines and have upgraded to water borne latrines. Although&#13;
70% of households with access to sanitation are relying on on-site sanitation facilities. There is little information on the management of&#13;
sanitation assets and reliability of safe disposal arrangements. Knowledge generation and information dissemination become an integral part of&#13;
engagement in the urban sanitation agenda.&#13;
&#13;
Support Policy Framework: The sanitation problem is mostly one of policymakers adopting a "supply driven" approach to service delivery&#13;
with little emphasis on "creating real demand' for meeting sanitary outcomes. One of the reasons for this dismal scenario is that urban sanitation&#13;
has not been adequately brought on to the national agenda of the urban sector. However, it is necessary to increase the profile of the urban&#13;
sanitation sector by bringing it on top of the policy agenda. With this objective it is envisaged to support the national level task force to provide&#13;
guidance in framing policies on urban sanitation based on reviews of existing programs and advocate new approaches and practices through&#13;
continuous dialogue, exchanges and networks. To support the policy framework process, an upstream work on strategic planning on urban&#13;
sanitation is required that addresses the constituent elements of policy and planning principles and issues related to institutions, cost recovery&#13;
and sustainability of sanitation services. Therefore, to build up the momentum it is essential to work with one or two state governments to create&#13;
demand for sanitation services and develop a state level policy framework to enable cities within the state to implement innovative and&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
Sector Transformation: Strategic engagement with state governments to develop state level sanitation framework to enable urban local bodies&#13;
to outline strategic plans for meeting sanitary outcomes would constitute a key area of the work program. It is envisaged that ULBs will also&#13;
have better understanding of the mechanism of engaging the poor to provide access to sanitation while developing city level action plans.&#13;
Through the process of learning and knowledge sharing, it is anticipated that few cities will explore new ways of doing business better.&#13;
&#13;
Operational Support: Developing advocacy/research materials and demonstration through pilots will support national and state level policies&#13;
and sector transformation. A framework to monitor outcomes and to measure performance will be initiated with key emphasis on developing&#13;
simple and verifiable monitoring indicator to bring in institutional accountability.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   The national government will make policy initiation for improved city­wide sanitation&#13;
2.   The state governments commits to initiate a sanitation reform plan&#13;
3.   Cities agree to develop action plans&#13;

Desired Outcome: Greater clarity in adoption and implementation of the demand-responsive RWSS reform initiatives announced by GoI.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: This project aims to assist in taking forward the GoI's efforts to develop appropriate incentives and disincentives to&#13;
leverage state governments to adopt systems of RWSS service delivery that are financially, environmentally, and socially sustainable. GoI has&#13;
announced `MoU' guidelines with incentives for states to develop sector-wide transformation plans devolving the responsibility for RWSS&#13;
service provision to local governments. This project aims to support this process with policy advice that draws on the WSP's networks and&#13;
experiences in implementation support at the state level.&#13;
&#13;
To scale up reform projects requires clarifying the position with regards to 100% O&amp;M cost recovery from users in the context of the devolving&#13;
of responsibility for service delivery to the PRIs, the issue of the safety nets for the poor and mechanisms for dealing with multi-village&#13;
schemes, approaches to the transfer of assets and staff to the PRIs, the means of financing the transformation of the sector and the modes of&#13;
dealing with existing capital expenditure transfers. On the sanitation side, there is also a need for strengthening the systems for evaluation of the&#13;
outcome incentive scheme, Nirmal Gram Puraskar.&#13;
&#13;
Other tasks in this project include the engagement of a `call-down' service to support the GoI in regulating the performance of States in&#13;
designing sector transformation plans. This includes a strategic umbrella component that is designed to draw out key qualitative and quantitative&#13;
aspects that apply to the sector ­ at large.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Consistent political will towards the MOU principles (in particular the focus on the strengthening of local government agency in service&#13;
delivery).&#13;
2.   A commitment to long term sustainability (even at the cost of short term gains in expanding capital investment)&#13;
3.   Sustained commitment and growing technical capacity within RGNDWM.&#13;
&#13;

Desired Outcome: A deepening and broadening of public and non-public partnerships for RWSS in India.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: In response to a request from the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission, WSP-SA is seeking to prepare a&#13;
framework to support state and local governments in designing and implementing PPP's in rural India. Specifically, this project shall seek to&#13;
develop incremental means of expanding public and non-public interactions to include (a) the informal unregulated private sector, (b) more&#13;
complex forms of public-private partnerships (PPP's) and (c) the application of more rigorous frameworks to government and NGO/user group&#13;
relations.&#13;
&#13;
The objective of this project is to develop a RWSS specific framework that will deliver the following:&#13;
1.   A more robust `risk assessment' framework for analyzing the relations between state / local government and user groups/NGO's. This will&#13;
     be designed to assist state governments to structure improved relationships between local governments and user groups.&#13;
2.   Support to state governments in determining the structure of public-private interactions in RWSS. This should develop simple mechanisms&#13;
     for deepening and broadening existing PPP's in RWSS c/w templates of standard deeper PPP contracting options.&#13;
3.   Develop a simple form of contractual relationship that is applicable to both the local private sector and user groups, following a&#13;
     `partnership' or `alliance' type contractual arrangement.&#13;
&#13;
On the basis of the above, WSP-SA shall support states in the development of more rigorous contract arrangements for transferring risk and&#13;
management responsibility to community based organizations. WSP-SA shall also work with states to open up the opportunities to move from&#13;
community based to PPP style service provision arrangements. WSP-SA shall support states in deepening and broadening the role of SMPP's in&#13;
RWSS. This shall include the deepening of NGO interactions into more formal PPP's, shifting contracts for services into deeper forms of service&#13;
contracts, supporting suppliers of hardware to move towards the supply of services etc.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Consistent political will at GoI level to continue to support this move towards an expanded role for the private sector.&#13;
2.   The `buy-in' from various states in the research phase translates into a willingness on behalf of those states to test some of the      various&#13;
options identified.&#13;

Desired Outcome: State governments develop contextual time-bound transformation plans to institutionalize reforms within the RWSS sector.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: This project supports various state governments to develop appropriate policies and plans to ensure the long term&#13;
sustainability (social, environmental, technical) of the RWSS sector, through the development of sector transformation plans that move away&#13;
from centralized, supply led approaches towards systems that embed decentralized, demand-responsive approaches in service delivery.&#13;
Although the GoI has developed a series of incentives (linked to the MoU) to promote this process, the onus still lies with the states to develop&#13;
an agenda of reforms appropriate to their particular circumstances. In recognition of the difficulty of this endeavor, the GoI has requested WSP-&#13;
SA to provide policy support to numerous states in pursuit of this agenda.&#13;
&#13;
Under the GoI program, WSP-SA is supporting a range of states in the undertaking of sector assessment studies to highlight the need for the&#13;
transformation of the existing sector towards a more sustainable approach to RWSS (Maharashtra, A.P., Kerala, H.P, Haryana, Goa). WSP-SA&#13;
has also engaged in advocacy with new states, which should eventually lead to these states accessing WSP-SA support to prepare plans to&#13;
reform their RWSS sector (Sikkim, Meghalaya). Finally, WSP-SA is also seeking to leverage other donors (GTZ, DANIDA, UNICEF, SASEI)&#13;
support to various other states (Karnataka, HP, Uttaranchal, Punjab) in line with this GoI process. The development of sector transformation&#13;
plans for the sector would require a process of assistance to states to:&#13;
·    Advocate for sectoral transformation, as highlighted in the State Sector Assessment Reports,&#13;
·    Develop a State Vision Statement that defines the alignment of the reform agenda for the RWSS sector,&#13;
·    Develop a Comprehensive State Policy for the Rural Drinking Water and Sanitation Sector that details the financial, institutional,&#13;
     legislative, and resourcing arrangements,&#13;
·    Develop an Annual Action Plan which spells out the timing for the implementation of the reforms, and&#13;
·    Develop an Agreed Action Framework on the basis of this annual action plan &amp; in consultation with RGNDWM, which will form the&#13;
     basis for the future implementation of RWSS within the state and all future releases of RWSS funding.&#13;
&#13;
This support to states in the development of sectoral transformation plans critically includes aspects such as sanitation, M&amp;E, WQM and WRM.&#13;
Given the poor sanitary situation and WSP-SA's influential position on outcome oriented approaches to sanitation in sanitation, WSP-SA will&#13;
also seek to raise the profile of sanitation through identification of the opportunities that are embedded in the central incentives for&#13;
decentralized, community driven sanitation. In this context, states would be assisted to adopt a reform based sanitation policy as a matter of&#13;
priority.&#13;
&#13;
Given WSP-SA's limited human resource capacity, WSP-SA shall also seek to identify and develop partnerships with capable government /&#13;
civil society organizations, in order to leverage greater support to states in designing and implementing these transformation plans.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   That the states which WSP-SA is supporting are convinced of the benefits of these reform programs.&#13;
2.   That WSP-SA can leverage other donors to assist states in developing sector transformation plans.&#13;
3.   That the vagaries of the various state-led reform programs (i.e. for tribal authorities, urban biases, water resource management&#13;
     requirements) will be acceptable to the GoI.&#13;

Project Update: 07/04 These project activities were part EWDSA/IN/18, EWDSA/IN/19, and EWDSA/IN/20: all three projects re-aligned in&#13;
FY05. 07/05 A crucial shift from FY05 to FY06 in this project, is that WSP-SA is seeking to leverage other institutions&#13;
(NGO/Donor/UN/Gov't/networks/training institutes) to support states in the design of sector transformation plans. In recognition that the&#13;
quantum of work in each state is enormous, leveraging other agencies is crucial to the broadening the impact of this process. In FY06, the&#13;
project 31/SA/IN (which was created for undertaking sectoral studies) has been deleted and combined with this design of transformation plans,&#13;
in order to give recognition to the larger context within which these studies are being undertaken. Greater emphasis is also planned in FY06 on&#13;
developing communication strategies around the sector assessment studies, as a means of gaining momentum for comprehensive reforms.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: State governments design and implement institutional reforms designed to improve accountability of RWSS service&#13;
delivery&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Many states in India have considerable experience in implementing reform pilots in water and sanitation, however the&#13;
challenge facing the RWSS sector is that of embedding this learning within the existing RWSS service delivery systems. The aim of this project&#13;
therefore seeks to assist partner governments to design, develop and implement institutional reform programs in specific sub-sectors of RWSS.&#13;
This may occur as either (a) the implementation of priority aspects of the states sector transformation plans in progressive states, or (b) the entry&#13;
point into the larger debates on institutional reform in RWSS.&#13;

In order to undertake this, WSP-SA will seek to build up sub-sectoral expertise through supporting partner state governments in developing&#13;
`systems approaches' to address critical issues of concern in the RWSS service delivery sector. This will require WSP-SA to work with states to&#13;
develop high quality institutional approaches to address critical sub-sectoral issues such as sanitation, water quality monitoring, M&amp;E, M/V&#13;
schemes, inclusion, regulation, drought relief, etc.       Generally this support will be undertaken in 2 phases. The first phase will involve&#13;
implementation support for the development of the strategy and the details necessary for piloting a `systems approach' to the particular sub-&#13;
sector. The second phase will involve implementation support and capacity building for `scaling-up' of the sub-sectoral approach across the&#13;
state.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA shall also seek to develop appropriate entry points to raise the issue of the restructuring of the existing water utilities, in line with the&#13;
73rd and 74th constitutional amendments. In so doing, WSP-SA is aware that there is a critical need to continue to focus on improved service&#13;
delivery performance. Given the high cost to state governments in undertaking this process (both financially &amp; politically) ensuring the link to&#13;
improved service delivery performance is critical to success in the restructuring of service providers. This project shall seek to develop `best&#13;
practices' that equip state governments with both the tools and the willingness to plan and implement restructuring activities that are responsive&#13;
to the interests of the various stakeholders and the political economy of change in the various contexts.&#13;
&#13;
Given that RWSS reforms seek to build greater accountability of service providers to the users of water supply and sanitation services, this&#13;
project shall retain an explicit focus on the mechanisms of `voice' and `client power' whereby clients can discipline and hold service providers&#13;
accountable for the quality of RWSS services. WSP-SA shall therefore seek to develop systems that enable consumers to raise their voice or&#13;
exercise their choice in service delivery ­ and importantly in the `advocacy for' and `choice of' reform approaches to RWSS service delivery. In&#13;
this context, strengthening `downward accountability' encompasses both service provision and the choice of the preferred means of service&#13;
provision.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   States will seek to translate elements of the transformation plans developed for the RWSS sector (EWDSA/IN/29) into action.&#13;
2.   Alternatively, the entry into states through various sub-sectoral programs can either (a) drive a larger reform agenda, and/or (b) inform&#13;
     other states of reformed `systems approaches' to improved RWSS service delivery.&#13;
3.   States will be willing to undertake the communication processes necessary to drive the various reform plans.&#13;

Project Update: : 07/04 These project activities were part EWDSA/IN/18, EWDSA/IN/19, and EWDSA/IN/20: all three projects re-aligned in&#13;
FY05. 07/05 In FY06, this project has been conceived of slightly differently from FY05, to recognize the need for a single `implementation&#13;
style' project that either (a) implements a state sector transformation plan, or (b) provides specific `need based' entry point into a broader reform&#13;
agenda. Whilst starting from very different perspectives, `on the ground' the work of WSP in these two areas is very similar. This is because,&#13;
ultimately, a sector transformation plan is always implemented in the various sub-sectors based on the `need of the hour' and cannot possibly be&#13;
implemented across the whole sector in one go. Similarly, where states have a crisis in a particular aspect of RWSS service delivery, WSP-SA&#13;
seeks to respond to this through a systems approach that highlights the broader accountability issues within the sector.&#13;

Desired Outcome: National, state, and local agencies develop sufficient capacity to handle simple but effective M&amp;E practices for the entire&#13;
sector through enhanced management, accountability and documentation potential of major national programs.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Prevailing M&amp;E practices in Indian RWSS primarily relate to state-level conventional monitoring of RWSS projects and&#13;
isolated initiatives of participatory M&amp;E. The objective of this project is to speed up the trend by spreading throughout India the M&amp;E&#13;
approach, methods, and tools standing at the cutting edge and proposing sound analytical framework to impact evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
a) National M&amp;E system for the GoI reform programs in RWSS: The M&amp;E system as defined from these 2 modules is primarily looking at&#13;
inputs, activities, and outputs. It is similar to a project-based M&amp;E, except that it is covering a national program and focuses on tracking&#13;
processes translating whether institutional reforms are taking root in implementation. The specificities of the M&amp;E system are rooted in the fact&#13;
that the M&amp;E has to appraise a reform-oriented program at a national scale.&#13;
&#13;
b) Moving towards an Integrated M&amp;E system cutting across programs and sectoral themes: The National M&amp;E system was conceived to&#13;
serve as a M&amp;E platform for the entire sub-sector in the future. Accordingly, provisions were made for the system to cover 3 other themes:&#13;
water quality monitoring, water conservation measures and hygiene and health. Also, because of the articulation of the program dataset with&#13;
secondary dataset available from the last National survey, the National M&amp;E system has to potential to go beyond traditional spatially and&#13;
temporal boundaries associated with programs delineation.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA has been requested to assess the feasibility for the M&amp;E system to cover also the regular type of water supply programs with a view to&#13;
arrive at a more systematic update of the sectoral database. And, there is today a broad agreement that arriving at a fully integrated M&amp;E system&#13;
(across programs and themes) operational across the entire country for 2007 would be a most desirable goal. Achieving the same would imply&#13;
that GoI could rely on extended partnerships and a steering committee may be formed to accompany this process over the next 2 years.&#13;
WSP-SA will contribute to the further development of the M&amp;E design and technical assistance to GoI in planning and supporting the roll out of&#13;
the M&amp;E system across the entire country.&#13;

Project Update: 7/04 These activities were earlier part of EWDSA/IN/18 and 20. Project 7/05. Study on behavior change, which was included&#13;
in this project in FY05 is now spun off as a sub-project (EWDSA/IN/32 (a)). In FY06 this project is responding to a request from the&#13;
RGNDWM to develop a `scale-up' strategy to expand the M&amp;E horizontally to encompass non-reform programs (i.e., a dynamic system for&#13;
updating habitation coverage status) and begin to expand the M&amp;E functionally to develop pilot modules for other components (i.e., health,&#13;
water quality, water resources).&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: Increased knowledge among policy makers and sector professionals on the effects of health and behavior change with&#13;
improved sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in Maharashtra seeks to improve health and the quality of life in villages by&#13;
improving sanitation. The purpose of this study is to undertake a rigorous evaluation of the campaign in terms of its effect on the health with&#13;
changed behavior and hygienic practices. The study is being conducted in the districts of Ahmednagar, Nanded and Nandurbar.It measures the&#13;
outcomes in both project and "control" (i.e., comparison) villages, both before and after the intervention. The specific hypotheses to be tested&#13;
are: 1) the project design ­ the provision of information and technical support alone, without financial subsidy ­ leads to improved hygienic&#13;
behavior such as less open defecation, more hand washing after defecation and other kinds of behavior leading to better hygiene. 2) the greater&#13;
the reduction of open defecation and hygienic behavior, the better the health of children as measured by fewer episodes of diarrhea and greater&#13;
gains in weight and height.&#13;
&#13;
The randomized evaluation will analyze whether, and how, the campaign worked. First, knowing whether a program yields results is important&#13;
for any decision concerning its continuation or expansion. Clear demonstration of effectiveness can also be used to build support for the&#13;
program. Second, the project has shown great promise but what if it does not work? Proper evaluation can identify why this might happen and&#13;
what adjustments can be made to correct it. The study analyzes where in the chain of events, between approaching a village, changing its&#13;
sanitation habits, improving the safety of its food and water and having healthier children might it break down. Identifying where problems arise&#13;
can trigger corrective action and improve the project's success. Third, if small scale projects are to make an important contribution to&#13;
government policy, they need to be expanded or "scaled up". It is important to know what aspects of the program lead to greater or less success&#13;
and how robust are the results.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
That the villages designed as `program' and `control' retain the status throughout the study period As the control villages may be intervened&#13;
organically due to widespread communication on sanitation.&#13;

&#13;
Desired Outcome: A consolidated systems approach to water quality monitoring &amp; surveillance is developed from the various `crisis'&#13;
responses at the state-level and accepted by GoI.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: WSP-SA is developing an information base on various water quality issues across India (arsenic pollution, microbial&#13;
contamination and fluoride pollution) based on various approaches (willingness to pay studies, ground water surveillance and sampling/response&#13;
systems). Most of these interventions have been undertaken as a response to a specific crisis, but more importantly all of these cases `tell a story'&#13;
of a failure of any comprehensive water quality management system that routinely identifies and responds to water quality issues, irrespective of&#13;
the particular form of pollution/contamination. This project seek to build a knowledge base on a few case studies in selected states across India&#13;
facing specific water quality issues, sufficient enough to a) generate a critical mass of water quality-related interventions to bring the topic in the&#13;
public debate with a sound information base, b) draw some general findings, common to different states and type of pollution, and c) start&#13;
identifying driving principles for a systems approach to the issue. WSP-SA will examine four components in four states: (a) Strategy on&#13;
fluoride mitigation in Maharashtra; (b) Study on bacteriological contamination in Kerala; (c) WTP study on Arsenic mitigation in West Bengal;&#13;
(d) Water Quality &amp; Water Resources&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Overall environment for inter-department collaboration on cross-sectoral issues relatively favorable&#13;
2.   Capacity of Government to proceed administrative actions without delay and for taking the lead in implementation stage&#13;
3.   National Hydrology Project enables the linking of WQ and WRM and credible partner identified to enter the WRM domain&#13;

Indicators of outcome:&#13;
1.   Pilot states adopt and begin implementing a state-wide drinking water quality management framework ­ Dec 05&#13;
2.   GoI adopts findings of studies as the basis of policies to remediate water quality ­ Jun 06&#13;
&#13;
Project Milestones:&#13;
1.   Lessons from pilots in 3 districts across Maharashtra inform GoM's policy revisions ­ Aug 05&#13;
2.   GoK adopts survey results to form basis of remediation strategy ­ May 06&#13;
3.   GoWB utilizes findings to inform the design of a water quality monitoring and response strategy ­ Jun 06&#13;
Project Update: 7/04 These water quality project activities were earlier part of EWDSA/IN/19 7/05 End date extended by 1 year. In FY06, the&#13;
alignment of this project is to continue to develop the various `crisis' response interventions at the state level, but with a clear intention to&#13;
consolidate this into a consistent `risk management' systems approach to water quality monitoring and remedial measures.&#13;

Desired Outcome: Universal and sustainable access to improved WSS services through decentralization reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: For all sections of the society, and especially for women, WSS is a critical service with a direct impact on their welfare,&#13;
health and productivity. Stakeholders in Pakistan are still slow in making a comprehensive and complete shift from supply-led approaches of&#13;
asset creation to that of decentralized asset management, despite the opportunity provided by decentralization reforms. This activity will assist&#13;
the GoP, to articulate and refine aspects of decentralization policy that provide incentives for WSS sector reforms and service delivery&#13;
improvements at local level, while also developing knowledge management mechanisms to manage the risks of decentralization and facilitating&#13;
processes to broaden consensus on the nature and trajectory of reforms. It will help scaling up capacity enhancement strategies piloted in DI&#13;
Khan across the NWFP and Pakistan more broadly, via support to IFI lending programs. The project will undertake the following broad&#13;
activities: (a) Strengthening policy frameworks for improved water supply &amp; sanitation, (b) Knowledge management to support&#13;
decentralization in the W&amp;S Sector, (c) Support LGs, UNICEF and others on water quality initiatives (Arsenic, Fluoride, etc), (d) Building&#13;
consensus on reform strategies with External Support Agencies (ESAs).&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Continued progress by federal, provincial and local governments towards decentralization and sector reforms.&#13;
2.   Current policy initiatives on decentralization are politically supported and continued.&#13;
3.   Willingness of GoP to prioritize water supply and sanitation and institutionalize SACOSAN.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Improved delivery of decentralized WSS services through strengthened capacity of TMAs and SMEs.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: All four provincial governments have promulgated the model local government ordinance in 2001. Relatively short&#13;
implementation period and conflicting perspectives, regarding the design of decentralization process have contributed to a protracted period of&#13;
transition. WSP-SA's work, during the design and initial transition phase, was instrumental in guiding government policy. Over the past two&#13;
years, WSP-SA has primarily supported the federal government through technical assistance on the design of fiscal instruments to incentivize&#13;
performance, while piloting appropriate approaches to building local capacity in selected municipalities. In this project WSP-SA will continue to&#13;
support local level reform efforts that address the capacity deficit of local governments and develop/create an enabling environment for SMEs in&#13;
the WSS sector. Two major activities are envisaged under this project: (a) Capacity Building of TMAs, (b) Create an Enabling Environment&#13;
for Small and Medium Enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Systems and procedures in place for local governments and TMAs to explore innovative solutions.&#13;
2.   Willingness and capacity of small scale private sector to venture into the WSS sector.&#13;
3.   Availability of donor funding to support scaled-up sector reform efforts.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Service providers and elected representatives accountable to consumers and citizens for enhanced WSS service&#13;
delivery.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Decentralization reforms in Pakistan are intended to strengthen the accountability relationship between government and&#13;
citizens, thereby creating incentives for the sustained provision of high quality and universal basic services. Preliminary findings on transition to&#13;
decentralized governance systems is that this linkage is largely determined by the political nature and maturity of a particular district/tehsil and&#13;
the provincial and national leanings of the local ruling elite. However, existing advocacy organizations typically focus more on civil and&#13;
criminal rights then socio-economic rights and the need to strengthen accountable and responsive service delivery systems. Citizen voice and&#13;
client power remain typically weak in relation to local service delivery systems. This project will initiate learning and dialogue to strengthen&#13;
voice and client power in local service delivery processes through the following activities: (a) Strengthening Mechanisms for Citizens Voice and&#13;
Client Power, (b) Creating greater awareness on Sector Issues within the Media and National and Provincial Representatives on W&amp;S and&#13;
poverty, (c) initiating activities to support large city water supply authorities, specifically selected cities in Punjab, in the design and&#13;
implementation of reforms to enhance political and operational accountability.&#13;

Client:              Federal Ministry of Environment, Provincial Local Government and Housing &amp; Urban Departments, Various LGs&#13;
Country:             Pakistan&#13;
Partners:            World Bank/DfID/UNICEF&#13;
&#13;
Desired Outcome: Policy makers/utilities promote/adopt key monitoring and evaluation tools to improve service provision, especially for the&#13;
poor and marginalized customers.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Description: Baseline information on the performance of urban water supply and sanitation (UWSS) agencies is a key mechanism to&#13;
identify performance improvement initiatives and measure their impact. However, existing information on the performance of UWSS sector in&#13;
Pakistan is largely anecdotal, not available regularly and seldom comparable across cities or internationally. A comprehensive assessment of&#13;
performance of UWSS utilities has never been undertaken for inter-utility comparisons. Thus good practices and areas with potential room for&#13;
improvement are yet to be identified and shared with others for the benefit of the sector. This information is critical for the evolution of&#13;
government policy measures, for private sector lenders and for development partners to target their assistance appropriately. This activity is part&#13;
of a larger project supporting UWSS reforms in the Punjab province of Pakistan. WSP-SA will work with the World Bank and IFC to support&#13;
five Water and Sanitation Authorities (WASAs) in Punjab province to initiate a benchmarking exercise to support performance improvement&#13;
programs. This project, in addition to being part of an activity in the province, is also a part of a regional level project that aims to encourage and&#13;
institutionalize performance benchmarking practices from a cross section of UWSS providers in South Asia. The initiative is not aimed at&#13;
extracting performance data on a one-off basis, but rather to support utilities to develop and sustain rigorous and regular performance&#13;
benchmarking practices that allow them to identify appropriate performance improvement initiatives and measure their impact. The project&#13;
concept has three phases: (i) Introduction, Preparations, Planning ­ The evolution phase, (ii) Data collection, review and analyses ­ The scale-up&#13;
phase, (iii) Roll-out program ­ institutionalization phase.&#13;
&#13;
The exercise will also include ways to measure, monitor and benchmark WSS services for all forms of service provision whether formal or&#13;
informal. Appropriate indicators will be developed for evaluating the extent of involvement by small scale independent providers/domestic&#13;
private sector in the five cities. These will include measures to capture the monthly amount paid by poorer households for WSS, including for&#13;
services obtained from small scale service providers, and the extent to which the utility is contracting out or otherwise partnering with the local&#13;
private sector and NGOs.&#13;

Client:                   City District Government Karachi, KWSB, Government of Sindh, PPIAF, Cities Alliance, JICA, ADB&#13;
Country:                  Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome:          City authorities prepare and commence implementation of UWSS reform policy framework to improve&#13;
accountability in service provision (including regulatory frameworks and restructuring of service providers), though institutional reforms and&#13;
enhanced accountability to consumers.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: KWSB, GoS, CDGK have committed to undertaking institutional reforms to improve access to and quality of WSS in&#13;
Karachi. Service delivery levels are currently poor, which imposes serious economic and social costs. Data are too weak to adequately support&#13;
planning and service delivery. KWSB lacks accountability, specifically to consumers, and any effective autonomy to meet its mandate. These&#13;
problems are compounded by inappropriate HR management practices. There is consensus that reforms to WSS in Karachi must address&#13;
outstanding issues of political and operational accountability in the delivery of WSS services. This commitment, which is shared by the&#13;
management of KWSB, recognizes the need to achieve short term improvements in the WSS performance, while developing approaches to&#13;
sustain these improvements into the future. KWSB has approached WSP-SA to assist it in developing an appropriate reform program, focusing&#13;
on institutional reforms and improvements in downward accountability to consumers, through considering the institutional options for reform,&#13;
analyzing baseline data and benchmarks for the success of reforms, undertake immediate service delivery improvements (specifically through&#13;
the judicious use of PPPs) and developing a reform communication and consultation strategy to improve downward accountability for outcomes&#13;
and strengthen consumer voice. These activities are also designed to enhance the creditworthiness of the KWSB, thereby attracting greater&#13;
domestic private sector interest in financing future KWSB activities.&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Improved coverage of sanitation services in all WSP-SA countries and a network of key sanitation sector&#13;
professionals established for an outcome oriented sanitation approaches across South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Out of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG), three are directly linked with sanitation: reducing child&#13;
mortality, combating diseases, and ensuring environmental sustainability. The World Summit of Sustainable Development in August 2002 has&#13;
set the sanitation target of halving the proportion if people without adequate sanitation by 2015. Although much has been achieved in last&#13;
decade, the sanitation picture is still dismal in South Asia. Only 39% of the population in the region has adequate sanitation facilities. The&#13;
practice of open defecation by the majority of the people in the regions is a serious threat to the environment and control of diseases. Resource&#13;
allocation for sanitation in many Asian countries tilts towards capital investment with little or no emphasis on behavior change and meeting safe,&#13;
sanitary, and public health outcomes. Consequently, the most vulnerable and marginalized population in both urban and rural areas has the least&#13;
access to sanitation facilities. Experience during the past two decades has shown that conventional sanitation program could not bring about&#13;
desired improvements. The SACOSAN conference was organized to bring high profile policy makers, sector professionals and donors into a&#13;
common platform of understanding the regional concerns. The Dhaka Declaration was drawn up to this effect to reach a consensus on way&#13;
forward of improving the sector and meeting the MDGs. WSP was instrumental in catalyzing the SASOCAN I and facilitated the consensus&#13;
among sector leaders to sign the Dhaka Declaration. To keep the momentum of meeting common goals across the region, there is a need for&#13;
constant advocacy on the reform principles across the region, support a series o networking events and facilitate active regional cross exchanges&#13;
for sector professionals to innovative practices for cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches. This would include a variety of regional activities&#13;
to support countries to design appropriate country policies and take strategic decisions in translating policies into real time action plans. The&#13;
main thrust of the project to institutionalize a regional sanitation approach for South Asia.&#13;
&#13;

1.   WSP-SA focused countries continue to give priority to sanitation&#13;
2.   Regional development partners sustains the importance of sanitation in their agenda&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Efficient service delivery arrangements in place through improved understanding of different options&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Services are failing with inadequate and inefficient management of urban water supply system. The main reason behind&#13;
this is centralized utilities with weak management practices and lack of downward accountability to consumers. Reforms are necessary to&#13;
improve efficiency and service expansion. There are emerging examples and experiences of utility restructuring within South Asia. The project&#13;
aims to achieve the overall project's objective of facilitating access to technical assistance and capacity support to utility institutional reforms in&#13;
the water and sanitation sector in South Asia, within the context of decentralized local governance, appropriate options with efficiency gains in&#13;
service provision.&#13;

Task Manager:              Vandana Mehra&#13;
Client:                    National, State and Local governments, Nodal departments&#13;
Region:                    South Asia&#13;
Partners:                  AUSAID, SDC, Danida, (TBD)&#13;
&#13;
Desired Outcome: Enhanced capacity of governments to initiate, design and implement water and sanitation sector reforms in partnership with&#13;
the private sector and NGOs; Establishment of a critical mass of informed persons and institutions (e.g. government, politicians, non-&#13;
government, private sector, community members) that are sensitized to the issues of sector reforms, institutional restructuring and serving the&#13;
poor; Leverage government and multi-lateral capacity-support and direct investments in the water and sanitation sector; Regional knowledge&#13;
sharing and lessons on challenges facing the region's WSS sector&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The project activities and related outputs aim to achieve the overall project's objective of facilitating access to technical&#13;
assistance and capacity support to national and local government's institutional reforms in the water and sanitation sector in South Asia, within&#13;
the context of decentralized local governance, with efficiency gains in service provision reaching the poor.&#13;
&#13;
Project Components (Indicative)&#13;
Total sanitation in the Region: The rural and urban sanitation coverage in South Asian countries remains very low. However, in recent years&#13;
there have been some innovative and interesting initiatives in rural sanitation across the region. It is proposed to conduct regional learning&#13;
event(s) that focus on approaches to ignite change and create awareness for total sanitation. Sharing different innovative country experience&#13;
(both in rural and urban sanitation) and drawing lessons from those would support the stakeholders in the countries to formulate their national&#13;
programs. WSP-SA intends to support this effort by analyzing selected cases and disseminate findings to the stakeholders in the South Asian&#13;
countries via a Study on Rural Sanitation in South Asian Countries. Findings of this study would be disseminated through learning event(s) and&#13;
specifically at SACOSAN 2, scheduled to be held in Pakistan in Oct 2006. Additionally, specific activities/ events will be supported to provide&#13;
support SACOSAN 2 or similar regional activity in urban or rural sanitation (supporting international speakers, creating media awareness, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
Establishing critical mass of informed persons and institutions: Besides other stakeholders, an important stakeholder in the reform process is&#13;
the elected representative (politician). There is a felt need to sensitize elected representatives of the three focus countries (Bangladesh/ India/&#13;
Pakistan) on the issues facing governments in the delivery of WSS services, and on the need for undertaking reforms to provide equitable,&#13;
sustainable and efficient water supply and sewerage (WSS) services. Study trips/ workshops or learning events are planned with the objective of&#13;
informing the politicians, and other critical mass of persons (viz. government, politicians, non-government, private sector, utility reps, civil&#13;
society, media) and starting the process of frank, open and informed debate on the challenges and options facing the WSS sector. The&#13;
information-sharing is expected to lead to awareness among stakeholders, and provide support when the reform actions take off.&#13;
&#13;
Sharing lessons on mitigating chemical hazards of natural origin in drinking water quality: Between 20 and 30 million people are&#13;
considered to be at risk from excess of arsenic in drinking water across Bangladesh alone, that is, 25 per cent of its population. A total of 66&#13;
million people are estimated to be at risk from excess of fluoride across India in 16 affected states out of 35, that is, more than 5 per cent of the&#13;
total population. It is proposed to support exchange of experience and lessons on the role of local governments in managing and sustaining water&#13;
and sanitation services specifically in tackling the drinking water quality challenge. Experience sharing would focus how an an effective&#13;
approach to mitigation required an understanding of both the technology and the institutions of service delivery. Bangladesh has gone through a&#13;
decade of learning and it's story offers a wealth of information for the region&#13;
&#13;

EWDSA/REG/37:              Regional Review of Water Quality Management                                                                    Year: 1 of 1&#13;
Task Manager:              Khawaja M. Minnatullah&#13;
Client:                    GoI and 3 state governments therein (GoWB, GoM and GoK), GoB, GoP, GoN and GoSL&#13;
Regional:                  South Asia&#13;
Partners:                  SASEI, SASES, SASRD, AusAid, AsDB, DFID, WHO, UNICEF&#13;
&#13;
Desired Outcome: Partner Governments adopt a water quality risk management policy framework.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The trend towards decentralization across South Asia, combined with a rising incidence of drinking water contamination,&#13;
poses particular challenges for the South Asia Region. This demands an effective and responsive decentralized system for identification and&#13;
response to drinking water contamination. More so, the `need of the hour' in water quality responses in the Region is to move from a crisis&#13;
approach, to a more systemic water quality regulatory framework that is designed to identify and respond to water quality issues - at large.&#13;
&#13;
By taking up this subject at a regional level, WSP-SA would seek to gain greater leverage over: i) on-going and projected WSS projects from&#13;
bilaterals and multilaterals across the region, and ii) raise country awareness, understanding and policy-making in the water quality domain by&#13;
raising the profile of this subject in the public debate.&#13;
&#13;
The project will cover both microbial and chemical aspects with potentially :&#13;
     -     Kerala-India and Sri Lanka to represent widespread types of microbial contamination,&#13;
     -     West Bengal-India, Bangladesh and Nepal to illustrate the arsenic issue,&#13;
     -     Maharashtra-India and Pakistan to illustrate the fluoride issue.&#13;
&#13;
This project aims to build water quality into a regulatory framework of health risk management. In approaching this issue from a health&#13;
perspective, addressing the issue of appropriate response mechanisms must be an essential pre-requisite to the development of a robust water&#13;
quality framework. In this context and in a decentralizing service delivery environment, the premier challenge is the identification of the&#13;
appropriate functions to be performed at appropriate levels - given the obvious capacity and resource constraints.&#13;
&#13;
Ultimately, the project would attempt at organizing the many findings into a sound analytical framework, distinguishing between crisis&#13;
management and risk management, between microbial pollution of shallow aquifers and chemical pollution of natural origin of deeper aquifers,&#13;
between approaches to point sources and piped systems. Also, the project should help raise the broader issues of responsibility over public&#13;
health against ownership of infrastructure assets, and discuss the boundary between localized pollution of drinking water sources and wider&#13;
environmental problems from agricultural and industrial activities impact on the water resources base at large.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   WSP-SA has capitalized sufficient experience from individual activities on water quality across Bangladesh and India to position itself as&#13;
an influential player in regional water quality policy debates&#13;
2.   There is a general recognition among stakeholders of the limitations of the crisis management approach (surveys and treatment) and a&#13;
readiness to move toward a more comprehensive and systematic approach to water quality&#13;
3.   There are some commonalities in water quality issues across the region, which could possibly be addressed through by a similar water&#13;
quality framework. The definition of such a framework at regional level will ensure that policy advocacy at the country level is made more&#13;
effective&#13;

Client:                   Client countries and Development Agencies&#13;
Region:                   Global and Country&#13;
Partners:                 Client countries, WSP, WB, USAID, UNICEF, Centers for Disease Control, small and large soap manufacturers.&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: At the country level, to significantly increase the incidence of handwashing with soap among poor women and children&#13;
and reduce the incidence of diarrhea morbidity and mortality among children; at the global level, along with partners, to advocate the importance of&#13;
handwashing as a key method of reducing diarrhea and encourage more countries to take up such programs. This long-term outcome will flow from&#13;
the shorter term outcome of an increased number of country handwashing programs with adequate funding, staffing, and knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: The Public-Private Partnership to Promote the Practice of Handwashing with Soap, was initiated in early 02 by the WSP and&#13;
the WB. Country level projects are underway in Ghana, Madagascar, Peru, Senegal, and Nepal with activities planned in Columbia, Indonesia, and&#13;
Tanzania. The initiative's global steering committee provides technical assistance to country programs, arranges for cross-country learning and&#13;
conducts advocacy at major international events. The Secretariat's role is to support the existing country handwashing programs, identify and&#13;
facilitate the establishment of new country programs, fundraise, support the Partnerships and Steering Committee, and provide advocacy, knowledge&#13;
sharing, and research on handwashing.&#13;

Region:                  Global&#13;
Partners:                Water Anchor, Bank regions, other World Bank global programs (e.g. DevCom, WBI, CommNet), other development&#13;
                         communication partners (e.g. Comm+ Alliance, Communication Initiative, Africa Water Journalist Network, Africa Water&#13;
                         Media Network), global/regional/national development institutions (e.g, Adam Smith, WaterAid, GTZ, World Water&#13;
                         Council, International Water Association), other WSP GPTs&#13;
&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: Strategic communication interventions are employed by WSP programs as effective management mechanisms to engage&#13;
and sustain broad stakeholder participation and dialogue on reform processes in WSS.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: During its two-decade existence as a knowledge and advocacy agency, WSP has increasingly employed strategic&#13;
communication approaches to facilitate effective engagement in programs on reform advocacy, public participation, social accountability and&#13;
behavior-change. There is increasing appreciation in the traditionally technically-oriented water supply and sanitation sector that the challenge of&#13;
achieving the MDGs requires a significant increase in the quantity and quality of communications. WSP-AF communication and advocacy activities&#13;
in Africa, EAP, LAC and SA confirm the critical role played by strategic communications in building political goodwill, acceptance and support for&#13;
WSS sector reforms; sustaining the momentum of the reform processes; stimulating policy dialogue and mitigating the political risks associated with&#13;
sector/utility reforms. WSP has been providing technical assistance for the development and implementation of reform communication strategies&#13;
(Kenya - Africa), and strengthening the capacities of country clients to manage communication on sector/sub-sector/ utility reforms (India, Zambia&#13;
and Peru ­ SA, Africa and LAC). WSP has also been supporting initiatives to sustain policy dialogue and providing communication support to&#13;
national/local level sector institutions (Mozambique, Uganda and Indonesia (Africa and EAP) as well as learning networks (RWSN and AfricaSan).&#13;
Currently, there is increasing demand from WSP partners and clients to boost their capacities for strategic reform communications, and also to&#13;
support communication and advocacy interventions that respond to WSS challenges. This is considered to be an important new line of business for&#13;
WSP. These demands present an exciting opportunity for the WSP Global Practice Team on Communications to consolidate WSP's current&#13;
approaches into a coherent strategic communication program that can increase its impact and influence on sector reform processes. The project seeks&#13;
to strengthen WSP's capacity to support strategic communication initiatives of institutions in WSS; to collaborate with WB global programs&#13;
(DevComm, WBI, etc) and other sector institutions to distill lessons, best practices and share experiences on strategic communication for WSS&#13;
reform and MDG advocacy; to develop innovative global communication products and advocacy tools that improve communication of complex&#13;
issues on WSS.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Continued demand for support from clients across different WSP regions for strategic communication interventions&#13;
2.   Increased communications capacity within WSP to develop strategic communication interventions for varied clients in different WSP regions&#13;
3.   Additional funds mobilized from external support agencies to finance international experience sharing and learning events&#13;

&#13;
  Desired Project Outcome: Use of F-GPT's global synthesis by national /provincial governments in WSP regions for adoption of improved public&#13;
  financial management practices and leveraging additional local finance for increased sustainability of WSS services&#13;
&#13;
  Project Description: Financing is often portrayed as a key challenge in meeting Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water and sanitation.&#13;
  Conventionally, finance is viewed as determining sources of funds for infrastructure investments and many global estimates of finance requirements&#13;
  for the sustainable expansion of water and sanitation coverage point to large funding gaps in public resources and pleas for more aid resources. While&#13;
  additional financing for the sector will be required to meet the MDGs, the emerging consensus suggests a greater focus on efficiency and&#13;
  effectiveness of existing expenditures to make rapid, but sustainable progress. In this regard, the F-GPT has identified two directions as critical for&#13;
  improved use of financial resources in ensuring sustainability of services:&#13;
 i.    improving the public financial management practices (including decentralization and fiscal framework, sector financing strategies and&#13;
       medium-term plans for programmatic approaches, and sector performance monitoring)&#13;
ii.    leveraging additional local resources including market-based domestic financial institutions to ensure sustainability&#13;
&#13;
  WSP has been involved in supporting governments and other stakeholders in focus countries in different regions in developing financing strategies&#13;
       and design of fiscal mechanisms. This project will draw on these experiences to develop a global analysis and synthesis of lessons in these two&#13;
       important dimensions, and to develop appropriate communication products for dissemination and inter-regional experience sharing to improve&#13;
       their use by stakeholders at country and local level on different WSP regions.&#13;
&#13;
  Assumptions:&#13;
  1    Continued demand for support from countries for improved public financial management practices from countries in different WSP regions&#13;
  2    Continued demand for support in leveraging resources from governments and financing agencies in different WSP regions&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Sanitation conditions and hygiene practices improved at scale in 3 countries of WSP regions based on global analysis&#13;
and synthesis of lessons learnt and knowledge shared on marketing sanitation and hygiene approaches..&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Meeting the sanitation MDG will require sharp efforts at all levels. The sector is often characterized by institutional&#13;
fragmentation, demand incoherently expressed, inappropriate products, poor services, unsustainable financing systems, etc.. WSP has championed&#13;
several sanitation and hygiene approaches. In the Africa region, WSP has developed the strategic sanitation planning and is rolling out sanitation&#13;
marketing programs in selected countries. In South Asia and East Asia and Pacific regions, WSP is supporting community-led total sanitation&#13;
programs in selected countries. In Latin America, WSP has implemented the condominium sanitation programs in selected countries. In the Africa&#13;
region, WSP has also pioneered the PHAST technique for hygiene promotion in several countries and for several years it has facilitated a PHAST&#13;
network. In the 4 regions, WSP is supporting several PPP hand washing programs. While tremendous progress has been made, most of the programs&#13;
remain islands of success with regard to the increasing number of people to be served. Three pillars seem to be important for the design, the&#13;
implementation and monitoring of large scale sanitation and hygiene promotion programs. The demand for improved sanitation is determinant to&#13;
provide what people want, are willing to pay for, will use, maintain and value. The supply-side for sanitation is determinant to ensure reliable,&#13;
affordable and sustainable sanitation services and products. The enabling environment (institutional arrangements, financing, regulation, capacity&#13;
building, policy, political commitment, etc.) is key to linking the demand and the supply. But more importantly, all approaches are using the power of&#13;
the market from either the public-goods (e.g. public health safeguarding) or the private-goods (e.g. power of the market) perspectives to promote&#13;
sustainable sanitation solutions. The project aims to develop a global analysis and synthesis of different approaches (sanitation marketing, total&#13;
sanitation, condominium system, hygiene promotion techniques, etc.) under the framework of these three pillars, the market power, and strengthen&#13;
the linkages between sanitation and hygiene promotion.. The project also aims to develop a global strategy for knowledge dissemination, a&#13;
community of practice to network and share experiences and best practices through existing WSP initiatives and tools such as the regional sanitation&#13;
movements (AfricaSan, SacoSan, EASAN, LatinSan), and the global sanitation web portal (SANICON)...&#13;

Desired Project Outcome: Sustainable large-scale RWSS programs designed and implemented by our clients with increased funding from&#13;
government budgets, donors, private sector, and incorporating a wide range of management options&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: RWSS provision, which probably presents the biggest challenge for meeting the WSS MDGs, is in dire need of new thinking&#13;
and innovative approaches to raise its profile and attract more investment resources, new and expanded management and financing options,&#13;
institutional reforms and a framework to sustain investments at scale. Decentralization is a key trend worldwide that places greater responsibility for&#13;
service provision on local governments but their capacity for planning, implementing, coordinating and monitoring RWSS provision is limited at a&#13;
time when meeting RWSS targets requires investments at scale. As countries prepare to move to large scale RWSS programs, there is need to provide&#13;
knowledge on options for institutional framework that will support large scale programs in a context where discreet project implementation has been&#13;
the norm. RWSS is increasingly being implemented in multi-sectoral projects/programs as well as within the wider context of rural development ­&#13;
this is a good trend that should be encouraged. To increase the impact and profile of RWSS, investments will need stronger linkages with other&#13;
sectors (such as health, agriculture, education, etc.). There are also gaps in knowledge regarding the relationship between RWSS and poverty&#13;
reduction and economic growth which this project will seek to address. Capacity and mechanisms for measuring RWSS outcomes and impacts have&#13;
been weak. The project will contribute to developing a module for outcome and impact assessment of large scale RWSS investments ­ this will be&#13;
key for measuring progress towards improving access to sustainable RWSS services and identifying bottlenecks as well as best practice. The Rural&#13;
GPT is responsible for delivering this project which is a major step towards re-establishing WSP's global leadership of RWSS.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.   Decentralization of service delivery continues to be supported by governments and financing agencies&#13;
2.   RWSS agencies are willing to apply and use lessons shared and learnt&#13;
3.   Additional funds mobilized by external support agencies to finance international sharing and learning events&#13;

&#13;
Desired Project Outcome: The outcome of the project is to (i) implement the performance indicators assessment into the day-to-day practice of&#13;
water utilities that will help them to improve performance and provide better services, (ii) provide multiple stakeholders with access to comparable&#13;
utility performance data through a website based network that is financially sustainable and with up to date content; (iii) to give donors an objective&#13;
information of the sector performance on the basis of the actual performance data from the first hand.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description: Benchmarking is an important tool to provide information to a range of stakeholders about utility and sector performance, at&#13;
national, regional, and international levels. The goal of the IBNet is to improve service delivery through the provision of international comparative&#13;
benchmark performance information to a wide range of stakeholders (utility benchmarkers, policy makers, international financial institutions, sector&#13;
professionals). IBNet is to be designed as an easy to use system with low barriers to participation, and providing users with access to performance&#13;
results, and background information on benchmarking. In the past few years, the Bank/WSP made steps to develop such an international&#13;
benchmarking system by trying to reduce the key barriers which make comparisons difficult. To that effect, the Bank has worked to develop a suite&#13;
of software, which facilitates benchmarking through a standard set of indicators. The second phase of this Benchmarking Initiative is currently under&#13;
implementation, and aims to (i) expand coverage to include more utilities in the website based database, which at the start of the project included 100&#13;
utilities in more than 15 countries; and (ii) build the sustainability of IBNET in terms of content and financing. The IBNet website www.ib-net.org&#13;
will contain information on more than 1000 utilities from about 60 countries.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1.    Utilities are willing to participate in the network and provide updated data on a routine basis&#13;
2.    The network results meet the needs of the different groups of end-users, including utilities, decision makers and international donors.&#13;
3.    Funding is found funding for the continued operation and maintenance of the network for the next 3 years&#13;
&#13;
Start Date: Mar 03                                             End Date Mar 07&#13;
&#13;
Project Milestones:&#13;
1.    Data on performance results from a wide range of utilities increases by 50% on the website (as compared to Mar 05) - Mar 06&#13;
2.    An increase of 50% (as compared to Jun 05) in the usage of performance results from IBNet - Jun 06&#13;
&#13;
Indicators of Outcome:&#13;
1.    At least five country sector development programs are developed on the basis of the IBNet indicator activities - Jun 06&#13;
2.    A donor agrees to provide 100% of funding for IBNet for the next two years ­ Jun 06&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Project Update: 7/05 Change in Task Manager in October 2004; The project started much later than anticipated due to the long time it took to&#13;
  secure the funding, while progress in the first 18 months has been relatively slow, which makes it quite likely that achieving the milestones&#13;
  (especially with the production of a plan for the longer-term sustainability of IBNET may require additional time past the closing date of the&#13;
  project)&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Each year the Water and Sanitation
            Program (WSP) engages with client countries, partners and
            other stakeholders in a process of developing a work plan
            for the coming fiscal year (July 1 - June 30). This document
            presents the fiscal year 2006 (FY06) business plan. guidance
            received during this meeting. The FY06 business plan is
            divided into six sections, a global framework, four regional
            chapters following the organizational structure of WSP -
            Africa, East Asia/Pacific, Latin America/Caribbean, and
            South Asia - and the global activities. Each regional
            chapter includes a regional strategy that outlines the
            particular challenges, opportunities, and strategies for the
            water and sanitation sector in that region. The regional
            strategies lead to country and thematic strategies that
            further define the role WSP will play in its focus
            countries. The regional chapters include summary
            descriptions of the activities to be implemented as annual
            work plans. Annex 1 presents the individual project sheets
            that expand the description in a simplified log-frame
            structure, with special emphasis on intermediate and final
            outcomes and indicators.
