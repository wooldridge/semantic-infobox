            Market power : ports - a case study of
            post-privatization mergers
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            An emerging issue to privatized
            infrastructure sectors is how regulators should deal with
            proposed mergers that could potentially increase market
            power and lead to anticompetitive behavior. This note looks
            at the issues in the port sector, discussing the regulatory
            treatment of vertical and horizontal mergers. It focuses on
            Argentina, one of the first countries to concession its
            ports. In the early 1990s Argentina restructured and
            privatized its port system. As part of this process the
            government transferred ports to the provinces, which could
            choose to operate, concession, or close them. The note also

            and the pros and cons of explicitly prohibiting horizontal
            mergers between terminal operators.
