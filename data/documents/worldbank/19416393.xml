Attachment 1&#13;
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative Charter&#13;
Adopted on July 6, 2007 and amended on July 11, 2013&#13;
(provided for informational purposes only)&#13;
1.    Introduction&#13;
1.1   The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD") and the&#13;
International Development Association ("IDA") (collectively, the "Bank"), the International&#13;
Monetary Fund ("IMF") and all donors ("Donors") to one or more trust funds (collectively, the&#13;
"Trust Fund") for the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative ("FIRST") have&#13;
adopted the present charter (the "Charter").&#13;
1.2   Launched in 2002, FIRST is a collaborative arrangement providing for a technical&#13;
assistance ("TA") facility designed to support growth and poverty reduction in low- and&#13;
middle-income countries by promoting stable, deep and diverse financial sectors. The FIRST&#13;
arrangement is built upon close collaboration between the Bank and the IMF, both to leverage&#13;
institutional expertise, and as the designated implementing agencies for FIRST TA. This&#13;
arrangement also seeks to promote collaboration among a wide range of institutions, including&#13;
other bilateral agencies and multilateral development banks.&#13;
1.3   The Charter sets out the governance arrangements of FIRST that encapsulate this&#13;
collaborative arrangement.&#13;
2.    Basic Principles&#13;
2.1   Following are basic principles that will guide FIRST (the "Basic Principles"):&#13;
2.1.1 A demand-driven approach with open access&#13;
FIRST aims to be demand-driven and open in its approach, as a strong advocate of financial&#13;
sector development, and seeks to identify effective new ideas and modalities in the delivery of&#13;
TA. To this end, FIRST accepts technical assistance requests from a wide range of sources for&#13;
the benefit of client countries. As the designated implementing entities, the Bank and the IMF&#13;
will prepare funding proposals to be considered for FIRST financing.&#13;
2.1.2 Additionality&#13;
FIRST seeks to ensure that it funds activities that are complementary to those being funded&#13;
from other sources and that its funding does not substitute for or displace more suitable or&#13;
appropriate assistance available from other sources. FIRST seeks to excel in efforts to promote&#13;
learning and knowledge sharing in the area of financial sector TA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-8-&#13;
2.1.3 Harmonization, transparency, and accountability&#13;
FIRST promotes a model of partnership in line with the principles of: ownership, alignment,&#13;
harmonization, managing for results and mutual accountability. For FIRST, this involves&#13;
introducing clear accountabilities in program management, setting targets, assessing&#13;
effectiveness, and monitoring results. FIRST's partnership model also seeks to promote&#13;
learning and knowledge sharing.&#13;
2.1.4  TA Beneficiaries&#13;
(a)   Beneficiaries of FIRST TA are policy makers, regulatory bodies, government&#13;
agencies, international financial institutions, and, under limited circumstances, quasi-&#13;
public institutions (such as self-regulatory organizations and industry associations).&#13;
(b)   Beneficiaries of FIRST assistance must be from either low- or middle-income&#13;
countries at the time project proposals receive final approval. "Low-income countries"&#13;
are those defined by the Bank as eligible to receive low or no interest credits or grants&#13;
from IDA. "Middle-income countries" are those defined by the Bank as eligible to&#13;
receive IBRD financing.&#13;
3.    Objectives&#13;
3.1   FIRST's overall objective is to help strengthen financial systems in low- and middle-&#13;
income countries so that they make a strong and positive contribution to economic growth and&#13;
help reduce poverty and income inequality. FIRST's activities are currently only those financed&#13;
by the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   FIRST's specific areas of focus are to:&#13;
3.2.1 Finance TA in the areas of financial sector regulation, supervision and development in&#13;
response to country demands, provide support to countries to strengthen their financial systems&#13;
or implement standards and codes in advance of Financial Sector Assessment Programs&#13;
("FSAPs") or Reports on Standards and Codes ("ROSCs"), and facilitate systematic follow-up&#13;
of related recommendations.&#13;
3.2.2 Advise on the preparation and implementation of action plans, development programs&#13;
and reforms in the financial sector.&#13;
3.2.3 Promote coordination in the delivery of financial sector TA and capacity building,&#13;
drawing particularly on private sector expertise.&#13;
3.2.4 Support research on and the dissemination of best practices and useful tools related to&#13;
financial sector reform and development in low- and middle-income countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-9-&#13;
3.2.5 Work with international standard-setting bodies and other relevant partners to broaden&#13;
the base of providers supporting countries' efforts to implement standards and codes in&#13;
accordance with FSAP and ROSC recommendations and strengthen their financial systems.&#13;

safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening&#13;
procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the&#13;
Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under&#13;
Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this&#13;
provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and&#13;
asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country that&#13;
may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and&#13;
shall be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund may be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in&#13;
its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars&#13;
(the "Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3   Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution&#13;
Currency other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the&#13;
accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding&#13;
Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where&#13;
deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 15 -&#13;
neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional&#13;
financing.&#13;
2.4   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the&#13;
date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the&#13;
investment of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from&#13;
such investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.    Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;

management and Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage&#13;
deduction specified above as an administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the&#13;
Administration .Agreements in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures&#13;
shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a maximum of eleven point seventy&#13;
six percent (11.76%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements. The&#13;
Donors acknowledge and agree that such costs will be approved each year on the basis of&#13;
annual budget amounts presented to the Governing Council.&#13;
3.3   Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this&#13;
Trust Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If&#13;
actual Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of&#13;
signature of the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund&#13;
fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new&#13;
Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration&#13;
Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.    Transfers to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)&#13;

IMF to set forth the terms and conditions of any Trust Fund funds transferred to them.&#13;

financed by the Transferred Funds; (ii) providing Donors with financial, progress, results or&#13;
impact reporting for activities financed by the Transferred Funds; and (iii) any misuse or&#13;
misprocurement with respect to the Transferred Funds; or (iv) pursuing any Donor interests or&#13;
IMF undertakings with respect to the Transferred Funds.&#13;
4.3   The Donors further acknowledge and agree that any financial reports with respect to the&#13;
Trust Fund funds transferred to the IMF and the reports with respect to the progress of the&#13;
implementation of IMF activities are the responsibility of the IMF.&#13;

all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost&#13;
of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
5.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to&#13;
whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the&#13;
appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and&#13;
terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit,&#13;
including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the&#13;
requesting Donor.&#13;
6.    Progress Reporting&#13;
6.1    The Bank shall provide the Donors with annual reports on the progress of activities&#13;
financed by the Contributions. Within six (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as&#13;

information within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated&#13;
costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood&#13;

the Trust Fund.&#13;
7.    Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
7.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the&#13;
Bank by May 31, 2018 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than&#13;
returns to Donors) after such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with&#13;
