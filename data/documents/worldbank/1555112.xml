NUTRITION AND FOOD NEEDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
This study presents an assessment of the problem of food supply and&#13;
distribution in selected developing countries. Using fresh empirical&#13;
evidence from household budget surveys, aggregate food supply and&#13;
income distribution, two main conclusions are reached. First, the&#13;
pattern of calorie consumption appears to be rather similar in the&#13;
,sample of countries considered, once variations of income and prices&#13;
are taken into account. Second, if food prices increase and/or income&#13;
distribution deteriorates in accordance with past trends, increases _n&#13;
aggregate supplies of food would be insufficient to eliminate mal-&#13;
nutrition in the next two decades. Therefore, food programs and market&#13;
interventions will be necessary to reduce the severity of malnutrition&#13;
and to reach certain segments of the malnourished population.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
This study, prepared as part of the Food Security Policy Work&#13;
Program, has been prepared primarily to present and apply a methodology&#13;
for forecasting food supplies and needs: the results obtained for indi-&#13;
vidual countries are not necessarily suitable for use as a basis for&#13;
policy making at national levels.&#13;
The study was the product of the efforts of many people. First,&#13;
for the arduous task of dealing with the data, the methodology and the&#13;
projections,credit is due to the following researchers: L. Clyburn,&#13;
J. Curling, L. Harbert, Y. Kimaro, J. Li, P. O'Brien, S. Velji and&#13;
T. Williams. Mr. L. Harbert coordinated much of the empirical work.&#13;
Ms. J. Li conducted the econometric work related to the cross-country&#13;
estimates and made substantial contributions to the methodology. Ms. C. Hwa&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01      Food security has been traditionally interpreted as the provision&#13;
of adequate and secure fbod supplies at a country or regional level. This&#13;
definition, however, fails to recognize that food security in developing&#13;
countries presents two crucial dimensions. The first is the general&#13;
problem of constrained food availability - of low growth In agricultural&#13;
output, compounded by high variability in yields and quality of the produce,&#13;
and foreign exchange limitations to the importation of food.    The second&#13;
a serious malnutrition problem of the poorest groups, who suffer from an&#13;
inadequate intake of calories and other nutrients because they lack the&#13;
income to buy a sufficient quantity of food.&#13;
1.02      While the general problem of constrained food availability has&#13;
received the attention of many empirical studies, the nutritional probl-&#13;
has been somewhat neglected because of the difficulty of drawing distribu-&#13;
tional conclusions on the basis of the aggregate data available for develop-&#13;
ing countries.  Starting from a set of data from household consumption su 'ys,&#13;
this paper therefore attempts to explore some of the aspects of this neglected&#13;
dimension of food security by focussing on the distribution of calorie&#13;
intake across income groups of selected developing countries: Bangladesh,&#13;
India, Indonesia, Morocco, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.&#13;
1.03      Although the cases for study were chosen mainly on the ba;ls of&#13;
the availability of reliable statistical information, the countries sceLcted&#13;
have in common a number of important characteristics.    First, by virtue of&#13;
their size, income levels and food supplies, the six countries studied&#13;
include the largest regional and aggregate concentrations of poverty ln the&#13;
world. Second, all the countries have a per capita income below $200 in the&#13;
base year and, with the exception of Morocco, are located in Asia. Third, the&#13;
degree of income inequality is at the same time absolutely high as compared to&#13;
average standards, but low in comparison to the inequality of many middle&#13;
income countries in Africa and Latin America. In the countries included in&#13;
this study, the poorest 252 of the population share from 10 to 18% of total&#13;
income, while the richest 252 receive up to 482 of total income; this skewness&#13;
of distribution is reflected to a considerable degree in the inequality of&#13;
food consumption.&#13;
1.04      The methodology of the study is based on estimates of the relation-&#13;
ship between calorie consumption and income levels using both intra-country&#13;
aggregate data by income class and cr.os-country pooled data. The estimated&#13;
relationships are then used jointly with supply function estimates obtained&#13;
from other studies to project aggregate consumption and supply conditiors to&#13;
1985 and 1995 and to estimate the nutrition and total food gaps in thes.&#13;
years before and after food price adjustments. Price responsiveness is both&#13;
directly estimated and introduced in the demand function by estimating t'e&#13;
income effect of a shift in the price of aggregate food under the assume tion&#13;
that, at the low income levels of the countries in question, there is&#13;
little scope for direct substitution between food and other commodities.&#13;

1.05      This paper contains four major sections together with annexes on&#13;
the study methodology and supporting tables on the results. The first section&#13;
describes briefly the approach and methodology used. The second section&#13;
outlines the major results with regard to the distribution of calorie intakes&#13;
and the income elasticities of the various income groups. This section also&#13;
contains estimates of the malnourished population in the base year and&#13;
develops projections of various indicators of nutrition levels for 1985 and&#13;
1995 without regard to price adjustments. The third section introduces&#13;
the supply function estimates and presents the implications for self-suffi-&#13;
ciency and historical levels of food imports on the nutritional status of the&#13;
malnourished and the aggregate food needs. A concluding section reviews&#13;
all results and presents recommendations in regards to improving food and&#13;
nutrition policies in the countries studied.&#13;

II. BACKGROUND, DEFINITIONS AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
2.01      To set the background for the analysis of food needs and malnutri-&#13;
tion, it is useful to review the work of other studies that examine the 'ood&#13;
situation in developing countries. Within the Bank, two major works have&#13;
been completed. The first of these provides a background to the present&#13;
study, in the form of estimates of the foodgrain situation of developing&#13;
countries in 1985. I/ Using the trend growth in foodgrain production ' tween&#13;
1960 to 1975, the supply of foodgrains is projected to 1985. The differences&#13;
between projected demand and supply are the estimates of the aggregate food&#13;
deficits or surpluses in a set of developing countries.&#13;
2.02      The other major work provides both additional empirical background&#13;
as well as some of the theoretical foundations for this study. 2/ It uses a&#13;
low-response relationship between calorie consumption and income based on some&#13;
evidence from cross-country estimates of average consumption valUes to project&#13;
consumption and nutritional gaps for a large number of developing countries.&#13;
One of the main empirical questions emerging from the study is whether the&#13;
estimated low increase in calorie consumption associated with income irncreases&#13;
is actually found in developing countries when consumption patterns of different&#13;
groups rather than national average are compared. 3/ If the calorie responses&#13;
to income increases are low, then 'normal' rates of income growth would have&#13;
relatively minor impact toward eliminating malnutrition, and direct distribu-&#13;
tion systems and food subsidies would be needed to supplement market distribu-&#13;
tion.  As a result of!this low responsiveness, the study proposes that:&#13;
"Malnutrition is unlikely to disappear in the normal course&#13;
of development: that is, in the course of normal per capita&#13;
income growth, even with greater emphasis on expansion of&#13;
food production barring, of course, unusual technological&#13;
break-throughs."4/&#13;
2.01      The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has also&#13;
conducted studies of food needs in developing countries.5/    In these studies,&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
consumption, food needs and food gaps in 1990 are estimated. Consumption&#13;
and production are projected using growth rates in income and trends in&#13;
production. Food needs are estimated by taking an average calorie require-&#13;
ment, increasing it by 10% to account for the maldistribution of calories&#13;
within countries, and multiplying it by the projected population for 1990.&#13;
The issue raised by the IFPRI studies is whether the 10% factor applied&#13;
uniformly across countries is a close enough estimate to account for the&#13;
various differences in the distribution of income, nutrition preferences and&#13;
habits, and hence differences in calorie consumption over income groups in&#13;
developing countries. For the purpose of achieving a regional or worldwide&#13;
estimate of food needs, such a factor increase may be sufficient to give&#13;
"order of magnitude" estimates. It is certainly not sufficiently accurate to&#13;
yield specific country estimates of food deficits or to determine the extent&#13;
and severity of malnutrition in developing countries.&#13;
Definitions&#13;
2.04      A number of concepts in the analysis require explanation. The&#13;
calorie requirement is the minimum amount of calorie intake considered&#13;
socially desirable for all individuals. For the purposes of this analysis it&#13;
is assumed to be equal to a calorie requirement calculated using the FAQ/WHO&#13;
methodology minus an allowance (of about 200 calories) to take into account&#13;
individual variations of basic energy needs and variations of social stand-&#13;
ards.1/ Food needs is the total amount of food that is necessary to meet&#13;
both market demand and, if properly distributed between households and within&#13;
families, to eliminate the calorie deficits of the poor. The availability&#13;
of an amount of food equal to "food needs" would not necessarily alleviate&#13;
malnutrition. Distributional systems would be needed to disburse food such&#13;
that each income group formerly deficient in calorie intake receives just&#13;
sufficient additional food to bring calorie consumption up to, but not&#13;
exceeding, adequate calorie levels. However, the part of the population&#13;
with high incomes would continue to consume above their calorie requirements,&#13;
as dictated by their preferences and resulting food expenditure. Also, even&#13;
if food were made available to a household in an amount that would meet or&#13;
even exceed its average calorie requirements, maldistribution of food within&#13;
the household could still result in malnutrition for some members, in partic-&#13;
ular women and young children. Therefore, in an economic and political system&#13;
that allows consumption above requirements according to preferences and&#13;
income, "food needs" is the minimum requirement for food availability to&#13;
provide adequate calories for the population; but even this may not be effective&#13;
without the presence of other conditions. The availability of "food needs"&#13;
is thus a necessary but not a sufficient condition for eliminating mal-&#13;
nutrition.&#13;

2.05      To measure the magnitude of the distributional aspects of malnutri-&#13;
tion another measure is used, the nutritional Rap. The "nutritional gap"&#13;
is the difference between the calorie intake of the malnourishec population&#13;
and their recommended calorie intake plus an allowance (again of about 200&#13;
calories) to take into account waste, maldistribution within the family, and&#13;
time variability of food supplies. Since calorie intake is a function cf&#13;
income, the price of food and its availability, the nutritional gap is as&#13;
much a measure of deficiencies in the distribution of income as it is of the&#13;
distribution of food. The malnourished population or target popuilation f'r&#13;
food policy is that portion of the population with a calorie availabll'.y&#13;
below the requirement.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
2.06      The methodology of this study can be summarized in the form of four&#13;
sequential steps. First, calorie consumption by income groups is estimated&#13;
using data from household consumption surveys: for each country in the&#13;
study, the average quantities of the various food items consumed by ho,eholds&#13;
in each income group are converted to calorie intake levels using FAO&#13;
calorie conversion tables; the distribution of the population by class r-f&#13;
calorie consumption is estimated by interpolating Lorentz curves, and ful,ctions&#13;
relating calorie intake to total expenditure levels (used as proxies for&#13;
disposable incomes) are estimated using weighed regression techniques.&#13;
Because the functional form of the relations estimated allows demand el3sti-&#13;
cities to change with income levels, this procedure gives income class and&#13;
country specific estimates of the responsiveness of calorie consumption to&#13;
expenditure changes. Second, calorie consumption by expenditure class is&#13;
projected for various years under alternative policies affecting the real&#13;
income levels of each group. Third, by comparing these intake levels with&#13;
Lhe calorie requirement, the proportion of the population consuming below the&#13;
norm (and the proportion consuming below other arbitrary levels) are estimated&#13;
for the base period and the projection years 1985 and 1995 under alternative&#13;
assumptions. Fourth, estimates by income class of the deficiencies in&#13;
calorie intake from this requirement are also made and aggregated to yield&#13;
the nutritional gap for the base year, 1985 and 1995.&#13;
2.07      The above procedure, which assumes at first unchanging relative&#13;
prices was also repeated under the assumptions that food prices would adjust&#13;
upward allowing the country to achieve a predetermined level of self-suffici-&#13;
ency. In order to introduce the price effect in the model, two independent&#13;
estimates were obtained by (a) adding a food price term to the calorie-income&#13;
function to reflect the real income effect of price changes for food on per&#13;
capita calorie intake for each income class 1/ and (b) fitting a calorie&#13;
demand equation using the pooled sample of all countries. Also a supply&#13;
function for food was computed by using a range of elasticity estimates from&#13;
econometric studies of agricultural supply for each country in the sample.&#13;
1/ This term equals the income effect in the well known Slutsky de-&#13;
composition of the price response in the demand function.    It is&#13;
likely to closely,reflect the full impact of price variation on&#13;
demand for all consumers for which want-substitution between food&#13;
and non-food is low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
2.08      An important consideration in the use of this methodology is the&#13;
reliability of the household consumption data. A consistency check on the&#13;
data was made by comparing the estimates of aggregate food consumption based&#13;
on the household consumption surveys with the estimates of per capita calorie&#13;
intake derived from aggregate food production and trade data. This consis-&#13;
tency check indicated that the household consumption surveys for Pakistan,&#13;
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Morocco compared closely with aggregate&#13;
figures. For India, household consumption surveys yielded higher consumption&#13;
than aggregate food availability by about 15Z. No adjustments were felt&#13;
warranted on the India data due to the large sample size of the survey and&#13;
the consistency with the results of previous such surveys. As indicated by&#13;
the lower production figures, any bias in the India data would be in a&#13;
direction that would tend to underestimate the extent of malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

III. THE MAGNITUDES OF MALNUTRITION&#13;
Econometric Results: Calorie Distribution and Income Responsiveness&#13;
3.01      Several factors are expected to influence the distributional aspects of&#13;
malnutrition between household, including (i) income levels, (ii) household size,&#13;
(iii) the consumption level already achieved, (iv) the price and availability&#13;
of food, and (v) the specific dietary preferences of the different population&#13;
groups. Using average figures of expenditure classes as observation points,&#13;
however, the estimations show that at least 90% of the variation in the&#13;
average level of calorie intake per capita between households wihin each&#13;
country can be explained by average income levels. Also, across country&#13;
estimates show that at' least 90% of the same variation in the pooled six&#13;
country sample can be explained by differences in average income levels&#13;
(converted at the official exchange rates) and in average food prices.&#13;
3.02      As shown in Table 1, the calorie response to increases in income&#13;
at the calorie poverty line (i.e. at the expenditure level just sufficient to&#13;
purchase the caloric requirement) varies from about 0.6 for Morocco and&#13;
India to 0.5 for Indonesia, 0.4 for Bangladesh, 0.3 for Pakistan and 0.2 for&#13;
Sri Lanka.l/ These magnitudes indicate that individuals consuming just at the&#13;
caloric requirement will increase calorie consumption between 2% and 6% for&#13;
every 10% rise in income. Moreover, the countries with the most significant&#13;
magnitudes of malnutrition - Bangladesh, India and Indonesia - all have&#13;
similarly high and not significantly different (from a statistical point of&#13;
view) income elasticities and hence a high response in calorie consumption&#13;
to income increases. The poorest 10% of the population of these Asian&#13;
countries have calorie income elasticities of between 0.7 and 0.8 indicating&#13;
that a 10% rise in income will increase calorie intake by 7 to 8% for the&#13;
very poorest groups.&#13;

2/ The calorie poverty line is the level of income at which the consumer&#13;
would purchase the calorie requirement.&#13;
1/ Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka have fairly effective food distribution schemes&#13;
that contribute to these calorie elasticities for these countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
3.03      The magnitudes of the calorie responses estimated for each country&#13;
suggest that real income gains of the very poor will have a more primary and&#13;
direct effect on their nutritional status than had been previously concluded&#13;
from cross-country evidence, even if they maintain their existing dietary&#13;
habits and preferences. On the other hand, the fact that higher elasticities&#13;
are associated with the large per capita deficits of the very poor means&#13;
that consumption by a larger part of the population may fall below subsistence&#13;
levels during poor crop years or, as in urban areas, during slumps in economic&#13;
activity. The case for maintaining some type of reserve grain stock and&#13;
distribution system is thereby supported. Furthermore, target group-oriented&#13;
policy measures, such as ration shops and direct income subsidies, can play&#13;
an important role in reducing malnutrition by offsetting price increases,&#13;
directing supplies to those groups who are landless and unemployed, and&#13;
supplementing the food purchasing power of the very poor. Even though a 10%&#13;
growth in income for'the poorest groups would result in an increase in&#13;
calorie consumption of about the same percentage, their consumption level is&#13;
so significantly deficient (30% to 40% of requirements) that direct supple-&#13;
mental food programs would be necessary to eliminate malnutrition. However,&#13;
for the large bulk of the malnourished (those within 80% to 90% of calorie&#13;
requirements) income growth will have a broad and significant impact in&#13;
eliminating malnutrition.&#13;
3.04      In order to further illustrate the implications of the estimated&#13;
response note that, although income growth may tend to eliminate the inter-&#13;
household distributional aspects of malnutrition, the question remains as&#13;
to whether malnutrition may be alleviated under current and projected growth&#13;
rates in per capita income within an acceptable'time horizon. The answer&#13;
depends on three factors: the rate of income growth, the extent to which&#13;
the growth in income is shared among income groups, and whether the real&#13;
price of food rises or declines. In Table 2, the relative range of growth&#13;
rates in per capita income, postulated by the Bank and other sources, are&#13;
shown. They range from relatively low growth rates in per capita income for&#13;
Bangladesh (0.5 to 1.5%) to very high growth rates for Indonesia (2.0 to&#13;
5.0%).&#13;
3.05      Table 2 also shows the number of years (from base year) necessary&#13;
to eliminate the deficits in calorie intakes for all but 5% of the population&#13;
for each country. Under the low growth rate in per capita income, the&#13;
prospects of income growth eliminating the distributional aspects of malnu-&#13;
trition without supplementary food programs are dismal. However, if income&#13;
growth at the higher expected levels is achieved, it appears that, except in&#13;
Bangladesh and to lesser extent, in India, malnutrition between households&#13;
for nearly all the population may be eliminated within about 30 years, that&#13;
is, if income distribution does not deteriorate by more than 25% of the&#13;
current Gini coefficient and food prices remain constant. If income redis-&#13;
tribution results in a more equitable distribution and high growth rates&#13;
in income are achieved, then malnutrition, at least in terms of having suffi-&#13;
cient food available to the household, may be eliminated within 20 years.&#13;
Thus, the estimated income calorie responses imply that income growth on&#13;
the high end of the expected range could eliminate much of the distribu-&#13;
tional aspect of malnutrition in the countries of this study.&#13;

3.06      The above projections are based on the assumption that food&#13;
availability is sufficient to maintain food prices at about the same level&#13;
as in the base year. However, as further experiments with our demand-supply&#13;
model will show, it appears unlikely that food prices would remain constant&#13;
without price controls or large amounts of imports in these countries.&#13;
Therefore, although Table 2 illustrates the optimistic result of a "what if"&#13;
scenario, it is unlikely that such a scenario will be manifested and that&#13;
malnutrition will be eliminated without supplementary food programs within&#13;
the next two decades.&#13;
3.07      In order to incorporate in the analysis the consequences of price&#13;
changes, we attempted to quantify price responsiveness by (i) computing the&#13;
real income effect of a relative variation in food prices for each country&#13;
and, (ii) estimating a price responsive cross-country demand function for&#13;
calories. Tables 3 and 4 contain the results of these two attempts.&#13;
3.08      As Table 3 shows, the magnitude of the income effect of a food&#13;
price change tends to be compounded by the decline in income as a consequence&#13;
of two factors: (i) the higher income elasticity of calorie demand for&#13;
the poorer consumers and, (ii) the fact that food expenditures are a higher&#13;
proportion of total expenditure the lower is the income.&#13;

3.09      These results are confirmed by the cross-country estimates (Table&#13;
4), whose generally higher values account for (i) the substitution effect&#13;
consequent to a food price increase (ignored in the country estimates) and&#13;
(ii) for the fact that the price variable used is constructed dividing food&#13;
expenditure by calorie intake and thus represents a "calorie" rather than a&#13;
"food" price index.&#13;

1/  Regression results of pooled data (see Appendix).&#13;
3.10      The policy implications of these findings on price elasticities&#13;
tend to run counter to the ones suggested by the income elasticity findings.&#13;
First, while income growth approaching the high end of expected future growth&#13;
could resolve much of the distributional aspect of malnutrition, rises in&#13;
food prices are likely to extend the time horizon for this to occur. Thus,&#13;
while income growth should be emphasized, target group oriented distribution&#13;
of food will continue to be needed if malnutrition is to be alleviated in&#13;
the short-term.&#13;
3.11      Second, a policy that advocates higher prices for food in order to&#13;
stimulate production should also recognize the substantial impact that prices&#13;
have on calorie consumption of the poor and the landless. In Bangladesh and&#13;
India, for example, a 25% rise in the price of food will reduce the already&#13;
deficient calorie intake by an additional 200 to 300 calories for many of&#13;
the poorer income groups that would not benefit directly from any price&#13;
induced income gain.&#13;
3.12      Third, in countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the intra-&#13;
country estimates give some evidence that price rises can occur without such&#13;
a major effect on the nutritional status. Price policies must hence be&#13;
weighted such that the negative aspects on nutritional status of price in-&#13;
creases can be compensated either by income gains or direct food supplements.&#13;
Calorie Consumption Deficits&#13;
3.13       We now move to a more systematic consideration of some measures&#13;
of the extent and severity of malnutrition. The estimates of malnutrition&#13;
obtainable from consumption surveys have basically two components: (i) the&#13;
percentage of households consuming below-the nutritional standard and (ii)&#13;
the size of the nutrient deficit by income group. Table 5 contains estimates&#13;
of the first of these two components for calorie malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
3.14      The estimates indicate that the pattern of malnutrition varies&#13;
significantly from one country to another, and conclusions as to the serious-&#13;
ness of the problem do depend initially on the nutritional standard taken&#13;
as a cut-off level. Thus, for example, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Morocco&#13;
all share the characteristic of having 28% or more of the households with a&#13;
food availability providing less than 90% of the FAO/WHO calorie requirement.&#13;
While Bangladesh and Morocco both have relatively large proportions of their&#13;
population below 1,800 calories per capita and hence more likely to be&#13;
severely malnourished, Pakistan appears to have a negligible part of its&#13;
population in similar conditions.&#13;
3.15      The estimated distribution of calories casts some doubts on the&#13;
definition of malnourishment as based simply on calorie intakes. Since&#13;
many countries have widespread but relatively minor deficits in calorie&#13;
consumption, any conclusion on the level of undernourishment should take&#13;
into account the possibility of complementing energy intakes with othe'r&#13;
nutrients. Furthermore, the percentages of the population below the FAQ/WHO&#13;
standard (Table 3, in Annex) or any arbitrary cut-off line has limited&#13;
significance since (i) chronically undernourished people will have body&#13;
weights and activity levels below the ones implicitly postulated by a&#13;
physiological standard and (ii) the distribution of nutrients within the&#13;
household is likely to be very skewed in favor of male adults.&#13;

3.16      A second, possibly more significant, measure of the extent of mal-&#13;
nutrition is the nutrition gap, or the aggregate difference between food&#13;
(calorie) availability to the households and their calorie requirements.&#13;
This measure focusses on the nutritional deficit, of a country and can be&#13;
related to (i) the size of its undernourished population, (ii) market demand&#13;
and, (Iii) the amount of total food needs (i.e. market demand plus the&#13;
nutrition gap).&#13;

3.17      As Table 6 shows, estimates of the nutritional gap for the survey&#13;
years indicate that the minimum additional distributional needs of the poor&#13;
vary widely from one country to the other both in total and in per capita&#13;
terms. When the aggregate gap is expressed as a percentage of market demand&#13;
or total food needs, however, the countries show a more consistent pattern.&#13;
Thus, with the exception of Sri Lanka, in all countries market demand fails&#13;
to satisfy energy needs by considerable aggregate amounts (from a minimum&#13;
6.82 for India to a maximum of 16.92 In Bangladesh).&#13;

IV. THE PROSPECTS FOR ALLEVIATING MALNUTRITION&#13;
4.01      For the purposes of the projections attempted in this study, the&#13;
possible food policy scenarios can be categorized into four general types of&#13;
market interventions: (i) policies that through import or price constraints&#13;
maintain constant food prices, (ii) policies that allow food prices to rise&#13;
by some fixed amount, (iii) policies that allow food prices to rise to the&#13;
point of self-sufficiency and, (iv) policies that allow a fixed amount or&#13;
percentage of food imports and a consequential change in food prices. All&#13;
these market interventions can be combined to some degree among themselves&#13;
and with policies acting on variables other than prices such as, in particular,&#13;
income and food distribution programs.&#13;
Projections at Constant Prices&#13;
4.02      For all countries in the sample, projections at constant food&#13;
prices are based on rather unlikely assumptions and should be interpreted&#13;
only as ceteris paribus implications of the base year estimates. As Table 7&#13;
shows, for all countries except Bangladesh, the income increases implied by&#13;
the high growth hypothesis would reduce the nutritional problem to manageable&#13;
proportions by 1985 and nearly eliminate it by 1995. While a sizable number&#13;
of people below the FAO/WHO standard persist under the low growth hypothesis,&#13;
in all cases (but Bangladesh) the aggregate nutritional gap is such a small&#13;
portion of market demand, that a marginal redistribution of food would be&#13;
sufficient to wipe out the bulk of malnutrition within two decades.&#13;
4.03      Some of the trade-offs between income growth and redistribution&#13;
of growth are further ilustrated in Table 8. This table shows the aggregate&#13;
growth rates in per capita income necessary to bring the consumption of 95i&#13;
of the population above the calorie requirement under three alternative&#13;
income distribution scenarios:   (i) an "optimal" redistribution of income&#13;
(i.e. a redistribution of income such that the above target would be achieved&#13;
with minimum aggregate growth), (ii) a "drastic" redistribution of income&#13;
resulting in a Gini coefficient change of -252 and, (iii) income growth&#13;
without redistribution.&#13;
4.04      In the "optimal" redistribution scenario 1/, aggregate per capita&#13;
income growth needed to eliminate malnutrition by 1995 turns out to be only&#13;
in the 1 to 2% per annum range or within feasible ranges of growth for these&#13;
countries. While this scenario is an unlikely one, given the present&#13;
,-trucLure of ownership and political power, these low income rates point&#13;
!evertheless to the potentially powerful impact of drastic redistribution&#13;
measures on eliminating malnutrition even under low levels of aggregate&#13;
growth.&#13;
1/  In this scheme, each group is given just sufficient income growth to&#13;
meet the expenditure requirements to purchase the amount of food&#13;
necessary to fulfill the calorie requirement. The other groups al-&#13;
ready consuming adequate levels of calories are given a concessionary&#13;
per capita growth of 1% per annum.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-1 7-&#13;
4.05      The second scheme of income growth redistribution requires income&#13;
to be redistributed such that the Gini coefficient is reduced by 25% via a&#13;
transfer of growth between the highest income groups to the lowest. Such a&#13;
redistribution has also similar results to the optimum one for Sri Lanka,&#13;
Pakistan and Morocco. For India, Bangladesh and Indonesia, however, the&#13;
aggregate income growth necessary to achieve the nutritional targets would&#13;
nearly double from the optimum growth rates.&#13;
4.06      The first column in the table shows the aggregate growth rates&#13;
necessary to eliminate malnutrition if income redistribution does not occur.&#13;
For Pakistan and Sri Lanka again these growth rates are within feasible&#13;
ranges, but for the other countries they are beyond the levels that could be&#13;
expected in the next decade. The results thus indicate that, although income&#13;
growth may have the potential to eliminate much malnutrition, redistribution&#13;
of income would substantially economize on the necessary income growth.&#13;
Conversely, growth without redistribution may not only fail to eradicate&#13;
malnutrition, but due to the possible negative impact of food availability&#13;
on prices, may even make the nutritional problem more dramatic than it is&#13;
now.&#13;
EndoRenous Price Projections&#13;
4.07      In order to explore more systematically the interaction between&#13;
demand, supply, income levels and prices, this study uses a partial equili-&#13;
brium model consisting of (i) the estimated price-responsive demand equations,&#13;
(ii) a series of equations of trend growths of domestic production of food&#13;
and, (iii) a "band" of supply responses borrowed from country specific econo-&#13;
metric studies. Given these three elements, consumption and production&#13;
patterns are simulated for the case of low and high supply response and for&#13;
alternative food import (self sufficiency) targets.&#13;
4.08      The immediate conclusion from the results of these simulated alter-&#13;
native scenarios (Table 9) is that under a policy of constant food prices&#13;
malnutrition is often reduced only at the cost of unacceptably high food import&#13;
requirements. For example, if India succeeded in maintaining constant food&#13;
prices, the level of malnutrition would only be about 4% in 1995 compared to&#13;
11% under historical import levels. However, the import levels required&#13;
to attempt such a policy would be of the order of 54 million tons or about&#13;
20% of total consumption of the country. At a price of $200 per metric ton&#13;
of foodgrains, the foreign exchange cost alone would reach $10 billion. In&#13;
contrast, the comparison between self-sufficiency and historical import ratios&#13;
for India reveals that a policy of self-sufficiency would require about an&#13;
additional .7 million metric tons to be distributed through a food distribution&#13;
system compared to that required for historical import levels. Production&#13;
and prices would increase at approximately historical rates. The consequence&#13;
of a self-sufficiency food policy for India could then be likely to be a&#13;
higher burden on the food distribution system, but perhaps a better distribu-&#13;
tion of food and income in favor of the rural poor.&#13;

4.09      The consequences of self-sufficiency for Bangladesh are more harsh&#13;
than that for India. Eliminating imports into Bangladesh would increase the&#13;
rate of growth of food prices by about 1.12 per annum above the rate that would&#13;
occur with historical import levels. The nutritional gap would also increase&#13;
from about 5.1 to 7 million metric tons and malnutrition would continue to&#13;
persist at high levels. Similarly, for Sri Lanka eliminating imports would&#13;
substantially increase food prices and malnutrition. Although production would&#13;
grow at an additional 12 per annum, food prices would increase at 1.7Z per&#13;
annum and the level of malnutrition would reach nearly 50% of the households.&#13;
4.10      These results are not unexpected but they serve to quantify some of&#13;
the conflict between the desire of the developing countries to alleviate&#13;
malnutrition and their limited resources. Given the level of our estimates, a&#13;
policy of self-sufficiency - clearly a necessity from the point of view of&#13;
some country's resource constraints and scarcity of foreign exchange - would&#13;
likely make the nutritional problem intolerable. A compromise is needed in the&#13;
form of a movement toward higher food production with moderately increasing&#13;
prices, but even such a compromise is appropriate only if the country is&#13;
willing to absorb the additional burdens of a public food distribution system.&#13;

V. MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Patterns of Distribution and Responsiveness&#13;
5.01      The main findings of this study stem from the use of household&#13;
survey aggregate data to measure (i) the pattern of calorie distribution, (ii)&#13;
the extent of malnutrition, and (iii) the potential of the various income&#13;
groups for improving their nutritional status via a general or specific&#13;
increase in income. On these three accounts, despite the few data points&#13;
available, the study provides fresh empirical information and evidence as to&#13;
the conformity of the intra and inter-country consumption and response pat-&#13;
terns to the hypotheses of economic theory.&#13;
5.02      One of the major findings of the study Is that income and food&#13;
prices explain more than 90% of the variance of calorie intake both within&#13;
each country and across countries. Moreover the poor are more responsive in&#13;
their calorie consumption to income and price changes that had been previously&#13;
postulated or estimated. As a consequence, relatively high income growth&#13;
rates will significantly reduce inter-household malnutrition by 1995, provided&#13;
that income distribution does not deteriorate or that large rises in the price&#13;
of food do not occur. However, market simulations indicate that under histori-&#13;
cal import level relative food prices will increase by 1.0 to 2.0% per annum&#13;
for many developing countries, a fact that in addition to the prospects that&#13;
income distribution may deterioriate is likely to cause widespread malnutrition&#13;
by 1995.&#13;
Food Production&#13;
5.03      A second major conclusion of this study is that historical growth&#13;
rates in production, if they continue, will not be sufficient to provide the&#13;
necessary food supplies to meet market demand and to meet the nutritional&#13;
needs of the poor even if food prices are kept constant by government inter-&#13;
vention. As a consequence, the necessary condition for eliminating malnutrition&#13;
will not be fulfilled for many of the countries under historical growth rates&#13;
in production. Food production must increase in the range of 3 to 4% per year&#13;
in order to provide the necessary food supplies to meet market demand and&#13;
provide for direct distribution to alleviate malnutrition. If food supplies&#13;
either from production or imports are insufficient, prices of food will rise&#13;
with major nutritional consequences for the majority of the population that do&#13;
not gain in income from this price rise.&#13;
income Redistribution&#13;
5.04      Our findings also indicate that while major income redistributions&#13;
may have a dramatic impact on malnutrition, moderate levels of income redis-&#13;
tribution will only reduce the calorie deficits of the poor and hence decrease&#13;
the amount of time required for income growth to eliminate malnutrition. On&#13;
the other hand, a worsening of income distribution in accordance to present&#13;
trends will generally increase food needs and expand much beyond the next tw*&#13;
decades the time required for moderate levels of income growth to end&#13;
malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
Supplementary Food Programs&#13;
5.05      The study confirms that malnutrition is likely to be widespread and&#13;
severe in the developing countries studied, and that malnutrition will continue&#13;
to be a severe problem under projected income growth and food price increases.&#13;
As a consequence, food programs and market intervention will be necessary to&#13;
reduce the severity of malnutrition and to reach certain segments of the&#13;
malnourished population. Although the need for a food intervention program&#13;
will be significantly alleviated if high growth rates in income and food&#13;
production are achieved, realistic scenarios suggest the continuing need for&#13;
food programs at levels that will place severe burdens on government budgets&#13;
and management.&#13;

APPENDIX 1&#13;
Food and Nutritional Gaps: Definition and Properties&#13;
The definition of nutritional requirements by income group and their&#13;
comparison with demand and availability of nutrients gives rise to a number of&#13;
different measures of basic nutritional needs, real income, poverty lines and&#13;
gaps. In this appendix, mutually consistent definitions are adopted and their&#13;
measures are related to one another by accounting or behavioral relationships.&#13;
1.        Nutritional Requirement:   The required per capita intake of calories&#13;
necessary to satisfy social nutritional standards. This requirement is deter-&#13;
mined in part by age, sex and body weight using FAD/WHO methodology. Allowance&#13;
for individual variability and the uncertainty of the social standard is also&#13;
made.&#13;
2.        Poverty Line:   For the purpose of this study, the poverty line is&#13;
defined as the minimum income level at which existing expenditure patterns&#13;
would satisfy nutritional requirements.&#13;
3.        Malnourished Population:   The proportion of the total population con-&#13;
suming below the nutritional requirement.&#13;
4.        Nutritional Gap:   The difference between the actual nutritional intake&#13;
and the nutritional requirement of the malnourished population augmented by a&#13;
factor (about 1OZ) to take into account waste between retail and consumption&#13;
and supply variability.&#13;
5.        Total Food Needs in Grain Equivalents:   The amount of foodgrains that&#13;
would have to be made available to meet both the nutritional gap and the market&#13;
calorie demands of the total population.&#13;
6.        Domestic Supply Availability:   The amount of grain/food available from&#13;
domestic production and stocks.&#13;
7.        Domestic Food Gap:   Total food needs in grain equivalent minus domestic&#13;
supply availability.&#13;
8.        Domestic Market Gap:   Total food demand in grain equivalents minus&#13;
lomestic supply availability.&#13;
9.        Import Capacity:   Amounts of grain/food available from imports given&#13;
the country's foreign exchange earnings in a hypothetical development scenario.&#13;
10.       Total Food Gap:   Total food needs in grain equivalents minus domesti&#13;
supply availability and import capacity.&#13;
11.       Food Security:   Country's ability to meet its total food needs in&#13;
grain equivalent from domestic supply availability and its import capacity-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
Assuming for simplicity the waste factor to be zero, per capita nutri-&#13;
tional gap can be expressed algebraically for the h-th income group as follows:&#13;
Dh   rh    Ch                                           (1)&#13;
where rh is the per capita nutritional requirement and Ch is the actual per&#13;
capita calorie consumption for the h-th group. Assuming a semi-logarithmic&#13;
form for the calorie demand function yields:&#13;
(2)&#13;
Dh   rh    a - b log Yh&#13;
h  h           ~~~h&#13;
Three basic propositions relating income distribution, elasticities&#13;
and growth paramenters follow from this simple relationship and account for the&#13;
projections on which this study is based.&#13;
Proposition 1: The growth rate of the per capita nutritional gap for the h-th&#13;
income group is a linear function of the growth rate of the per capita income&#13;
growth rate for the group. Furthenmore, the coefficient is the ratio between&#13;
the calorie income elasticity and the per capita nutritional gap expressed as&#13;
a percent.&#13;
Proof: From expression (2). using the subscript t to denote time,&#13;
we have:&#13;
.Dht    Dht -ht-           b            h&#13;
log                  ht          D b-log      y -    )&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

where gc is the growth rate of the per capita nutritional gap, gy the growth&#13;
rate of per capita income and:&#13;
*      _____b              Cht-l&#13;
nht-1 ' Dht-1    ht-l     rh - cht-l&#13;
Proposition 2: The time required to close the nutritional gap for&#13;
the h-th group is equal to the ratio of the percentage per capita nutritional&#13;
gap to the product of the calorie income elasticity with the per capita income&#13;
rate of growth. Thus, a 100% increase in the elasticity or in the growth&#13;
rate results in a 100% reduction in the time required to close the Nutritional&#13;
Gap.&#13;
Proof: Assuming exponential growth at rate gy implies:&#13;
Dht   rh   a - b log Y   egy                                (5)&#13;
where YO is per capita income in the base period.   Setting D   equal to zero&#13;
in (5) and solving for t yields:&#13;
rh   1)&#13;
t -  1  [rh  a - b  log  0 o  g  b   h   Dhr      nho gh      n*  g        (6)&#13;
Proposition 3: The distribution of the nutritional gap is less&#13;
unequal than the distribution of the corresponding income gap. For the simple&#13;
case of a Pareto income law, the Gini coefficient of the calorie distribution&#13;
is a function of the product between the calorie income elasticity and the&#13;
Gini coefficient.&#13;
Proof: If the per capita income distribution follows a Pareto law&#13;
v does the per capita calorie intake. The Pareto representation of per&#13;
3pita income is:&#13;

APPENDIX 2&#13;
The Prolection Methodology&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1. Estimation of Calorie Requirements.&#13;
The average calorie requirements for a population is a function of its&#13;
activity level, its average body weight by sex, and its age and sex&#13;
distributions. Applying FAO/WHO conversion factors by various age&#13;
groups for moderate levels of activity to projected population, age and&#13;
sex distributions, the calorie requirements are determined for the&#13;
base year, 1985 and 1995. The required calorie intake for children&#13;
(those below 12 years old) is based on the ideal body weight, which&#13;
would result from proper nutrition and food intake, and not on the&#13;
actual body weights. Adults weights are taken from actual measurement&#13;
of body weights and do not assume the ideal weight as is the case with&#13;
children.&#13;
2.  Conversion of Household Consumption and Exenditure Data into Calorie&#13;
Consumption by Food Item.&#13;
Household consumption and expenditure surveys usually contain the&#13;
expenditure on food items and the quantities of these food items&#13;
consumed by income or expenditure groups. FAO conversion tables for&#13;
the country or region were used to convert these quantities to calories.&#13;
For Indonesia, the household consumption survey gave only expenditures&#13;
and not quantities for outside food purchases. The quantities were&#13;
estimated using an average calorie price that was proportional to the&#13;
in-household consumed food's calorie price by expenditure class. The&#13;
factor of proportionality was derived to make the calorie estimate&#13;
from the consumption survey equal to the calorie availability from the&#13;
FAO Food Balances.&#13;
B. Estimation of the Calorie-income or Expenditure Function&#13;
From the household consumption and expenditure surveys, calorie&#13;
consumption per capita by income or expenditure class is derived. Since the&#13;
surveys use different sampling techniques and draw different sample sizes for&#13;
different income groups, the variance of the error term in the calorie consum-&#13;
ption function differs by the income class. This phenomenon is referred to as&#13;
heteroscedasticity and requires special estimation techniques.&#13;
The function to be estimated derived from (2) is:&#13;
Ci = a + b log Yi +   i                                     (12)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
where: Ci is the average calorie consumption per capita of the&#13;
income class with average income or expenditure per capita Y1 and t&#13;
2&#13;
is the random error term having variance ail and mean p - 0.&#13;
The elasticity of calorie consumption with respect to income is:&#13;
e     a C /C    b&#13;
ec   a Y/ Y       c                                               (13)&#13;
Note that this elasticity decreases with increasing calorie consum-&#13;
ption levels. To maintain the variance of the error term constant&#13;
for all income classes, each obseration is weighted by /Pi     where p&#13;
is the porportion of the sample in the i th income class. Equation&#13;
(12) becomes:&#13;
pcI = -i       a + bi     log YI + /p    Cl                       (14)&#13;
C. The Calorie Consumption Function with the Price Effect Included&#13;
The price term introduces an income effect of price changes. (See&#13;
Appendix I for the derivation of the demand function.) The calorie con-&#13;
sumption function with the price term derived from (8) is:&#13;
Cit - a + b log Yit - m(Yit) b log Pjt + cit                       (15)&#13;
where:  m(Yit) is the budget share expenditure on commodity&#13;
J and Pjt is the price of commodity j In year t&#13;
(for simplicity, the effect of the other commodities&#13;
in the price term is ignored).&#13;
Defining a' as:&#13;
a' - a - m b  log Pl                                              (16)&#13;
and substituting it into (15) yields:&#13;
Cit - a' + b log Y'i  - m(Y t) b log   P                          (l&#13;
Thts equation is the basic relationship used for the projection ezerclse.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

D. The Methodology of the ProJections&#13;
I. The Basic Equation&#13;
The function m(Yi) is estimated for food using a log-log relationship&#13;
and weighting the variables by the sampling proportion    P   . The function&#13;
log Ei   d + f log Yi + vi&#13;
where EC is the expenditure on food, is fitted using a weighted&#13;
I&#13;
regression. The estimated budget share, in time period t,&#13;
for the i th class is:&#13;
m (Yit    Ec (Ylt   /yl                                      (19)&#13;
where Eci is the fitted value from (18).&#13;
i&#13;
2. Pro1ections with Pfice Effects&#13;
For the case where prices do not change (Pjt - Pjo for all t)&#13;
the calorie consumption of income class i in year t is:&#13;
C   D a' + b log (1 + gi)   yl                               (20)&#13;
where gi is the income growth rate of income class I.&#13;
For the case with price changes, P1t - XP     where X is&#13;
jt  ~Jo&#13;
the proportion of the price change, the calorie consumption of&#13;
income class I in year t is:&#13;
cit - a' + b log [(l + g)    yio- - m (Yit) b log X               (21)&#13;
For any particular growth rate of income and a given price change,&#13;
the calorie consumption of the i th income class is determined&#13;
in year t by equation (21).&#13;
3. Changes in Income Distribution&#13;
One index of income distribution is the Gini Coefficient. This&#13;
Index represents the area between the diagonal of a Lorenz diagram and the&#13;
Lorenz curve as a fraction of the total area below the diagonal. The index&#13;
varies from zero, s1pwing absolute equal income distribution, to one, showing&#13;
absolute inequality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
For this study, the Lorenz curve is assumed to be approximated by&#13;
the basic formula of Pareto which relates the number of persons with&#13;
income above or equal to a level Y.&#13;
-b&#13;
n - A' Y    subject to the restraint&#13;
b &gt; 1/2  and Y &gt; Yo                                          (22)&#13;
where Y0 is the minimum income.&#13;
The Gini Coefficient for the Lorenz curve is:&#13;
G - 1/(2b-1)                                               (23)&#13;
Lorenz curves have been estimated from the income or expenditure distribution&#13;
as given in household budget surveys. From this estimate, the base year Gini&#13;
coefficient is derived. For the years of the projections the Gini coefficient&#13;
is varied by t25% so that each income class has a different growth rate in&#13;
income. The criteria for the allocation of growth rates to achieve a more&#13;
equal income distribution (a decreasing Gini coefficient) produces the highest&#13;
growth rates for the poorest groups while giving the lowest growth rates to&#13;
the richest groups; for a more unequal income distribution (increasing Gini&#13;
coefficient), the richest groups have the higher income growth. The deriva-&#13;
tion of the growth rates for each income class is as follows: Consider the&#13;
Pareto curve for the base year:&#13;
n - A' Y-b                                                 (24)&#13;

For self-sufficiency, the price changq Xt, that equates aggregate&#13;
demand (equation (34)) with aggregate production (equation (35)) is found.&#13;
For other levels of imports, aggregate production plus imports is equated to&#13;
ggregate demand.    The effect of this price change on calorie intake of each&#13;
income class and levels of malnourishment are determined using equation (31).&#13;

Bangladesh: Country Summary&#13;
Data Base&#13;
i.        The base year input data used in this case study was taken from the&#13;
1973/74 Houehold Budget Survey which presents the average quantity of food&#13;
consumed per month by expenditure class. 1/ These food quantities were&#13;
converted into calories using tables on nutrient values prepared by the&#13;
Indian Council of Medical Research. Because the calorie intake levels for the&#13;
two lowest expenditure clases were unreasonably low (495 and 871 calories),&#13;
they were aggregated with the third class by taking a weighted average.&#13;
(Table 4.1). Both classes combined accounted for approximately 1% of the&#13;
population. The remaining data required for the regressions and the calcula-&#13;
tion of income inequality (Gini coefficient) were also taken from the 1973/74&#13;
survey. Average daily calorie requirements for the base year 1973/74 (2,020),&#13;
1985 (2,033) and 1995 (2,041) were calculated using FAO/WHO standards'less 200&#13;
calories and assumed body weights of 50 Kg and 45 Kg for males and females&#13;
respectively. (Table 4.2)&#13;
ii.       Extensive documentation on the survey design was not available at the&#13;
time this study was completed. To check the plausibility of the derived&#13;
calorie intakes the average intake implied by the expenditure data was compared&#13;
to per capita availability of food in 1973/74 and to the findings of the&#13;
1975/76 Nutrition Survey. The derived calorie intakes compare closely with&#13;
FAO per capita availability estimates (1,933 versus 1,971), and are only&#13;
slightly lower than the results derived from the 1975/76 Nutrition Survey. The&#13;
discrepancy can for the most part be explained by the higher per capita consump-&#13;
tion of cereals estimated by the 1975/76 Survey (18 oz./day - 1,784 cal/day).&#13;
Although it could be asserted that 1975/76 was a "good" year, this hypothesis is&#13;
not supported by a comparison of estimates of foodgrain availablity between&#13;
1973/74 (15.9 oz./day - 1,576 cal/day) and 1975/76 (15.6 oz./day = 1,545&#13;
cal/day). Assuming that the Nutrition Survey data provide a more accurate&#13;
measure of calorie malnutrition, the figure used in this study for the base&#13;
year would, on average, tend to overstate the percent malnourished in 1985 and&#13;
1995 by 17 points. This would be equivalent to a reduction in the calorie&#13;
requirement or an upward adjustment in intakes by 190 calorie/capita/day.&#13;
However, there is no information available at this time which would indicate&#13;
which of the two is more correct.&#13;

INDIA: Country Summary&#13;
Data Base&#13;
Data for India were derived from the 28th Round of the National&#13;
Sample Survey (NSS). The Survey was conducted between October 1973 and June&#13;
1974 over the whole of India. Household expenditures for non-productive&#13;
domestic consumption were collected for the period of 30 days preceding the&#13;
Survey. The distribution of villages/blocks for the rural/urbai samples was&#13;
determined on the basis of population so that the sample is self-weighted&#13;
within the rural and urban sectors. The observations were on the household&#13;
level defined as a group of people normally living and eating together.&#13;
There were 15,467 rural and 7,881 urban households in the sample.&#13;
The Indian government compiled the data into summary tables of&#13;
average quantitites and expenditures for commodity groups by expenditure&#13;
class. The amount of cereals consumed (derived from the summary tables)&#13;
was directly converted to calories. In order to estimate total average calorie&#13;
consumption, the cereal calories were increased by a proportion determined for&#13;
each expenditure class - urban and rural. The proportion was derivfd from the&#13;
1971-72 NSS which has been converted entirely to calories by the FAO. it was&#13;
based on the assumption that if (for example) cereal calories were 807 of totae&#13;
calories in 1971-72, they would still be that percentage in 1973-74.&#13;
Since the urban area was over-sampled on the basis of accual national&#13;
population, the aggregation of rural and urban intakes by expenditure class&#13;
was weighted by the true population percentages. The summary tables included&#13;
an average total expenditure figure for each expenditure class. These were&#13;
similarly aggregated to arrive at the national total expenditures utilized in&#13;
the statistical analysis.&#13;
The distribution of the population by classes of calorie consumption&#13;
was obtained using the data of the 1971-72 NSS. Unlike the 1973-74 Survey,&#13;
the 1971-72 NSS contains tabulations of calorie intake by consumption class.&#13;
The same distribution was also estimated with the data from the 26th NSS using&#13;
the distribution of households by expenditure class and their average per&#13;
capita calorie consumption. No significant difference emerges from these two&#13;
alternative calculations.&#13;

INDONESIA: Country Summary&#13;
i         Data on food expenditures (quantities) by income class as taken from&#13;
the Fifth National Socio-Economic Survey, Susenas V, provided the base year&#13;
input data for these projections. The survey itself was conducted in three&#13;
rounds (January-April, Hay-August and September-December) and covered approxi-&#13;
mately 54,000 households (18,000 per round) which is equivalent to approximately&#13;
.25 million people. The data used in this study was disaggregated into 13&#13;
expenditure classes and included over 40 major foodstuffs from each of three&#13;
sources: purchases, home production and gifts. Since the data was in terms of&#13;
quantities, each food item was converted into its calorie equivalent so that a&#13;
calorie expenditure elasticity relationship could be estimated. However, two&#13;
adjustments of the data were made prior to estimation.&#13;
ii        For five food categories: vegetables, legumes, fruits, miscellaneous&#13;
foodstuffs (incluOing sugar and oils) and the total prepared food category,&#13;
expenditures rather than quantities were listed. Excluding these five cate-&#13;
gories would have resulted in a national average per capita calorie intake&#13;
significantly below that listed in FAO Food Balance Sheet (2031 versus 1767).&#13;
To correct for this discrepancy a cost per calorie specific to each expenditure&#13;
class was derived and used to convert the five food group expenditures into&#13;
their respective calorie equivalents. The second adjustment made prior to&#13;
*stimation of the calorie expenditure equation 'was the aggregation of the two&#13;
lowest expenditure classes and of two middle expenditure classes leaving 10&#13;
classes altogether. This was done because calorie intake of the lowest class&#13;
was unreasonably low (737) while that of the 8th class was unreasonably high&#13;
(3922) relative to surrounding classes (2266 and 2657).&#13;

MOROCCO: Country Summary&#13;
Data Base&#13;
The 1970-71 Household Budget Survey was used to provide lase year&#13;
information for the Morocco food projections. The Survey design was a stratifLad&#13;
sample selected from six urban strata and five rural strata based on 1960&#13;
census sampling frame. The sample included 6,309 households of which the&#13;
2,960 were from urban areas and 3,349 from rural areas. Each household was&#13;
studied for one week period between April 1970 and April 1971. Tn determining&#13;
daily food or calorie intake of household, the portion of household own&#13;
production retained for self-consumption was evaluated at local market prices.&#13;
The surveys also noted the quantity and price of the daily purchases.&#13;
Only Volume I and Volume IV of the Survey report were rpublished at&#13;
the time this study was completed. The former includes a national summary of&#13;
the results while the latter provides a more detailed nutrititnai inforubation&#13;
by expenditure class and urban and rural households.    It also contains a/crage&#13;
consumption of food categories by occupational status, region and type of urban&#13;
dwelling. Since these additional information are not income class spec'fic,&#13;
they are not utilized in our projection analysis.&#13;
Weighting WHO/FAO calorie requirements (or recommended) level by&#13;
population age structure less 200 calories yields a calorie reference level of&#13;
2,276 per capita. Relative to this reference level 42% of the population had&#13;
inadequate calorie intakes. Thus, national nutritional gap amounted to 0.50&#13;
million metric tons annually.&#13;

PAKISTAN: Country Summary&#13;
Data Base&#13;
The Household Income and Expenditure Survey, which was the data base&#13;
of this study, was conducted by the GOP's Ministry of Finance, Planning and&#13;
Development over four quarters from July 1971 to June 1972 in both the rural&#13;
and urban areas. An independent sample was selected in each quarter. For&#13;
the country as a whole, the total sample was 7,294 households disaggregated&#13;
into 13 income classes. Data was collected by direct interview.&#13;
For this study, the 13 income classes presented by the Survey are&#13;
aggregated into 10 classes in order to smooth the calorie consumption data.&#13;
The recommended daily per capita calorie intake level - a measure of adequacy&#13;
of calorie consumption - was determined according to FAO/WHO guidelines (2,258&#13;
calories) less 200 calories. Because of projected changes in the age distri-&#13;
bution of the population, the minimum recommended calorie intake is expected&#13;
to be 2,080 and 2,090 for 1985 and 1995, respectively (Table 2).&#13;

SRI LANKA: Country Summary&#13;
Data Base&#13;
The study of the food and nutritional levels of the communiity is&#13;
based on the food consumption data collected during the Socio-Eccnomi- Survey&#13;
of 1969/70, 1/ which was conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics in&#13;
four consecutive rounds, each of three months duration, from November 1969 to&#13;
October 1970. The Survey was not designed as a formal food consumption survey&#13;
but the Special Report on Food and Nutritional Levels was possible due to the&#13;
high quality of the data collected.&#13;
The sampling method used was two-stage stratification, with enumer-&#13;
ation areas (Population Census Blocks with about 100 households each) as first&#13;
stage units and households as second-stage units. The results were presented&#13;
for the country as a whole as well as for the three sectors - urban, rural and&#13;
estate. The total number of households surveyed for all four rounds was&#13;
9,694 or approximately 0.5% of the estimated number of households in Sri&#13;
Lanka. The method of data collection on household expenditure was by "Inter-&#13;
viewing with a Recall List", but for Food, Drink and Toabcco items this was&#13;
combined with a more intensive "Accounting Method" with the Investigator&#13;
making daily visits to record the selected food items consumed during the&#13;
period of seven consecutive days. One member of each household was also asked&#13;
to maintain a daily diary on food consumption. 2/&#13;

2/ The household income reported reflects auto-consumption valued at&#13;
prevailing prices and added as an income item. However, reported&#13;
income does not reflect the one measure of free rice available&#13;
weekly per person on the ration at the time of the survey.&#13;

            Nutrition and food needs in developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study presents an assessment of the
            problem of food supply and distribution in selected
            developing countries. Using fresh empirical evidence from
            household budget surveys, aggregate food supply and income
            distribution, two main conclusions are reached. First, the
            pattern of calorie consumption appears to be rather similar
            in the sample of countries considered, once variations of
            income and prices are taken into account. Second, if food
            prices increase and/or income distribution deteriorates in
            accordance with past trends, increases in aggregate supplies
            of food would be insufficient to eliminate malnutrition in
            the next two decades. Therefore, food programs and market
            interventions will be necessary to reduce the severity of
            malnutrition and to reach certain segments of the
            malnourished population.
