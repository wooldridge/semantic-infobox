            strategies : a more popular option ?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In some countries, privatization has
            stalled because of a popular perception that it benefits
            only the rich and powerful or only foreigners. The author
            looks at how governments can achieve more widespread public
            ownership and therefore boost political support for
            privatization. He focuses on voucher schemes, collective
            investment programs, and public offerings.
