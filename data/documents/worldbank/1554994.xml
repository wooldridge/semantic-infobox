Policy Interventions for Technological Innovation-.: '&#13;
in Developing Countries&#13;
This paper assesses the potential social payoff of alternative measures&#13;
that might be taken to promote innovation in developing countries. It is&#13;
mainly concerned with the general issues of encouraging technical innovaticn&#13;
in the nonagricultural sectors. As far as possible, however, it also is&#13;
focused on the more particular but important question of how to generate&#13;
"appropriate" innovations:   that is, innovations that lead to new techniques&#13;
of production which are better suited than existing ones to the social&#13;
objectives of employment and greater equality in the distribution of&#13;
income. The word "innovation" is used in an especially wide sense in this&#13;
paper.&#13;
Part 1 discusses the process of innovation and describes the skills associated&#13;
with it. Part 2 sets forth some of the special problems that developing&#13;
economies encounter in building up innovative skills. The first section&#13;
suggests that the ready supply of foreign technology leads to underdevelop-&#13;
ment and underuse of innovative skills, particularly in the modern indus-&#13;
trial sector. The second describes some of the important consequences of&#13;
such underuse.&#13;
Part 3 draws together some of the main implications for policy and explains&#13;
how priorities for the development of local innovative activities might be&#13;
determined. The approach is qualitative and descriptive, but' the objective&#13;
is to work out areas in which comparative social costs are likely to be in&#13;
favor of building up local innovative capacity rather than relying solely&#13;
on foreign technology. Part 4 analyzes the patterns of innovative activity&#13;
that might be needed in developing economies-distinguishing between the&#13;
modern formal sector and the informal sector, 'and between large and small&#13;
enterprises in the formal sector. The analysis emphasizes the potential&#13;
importance of local machine making in innovation in industries that mainly&#13;
use mechanical technologies as opposed to chemical, electrical, or electro-&#13;
nic technologies. Part 5 summarizes the main conclusions and suggests some&#13;
of the implications of adopting an approach that stems from these conclusions&#13;
--in different national circumstances.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
Technological innovation in industry has been defined in various ways (Freeman&#13;
1975). In this paper it has an unusually wide meaning. Innovation includes&#13;
the introduction of a process or product that is new to the economy of a&#13;
particular developing country, regardless of whether it has been used before&#13;
elsewhere. It also includes all modifications or adaptations of processes or&#13;
products that are new to the economy-however minor they may be.     Innovative&#13;
activities therefore include:&#13;
* Search activities to determine the range of available processes and&#13;
product variants and selections from the range.&#13;
* Major and minor adaptations of production techniques and products.&#13;
* Development of new techniques and products.&#13;
The concept of innovation is nevertheless restricted in the sense that it&#13;
refers only to the introduction of the new or modified process or product.&#13;
Subsequent investments in the innovation will be regarded as a part of&#13;
diffusion.&#13;
Innovation under this definition, obviously is a wider concept than&#13;
"technical change," as it is usually thought of by economists. Technical&#13;
change normally refers to the appearance of new processes that are superior&#13;
to some or all existing processes-that is, it refers to a shift of the pro-&#13;
duction function. Here the concept of innovation covers the creation of&#13;

was written in 1976, but the issues discussed and the conclusions reached&#13;
are as alive today as they were then. The findings of more recent&#13;
studies serve only to confirm the line of argument presented here. Bruce&#13;
Ross-Larson edited the manuscript for publication as a working paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

superior techniques of production--but it also includes, for example, the&#13;
choice and introduction of an existing technique from abroad and the crea-&#13;
tion of new or modified techniques that may not be formally superior to&#13;
those which already exist, but that merely use different factor combinations.&#13;
The reason for departing from the conventional distinction between&#13;
factor-substitution choice of techniques and technical change is simple:&#13;
that distinction is not helpful or meaningful for our purposes. (Nelson&#13;
1972; Westphal 1974). First, the choice of techniques from an existing&#13;
range requires technical skills and other resources; it also incurs costs,&#13;
particularly costs of acquiring and understanding technical information.&#13;
It may require similar kinds of resources and have costs commensurate with&#13;
some kinds of technical change, such as minor modifications to existing&#13;
equipment. Second, the creation of new techniques that are factor-&#13;
substituting in relation to existing ones usually requires the same kind of&#13;
technical skills and resource costs as the creation of new superior tech-&#13;
niques. Consequently, the conventional distinctions are not particularly&#13;
relevant from the standpoint of innovation policy. A concept of innovation&#13;
that includes a spectrum of activities--from relatively low-cost search&#13;
activities to high-cost R &amp; D and the creation of new techniques--is more&#13;
useful from an operational point of view.&#13;
1. THE PROCESS OF INNOVATION&#13;
In some discussions, there is an implicit assumption that innovation,&#13;
especially innovation that results in new processes and products, is a linear&#13;
process. The linear process is presumed to start in a scientific laboratory,&#13;
possibly in a basic scientific discovery, and then go through stages: applied&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
research, experimental development, initial commercial application, improve-&#13;
ment, and so on. Even though this view of innovation is in plain contradic-&#13;
tion with such historical facts as the development of textile machinery early&#13;
in the Industrial Revolution, its influence has been fairly pervasive. The&#13;
view accounts in part for the excessive faith placed in R &amp; D institutes as a&#13;
source of innovation in developing countries.&#13;
Such a simplification is more misleading than useful. It is more&#13;
realistic to look upon innovation as a nonlinear affair involving a range&#13;
of specialist skills and capable of initiation at various points. Essen-&#13;
tially, innovation involves its own division of labor between, say, scientific&#13;
laboratories, engineering designers, machine fabricators, machine operators,&#13;
maintenance engineers, and so on.   Ideas and actions can be initiated at&#13;
any point in this division of labor, though the relative importance of dif-&#13;
ferent specializations probably is different between industries.&#13;
A categorization of the division of labor in innovation might include:&#13;
* Basic and applied research activity&#13;
* Experimental development&#13;
e Engineering design and adaptation&#13;
* Fabrication of machinery and production systems&#13;
* Installation and construction of plant&#13;
o Maintenance and repair engineering&#13;
o Plant operation&#13;
There are a number of points to be made about these categories, some of which&#13;
have definitions that are agreed upon internationally. First, not all innova-&#13;
tion calls on all these specialized skills. Some may never involve basic&#13;
or applied research, but be straightforward applications of a principle&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
by trial and error. The trial and error may take the form of changes&#13;
in the design and fabrication of machinery, rather than formal experimental&#13;
development. Many innovations for textile machinery evolved in this&#13;
way-indeed, so did those for the steam engine (though in this case there&#13;
was a more or less formal process of experimental development, too). In&#13;
contrast, some modern textile machinery involving complex aerodynamic&#13;
systems required laboratory research on a large scale. Clearly, the more&#13;
straightforward search and selection activities included in the definition&#13;
of innovation involve only a part of the system defined by these categories.&#13;
Second, regardless of the specializations called into play, innova-&#13;
tion can be initiated at any point in the system. Adam Smith was the first to&#13;
observe the multiplicity of sources of innovation.&#13;
Third, it is difficult to generalize about the order in which these&#13;
various categories of skills enter the process. Sometimes, an idea may be&#13;
developed by a machinery producer; after a while, problems may arise that&#13;
require the attention of a laboratory researcher. There may even be basic&#13;
scientific problems to solve. After the excursion into scientific examina-&#13;
tion, the machinery maker may once again enter the process, possibly through&#13;
a process of experimental development.&#13;
Fourth, the division of labor in innovation has evolved historically.&#13;
Of the early innovations in textiles, for example, it is rather difficult&#13;
to isolate the specialization of technical functions: for one thing the&#13;
innovators often were broadly skilled artisans, who cannot easily be fitted&#13;
into modern categories. Later, machine making became a differentiated sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
in the economy and the various engineering specializations began to emerge. 1/&#13;
Later still, formal R &amp; D laboratories were set up in firms, particularly&#13;
in the chemical and electrical industries (Bernal 1970) But the degree of&#13;
specialization of function today is by no means uniform for industries in&#13;
the advanced countries; the relative importance of different areas of special-&#13;
ization differs, too.&#13;
Some of the differences in the relative importance of specializa-&#13;
tions will be drawn on later in a discussion of possible patterns of innova-&#13;
tive activity in developing countries.&#13;
2. SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF INNOVATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
A number of arguments have been put forward to support the view that market&#13;
forces alone are generally unlikely to produce a socially optimal allocation&#13;
of resources to innovative activity. 2/ Some of these are based on the idea&#13;
that the planning horizon of the individual firm is shorter than is desirable&#13;
from a social point of view. Firms consequently put too much emphasis on&#13;
relatively minor product changes at the expense of more fundamental technologi-&#13;
cal innovations in process technology. 3/ Other arguments center on the&#13;
economies of scale in R &amp; D, which favor larger firms, or on the ease of&#13;
imitation, which negatively affects smaller innovative firms.&#13;
1/   Marx put particular emphasis on the differentiation of machine making,&#13;
and on the later development of machines to make machines, in the&#13;
creation of links between science and production (Marx 1961 [18671,&#13;
ch. 14).&#13;
2/   There is a summary of these in Westphal (1975).  See particularly Nelson,&#13;
Peck, and Kalachek (1967).&#13;
3/   This tendency is probably enhanced in differentiated oligopoly. Note&#13;
however, that the whole question of "optimality" in innovation investment&#13;
is more complex in oligopolistic systems, whether differentiated or not.&#13;
See Cooper (1973).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
These arguments are as valid for the developing economies as&#13;
for the advanced. In the developing countries, however, they are over-&#13;
shadowed by another consideration: the predominant role of foreign techno-&#13;
logy in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy, and the ease with which&#13;
'it can substitute for local innovative activity. All the skills involved&#13;
in innovation can be supplied in one way or another from outside of the&#13;
economy: local R &amp; D can be substituted by importing product and process&#13;
technology under license; design and construction of plant and equipment&#13;
can be contracted to foreign engineering firms rather than local ones; even&#13;
technical search activities can be, and often are, contracted abroad to&#13;
foreign consultants. What are the implication of this ready access to&#13;
foreign technology?&#13;
Problems in Developing Local Innovative Skills&#13;
Innovative skills are usually transferred from the advanced eco-&#13;
nomies when private or public enterprises in developing countries make&#13;
investments in new plant and equipment or in public utilities or new construc-&#13;
tion works. The transfer of technology occurs through a number of rather&#13;
complex transactions, sometimes involving long-term recurrent payments--for&#13;
example, if the transaction involves a license agreement or a grant of equity&#13;
to the foreign supplier. The use of foreign technical skills in this way is&#13;
not damaging or disadvantageous in itself. In fact, various people have seen&#13;
the use of advanced-country technology as an important way of reducing the&#13;
resources developing countries need to invest in the creation of scientific&#13;
and technical manpower.&#13;
The problem, however, is that even under competitive market condi-&#13;
tions, the use of foreign sources of technology and foreign technical skills&#13;
--rather than building up local skills and technical institutions--is likely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
to go further than is desirable from a social point of view. In short, it is&#13;
likely to produce a socially undesirable underdevelopment of the innovative&#13;
capability of developing countries.&#13;
There are two main reasons this is likely to happen. Both result&#13;
from the fact that most of the technical skills needed in innovation depend&#13;
on learning-by-doing in the local economy.&#13;
The first reason is that the gains from local learning-by-doing in&#13;
most cases are not captured by the investing enterprises in the developing&#13;
economies. From their standpoint the gains are external economies. This&#13;
point about technical learning as an external economy can be illustrated&#13;
by a simple hypothetical example.    Suppose that a firm in a developing&#13;
country is about to invest in a new production line and that to carry out the&#13;
investment phase it has a choice between using a local company for engineering&#13;
design and construction or a foreign one. The local engineers have compara-&#13;
tively little experience. As far as the local investor is concerned, there&#13;
are risks in contracting design and construction to them.   They may produce&#13;
a poor design, or they may be inefficient, thus extending the period of&#13;
construction and incurring unanticipated construction costs. Consequently,&#13;
the greater experience and longer track record of the foreign engineers will&#13;
put them in a strong competitive position.&#13;
From a social point of view, there would be advantages if the&#13;
local engineers were used. They would acquire experience and their efficiency&#13;
would improve. In fact, learning-by-doing is a critically important source&#13;
of experience and increased efficiency in design and construction work:&#13;
there really is no other way for them to improve their competitiveness. So&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
there would be social gains, as well as gains to the local engineers, if the&#13;
local investor employed them. But these gains do not enter the calculus of&#13;
the private investor, who would not benefit from the improved efficiency of&#13;
the local engineers, except possibly by employing them in the future--and&#13;
even then the benefits would be only partial. The investing company would&#13;
simply be meeting the costs of having the local engineers acquire experience.&#13;
The second reason that market forces are likely to lead to under-&#13;
investment in local innovative skills is that the learning process is long.&#13;
If the firm's planning horizon is shorter than is socially desirable--or the&#13;
social rate of discount is lower than the market rate--the result will be&#13;
underinvestment. To extend the foregoing example: if the local engineering&#13;
company had a sufficiently long time horizon, it might decide to compete&#13;
against foreign competitors by offering low prices and extensive guarantees.&#13;
Doing this would involve heavy losses in the short run, but as the firm gained&#13;
experience through learning-by-doing, it would eventually be able to compete&#13;
profitably on an equal footing.&#13;
There are obvious problems with this: for example, it is probable&#13;
that few engineering firms in developing countries would be in a strong enough&#13;
financial position to honor the guarantees they might have to offer. In&#13;
addition, the local engineering enterprise would incur losses for a long time&#13;
even if it completed its initial contracts with reasonable efficiency. If the&#13;
local engineering firm discounts the future at a higher rate than is consi-&#13;
dered appropriate for the society as a whole, the result would be more substi-&#13;
tution of local skills by foreign than is desirable on social grounds.&#13;
In the real world these problems are reinforced by other conditions,&#13;
which can be broadly described as imperfections in international markets in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
technology and technical skills. For example, foreign suppliers of technology&#13;
under license have incentives to control design and construction operations,&#13;
especially if they have underused capacity for engineering design in their own&#13;
firms, or if they wish to ensure that the quality of the product will match up&#13;
to their trademark requirements. In addition, strategic needs for control&#13;
over licensees or joint ventures can lead foreign suppliers of technology&#13;
effectively to exclude local technical skills (Cooper and Sercovitch 1971).&#13;
Even if the actual technology of production is more or less&#13;
"unmonopolized"--so that license agreements and the like can be avoided--&#13;
there are obstacles to the use and development of local technical personnel.&#13;
For example, machinery suppliers sometimes have strong incentives to supply&#13;
complete production systems, keeping full control of all design operations,&#13;
rather than supplying individual components of the production line. This&#13;
situation also arises in sectors in which machinery sales are mainly&#13;
handled through contractors    (Cooper and Maxwell 1975).    These problems&#13;
are discussed in more detail later on.&#13;
So far, the discussion has been based mostly on skills in engineer-&#13;
ing design and construction. But precisely the same kind of argument&#13;
applies to each of the other skill categories associated with the division&#13;
of labor in innovation discussed earlier.&#13;
Some Consequences of the Underuse of Local Innovative Skills&#13;
A number of consequences may follow from tendencies toward sub-&#13;
optimal use of local skills. First and perhaps most frequently, certain&#13;
capabilities simply may not be built up sufficiently. A good example is&#13;
the virtual absence of any skills for experimental development in the modern&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
industrial sectors of the developing countries. Even in countries under-&#13;
taking a considerable amount of industrial research, such as India or the&#13;
Latin American countries, there is little capacity for experimental develop-&#13;
ment of new technologies to the point where they are commercially useful.&#13;
Second, even if governments directly intervene to create certain&#13;
types of skill--say, in R &amp; D--these skills tend to remain underused. For&#13;
example, Subramanhiam (1972) has quoted a number of instances in which Indian&#13;
research laboratories have been able to create new industrial technologies,&#13;
but Indian private enterprises have preferred to license similar but more&#13;
thoroughly proven processes from abroad. It is not certain, of course, that&#13;
the private decisions described by Subramanhiam were always contrary to&#13;
social interests--but in some cases at least, it is likely that they were.&#13;
Another example comes from Argentina, where local manufacturers of plastics&#13;
machinery have argued that they are prevented from supplying certain types&#13;
of equipment--which they have developed locally and are able to produce&#13;
competitively--because local plastics fabricators have all-embracing license&#13;
agreements with foreign process suppliers. In some cases the license agree-&#13;
ments are mainly to obtain the right to use brand-names (Cooper and Maxwell&#13;
1975).&#13;
Third, the biases against the use of local technical capabilities&#13;
in industry, among some other factors, are also held responsible for the&#13;
phenomenon referred to (unhappily) as the "marginalization" of science and&#13;
technology in developing countries. This concept has played a considerable&#13;
part in explanations of the apparent ineffectiveness of science and technology&#13;
institutions in developing countries in producing relevant innovations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
The problem is alternately seen as an incapacity to apply relevant research&#13;
or as an unwillingness to do relevant research. Both those dimensions are&#13;
brought together in a set of explanations that focus on the "alienation of&#13;
science and technology from production" (Herrera 1973).&#13;
The starting point is the observation that social and economic&#13;
factors in the developing countries generally do not produce much demand&#13;
for local science and technology. Formal-sector technology, as already&#13;
argued, is mainly imported from advanced countries. The informal sector&#13;
may be innovative, but within narrow limits that do not produce a require-&#13;
ment for formal skills of scientists and engineers. Resource deprivation&#13;
in the agricultural sector, because of development strategies biased against&#13;
it, reduces the possibilities of technological advance; such institutional&#13;
factors as land tenure systems and landholding patterns c4n also be against&#13;
innovation. Many of these negative influences on social demand for science&#13;
and technology are seen as results of the development strategy.&#13;
It then is argued, because of the lack of social and economic&#13;
pressures, that activities in science and technology become inward-looking&#13;
in the sense that the predominant, if not the only, criteria of success in&#13;
these activities become scientific and technical. Criteria of social use-&#13;
fulness and economic welfare do not come into the question. From another&#13;
point of view, scientific and technical activities become outward-looking.&#13;
The reason is that standards of achievement are measured solely against sta-&#13;
tus in relation to the international development of science and technology-&#13;
there is no counterbalancing measure of national social or economic achievement.&#13;
The main implications of this line of argument for the purposes&#13;
here are threefold. First of all, it suggests that the orientation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
scientific and technological work is unlikely to be related to practical&#13;
needs in the economy. This possibility is broadly confirmed by a number of&#13;
empirical studies and by the high proportion of basic research in the activi-&#13;
ties of the developing countries in science and technology.     Second, it&#13;
suggests that the organization of these activities--the types of institute in&#13;
which they are done, the way institutes are run, the lack of any infrastruc-&#13;
ture for relating to production, and so on--are likely to be real obstacles to&#13;
developing a more socially productive set of activities, even if external&#13;
conditions change. Third, it suggests that there may well be attitudinal&#13;
problems among scientists, engineers, and technologists about the types of&#13;
work that may be needed locally. The empirical evidence on this point is&#13;
mixed, which may in itself be a hopeful sign: there apparently are many&#13;
scientists and engineers who would like to be involved in more relevant work,&#13;
but cannot find opportunities for it.&#13;
Implicit in all these patterns is the all-round reliance on foreign&#13;
technology, reliance which has its own particular disadvantages for the&#13;
developing countries: the high costs of some transfers of technology, and&#13;
the inappropriateness of technology from the industrialized countries for the&#13;
developing countries. Both are widely discussed in the literature and shall&#13;
be dealt with only briefly.&#13;
In some industries, such as pharmaceuticals and electronics, tech-&#13;
nology tends to be a source of monopolistic power. 1/ Transactions that&#13;
involve monopolized technology frequently take the form of bargaining, in&#13;
which buyers in developing countries are in a weaker position than sellers&#13;
1/   "Product cycle" theories of trade draw heavily on this Schumpeterian&#13;
notion (Vernon 1966; Gruber, Mehta, and Vernon 1967; Hirsch 1967;&#13;
Hufbauer 1968).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
in advanced countries. The technologies are sold in complex package deals,&#13;
which might involve equity, trademarks, equipment, intermediate goods, tech-&#13;
nical support services, and the like. These deals have been shown in some&#13;
cases to provide the seller with a multiplicity of sources of profit, which&#13;
together produce a high rate of return and lead to a considerable outflow of&#13;
income and foreign exchange from the purchasing countries (Vaitsos 1974).&#13;
Essentially, the seller is able to use superior bargaining power to claim a&#13;
large proportion of the surpluses resulting from the project.&#13;
There no doubt are possibilities of controlling costs of monopo-&#13;
lized technology. A number of countries have set up regulatory agencies in&#13;
recent years. Mexico and Argentina, for example, require that technology&#13;
licenses be registered and have fairly sophisticated systems of examination.&#13;
The Indian Foreign Investment Board has similar functions. But achieving&#13;
control is technically and administratively difficult. Furthermore, for&#13;
highly monopolized technologies the supplier can nearly always find alterna-&#13;
tive investment outlets if any government proves to be too demanding in&#13;
controlling contractual terms. Generally, the high costs of monopolized&#13;
technology, as well as the limitations on local learning associated with&#13;
them, may favor more active development of local substitutes in some&#13;
sectors and countries. 1/&#13;
Another subject that has been extensively discussed is the inappro-&#13;
priateness of products and processes. The main focus of analysis has been on&#13;
the tendency for the capital-labor ratio of western types of technology to&#13;
increase in each product group (Atkinson and Stiglitz 1969; Stewart 1974).&#13;
To some extent, this outcome of innovation may be offset at each point in&#13;
1/   There are, however, some important qualifications to this idea.    See&#13;
part 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
time by the continued existence of a range of older vintages of technology&#13;
(Bhalla 1975), but this does not offset the general tendency. It is recog-&#13;
nized, of course, that inappropriateness of this kind--that is, high and&#13;
increasing capital-labor ratios--is more pronounced in some sectors than&#13;
others.&#13;
Oil refineries inherently are more capital-intensive than textile&#13;
factories. So the product mix associated with a particular pattern of indus-&#13;
trialization will determine how acute the problem of increasing capital&#13;
intensity is likely to be in any particular country. Stewart (1973) has&#13;
reinforced this emphasis on products with the idea that many innovations in&#13;
western economies generate new products which in themselves are inappropriate.&#13;
The main argument is that the products in question are adapted to high-income&#13;
markets and are unsuitable for mass consumption in the developing countries.&#13;
When such products are manufactured in developing economies, investment&#13;
resources are drawn away from production of mass-consumption goods to the&#13;
protected production of luxury commodities for the high-income part of the&#13;
urban market. 1/&#13;
A policy response to the use of inappropriate technology in develop-&#13;
ing economies plainly involves far more than technological measures. Ques-&#13;
tions of relative factor prices and product-pricing policy lead into much&#13;
wider issues of industrialization and development policy. Nevertheless, some&#13;
problems require a technical answer. In particular, the tendency toward in-&#13;
novations with increasing capital-labor ratios seems to be fairly general in&#13;
1/ At least, this is one of the arguments Stewart advances. Another is that&#13;
the new products themselves are more capital-intensive in production than&#13;
older ones. Both arguments are open to empirical criticism: not all new&#13;
products are for high-income consumption, and not all new products are&#13;
more capital-intensive in production than old products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
all industrial and utilities sectors. The developing economies will have&#13;
to face the problem of finding alternative patterns of innovation that main-&#13;
tain the relative efficiencies of more labor-intensive technologies without&#13;
large increases in investment required per worker. In the long run, one&#13;
response might be to find ways of reducing the investment costs of existing&#13;
techniques of labor-intensive production through innovations in machine-making&#13;
sectors. More generally, the problem of inappropriateness, indeed of increas-&#13;
ing inappropriateness, reinforces arguments for building up local innovative&#13;
capabilities in developing economies.&#13;
3. PRIORITIES FOR BUILDING UP INNOVATIVE ACTIVITIES&#13;
So far, it has been described how the operation of international trade in&#13;
technology and technical services leads to marginalization: that is, to&#13;
the suboptimal development and use of innovative skills in the developing&#13;
countries. The marginalization argument goes further. It suggests that&#13;
the lack of opportunities for involvement in the productive sectors results&#13;
in the growth of scientific and technical communities whose objectives have&#13;
little to do with social and economic objectives.&#13;
The broad implications for policy are first, that various forms of&#13;
intervention by governments are likely to be necessary to counteract the&#13;
negative effects of the market on local innovation, and second, that this&#13;
intervention will include both actions to encourage innovative activities&#13;
directly and actions to control the tendency to rely excessively on foreign&#13;
technology. In all likelihood, neither form of intervention is sufficient by&#13;
itself to produce a greater amount of local innovation. For example, evi-&#13;
dence from some countries, such as India, suggests that even if technically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
successful R &amp; D activities are built up, they may not be used by the local&#13;
private sector unless access to foreign technology is restricted. In addition,&#13;
the few cases of successful development of large-scale engineering-design&#13;
enterprises-by PEMEX in Mexico and the Fertilizer Corporation in India, for&#13;
example-have resulted from policies that combined direct restrictions on the&#13;
use of foreign engineering design and active investment in local skills&#13;
(Roberts 1973).&#13;
The main question this paper addresses is, What should the priorities&#13;
be for government intervention aimed at increasing innovative capabilities&#13;
in developing economies? Before exploring this question in detail, some&#13;
general issues need to be touched on briefly. These issues center around the&#13;
rather obvious point that policies directed specifically to technology have to&#13;
be looked at in the framework of development policy as a whole.&#13;
Many critics of import-substitution policies have pointed out the&#13;
distorting effects those policies have on technological choices in the devel-&#13;
oping countries because of the influence on price structures (for example,&#13;
Little, Scitovsky, and Scott 1970). Others have emphasized how the same&#13;
policies not only tended to skew income distribution in favor of the urban&#13;
elite, but resulted in widespread import of foreign technologies to manufac-&#13;
ture the commodities they demand (for example, Stewart 1973). It is most&#13;
unlikely that alternative, more appropriate technology could have been used&#13;
in the context of such general strategies of development. Consequently, any&#13;
discussion of policies for innovation in developing countries-especially more&#13;
appropriate innovation--must be based on assumptions about broader policies&#13;
and ultimately on assumptions about social and political organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Assumptions of this kind shall obviously be made in the following&#13;
discussion. It is worth spelling out some of the more important ones.&#13;
Parts of the discussion in this section assume that governments&#13;
are able to make certain types of intervention that may in practice involve&#13;
considerable political difficulties. For example, it has been assumed in&#13;
some places that the government can control the pattern of consumption,&#13;
particularly high-income consumption, mainly by imposing limits on the kinds&#13;
of consumption good produced, possibly by taxation. This underlies some&#13;
of the discussion of responses to international transfers of technology.&#13;
In my view, some of such control is necessary in parts of the industrial&#13;
economy if there is to be room for local development of more appropriate&#13;
technologies. But the assumption plainly raises some serious philosophical&#13;
and practical problems.&#13;
It also is assumed that a number of supportive policies required to&#13;
encourage various patterns of innovation can be readily implemented--credit&#13;
policy for small-scale industry is an example. These often are directly&#13;
redistributive policies and once again would give rise to conflicts of inter-&#13;
est in many if not most countries. Then there is an implicit assumption in&#13;
parts of the analysis that some adjustments can be achieved in relative factor&#13;
prices and that these adjustments will tend toward greater equity between wage&#13;
levels in the formal and informal sectors. Some of such changes are almost&#13;
certainly necessary, whatever political organization is assumed to exist, but&#13;
they are clearly difficult to achieve.&#13;
Although a technology policy is a useful element--indeed an almost&#13;
certainly necessary element-in employment policy, it generally does not open up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
any easy ways around the social and political realities to be faced in imple-&#13;
menting policies for increased employment and a more equitable distribution&#13;
of income.&#13;
The main conclusion of part 2 is that the existing pattern of&#13;
international comparative advantages in innovation and technical skills&#13;
works to the disadvantage of the developing countries. Market forces,&#13;
reinforced by imperfections in international transactions in technology,&#13;
result in less growth of innovative skills in developing countries than&#13;
is socially desirable.&#13;
Nevertheless, the inadequacy of the present international division&#13;
of labor in innovative skills does not mean that the comparative costs of&#13;
building up local innovative capability, as opposed to importing technology,&#13;
can be ignored. Even in countries having social and political objectives&#13;
that encourage independence from western technology and western enterprises,&#13;
there is a serious consideration of costs of using foreign technology compared&#13;
with going it alone in all fields. For example, the Soviet Union and China&#13;
from time to time made extensive use of western technology. Soviet imports&#13;
of technology in basic industries were considerable in the 1930s (Sutton&#13;
1968). More recently the Soviets have imported technology for intermediate&#13;
goods (mainly chemicals) and some final products, too (consumer goods and&#13;
motor cars). Since the end of the Soviet period in 1952, China has made&#13;
significant imports of technology for capital goods and intermediate goods,&#13;
though the relative emphasis on foreign technology seems to have oscillated&#13;
considerably from time to time. 1/&#13;
1/   Heymann (1974) has said that China, in the "Soviet period," was the&#13;
recipient of what was "undoubtedly the most comprehensive technology&#13;
transfer in modern industrial history."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
This notion of comparative costs will play an important part in the&#13;
discussion of priorities for developing countries. The approach is to work&#13;
out areas in which the net social benefits of local development of technical&#13;
capability are likely to be greater than the net social benefits of technology&#13;
imports. This cannot be done quantitatively, but some reasonable guidelines&#13;
can be given. So, the approach consists of an analysis of comparative costs&#13;
of these alternative lines of action, leading to a broad specification of&#13;
priorities.&#13;
The definition of a country's stance in relation to foreign tech-&#13;
nology is only one component of policy toward local innovative skills. The&#13;
other concerns the type of local institutional framework needed to encour-&#13;
age innovation (in the broad sense in which the term is defined here). The&#13;
history of technological development in various countries underlines the&#13;
importance of institutional structures favorable for building up the innova-&#13;
tive process locally. Knowledge of Chinese experience suggests that there&#13;
has been extensive experimentation with different types of organization for&#13;
innovation--both in the rural economy and in the large-scale urban industries&#13;
(Dean 1973; Ishikawa 1973). There have been parallel (though not precisely&#13;
similar) processes in which the governments of market economies have played&#13;
an active role--for example, Germany in the late nineteenth century (Landes&#13;
1969) and Japan since the Second World War. In Japan in the 1960s, the&#13;
role of government seems to have included direct encouragement to individual&#13;
firms and branches of industry to build up active institutions for innova-&#13;
tion. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry had dual functions:&#13;
it controlled the terms of access to foreign technology and intervened in&#13;
the development of innovative skills in local industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Three main factors are likely to influence the comparative social&#13;
costs of building up local innovative capability as opposed to importing&#13;
technology:&#13;
*    The nature of particular "innovative specializations"&#13;
and the initial availability of specialist skills in&#13;
the country.&#13;
*    The nature and complexity of the technology.&#13;
*    The terms under which technology is available from&#13;
abroad.&#13;
Each of these factors will be discussed in turn in an attempt to work out some&#13;
priorities for policy toward innovation. That discussion will be followed in&#13;
the next part by a brief analysis of the patterns of innovative activity&#13;
that might be needed in developing economies.&#13;
Innovative Specializations and Initial Endowments&#13;
Some of the specialized skills that enter the innovative process&#13;
have already been listed. It has also been argued that the development&#13;
of these skills-even though usually involving some formal education and&#13;
training--depends on the accumulation of experience or learning-by-doing. The&#13;
idea to be examined here is that learning-by-doing is likely to be cheaper in&#13;
some skill categories than in others.&#13;
Encouragement of learning-by-doing usually depends on direct inter-&#13;
vention to encourage the use of local skills rather than importation. So,&#13;
one way to approach the question of comparative costs is to examine the&#13;
categories of skill typically imported in transfers of technology from abroad&#13;
and to ask which of them might be substituted by locals at comparatively low&#13;
social cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Most transfers of technology between a foreign and a local firm&#13;
are transfers of a range of technical skills, which essentially are the ones&#13;
required in the investment phase of industrial projects: 1/&#13;
o    Feasibility and preproject analytical skills.&#13;
*    Skills required in preliminary choice of production&#13;
methods and in initial design.&#13;
e    Detailed engineering-design skills.&#13;
*    Skills involved in the choice, acquisition, and con-&#13;
struction of process and product technology (including&#13;
machine construction).&#13;
e    Engineering-construction skills.&#13;
O    Commissioning and initial operation skills.&#13;
*    Operation skills, including maintenance and repair.&#13;
Because these skills are also needed in innovation, the list could be cross-&#13;
classified with the categories of innovative skills discussed earlier. This&#13;
is fairly clear for machine building and the development of process and&#13;
product technology. It also is true of the various informational activities&#13;
involved in preliminary choice of production methods and of the more complex&#13;
engineering required for design, adaptation, and detailed choice. Thus the&#13;
development of these categories of skill in developing economies will result&#13;
not only in greater local participation in the investment phase of industrial&#13;
projects; it will also provide resources for innovative activities.&#13;
In other words, to build up local innovative capability, it usually&#13;
is necessary to restrict the use of particular categories of foreign skill&#13;
1/   There is a discussion of this classification in Cooper and Sercovitch&#13;
(1971), in which the different skill categories are called "elements&#13;
of technology."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
in the technology transfer so as to create opportunities for local learning-&#13;
by-doing. The comparative costs of doing so will be different for different&#13;
categories, because some categories require more complex skills than others&#13;
and consequently demand longer periods of formal technical training, a greater&#13;
amount of on-the-job experience, or both. R &amp; D skills required in the gen-&#13;
eration of new process and production technology probably are the most costly&#13;
to acquire. The direct costs of R &amp; D are very high in some industries. 1/&#13;
It has been suggested that minimum levels of R &amp; D may be needed, if there&#13;
is to be an innovative output at all (Freeman 1975).&#13;
As far as industrial investment is concerned, skill and experience--&#13;
particularly experience--probably counts more in the later stages. The possi-&#13;
bilities of irreversible errors that might lead to potentially heavy costs are&#13;
greater in the later stages. So the perceived risks of using local skills&#13;
are generally greater in final choice, fabrication, and construction phases&#13;
than, say, in feasibility and preproject analysis, designing, and initial&#13;
considerations of technical choice.&#13;
In addition to the differences in the categories of skill that&#13;
should be developed, there are considerable differences between countries&#13;
in initial skill endowments. These differences affect the extent to which&#13;
foreign skills can be immediately substituted. Larger and more industrial-&#13;
ized developing countries--India, Pakistan, and such Latin American countries&#13;
as Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina--already have a considerable supply&#13;
of R &amp; D skills; but as argued earlier, these capacities often are cut off&#13;
1/   For a discussion of the R &amp; D intensity of various industries in the&#13;
advanced economies, see OECD (1968).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
from the productive sectors. If there is a potentially productive applied-&#13;
research sector, the main object of policy should be to encourage its orienta-&#13;
tion to the productive sectors and to ensure that direct substitution by&#13;
foreign products and processes does not break the link between local insti-&#13;
tutes and productive enterprises. Doing this is particularly important if&#13;
the local institutes have developed commercially viable, though comparatively&#13;
untried, technologies.&#13;
The larger economies also are relatively better endowed with&#13;
engineering skills, and in many cases there is a high degree of differentia-&#13;
tion of engineering specialization. For them, the comparative costs of local&#13;
learning-by-doing will be much lower than in smaller countries, which have&#13;
few engineers and hardly any professional specialization.&#13;
But it is rather easy to underestimate the availability of skills in&#13;
many developing economies. The reason is that although an initial endowment&#13;
of innovative skills may exist in some countries, they may be rather undiffe-&#13;
rentiated. For example, there may not be a formally specialized engineering-&#13;
design profession, yet considerable capacity for design (and copying foreign&#13;
designs) may exist in small engineering shops or in mining and construction&#13;
workshops in the modern sector. Rather more limited capacities for ad hoc,&#13;
rough designing may also exist among sheet-metal workers and fabricators in&#13;
the informal sector, but even here the understanding of the principles of&#13;
design often is considerable.&#13;
Similarly, the capability to fabricate machines is easy to under-&#13;
estimate, especially in countries that do not have a formal capital-goods&#13;
sector. In comparatively small, unindustrialized economies, the capability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
for fabrication may be considerable in informal enterprises, such as motor&#13;
repair shops and metal-working and forging shops of various kinds. Even in&#13;
the formal sector the potential usefulness of small foundries and such larger&#13;
organizations as railway workshops (in Kenya and Tanzania, for example),&#13;
aircraft maintenance services, and mining and construction workshops (in&#13;
Zambia, for example) is usually overlooked by decisionmakers.&#13;
The main immediate problems of mobilizing these capabilities for&#13;
innovation seem to be these. First, local firms and research laboratories&#13;
that need to have some comparatively simple component fabricated fail to&#13;
recognize these capabilities and automatically look for foreign engineering&#13;
firms. Second, it is difficult to organize these capabilities--particularly&#13;
if the skilled workers are spread about in small workshops. For example,&#13;
skills may exist to produce comparatively complex sheet-metal structures, but&#13;
the sheet-metal shops of the informal sector may be too small, individually,&#13;
to take on production. Third, there are too few opportunities for upgrading&#13;
skills and introducing more sophisticated design capability. Despite these&#13;
restrictions, there is a good deal of casual evidence that the small informal-&#13;
sector workshops in developing countries have been able to innovate by copying&#13;
and adapting mechanical devices for customer firms (Bell and Cooper 1975;&#13;
Satyarakwit 1975).&#13;
Kind and Complexity of Technology&#13;
The social costs of encouraging local learning-by-doing in innova&#13;
tive activities also depend on the kind and complexity of the technologies&#13;
involved. Technologies can be more or less complex in at least three&#13;
different senses: complex to operate; complex to maintain; or complex to&#13;
create, adapt, or copy. Technologies that are complex from one of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
points of view may be comparatively simple from another. For example,&#13;
petrochemicals technology is comparatively easy to operate, but complex to&#13;
create, adapt, or maintain. The same probably is true of many more recent&#13;
production technologies for continuous-process industries in which technical-&#13;
ly complex control systems have displaced operator skills.&#13;
The main interest here is in the effect of technical complexity&#13;
on the comparative costs of building up local innovative capabilities.&#13;
This implies that the chief-though not exclusive--concern is with the&#13;
complexity of creating, adapting, and copying technology. The general pre-&#13;
sumption is that comparative costs will be more in favor of local innovative&#13;
skills in technologies that are less complex from this point of view. Com-&#13;
plexity in this sense or any other is difficult to define, even though it&#13;
is usually possible to make judgments of the "more" or "less" kind. There&#13;
have been some attempts to specify technological complexity more precisely,&#13;
but without notable success. The underlying problem is that complexity&#13;
is multidimensional and cannot be assessed by measures of a single variable.&#13;
Despite these difficulties, most people would probably agree that&#13;
oil refining, organic-chemicals production, and production of numerically&#13;
controlled machine drugs all use more complex technologies from the viewpoint&#13;
of innovation than, say, leather and textiles production, bakery industries,&#13;
small-scale metal working and toolmaking, production of basic engineering&#13;
systems for grinding, pressing, and cutting, or production of basic inorganic&#13;
chemicals. So the concept of complexity has some general meaning. For the&#13;
purposes here, it has the important function of distinguishing industrial&#13;
branches in which local skills might play a more important part-generally in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
branches that are less technically complex--from those for which the social&#13;
cost-benefit relation favors foreign sources of technology unless the country&#13;
is particularly well endowed with the appropriate skills. But even for&#13;
industrial branches in which technology is very complex in general, there may&#13;
be particular skills that can, and on social grounds should, be locally&#13;
supplied. These skills usually are associated with aspects of the technology&#13;
that are inherently less complex.&#13;
Despite the difficulties inherent in finding a satisfactory scale&#13;
for measuring complexity, it is possible, partly on historical grounds,&#13;
to make a rather broad distinction between different classes of technology,&#13;
which is appropriate to the concern here with complexity in the process of&#13;
innovation.&#13;
Industrial technology has developed through more or less defined&#13;
stages which might be labeled mechanical, electrical, chemical, and elec-&#13;
tronic. In parallel with this development-and causally related to it--the&#13;
division of labor in innovation has also evolved. Of the early mechanical&#13;
innovations in textiles, it is rather difficult to isolate the specialization&#13;
of technical functions. The innovators often were broadly skilled artisans,&#13;
who cannot be easily fitted into modern categories. Machine making later&#13;
became a differentiated sector in the economy and the various engineering&#13;
specializations began to emerge--particularly those in mechanical engineer-&#13;
ing. Later still, however, in the chemical and electrical industries, and&#13;
especially in electronic technologies, formal R &amp; D activities became an&#13;
important differentiated part of the innovative process.&#13;
Of course, the older mechanical-based industries have been influ-&#13;
enced by these later developments. There is a substantial amount of R &amp; D&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
in mechanical-engineering industries in the advanced economies. Even so, a&#13;
reasonable, if rough, generalization is that the highly specialized and&#13;
differentiated skills-like R &amp; D and highly specialized engineering--still&#13;
are comparatively much less important in industries using basically "mechani-&#13;
cal" technologies than in the more recent ones. In addition, mechanical&#13;
innovations, more than others, seem to originate in many different parts of&#13;
the innovation system. Many mechanical innovations are the outcome of inter-&#13;
action between machine users and machine makers and mainly involve engineering&#13;
designers. Some older parts of the electrical-machinery industry-the produc-&#13;
tion of small motors and dynamos, for example--have similar characteristics.&#13;
These differences in the relative importance of highly specialized&#13;
skills-especially R &amp; D-are significant for the developing countries.&#13;
Innovations that are strongly dependent on research-particularly more basic&#13;
research-are the ones for which developing economies are at the greatest&#13;
comparative disadvantage. Industries in the advanced economies devote vast&#13;
resources to R &amp; D in electronic capital goods, pharmaceuticals, aircraft,&#13;
fine chemicals, organic chemicals, and scientific instruments. These R &amp; D&#13;
resources tend to be concentrated in a comparatively small number of very&#13;
large enterprises. It would take many years before commensurate effort and&#13;
concentration could be built up in developing countries. Thus comparative&#13;
costs often are strongly in favor of importing new technologies in these&#13;
industries from the advanced countries. There may of course be exceptions&#13;
in particular lines of production. In addition, the terms under which the&#13;
technologies are obtained certainly need to be examined, because these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
are areas in which quasi monopolies of innovation are frequent. 1/ For most&#13;
developing countries, however, the general rule probably is reasonable. 2/&#13;
In short, it is expected that comparative costs of building up local&#13;
innovative capability will be more favorable in such industries as textiles,&#13;
clothing, leather processing, food processing, small-scale mechanical and&#13;
electrical engineering, plastics forming equipment and products, and agricul-&#13;
tural equipment-and in such other sectors as construction, building materials,&#13;
and water engineering. The acquisition of innovative skills in these sectors&#13;
probably is comparative easy-and local metal and machine-making craftsmen may&#13;
already possess a good deal of relevant capabilities. Consequently, the risks&#13;
in using local (and less-experienced) engineers, machine designers, and&#13;
fabricators are less than those in more modern sectors.&#13;
In many developing countries the match between the kinds of skill&#13;
that is available or can be readily created and the kinds of skill that&#13;
is needed to support innovation in these industries is reasonably close.&#13;
In addition, it seems easier to conceive of an innovative process biased in a&#13;
labor-using direction in these industries than, say, in petrochemicals and&#13;
other industries based on more recent technologies. Generally, the technical&#13;
possibilities for labor-capital substitution in more recent kinds of techno-&#13;
logical system are restricted to a few parts of the production process for&#13;
which mechanical methods are or may be used: in the transfer of materials and&#13;
products, for example, these processes are sometimes called ancillary. In&#13;
1/   See Vernon (1966).&#13;
2/   Some qualification is needed here.   Even though complexity favors importa-&#13;
tion of technologies rather than local innovation, local knowledge&#13;
of these complex technologies is very important, both in order to operate&#13;
them, and in the bargaining through which they are acquired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
mechanical systems, the range of action for capital-saving innovation appears&#13;
to be wider--both through the simplification and adaptation of machinery and&#13;
through the development of cost-reducing methods of machine production, say,&#13;
by a better exploitation of local machine-making sector.&#13;
The extent to which the industries based on mechanical technology&#13;
should be given priority in innovation policies obviously depends on other&#13;
questions. It will differ between countries, depending on the degree of&#13;
development, the size of the economy, and the pattern of industries and&#13;
innovative skills already in place. For the moment, however, the complexity&#13;
variable is being considered in isolation, and the argument here suggests that&#13;
it points in the general direction of a special emphasis on these industries.&#13;
A further aspect of the question of determining priorities is&#13;
that problems associated with economies of scale interact with those asso-&#13;
ciated with the complexity of technology in some industrial sectors. If the&#13;
technical economies of scale at the plant level are large, industrial invest-&#13;
ments naturally tend to be very large and indivisible. This pattern has the&#13;
effect of greatly increasing the potential losses that arise from errors in&#13;
the investment phase of a project--and thus of putting social and private&#13;
premiums on low-risk, relatively experienced foreign suppliers. The case for&#13;
using and developing local capabilities tends to be weakened if minimum plant&#13;
size is very large--even if the technologies are fairly simple, such as those&#13;
for some metallurgical processes and large-scale engineering. If the process-&#13;
es are also complex--such as those for oil refining, petroleum cracking,&#13;
classical steel works, and large-scale sugar mills---the comparative costs are&#13;
likely to favor foreign sources of technology more strongly still.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Terms of Access to Foreign Technology&#13;
Foreign technology is acquired through different types of transac-&#13;
tion in markets of varying imperfection. In some sectors a few firms may&#13;
control virtually all technical variants that are commercially viable--either&#13;
through patents or unique combinations of corporate skills. At the other&#13;
extreme, there are technology markets with a large number of competing&#13;
suppliers for each element of technology. And in some sectors the two&#13;
kinds of supply situation coexist. Differences in the organization of&#13;
supply of technology have implications for the decision between local and&#13;
foreign sources.&#13;
The difficulties are considerable in finding a way of classifying&#13;
the different types of transaction, because the variety is so wide. A&#13;
rough classification is used here. The classifying variable is the degree&#13;
to which monopolistic elements are discernible in the transaction. If the&#13;
technology supplier has monopolistic advantages--perhaps because of the&#13;
process technology itself, but other kinds of monopoly are also possible--&#13;
these advantages can be expected to influence both the monetary costs of&#13;
acquiring the technology and the opportunities for building up local&#13;
skills.&#13;
The first class of transactions, to be divided in two subclasses,&#13;
includes the most highly monopolistic ones. Their most important characte-&#13;
ristic is that a single foreign enterprise usually organizes the supply&#13;
of virtually all the elements of technology required. This single enter-&#13;
prise may be a foreign firm that uses the technology in its own production&#13;
process or a foreign contractor or large machine maker.&#13;
If that single enterprise uses the technology in its own production&#13;
process-the first subclass-transactions usually take the form of license&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
contracts, which may or may not involve equity participation by the supply-&#13;
ing firm. These contracts often involve proprietary process or product&#13;
technology for which the supplier has a monopolistic advantage. But the&#13;
monopolistic advantage may originate in sources other than the technology,&#13;
such as brand-names or trademarks, which enable the supplier to demand a&#13;
more or less comprehensive contract, even though the technology involved&#13;
may be simple. That happens in some chemicals production--the manufacture&#13;
of aspirin, for example--and in the clothing industry. It probably is&#13;
fairly widespread in the consumer-goods sector. Generally, the supplier's&#13;
incentive to include all the elements of technology in the contract stems&#13;
from the desire to minimize risks by using established sources of technology;&#13;
it is enhanced by needs for control over the operation (Sercovitch 1974).&#13;
Such contracts often include restrictive clauses specifying such things as&#13;
the sources of supply of raw materials and intermediates and the areas of&#13;
the world in which the final product may be marketed (Cooper and Sercovitch&#13;
1971; Vaitsos 1974).&#13;
The dominating foreign enterprise can also be a producer of&#13;
machinery or a contracting firm--the second subclass of monopolistic&#13;
transactions. In this case the transactions usually involve purchases of a&#13;
production system in a more or less integrated form: an example is a&#13;
turnkey project for the supply of a fertilizer plant. But this subclass&#13;
includes all transactions in which a foreign contractor firm, which might&#13;
also be a machine producer, takes over responsibility for the provision of&#13;
an integrated production system, such as an integrated plant or a production&#13;
line. The contracting firm commonly subcontracts for the supply of other&#13;
elements of technology which it cannot supply; but it sometimes is able to&#13;
supply virtually the whole range of services and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
A number of rather different factors can lead to such highly inte-&#13;
grated transactions. In some cases, particularly in some of the turnkey&#13;
projects, the main reason is that the investor in the developing economy has&#13;
virtually no alternative because the skills required to put the process&#13;
together simply are not locally available. But this is not always the case.&#13;
Often the suppliers themselves have incentives to sell integrated systems.&#13;
For example, advanced-country machinery producers who produce a comparatively&#13;
wide range of individual machine components needed for a production line may&#13;
be able to increase turnover by marketing the whole production system, selling&#13;
individual components or technical skills only on a restrictive basis. Some-&#13;
times, the machine-producing firm also has monopolistic advantages that can be&#13;
used to encourage investors to buy the integrated system of production rather&#13;
than the components. For example, the machinery supplier may hold a patent on&#13;
a subprocess that is then in a strong position to influence any firm wishing&#13;
to purchase the subprocess to buy an integrated production system, even though&#13;
markets are competitive for other components in the line. This pattern&#13;
appears in the particle-board industry, for example, in which some machinery&#13;
suppliers will sell their processes only in highly integrated packages under&#13;
license (Cooper and Maxwell 1975).&#13;
At the other end of the spectrum from these highly monopolized&#13;
transactions are transactions that involve comparatively simple and widely&#13;
known production techniques, such as textile looms or spinning frames. These&#13;
transactions typically involve direct dealings with machinery suppliers. In&#13;
these transactions, however, the investor or some local contractor takes on&#13;
the functions of putting the production system together and specifically of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
purchasing the various elements of technology needed to do so. In this case,&#13;
direct purchases of machinery from a number of different component suppliers,&#13;
rather than purchases of integrated production systems, are characteristic.&#13;
License agreements are rare, though some trademark and brand-name agreements&#13;
are found--in the clothing industry, for example, or in the manufacture of&#13;
simple electrical household appliances.&#13;
Between these two classes of transaction is a considerable range of&#13;
intermediate types--all of which are difficult to classify in a simple way.&#13;
Policy Considerations&#13;
Three main difficulties associated with the more monopolized trans-&#13;
fers of technology were mentioned earlier: first, the transfers usually&#13;
involve heavy social costs because of the expatriation of profits; second,&#13;
the technologies involved and the products they are used to make often are&#13;
inappropriate; third, the packaging of the technology restricts opportunities&#13;
for local learning-by-doing.&#13;
The heavy social costs and the inappropriateness associated with&#13;
the more monopolized technologies suggest that the comparative social costs&#13;
of local innovative capability might be low. But this conclusion does not&#13;
necessarily follow. Many of the more monopolized technologies are complex and&#13;
involve innovation-intensive R &amp; D, in which developing countries are at a&#13;
comparative disadvantage. Furthermore, even if the technologies are simple,&#13;
it may be difficult to get the foreign supplier to agree to greater local&#13;
participation in the transfer. Comprehensive technical contracts can be&#13;
institutional obstacles to the use and development of local capability. They&#13;
may be regarded as introducing additional biases against local skill develop-&#13;
ment, over and above those that arise from the operation of the market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
What, then, are the main implications for policy?&#13;
First, there is a need to explore ways of reducing reliance on&#13;
the first group of monopolistic transactions, particularly if they are&#13;
concerned with luxury consumption goods to meet the demand of high-income&#13;
groups. In general, if there are alternative products for which the&#13;
technology can be obtained on less restrictive conditions--and with greater&#13;
local technical participation--a careful examination of those products&#13;
would be expected. This examination would be especially important if the&#13;
innovative foreign products threaten, through product differentiation, to&#13;
displace outputs of the informal sector--a point that will be explored in&#13;
more detail below.&#13;
Second, there are some areas in which it may be difficult to&#13;
find alternatives to a highly integrated transaction, but in which the&#13;
government may nevertheless be able to create wider opportunities for local&#13;
engineers and scientists by entering the bargaining. Examples of doing&#13;
this successfully are the development of petrochemicals and oil-field&#13;
engineering by PEMEX in Mexico and the effort to develop engineering groups&#13;
attached to the fertilizer and iron-and-steel industries in India.&#13;
Third, if integrated transactions are unavoidable, it is important&#13;
to develop some means for controlling the social costs they may involve.&#13;
Vaitsos's study of the pharmaceutical, electronics, and synthetic rubber&#13;
industries in Colombia shows how high these costs may be in uncontrolled&#13;
situations in which the technology supplier has a large amount of freedom&#13;
in determining the terms of sale. He has also shown that comparatively&#13;
simple control procedures can produce considerable savings (Vaitsos 1974).&#13;
One example of legislation designed to control payments for technology is&#13;
Article 24 of the Andean Pact agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
There naturally are some constraints on the extent to which coun-&#13;
tries can reduce the need for more monopolized technologies from abroad,&#13;
constraints arising from the structure of demand for final products. On the&#13;
face of it, a policy that puts a high priority on local innovative skills has&#13;
the implication that the unmonopolized, mainly mechanical and simple electric-&#13;
al technologies would be favored. There are constraints, however, on the&#13;
extent to which developing countries can concentrate their investments in&#13;
these technologies alone. In particular, the pattern of demand may lead to&#13;
a product and technology mix in which there is not much room for local&#13;
skill development:&#13;
e    Production for export markets may require the use of&#13;
complex and sometimes monopolized technologies.&#13;
*    Production for the local market may displace older, more simple&#13;
technologies or more generally lead to an emphasis on complex&#13;
monopolized technology.&#13;
The requirements of export markets may constrain the choice of&#13;
technologies and technology suppliers. For example, can making in develop-&#13;
ing countries is often linked to food-processing industries for export mar-&#13;
kets. It is argued that the strict standards required by advanced-country&#13;
markets for canned foods means that can production must be based on high-speed&#13;
automated equipment--which is supplied by a comparatively few machine makers,&#13;
some of which are themselves can-making enterprises (Bell and Cooper 1976).&#13;
Similarly, the constraints on the types of technology may be narrow in other&#13;
areas--for example in some mining and ore-refining operations associated with&#13;
the production of nickel or aluminum. In addition, other considerations may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
reinforce these technical constraints. Many developing countries have&#13;
encouraged multinational firms to develop the export sector because of the&#13;
trade networks these firms have developed. This posture may have direct&#13;
effects on the kind of technology used (Bhalla 1975). It also creates&#13;
institutional arrangements that may make local acquisition of skills more&#13;
difficult.&#13;
It is possible to overstate the restrictions that export markets&#13;
impose. Many developing-country exports, particularly in manufacturing,&#13;
involve products that require comparatively uncomplicated labor-intensive&#13;
technologies. Some of these technologies may be "closed off" to local&#13;
technicians and engineers--for example, in electronics-assembly industries&#13;
owned by foreign enterprise--but that is not always the case. Furthermore,&#13;
the constraints imposed by quality considerations in export markets may&#13;
be overestimated, and governments may be led into unnecessary reliance on&#13;
quasi-monopolized or more complex technology. This seems to be the case in&#13;
can making: a number of Taiwanese firms exporting canned foods to Japan&#13;
and Western Europe were using cans made on relatively simple slow-speed&#13;
lines of local design and manufacture (Bell and Cooper 1975). The argument&#13;
about the requirements of export markets is not as generally valid as it&#13;
sometimes is made to seem--and the need to produce for export need not&#13;
always lead to the use of packaged technologies that restrict the development&#13;
of skills.&#13;
Production for the local market may also involve technologies&#13;
and institutional arrangements that are unfavorable to local innovative&#13;
skills, a possibility that can arise in a number of situations.&#13;
First, in some countries the policies of import substitution have&#13;
led to a general importation of technologies for the local industrial sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
The distortion of product and factor prices implied by these policies leads&#13;
to the use of technologies that are inappropriate from the viewpoint of factor&#13;
use. It also leads to the use of complex technologies for which the reliance&#13;
on foreign skills is heavy, the room for local skill development slight. It&#13;
is argued that the tendency to bring in complex technologies intensive&#13;
in foreign skills is reinforced by skewness in the distribution of income,&#13;
because the high-income groups demand innovative western consumer goods,&#13;
for which these technologies are necessary (Stewart 1974). For the most&#13;
part, the problems for local learning posed by this kind of policy cannot&#13;
be solved simply by technology policy. They obviously originate in a much&#13;
wider range of economic and political conditions and can only be solved by&#13;
changing those conditions (Cooper [ed.] 1973).&#13;
Second, new technologies have in some cases appeared, technolo-&#13;
gies that are more efficient than old ones at all factor prices and that&#13;
enable the product to be sold at lower market prices. Sometimes the pro-&#13;
duct is considerably modified, too. The displacement of sandals or rubber-&#13;
tire shoes by cheap plastic shoes is a case in point. This sort of substitu-&#13;
tion has one principal disadvantage: it often involves capital-intensive&#13;
technology that is much more complex than the older type. Technical changes&#13;
of this kind may pose real problems in developing countries, particularly if&#13;
they result in techniques of production whose engineering requirements are&#13;
much in advance of the skills available for design and fabrication.&#13;
There nevertheless is a third situation in which product substitu-&#13;
tion can take place and replace older technologies, but in which it is much&#13;
less clear that there are social gains in efficiency. An example is automatic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
continuous baking, which is replacing traditional baking in a number of&#13;
countries. Data on automatic baking from Chile (quoted in Cooper and Maxwell&#13;
1975) revealed an unexpected pattern that probably is not unusual. Sliced,&#13;
wrapped bread produced on automatic lines was displacing traditional bread,&#13;
even though its price per unit weight was considerably higher. The main&#13;
advantages of the automatic bakeries were their ability to advertise and, no&#13;
doubt, influence consumer tastes, as well as the longer shelf life of the&#13;
product. Against this are disadvantages associated with the use of capital-&#13;
intensive technology embodied in machinery systems that are designed abroad&#13;
and imported in toto. The smaller bakeries use locally designed and fabri-&#13;
cated equipment. In other words, some newer technologies displace older&#13;
products with net gains in efficiency in the economy, but this is not always&#13;
the case. It is not known whether the advantages of longer shelf life really&#13;
outweigh the social costs of the new technology, including the costs of a&#13;
diminished role for local designers and fabricators (Cooper and Maxwell 1975).&#13;
Similar doubts have been raised about the displacement of maize traditionally&#13;
ground in Kenya by maize ground in roller mills (Stewart 1974).&#13;
Whether the displacement of traditional products is mainly a result&#13;
of market imperfection, advertising, and some additional qualities of the&#13;
product (in which case net social gains are open to question) or whether it&#13;
mainly results from a more efficient use of all factors and lower prices, is&#13;
an empirical matter. But there would seem to be grounds for a more careful&#13;
examination of the social merits of newer products--perhaps particularly those&#13;
which involve brand names and trademarks--before their introduction. This is&#13;
likely to be an important component of a policy for the development of local&#13;
innovative skills, because in many cases the newer technologies diminish the&#13;
opportunities for their use.&#13;
&#13;

4. NOTES ON APPROPRIATE PATTERNS OF INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY:&#13;
THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF MACHINE MAKING&#13;
Examination of the costs of building up local innovative capability, in&#13;
comparison with those of importing technology, suggests patterns of&#13;
investment in innovation that may be appropriate in developing countries.&#13;
This section puts forward some suggestions about what those pattern might&#13;
be, and about the problems that might be encountered in encouraging their&#13;
development. It starts with a brief summary of policy guidelines. In&#13;
particular it is argued that machinery making and adaptation--and some&#13;
closely related innovative skills, such as design--are likely to be espe-&#13;
cially important in developing countries. Then there is a discussion of the&#13;
problems and possibilities of building up innovative, local machine making.&#13;
That discussion focuses on two points:&#13;
*    Local industries that are potential customers and their&#13;
relationship to the international technology market.&#13;
*    Different kinds of local machine-making enterprise and&#13;
the problems of making them more innovative.&#13;
Some Guidelines for Innovation Policy--The Role of Machine Making&#13;
What conclusions can be drawn from earlier sections about the&#13;
patterns of innovation required in developing countries?&#13;
First, the description of the process of innovation (part 1) pre-&#13;
cludes a linear approach. It suggests, for example, that the simple crea-&#13;
tion of research institutes will not do much to encourage innovation and&#13;
may do nothing at all. If the idea is taken seriously that innovation&#13;
usually involves interactions between different specializations, it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
necessary to examine the possibility that action will be needed, more or&#13;
less simultaneously, in a number of areas: design engineering; development of&#13;
technician skills in machine fabrication, where it exists; inception of machine&#13;
fabrication, where it does not exist; technical information services and&#13;
extension; and conceivably research and experimental development.&#13;
Second, comparative costs will favor certain types of innovative&#13;
skill more than others. For example, the kinds of industrial innovation that&#13;
are intensive in R &amp; D have a high social opportunity cost in most developing&#13;
countries. The advantage lies mostly with innovations based on design engineer-&#13;
ing (at various levels of sophistication) and aimed at adapting, copying, and&#13;
fabricating simpler machinery components.&#13;
Third, these considerations, as well as those of technological&#13;
complexity, suggest that the advantages of building up local innovative&#13;
capability will be greatest in industries based on mechanical technologies,&#13;
not on electrical, chemical, and electronic technologies, which are more&#13;
complex.&#13;
Machine making is likely to be important in the pattern of innova-&#13;
tion implied by the arguments about comparative costs. In general, the&#13;
capacity to copy, adapt, design, and develop machinery was central in the&#13;
historical process of innovation in the advanced countries. It still is&#13;
important in innovation in mechanical technologies. Furthermore, there is&#13;
some evidence that the machine-making firms in some developing countries&#13;
already are a source of innovation, sometimes the predominant source.&#13;
The comparative importance of machine making is all the greater&#13;
in developing countries when the focus is on the need for more appropriate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
innovations. The development of the machinery sector may be a necessary&#13;
condition for the development of efficient capital-saving, labor-using techno-&#13;
logies (Stewart 1975; Rosenberg 1976). Its contribution to this kind of&#13;
innovation may take a number of forms. For example, the local machinery firms&#13;
may provide technical adaptations of imported machinery in response to the&#13;
factor price conditions in the developing countries. Moreover, local machine&#13;
makers have in a number of cases been able to reduce investment costs by&#13;
simplifying imported machinery, or merely by being able to produce copies at a&#13;
lower cost than imported machines because of their lower labor costs.&#13;
Many kinds of machinery production are in themselves appropriate&#13;
to economic conditions and objectives in the developing countries. Machinery&#13;
production often is labor-intensive. The mechanical-engineering industries&#13;
in the United Kingdom, for example, are significantly more labor-intensive&#13;
than the textiles industries. It is true, of course, that the labor is mainly&#13;
skilled in varying degrees. It was argued earlier, however, that the kinds of&#13;
skill in question often exist in the developing countries, though they may be&#13;
rather difficult to recognize because they are not as highly differentiated&#13;
and specialized as in the advanced countries. Indeed, there is a certain&#13;
amount of evidence in some developing countries of a comparative advantage&#13;
in various types of machine making. Some mechanical-engineering industries&#13;
have emerged--despite the bias of import-substitution policies against them.&#13;
To summarize: the argument about comparative costs suggests that&#13;
the case for development of local innovative skills is strongest in relatively&#13;
uncomplex technologies, mainly mechanical technologies, and in kinds of&#13;
innovation for which R &amp; D is relatively less important, though it may of&#13;
course be needed. These kinds of innovation depend importantly on building&#13;
up local machine making.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Is it possible to be more precise about innovation policy in&#13;
developing countries? There are constraints--mainly because of the lack&#13;
of factual knowledge. It is possible, however, to take the analysis one&#13;
step further, by examining the implications of technological dualism in&#13;
developing-country industries for innovation policy.&#13;
Differences in Access to Foreign Technology between Large-scale&#13;
and Small-scale (Formal and Informal) Sectors, and Implications&#13;
for Local Machine Making&#13;
Among the most important potential local customers for machine-&#13;
making firms in developing countries are of course other manufacturing units&#13;
in the large- and small-scale sectors, units that use machinery in the&#13;
production of intermediate and final outputs.&#13;
As a rule production systems in the large-scale formal sector&#13;
are more complex than in small-scale informal enterprises. There are many&#13;
examples of this technological dualism: automatic bakeries and small-scale&#13;
batch bakeries; high-speed automatic can lines and hand-operated equipment&#13;
in the informal sector; and so on. Indeed, such dualism is one of the&#13;
obvious outcomes of technical choice in a dual industrial economy. It&#13;
reflects the greater possibilities for concentration of relatively low-cost&#13;
investible resources in the formal sector. It also reflects the easier&#13;
access of formal-sector enterprises to information about foreign technology,&#13;
to foreign exchange for importing it, to willing foreign licensors, and to&#13;
formally trained engineers and managers.&#13;
It is mainly in the larger-scale formal sector that the problems of&#13;
substitution by foreign technology are most pronounced, precisely because&#13;
access to foreign technology and technical skills is easier. This affects&#13;
considerably the opportunities for local machine makers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
In small-scale informal production, the question of foreign or&#13;
local technology comes up in a special form. Firms in this sector generally&#13;
have little direct contact with foreign sources of technology, but this&#13;
pattern is not universally true. For example, small-scale leather producers&#13;
in Thailand are supplied with various types of adapted mechanical technology&#13;
from small engineering workshops, but the technical information and materials&#13;
for chemical processes are supplied by agents from multinational chemical&#13;
firms. Such direct contacts of this kind are uncommon, however. For the most&#13;
part the various elements of technology needed by the firms are supplied by&#13;
the artisanal skills of people working in them, and by the adaptive and minor&#13;
innovative skills of small metal-working firms, engineering workshops, forges,&#13;
and metal-shaping enterprises. In a few cases, which have only been partly&#13;
studied by research workers, applied research laboratories have been success-&#13;
ful in supporting small-scale informal producers and encouraging them to&#13;
innovate. The activities of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)&#13;
in the development of mechanical technologies for agriculture may be an&#13;
example. The Central Leather Research Institute in Madras also has a reputa-&#13;
tion for successful innovation in very small enterprises (Nayudamma 1967).&#13;
Mostly, however, applied research institutes have had difficulties in establi-&#13;
shing contact with the small-scale informal sector (Bell and Hill 1975).&#13;
Firms in the small-scale informal sector provide the main markets for local&#13;
machine makers in many developing countries.&#13;
Because of this duality in the market for machinery, policymakers&#13;
need to consider two main questions, the answers to which will much affect the&#13;
scope for innovative local machine making:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
(a) How far and by what means should the larger machine&#13;
users in the formal sector be induced to turn to&#13;
local as opposed to foreign sources of supply?&#13;
(b) In what ways can the technological limitations of&#13;
local machine-making firms be overcome, so that&#13;
their somewhat restricted role in local innovation&#13;
can be enhanced?&#13;
At present, there is hardly any empirical basis for responding to&#13;
these questions; they have not had a prominent place in policy thinking.&#13;
As far as the first is concerned, it is true that "local-content" legisla-&#13;
tion in pursuit of import-substitution policies has created wider markets&#13;
for some machinery sectors in developing countries. Local-content policies&#13;
usually are pretty general in form, however, giving little attention to the&#13;
supply side in local machine-making sectors (and consequently, often&#13;
inducing renewed rounds of investment by foreign enterprise or licensing of&#13;
the more specialized local machinery-supplying firms--see below). As for&#13;
the second question, the main efforts have been to link machine makers to&#13;
governmental R &amp; D units, but these do not seem to have been successful.&#13;
Answers to either question depend in part on the structure or&#13;
organization of the machine-making sector itself.&#13;
Machine-making Sectors in Developing Countries: Duality on the Supply Side&#13;
Machinery-supply branches in developing countries show a similar&#13;
duality of structure to the rest of the industrial sector. In most larger&#13;
developing countries, it is possible to distinguish two kinds of machine-&#13;
making enterprise. First, there are specialized firms making components&#13;
for a comparatively small number of customers. Manufacturers of components&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
for automobiles and consumer durables are typical examples. Second,&#13;
there are small general-engineering shops. These commonly cover quite a&#13;
wide spread of firms, ranging from more sophisticated metal-forming enter-&#13;
prises in the more formal economy, to isolated sheet-metal craftsmen and&#13;
blacksmiths in the informal sector.&#13;
The appearance of specialized manufacturers of components is&#13;
frequently the result of local-content legislation in import-substituting&#13;
economies.   Such firms are often-though not invariably-linked to foreign&#13;
technology suppliers. Thus if the local-content requirement of automobiles&#13;
made by a foreign subsidiary is raised, the automobile maker may encourage&#13;
some of its foreign suppliers of components to invest locally, or to sign&#13;
technology contracts with local firms. A network of comparatively specia-&#13;
lized subcontracting firms can be built up in this way.&#13;
It is unclear how far such foreign-licensed specialist production&#13;
actually contributes to the development of local innovative skills. In&#13;
some cases-for example, in the production of simple electrical equipment&#13;
for automobiles-the local producer may be essentially concerned with the&#13;
assembly of imported components. In others, the skill requirements of&#13;
production may be more considerable. A general problem in this part of the&#13;
machine-making sector is that production is frequently done under exclusive&#13;
license from a foreign technology owner for one or a few customer firms.&#13;
Such exclusive contracts may restrict the extent to which specialist&#13;
machine makers can play an innovative role in relation to the rest of the&#13;
economy.&#13;
Small general-engineering firms, on the other hand, more commonly&#13;
are locally owned and may serve a comparatively wide range of customers. They&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
may be hired to make spare parts or for constructing simple plant components,&#13;
possibly copied from foreign designs. This sort of pattern exists in Thailand,&#13;
for example, where local machine makers have supplied components of can-making&#13;
plants to modern-sector multinationals. This nexus of local generalist firms&#13;
may be a valuable resource for further development. A conceivable scheme for&#13;
building up their capabilities might consist of the following elements:&#13;
*    A small group of economists and technologists--capable of studying&#13;
a number of industries--whose main objective would be to determine&#13;
opportunities for local fabrication by such firms.&#13;
*    A policy of controlling technology contracts entered into by poten-&#13;
tial customer firms (i) to avoid commitments to package deals that&#13;
exclude local fabrication and (ii) to inform potential customers of&#13;
local suppliers.&#13;
*    Technical support services in the form of information, design&#13;
training, and operative training for the machine-fabricating firms.&#13;
o    Possible access to supportive applied-research facilities, parti-&#13;
cularly if technologically complex problems are likely to arise:&#13;
problems in the physics and chemistry of materials; chemical-&#13;
reaction problems in basically mechanical processes, such as&#13;
tanning; control problems involving pneumatic or electrical systems;&#13;
and so on.&#13;
5. SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This paper has been concerned with the problem of how to determine priorities&#13;
for investment in science and technology related to nonagricultural production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
in developing countries. The approach has been to isolate factors that&#13;
influence the comparative costs of building up local innovative skills&#13;
and of importing technology from abroad. I have also tried to draw attention&#13;
to differences between formal and informal sectors in their organizational&#13;
requirements for innovation, and to the need for being selective in importing&#13;
technology from abroad. Innovation has been very broadly defined--and I&#13;
have emphasized that a number of different specialist skills are needed in&#13;
the innovation process.&#13;
The main conclusions of this discussion can be summarized briefly:&#13;
(i) Depending on the type of specialization in question,&#13;
the social costs of building up innovative skills will&#13;
differ. Costs and risks of local R &amp; D are likely to&#13;
be relatively high, as are those of acquiring advanced&#13;
design and construction-engineering skills. Acquiring&#13;
simpler design and machine-fabrication skills is&#13;
likely to involve lower social costs in the process of&#13;
learning-by-doing.&#13;
(ii) The extent to which the foregoing conclusion can be&#13;
taken as a guideline for policy depends on the initial&#13;
skill endowment in the country. Some larger economies&#13;
already have substantial capabilities in scientific&#13;
research and engineering. As a result, they have fewer&#13;
constraints on the development of local innovative&#13;
capability. The main policy problem is often to find&#13;
means of more selective importing of technology so as&#13;
to encourage the use of available scientific and&#13;
technical skills by local firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
(iii) The nature of the technology is also an important&#13;
variable. It has been suggested that production&#13;
systems based on mechanical technology are less&#13;
complex from the viewpoint of innovation than&#13;
chemical, electrical, and electronic ones. It was&#13;
argued that the comparative costs of building up&#13;
innovative skills in the (mainly) mechanical&#13;
industries may be lower than elsewhere.&#13;
(iv)  Terms of access to foreign technology vary con-&#13;
siderably. At one end of the spectrum, technology&#13;
is transferred to developing countries by highly&#13;
monopolistic transactions. At the ,other, markets&#13;
are more or less "competitive" for comparatively&#13;
simple, widely known production techniques. The&#13;
monopolistic transactions involve high social&#13;
costs always, and inappropriate technology some-&#13;
times; they also restrict opportunities for local&#13;
learning-by-doing. It is important to find ways&#13;
of using less restrictive alternatives, if these&#13;
exist. It sometimes is argued that the need to&#13;
develop manufactured exports may commit countries&#13;
to a reliance on monopolistic transfers of technology.&#13;
This is true--but only sometimes; many industrial&#13;
exports of developing countries are based on tech-&#13;
nologies that, comparatively, are widely available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Equally, the demand of high-income groups in the&#13;
domestic market may create a bias toward highly&#13;
innovative new products and monopolized technologies.&#13;
The circumstances in which this bias might need to&#13;
be countered by policy were also discussed.&#13;
(v) The analysis of comparative costs suggests that the&#13;
case for developing local skills is strongest in&#13;
relatively uncomplex technologies and in categories&#13;
of innovation for which R &amp; D is less important.&#13;
This would lead to an emphasis on local innovation&#13;
in industries based on mechanical technologies. In&#13;
these industries, a machine-making capability is&#13;
important in innovation, especially in opening up&#13;
the possibility of more appropriate innovations.&#13;
(vi) There are likely to be differences in the strategies&#13;
of innovation required in the formal and informal&#13;
sectors.&#13;
Broadly speaking, these conclusions point to a strategy in which selective&#13;
control over technology imports is accompanied by measures to encourage the&#13;
growth of local innovative skills in areas where social costs are likely to&#13;
be comparatively low. I have not paid much attention to the specific insti-&#13;
tutional arrangements that would be required to implement such a strategy.&#13;
This inattention reflects the rather limited experience to date with coherent&#13;
strategies of innovation in developing countries.&#13;
The implementation of the measures discussed here would inevitably&#13;
require a willingness to experiment with new types of organization. My&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
preference would be to see a number of partial and specific efforts of a&#13;
rather opportunistic kind to induce some particular innovations, say, in the&#13;
small-scale sector. This way of initiating social experimentation with&#13;
innovation would be better than, for example, setting up large new administra-&#13;
tive systems. But the lack of experience of this kind sets limits to what can&#13;
be said about the implementation of policy. Accordingly, the discussion has&#13;
been mainly confined to demonstrating that it is possible to draw up a nation-&#13;
al framework for policy in this area.&#13;
Before concluding, it seems appropriate to add some brief remarks&#13;
about the somewhat different implications that this approach to innovation&#13;
policy would have in different national circumstances. These remarks will&#13;
not meet the need for a more complete analysis of problems of implementation,&#13;
but they are a step in the right direction. In the discussion, contrasts are&#13;
drawn between the situation facing larger countries with substantial scienti-&#13;
fic and technical resources and a considerable industrial structure, such as&#13;
India, Brazil, and Mexico, and that in small, less well-endowed economies,&#13;
such as Kenya and Tanzania. I shall examine: first, approaches to the&#13;
control of foreign technology; second, the scale and organization of local&#13;
scientific and technical skills and how they relate to production; and third,&#13;
innovation in the informal sector (on which there is little information).&#13;
Many larger economies have set up administrative systems for moni-&#13;
toring the inflow of foreign technology in various ways. These systems&#13;
take various forms. In India, for example, the Foreign Investment Board is&#13;
required to ensure that contracts for foreign technology meet legal provisions&#13;
on such matters as royalty rates, the absence of certain types of restrictive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51 -&#13;
clause, maximum levels of foreign equity holding, forms of payment for tech-&#13;
nical services from the technology supplier, and so on. The monitoring&#13;
service is part of the machinery for control of foreign private investment in&#13;
general. It has been criticized for causing considerable administrative delay&#13;
in granting licenses--and has recently been reformed with some success to&#13;
improve administrative efficiency. The Mexican system of control and those of&#13;
some other Latin American countries are similar to India's in many of their&#13;
objectives. But they appear to operate more rapidly than the Indian system,&#13;
perhaps partly because the legal framework for foreign licensing is less&#13;
rigorous.&#13;
There are few adequate assessments of these technology-control&#13;
systems, but they do appear to have some common features and some common&#13;
problems. 1/ First, they are best at controlling a few simple variables, such&#13;
as royalty rates or the presence or absence of restrictive clauses. Second,&#13;
they are not very successful in the more complex matters of assessing the&#13;
technological implications of various contracts. Indeed, in some countries&#13;
they have little contact with techno'logical institutions. In India, the&#13;
Foreign Investment Board attempts to use advice of the Council for Scientific&#13;
and Industrial Research, but it appears that the relationship between the&#13;
institutions has not worked smoothly.   Third, and partly as a consequence of&#13;
the second point, control measures are directed much more toward short-run&#13;
costs than toward implications for local learning-by-doing.&#13;
In smaller economies, such as Kenya, the administrative apparatus&#13;
for controlling foreign investment and technology usually is much less sophis-&#13;
ticated. Most applications are treated on an ad hoc basis, and it is seldom&#13;
1/   See, however, National Council for Applied Economic Research (1971)&#13;
and Subramanhiam (1972) for some analysis of the older Indian systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
that much attention is paid to technological matters. In consequence,&#13;
there are frequent examples of technology imports that have been undertaken&#13;
with only limited consideration for the appropriateness of factor use (even&#13;
if alternatives are known to exist), for the availability of local resources,&#13;
or for the development of skills. Control measures are almost completely&#13;
confined to cost considerations.&#13;
In brief, it probably is fair to say that control over technology&#13;
imports in developing countries has mainly been concerned with a limited&#13;
range of variables--and that technological implications, especially those for&#13;
local R &amp; D, or engineering skills have not been systematically considered.&#13;
There are a few notable exceptions. State intervention and control over the&#13;
terms of technology imports have had some influence on developing local engi-&#13;
neering bureaux in a few industries: fertilizers, iron and steel, and larger-&#13;
scale mechanical engineering in India; petrochemicals and oil-field production&#13;
in Mexico; the oil industry in Algeria; and public-sector construction activi-&#13;
ties in a larger number of countries. Otherwise, however, the link between&#13;
local innovation capability and imported technology is hardly considered--&#13;
particularly in relation to the private sector.&#13;
In the larger economies, there is also a considerable accumulation&#13;
of capability in scientific research and to some degree in engineering. One&#13;
consequence of the lack of linkage between policies on imported technology&#13;
and policies on local innovation is precisely the pattern of marginalization&#13;
discussed earlier. The role for local skills is strictly confined and they&#13;
are often underused. This pattern is reflected particularly in the rather&#13;
ineffective role that has been played by the numerous councils or commissions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
for science and technology that countries have set up in recent years.&#13;
The comparative ineffectiveness of these institutions in creating a greater&#13;
role for local innovation is at least partly an outcome of policy for foreign&#13;
investment and technology.&#13;
This situation has produced two distinct responses in the councils.&#13;
One has been to argue that they will never be able to fulfil their mandates&#13;
unless there are changes in the response to imported technology. The other&#13;
has been to argue that the councils should confine themselves to creating&#13;
high-level basic research capability as an investment for the future. The&#13;
second argument reflects a sort of devolution: most of the councils were set&#13;
up in the first place to counter the exclusive emphasis on basic research and&#13;
to generate more economically productive scientific activity.&#13;
Scientific and technical skills for innovation are much scarcer&#13;
in the smaller economies. Consequently, the phenomenon of marginalization&#13;
usually is less noticeable. But it still is present. In some cases, for&#13;
example, local engineering faculties find it difficult to develop research&#13;
oriented to local technological problems--partly because of the educational&#13;
requirements set by formal-sector enterprises (Cooper 1973). Even in the&#13;
smaller economies, however, there often is a considerable underestimation&#13;
of the level and amount of engineering skill available. I discussed this&#13;
earlier.&#13;
For small-scale informal production, there is not much information.&#13;
It is pretty certain, however, that the formal sector's activities in applied&#13;
science--even in the large economies--have had little effect on informal&#13;
sector production. Once again, there are a few apparent success stories,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
which are insufficiently analyzed but which conceivably could teach a great&#13;
deal. The Central Leather Research Institute in Madras, for example, has&#13;
produced innovations in small-scale informal tanning activities in India.&#13;
I referred earlier to recent work on agricultural-mechanization technology&#13;
at the IRRI. And I also referred to the growing evidence of significant&#13;
minor innovations in the informal sector, usually centered around machine&#13;
makers. 1/&#13;
Generally, in large and small economies, the evidence is that&#13;
there has been little systematic examination of the set of policies that might&#13;
be needed to induce more local innovative activity. Indeed, there are plenty&#13;
of cases in which the policies followed in one field contradict those in&#13;
another. Policies toward foreign technology undermine policies for building&#13;
up a productive science-and-technology activity; policies for formal-sector&#13;
development undermine the activities of the informal sector. And so on.&#13;
It is difficult, even dangerous, to respond to this situation&#13;
simply by formulating a systematic integrated policy at national level.&#13;
That could lead all too easily to a new growth of policymaking institutions&#13;
and coordinating systems, which might do more harm than good. The next&#13;
steps must be to accumulate much more systematic knowledge about conditions&#13;
for succcessful innovation--particularly in the informal sector, about which&#13;
knowledge and information are singularly lacking -- and simultaneously to start&#13;
a program of experimenting with actual innovations in a number of countries.&#13;
1/   Some of these in Kenya are discussed in King (1975) and ILO (1973).&#13;

            This paper assesses the potential social
            pay off of alternative measures that might be taken to
            promote innovation in LDCs. It is mainly concerned with the
            general issues of encouraging technical innovation in the
            nonagricultural sectors. However, it also is focused on the
            more particular but important question of how to generate
            innovations that lead to new techniques of production which
            are better suited than existing ones to the social
            objectives of employment and greater equality in the
            distribution of income. Part 1 discusses the process of
            innovation and describes the skills associated with it. Part
            2 sets forth some of the special problems that developing
            economies encounter in building up innovative skills. Part 3
            draws together some of the main implications for policy and
            explains how priorities for the development of local
            innovative activities might be determined. Part 4 analyzes
            the patterns of innovative activity that might be needed in
            developing economies. Part 5 summarizes the main conclusions
            and suggests some of the implications of adopting an
            approach that stems from these conclusions.
