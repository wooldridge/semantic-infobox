TECHNICAL ANNEX 1/&#13;
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.          Introduction and Overview. China's fiscal system has come under stress&#13;
over the reform period since 1978. The reforms initiated a major shift of the tax base&#13;
away from the sectors traditionally tapped by the tax system, and government revenues&#13;
declined from over 34 percent of GNP in 1978 to less than 16 percent in 1993. Tax&#13;
buoyancy was undermined by loose collection and tax exemptions that were induced by&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal contracts, and facilitated by the decentralized tax administration&#13;
system. The reduced budgetary resources were handled by a budget system that was still&#13;
geared toward financing the State Plan, and a proliferation of extra- and off-budget funds&#13;
increasingly undermined the macro- and microeconomic functions of the budget.&#13;
2.           Against this backdrop, China's authorities have recently introduced sweeping&#13;
reforms of their fiscal policies and practices, which the proposed project would support.&#13;
The reforms were endorsed in the "Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth&#13;
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" in November 1993. The reforms&#13;
can be broadly divided into four parts: (a) a major overhaul of the tax system; (b) the&#13;
creation of separate tax administrations for central and shared taxes (National Tax Service,&#13;
NTS) and local taxes (the Local Tax Service, LTS); (c) a restructuring of&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal relations; and (d) the passing of an organic Budget Law. This&#13;
section presents the reforms and their background in more detail.&#13;
Key Issues in Fiscal Policy&#13;
3.           Tax Policy. China's tax structure has become increasingly incapable of&#13;
raising sufficient revenues.  At the beginning of the reform  period, the decline in&#13;
government revenues was mainly caused by increased independence of state-owned&#13;
enterprises (SEs), which were no longer obliged to submit all their profits to the budget.&#13;
In 1984, a separation of taxes and profits was established with the introduction of SE&#13;
income taxes. Increased competition from the nonstate sector rapidly eroded both profits&#13;
I/  This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission in January 1995, consisting of Zafer Ecevit&#13;
(Chief, EA2CO, mission leader), Bert Hofian (Economist, EA2CO; Task Manager), and Ike&#13;
Ikamuullah (Senior Technology Specialist, IENTI). The appraisal mission cooperated with a parallel&#13;
IMF mission, consisting of: Carlos Silvani (Advisor, mission leader), John Brondolo (Tax Systems&#13;
Information Officer), Tony Pellechio (Economist, IMF), and Alan Landsberg (Panel Expert).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
and taxes from SEs. The buoyancy of the tax system was further undermined by the&#13;
contracting of profits and taxes between government and SEs since 1988, and the practice&#13;
of debt repayment deduction from taxes. These practices also provided the impetus for&#13;
strongly procyclical SE behavior, and recurrent excess investment demand. Furthermore,&#13;
tax contracting distorted competition among SEs, as the terms of their contract depended&#13;
on the financial strength of their local government. In the early 1990s the practice of tax&#13;
contracting was increasingly extended to the turnover taxes, eroding further the tax share&#13;
in GDP.&#13;
4.          Competition was further distorted by the complexity of the tax system,&#13;
which, despite a number of reforms, had 33 taxes, a multitude of rates for every tax, and&#13;
high marginal statutory tax rates on enterprise income, that varied by ownership. The&#13;
turnover taxes-mainly business tax, value added tax (VAT), and product tax-had a&#13;
myriad of rates, in part to compensate for the incomplete price reforms, and in part to&#13;
penalize "undesirable" consumption. The VAT, introduced in 1984, was gradually&#13;
extended to more products and sectors, and by 1993 had become the main revenue source&#13;
(Attachment 2).&#13;
5.          Tax Administration. Until recently, the decentralized tax administration&#13;
acted on behalf of both central and local governments. In principle, the tax administration&#13;
was under the "dual leadership" of local governments and the State Administration of&#13;
Taxation (SAT), the central tax authorities. SAT was established in 1988. Before that,&#13;
the administration was a department under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The tax&#13;
administration is large by any international standard, with over 30,000 offices at four levels&#13;
(Table 1).2/  The district/county-level offices have primary responsibility for the tax&#13;
collection at larger enterprises, whereas tax collection stations focus on small enterprises.&#13;
Total personnel is now over 600,000, and is rising fast. The collection of taxes on&#13;
imported goods is delegated to Customs, and the agricultural taxes are collected by Finance&#13;
Bureaus. SAT has two training colleges, with about 400 teachers, mostly specialized in&#13;
basic tax theory.&#13;
6.          Over the 1980s and early 1990s, tax administration has increasingly become&#13;
an arm of local government. To attract investment, local government granted legal and&#13;
illegal tax exemptions, which contributed to the lack of buoyancy in tax revenue, and&#13;
central revenue in particular. Besides such political pressures, the tax administration has&#13;
faced a growing number of taxpayers, now amounting to 33 million, with over 1 billion&#13;
of transactions with taxpayers annually. The administration increasingly failed to manage&#13;
these numbers, despite the growth in the number of tax administrators. Efficiency has&#13;
been hampered by the lack of specialization of tax administrators, the concentration on tax&#13;
assessment and collection, instead of audit, and by the widespread system of "resident' tax&#13;
administrators in enterprises, which encourages a negotiated approach to paying taxes.&#13;
Moreover, the tax administration practices differed from locality to locality, distorting&#13;
competition, and undermining equality.&#13;
Z/ The tax collection station falls directly under the city/prefectural level, and is considered a branch of&#13;
that level.&#13;

/a SAT reported that total personnel exceeded 600,000 by mid-1994.&#13;
7.          China has made tax computerization efforts since 1986, with investments of&#13;
over $150 million in about 5,000 offices. There are some 4,000 technicians working in&#13;
the administration, and over 20,000 operators.  Most of the computer applications&#13;
developed have been less than fully effective because they concentrated on computerizing&#13;
existing procedures instead of first reforming the tax administration procedures to increase&#13;
overaUl efficiency. Moreover, the computerization that took place has not been coordinated&#13;
centrally, leading to a proliferation of systems and procedures among localities.&#13;
Computerization of some administrative functions was further hindered by the absence of&#13;
unique taxpayer's identification numbers (TlNs).&#13;
8.          Intergovermnental Fscal Relations.  China's intergovernmental fiscal&#13;
relations have changed considerably during the reform period. The most fundamental&#13;
change occurred in 1980, when the principle of "eating from separate kitchens" was&#13;
introduced, giving local governments more autonomy over their fiscal affairs by means of&#13;
what amounted to a contracting system. The fiscal contracts were formalized in 1988.&#13;
The contract system assigned taxes and tax shares to either central or local government.&#13;
The excess of local revenues over 1987 "base number" expenditures was to be remitted to&#13;
the central government according to a contracted rate, and a shortfall of revenues over&#13;
1987 expenditures was financed by a transfer from the center. The contracted local&#13;
retention rates were high, and bolstered local revenues in times of high growth and&#13;
inflation. In addition to the contracted revenues, local governments received a number of&#13;
earmarked transfers, predominantly for covering losses of SEs and for price subsidies.&#13;
9.          The intergovernmental fiscal arrangements gave local governments high&#13;
incentives for promoting growth, but also caused central tax buoyancy to decline. The&#13;
decline in tax buoyancy-accelerated by legal and illegal tax exemptions-hampered central&#13;
government's control over total budgetary expenditures, and reduced its role in equalization&#13;
among provinces. The contract system added to the procyclical tendencies of China's&#13;
economy, as the budget rules allowed local governments to spend their actual revenues,&#13;
which were higher in times of boom and lower in times of growth recessions. Revenue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
assignments also introduced distortions in investment behavior by local governments.&#13;
Local shares in the product taxes encouraged investment in those industries that were&#13;
meant to be discouraged.&#13;
10.         Budget System. China's budgetary system has been an efficient resource&#13;
mobilizer for the Plan, but the system has not kept up with the reforms in the rest of the&#13;
economy, and is insufficiently equipped for its emerging role as an allocation and&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization instrument. The budget no longer fully reflects the fiscal&#13;
responsibility of the government, due to a proliferation of extra- and off-budget funds that&#13;
remain outside budget controls. The budget classification system is less suited for policy&#13;
analysis, cost computation, and for internal management. The budget compilation process&#13;
is largely incremental, projections are less than accurate, and the control over outlays is&#13;
weak, which contributes to economic cycles and weakens allocation through the budget.&#13;
The effectiveness of audits is restricted by lack of detail in the budget classification and&#13;
reporting procedures.&#13;
11.         The People's Bank of China (PBC) treasury department manages the vault&#13;
function well, and once in the treasury accounts, money is transferred relatively efficiently.&#13;
However, cash management has not been fully developed since the treasury had until&#13;
recently access to funding from PBC for short-term needs. Expenditure control, which&#13;
should be exercised by the MOF-Budget Department, suffers from lack of a detailed budget&#13;
and lack of an efficient information system. Capital budgeting techniques are hardly&#13;
present in the MOF and Finance Bureaus, as the public investment process used to be&#13;
handled largely by the State Planning Commission (SPC). Planning and budgeting are&#13;
virtually separated, as most of the public investments are handled by SPC, and recurrent&#13;
costs of the investments have increasingly been funded from extrabudgetary sources.&#13;
Recent Reforms&#13;
12.         The decline in the share of government revenues in GNP and central share&#13;
in the revenues in particular caused loss of macroeconomic control, because government&#13;
expenditures were not reduced in line, but were increasingly financed through policy&#13;
lending of the banking system. This loss of macroeconomic control led to sweeping&#13;
reforms in financial and fiscal policies and institutions that were announced in November&#13;
1993. The fiscal reforms are aimed at halting the decline of government revenues through&#13;
tax and tax administration reforms, and a gradual centralization of the revenues through&#13;
a rearrangement of intergovernmental fiscal relations. The Budget Law, which passed the&#13;
National People's Congress (NPC) in March 1994, should lead to better control over&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
13.         Tax Policy. The reforms announced at the beginning of 1995 aim for a&#13;
major restructuring of the tax system, which reduces the number of taxes from over 30 to&#13;
18, and greatly improves the overall structure (Attachment 3). The main reforms consist&#13;
of: (a) a broadening of the VAT to include parts of the Product Tax and Business Tax,&#13;
a reduction of the rates to two (17 and 13 percent) and a switch to the credit invoice&#13;
method; (b) a unification of the EIT for all domestic enterprises, with a standard rate of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33 percent,3/ and the abolition of tax contracting and debt principal repayment&#13;
deduction; (c) abolition of the Energy and Transportation Tax and the Budget Adjustment&#13;
Tax for SEs; and (d) a unification of the PIT. Various minor taxes are or will be merged&#13;
or abolished, the Resource Tax will be expanded, and a Securities Trading Tax will be&#13;
introduced.&#13;
14.         The State Council has assigned MOF principal responsibility for the&#13;
formulation of tax policy while SAT will concentrate more on tax administration. The&#13;
provinces have gained a very limited autonomy in setting rates for certain business taxes,&#13;
and the authorities are considering the possibility of gradually extending this autonomy.&#13;
15.         Over the first seven months of 1994, revenues from  industrial and&#13;
commercial taxes (including VAT, Consumption Tax and EIT) grew at about 30 percent&#13;
in nominal terms over the same period in 1993. However, overall budgetary revenues&#13;
grew only by 18 percent, thus still lagging behind nominal GNP growth. The authorities&#13;
realize that further tax reforms will be necessary to reverse the decline in government's&#13;
revenue share in GNP.&#13;
16.         Tax Administration.  To implement the tax reforms and the new&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal relations, China's authorities intend to fundamentally reform the&#13;
tax administration. The tax administration will be reorganized in NTS and LTS. SAT is&#13;
the headquarters for NTS, but also has responsibility for guiding LTS. As of July 1, 1994,&#13;
NTS collects all central taxes and shared taxes, amounting to the bulk of all taxes. The&#13;
split of NTS and LTS has now been enacted in all 30 provinces. NTS will retain about&#13;
350,000 personnel, the rest remaining in the local tax bureaus.&#13;
17.         With the help of technical assistance (TA) from the International Monetary&#13;
Fund (IMF), a reform strategy and an implementation plan have been drafted.4/ The&#13;
strategy for reforms rests on: (a) a gradual move to self-assessment; (b) increased reliance&#13;
on tax advisors outside the administration; (c) increased computerization; and (d) a&#13;
strengthening of taxpayer information. SAT has decided to reform its procedures and the&#13;
internal organization of the offices, in line with the core tax administration functions&#13;
(registration; collection and accounting; audit and inspection; and taxpayer's information).&#13;
The district level will be the focus of computerization, but in the long run, SAT plans a&#13;
national system, with city-level and national-level processing capacity as well.&#13;
18.         Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. The reforms in intergovemmental&#13;
fiscal relations will gradually increase central government's share in budgetary revenues.&#13;
The new system assigns most taxes to either central government or to local govemment.&#13;
The VAT and the Securities Trading Tax (to be introduced) are shared between central and&#13;
2/ However, the Energy and Transportation Tax, a tax on retained earnings, is abolished for SOEs but&#13;
not for nonstate enterprises.&#13;

of the Implementation Plan on Experimental Computerization of Tax Collection and Management."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
provincial government, with central shares of 75 and 50 percent, respectively. Offshore&#13;
resource taxes accrue to central government and other resource taxes to provincial&#13;
government. Central govemment's revenue share will gradually increase to about 60&#13;
percent of revenues, from about 40 percent in 1993. However, provinces are guaranteed&#13;
the 1993 level of revenues, and the new system will be gradually phased in, starting with&#13;
the increase in shared taxes over the 1993 level. The incremental revenues that will build&#13;
up at the central-government level is to be distributed to provincial governments by means&#13;
of a grant system. Until such a system is designed and approved, extra central revenues&#13;
from the VAT and Consumption Tax are in part returned to the provinces, predominantly&#13;
on a derivation basis.&#13;
19.         The State Council has established a Working Group to prepare a conceptual&#13;
design of a central-provincial grants scheme by June 1995. The Group, consisting of&#13;
MOF, Systems Reform Commission (SRC) and SAT officials, builds on technical&#13;
assistance by IMF, and is currently exploring a scheme that takes both revenue capacity&#13;
and expenditure needs into account. A "standard budget approach" used by Australia is&#13;
currently under study. The Group's efforts are supported by a Japanese Policy and Human&#13;
Resource Development (PHRD) grant, which finances regular visits of experts for&#13;
workshops on various aspects of the grants scheme design. After the State Council has&#13;
approved the conceptual design next year, the Budget Department of MOF is to develop&#13;
a detailed design, and will be responsible for implementation of the grants scheme.&#13;
20.         Budget Systems. An organic budget law was passed by the March 1994&#13;
NPC, codifying the 1991 budget regulation system. The law specifies a number of&#13;
principles and practices that may lead to a better allocation of public resources, and better&#13;
expenditure control. The law sets out the role and responsibilities of the various actors in&#13;
the budgetary process, codifies the new tax assignment and sharing system, and the&#13;
separation of central and local budgets, which de facto was already in place. The law only&#13;
allows borrowing for construction expenditures.  Since 1993, the central budget is&#13;
compiled according to the "dual budget" method, which divides the budget into a 'regular'&#13;
and "construction" budget. The PBC Law excludes overdrafts from PBC, a practice&#13;
already in place since the beginning of 1994. Local governments are, as before, not&#13;
allowed to borrow.&#13;
21.         Both the "dual budget" and the new intergovernmental fiscal relations require&#13;
fundamental changes in the budget accounting system. The "dual budget" reporting can&#13;
only be fully implemented if the accounting system corresponds with the "dual budget'&#13;
structure. The new intergovernmental fiscal relations put additional demands on the&#13;
information to be contained in the budget. The "standardized expenditure needs" basis of&#13;
the grants scheme requires adequate information on the costs of government programs,&#13;
which is at present hard to obtain from the budget.&#13;
22.         The preclusion from access to PBC financing increases the need for sound&#13;
and efficient treasury management, in order to minimize short-term debt obligations.&#13;
Improved treasury management would also be necessary to achieve the goals of expenditure&#13;
control as stated in the Budget Law. Finally, the new intergovernmental fiscal relations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
have led the State Council to the decision that central and local government treasuries in&#13;
PBC need to be separated.&#13;
2. PROJEcr OBJEcTIvEs AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
23.         The Government has asked the Bank Group and IMF for assistance in&#13;
implementing the current fiscal reforms and preparing future reforms. The project would&#13;
support the fiscal reforms by: (a) developing and implementing a new tax administration;&#13;
(b) strengthening capacity for tax policy analysis; (c) developing and implementing a&#13;
central-provincial grants scheme; and (d) improving budgetary processes and practices.&#13;
The project would contribute to improved management of public resources.&#13;
Tax Administration&#13;
24.         The tax administration component would support SAT with the development&#13;
and implementation of an NTS that is capable of implementing current and future tax&#13;
reforms.  The project would support the development and implementation of new&#13;
administrative procedures, organizational arrangements, and information systems. SAT's&#13;
implementation plan, developed with IMF assistance, calls for a phased implementation of&#13;
the reforms. During Phase I, the new tax administration will be tested on a pilot basis in&#13;
four cities (Beijing Haidan District, Wuxi, Xiaoshan, Shenyang). After a systems&#13;
assessment, the reforms will be rolled out to 14 other cities (Phase II). Subsequently, the&#13;
reforms would be implemented nationally, with over 200 cities planned to be in the NTS&#13;
network by the year 2000. The project will support Phases I and II. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained that no roll-out will take place before satisfactory systems&#13;
assessment, and implementation of agreed improvements.&#13;
25.         SAT has established a Steering Committee, and has drafted new procedures&#13;
and organizational arrangements for the tax administration, which were reviewed by the&#13;
appraisal mission, and are expected to be finalized by August 1995. On the basis of this,&#13;
an information systems design and architecture would be developed, supported by a PHRD&#13;
grant, and the project. Selection of a consulting firm that would assist SAT in systems&#13;
design is expected to be finalized by April 1995.&#13;
26.         The information systems would be developed and implemented in one&#13;
development site, Haidian District in Beijing. China's priorities for computerization are&#13;
the VAT, the EIT and the PIT. The PIT is a local tax, but SAT plans to use the&#13;
information system of the NTS to process data for local taxes with high dataprocessing&#13;
requirements (PIT and EIT for locally owned enterprises). A PHRD grant will finance&#13;
systems design and specification covering the requirements of a nationwide information&#13;
system, database structures, dictionaries and overall hardware architecture. SAT plans to&#13;
first implement functions more closely related to collection (registration, filing, accounting,&#13;
stopfiler detection, etc.), whereas at a later stage information systems for audit, audit&#13;
selection, and internal management would be implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
27.         A preliminary architecture of the system includes data processing capacity&#13;
at three levels:&#13;
(a)   District.  The district level would become the main operational level.&#13;
Databases and processing capacity for, among others, registration, filing,&#13;
collection, stopfiler control, accounting, refunds, and appeals would be&#13;
maintained at this level.&#13;
(b)   City.  The city-level databases would maintain summarized taxpayers'&#13;
records for audit, audit selection, and statistical reporting, and information&#13;
for internal management purposes.&#13;
(c)   National. The national-level database would contain summarized historical&#13;
time series and sample individual data for tax policy analysis, and&#13;
summarized data on the tax administration organization for management and&#13;
strategy development purposes.&#13;
28.         In small cities, SAT intends to experiment with data processing capacity&#13;
centralized at the city level. In this architecture, the districts would retain the taxpayer's&#13;
files and would access the city-based database with terminals.&#13;
29.         SAT has decided to opt for an "open systems" concept, portable among&#13;
hardware platforms, and expandable according to needs. The information system should&#13;
be able to accommodate likely changes in the tax administration, including changes in tax&#13;
policy, changes in organizational setup, number of taxpayers, and changes in tax&#13;
administration policies, procedures and controls. SAT intends to use CASE, Relational&#13;
Database Management Systems, UNIX, and a Standard Systems Development&#13;
Methodology.&#13;
30.         The project would support: (a) CS for tax administration procedures and&#13;
information systems development; (b) training in administrative and managerial functions&#13;
and in systems development; and (c) equipment for the information system.&#13;
31.         Consultancies. The CS will focus on tax administrative functions and on&#13;
the development and implementation of the computer systems design. The systems design&#13;
will predominantly be implemented by SAT personnel, with assistance from programmers&#13;
financed under the project, and under guidance from the technical advisor and the&#13;
electronic data processing (EDP) advisor.  Assistance will also be provided in the&#13;
procurement and installation of equipment. China's authorities have decided against&#13;
resident advisors and intend to obtain advice through regular short-term consultations. The&#13;
main experts expected to be financed under the project are:&#13;
(a)   The Technical Advisors who would advise SAT on all aspects of the&#13;
development of the new tax administration system. SAT would hire one&#13;
foreign and two local experts. The advisors would assist SAT in project&#13;
management, notably in supervision of the systems design consultants, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development of an installation plan for Phase I equipment and software, and&#13;
a roll-out plan for Phase II;&#13;
(b)   Systems Design Experts who would assist SAT in detailed design of the&#13;
data processing system;&#13;
(c)   Programmers who would assist SAT in construction of the data processing&#13;
system;&#13;
(d)   A Procurement Advisor who would assist SAT in the acquisition of hard-&#13;
and software for the new tax administration;&#13;
(e)   A Training Expert who would assist SAT in the development of a national&#13;
training plan, and on the development of key courses for the new tax&#13;
administration.&#13;
32.         Short-term CS will be financed for several management issues faced by&#13;
SAT, including personnel policy, cooperation with banks and Customs, and investment and&#13;
efficiency analysis for the tax administration.&#13;
33.         Training. Training will concentrate on those functions that are emphasized&#13;
by the new administrative procedures: audit and inspection; management and taxpayer's&#13;
information. SAT wants to build up local training capacity in those new functions, but&#13;
deems it necessary that local trainers for those functions be trained abroad. Information&#13;
technology (iT) training will strengthen SAT's in-house capacity for systems development,&#13;
implementation and maintenance. The project will also finance SAT's large training&#13;
program for new users of computers. A limited number of study tours would provide&#13;
comparative experience on some policy issues for the tax administration, including:&#13;
cooperation with banks and Customs; tax management systems, and city- and national-level&#13;
information systems; and tax enforcement measures. Several SAT staff will be seconded&#13;
to foreign tax administrations to obtain in-depth exposure to state-of-the-art-practices,&#13;
notably in audit, audit selection, and management.&#13;
34.         Equipment. Equipment and software acquisition will concentrate on the&#13;
district level, the main operational processing level.  City-level and national-level&#13;
computers would also be financed, as well as a district-level computer for one of SAT's&#13;
training schools.&#13;
Tax Policy Analysis&#13;
35.         China's authorities aim to improve China's tax policy analysis capacity in&#13;
order to perfect current tax reforms and to prepare future tax reforms. The tax policy&#13;
component will support this objective by: (a) improvements in the capacity for quantitative&#13;
tax policy analysis; (b) facilitating the gradual transfer of responsibility for tax policy&#13;
analysis from SAT to MOF; (c) the creation of tax policy analysis capacity at the&#13;
provincial level; and (d) the preparation of future tax reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
36.         The project expands the capacity for quantitative tax policy analysis by&#13;
improving the MOF enterprise survey and the State Statistical Bureau's (SSB) household&#13;
survey, making them more suited for tax policy analysis. The project would support&#13;
training in tax policy analysis for central government officials to enhance their capacity to&#13;
analyze the revenue impact of policy changes, and to conduct revenue forecasts. The more&#13;
advanced courses would be held overseas. The project would support the development of&#13;
an information system for the MOF-Tax Policy Department and the SAT Tax Policy and&#13;
Legislation Department for the processing of the survey data, and other policy-related data.&#13;
MOF staff would obtain IT training under the project.&#13;
37.         The project would support the gradual transfer of the tax policy function&#13;
from SAT to MOF. Currently, tax policy analysis is principally based within SAT, and&#13;
MOF comments on and clears SAT proposals on tax policy. The State Council has&#13;
recently assigned the tax policy formulation function to MOF, while SAT will concentrate&#13;
more on the administration of taxes. This division of labor is in line with intemational&#13;
experience. The project furthers this objective by supporting a number of joint studies in&#13;
tax policy, which would contribute to the transfer of knowledge from SAT to MOF, and&#13;
by financing training for MOF and SAT officials.&#13;
38.         Provinces have until now hardly any tax policy analysis capacity, as all&#13;
authority on tax rates and bases is vested in central govemment. With the emergence of&#13;
new intergovemmental fiscal arrangements, the authorities anticipate the need for increased&#13;
participation of subnational-level govemments in tax policy, and therefore for tax policy&#13;
analysis capacity at provincial level. The project would support this by financing training&#13;
in tax policy analysis for provincial-level assistance, and by providing personal computers&#13;
to each provincial-level fiscal authority for analysis, and for data collection for the national&#13;
survey. The project would finance studies on local taxes and tax assignment. Finance&#13;
Bureau staff would obtain IT training under the project.&#13;
39.         The joint MOF/SAT studies would refine the current reforms and prepare&#13;
for future tax reforms. Current reforms have moved China's tax system considerably in&#13;
the direction of a system suited for a market economy, but in several respects, the current&#13;
structure still requires adjustments. Moreover, early figures on 1994 tax collection suggest&#13;
that the current reforms will not increase the tax share in GNP, and future reforms would&#13;
seek a broadening of the tax base. The project would finance studies in the areas of: (a)&#13;
the VAT; (b) the EIT; (c) the PIT; (d) local taxes; (e) social security taxes; and (f)&#13;
environmental and resource taxes. The studies are part of the work plans of MOF and&#13;
SAT for the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The studies will be performed predominantly by&#13;
Chinese officials and researchers, but the project supports CS to provide the&#13;
methodological framework, assist in drafting outlines for the studies and control the quality&#13;
of the studies after draft final reports have been prepared.&#13;
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations&#13;
40.         China's authorities aim to develop and implement an efficient and equitable&#13;
central-provincial grants scheme that would, according to objective criteria, redistribute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
part of the increase in central government revenue to the provinces.   The&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal component supports this goal. The grants scheme is an essential&#13;
complement to the new revenue assignments. The authorities plan to implement the grants&#13;
scheme on a pilot basis in 1997. A date for nationwide implementation has not been&#13;
decided upon. Currently, the State Council Working Group is working on a conceptual&#13;
design for a grants scheme, an effort supported under a PHRD grant. Following the State&#13;
Council's approval of the conceptual design, the MOF Budget Department will assume the&#13;
responsibility for detailed implementation of the conceptual design. Implementation&#13;
requires a substantial effort in data gathering and analysis, and the training of people at&#13;
central- and provincial-level govemments.&#13;
41.         After the State Council Working Group produces the conceptual design, the&#13;
project will support detailed studies for the implementation of the grants scheme. This will&#13;
include the detailed norms and criteria on revenues and expenditures to be used in the&#13;
grants scheme, and the data and data reporting necessary to operationalize the grants&#13;
scheme. The project would support the pilot implementation of the grants scheme in&#13;
several provinces. The pilot would serve the development of administrative processes and&#13;
computer system to support the grants scheme. The project would support a number of&#13;
workshops to disseminate the results of the studies, to discuss the design of the pilot, and&#13;
to evaluate the plans for nationwide implementation. The project has earmarked resources&#13;
for nationwide implementation, once this has been decided upon by the State Council. The&#13;
project would finance extension of the computer system to all localities and a number of&#13;
seminars for the dissemination of the national grants scheme design.&#13;
42.         The project would support training at central and local level to enhance the&#13;
understanding of the grants scheme and to build implementation capacity. The project will&#13;
support a number of secondments of central officials to grants implementing agents in&#13;
various countries to provide MOF personnel with in-depth exposure to the day-to-day&#13;
administration of a grants scheme.&#13;
Budget System&#13;
43.         The Govemment aims to operationalize the 1994 Budget Law. The budget&#13;
systems component supports this goal by strengthening MOF's institutional capacity for&#13;
implementing reforms in the budget system. The component would enhance MOF's&#13;
understanding of best-practice budget procedures, practices and systems, and support the&#13;
formulation of a budget systems reform strategy appropriate for China.&#13;
44.        In a number of diagnostic studies, the budget systems component would&#13;
identify strengths and weaknesses in: (a) the budget accounting system; (b) treasury&#13;
management; (c) budget preparation and analysis; and (d) audit and inspection. The&#13;
studies would be performed primarily by Chinese officials assisted by foreign and local&#13;
consultants. In-country CS will be primarily provided in short-term consultations, to avoid&#13;
overburdening the key people within MOF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
45.          Study tours, training and international workshops would provide MOF with&#13;
exposure to best-practice budget systems. The international comparison and the diagnostic&#13;
studies would provide input for a budget systems reform strategy to be drafted by MOF.&#13;
The strategy would establish a long-run view for the development of an efficient budget&#13;
system that can support China's budgetary processes and practices. The strategy would&#13;
identify priority areas for implementation. Domestic workshops would disseminate and&#13;
discuss the findings of the studies.&#13;
46.          The project would also finance an expansion and improvement of the&#13;
existing treasury network of PBC. This high-priority investment would be done after an&#13;
assessment of the existing data processing system and implementation of agreed-on&#13;
improvements in software. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that no&#13;
procurement of equipment for the treasury network would be initiated before a systems&#13;
assessment has been implemented, and agreed improvements have been implemented.&#13;
3. PROJEcr COSTS AND FINANCaNG&#13;
47.          Total project base costs are estimated at about $88.2 million. Including&#13;
contingencies, total costs are estimated at $105.5 milion.5/ The base costs of the&#13;
various components are: (a) tax administration $76.3 million; (b) tax policy $4.8 million;&#13;
(c) intergovernmental fiscal relations $2.9 million; and (d) budget systems $4.3 million&#13;
(Table 2). Of the total base costs, 14.8 percent supports institutional development,&#13;
0.9 percent project implementation, 2.5 percent policy support, 45.4 percent automation,&#13;
and the remaining 36.3 percent consists of (five-year) incremental operating costs. In&#13;
terms of cost categories, 42.9 percent is devoted to equipment, 36.3 percent to incremental&#13;
operating costs, 6.2 percent to consultants' services, and 14.2 percent to training, seminars&#13;
and study tours. Detailed cost estimates can be found in Attachment 1.&#13;
48.          The Bank Group will finance 92 percent of foreign exchange costs, the&#13;
balance consisting of counterpart funding of computer equipment. The Bank Group will&#13;
finance 5.3 percent of local costs consisting of expenditures for CS. The total Bank Group&#13;
finance share is 47.4 percent. Two thirds of counterpart funding consists of incremental&#13;
operating costs for the investment in equipment.6/ Table 3 provides an overview of&#13;
financing arrangements; Attachment 1 provides a detailed financing plan.&#13;
4. OTHER DONOR ASSISTANCE&#13;
49.         In addition to the assistance provided by the project, IMR   and UNDP have&#13;
an ongoing TA program with SAT (about $400,000), under which advice on tax policy and&#13;
administration reforms is provided in specific areas, such as transfer pricing and VAT&#13;
S/  The current high domestic inflation in China inflates the domestic price contingencies in dollar terms,&#13;
as a constant nominal exchange rate is assumed in the calculations.&#13;
6/ The costs were estimated at 5 percent of the investment per year for PC-based systems, and 8 percent&#13;
for mini/medium-size computers. Five years of incremental operating costs were taken into account.&#13;

administration.  The content of the proposed project has been coordinated with this&#13;
program such that overlap is avoided. The tax administration reforms as pursued by SAT&#13;
rely heavily on IMF TA: IMF assisted SAT in developing a strategy and a draft&#13;
implementation plan. The Bank Group and IMF have closely cooperated in preparation,&#13;
will cooperate in the supervision of the tax administration component, and will closely&#13;
coordinate efforts in the other components (Section B5). IMF has provided TA to MOF&#13;
on grants design, the treasury function, and on budget nomenclature. The Asian&#13;
Development Bank (ADB) is financing a study on subprovincial finance in PY95.&#13;

50.           For overall project coordination, a project coordination team has been set&#13;
up, consisting of representatives from SAT and MOF. The MOF World Bank Department&#13;
will coordinate the project implementation team and will advise on Bank Group policies&#13;
and procedures.   The World Bank Department and the International Cooperation&#13;

of study tours and foreign training. Under the project implementation team, three separate&#13;
implementation teams have been established for: (a) tax administration; (b) tax policy; and&#13;
(c) intergovernmental fiscal relations and budget systems (Figure 1).&#13;

51.           SAT is responsible for implementation of the tax administration component.&#13;
SAT has installed a Steering Committee to lead the reform efforts, headed by the Chief&#13;
Economist. The Steering Committee will clear all major steps in the reform effort, among&#13;
which are: specification of administrative procedures, systems design and architecture,&#13;
systems assessment; roll-out plan; training plan; and project completion reports. The SAT&#13;
has appointed a Tax Administration Reform Office (TARO) responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
implementation of the tax administration reforms. Under TARO, various working groups&#13;
will be responsible for the implementation of parts of the project (Figure 2). TARO will&#13;
be advised by the technical advisors and by a procurement advisor.  A training&#13;
development expert would assist in the drafting of training plans, and training financed&#13;
under the project.&#13;

52.          The major milestones of the component, including timing, deliverables and&#13;
responsibilities have been agreed upon. The roll-out of the computer systems is now&#13;
expected to be completed by the end of 1996 (Attachment 5). Terms of Reference for key&#13;
activities have been agreed upon.&#13;
53.          The Tax Policy Department in MOF and the Tax Policy and Legislation&#13;
Department in SAT have set up a joint tax policy unit to administer the tax policy&#13;
component. The Unit is led by the Director of the MOF Tax Policy Department and the&#13;
Deputy Director of the SAT Tax Policy and Legislation Department. Local consultants&#13;
would assist the tax policy unit in the organization and programming of training, studies,&#13;
study tours, and seminars. TORs for each project activity have been submitted to the Bank&#13;
and were discussed during appraisal.&#13;
54.         The MOF Budget Department is responsible for the intergovernmental fiscal&#13;
component and the budget systems component. The Department has established a project&#13;
team to implement the component. The Department will cooperate with the PBC Treasury&#13;
Department and the State Audit Administration on the relevant subcomponents of the&#13;
budget systems component, and with SAT, SRC and SSB on relevant parts of the&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal component. Local consultants would assist in organization and&#13;
programming of studies, training, study tours, and seminars. Outline TORs for all project&#13;
activities were discussed during negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
55.         The Bank Group has obtained assurances that the Borrower will:&#13;
(a) maintain the project coordination team and the component implementation teams with&#13;
the resources necessary for smooth implementation of the project; and (b) adequately&#13;
maintain the equipment procured under the project. For this purpose, the Borrower would&#13;
sign maintenance contracts with qualified firms.&#13;
56.         For a detailed overview of the activities, the responsible agencies and&#13;
departments, and planned timing of the activities, see Attachment 4. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the project components will be implemented in accordance&#13;
with action plans acceptable to the Bank Group.&#13;
2. PRocuREmENT&#13;
57.         Consultant Services. Consultant services required for the project would be&#13;
procured in accordance with the World Bank guidelines "Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as an Executing Agency" (August 1981).&#13;
Contracts with firms of $100,000 and with individuals of $50,000 or more would be&#13;
subject to Bank Group prior review.&#13;
58.         Goods. Goods (equipment and materials) contracts above $200,000 will be&#13;
subject to the Bank Group's international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures as stated&#13;
in the 'Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995).&#13;
Contracts estimated to be $200,000 or less and $800,000 or less in the aggregate will be&#13;
subject to national competitive bidding (NCB) with procedures acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group, and contracts estimated to be $100,000 or less and $600,000 or less in the&#13;
aggregate would be subject to national shopping rules. For the procurement of equipment&#13;
and materials, Model Bidding Documents and standard contract documentation would be&#13;
used. A domestic preference for goods procured under ICB-15 percent of the CIF price,&#13;
or the actual tariff, whichever is less-will be allowed. All goods contracts over $200,000&#13;
would be subject to prior review.&#13;
59.         The equipment will be procured in phases. First, a development computer&#13;
and development software will be procured with the proceeds from a CRISSP subproject.&#13;
This would enable SAT to start developing the district system on the basis of the systems&#13;
design. Subsequently, an operational database management system would be procured by&#13;
ICB. This would allow SAT to start construction of the computer system before&#13;
acquisition of operational hardware. Then, equipment for the four cities would be&#13;
procured, with the 14 cities' expansion included as an option, leaving flexibility to adjust&#13;
hardware architecture after the first phase. SAT will be assisted by a procurement advisor&#13;
in preparing the procurement documents.&#13;

3. DLSBURsEMENT&#13;
60.           An approximate disbursement profile is given in Table 5.  Disbursements&#13;
would be made for: (a) goods at 100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local&#13;
expenditures (ex-factory) and 75 percent for other items procured locally; and&#13;
(b) consultants' services, training seminars, workshops and study tours at 100 percent of&#13;
expenditures. Disbursement against contracts for goods not exceeding $200,000 equivalent&#13;
and consultants' services performed by firms not exceeding $100,000 equivalent and for&#13;
consultant's services performed by individuals not exceeding $50,000 equivalent, training,&#13;
seminars, and study tours would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs). Retroactive financing of up to SDR 3.1 million, or about $4.5 million equivalent,&#13;
would be alowed for more urgent expenditures-among which Phase I equipment-paid&#13;
after March 1, 1995. Projected disbursements depend to a considerable extent on the roll-&#13;
out of the tax administration computer system. This roll-out, planned to be completed by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
1996, may be delayed due to unexpected difficulties in design, construction, and piloting&#13;
of that system. The projected disbursement is therefore somewhat slower than implied by&#13;
the timetable in Attachments 4 and 5. The closing date of the loan and the credit would&#13;
be December 31, 1999.&#13;

61.         MOF will establish a special account in a bank acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group, under conditions satisfactory to the Bank Group. The authorized allocation for the&#13;
Special Account is $5 million, which is somewhat higher than the usual four months of&#13;
average expenditures, because disbursements are concentrated in the first two years of the&#13;
project. Initial deposits amounting to $3 million equivalent will be made.&#13;
4. ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENT&#13;
62.         The project accounts and the special account would be maintained by the&#13;
MOF World Bank Department.  The project accounts, special account and the&#13;
documentation for SOEs would be subject to an annual audit by an independent auditor&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank Group. The audit reports, and separate opinions on SOEs and the&#13;
Special Accounts would be furnished to the Bank Group within six months of the end of&#13;
the Government's fiscal year.&#13;
5. MoNrroRiNG AND PROGRESS REPORTING&#13;
63.         For each project component, semiannual activity plans would be prepared&#13;
by the implementation team, and furnished to the Bank Group for discussion and&#13;
concurrence. Each work plan would include: planning on the subcomponents under&#13;
implementation, and the subcomponents under preparation; detailed description and terms&#13;
of reference for the components; and budget and expected disbursements for the&#13;
subcomponents.&#13;
64.         For the tax administration component, progress reports would be prepared&#13;
by the implementation team according to the Schedule in Attachment 5 and furnished to&#13;
the Bank Group. For the project as a whole, semiannual progress reports would be&#13;
prepared. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations. The complexity of the&#13;
tax administration component requires a higher frequency of progress reporting. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
reports would summarize progress on the subcomponents, including activities undertaken,&#13;
disbursements, output, and implementation issues. Key indicators for monitoring progress&#13;
in the activities, as well as the various reports to be produced are summarized in&#13;
Attachments 4 and 5.&#13;
65.         Output and Impact Indicators. For tax administration, output indicators&#13;
would be: (a) the implementation of the new procedures, organizational arrangements and&#13;
the new information system in the 18 project sites; and (b) the number of people trained.&#13;
The impact of the tax administration reforms would be measured by improvements in&#13;
efficiency indicators, among which: (i) number of taxpayer registrations and returns&#13;
processed per employee; (ii) number of taxpayers' questions answered, and average&#13;
response time; (iii) speed of assembling daily, monthly and annual reports; and (iv)&#13;
average tax collection per employee.&#13;
66.         For the Tax Policy Component, the main output indicators would be: (a) the&#13;
implementation of the revised enterprise survey; (b) the completion of the studies; and&#13;
(c) the number of people trained. The final impact indicator would be a broadening of&#13;
the tax base and an improvement of the tax structure. This impact, however, largely&#13;
depends on political decisions, which fall outside the control of the implementing agencies.&#13;
67.         For the Intergovernmental Fiscal Component, output indicators are:&#13;
(a) completion of the studies for grants design; (b) number of people trained; and&#13;
(c) discussion seminars completed. The main impact indicator would be the national&#13;
introduction of an efficient and equalizing grants scheme. This, however, again depends&#13;
primarily on a political decision to implement the grants scheme developed under the&#13;
project.&#13;
68.         For the Budget Systems Component, the main output indicators are: (a) the&#13;
completion of the diagnostic studies; (b) expansion of an improved treasury network in one&#13;
or two provinces; and (c) the number of people trained. Impact indicators would be the&#13;
implementation of the recommendations made in the diagnostic studies.&#13;
6. SUPERVISION&#13;
69.         Supervision of the project would require an estimated 16 staff-weeks per&#13;
year, excluding IMF staff. In the first year, the supervision of the tax administration&#13;
component will require more than proportional attention, due to the various critical&#13;
decisions on hiring and procurement to be made. Supervision missions for the whole&#13;
project will be fielded three times a year for the first two years, and semiannually&#13;
afterwards (see Attachment 7 for further detail).&#13;
70.         The Bank Group and IMF will continue close cooperation in the supervision&#13;
of the project. The IMF plans to assist the Bank Group in supervising the substantive&#13;
aspects of tax administration and systems design and implementation. The Bank Group&#13;
would retain overall supervision responsibility, including procurement and disbursements.&#13;

7. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOus BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT&#13;
71.         Bank Group and IMF involvement in tax administration projects suggests&#13;
three key factors for success: (a) high political commitment; (b) a clear reform strategy;&#13;
(c) a strong implementation team; and (d) use of pilot project to test new systems and&#13;
procedures before nationwide implementation. This experience also shows that procedural&#13;
and organizational change should precede computerization, and that self-assessment&#13;
combined with effective audit techniques and proper administration-intemal resource&#13;
allocation provides for the most efficient tax administration.&#13;
72.         Bank Group experience in budget systems reforms shows that such reforms&#13;
require a long lead time, and that a clear strategy for a revised budget system should&#13;
precede implementation of reforms.&#13;
73.         The Bank Group has no previous project experience in the field of fiscal&#13;
management in China, but there have been seven technical assistance projects: two&#13;
Technical Cooperation Projects (Cr. 1412-CHA, Cr. 1664-CHA), a Planning Support and&#13;
Special Studies Project (Cr. 1835-CHA), a Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment&#13;
Project (Cr. 2447-CHA), a Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2423-CHA),&#13;
an Environmental Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2522-CHA) and an Economic Law&#13;
Reform Project (Cr. 2654-CHA). Among the lessons leamed are the need for: (a)&#13;
political commitment to the goals of the operation; (b) preidentification of sufficient&#13;
subproject activities; (c) avoidance of excessive financing of hardware and overseas&#13;
training; and (d) a firm implementation plan, including onlending arrangements between&#13;
MOF and the beneficiary agencies.&#13;
74.         The political commitment to fiscal reforms is high, as witnessed by The&#13;
Decisions of November 1993.  The hardware acquisition is predominantly in tax&#13;
administration, and is firmly supported by the overall reform strategy in that area, which&#13;
aims to revise procedures and organization before new computer systems are developed.&#13;
SAT's Steering Committee and implementation team, supplemented by advisors, provide&#13;
a guarantee for implementation of the tax administration component. The budget systems&#13;
component aims to develop a long-term strategy for budget system and to build the&#13;
capacity to implement such reforms. The appraisal mission has agreed on design and&#13;
implementation of overseas training and study tours that ensures their quality and impact.&#13;
Most project activities had been identified in preparation, and most TORs were discussed&#13;
at appraisal.  The structure of the implementation teams guarantees the necessary&#13;
coordination among agencies. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Borrower&#13;
will allocate the loan/credit proceeds to the various implementing agencies free of charge.&#13;
8. RATIONALE FOR BANK/IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
75.         The implementation of fiscal and tax reforms is a high priority for China's&#13;
government, and the Minister of Finance has directly asked the Bank Group and IMF to&#13;
support the proposed project. Fiscal reforms are central to the Bank's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy, in which implementation of macroeconomic reforms is one of the primary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
objectives. Improved fiscal management would serve as a catalyst for reforms in other&#13;
sectors such as banking and SEs, because with increased and better-managed resources&#13;
these sectors can be relieved of government functions. A more equitable distribution of&#13;
fiscal resources would contribute to poverty reduction. In addition, increased fiscal&#13;
resources in poor provinces would relieve some of the shortage of counterpart funds for&#13;
Bank Group projects in those provinces.&#13;
76.         The Government's reform program corresponds closely with the Bank&#13;
Group's recommendations in economic and sector work, and policy dialogue. The tax&#13;
administration and intergovernmental fiscal components directly address implementation&#13;
of the reforms initiated in 1994. The budget systems and the tax policy component support&#13;
preparation of reforms in areas where further improvements could still be made. The tax&#13;
policy component aims at rationalization and broadening of the tax base, and the budget&#13;
systems component prepares reforms that would increase the efficiency of government&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
9. PRoJEcT BENEFr&#13;
77.         The project would:  (a) contribute to increased efficiency in revenue&#13;
generation and government expenditure; (b) enhance the productivity of the tax&#13;
administration and reduce burdens on the taxpayer; (c) increase the efficiency of the tax&#13;
structure; (d) improve the equitable distribution of government resources among provinces;&#13;
and (e) improve allocation of budget resources.  Total project costs are less than&#13;
0.2 percent of annual tax collection, and about 2 percent of collection in the districts&#13;
directly financed under the project. Thus, only a marginal improvement in collection&#13;
efficiency would make the project financially viable.&#13;
10. AGREEMENTS OBTAINED AT NEGOTIATIONS&#13;
78.         During negotiations, the Bank Group obtained agreements with the Borrower&#13;
on: (a) a proper phasing and a realistic planning in the tax administration reforms (para.&#13;
24); (b) systems assessment and improvements before procurement of equipment for the&#13;
PBC treasury (para. 46); (c) the Borrower will allocate the credit/loan proceeds to the&#13;
various implementing agencies free of charge (para. 74); (d) the modalities of project&#13;
management, implementation and monitoring (paras. 55, 56, and 64); and (e) adequate&#13;
maintenance of equipment procured under the project (para. 55).&#13;
11. RISKS&#13;
79.         The Government is very anxious to reform the tax administration quickly,&#13;
and SAT may be pressured to rush the implementation of the project. This risk will be&#13;
addressed by agreements at negotiations with SAT on a realistic timetable, and by&#13;
agreements on the phased project design, which requires satisfactory implementation of one&#13;
phase before activities for the next phase are implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
80.         Poor coordination among participating Chinese agencies may delay&#13;
implementation. The structure of the implementation teams would serve as a means to&#13;
resolve potential conflict among these agencies, and minimize the risk.&#13;
81.         A third risk lies in overburdening key officials in MOF and SAT. This has&#13;
been reduced by hiring local consultants under the project to supplement the staff of the&#13;
participating agencies, and by phasing the activities over time.&#13;
82.         A final risk lies with the possibility that SAT implements the computer&#13;
system without following up on the associated reforms in tax administration procedures.&#13;
Policy dialogue during implementation of the project will emphasize the importance of the&#13;
latter, and thus minimize this risk.&#13;

ATTACIHMENT 6&#13;
TRAINIG PLAN&#13;
1.          The project includes a comprehensive training component to strengthen the&#13;
institutional capacity of SAT, NTS in the 18 project locations, MOF, and the provincial-&#13;
level Finance and Tax Bureaus. The training program would provide specialized training&#13;
and training for trainers abroad, and would provide training for operational staff in-&#13;
country. In addition, a number of secondments would be financed under the project to&#13;
provide in-depth exposure to best practices in tax administration, budget management and&#13;
grants administration for key individuals of SAT and MOF. No degree training is planned&#13;
under the project.&#13;
2.          Tax Administration. The training under this component emphasizes new&#13;
functions in the tax administration, such as taxpayers' services, information management,&#13;
and auditing. In these fields, future trainers would be educated abroad. The trainers would&#13;
not only be used for the 18 project sites, but also are expected to play a central role in the&#13;
expansion of the NTS nationwide. In addition, training in computer systems design and&#13;
implementation would enhance SAT's in-house capacity to further develop and implement&#13;
the information system, which would enhance sustainability of the new NTS.&#13;
3.          Domestic training would include the training of all personnel of the project&#13;
sites. All computer operators would be trained in computer applications; tax administration&#13;
personnel would be trained in the skills required by the new functional organization of the&#13;
NTS bureaus (Registration, taxpayers' services, filing, collection and accounting, audit,&#13;
appeals).&#13;
4.          SAT would be responsible for the design of the training, assisted by the&#13;
Bank Group and IMF; the International Cooperation Department would be responsible for&#13;
organization of the training abroad, and the Training Department would be responsible for&#13;
domestic training. Domestic training would be delivered at the various training schools&#13;
and colleges of SAT, by full-time trainers, and by operational tax administrators. Foreign&#13;
training would be contracted out to specialized organizations, such as OECD's Training&#13;
Network for Tax Officials; IMF; Tax Consultants, and development institutes at&#13;
universities. Training in systems design would be contracted out to the consulting firm that&#13;
supports SAT in systems design; and computer application courses would be provided by&#13;
the hardware vendor. A timetable for the training activities, including estimates of the&#13;
number of officials to be trained, is included in Attachment 4. Outline curricula for the&#13;
training courses were developed by SAT before negotiations, and are available in the&#13;
project files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -                      Attachment 6&#13;
5.          Tax Policy. The training under this component aims to strengthen tax policy&#13;
analysis capacity of MOF, SAT and Finance Bureau officials. Basic tax policy analysis&#13;
courses, predominantly aimed at provincial-level officials, would be provided domestically.&#13;
More specialized courses in tax policy analysis, predominantly aimed at central-level&#13;
officials, would be held abroad.&#13;
6.          The Tax Policy Unit of SAT and MOF would be responsible for the design&#13;
of the training courses, assisted by the Bank Group. At negotiations, it was agreed that&#13;
the Bank Group would provide the Tax Policy Unit with a list of institutions that would&#13;
be capable of providing the required training. The international cooperation departments&#13;
of MOF and SAT, and the World Bank Department of MOF would be responsible for&#13;
implementation of the training abroad. The domestic training would be held at training&#13;
colleges of MOF and SAT. Most foreign training would be contracted out to specialized&#13;
institutions such as various development institutes and tax consultant firms. Outline&#13;
curricula for the courses were developed by TPU before negotiations, and are available in&#13;
the project files.  Approximate timetables for the training courses are included in&#13;
Attachment 4.&#13;
7.          Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. The training for this component aims&#13;
to strengthen the capacity for grants systems development and implementation. A number&#13;
of senior-level training courses abroad in intergovernmental fiscal relations would enhance&#13;
the absorptive capacity of Chinese officials for the studies financed under the project, and&#13;
the capacity to further develop the designs to Chinese circumstances. A series of domestic&#13;
seminars would, besides disseminating the grants design developed, increase understanding&#13;
of intergovernmental fiscal issues at subnational level. Five staff would be seconded to&#13;
foreign institutions administering a grants scheme, in order to obtain in-depth exposure to&#13;
best practice operation of a grants scheme.&#13;
8.          The MOF budget department will be responsible for the design of the&#13;
training courses, assisted by MOF World Bank Department, and the Bank Group. At&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed that the Bank Group would provide MOF with a list of suitable&#13;
institutions for training. The international cooperation and the World Bank Department&#13;
would be responsible for the implementation of the foreign training. Domestic training&#13;
would be held at various training facilities of MOF and provincial finance bureaus.&#13;
Foreign training would be supplied by specialized institutions with extensive experience&#13;
in teaching in public policy and intergovernmental fiscal issues. Universities and institutes&#13;
in countries with operating grants schemes, such as Australia, Canada, and Germany would&#13;
likely be most suited. Outline curricula for the training courses have been submitted by&#13;
the MOF Budget Department, and are available in the project files. An approximate&#13;
timetable for the training activities, including the expected number of beneficiaries, is&#13;
included in Attachment 4.&#13;
9.          Budget Systems. The training under this component aims to build the&#13;
institutional capacity necessary to implement reforms in budgetary management. Key&#13;
individuals at central government level would be trained abroad in a broad area of&#13;
budgetary management. Subnational-level officials would be trained domestically in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                      Attachment 6&#13;
same area. Domestic seminars would, in addition to disseminating the results of the&#13;
studies prepared under the component, expose Finance Bureau officials to key issues in&#13;
budgetary management.&#13;
10.        The MOF Budget Department would be responsible for the design of the&#13;
training courses, assisted by the MOF World Bank Department and the Bank Group. At&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed that the Bank Group would provide MOF with a list of suitable&#13;
institutions for training. The MOF International cooperation department and the World&#13;
Bank department would be responsible for the implementation of overseas training. The&#13;
overseas training would be contracted out to institutions and consultant firms with a wide&#13;
experience in training for budgetary management. Outline curricula for the training&#13;
courses were provided by MOF before negotiations, and are available in the project files.&#13;
Attachment 4 provides a preliminary timing for the training activities.&#13;

            The Fiscal Technical Assistance Project
            will assist in implementing the current fiscal reforms and
            preparing future reforms. The project will support the
            fiscal reforms by: (a) developing and implementing a new tax
            administration; (b) strengthening capacity for tax policy
            analysis; (c) developing and implementing a
            central-provincial grants scheme; and (d) improving
            budgetary process and practices. The project will contribute
            to improved management of public resources.
