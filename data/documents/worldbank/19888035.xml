                     THE CHAIRMAN:   The first meeting is a Bank meeting,&#13;
         and the first item of business is the proposed loan to the&#13;
         Indian Iron and Steel Compan7.&#13;
                     I would like to call on Mr. Ma.eon.&#13;
                     MR. MASON:   Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, steel was&#13;
         produced in India before World War I by Tata Iron and Steel&#13;
         Company, and soon after it the Indian Iron and Steel Company&#13;
         works came into production.      Since that time production at&#13;
         both these privately owned companies has risen steadily.&#13;
                     Since the Second World War two extensive moderniza-&#13;
         tion and expansion schemes have been put into effect at both&#13;
         Tata Iron and Steel and Indian Iron and Steel.          In each case&#13;
         they have been aided by loans from the Bank.         The two loans&#13;
         to Tata add up to $107.5 million, and those to Indian Iron and&#13;
         Steel total $51-5 million.&#13;
                     The present capacity of finished steel for the two&#13;
         companies is now 2.3 million tons per annum -- 1.5 million&#13;
         tons at Tata and 800,000 tons at Indian       Iro~   and Steel.   Until&#13;
         recently this accounted for practically all of Indiats steel&#13;
         production.&#13;
                     During the Second Five-Year Plan -- that is, from&#13;
         April 1956 until April 1961 -- the Government undertook the&#13;
         construction of three steel mills in the public sector which&#13;
         toget~er   would also have a capacity of 2.3 million tons.        The&#13;
&amp;#12;             ll&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                  4&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
         doubling or finished steel capacity in such a short time is&#13;
                  an ambitious task for any country, and the pace of this&#13;
                  development, superimposed on the simultaneous growth of other&#13;
&#13;
                  heavy industries, has so increased the demand for nigh-quality&#13;
                  coal that the insufficiency of its supply had threatened to&#13;
&#13;
                  become an obstacle to the achievement of the target set in the&#13;
&#13;
                  Third Plan.&#13;
                              As you are aware, the Bank has already made a loan&#13;
&#13;
                  of $35 million to the Government for the import of equipment&#13;
&#13;
                  needed for the expansion of the private coal eector, and with&#13;
&#13;
                  this help we believe the private coal mining sector will be&#13;
                  able to reach its planned expansion of 17 million tons of coal&#13;
&#13;
                  by the end of the Plan, of which 6 million tons ts to be cokin&#13;
&#13;
                  coal.   Nevertheless, the private collieries will be ha.rd&#13;
                  pressed by the demands of industry, particularly for this good&#13;
&#13;
                  quality coal.&#13;
&#13;
                              In the meantime the Government has given priority&#13;
                  to the movement    or   coal to the steel mills, but ha.a not been&#13;
                  able to assure its quality and uniformity, in large part&#13;
                  due to the delay in building coal washer1es.       Thi~   had&#13;
                  adversely affected Indian Iron and Steel Companyrs production&#13;
                  of steel.     It is thus fortunate that the company has coal&#13;
&#13;
                  mines of good quality coal which can be developed near enough&#13;
         I&#13;
&#13;
         I to        make it economical to bring 1t by ropeway directly from&#13;
         I the        mine to the works.      Hence, when this project is completed&#13;
&amp;#12;          r&#13;
                                                                              5&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
         Indian Iron and Steel will be able to supply its coke ovene&#13;
              with a uniform quality or high-grade coal which will not only&#13;
              reduce the amount of coking coal required but enable Indian&#13;
              Iron and Steel to maintain production of steel at a high level.&#13;
                        This would be the Bank's fourth loan to India fer&#13;
              projects in the first two years of the Third Five-Year Plan.&#13;
              It will bring the total to $125.5 million out of the total or&#13;
         I $200 million in loans which the President indicated he would&#13;
          i&#13;
&#13;
          jpreeent to you.     Bank loans in toto to India now amount to&#13;
              about $800 million.   The five credite approved by the Inter-&#13;
&#13;
              national DeÂ·:elopment Association amount to $88.5 million.&#13;
                        The provisions of the Loan anc Guarantee Agreements&#13;
&#13;
              follow cloeely the pattern set in the previous two loans to&#13;
              Indian Iron and Steel.&#13;
                        Apart from the eections which are mentioned in the&#13;
              Presidentta report, you will note that this loan will be&#13;
              secured by a first fixed mortgage and a f1ret floating charge&#13;
              upon all the properties of the company.   You will also see that&#13;
              one of the conditions of effectiveness -- that is in Section&#13;
              8.0l{c) Â·- is that the Bank ah.all be satisfied that the&#13;
              Borrower will be able to acquire all land, interests in land,&#13;
              properties, adequate electric power supply, and all such rights,&#13;
&#13;
              priv:tlege! and franchises as shall be necessary to carry out&#13;
              the project.   The company has already taken action in all these&#13;
              matters, and we believe that their completion, thougn dependent&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                               6&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
         in many cases on other parties, should not unduly delay the&#13;
              Bank in making this loan effective.&#13;
                        THE CHAIRMAN:     Thank you, sir.&#13;
                        Mr. Wright.&#13;
                        MR. WRIGHT:     Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, as you will&#13;
              recall, India t:s Second Five-Year Plan ended last March, and&#13;
              she is now nearly three quarters of the way through the first&#13;
&#13;
              year of her Third Plan.&#13;
                        Changes in Indiate national income still depend&#13;
              primarily on the course of agricultural production.     The last&#13;
              year of the Second Plan saw a record food grains harveet,&#13;
              and preliminary indications are that the present year will&#13;
              aleo be a good one for agriculture.     Rainfall during the&#13;
              summer monsoon was abundant and fairly well distributed over&#13;
&#13;
         1    the country.&#13;
          1&#13;
                        Industrial production has continued to rise at the&#13;
              rate of around    10 percent a year.   The latest official data&#13;
              relate to the month of July, and in the three months from&#13;
          ' May to July this year the over-all index was 8 percent higher&#13;
              than in the corresponding months of 1960.     This increase was&#13;
              achieved in spite of a decline in textile production, which&#13;
              accounts for nearly half the total weight of the index of&#13;
              production.    Thus, the production increases in the newer&#13;
              industries, particularly engineering and chemicals, have been&#13;
&#13;
              much greater than the average.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    7&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                Industrial production would have risen faster but&#13;
          for the continued shortages of fuel and power and transport.&#13;
         Â·The railways     rem~in   under heavy   pre~sure.   Shortage of power&#13;
         Â· has been a tbreat and remains one of the most serious obstacles&#13;
          to industrial expansion during the Third Plan.&#13;
                       The raw material position is rather difficult to&#13;
          asseseo      Clearly, some industries are being held back by&#13;
          shortages of imported materials, and this is one factor making&#13;
          for under-utilization of existing industrial capacity.              But&#13;
          there is no conclusive evidence to show that the situation has&#13;
          gotten worFe during the past year.&#13;
                        Imports as a whole during the current year -- that&#13;
          is, the Indian fiscal year 1961-1962            are expected to be&#13;
          coniiderably smaller than forecast a year ago.           Such increases&#13;
          as have occurred appear to be mainly in capital goods, and the&#13;
          level of maintenance imports ie hardly any higher than in&#13;
          1960-61.&#13;
                       Exports have done a little better this year.           In the&#13;
&#13;
          five months April to September 1961, receipts were about&#13;
          $70 million.     That is 10 percent higher than in the       sa~e&#13;
&#13;
          period of 1960.     Country-wise the largest increases have been&#13;
&#13;
          in exports to the United States and Japan.          Commo~ity-wise&#13;
          the   ~ain   increases have been in jute textiles, raw cotton, and&#13;
          sugar.&#13;
&#13;
                       In so far as the increase ln the value of jute export&#13;
&amp;#12;         '1&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   8&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
         is attributable entirely to the higher cost of raw jute,&#13;
         1&#13;
          1 the picture is not altogether encouraging.          Iron ore exports&#13;
         '&#13;
               have increased less than they should, mainly because of&#13;
         I&#13;
         I shortage of rail transport, and the trends of exports of&#13;
         l vegetable     oils and cotton textiles have both been disappointing.&#13;
                         The figures of foreign exchange reserves on&#13;
&#13;
               November 24 have been given in the President's Report.         Betwee~&#13;
&#13;
               that date and December 9 there was a very small increase,&#13;
&#13;
               bringing the total reserve bank's holdings, by a remarkable&#13;
               coincidence, to $555.555 million.&#13;
                         In spite of a net addition of $122.5 million to&#13;
               India's resources, resulting from transactions with the&#13;
         i''   Monetary Fund during the summer, no significant increase&#13;
               in foreign exchange    holding~   can be expected during the curren&#13;
               year, and there could be a slight fall.&#13;
                         The present year has seen a welcome pause in the&#13;
&#13;
               persistent upward trend of pricea.       At the end of November tbe&#13;
               official index of wholesale prices was 1-1/2 percent lower tha&#13;
               at the same time a year ago.&#13;
                         The increase in money supply during the past 12&#13;
               months, a little over 5 percent, haf: been moarate in relation&#13;
               to the growth of production.      The favorable agricultural&#13;
&#13;
               out-turn and the marked reduction in deficit financing by&#13;
               the Government have both contributed to greater internal&#13;
               financial stability.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          9&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                               The investment programs in the Third Plan are now&#13;
                     getting under way, but progress is uneven.        It can be expected&#13;
                     that the execution of the Plan will fall eome way behind the&#13;
&#13;
                     original timetable.   Nevertheless, solid      progres~   is being&#13;
&#13;
                     made, and although periodical checks must be expected the&#13;
&#13;
                     proepect le for continued expansion.&#13;

&#13;
                     despite the efforts being made by the pI'ivate coal sector to&#13;
                     increase production of coking coal by at least 6 millton tons&#13;
                     during the Third Five-Year Plan, there is a good poas1b111ty&#13;

                Contributing to the problem of supply of coking coal&#13;
               to the industry has been the delay in the installation of coal&#13;

              i&#13;

         arrangement should be changed.             On the other hand, the terms&#13;
&#13;
           which might be suitable for a firm might not necesearlly be&#13;
               suitable for a country, or the country in which the project is&#13;
&#13;
               located.&#13;
                          As I understand the situation, India has a very&#13;
               heavy external debt burden.       I have heard it said that it is&#13;
&#13;
          . past the danger point.        I am wondering, therefore, whether con-&#13;
          ':sideration had been given to making arrangements whereby as&#13;
&#13;
           ,far as the firm is concerned these terms would be maintained,&#13;
          1&#13;
          11&#13;
          1~ut    as far as India the country ls concerned it would be some-&#13;
          1~hat     more liberal.&#13;
           I&#13;
           I&#13;
           I&#13;
                          or   course, I am thinking of the type of arrangements ,&#13;
           I&#13;
           rhich have been made in the case of IDA credits.&#13;
           '&#13;
           I              It may be that part of the anser is the five-year&#13;
           I&#13;
           period of grace, and I would like some information on this.&#13;
           l&#13;
           ~llre is a five-year period of grace, and it may be that the&#13;
           I&#13;
           I&#13;
&#13;
           peak of the external debt burden will have been passed and&#13;
           i&#13;
           Indiants foreign exchange will have increased substantially.&#13;
&#13;
                          I am wondering if this type of consideration entered&#13;
           '&#13;
           '&#13;
           iinto your recommendation that the loan should be for 12 years&#13;
          l~nd     include f1 ve years of grace.&#13;
           I&#13;
                          THE CHAIRMAN:    Well, I would say that the points you&#13;
               ring up are very     import~nt   and are things that we very care-&#13;
           !&#13;
           rully considered, and they have a very important bearing on our I&#13;
                                                                                        I&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          we think we ought to keep the two separate. We feel in a&#13;
                project that the Bank finances the amortization schedule should&#13;
                be geared to the project.&#13;
                             Now, if a country has serious balance of payments&#13;
&#13;
                problems and very heavy debt problems, that means they would&#13;
                be eligible for IDA, or very likely be eligible for IDA.           But&#13;
          Â·1&#13;
          11&#13;
          !i we think it would be a rather dangerous precedent to start&#13;
          11&#13;
          11    in gearing all your Bank loans to the needs of the country and&#13;
          l&#13;

           I                 MR. KNAPP:    No, I don't think so, but I think it has&#13;
           i&#13;
          j! to be looked at in a broader perspective.          This is just one&#13;
           I&#13;
&#13;
           l    part of the whole pattern of Bank-IDA financing for India.&#13;
            '&#13;
           ': It is true you would have to distort this case from our normal&#13;
                project sÂ·tandarde to meet the Indian creditworthinese picture,&#13;
&#13;
                but we just didn't think we ought to do it.&#13;
                             THE CHAIRMAN:    I think what you are talking about,&#13;
           i Mr.&#13;
           I&#13;
                       Hudon, is that we would have to review the whole policy of&#13;
           ) the Bank and just disregard the project approach as far as the&#13;
           l'&#13;
           I schedule of payments         is concerned, but I think it is important&#13;
           I when a country has a         heavy volume of payments to make that&#13;
&#13;
          I is     when you start thinking about IDA.       Tb.at is what IDA is&#13;
           I&#13;
                for.    But you would have to change the whole procedure and&#13;
&#13;
                policy of the Bank if you are going to just fit each loan to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              14&#13;

                I&#13;

                1       thinking in terms of differentiating the project from the&#13;

                    I&#13;
                    I&#13;
                                   I   haven't analyzed it in the detail that you have,&#13;
                 I                                                                                 !&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          of the firm, and this is reasonable-Â· in those terms, and I&#13;
&#13;
                    think that that financial discipline should be maintained&#13;
&#13;
                    at all times.&#13;
&#13;
                                 I was just wondering whether any consideration&#13;
&#13;
                    whatsoever had been given to differentiating between the&#13;
&#13;
                    project itself and the country.&#13;
&#13;
                                 THE CHAIRMAN:   Well, that is one of the reasons for&#13;
&#13;
            J       the creation of IDA.      That's one of the real reasons for that.&#13;
&#13;
           1'       But if you started gearing your amortization schedule to the&#13;
&#13;
          i         country and not to the project you would have to change the&#13;

            I&#13;
                                 MR. MASON:   I think the difference between the two&#13;
&#13;
                    is that this was one way of considering the one we are&#13;
&#13;
                    considering now, Iron and Steel, for a specific project in&#13;
&#13;
                    which we were easily able to calculate whether it could pay&#13;

                I up    our minds to take a rounded sum between the usefulness&#13;
                I&#13;
                I and      the numbe' of collieries and that kindof thing.&#13;

                  was the postponement for five years or six years?&#13;
&#13;
                            MR. MASON:     Well, it was really to help them over&#13;
                  the Plan, in a way.    It was also as I say because there lere&#13;
&#13;
                  new mines that wouldn't come into operation until that time.&#13;
&#13;
                            THE CHAIRMAN:     But it was partly because of the&#13;

        Ii is a very excellent project.             In fact, fran its technical&#13;

            I point of view it seems to be one of the best that I personally&#13;
            l&#13;
&#13;

             1                                                                         \&#13;

        i!                  I just wondered in reading the detailed report whethtr&#13;

                                                                                       i&#13;
                                                                                       I&#13;

             . are made about expected returns, despite the technical and&#13;
&#13;
             i conceptual difficulties of that kind of thing, and here is&#13;
             I something    that is obviously much more straightforward and            I&#13;
                                                                                       i&#13;
             I                                                                         l&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                             17&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
               report it certainly looks like an extremely good investment,&#13;
&#13;
               good from the private point of view and good from the public&#13;
&#13;
               point of view, too.   But if in fact some calculations have&#13;
&#13;
               been made about the expected return or some idea has been&#13;
&#13;
               obtained of what this might yield, and if as I rather suspect&#13;
&#13;
               this return is quite a significant one, again judging from&#13;
&#13;
               the technical advantages of this scheme -- whether there&#13;
&#13;
               has been any consideration given to the possibility of raising&#13;
&#13;
               private finance for it.    I know there have been previous loans&#13;
        I; made in similar circumstances, but as I say I think this is a&#13;
          1&#13;
        1&#13;
        I'&#13;
        Ii&#13;
               point that did occur to me in reading this, and -- this is&#13;
        Iiii&#13;
               the opposite of the suggestion raised by Mr. Hudon -- whether&#13;
          I&#13;
               IFC had been thought of at all in this context.&#13;
&#13;
                         I am asking a lot of questions more for elucidation,&#13;
&#13;
               and as I say I think this sounds on the whole as presented to&#13;
&#13;
               us an excellent project which will benefit the company and&#13;
&#13;
               also India very greatly.&#13;
&#13;
                         THE CHAIRMAN:    Well, I will answer the last two&#13;
&#13;
               questions myself.&#13;
&#13;
                         First cf all, I don't think the time is yet ripe to&#13;
&#13;
            ' be able to float a loan like this in the private market.       We&#13;
         I:, are constantly thinking about that and checking with the&#13;
&#13;
               private market, but I don't think the time is quite ready&#13;
&#13;
               yet for that.&#13;
&#13;
                         As far as IFC is concerned, this is just too big.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           18&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             This is $19 million.    I   think if it was a smaller project it&#13;
             would certainly be a very attractive one for IFC.&#13;
&#13;
                       I think that some day -- it may not be too far&#13;
&#13;
             off -- that a company like the India Iron and Steel Company,&#13;
&#13;
             which is an extremely well managed company -- it would be&#13;
&#13;
             possible to float a loan in the private market, and this is&#13;
&#13;
             something that we talk about.      As a matter of fact, I think&#13;
             it might be possible if you had a company like this, the&#13;
&#13;
             Indian Iron and Steel or Tata Steel, to float a loan in the&#13;
&#13;
             private market either here or abroad if it would be possible&#13;
&#13;
        I&#13;
        1,&#13;
             to make it a convertible issue.      In other words, if you had&#13;
        I:&#13;
        Ji   some kick to it, either that the bonds that were to be offered:&#13;
        11&#13;
             had a conversion of the stock or you had an option to buy&#13;
        1:&#13;
             stock or something of that kind.&#13;
        1!&#13;
&#13;
                       I can assure you we are thinking about this all the&#13;
        Ii&#13;
             time, and the minute we feel that the market wou-ld take this&#13;
        11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         I kind of an offering we will certainly go into it.        It may be&#13;
        I&#13;
        '    that sometime 1n the future the Indian Iron and Steel Company l&#13;
                                                                                l&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;

         '&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;
             in connection with other financing or possible expansion, if       i&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;

             they need to raise some additional equity money -- I think&#13;

             this might be something that the IFC could take a look at,         i&#13;

             but as far as making a loan this would just be too big for thel&#13;

                      MR. DE ALBA:       First of all, we have to keep in mind i&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;

          that this is a captive production which is going to provide&#13;
&#13;
              coal for their coking operations, and the aim of the Indian&#13;
              Iron and Steel Company is to produce steel.     Now, it is&#13;
&#13;
              extremely difficult to follow through the whole thing and&#13;
&#13;
              find out how many rupees per ton it is going to cost to pro-&#13;
&#13;
              duce the coal.     Nevertheless, we did have some ideas about&#13;
&#13;
              how much the coal was going to cost.     These estimatesl'ere a&#13;
&#13;
              little bit difficult to make because most of the operation,&#13;
&#13;
              which has extremely difficult mining conditions, and we don*t&#13;
&#13;
          Ii really know what we are going to find until we open up this&#13;
          ~&#13;
              mine.   But at the same time an estimate is made quite con-&#13;
          ~&#13;
          i   servatively.     We found that Chasnalla coal could be produced&#13;
          I&#13;
          I   at about 15 rupees per ton, as against the price they are&#13;
&#13;
              paying now of about 20 reupees per ton.     Now, it looks too&#13;
&#13;
              much on the optimistic side.     There are so many unknowns&#13;
                                                                                   i&#13;

              when we open up this field that we didn't want to make any           i&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;

              specific mention about the cost of production from this mine, 1&#13;

              should not have a much lower cost from Chasnalla than they           I&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;

              are paying now to the foreign suppliers.&#13;
                        MR. GOLDMAN:     I was sure thiswas so.   I too didn't&#13;
&#13;
              think it was quite clear on the evidence it also was a big&#13;
&#13;
              improvement in the whole technical operation of the company.&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
              It was more for the impact of this on its finances specif1cal*1&#13;
                                                                            !&#13;
              and the relationship between the new investment and the return&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          on that that I was interested in.&#13;
&#13;
                          I do see that there are great difficulties in making&#13;
&#13;
                calculations of this kind.&#13;
&#13;
                          MR. KNAPP:    Mr. Chairman, I think it is pertinent&#13;
&#13;
                to recall that the steel industry in India is a heavily regu-&#13;
&#13;
                lated industry, including severe regulation through the&#13;
&#13;
                system of prices, and although the Indian Government has not&#13;
&#13;
                formulated, as I understand it, its policy on retention prices&#13;
&#13;
          11    for the future I think it is under consideration.       I have&#13;
          I!&#13;
          II&#13;
          11    heard a lot of talk at least about a discriminatory policy&#13;
&#13;
          [\ \lilich would relate prices to costs, and in this sense there&#13;
&#13;
          II is also a close profit        regulation in India's steel industry.&#13;
          I!&#13;
           i              So if Mr. Goldman is worried we might all be worried&#13;
           I&#13;
&#13;
           I about    conferring some bonanza here upon the private companies.&#13;
&#13;
                I don't think there is too much grounds for that.&#13;
&#13;
                          THE CHAIRMAN:     I don 1 t either.&#13;
&#13;
                          Dr. Donner.&#13;
                          MR. DONNER:     Mr. Chairman, I do not have any dif-&#13;
&#13;
               , ficulty in going along with this project.      The investment&#13;
&#13;
                takes place in a field with regard to which the Bank in its&#13;
&#13;
                assessment last summer, 1960, of the Third Plan had expressed&#13;
&#13;
                grave concern and has repeated it today that indeed the&#13;
&#13;
                production of coal particularly is a very severe bottleneck.&#13;
&#13;
                This project will help if continued to open up and widen&#13;
&#13;
                somewhat this bottleneck.     It is a favorable project, and the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                               21&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             production of this coal will be cheaper for the firm than the&#13;
&#13;
             prices it would have to pay if it buys coal from other places.&#13;
&#13;
             The quality of the coal will be better, and with the realiza-&#13;
&#13;
             tion of the project the railway system, which is heavily over-.&#13;
&#13;
             loaded as we lcnow will not be further burdened.&#13;
&#13;
                       Last and not least, the execution of the pro.ject is,:&#13;
&#13;
             as you yourself, Mr. Chairman, have just said once more, in&#13;
&#13;
             the hands of an excellent firm.&#13;
&#13;
                       So far as I can see on all points this project&#13;
&#13;
             qualifies for Bank financing.&#13;
&#13;
                       Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                       THE CHAIRMAN:    Thanks.                                     '&#13;

               certainly feel that it is a very good investment.&#13;
&#13;
                           I have a few technical questions to ask.&#13;
&#13;
                           I have cc:mpared some of the figures given with&#13;
&#13;
               respect to this project with some general figures presented&#13;
&#13;
               to us in the appraisal report of the Indian Coal Industry,&#13;

               to which I referred already.&#13;

               mines has been estimated at 50 rupees per ton of annual out-&#13;

               put.   This particular project, being a joint project for&#13;

               the sand gathering and for the opening of new mines, I was&#13;

            the 29.7.&#13;
&#13;
                        I wonder whether if we compare the specific figure&#13;
&#13;
          ' of this project with the general figures in the preceding&#13;
&#13;
            report we would not come to a much higher figure from a&#13;
&#13;
            realistic basis of this particular project.     Perhaps in the&#13;
&#13;
            general report these costs, which I think should be added,&#13;
&#13;
            namely, for the sand gathering and administration and contin-&#13;
&#13;
            gencies, and so on, were also excluded, but I have some doubts&#13;
&#13;
            whether this figure of 29.7 rupees per ton investment cost&#13;
&#13;
            is a realistic one, if we take into consideration that at&#13;
&#13;
            least the sand gathering and part of the administration and&#13;
&#13;
            contingencies expenditures figures should be added to come to&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢:a reasonable investment figure.&#13;
&#13;
                        In this connection, I wonder whether a certain per-&#13;
&#13;
            cent for contingencies is a realistic figure.&#13;
&#13;
                        We find in the technical report that the estimates&#13;
&#13;
            of local currency expenditures in the preceding projects&#13;
&#13;
            have in certain cases been almost double the estimated ones,&#13;
&#13;
            and I would feel safer if in this case, too, a higher figure&#13;
&#13;
            for contingencies would have been taken into consideration.&#13;
&#13;
                        Now, my second question is:   What is the estimate of&#13;
&#13;
            the cost of production per ton of this company, compared with&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        24&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          the so-called normal costs which are basic for the price&#13;
&#13;
         policies?    The costs were fully discussed in the preceding&#13;
&#13;
         paper, R 61-78, and they came to about 17.90 rupees per ton.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. de Alba has already given a tentative figure     of 14 to 15&#13;
&#13;
         rupees per ton for this particulariroject in reply to Mr.&#13;
&#13;
         Goldman's question.&#13;
&#13;
                     I am interested to know how this relatively low&#13;
&#13;
         figure can be achieved, in view of the fact that the report&#13;
&#13;
         points out very clearly that the mines in question are very&#13;
&#13;
         difficult ones to operate, the seams are rather steep and water&#13;
&#13;
         danger is very imminent, and measures have to be taken to&#13;
&#13;
         protect the mines from water and floods.&#13;
&#13;
                     Labor costs certainly are low.   That would explain&#13;
&#13;
         a low cost figure, but for the normal cost calculations in&#13;
&#13;
         general these low labor costs also constitute an element.&#13;
&#13;
                     So I would like to inquire how it is to be explained&#13;
&#13;
         that in this particular case, although the natural conditions&#13;
&#13;
         are not too favorable, the cost estimates are so far below the'&#13;
                         ~&#13;
         normal costs in gh-e general report.&#13;
&#13;
                     Finally, I would like to inquire whether the staff&#13;
&#13;
         and management are at present more satisfied about the coal&#13;
&#13;
         price policies of the Indian Government than they were some         I&#13;
                                                                             i&#13;
                                                                             I&#13;
                                                                             l&#13;
         time ago.    We know that coal is in very short supply, and thatl&#13;
                                                                             I&#13;

                                                                             I&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                             25&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             given by a reasonable price policy, because this is of such&#13;
&#13;
             general importance in this sector of production.&#13;
                       I am very much interested to know whether there&#13;
&#13;
             have been any favorable changes in the price policies.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. DE ALBA:     Mr. Lieftinck, I will try to answer&#13;
&#13;
             one by one your questions.&#13;
&#13;
                       The reason why we exclude from our comparison the&#13;
&#13;
             sand gathering stations and sand ropeways is because that was&#13;
&#13;
             done by the private coal sector also.     The Indian Government&#13;
&#13;
        I! is building a very extensive sector of sand gathering stations.&#13;
&#13;
             and ropeways, and they are going to more or less carry the&#13;
        l&#13;
        11&#13;
             cost of sand storing or giving a premium       it hasn't been&#13;
&#13;
         I   decided yet -- of 2 or 3 rupees per ton.     So what we are&#13;
        r trying to do was to precisely make the two things comparable.&#13;
        11&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. LIEFTINCK:     You mean for international compari-&#13;
        1!&#13;
         I son these figures should be revised?&#13;
         i&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. DE ALBA:     I am not talking about international&#13;
         , comparison.    I am talking exclusively between the Indian Iron&#13;
             and Coal project and the private sector coal project.&#13;
                       The Indian Iron and Steel project is a specific&#13;
&#13;
         1   project that we had a chance to go and see what we are talking&#13;
        I about&#13;
         1         and see the actual mining operations and make studies&#13;
        I&#13;
        1 quite    sizeable and, we hope, accurate.&#13;
         I&#13;
        II&#13;
                       In the case of the private sector you have to keep&#13;
&#13;
        l in mind    that you are going to deal with about not a hundred,&#13;
&#13;
         las Mr. Mason mentioned, tut about 1,500 different collieries,&#13;
&#13;
        i&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    26&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          from production of a few thousand tons to production of close&#13;
                   to a million tons.     That is the range that you have here.&#13;
                   You have some holes in the ground where you have a couple of&#13;
                   men using picks and shovels and about half a dozen women&#13;
                   carrying baskets of coal on their heads to bring the coal out&#13;
                   of these pits, and that represents about 20 to 30 percent&#13;
          :~       of the coal produced by the private sector.     From there you&#13;
          I'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          !I havei'fo fairly mechanized mines.          I haven 1 t seen a fully&#13;
          i&#13;
          II mechanized, fully modernized mine yet, but we hope to have one,&#13;
          1&#13;
           1    when we finish up this thing.&#13;
           I&#13;
&#13;
                                so you can see the comparison is impossible to make&#13;
                   on a sound basis, so really we were just toying with making&#13;
                   comparisons as to the sand gathering and sand transportation&#13;
                   in our estimates here and in the private coal sector.&#13;
                                The coal formation plant is a different proposition&#13;
&#13;
                   also not only in the private but the outside Indian Iron and&#13;
                Steel.        The Government has installed and is installing coal&#13;
                washers, and thererore the cost of those washers was not&#13;
&#13;
                   included in the estimates made of theprivate coal sector.&#13;
                                                                                         i'&#13;
                                                                                         i&#13;
                                These are the main two items that you mentioned, andi&#13;
               i as you can see are all excluded.&#13;
                                Now, the other thing you mentioned is the contin-&#13;
                                                                                         l&#13;
                   gencies.    We have been pretty close to our estimates in the         j&#13;
                                                                                         l&#13;
                                                                                         I&#13;
                   foreign exchange requirements for the two previous projects.          I&#13;
               ! Now, the contingencies for tl:e local expenditures were a         littl~&#13;
               I                                                                         I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                  27&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          bit off beam, I should say, and we took great pains this time&#13;
&#13;
                   with the ccmpany's executives and the consultants to make&#13;
                   sure that they have considered adequate contingencies.&#13;
&#13;
                             Well, anything can happen.   The cost of labor is&#13;
&#13;
                   subject to policies of the Indian Government, andmany other&#13;
&#13;
                   things, and it is not for us to calculate or estimate on this&#13;
&#13;
                   thing.   Blt we are hopeful that this is going to be closer&#13;
&#13;
                   than the previous one.&#13;
&#13;
                             Now, on the foreign exchange I feel pretty sure we&#13;
&#13;
          Â·~       have enough there to take care of any substantial changes ..&#13;
&#13;
          i: especially when we consider that most of the equipment will be&#13;
          ,,&#13;
          I&#13;
&#13;
          Ii:! bought in the first two years of the project.        So I don't&#13;
          11&#13;
          Ii think that there are going to be substantial variations from&#13;
          II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          i&#13;
                   the price of coal in such a short period of time.&#13;
          I!&#13;
          11                 Regarding the cost of production, as I mentioned&#13;
          i!&#13;
          11&#13;
          I before this cost of production of the private sector is some-&#13;
          II&#13;
               I&#13;
               I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   thing that the Indian Government arrived at.    Officials of the:&#13;
                                                                                        I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   Indian Government claim it is a fairly good or was a fairly&#13;
&#13;
                   good estimate at the time it was estimated.    For some other&#13;
&#13;
                   companies they say it is absolutely out of range, that it is&#13;
               l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               ! higher or lower.&#13;
&#13;
                             I have seen some fairly mechanized mines with higher&#13;
&#13;
                   cost and have seen many of these small mines extracting coal&#13;
&#13;
               ' by hand with really much less cost than is estimated here.             !&#13;
                                                                                        ;&#13;
                                                                                        ;&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       iq&#13;
                                                                                        I&#13;
&#13;
               , So also our estimate in this case is very approximate.      That&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                               28&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          why we didn't mention specific figures in our report, because&#13;
               the mining conditions are going to be especially difficult,&#13;
               and we just hope that we are going to be fairly below present&#13;
               costs because of the highly mechanized mine we are going to&#13;
               have there, and the fact that we are going to have a couple of&#13;
               openings which will give us more or less a fair balance in&#13;
               the cost of prod.uction.    But what the cost is going to be I&#13;
               can tell you five years fran now fairly accurately.&#13;
                         THE CHAIRMAN:    Thanks â&#128;¢&#13;
                         MR. KNAPP:     I think there was a question also on&#13;
               price policies.&#13;
                         MR. DE ALBA:     This is again one of the things we&#13;
               have discussed with the coal controllers, especially now that&#13;
               we are working on the private coal sector, and they are&#13;
           : planning to revise the prices. It is a complicated thing,&#13;
           I&#13;
          II&#13;
             because as I mentioned before they have some premium for&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             it.&#13;
                          MR. KNAPP:     Mr. de Alba, isn't it generally true to&#13;
&#13;
             say when we presented the loan l:ee::ll we were critical of some&#13;
&#13;
             features of the price policy, and there have not been any&#13;
&#13;
             significant changes since that time?&#13;
&#13;
                          MR. DE ALBA:     I think it would be extremely difficult&#13;
&#13;
             to do it because of the fact that they have their own sector&#13;
&#13;
             of coal production, which is absolutely different from the&#13;
&#13;
             private sector way of producing.            So they are trying to&#13;
&#13;
             provide the standards which are applicable to the public&#13;
&#13;
             sector and large modern mines to the public sector, which has&#13;
&#13;
             all these many complicated little mines and very steep seams&#13;
&#13;
             and all this.     It is very difficult for us to really put the&#13;
&#13;
             pressure on them to make a reasonable price policy.            We are&#13;
&#13;
             trying to,     and they said,     11&#13;
                                                    We are trying to do the best we&#13;
&#13;
             can, 11 but we think that until we have the washers installed&#13;
&#13;
             and all the sand ropeways installed and have a fairly good&#13;
&#13;
             idea of what it 1s going to cost to provide these servicei5,&#13;
&#13;
             then we can fairly cane out with a more reasonable price,&#13;
&#13;
             probably in a couple of years or so.&#13;
&#13;
                          MR. LIEFTINCK:     May I just comment on the latter&#13;
&#13;
             part of it, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                          In paragraph 58, on page 15 of the previous report,&#13;
&#13;
        I'   the staff expressed the somewhat different view, which I still&#13;
        I&#13;
        I: think is the correct one.         They stated that the agreement on&#13;
        1:&#13;
&#13;
        Ii&#13;
&#13;
        Ii&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   30&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          prices is not satisfactory, that these concessions do not get&#13;
&#13;
                   the Government out of the private coal industry but are&#13;
&#13;
                   getting them in deeper, and instead of an elaborate system of&#13;
&#13;
                   price controls the price should be allowed to find its own&#13;
&#13;
                   level, and the demand from the free market would get quality&#13;
&#13;
                   coal out of the difficult mines much more efficiently than&#13;
&#13;
                   subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
                                Of course, it is not up to the Bank to dictate or&#13;
&#13;
                   even try to strongly influence the Indian authorities with&#13;
&#13;
                   respect to their price policies.                  That is up to them.        On the&#13;
               l other hand,      I   think we are entitled to point out what in the&#13;
&#13;
          I opinion of the Bank would&#13;
           I'&#13;

                                                    be perhaps the most conducive to&#13;
&#13;
                   reaching the goals which the Indian Government has set.&#13;
               I                THE CHAIRMAN:      I agree with you.&#13;
&#13;
                                Anyone else?      Any other questions?           If there are&#13;
&#13;
                   no other questions, may I have a motion?&#13;
&#13;
                                MR. COCKE:     I so move.&#13;
                                (Upon motion duly made and seconded, the resolution&#13;
&#13;
                   was adopted unanimously.)&#13;
