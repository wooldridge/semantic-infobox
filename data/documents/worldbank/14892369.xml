          Consensus Buildingâ&#128;&#148;Regional, district and local workshops (termed Whole System in a Room, or WSR) were conducted with representatives&#13;
          from all levels of eight main stakeholder groupsâ&#128;&#148;Health, Education, Water Resources, Women, Youth and Teachers, Faith Based, Private Sector,&#13;
          and Political Leadership.&#13;
          Alignment of Regional and National Strategiesâ&#128;&#148;The CLTS and Hygiene (CLTS+H) approach is now integrated into the Ministry of Healthâ&#128;&#153;s national&#13;
          approach and the National Health Extension Program (HEP) which is cascaded to the regions. Common ground was formed with the Regional Health&#13;
          Bureau to integrate the at-scale sanitation program with the existing HEP where seven out of the sixteen targeted community based programs deal with&#13;
          environmental sanitation.&#13;
          Multi-tiered Advocacyâ&#128;&#148;WSP/HIP and regional partners conducted multi-level advocacy in regions, zones, woredas (districts), kebeles (sub-&#13;
          districts), and gotts (community clusters) to garner broad buy-in.&#13;

          Promoting Behavior Changeâ&#128;&#148;Household-level outreach focused on multiple behaviors and doable actions that leveraged community/group&#13;
          dynamics to ignite action.&#13;
          Building Capacityâ&#128;&#148;A comprehensive capacity-building training focusing on community mobilization, data collection and collation, and negotiation&#13;
          or problem-solving to increase sustained uptake of doable actions at household level was conducted for government-paid Health Extension Workers&#13;
          (HEWs) prominent community-resource people, and volunteer community health promoters (VCHPs) who supported HEWs by following-up on action&#13;
          plans at the village level.&#13;
          Implementationâ&#128;&#148;Based on mapping data that showed an absence of any systematic system to scale up sanitation and sustain behavior change in&#13;
          the region, several well-tested tools were used for implementation. These included: CLTS for community mobilization; Jobaides (laminated pictures) and&#13;
          dialogue cards to help HEWs initiate simple doable actions at household levels; additional manuals and guidelines to support HEW and VCHP activities;&#13;
          and the Woredas Resource Book, sharing a twelve-step plan for multiple districts to follow the program and work toward achieving the same standards.&#13;

            Learning by doing : working at scale in Ethiopia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 2005, an estimated 15.2 million
            people or 80 percent of the total population of the Amhara
            Region in Ethiopia lived in rural areas where
            sanitation-related indicators were low. Open defecation was
            common; hand washing, particularly after defecation, was
            practiced infrequently; and general housing environments
            were unsanitary, with cohabitation with animals a common
            occurrence. There was a high prevalence of health issues
            correlating to poor sanitation and hygiene such as
            intestinal parasites, diarrhea, and eye and skin diseases.
            During that timeframe, the Water and Sanitation Program
            (WSP) worked with the Ministry of Health, providing support
            to design a Sanitation Strategy and On-Site Sanitation
            protocol. WSP also gained experience in scaling up
            sanitation by working closely with the Southern Nations,
            Nationalities, and People's Regional Government Health
            Bureau. These experiences and government motivation to
            change conditions provided an opportunity to design a
            community-led, systematic approach to implement a
            sustainable at-scale sanitation program based on the
            strategy and protocol.
