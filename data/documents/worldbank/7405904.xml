            Niger - Rural and Social Sector Policy
            Reform Project : partial waiver of one prior action for the
            release of the second tranche
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This memorandum recommends the release
            of the second tranche of the Rural and Social Policy Reform
            Credit (RSRC-1) (Credit No. 4189) for Niger. The memorandum
            argues that the Government of Niger has made satisfactory
            progress overall in implementing the program supported by
            the credit as set forth in its Letter of Development Policy
            and has fully met eight of the nine prior actions for
            release of the second tranche. A partial waiver for one
            prior condition related to the regional recruitment process
            for qualified health staff is being requested which was
            prior action number 8: Pass the ministerial arrete
            (published in the Official Gazette) for the launching of a
            regional recruitment process for qualified staff (national
            total of 715 contractual agents and civil servants) to
            address the human resource deficit in the public health
            sector in accordance with the recipient's strategic
            objectives. Given the shortage of qualified available health
            staff; this gap could not be filled, but the provision is
            waived based on Niger's efforts in still trying to meet
            this objective and Niger's satisfactory progress overall.
