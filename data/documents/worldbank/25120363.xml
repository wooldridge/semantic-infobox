                                                INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
This Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Management Plan (IMP) provides a detailed foundation for the&#13;
World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s (WBG) comprehensive effort to measure and manage greenhouse gas emissions from&#13;
its internal global business operations. The IMP does not apply to the lending or technical assistance activities&#13;
that the World Bank Group provides to its public and private sector clients. This document provides&#13;
organization-wide information, including corporate overview and goals, boundary conditions of the&#13;
inventory, emissions quantification methods, data management methods, base year selection discussion, list of&#13;
management tools, and auditing and verification processes.&#13;
The World Bank Group consists of five closely associated institutions located in over 180 countries and&#13;
owned by member countries that carry ultimate decision-making power. Each institution plays a distinct role&#13;
in the mission to fight poverty and improve living standards for people in the developing world.&#13;
&#13;
The IMP sets forth the current scope and vision of WBGâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to inventory and manage greenhouse&#13;
gas (GHG) emissions for its internal global business operations and contains the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s greenhouse gas&#13;
inventory methodology. It sets forth the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s intention to create a GHG inventory that is consistent with the&#13;
principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for&#13;
Sustainable Developmentâ&#128;&#153;s (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative ( GHG Protocol) for its internal&#13;
corporate greenhouse gas accounting and reporting. The inventory methodology is designed to meet the&#13;
most rigorous and complete accounting and reporting standards.&#13;
&#13;
In 2007 the World Bank (WB) joined the EPA Climate Leaders Program and set a voluntary target for&#13;
reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This IMP includes information that applies to the offices located in the&#13;
United States and complies by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s previous participation in the U.S. EPAâ&#128;&#153;s Climate Leaders&#13;
Program. The U.S. EPA Climate Leaders program was phased out as of 9/15/2010 and the WB is no&#13;
longer required to report annual emissions information to the EPA. However, the WB will continue to abide&#13;
by EPA guidance for GHG inventories, and is researching other alternatives for reporting and goal setting,&#13;
including its current participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project and the UN Climate Neutral Initiative. The&#13;
global facilities inventory is maintained on a fiscal year basis only. Both domestic and international emissions&#13;
are calculated using the same methodology to ensure consistency in the quantification process among all&#13;
locations.&#13;
&#13;
DEFINITION OF SCOPE IN GHG PROTOCOL&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group segregates its emissions types by Scopes 1, 2, and 3, as defined by the GHG&#13;
Protocol. The following are examples of office emissions sources from the GHG Protocol publication&#13;
Working 9 to 5 on Climate Change: An Office Guide (WRI 2002).&#13;
&#13;
                           ï&#130;§    Combustion of fuel in boilers or furnaces that are owned by the reporting organization&#13;
                           ï&#130;§    Generation of electricity, steam, or heat in equipment that is owned by the reporting&#13;
                                organization&#13;
 Scope 1: Direct           ï&#130;§    Business travel in vehicles that are owned by the reporting organization, such as company&#13;
 emissions sources              cars or corporate jets&#13;
                           ï&#130;§    Employee commuting in company-owned vehicles, such as shuttles and company cars&#13;
                           ï&#130;§    Fugitive emissions of refrigerant from chillers or other refrigeration units owned by the&#13;
                                reporting organization&#13;
 Scope 2: Indirect&#13;
                           ï&#130;§    Generation of purchased electricity, steam, heat, or chilled water&#13;
 emissions sources&#13;
&#13;
 Scope 3: Optional         ï&#130;§    Business travel in non-company-owned vehicles such as rental cars, employee cars, trains,&#13;
 sources                        and commercial planes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                     2|Page&#13;

                                        WBG BOUNDARY CONDITIONS&#13;
&#13;
Boundary conditions serve as the foundation for the GHG in ventory by defining both the inventoryâ&#128;&#153;s breadth&#13;
and depth. To provide a rigorous and complete GHG inventory, the WBG has defined both organizational&#13;
and operational boundary conditions consistent with the GHG Protocol guidance.&#13;
&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARY&#13;
&#13;
Organization boundary conditions define the breadth of the GHG inventory by identifying the locations&#13;
where the WBG assumes responsibility for GHG emissions. According to the GHG Protocol, a companyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
organizational boundaries can either be defined by the amount of equity a company has in an operation&#13;
(â&#128;&#156;Equity Approachâ&#128;&#157;) or based on a companyâ&#128;&#153;s operational control over a location or facility (â&#128;&#156;Control&#13;
Approachâ&#128;&#157;). The GHG Protocol also requires that a company select the type of organizational boundary&#13;
according to which method most accurately reflects the day-to-day practices of the business. That boundary&#13;
approach should then be consistently applied to define the companyâ&#128;&#153;s business and operations in a way that&#13;
best constitutes the businessâ&#128;&#153;s operations for the purpose of GHG emissions accounting and reporting.&#13;
The WBG has chosen to set its organizational boundaries for the GHG inventory according to the&#13;
operational control approach. Consistent with this approach the WBG accounts for GHG emissions from its&#13;
locations for which it has direct control over operations, and where it can influence decisions that impact&#13;
GHG emissions. This includes all owned and leased facilities/vehicles operated by WBG. A portion of&#13;
leased facilities operate under full-service gross leases, where the building owner/manager pays the utilities&#13;
directly and WBG does not have access to actual energy consumption information. WBG includes these&#13;
facilities in its definition of operational control and estimates the energy consumption as well as refrigerant&#13;
use if this data is unavailable as described in the Data Management section below.&#13;
WB locations have been identified by the General Services Department Corporate Real Estate office&#13;
(GSDCR), while IFC locations are from the IFC Real Estate Database managed by the IFCâ&#128;&#153;s Facilities&#13;
Management team. A list of offices included the FY 14 GHG inventory can be found in Appendix F.&#13;

&#13;
OPERATIONAL BOUNDARY AND SCOPE&#13;
&#13;
    Since 2008, the operational boundary of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s carbon inventory has included all core direct&#13;
    (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions associated with all global WBG facilities with operational&#13;
    control (including headquarters operations in Washington, DC, all leased facilities, and all country&#13;
    offices). Emissions from global employee business air travel are included in Scope 3. Prior to 2008, our&#13;
    scope was limited to headquarters operations in Washington DC only, including Washington, DC and&#13;
    Virginia leased facilities and facilities with operational control, and only DC-based employee travel.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§   Direct Emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the WBG, including emissions from&#13;
        on-site fuel burning equipment (for example, boilers, backup generators) and fugitive emissions&#13;
        from process equipment (for example, refrigerant from refrigeration and HVAC equipment).&#13;
        Mobile emissions from combustion of fuel in WBG-owned vehicles are also included.&#13;
    ï&#130;§   Indirect Emissions from electricity, steam and chilled water purchased by the WBG.&#13;
    ï&#130;§   Other Indirect Emissions from WBG employee business air travel and leased vehicles operated&#13;
        by other organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GHG LIST&#13;
&#13;
The WBG greenhouse gas inventory includes emissions from five of the six major GHG gases (there are no&#13;
known emissions from SF6):&#13;
     ï&#130;§ CO2&#13;
     ï&#130;§ CH4&#13;
     ï&#130;§ N2O&#13;
     ï&#130;§ HFCs&#13;
     ï&#130;§ PFCs&#13;
In addition, the global inventory includes emissions from CFCs and HCFCs as supplemental emissions, both of&#13;
which are optional for inventory and reporting purposes according to GHG Protocol and EPA Climate&#13;
Leaders guidance.&#13;
&#13;
WBG BOUNDARY CONDITION ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
&#13;
To the extent possible, this IMP attempts to standardize our inventory methodology to all WBG offices.&#13;
There are, however, a few exceptions. Our boundary assumptions are outlined as follows:&#13;
        Assumptions: Global Inventory&#13;
    ï&#130;§   Where there is shared World Bank and IFC office space, emissions are apportioned between the&#13;
        agencies by percentage of total area as detailed in lease agreements and memoranda of&#13;
        understanding, where available. When this information is not available, emissions are apportioned&#13;
        by percentage of area which is based on the percentage of total staff for each agency. For&#13;
        example, in a location where the proportion of IFC to WB space is not known, if there are an equal&#13;
        number of staff from each agency, then it is assumed that each agency occupies an equal amount&#13;
        of space in the office.&#13;
    ï&#130;§   Data for WB and IFC GHG inventories are collected and compiled separately using the same&#13;
        methodology and aggregated within the same WBG inventory document. A web-based database&#13;
        is used to centralize and manage the data collection and reporting process.&#13;
    ï&#130;§   For business travel, only employee air travel data is collected and included because the majority of&#13;
        WBG business travel impacts are associated with plane travel.&#13;
    ï&#130;§   If a WBG office houses five or fewer employees, it is assumed that activity data is difficult to&#13;
        obtain, and that the contribution of emissions is relatively insignificant. While every office is&#13;
        provided an opportunity to report activity data where possible, WBGâ&#128;&#153;s online data management&#13;
        system allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees the option to (a)&#13;
        default to estimated emissions for electricity use and refrigerants (methodology for estimations are&#13;
        provided in relevant sections below in this IMP), and (b) to exempt the office from reporting on-site&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 5|Page&#13;
&amp;#12;                      The World Bank Group FY14 GHG Inventory Management Plan&#13;
&#13;
         fuel and mobile sources if the information is not easily accessible (estimates are not made for on-&#13;
         site fuel and mobiles sources given there is no credible methodology to do so).&#13;
    ï&#130;§    In FY2007, employee number estimates were based on numbers for staff and extended-term&#13;
         consultants and extended-term temporaries as of the close of the fiscal year (June 30) provided by&#13;
         the Human Resources Analytics Department (HRSAN). In FY2008 the WBG requested that country&#13;
         offices provide data on all employees located in their offices, detailing the number of contractors,&#13;
         consultants, and staff working from the office as of the close of the fiscal year (June 30). In FY2009&#13;
         and going forward, the WBG reverted back to numbers for staff and extended-term consultants&#13;
         and temporaries as of the close of the fiscal year (June 30) provided by HRSAN and IFCHR in an&#13;
         effort to standardize measurement.&#13;
    ï&#130;§    In the absence of a complete country office database, office area data for World Bank offices is&#13;
         entered by data owners in each of the offices and confirmed with CO Real Estate Tracking&#13;
         database where possible. For IFC offices, office area is extracted from the country office real&#13;
         estate database and uploaded into the Credit360 system. Any discrepancies may then be&#13;
         identified by data owners in each office.&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Homes owned by the World Bank Group in developing countries are not included in the inventory&#13;
         because the WBG does not control the operations of these buildings and activity data is difficult to&#13;
         obtain.&#13;
         Exceptions&#13;
    ï&#130;§    The IFC and WB share archive, business continuity center, and warehouse space leased by the&#13;
         World Bank. Since the World Bank manages the lease, the WB reports 100 percent of these&#13;
         emissions, including the Chantilly Facility (CF; located in Chantilly, VA), the Archives (located near&#13;
         Pittsburgh, PA), the Landover Service Center (LSC; located in Landover, MD) and the Warehouse&#13;
         (located in Sterling, VA).&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Emissions are estimated for buildings in Washington, DC where the WBG lacks operational control.&#13;
         To estimate emissions, assumptions about electricity usage are made based on area. Refrigerant&#13;
         emissions are estimated based on the technique described below. Due to lack of access to&#13;
         information, estimates are not made for on-site fuel consumption.&#13;
    ï&#130;§    There are mail vans in Washington, DC leased by the WB and used by both WB and IFC&#13;
         employees. The WB accounts for 100 percent of these emissions because they control the van&#13;
         leases and employ the van drivers. Because the IFC does not own any vehicles in Washington, DC,&#13;
         no emissions associated with vehicle refrigerant are reported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         EMISSIONS QUANTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
The following sections explain the GHG emissions quantification approach for each of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s emissions&#13;
sources contained within the boundaries of the fiscal year 2014 (FY14) GHG inventory.&#13;
All methodologies are based on guidance from the GHG Protocol with emission factors taken from&#13;
governmental and international organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#13;
(IPCC), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the International Energy Agency (IEA). All sources&#13;
are noted in the appendices.&#13;
Emissions for both country offices and Washington, DC are calculated using similar equations. An annual&#13;
survey is conducted to collect activity data from WBG locations in the Master Location List (Appendix F).&#13;
Beginning in FY2009, this survey was conducted through a Web-based data management system called&#13;
Credit360, found online at http://worldbank.credit360.com. See Appendix G for screenshots from the FY13&#13;
survey.&#13;
When activity data is unavailable, emissions estimates are made for electricity, refrigerants, and air travel&#13;
based on office area or number of employees. Data gaps and data quality issues still exist in the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
inventory that will be addressed along with data quality issues as additional and more accurate data&#13;
become available over time. The primary data gaps are in country offices and predominately in smaller&#13;
offices. For a summary of FY14 emissions, please see the attached report.&#13;

                               ON-SITE (STATIONARY) COMBUSTION â&#128;&#147; SCOPE 1&#13;
&#13;
         Quantifying Emissions from On-site (Stationary) Combustion&#13;
On-site combustion of fossil fuels for the generation of electricity, heat, or steam is one source of direct&#13;
emissions. To calculate the GHG emissions from on-site fuel combustion, the WBG collects the annual quantity&#13;
of fuel purchased. To be conservative, the WBG assumes that all fuel purchased is also combusted in on-site&#13;
operations in that same year. An appropriate emissions factor for each fuel type used is applied. Fuels used&#13;
at WBG locations include diesel, gasoline, natural gas, propane, LPG, and kerosene.&#13;
Emissions are determined for each fuel source by multiplying the total annual fuel quantity expressed in units&#13;
of energy purchased by the appropriate emissions factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O. If fuel quantity&#13;
purchased is reported in volume or mass, this quantity is converted to units of energy based on the fuelâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
heat content. Heat contents for specific fuels are listed in Appendix A. Totals for CH4 and N2O are&#13;
multiplied by their global warming potentials (GWPs) to calculate CO2 equivalent emissions. See Appendix&#13;
A for a table detailing stationary fuel emissions factors. CO2 and CO2 equivalent emissions for all fuels&#13;
combusted are summed to obtain the total CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emissions for the year. Figure 1 shows&#13;
the calculation used when data is provided.&#13;

&#13;
Occasionally, WBG offices are able to provide activity data on total fuel use for their buildings but not for&#13;
WBG occupied space. In this case, if both the total building area is known as well as the WBG occupied&#13;
area, the total fuel use is prorated for WBG occupied space and then multiplied by the appropriate&#13;
emissions factors (Figure 2) to obtain the total CO2 equivalent emissions for the year.&#13;

There is no credible methodology to estimate emissions for missing on-site fuel data. WBGâ&#128;&#153;s online data&#13;
management system allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees the option to&#13;
exempt himself/herself from reporting on-site fuel if the information is not easily accessible. The WBG&#13;
anticipates this data gap will improve in years to come as data providers gain more experience in&#13;
gathering the data.&#13;
If an office has provided reliable fuel data in previous years but did not provide a response to the call for&#13;
data this year, fuel use from the previous year is used as a proxy for this yearâ&#128;&#153;s fuel use.&#13;

                                          REFRIGERANTS â&#128;&#147; SCOPE 1&#13;
&#13;
Refrigeration, freezer, and air-conditioning equipment leak refrigerants. GHGs from heating, ventilation, or&#13;
air conditioning (HVAC) operations, refrigeration, and freezer units are not intentionally released, but&#13;
escape into the atmosphere as fugitive emissions through varying means, including but not limited to&#13;
maintenance, installation, disposal, and operational leakage. Each refrigerant CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) is&#13;
calculated by multiplying the mass of refrigerant by its global warming potential (GWP).&#13;
Two methods to calculate GHG emissions of refrigerants are explained in the GHG Protocol. The first&#13;
(preferred) method requires the annual amount of each type of refrigerant purchased for each location&#13;
(quantity-purchased method). The second method, relating to capacity and leakage characteristics by&#13;
equipment type, requires the total capacity for refrigerants in each type of equipment used at a location,&#13;
the corresponding manufacturerâ&#128;&#153;s leakage rate for eac h type of equipment, and the type of refrigerant&#13;
used in each type of equipment. Equipment types are distinguished by whether the equipment is a HVAC&#13;
&#13;

unit, a freezer, or a refrigeration unit. Due to activity data available, only the first method is used for the&#13;
WBG inventory.&#13;
         Quantifying Emissions from Refrigerants&#13;
Refrigerant CO2 equivalents are calculated by multiplying the weight of escaped refrigerant by the&#13;
corresponding GWP. GWPs for refrigerants reported in the inventory are gathered from the&#13;
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or from sources referencing the IPCC. See Appendix B&#13;
for details on GWPs of refrigerants and sources. If the type of refrigerant is unknown (â&#128;&#156;otherâ&#128;&#157; is chosen in&#13;
the online survey), HFC-134a is assumed to be the refrigerant type. See Figure 3 for the preferred&#13;
calculation methodology, and Table 2 for the calculation method used in cases where refrigerant data are&#13;
not available.&#13;

&#13;
In some cases, WBG country offices are able to provide the refrigerant recharge quantity for the entire&#13;
building but not for WBG occupied space. In this case, if both the total building area is known as well as the&#13;
WBG occupied area, the total refrigerant recharge amount is prorated for the WBG occupied space and&#13;
then multiplied by the appropriate refrigerant-specific global warming potential to obtain the total CO2eq&#13;
emissions for the year.&#13;
In the case where activity data (refrigerant purchases) is not available for use, emissions are estimated&#13;
based on the refrigerant emission rate (ton refrigerant emitted/ft2/year) based on the occupied WB/IFC&#13;
building area.&#13;
The method used to calculate the intensity rate is laid out in Table 2. In this method, the estimated area per&#13;
ton of cooling (1 ton of cooling per 500 ft2 is commonly used in the United States and will be used globally&#13;
for our purposes) is multiplied by a conversion factor of one ton of cooling per one kg of refrigerant charge&#13;
and then by an assumed leakage rate of 10 percent. The resulting kilogram of refrigerant per square foot&#13;
factor is multiplied by the square footage of the location that did not provide refrigeration data. This&#13;
calculation results in the estimated number of kilograms of refrigerant recharge used in the IFC/WB building&#13;
area.&#13;

&#13;
The emissions rate used (0.0000002 ton refrigerant per ft 2-year) is then multiplied by the area of the&#13;
WB/IFC building area and then by the GWP of the refrigerant type specified. If the refrigerant type is&#13;
unknown, the WB/IFC conservatively assumes the refrigerant type to be HFC-R134a. This number is&#13;
converted to metric tons to calculate the total metric tons of CO2eq emitted.&#13;
Refrigerant data is often one of the hardest pieces of information for offices to collect. While every office is&#13;
provided an opportunity to report activity data where possible, WBGâ&#128;&#153;s online data management system&#13;
allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees or from those offices that cannot&#13;
collect the required data the option to default to estimated emissions for refrigerants. Estimates are included&#13;
for completeness, but they represent a small portion of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s emissions source, because its operations&#13;
do not require a high intensity of refrigeration. The WBG anticipates this data gap will improve in years to&#13;
come as data providers gain more experience in gathering the data.&#13;
         Quantifying Refrigerant Emissions from Vehicles&#13;
Refrigerants utilized in vehicles for air conditioning are a minute part of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s GHG emissions from&#13;
internal business operations. The WBG includes data on refrigerants from vehicles used globally.&#13;
Where available, the number of vehicles, grouped by each vehicle type, is multiplied by the standard&#13;
refrigerant charge per unit as outlined by the EPA. For example, all passenger cars are assumed to use R-&#13;
134a and have a charge per unit of 0.8, thus 8 passenger cars will have a total charge of 6.4 kg of&#13;
refrigerant. The total charge is then multiplied by the standard operating loss factor (20 percent) to arrive&#13;
at the annual refrigerant loss in kg. The annual refrigerant lost is multiplied by the global warming potential&#13;
of that refrigerant (most A/Cs are R-134a) to obtain the total metric tons of CO2eq emitted. (Figure 4)&#13;

Mobile GHG emissions result from the combustion of fuel in an organizationâ&#128;&#153;s owned and leased vehicles. In&#13;
accordance with the â&#128;&#156;operational control approachâ&#128;&#157; for organizational boundaries, the WBG reports data&#13;
for fleet vehicles that it owns and leases. All mobile emissions, regardless of location, are calculated using&#13;
the same methodology to ensure consistency in the quantification process.&#13;
         Quantifying Emissions from Mobile Sources&#13;
The majority of WBG offices report the quantity of fuel used from driver logs or invoices. Direct CO2&#13;
emissions from owned mobile combustion sources are calculated based on fuel purchase records, where&#13;
available. Many vehicles have fuel consumption logs to track their purchases.&#13;
&#13;
All transport fuel emissions factors are listed in Appendix C. The preferred approach to calculate mobile&#13;
sources is to multiply the volume of fuel by the fuel-specific CO2 emissions factors to calculate the total CO2&#13;
emissions as shown in Figure 5.&#13;

         Methodology for Estimating Emissions from Mobile Sources&#13;
When no transport fuel data is provided, the WBG makes estimates based on distance driven and fuel&#13;
economy of the vehicle type (Figure 6). For the purposes of calculating emissions, gasoline is assumed to be&#13;
the fuel used when estimating emissions in this fashion for sedans and motorcycles, and diesel is assumed to&#13;
be the fuel used when estimating emissions in this fashion for SUVs, light trucks and heavy trucks.&#13;

If mileage and fuel economy are not available, data providers are provided an option to report total&#13;
amount spent on fuel over the fiscal year, and the cost of fuel (in US Dollars) per gallon or liter in the city&#13;
location on average over the fiscal year. Data providers are also asked to indicate the type of fuel&#13;
purchased. Emissions estimates are then made based on the total fuel costs and the average cost of fuel per&#13;

Not all offices report mobile fuel use. Some do not have any owned or leased vehicles. The WBGâ&#128;&#153;s online&#13;
data management system allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees the option&#13;
to exempt himself/herself from reporting mobile fuel if the information is not easily accessible. In FY13,&#13;
there were a few cases where offices did not reply to the survey but had done so in previous years. In these&#13;
cases, data regarding fuel use in FY 13 was used as a proxy for FY 14 fuel use.&#13;
&#13;
In the United States, the EPA provides vehicle-specific emissions factors that are used to derive CH4 and N2O&#13;
emissions from vehicles. To calculate these emissions, fuel usage quantity is multiplied by CH4 and N2O&#13;
emission factors for the respective vehicle type. The CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions are then added to&#13;
quantify CO2eq. Since collecting precise car models from all country offices is a difficult task, country office&#13;
emissions calculations use one set of CH4 and N2O factors for each fuel type (gasoline, diesel, and LPG).&#13;
These standards have been set in place until more accurate data is available.&#13;

                                      ELECTRICITY PURCHASES â&#128;&#147; SCOPE 2&#13;
&#13;
The second scope of emissions under the GHG Protocol is indirect emissions from purchased electricity. These&#13;
emissions are classified as indirect because the emissions do not occur at the facility, but rather at the plant&#13;
where the electricity or steam is generated from fuel. These emissions are a consequence of the activities of&#13;
the organization because although the organization does not own or control the sources, its actions require&#13;
the generation of electricity. Organizations report emissions from the generation of purchased electricity that&#13;
is used by equipment or operations controlled by them. For many organizations, purchased electricity&#13;
represents one of the largest sources of GHG emissions and is the area where the most opportunities for&#13;
reductions in GHG emissions exist.&#13;
&#13;
Electricity activity data for each WB/IFC office is collected using one of three methods. The preference for&#13;
reporting the data is to use method one. If this data is not available, then method two is used, and as a last&#13;
resort, method three is employed.&#13;
&#13;
    WBG methods for reporting electricity data:&#13;
    1. Where possible, annual metered electricity usage (kWh) is reported for WBG offices in which the&#13;
       data provider was able to obtain information from electricity invoices.&#13;
    2. For WBG offices without separate meters, data providers are asked to provide electricity invoice&#13;
       data for the entire building, total area of the entire building, and area of IFC/WB-occupied space&#13;
       in the building We prorate the annual electricity usage based on the portion of IFC/WB-occupied&#13;
       area in the entire building, and the electricity use invoiced for the entire building.&#13;
    3. For offices that do not provide any data, estimates are based on regional electricity intensity&#13;
       (kWh/ft2) established from actual data provided from Method 1. This method is explained below&#13;
       in more detail.&#13;

         Quantifying Emissions from Electricity&#13;
GHG emissions from the generation of electricity include CO2, CH4, and N2O. GHG emissions are calculated&#13;
based on the amount of kWh purchased multiplied by the power plant emissions factor. WBG offices often&#13;
do not have enough information about the specific plants or power pools that provide them with power and&#13;
electricity. Therefore, for the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s facilities, GHG emissions from electricity usage are calculated based&#13;
on the amount (kWh) of electricity purchased and then multiplied by the subregion, region, or country-&#13;
specific emissions factor for CO2, CH4, and N2O.&#13;
&#13;
For electricity purchased in the United States, each year emissions factors are taken from the most recent&#13;
EPA eGRID to calculate GHG emissions. In accordance with EPA guidelines, previous yearsâ&#128;&#153; inventories are&#13;
not retroactively updated with the most recent emission factors. The emission factors used to calculate the FY&#13;
14 inventory come from eGRID 2014.&#13;
&#13;
The WBG uses region or country-specific emissions factors from IEA or country-based analogs for all other&#13;
locations. All emissions factors are listed in Appendix D. Figure 9 shows the GHG emissions calculation for&#13;
WBG locations where energy use amounts are provided. For some countries, IEA country-specific emission&#13;
factors do not exist. In these cases, region average CO2/kWh emissions factor are used as found in the IEA&#13;
document â&#128;&#156;CO2-highlights.xlsâ&#128;&#157;. To calculate CH4 and N2O emissions factors, the ratio of CH4 and N2O to&#13;
CO2 emission factors is calculated, which is then multiplied by the CO2 emission factor for each respective&#13;
GHG. For example:&#13;

         Methodology for Estimating Electricity Use&#13;
For offices that are able to provide electricity consumption for the entire building but not for the IFC/WB-&#13;
occupied area, annual electricity consumption is prorated for the IFC/WB-occupied area. This is&#13;
accomplished by dividing the IFC/WB-occupied space by the size of the entire building and then multiplying&#13;
this figure by the annual electricity consumption of the facility.&#13;

While every office is provided an opportunity to report activity data where possible, the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s online&#13;
data management system allows the data provider from an office with five or fewer employees the option&#13;
to default to estimated emissions for electricity use.&#13;
&#13;
For WBG offices that are unable to provide electricity consumption data, an estimate of annual electricity&#13;
use is calculated based on an IFC/WB regional electricity intensity figure and the area of the office&#13;
occupied (Figure 10). The intensity figure is calculated for each IFC or WB region by adding the annual&#13;
electricity consumption for each country office that responded within that region and dividing the sum by the&#13;
sum of the area of each office to generate an electricity consumption per area (kWh/ft 2) intensity figure.&#13;
This regional figure is then multiplied by the area of each non-responding country offices to calculate an&#13;
estimate of electricity consumption (kWh) for each country office. Tables 3 (WB) and 4 (IFC) show the&#13;
IFC/WB country offices that were used to calculate each regional average.&#13;

These numbers may change in the future as more comprehensive data is collected. In this instance, we would&#13;
recalculate previous years emissions for electricity based on the new electricity intensity averages. For now,&#13;
we will continue to use the FY 08 averages.&#13;

                            PURCHASED HEAT, STEAM, AND CHILLED WATER â&#128;&#147; SCOPE 2&#13;
&#13;
Indirect emissions also include emissions from heat, steam, and chilled water purchased for use in WBG&#13;
offices. Although the number of offices that purchase heat, steam, or chilled water is small, in the effort of&#13;
completeness we have decided to include these purchases. At the WBG Washington, DC offices, heat,&#13;
steam, and chilled water are not purchased.&#13;
&#13;
         Quantifying Emissions from Steam&#13;
Emissions from the purchase of steam are estimated based on the amount of steam purchased and an&#13;
assumed fuel type (natural gas) and boiler efficiency (80 percent) based on the EPA Climate Leaders&#13;
Guidance â&#128;&#156;Indirect Emissions from Purchases/Sales of Electricity and Steam .â&#128;&#157; Steam purchase can usually be&#13;
found on utility bills or other records. If steam purchased is communicated in mass instead of energy, the&#13;
mass should be converted to energy based on the heat content of steam (assumed to be 1200 Btu/lb). The&#13;
steam purchased (in units of energy) is divided by the boiler efficiency and then multiplied by emission&#13;
factor for each GHG for natural gas. Each GHG is multiplied by its GWP and added to calculate the CO 2&#13;
equivalent emissions from the purchase of steam (Figure 10).&#13;

         Quantifying Emissions from Chilled Water&#13;
Estimates for emissions from chilled water production are a small part of the overall World Bank Group&#13;
emissions inventory. In FY 14, only a few offices responded with information regarding their chilled water&#13;
purchases.&#13;
&#13;
The activity data used to calculate emissions resulting from purchases of chilled water are ton-hours and the&#13;
electric grid country/regional factor. A default estimate is used in the calculation unless site-specific data is&#13;
available regarding the chilled water supplier. A chiller efficiency of 0.75 kW per ton of cooling is assumed&#13;
as the default, which was obtained from the 2006 Buildings Energy Data Book, 2003 stock efficiency for&#13;
centrifugal chillers. This chiller efficiency is multiplied by the reported ton-hours of cooling to produce an&#13;
estimate of the electricity used. The estimate of the electricity used in chilled water production is then&#13;
multiplied by the country-specific emissions factors for CO2, CH4 and N2O, as is described in the estimation&#13;
of electricity emissions, above.&#13;

SCOPE 3 â&#128;&#147; OTHER INDIRECT EMISSIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     BUSINESS TRAVEL EMISSIONS â&#128;&#147; SCOPE 3&#13;
&#13;
Business air travel is representative of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s core business activities and a significant emissions source;&#13;
therefore, air travel is included as a voluntary Scope 3 emissions source in the inventory. Due to difficulty in&#13;
obtaining data for train and car rental, and the small proportion of associated emissions, these are&#13;
excluded from the inventory. This data may be included in future inventories.&#13;
         Quantifying Emissions from Air Travel&#13;
For the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s global operations, air travel data includes air travel for all WBG employees with an&#13;
identification number (UPI)â&#128;&#148;this includes contractors, consultants, and full-time staff. This data comes from&#13;
entries into a statement of expense reporting system that must be completed by all employees who travel.&#13;
The main purpose of this system is for staff to report all personal expenses related to a mission trip, so the&#13;
system captures all legs of a trip including stop-overs using city codes (for example, WAS for Washington,&#13;
DC). Each leg of the trip has an origin city code and a destination city code (for example, a round trip&#13;
journey from Washington, DC to Nairobi, Kenya with a stopover in Paris would be WASï&#131; PAR PARï&#131; NBO,&#13;
NBOï&#131; PAR, PARï&#131; WAS). The first step to calculate distance traveled by air travel in a given fiscal year is&#13;
that all city pairs from every leg of every mission trip approved and completed by WBG employees are&#13;
extracted from the travel expense system along with other relevant data. To calculate flight distances&#13;
between these city pairs, the city pairs are first checked against a Ticketed Point Mileage (TPM) table that&#13;
contains exact distances for city code pairs and, if not found in this table, against a Maximum Permitted&#13;
Mileage (MPM). The MPM table reflects the distance limit between two specified international points within&#13;
which passengers can travel at the direct fare, provided that the sum of ticketed point mileage distance is&#13;
not exceeded. If the city pair is not found in either of these, the trip is flagged as having a distance of 100.&#13;
&#13;
These unknown â&#128;&#156;100â&#128;&#157; distances are estimated in the following way:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    If the travel is within the same city, the trip is assumed to not be a flight and is not included in the&#13;
         calculation.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    If the travel is within the same country, the number of flight legs for that country is multiplied by the&#13;
         average within-country distance per flight leg for known flights to estimate the distance travelled.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    If the travel is not within the same country, the average known distance per flight leg originating&#13;
         from the country is multiplied by the number of flight legs departing from that country.&#13;
&#13;
Once a distance has been calculated for each trip, the air travel data is broken down by distance into three&#13;
categories for each leg (short haul, medium haul, and long haul). The definitions used are from the revised&#13;
â&#128;&#156;2010 Guidelines to Defra/DECC's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. Version 1.1 FINAL â&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#157;&#13;
(updated June 2010): a short-haul flight is less than 300 miles; a medium-haul flight is less than 2,300 miles;&#13;
and a long-haul flight is more than or equal to 2,300 miles. The emission factor for unknown flight distances&#13;
that have been estimated is calculated by taking the total kg of emissions from business air travel and&#13;
dividing it by the total number of passenger-miles for the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
To calculate air travel emissions for each flight category, the distance traveled and the appropriate GHG&#13;
emission factor is applied to obtain the emissions due to air travel (Figure 12). For a list of emissions factors,&#13;
see Appendix E.&#13;

         Note on Integration of the Radiative Forcing Index for Medium- and Long-haul Flights&#13;
Radiative forcing is the change in radiation received at the surface of the earth due to the emission of&#13;
greenhouse gases. High-flying aircraft spur radiative changes through three types of processes: direct&#13;
emission of radiatively active substances, such as CO2 and water vapor; emission of chemicals that produce&#13;
or destroy radiatively active substances, such as NOx; and emission of substances that generate aerosols or&#13;
lead to changes in natural clouds (for example, contrails). The radiative forcing index (RFI) is a measure of&#13;
the importance of these aircraft emissions on the atmosphere. The current, generally accepted, RFI factor is&#13;
2.7.&#13;
&#13;
Neither the United Kingdomâ&#128;&#153;s DEFRA, the ICAO, nor the United Statesâ&#128;&#153; EPA or WRI factor the RFI into air&#13;
travel emissions calculations despite the recommendation of the UNFCCC. Therefore, the WBG does not&#13;
currently integrate RFI into its GHG inventory for air travel. Both the WRI and the EPA are reviewing this&#13;
issue and may decide to integrate RFI into air travel emissions calculations. If international consensus is&#13;
reached on the appropriate application of RFI, the WBG will revisit this issue.&#13;
&#13;
                                   CONTRACTOR-OWNED VEHICLES â&#128;&#147; SCOPE&#13;
&#13;
Emissions from vehicles owned by contractors but used for World Bank Group business make up a small&#13;
proportion of WBGâ&#128;&#153;s emissions, but are included as a voluntary Scope 3 emissions source in the inventory.&#13;
Emissions are calculated in the same manner as those for Scope 1 mobile emissions, however as the number&#13;
of vehicles is not usually available and the emissions from vehicle refrigerants is considered de minimus,&#13;
emissions from vehicle refrigerants are not calculated.&#13;
&#13;
                                              MAJOR MEETINGS&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) host two major meetings each year to&#13;
discuss a range of issues related to poverty reduction, international economic development, and finance.&#13;
Annually, about 10,000 people attend the meetings, including on average 3,500 members of delegations&#13;
from the member countries of the Bank and the IMF, roughly 1,000 representatives of the media, and more&#13;
than 5,000 visitors and special guests drawn primarily from private business, the banking community and&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
Because these meetings are a key aspect of the way the WBG does business, they are included in Scope 3&#13;
emissions reporting. The delegates attending the meeting, while not WBG staff, are travelling to the meeting&#13;
site, staying in hotels, and using taxis to navigate around town because of the meetings, and therefore the&#13;
related emissions are considered to be under our operational control.&#13;
&#13;
Key emissions from these meeting include air travel emissions, electricity emissions from hotel stays and&#13;
mobile combustion emissions from within city transportation. Additionally, if the meeting is hosted at a non-&#13;
Bank owned facility, emissions from the venue are also calculated.&#13;
         Estimating Business Travel Emissions from Meetings&#13;
To estimate emissions from business travel related to major meetings, a list of delegate attendees is&#13;
obtained from a Conferences Officer from the Joint Secretariat for the Bank/Fund Conferences. Because the&#13;
meetings are hosted by both the WBG and IMF, the greenhouse gases assigned to delegates are divided&#13;
up so that the IMF assumes responsibility for all delegates coming from IMFC countries (see Appendix H). The&#13;
remaining countries are assumed to be representing WBG Member Countries. To estimate the air travel&#13;
emissions associated with their flights to Washington, DC, it is assumed that each delegate is flying round&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 19 | P a g e&#13;

&#13;
trip from the capital city airport to Washington Dulles (IAD) International Airport. Flight distances are&#13;
estimated using an online calculator (http://www.airrouting.com/content/TimeDistanceForm.aspx) and&#13;
multiplied by 2 to represent a round-trip flight. Each flight leg is then grouped into the appropriate short,&#13;
medium or long haul threshold (see the section on Business Travel Emissions, above), multiplied by the&#13;
appropriate emission factor, and summed to calculate air travel emissions for each meeting.&#13;
         Estimating Emissions from Hotel Stay for Meeting Delegates&#13;
The next largest source of emissions from major meetings is the electricity associated with the hotel stay from&#13;
each delegate. To estimate emissions associated with these stays, it is assumed that each delegate stays in a&#13;
hotel room by themselves for four nights (the meetings span 3 days and two nights). An average energy&#13;
consumption of 69.5 kWh/room/night is assumed, (personal communication with Manager â&#128;&#147; Social&#13;
Responsibility and Community Engagement for Marriott International). This total electricity consumption for&#13;
the stay is then multiplied by the appropriate electricity emissions factor for the location where the meeting&#13;
is hosted (in most cases this will be the emission factor for the RFC East subregion in the United States). These&#13;
emissions are then summed to calculate total hotel-room related emissions for the meeting.&#13;
         Estimating Emissions from Delegate Travel from Airport to Meeting Venue&#13;
The other source of emissions related to these major meetings is from delegate travel from the airport to the&#13;
meeting venue. A conservative assumption is made that most meeting delegates will travel by themselves&#13;
using taxis or other car services. For meetings hosted in Washington, DC, the distance is assumed to be 42&#13;
km, which is the distance by road from Dulles International Airport and the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Main Complex&#13;
building. This distance is multiplied by the number of attendees and by two to represent a round trip&#13;
voyage. It is then converted to miles and multiplied by the appropriate emission factor for grams of CO2-e&#13;
per passenger-mile (Appendix C), which are then summed to calculate total delegate travel from the airport&#13;
to the meeting venue.&#13;
         Estimating Emissions from Meeting Venue&#13;
Emissions from the meeting venue are another source of emissions related to organizing and holding a major&#13;
meeting. Every Spring Meeting and two out of every three Annual Meetings are hosted at the World Bank&#13;
and IMF premises and therefore the energy use from the meeting venue is already captured as outlined in&#13;
this IMP. If a meeting is held in an external venue, the preferred methodology for estimating emissions from&#13;
the energy consumed by the venue is to prorate the total annual energy use of the venue by the number of&#13;
days the venue is used for the meeting. For example, if a large convention center in Tokyo has an electricity&#13;
consumption of 50,000 MWh per year, and the Annual Meetings are hosted at this facility for 3 days, then&#13;
50,000 MWh is divided by 365 days and multiplied by 3 days to calculate the electricity consumption for&#13;
the meeting. This electricity consumption is then multiplied by the regional electricity emissions factor to&#13;
calculate the emissions related to the meeting venue.&#13;
&#13;

                                             DATA MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
ACTIVITY DATA AND DATA MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
         WBG Data Collection&#13;
The WBG continued to centralize GHG emissions data collection and management in FY14 by using a Web-&#13;
based inventory management database called Credit360. The online system, accessible to registered data&#13;
owners via http://worldbank.credit360.com, allows users to input activity data via a simple online survey&#13;
that collects information on energy use, refrigerant purchases, and business travel. Data is also collected on&#13;
recycling habits, volunteer hours, water use, financial donations, and energy efficiency initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
Data owners in country offices are typically resource management staff or designated â&#128;&#156;championsâ&#128;&#157; who&#13;
work with the appropriate staff to collect the necessary information. A notification is sent to data owners in&#13;
the first quarter of each fiscal year alerting them that annual Carbon Footprint Survey is available. The&#13;
system is secure and requires data providers (â&#128;&#156;Usersâ&#128;&#157;) to log in with a username and password. This method&#13;
also provides an audit trail, so it is clear which staff member is entering the data. Upon log-in, users are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   20 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12;                      The World Bank Group FY14 GHG Inventory Management Plan&#13;
&#13;
provided links to each office that they have been assigned, and answer questions in the form of an online&#13;
survey.&#13;
&#13;
As previously mentioned, offices with five or fewer employees are provided an option to (a) default to&#13;
estimated emissions for electricity use and refrigerants, and (b) to exempt the office from reporting on-site&#13;
fuel and mobile sources. These options are provided assuming the difficulty in obtaining this data, probable&#13;
inaccuracy, and the insignificant percentage it represents of the WBGsâ&#128;&#153; overall carbon inventory.&#13;
&#13;
In a few cases, offices have more than 5 employees but do not respond to the survey, either due to lack of&#13;
staffing, neglect or other reasons. In these cases, the Sustainability Coordinator in charge of the WBG GHG&#13;
inventory responds to the survey for the office, entering required information on office size, but triggering&#13;
the estimates for when no data is entered for electricity and refrigerant use by picking â&#128;&#156;Exempt-Less than 5&#13;
employeesâ&#128;&#157; so that the Credit360 system is prompted to use the estimates detailed in the sections above.&#13;
This was required for 21 WB offices and 10 IFC offices in FY 14.&#13;
&#13;
To collect GHG emissions at WBG facilities in Washington, DC, engineers, building managers, real estate&#13;
experts, travel management officers, and HR analytics officers identified in the â&#128;&#156;Management Toolsâ&#128;&#157; section&#13;
are asked to submit their respective data sets for the fiscal year.&#13;
         Data Sources&#13;
Scope 1 direct emissions data from on-site fuel use typically comes from fuel-purchase receipts or records&#13;
maintained by facility managers of owned buildings and from building managers or landlords for leased&#13;
buildings.&#13;
&#13;
Scope 1 emissions data for mobile sources typically come from fuel-purchase receipts. Where fuel purchase&#13;
data is not available, typically driver log information on fuel purchases or mileage is used.&#13;
&#13;
Scope 1 emissions data from fugitive refrigerant emissions come from service records from the landlord or&#13;
facility manager and are submitted to WBG data owners on an as-needed basis.&#13;
&#13;
Scope 2 emissions from electricity usage typically come from landlords for leased buildings and from&#13;
monthly electric utility bills for owned buildings.&#13;
&#13;
Scope 3 optional emissions data for business travel initiated from Washington, DC is reported through the&#13;
WBGâ&#128;&#153;s Travel Office, which uses a travel management contractor, currently American Express. American&#13;
Express creates itineraries for each travelerâ&#128;&#153;s trip and data is recorded in SAP through a Statement of&#13;
Expense system. Itineraries for global employees must also be recorded in the statement of expense system&#13;
for travel to be approved and authorized. This data is combined and summarized and reported at all&#13;
organizational levels, from vice presidential units (VPUs) down to the individual traveler.&#13;
&#13;
         Headquarters Specific: USA&#13;
Scope 1 emissions data from fugitive refrigerant emissions come from service records from the facility&#13;
contractor, Donohoe, submitted to WBG engineers on an as-needed basis.&#13;
&#13;
At the WB, the CR team coordinates the assignment of roles and responsibilities for GHG inventory data&#13;
management, collects relevant data from assigned staff, and then calculates the GHG inventory.&#13;
&#13;
At the IFC, the Footprint Program Officer coordinates the assignment of roles and responsibilities for GHG&#13;
inventory data management, collects the relevant data from assigned staff, and then calculates the GHG&#13;
inventory.&#13;

QUALITY ASSURANCE&#13;
&#13;
The WBG staffâ&#128;&#148;the WB CR team and the IFC Footprint Program Officerâ&#128;&#148;annually review the data&#13;
collection process during the inventory development process to improve accuracy and fill data gaps.&#13;
&#13;
To provide a level of quality assurance with the country office activity data, all office surveys are reviewed&#13;
in detail and clarifying questions are sent to key contacts. When clarifying information is not received, data&#13;
is taken out of the inventory if it has a large potential for error and will skew inventory results. In these cases&#13;
an estimate is made when possible. In the new data management system, Credit360, this whole process of&#13;
data entry, returned data, omitted data, and accepted data is captured for auditing purposes.&#13;
&#13;
Beginning with the FY 11 inventory, automated data validation was used in the data management system. If&#13;
data entered fell outside of pre-determined upper- and lower-bounds, an explanation was required by the&#13;
person entering the data with information on the percentage difference compared to the previous year. If&#13;
no explanation was given, the data survey could not be submitted to the approver. The thresholds for this&#13;
automated data validation can be found in Appendix I.&#13;
&#13;
Additional steps are taken to ensure the highest level of data quality:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·    To submit a survey, a data owner from a country office must have responded to all required&#13;
          questions.&#13;
     ï&#130;·    The Environmental Specialist for the World Bank reviews each response of the on-line survey once it&#13;
          has been submitted before it is merged into the main database. This staff member compares&#13;
          responses by looking at two things: 1) comparing the entry to the previous yearâ&#128;&#153;s response from the&#13;
          same office facility; 2) scanning for data points that may seem too high or too low for a particular&#13;
          activity data relative to the office size. If any clarifications or questions are required, the Env.&#13;
          Specialist uses the feedback modules available in Credit360 to query data points he may have a&#13;
          question about. The query is then sent to the data owner, who must address the query before re-&#13;
          submitting the data to the Env. Specialist for approval.&#13;
     ï&#130;·    Once the majority of data is submitted, the Env Specialist does a second level of quality assurance&#13;
          for electricity usage data since this is the second largest source of emissions (second to air travel).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    22 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12;                       The World Bank Group FY14 GHG Inventory Management Plan&#13;
&#13;
         The staff members exports data from Credit360 to calculate kWh usage per square meter for&#13;
         each office, and checks intensity figures for each office looking for any figures that are well above&#13;
         or below the average range for the region in which the office is located.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    If any are found, these data owners are contacted for supporting documentation and clarification.&#13;
         If the supporting documentation is not available or no real data can be found, the electricity&#13;
         consumption for the office is instead estimated based on the regional intensity figure.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    The electricity intensity report is then sent to the IFC Footprint Program Manager for further review&#13;
         to ensure all outlier figures have been identified and resolved.&#13;
&#13;
DATA GAPS&#13;
&#13;
Currently, data gaps exist for all emissions sources. The biggest gaps are for on-site fuel and refrigerant&#13;
leakage data from developing country offices; however, both of these represent a very small percentage of&#13;
the overall WBG GHG inventory (estimated less than 5 percent). Estimations are used to fill refrigerant&#13;
data gaps, and previous years data, where available is used to fill on-site fuel use gaps, as explained in&#13;
this IMP.&#13;
&#13;
Prior to the use WBGâ&#128;&#153;s Statement of Expense (SOE) system for global air travel data, air travel data had&#13;
the biggest data gaps. However, data from this new system now provides exact distances for the majority&#13;
of WBG staff air travel. The exception is for city pairs entered into the SOE system that are not matched up&#13;
on either the Ticketed Point Mileage (TPM) table or the Maximum Permitted Mileage (MPM) table, both of&#13;
which are used to calculate distances for each city pair. It is estimated that about 25% of air travel data&#13;
from the SOE statement falls under this data gap. Estimations are used to fill these gaps as explained in this&#13;
IMP.&#13;
&#13;
If a major known data gap is revealed, such as the reporting of a large amount of stationary fuel&#13;
combustion for one fiscal year in an office but a lack of data in the next, the data gap will be filled by first&#13;
making every effort possible to determine the activity data, and if this is not available, using the previous&#13;
yearâ&#128;&#153;s data. However, if it is known that there has been a major change in the size of the office, and actual&#13;
data is not available, the activity data will be estimated as detailed above.&#13;
&#13;
         Washington, DC specific&#13;
At the WBG Headquarters in Washington, DC, the following actions are undertaken to prevent errors:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    GSDCR and CR will assess the list of WB managementâ&#128;&#147;controlled properties to ensure that the&#13;
         inventory includes all leased and owned facilities, as well as to confirm the area where possible.&#13;
         CHRFM and FP will assess the list of IFC managementâ&#128;&#147;controlled properties to ensure that the&#13;
         inventory includes all leased and owned facilities, as well as to confirm the area of all existing&#13;
         space.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    GSDCR and CR will inventory each WB managementâ&#128;&#147;controlled facility for stationary fuel sources,&#13;
         including generators, boilers, and chillers. CHRFM and the FP will inventory each IFC managementâ&#128;&#147;&#13;
         controlled facility for stationary fuel sources including generators, boilers, and chillers.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    GSDCR and CR will review all WB fuel records for the year to ensure that logs and invoices are&#13;
         consistent with reality. CHRFM and the FP will review all IFC fuel records for the year to ensure that&#13;
         logs and invoices are consistent with reality.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    GSDCR and CHRFM will review utility bills provided by the utility company to ensure that the&#13;
         patterns are consistent with use. Upon changes to the bills, GSDCR will notify CR, and CHRFM will&#13;
         notify the FP, to update the inventory.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    All â&#128;&#156;ownersâ&#128;&#157; of WBG vehicles will be responsible for their own fuel logs and reporting. This includes&#13;
         GSDCR, GSDSO, and GSDMS.&#13;

DATA SECURITY&#13;
&#13;
Credit360 is a Web-based data management program based around an industrial strength database that&#13;
is scalable, fine-grained, and sophisticated. It is designed to run over standard security protocols such as SSL&#13;
for Web access.&#13;
&#13;

Information compiled for the purpose of the WBG GHG inventory will be maintained by WB CR and IFC FP.&#13;
Both teams have file backup protection standard to the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s data backup system.&#13;
&#13;
CORPORATE REPORTING FREQUENCY&#13;
&#13;
Facility data will be reported on an annual basis in time for annual inventory reporting, generally by the&#13;
end of the second quarter of the fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 BASE YEAR&#13;
&#13;
The WBG completed its first global GHG inventory in FY2007. The inventories in FY2007 and FY2008 were&#13;
for learning and educational purposesâ&#128;&#148;teaching country offices about carbon inventory data collection and&#13;
identifying data gaps. The FY2009 inventory was the first using a Web-based survey, and was also used as&#13;
a learning experience.&#13;
The IFC has identified FY 2008 as their base year for reducing electricity use per workstation in their&#13;
Washington, DC office.&#13;
The World Bank has set FY 10 as their base year for reducing emissions from managed and owned offices&#13;
by 10% by FY 17.&#13;
&#13;
ADJUSTMENTS TO BASE YEAR EMISSIONS â&#128;&#147; STRUCTURAL AND METHODOLOGY CHANGES&#13;
&#13;
Structural changes include mergers, acquisitions, and divestments and/or outsourcing or in-sourcing of GHG&#13;
emitting activities. Changes in the status of leased assets also are considered structural changes.&#13;
&#13;
Methodology changes include changes in activity data accuracy, changes in emission factors, changes in&#13;
electricity intensity or air travel intensity figures, and/or changes to the methodology used to calculate GHG&#13;
emissions.&#13;
&#13;
Discovery of significant errors in base year emissions calculations may necessitate a change in the base year&#13;
emissions inventory. Significant structural or methodology changes in future years may necessitate an&#13;
adjustment to the base year emissions to ensure that data are consistent and historically relevant. A&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Significance Thresholdâ&#128;&#157; requiring a change in the base year emissions would be a 1 percent change in the&#13;
total corporate-wide GHG emission inventory over or under the previous calculation (if no change were&#13;
made).&#13;
         Changes Due to New Emission Factors&#13;
If there is a change to published emission factor(s), the emission factors will be changed for each of the&#13;
previous years as well as the current year, provided they meet the 1 percent Significance Threshold. By&#13;
changing the emission factors for each of the previous reporting years, the emission calculations remain&#13;
historically consistent and relevant since the same factors are used throughout.&#13;
         Changes Due to Errors&#13;
Arithmetic and data entry mistakes can occur while recording and reporting emissions data. If errors are&#13;
identified during subsequent year inventory reporting that trigger the Significance Threshold, corrections to&#13;
the previous inventories will be made.&#13;
         Changes Due to Data Accuracy and Availability&#13;
If new data are available on source emissions that were not previously available or if new methodologies&#13;
result in obtaining more accurate data on source emissions, an adjustment to previous year may be required.&#13;
In such cases the Significance Threshold will be evaluated to determine if adjustments to the past years â&#128;&#153;&#13;
inventories are warranted.&#13;

 Records are maintained in the following fashion:&#13;
&#13;
 All utility records from electricity and natural gas consumption from owned buildings are kept in two forms: paper&#13;
 and electronic (in the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s accounting system, SAP). The paper form is filed twice within GSD. The process for&#13;
 electricity bills and for natural gas and diesel purchases for boilers and generators is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
    Invoice generated                 Invoice scanned                Original invoice               Duplicate paper&#13;

&#13;
 Diesel purchases for generators are recorded by the generator servicing company, Griffiths, as well as the engineer&#13;
 of the building containing the generator that was refilled. Griffiths sends a paper invoice that is filed with GSDCR as&#13;
 a hard copy. The hard copy of the bill is maintained by the World Bank.&#13;
 Refrigerant replacement and replenishment is recorded by the servicing company, Donohoe. Donohoe will submit an&#13;
 electronic report to the World Bank Contract Manager of each service instance with the quantity of refrigerant&#13;
 replaced or replenished. A hard copy of the report will be maintained by Donohoe in their World Bank office. The&#13;
 engineer for the building containing the chiller that was serviced will also maintain a copy of the file. The World Bank&#13;
 will maintain these records for three years as required by the EPA.&#13;

&#13;
 For leased buildings, records are maintained in the following fashion:&#13;
&#13;
 The World Bank, as a leased building tenant, does not have direct access to utility bills from our leased buildings.&#13;
 Landlords are contacted on an as needed basis (at least annually for purposes of the carbon inventory) to seek the&#13;
 information. In line with standard industry practice, the utility data is provided to the World Bank on a prorated scale&#13;
 by square footage. This information is received by e-mail and retained indefinitely. In the absence of concrete data,&#13;
 estimations are made based on intensity rates (kWh/ft2).&#13;

 Records are maintained in the following fashion:&#13;
&#13;
 All utility records from electricity and natural gas consumption from the IFC F building are kept in two forms: paper&#13;
 and electronic. The paper form is filed in the office of the IFC Chief Engineer, part of the Facilities Management&#13;
 team. The paper form is scanned, and electronic copies are stored in the shared network drive, and in the accounting&#13;
 software system, Avid, managed by Brandywineâ&#128;&#148;IFCâ&#128;&#153;s facilities management servicing company. On a monthly&#13;
 basis, the data is manually entered into spreadsheets organized by utility type (stored on IFCâ&#128;&#153;s shared network drive)&#13;

TRAINING&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s training procedure is to ensure that training that pertains to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s CR&#13;
Program, IFCâ&#128;&#153;s Footprint Program, and to the GHG inventory is maintained. Each WBG office will outline&#13;
their training procedure and update the IMP as necessary.&#13;
         Headquarters Specific: USA&#13;
At the WBG Headquarters in Washington, DC the task of maintaining the inventory is limited to the WBâ&#128;&#153;s CR&#13;
and GSDCR and IFC FP; thus, currently, training will be targeted to the specific needs of individual CR and&#13;
IFC FP staff and may entail the following:&#13;
     ï&#130;§ Attending relevant conferences,&#13;
     ï&#130;§ Reviewing GHG Protocol guidance annually&#13;
     ï&#130;§ Attending various trainings with outside groups, such as the GHG Institute e-learning, U.S. Green&#13;
         Building Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Department of Energy&#13;

&#13;
INTERNAL AUDITING&#13;
&#13;
The WBG will conduct a desktop review of the corporate GHG inventory each year. Based on this review,&#13;
any office triggering a Significance Threshold will in turn trigger the need for an internal verification review&#13;
of that site.&#13;
&#13;
EXTERNAL AUDITING&#13;
&#13;
The WBG will periodically hire a third-party, outside reviewer of the Inventory Management Plan and the&#13;
corporate GHG inventory. Should an external audit be warranted, the WBG will contract a third-party&#13;
audit. ERT-Winrock conducted a verification of the WBG FY07 inventory and IMP in FY08, while WSP&#13;
Environment and Energy reviewed the FY 09 Inventory and IMP in FY 10 and the FY 11 Inventory and FY 12&#13;
IMP.&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, the IMP and IFCâ&#128;&#153;s GHG inventory are reviewed annually as a part of the IFC annual rep ort&#13;
auditing procedures.&#13;
&#13;
MANAGEMENT REVIEW&#13;
&#13;
Annually, upon completion of the GHG inventory, the GHG inventory results will be presented to the World&#13;
Bank Corporate Responsibility Oversight Committee, comprised of senior management representatives from&#13;
SDN, GSD, Treasury, Corporate Finance and Risk and External Communications..&#13;
&#13;
CORRECTIVE ACTION&#13;
&#13;
Corrective actions will be implemented at the direction of the WB CR and IFC FP in response to a desktop&#13;
review and/or an internal or external audit identifying a Significance Threshold criteria item or other&#13;
significant structural or methodological issue that warrants corrective action. Such corrective actions will be&#13;
documented by changes to the IMP and/or the GHG Inventories. Changes to document, inventories, plans,&#13;
and so forth are subject to the IMP Document Retention and Control Policy.&#13;

 Note: N2O, CH4 were calculated using average vehicle fuel economy. WB/IFC only has volume (gallons or liters) of&#13;
 fuel consumption and the CH4 and N2O factors are per distance (mi or km) traveled. As a result, a corporate&#13;
 average fuel economy was assumed to be 22 mpg.&#13;

            The World Bank Group greenhouse gas
            emissions inventory management plan : for internal business
            operations 2014
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory
            Management Plan (IMP) outlines the World Bank Group's
            (WBG) endeavor to measure and manage greenhouse gas
            emissions from its internal global business operations. This
            document does not apply to the lending or technical
            assistance activities that WBG provides to its public and
            private sector clients. The IMP outlines the WBG's
            commitment to inventory and manage greenhouse gas (GHG)
            emissions for its internal global business operations and
            contains the WBG's greenhouse gas inventory
            methodology. It details the WBG's intention to create a
            GHG inventory that is similar to World Resources
            Institute's principles and guidance. It also discusses
            the WBG's intention to develop an initiative similar to
            the World Business Council for Sustainable
            Development's Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative for
            its internal corporate greenhouse gas accounting and reporting.
