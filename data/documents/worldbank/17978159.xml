it ia ayaptoaatic of Hr. Black that be absolutely paid no attention to         MC:   Reither one of these gentlemen is a natural orator.            I had worked&#13;

for Mr. Woods during the tiae I waa a consultant to hia 1 was to think         the body of his apeecbes 1 particularly the book of speeches that was&#13;

both men through making copious u1e of individuals within the Bank who                Mr. Black occasionally would ask that there be inserted in his&#13;
I thought bad something to say.      My method of operation was to sit down    speech aÂ· quote from someone. but. for the most part 1 there was no&#13;

&#13;
for him were bia Pilgrim' a addreaa and aeveral articles on lending for            HC:     There was never a question in my mind that Mr. Black wanted Hr.&#13;

education and lending for aariculture. Hr. Wooda waa aore interested in            Woods to succeed him at the Bank.     l;m not familiar with their personal&#13;

OLIVER:    Just for the record, you left the Bank â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ 7                          major underwriter of the Bank;s bonds while be was head of First&#13;
&#13;
HC:   The la1t day of December, 1966.     Ob, I left aa an eaployee in             Boaton.     It must have been because of the work Mr. Woods did in India&#13;
&#13;
December, 1961.                                                                    for Mr. Black at times when we were arguing the question of lending to&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Then there wa8 â&#128;¢ period of a year and a hâ&#128;¢lf when you were              publicly-owned industrial enterprises.     Mr. Woods had considerable&#13;
&#13;
back, virtually full ti.e in the Bank, as â&#128;¢ consultant.                            contacts with the Berlaa, particularly, in India, and I know he served&#13;
HC:   I operated out of my office.   I    didn~t   have an office in the Bank      on missions for Hr. Black.     Mr. Black at the time that I am talking&#13;
&#13;
when I worked for Hr. Woods.                                                       about had unrestrained admiration for Mr. Woods.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    But, over the years, you did maintain a pretty close relationship       OLIVER:     Can you abed some light on how he got to be the head of the&#13;
&#13;
with the Bank so that you would know the â&#128;¢ainstreaa of what was happening?         Bank?     Maybe you can say something about Dixon Yates.&#13;
&#13;
HC:   I worked for the Senate Comeittee on Foreign Relations, for                  HC:     When the Kennedy Administration came to Washington, we here in the&#13;
&#13;
Senator George Aiken, for about 10 years which involved all the                    Bank were concentrating not so much on Hr. Woods' fate as on Mr.&#13;
&#13;
legislation affecting the Bank that came up, and all foreign aid                   Black'â&#128;¢â&#128;¢     There is no question that Mr. Black was number two in&#13;

legislation.    I worked for the Treasury Department, always on                    coosideratio~    for Secretary of the Treasury in the kennedy&#13;
&#13;
assignment concerning the multi-national development banks.         I worked       Adminiatration.     He did meet with the President.   I'm quite convinced&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that he tbou&amp;ht be would get the appointment.          I can't prove that. and     Boston with the Dixon-Yates utility in Tennessee and Arkansas made it&#13;
&#13;
Marty Rosen would be the beat one to know.          I believe at the tiae          iaposaible for Mr. Kefauver to accept the nomination.     Mr. Woods was&#13;

tbia vaa 1961 --Mr. Black felt be val aoins to be Secretary of the                 informed by Ralph Dungan, then a young man on the Kennedy White House&#13;

Som.era left, the question of Mr. Black'a going waa on the table, but              OLIVER:     So Mr. Black left before hia third term was finished.    In&#13;
&#13;
until the Kennedy cabinet waa cboaen, Gene did not make it perfectly               fact, it waa hardly begun when he made the decision.&#13;

about the succession of preaidenta, aaybe we can talk a little bit                   OLIVE&amp;:   Well, can you comment on how that personal relationship&#13;
&#13;
about the end of Hr. Wooda' term and Mr. McH ..ara's comins.       Do you            continued, or did not continue, as the case may be?&#13;
&#13;
know whether Mr. Woods intended to serve only one five-year term?                    HC:   Well, anybody coming after Hr. Black would have had difficulties&#13;
&#13;
HC:      There ia no doubt in ay aind that Hr. Woods only intended to                in coping with the staff.     The immense loyalty, love is almost not too&#13;
&#13;
serve one tera.                                                                      strong a word, that moat of the staff had for Eugene Black, and his&#13;
&#13;
        The circuastancea of Hr. KcHaaara'a aovins froa the Defense                  outatandin&amp; international reputation, made it difficult for any&#13;
&#13;
Department to the World lank were ezplained to .e by Mr. Black, and I                successor.    And here comes Hr. Woods. a self made man--not an educated&#13;
can only quote what he aaid.      Be said the President had called him in:           man but with a very 1 very high I.Q â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ I think the brightest by far of the&#13;
11&#13;
     I think Bob is aoing to juap out the window like Forrestal.       Can we        three who were Bank presidents.      He was presented with a staff who&#13;
&#13;
get him over to the World Bank."      My guesa is that Hr. Woods knew much           said 1 nwell 1 Mr. Black did it this way 11 ;   11&#13;
                                                                                                                                          0f course. Mr. Black always&#13;
&#13;
more about thia than Mr. Black.      I know Hr. Woods had been in contact            did it this way 11   Any man coming into the Bank would have found that a&#13;
&#13;
with Mr. HcHamara while be vas Secretary, the last days while he was                 bit trying.&#13;
&#13;
Secretary of Defense.      My guess it that Mr. Woods played rather more of                 Mr. Woods never said anything to me that I could misconstrue to&#13;
&#13;
a role in Mr. KcNaaara'1 coming to the World Bank than Mr. Black did.           (I   be derogatory of Mr. Black. But then our relationship. as I said&#13;
should point out that Mr. Black at thia tUDe was special astistant to                before. was formal.     This is not the public's idea of a speechwriter--&#13;
President Johnson for Soutb-Baat Asia regional affairs.)                             like Sorenson and Kennedy for instance.          That is not the way I work.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Hr. Black and Hr. Woodâ&#128;¢ were quite clOte personal friends                But it was evident to me that Hr. Woods was highly motivated to put a&#13;
&#13;
before Mr. Woods became President of the World Bank?                                 stamp on the Bank which was not Black's.             I never knew what the stamp&#13;
&#13;
HC:      I think close personal friends is a little misleading.    Mr. Black         was that be wanted to put on the Bank.          For a man who was very&#13;
&#13;
had a great number of close perâ&#128;¢onal friends.       Whenever he travelled to         intelligent. he never enunciated a coherent theory of anything, but&#13;
&#13;
Annual Meetings, he would always invite a personal entourage. including              neither did Black.     This is an operating organization.          Until Mr.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                9                                                                            10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McNamara came along, who is a theoretician, there vas no theory that          period a change in the staffing of the Bank for these kinds of&#13;
&#13;

     Mr. Woods, however, increasingly made decisions which 1 felt were        other U.N. organizations?&#13;
&#13;
simply baaed on a deaire to create distance between bi.aelf and Hr.           HC:   You mean more and more?&#13;

&#13;
own and built the actual lendioa operations.     Woods aade a signal          HC:   The Bank staff baa never delegated anything to UNESCO or FAO of&#13;
&#13;
decision to alian the Bank vitb the other United Rations specialized          great value.    FAO, of course, bad a center for AGRO industry, about&#13;
&#13;
agencies, which Black had avoided like the plaaue._ (Be avoided them          which I know nothing.    The Bank association was and is very much prized&#13;
&#13;
partly becau1e he wanted to eatabli1b World Bank bonds in the world           by FAO, and there is UNESCO in a different form, a different way; but&#13;

to do with banking.)                                                          other than putting his own stamp on the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. Wooda changed tbia policy by eatabliahina relationships with     MC:   Well, look at hia personal appointments.   There were two. The&#13;
&#13;
FAO and UNESCO, which have grovu over the yeara.     His arguaent to me was   aajor one was Hr. Friedman from the Fund, and Mr. Friedman was a fish&#13;
that the Bank couldn't lend for a&amp;riculture and education becauae the         out of water.    He actually lasted into the McNamara years, and he is&#13;
Bank didn't have adequate etaff.     Therefore, the Bank muet draw on the     the only person I know whom Mr. McNamara actually fired.     I am not sure&#13;
ezpertise of theee other organization&amp;.      I pereonally did not find thia   if that ia accurate, but it was an agreement to part.&#13;
terribly couvincing. There waa a definite holier than thou attitude                  It was suggested that I act as Mr. Friedman's assistant because&#13;
among the Bank'e ataff towardâ&#128;¢ other U. N. agencies.      I believe Woods     he vas supposed to be the thinking machine for Mr. Woods.     That&#13;
waa motivated largely by the prestige of becoming a United Nations            relationship never developed.   Mr. Friedman used to talk to me&#13;
&#13;
figure and by doing eometbing Mr. Black refused to do.                        endlessly about the size of hia office compared to the size of Mr.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Just a aide queetion here:   Did you see over the years that      Demuth's office.    (Mr. Demuth had been sort of a house thinker for Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Woods waa in office and perhapa even eztending into Mr. McNamara's        Black, though that's more than what was the truth).     Many times I asked&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  11                                                                               12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Priedaan if would be like to auggeat aomethin&amp; for Mr. WOods to aay       much, except for the rate of disbursement, which is faster in so-called&#13;
in Toronto or London or wherever.     At DO tU.e did Mr. Friedman even        prograa Loans than in project !Dana.&#13;
make the â&#128;¢lightest suggestion, aor did be ever produce a draft of bia                   I think Mr. Wooda vas very interested in trying to use his&#13;

           I reaeaber the laat ti.e I aaw Jeffrey in retireaent in London          with Mr. Wooda.     My contract was renewed for the year 1966.                During&#13;

&#13;
to rethink the purpoaea of IDl.         I don'.t bl. .e Kr. Wooda for thia, I     function of lDl should be in relation to the Bank and the Monetary Fund.&#13;

do buaine ...     That waa not    Black'~   aeaaage- not that it waan',t true           You might want to trace the per-capita income curve in China for&#13;

Conareaa' 1 foreign aid burden.       U. s. was goina to put up forty percent     and put it over against the Indian curve.         There is little professional&#13;
&#13;
and the Europeans were going to put up 1ixty percent.          That waa the       reaearch in this.      To this day. no one has made a very serious attempt&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 19                                                                                         20&#13;

to answer the question:    Bow should IDA resources be allocated?      The       Mr. Black.      Mr. Woods did pave the way for the great expansion in&#13;

There is no evolution.    I don't bl.ae Hr. Wooda for that.    I can't say       education -- I think agriculture more than anything else.                I think if&#13;

MC:   Be becaae .ore cynical durin&amp; the ti.e I worked for him. 1 don't           rate at which the projects could be brought forth from the drawing board.&#13;

MC:    Until the day of Bretton Woods II coâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢Â·           I don'.t koov vben it         have any feeling for Woods', relationship with the            E.D.'~Â·   I do        know one&#13;
&#13;
will coae.     I think it will eoae, and aa &amp;rey aâ&#128;¢ you are aDd â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ bald as              thing:     he did inaiat that Livy Merchant, who was a very senior&#13;
&#13;
I .. , ve ai&amp;bt even live to aee it.                                                    diploaat, be the U. S. Executive Director.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVB&amp;:    Ooe laat question about Mr. Wooda: You have characterized               b~   OLIVER:       Livinaaton Merchant?&#13;
&#13;
aa bavia&amp; eoae difficulty in bia ltaff work partly because of the                       MC:    He waa the Aaaiatant Secretary for Europe at State and a&#13;
&#13;
adairation the ataff had for Hr. Black, partly becauae of bia own                       diatinguiabed Ambassador to MlTO.              I used to go to see Livy.        I knew&#13;
&#13;
per1onality, and partly because of out&amp;ide event&amp; ever which no one                     h~     slightly.     Livy bad nothing whatsoever to do, and be said, "I don"t&#13;
&#13;
would have bad. aucb control.                                                           know why I',. here.             George wanted me to be here, so I am here.''&#13;
&#13;
MC:    It would be very difficult to co.e after Hr. Black.                              OLIVE&amp;:       Merchant was an Executive Director â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Did tbeae difficultiea &amp;leo exteDd to hi&amp; relation&amp; with bia                 KC:    Yea.&#13;

&#13;
MC:    I clon'.t kuov.   Tbat'~   funny.    Black treated thea u    11&#13;
                                                                         concubinea"    McCloy bad eatabliahed the tradition that the American President of the&#13;
&#13;
that'a the word we uaed.       He waa terribly aolicitoua of thea in a                  Bank would have aort of a veto power over the choice of the u. S.&#13;
&#13;
aocial way.     Re would alvay1 include one on a trip he vaa takin&amp;. and                E.D.&#13;
they loved    b~   very auch aa the ataff did.       It ia, aa you know. a very         MC:    &amp;igbt.      Wbo waa the Standard Oil Executive who was the U. s.&#13;
&#13;
different job than beina an Executive Director of the lund.                They are     Executive Director of the Bank when Black cce in ",47?              A man whose&#13;
not part of aanaaeaent; it i1 very difficult to define what ia their                    naae you would reo.em.ber.&#13;
&#13;
job.   They do aot con1ider each loan foraally.            They conlider it after       OLIVBB.:      Collado.&#13;
&#13;
the loan haa already been decided.          They are lover rank aoveroaent              HC:    &amp;ailio Collado vas a man of substance.            Black said, ''If I take this&#13;
&#13;
officiala than the Directorâ&#128;¢ of the IMJ.           (I'~   talkin&amp; in generalitiea.)     job, Collado auat go I'' And be did.&#13;
&#13;
They telld to becoae nit-pickera.          Mr. Clauaen baa bad great difficult          OLIVER:       Actually McCloy did.&#13;
&#13;
with thea. aore ao than anybody.           HcN..ara. becauae of bia preatige,           HC:    Ob be did.        I'pa&#13;
&#13;
probably did oot have any trouble.           I boneatly don'1t know what the            OLIVER.:      How you are suggesting that aa late as Hr. Woods".&#13;
&#13;
relationahip vas.        McNâ&#128;¢ara didn',t court thea the way Gene did.           Gene    a&amp;Diniatration, the President of the Bank in effect still had the veto&#13;

&#13;
MC:    All I know ia that    ~.   Wooda inaiated on having Livy Merchant.              you rely on in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Merchant repreaented to Mr. Wooda       vbat~    would like to be:   Livy vaa          MC:    I alwaya picked in every instance, without exception, a middle&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
OLIVBI:     Did be reaain Ezecutive Director tbrouab the entire Wooda                  was a way of educating myself.         It was a matter of trust, and it would&#13;

&#13;
MC:    Ro, but I don't know when be left.        tbe D. S. E. D. doesn't really        order.     They were the subject of enormous staff work and computer&#13;

Black'a tL.e.      Be vaa difficult, intruaive.      When be had a difficult           ever read McH...ra'a speeches, you know they are volume&amp;.&#13;

&#13;
say to .e, ~. I think we ouabt to aet Lyndon and Gene together for                     it.    It ai.ply ian't news.   It isn't interesting.      It is boring.          But&#13;

lunch,â&#128;¢ 10   we   can do thi1 and that.     I didn't know what to do about it.         reporterâ&#128;¢ did take the licenae of deciding to write the apeech for him.&#13;
Be i1 â&#128;¢till around tovn 1a.ewhere.          Be aot iDto 1oae kind of trouble a         I don't like that.     Black's stuff came out as I wrote it.        Woods' did&#13;

OLIVER:     Did you ever 1it in on .eetinaa of the Ienior ltaff7                       he made a f ..oua Montreal speech, but not a word of that speech did&#13;
&#13;
MC:    Very rarely.    I avoided .eetinaâ&#128;¢ like the plaaue.      Americana do not       anyone ever quote or remember.     But they do quote "Development&#13;
&#13;
