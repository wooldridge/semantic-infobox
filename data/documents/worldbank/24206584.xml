water scarcity for irrigation, wastewater is recognized as a source  The hectares under irrigation are mostly in areas of high water stress,&#13;

KEY LESSONS&#13;
Although farmers are cognizant of the potential risk of irrigating&#13;
with reused water, they do not have enough specific knowledge&#13;
about either the advantages or problems associated with using&#13;
wastewater to irrigate food products. As a result, the protection&#13;
measures they take are limited, although they report frequent use&#13;
of some types of protection. Almost 60 percent of the respondents&#13;
recognize risks and problems for health, citing primarily the strong&#13;
likelihood of rheumatic, lung, gastrointestinal, and skin diseases,&#13;
and to a lesser extent, diseases affecting their livestock. This,&#13;
however, still leaves a sizable portion of the community unfamiliar&#13;
with the risks.&#13;
Farmers in the region support water reuse schemes and are willing&#13;
to contribute to their success, but their contributfons would likely&#13;
not result much of a contribution to the construction or sustai-&#13;
nability of reuse infrastructure. The sector authorities who were&#13;
interviewed recognize that there are no criteria for setting rates&#13;
for reuse of wastewater, and payments or contributions in kind&#13;
or in labor for irrigation systems are not recognized as rates but&#13;
rather as contributions for repairs and corrective maintenance. In&#13;
the 12 municipalities that participated in the initial focus group&#13;
portion of the study, when farmers made voluntary payments to&#13;
finance operation and maintenance of systems, according to study &#13;

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS&#13;
As noted, the informal use of wastewater for agricultural irrigation&#13;
is standard practice in Bolivia. This informal reuse often occurs&#13;
downstream of outfalls of wastewater that is untreated (La Paz) or&#13;
insufficiently treated (Puchukollo) to achieve acceptable risk levels&#13;
for the health of farmers and consumers.&#13;
Reducing health risks by increasing treatment coverage and im-&#13;
proving the performance of existing plants, while necessary, entails&#13;
large investments in rehabilitation and new construction and thus&#13;
lengthy implementation times. For this reason, and to contain the&#13;
risks inherent in consuming farm products that are already being&#13;
irrigated with wastewater, other complementary measures with&#13;
short- and medium-term impacts must be adopted in parallel,&#13;
such as those proposed by WHO.&#13;
An economic rationality principle would offer solutions under a&#13;
multibarrier approach, as proposed by WHO in its 2006 guidelines.&#13;
This approach would bring about the same degree of reduction in&#13;
health risks associated with reuse based on treatment requirements&#13;
that are less demanding and thus entail lower investment costs&#13;
than wholesale infrastructure construction. WHO proposes the&#13;
adoption of measures such as crop restrictions; use of irrigation&#13;
techniques that minimize contamination; introduction of mi-&#13;
nimum waiting periods between last irrigation and harvest;&#13;
promotion of hygienic food preparation practices; education on&#13;

            Supporting poor-inclusive water and
            sanitation sector reform : wastewater reuse for irrigation
            in Bolivia production, commercialization, and consumption of
            wastewater irrigated crops in the Altiplano region
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The informal use of untreated wastewater
            for agricultural irrigation, either through direct
            application or diluted in natural waterways, is standard
            practice in Bolivia. At least 5,000 hectares of land are
            irrigated with wastewater, 86 percent in the departments of
            La Paz and Cochabamba, with the majority in the vicinity of
            metropolitan areas. The practice of water reuse in Bolivia
            shows that in a scenario of water scarcity for irrigation,
            wastewater is recognized as a source of water for
            agriculture. This bodes well for the sustainability of
            agriculture in the region. Wastewater is reused to
            compensate for the ensuing lack of uncontaminated water
            resources. In some cases, the concentration of wastewater
            flows that accompany urban growth not only meets the
            preexisting demand for irrigation but also drives an
            increase in agricultural activity. Bolivia&#146;s national plan
            of basic sanitation 2008-2014 anticipates that as a result
            of the effects of climate change, the volume of available
            surface water will decrease and water tables will drop,
            which may lead to overuse of aquifers, incremental costs for
            supplying water, and a likely loss of water quality. This
            study was aimed at complementing said initiatives - which
            were focused on financial and technical aspects of
            wastewater reuse. The Altiplano farmers (El Alto and
            Viacha-Chonchocoro), too, identify advantages related to
            less need for fertilizers, greater productivity, and not
            having to pay to reuse water. Farmers in the region support
            water reuse schemes and are willing to contribute to their
            success, but their contributions will likely not result much
            of a contribution to the construction or sustainability of
            reuse infrastructure.
