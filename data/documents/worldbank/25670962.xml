ï»¿ANNEX 1&#13;
Part H Europe 2020 Trust Fund Description&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the&#13;
Trust Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
1. Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Trust Fund are:&#13;
The European Commission and the Bank share a common objective of building competitive and&#13;
sustainable economies and reducing poverty and social exclusion - goals of the Europe 2020 Agenda&#13;
which is built on three pillars of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The European Commission&#13;
and the Bank concur that direct interaction is beneficial to both institutions and through them to the&#13;
beneficiary countries. This applies particularly to the provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge&#13;
services and technical assistance.&#13;
The European Commission has expressed an interest in ensuring that the Bank continues to provide&#13;
technical assistance in the framework of the Trust Fund in furtherance of the common objective set&#13;
forth above.&#13;
2. Activities&#13;
The objectives and description of the activities are:&#13;
The European Commission has expressed an interest in ensuring that the Bank provides technical&#13;
assistance in the framework of the Trust Fund with the specific objective of assisting and supporting&#13;
the Government of Greece (GoG) to undertake reforms that improve the business environment of&#13;
Greece with particular attention to the regulatory system for investment licensing (IL). The&#13;
Activities (which may be described as "components" of activities) to be financed by the Trust Fund, in&#13;
support of the objective above, and of which the Bank has implementation responsibility, are&#13;
described below.&#13;
Broadly defined, investment licenses comprises all transactions and costs of all associated fees,&#13;
completed and incurred, respectively, to obtain all of the registrations, licenses, permits,&#13;
authorizations, inspection certificates, consents and approvals that an enterprise must acquire to begin&#13;
operations. In addition, investment licenses comprise all of the information and assessments an&#13;
enterprise is required to provide throughout the process of authorizing the start of operations. Finally,&#13;
the process of obtaining investment licenses also comprises compliance with all rules, regulations and&#13;
other investment agreements an enterprise must conform to as it proceeds from conceptualization of an&#13;
investment in Greek territory to initial business operation.&#13;
e  a in Greece fnr nvetors are the barriers caused by the multiple and&#13;
fragmented permits and licenses which are required to start and carry an activity. In May 2014 the&#13;
Greek parliament adopted the Framework Law on Investment Licensing Reforms (IL law, 4262/2014).&#13;
The IL law, subsequent secondary legislation, and implementation measures and mechanisms will&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿establish a new set of principles and practices for the regulation of economic activities in Greece.&#13;
Effective implementation of the IL Law should introduce more efficiency, transparency and clarity in&#13;
investment licensing leading to a reduction in the delays and costs (including corruption) incurred by&#13;
investors seeking to start an activity in Greece and throughout the business lifetime.&#13;
The implementation of the IL Law entails a complex and very significant reform process that is&#13;
expected to take some years to be accomplished:&#13;
*   A range of existing regulation will not be consistent with this new legal and regulatory&#13;
framework, and will need to be identified, reviewed, and repealed or revised.&#13;
*   Technical requirements, if found to be less than fully adequate, will also need some revisions&#13;
or additions.&#13;
*   Most importantly, the reform requires a profound transformation in the way regulatory bodies&#13;
work and deliver regulation - less reliance on ex ante licenses, introduction of streamlined&#13;
processes, e-regulation, risk-focused ex post controls, etc.&#13;
The Bank would contribute to the GoG efforts on above mentioned aspects and comprise in this&#13;
Agreement the licensing review in additional areas than those covered under activities carried out&#13;
under the Administration Agreement between the Bank and the Commission (TF072514/ 30-CE-&#13;
0748365/00-74) with the aim to achieve the highest possible reform impact and provide robust&#13;
recommendations on the type of revision needed, the development of technical requirements in areas&#13;
not covered under the TF072514, and support the roll-out and implementation of the new licensing&#13;
system in 1-2 pilot regulatory areas. The latter will include several activities notably to help improve&#13;
inspections and enforcement practices, the development of a new "regulatory delivery" approach&#13;
including emphasis on information and compliance support for businesses, and the training and&#13;
support to staff transition to new roles.&#13;
This support will be essential for the GoG to achieve its goal of moving towards a more streamlined&#13;
and simplified investment licensing and a more effective regulatory system for businesses, and helping&#13;
Greece become one of the few Member States relying on risk focused ex-post controls (which are&#13;
more efficient than prescriptive ex-ante regulation).&#13;
The following outputs will be delivered by the Bank:&#13;
Component A. Review of licensing regulations in select priority sectors&#13;
A. I Selection of priority areas. The Bank, Core Team' (or its successor), and Commission/SRSS will&#13;
consult on a set of priority economic activities/sectors for the review of licensing regulations with the&#13;
aim to achieve the highest possible reform impact. The selected economic activities/sectors will be&#13;
The Core Team will be set up by the GoG to provide technical support to the Project Management Team (PMT)_ The Core Team will work&#13;
closey wmtAI&amp; tgckslon memos prepared by the Bank, as well as&#13;
facilitating the contacts of the Bank with other competent authorities, experts, and institutions related to the scope of the project.&#13;
Furthermore, the Core Team will forward, in whatever way it deems appropriate, the comments of the sub-working groups that will be set up&#13;
by the GoG in relation with the implementation of the project. The Core Team will be comprised of personnel from the General Secretariat&#13;
of Industry of the Ministry of Economy, Growth, and Tourism.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿additional to those covered in the review of licensing regulations under the TF0725142 The licensing&#13;
review in this component will not automatically cover all remaining licenses. Rather, it will follow&#13;
principles of prioritization and economic relevance that allow to maximize the positive impact of the&#13;
reform, and an effort to include more complicated reform cases not covered in TF0725 14.&#13;
A.2. The Bank, in consultation with the Core Team, will, for each economic activity selected in&#13;
Component A. 1, prepare a decision memo indicating, for each regulatory area, what the risk level is,&#13;
and which regulatory instrument(s) is/are appropriate (no additional regulation, General Operating&#13;
Conditions, mandatory standards and third-party certification, or ex-ante license). The decision memos&#13;
will include specific references to the legal text in need of revision, and what revisions are required.&#13;
The decision memos will also include references to one or more relevant EU or OECD examples that&#13;
show how the proposed solution is in line with good practice. The preparation of the decision memos&#13;
may be done, when applicable, in the framework of the relevant working groups, and/or incorporate&#13;
the results of discussions held in these working groups.&#13;
A.3. The Bank, in consultations with Core Team, will summarize the decision memos in Component&#13;
A.2 into a short report giving the list of all activities in selected priority sectors to be covered by ex&#13;
ante licenses, mandatory standards and third-party certification, General Operating Conditions (and&#13;
the regulatory areas covered by these instruments) - and the list of economic activities (and the&#13;
regulatory areas for each of them) for which existing licenses could be fully cancelled and no&#13;
additional regulation imposed.&#13;
A.4. The Bank will review the relevant draft Presidential Decrees and (Joint) Ministerial Decisions&#13;
prepared by the legal experts of the Government of Greece to review whether the content reflects the&#13;
recommendations made in the Decisions Memos.&#13;
Component B. Development of technical requirements4&#13;
B. 1. The Bank will prepare a list of economic activities for which the results of the licensing review&#13;
indicate that a revision of the underlying mandatory technical requirements' is required. This list&#13;
2 Examples of areas expected to be covered under TF072514 include tourism, food and beverages industry, catering and hospitality, and&#13;
mining.&#13;
'Examples of possible criteria to select these priority activities/sectors include: i) Relevance to the Greek economy, e.g. high share of GDP&#13;
and/or employment ii) Potential for growth (in particular for increases in exports, employment, investment) based on underlying competitive&#13;
advantage; iii) Available evidence suggesting that these activities/sectors are strongly/significantly hampered by the existing licensing regime&#13;
(e.g. number of types of licenses affecting these activities); and iv) Licensing volumes (number of licenses issued per year for a given&#13;
sector/activity).&#13;
rhe IL Law and reform process foresee the move from an essentially ex ante regulatory regime to one that relies significantly more on ex&#13;
post processes. This requires not only adequate attention to capacity and structures for supervision, inspections and enforcement, but also in&#13;
some cases may require the development of new mandatory technical requirements, or changes to existing ones. This could be in areas where&#13;
a) licensing has hitherto been the main regulatory basis, b) said licensing is proposed for elimination, c) existing technical requirements are&#13;
found to be wanting, and d) as a result a regulatory gap may appear leaving significant risks insufficiently regulated. It may also be in cases&#13;
where, regardless of the choice of regulatory instruments (licensing, notification, free establishment etc.), mandatory technical requirements&#13;
are excessively burdensome and/or outdated, and will thus limit business creation/growth. Depending on the specific case, addressing this&#13;
regulatory gap may be done either through: a) amendments to, or introduction of, mandatory technical requirements through primary or&#13;
secondary legislation (with the precise instrument to be identified for each case).&#13;
5 Sector-specific legislation and norms, applicable to active establishments regardless of whether a license is needed or not - regardless of the&#13;
legal instrument used to establish these requirements.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿will be distinct from the list to be prepared under TF072514. The list may be updated from time to&#13;
time based on the progress of the licensing review. From this list, the Core Team, Commission/SRSS,&#13;
and Bank will consult on the selection of a limited number of priority activities/sectors (based on their&#13;
economic relevance) for which mandatory technical requirements require revision (through whichever&#13;
adequate legal instrument), without which the beneficial impact of the licensing reform may not be&#13;
(fully or partly) achieved.&#13;
B.2. The Bank will prepare inputs to draft technical requirements (using whichever legal instrument&#13;
has been identified as appropriate) for selected activities identified under Component B.1. This is&#13;
expected to include elaboration of new technical requirements for only (at most) a very limited number&#13;
of priority areas. The Bank will support the dedicated body to be set up by the Government of Greece&#13;
for the specific purpose of drafting such mandatory technical requirements.&#13;
Component C: Support to reform roll-out and implementation in 1-2 pilot regulatory areas&#13;
This component will aim at piloting the roll-out and implementation of reform, including&#13;
transfornations in inspections and enforcement practices, development of a new "regulatory delivery"&#13;
approach including emphasis on information and compliance support for businesses, training and&#13;
support to staff in transitioning to new roles, etc. This component will target 1-2 regulatory areas&#13;
(depending on reform readiness, complexity of implementation etc.). The areas/agencies will be&#13;
selected through consultations between the GoG, Bank and Commission/SRSS, based on their&#13;
relevance to the economy and business development, their readiness to change, their capacity and&#13;
resource availability.&#13;
C. L Institutional changes: The Bank will prepare a report summarizing recommended institutional&#13;
changes in selected pilot area(s), including options for mandates, spheres of competence, national vs.&#13;
local responsibilities, etc. of licensing, inspection, and enforcement authorities. This (and subsequent&#13;
activities) will take into account existing and planned administrative and civil service reform&#13;
programs, as well as good international and EU practice.&#13;
C.2. License issuance processes and procedures: The Bank will prepare recommendations for the&#13;
selected agency (or agencies) regarding streamlined processes and procedures to issue licenses that&#13;
ensure full transparency and efficiency. The recommendations will be aligned with the specifications&#13;
for the licensing IT system developed under TF072514.&#13;
C.3. Internal procedures and governance: The Bank will prepare recommendations for the selected&#13;
agency(ies) with respect to transforming their internal procedures for decision making, appeals,&#13;
review, complaints, etc., as well as the way they are governed, including performance management,&#13;
staff performance evaluation, senior appointments, strategic decisions, etc.&#13;
C.4. Transformation in staff roles, competences, assignments, and tasks: The Bank will prepare&#13;
recommendations for the selected agency(ies) on new terms of reference for staff, reallocating&#13;
resources, and developing new missions (information/awareness, compliance assistance, enforcement&#13;
etc.). This will be directly connected to the reforms identified in C.2 and C.3 above. The Bank will&#13;
also provide selected training aimed at transforming staff competences and culture.&#13;
G&amp;. Outreach, awareness, compliance promotion: The Bank will provide recommendations to the&#13;
selected agency(ies) on how to develop an approach to compliance promotion, including broad&#13;
outreach and awareness raising on the requirements to be complied with and the risks being addressed.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿C.6. Inspections and enforcement: To support the move from a primarily ex ante regulatory&#13;
approach to a risk-based ex post one, for one or more types of business inspections, the Bank will&#13;
prepare, with support from the Core Team, draft tools for inspectors (e.g. check-lists for the most&#13;
important sectors) and risk-proportionate enforcement guidelines. The Bank will also provide advice&#13;
on the adequate use and implementation of new information technology tools for planning and&#13;
recording of inspections. This will complement the preparation of new inspector competences and&#13;
roles in C.4 above and the draft inspections targeting methodology in TF072514.&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the&#13;
Trust Fund between the Bank and the Donor it being understood that any plural references in the&#13;
annexes to Donors, Administration Agreements, Contributions and pro rata shares shall be read as&#13;

1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donor,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or&#13;
trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement&#13;
shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of&#13;
Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;

GOVERNANCE FOR THE ACTIVITIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 2 OF ANNEX 1 TO&#13;
THIS ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between&#13;
the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
Working Modalities&#13;
The Bank will be in charge of the implementation of the activities and shall consult with the Structural&#13;
Reform Support Service (SRSS) regularly.&#13;
SRSS will take all appropriate measures to facilitate the Bank work in the performance of the&#13;
activities, including, facilitating contacts with Greek authorities and facilitating the creation of an&#13;
inter-ministerial coordination mechanism.&#13;
The activities will be undertaken in close collaboration with the SRSS, and the Greek correspondent&#13;
(the Secretary General for Industry) from the Ministry of Economy, Growth, and Tourism (MoEGT).&#13;
In order to facilitate the implementation of the project, the SRSS will be responsible for involving&#13;
other EU Commission services, where appropriate. SRSS will also provide support to ensuring the&#13;
appropriate involvement of the Government of Greece for the smooth execution of the activities by the&#13;
Bank. The SRSS will provide the Bank with relevant documents, reports and findings, resulting from&#13;
other technical assistance work streams the SRSS is or has been involved in. It will also inform the&#13;
Bank team of relevant developments under the economic adjustment programme and consult with the&#13;
Bank when contracting consultants who may contribute to the investment licensing reforms.&#13;
The Bank shall report to the Commission on the implementation of the Action in accordance with the&#13;
Framework Agreement. In particular, the Bank will deliver quarterly progress reports in accordance&#13;
with Article 5.3 of the Framework Agreement.&#13;
The Bank and SRSS will have regular exchanges on the progress of the project, on the work plan or&#13;
schedule of project activities for the following month(s) including missions, and raise any issues as&#13;
they arise concerning difficulties encountered. A Representative of the SRSS will be invited to attend&#13;
all pertinent events or activities.&#13;
Priorities and choices to be made in the planning of the activities will be discussed and consulted&#13;
between the Bank and SRSS. To facilitate the organization and efficiency of missions the Bank will&#13;
share with the SRSS in a timely manner the relevant documents.&#13;
It is expected that the Secretary General for Industry of the MoEGT (or its successor) will be the&#13;
national contact Point for the activities, in collaboration with the Secretariat General for Coordination,&#13;
and will coordinate the necessary inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms and will maintain a&#13;
-Project Management Tgam_ composed of s.enior4oAtesumoi;t offieials and with suppott fi oi n the Prime&#13;
Minister's Office in order to ensure ownership of the process and guide the continued reform.&#13;
It is expected that the Bank will work with the Core Team (or its successor) responsible for the&#13;
screening and analysing of existing licensing regulation and the provision of specific&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿recommendations for revisions of current licensing regulation. It is expected that the MoEGT will&#13;
provide input for the analysis of the Bank; comments on the work plan of the project; review draft&#13;
outputs and comment on relevance of policy recommendations developed by the Bank. It is expected&#13;
that the Bank will consult and cooperate with the Project Management Team at all major stages of the&#13;
activities to be implemented.&#13;
It is expected that the Bank will work with any working group(s) that may be established as per&#13;
Council of Ministers Act No. 21. The Bank may also work with other operational ad-hoc working&#13;
group(s) of the Greek administration (including central and local authorities), if this proves necessary.&#13;
The continued involvement of private sector stakeholders as well as relevant ministries and agencies is&#13;
considered essential for the reform to be adequately designed and successfully implemented. It is&#13;
expected that the Bank will discuss, where appropriate with Greek stakeholders, businesses, and&#13;
business associations active in the selected sectors.&#13;
Bank team composition:&#13;
The Bank shall, in its sole discretion, determine the composition of the staff (including staff holding&#13;
consultant appointments) assigned to perform the activities under this Agreement. The Bank team will&#13;
be managed by a Bank Task Team Leader with at least 10 years of relevant experience, drawing on the&#13;
expertise of the World Bank Group staff including personnel and consultants/ experts contributing to&#13;
specific segments of the activities in, among others, the following areas: economy; business licensing;&#13;
business processes; law; IT; and design and implementation of institutional and e-govemance reform,&#13;
including interpretation and translation services. A local project coordinator will facilitate and support&#13;
the activities to be implemented under Annex 1 to this Agreement. The Bank team will include the&#13;
following competencies:&#13;
-  Ability to analyse regulatory systems for business licensing, notably in the EU.&#13;
-  Ability to translate analysis into recommendations for regulatory and legislative changes&#13;
related to business licensing, particularly taking into account the local institutional setting and&#13;
socio-economic environment.&#13;
