&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bank' s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A/&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: .. in the beginning is only for requirements [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But they must have started financing local cost components rather early on in&#13;
Indonesia, didn't they? Or not?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yeah, in a way, when-so that was--if you look at the--so these things&#13;
are very difficult because you say it' s "early" or "not early.."&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I understand that, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCH T AR: But when we found out that it's {inaudible] to have the local funding&#13;
because ofthe problems that we faced with the local--what do you call it--local portion of&#13;
the financial, portion of the rupiah, yeah, then of course, there's an understanding from&#13;
the Bank it would participate as a party in the total . ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes. The public works category does not cover irrigation?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, does it cover irrigation?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: Irrigation, water resource development, kampungs irrigation, and also&#13;
the water resources development.&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWN MAN: Roads, flood control.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Drainage?&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWN MAN: Drainage walls.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Maybe what we should give you is the brochure ofthe activities of&#13;
Public Works.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And the irrigation includes the minor irrigation through the major?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Everything: wells to large dams and canals?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: Yes. So in the beginning was like this, yeah: when we first had the&#13;
funds that we, the loans from the Bank come for small, for rehabilitation.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS : Yes, uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: That was the frrst five years and so, and then gradually we start with--&#13;
what we call it--the new developments, yeah, but we start first with the rehabilitation and&#13;
then gradually the improvement of the existing and thus it developed into the new&#13;
projects in infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You mean in different areas of infrastructure or just dams?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Oh, oh, the first five-year development plan of the whole of Indonesia&#13;
was after the so many--what we call it--delayed activities and so, and then the main thrust&#13;
was more on rehabilitation {inaudible} Indonesia. Projects were rather small, yeah, and&#13;
scattered. Â·&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This would be ' 68 through the early ' 70s, something like that?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Rehabilitation of what?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Water resources development, irrigation, roads and electricity.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Rehabilitation after all the troubles of the middle ' 60s, I suppose. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes, yes. And before that, yeah, most of the activities was not on&#13;
operations maintenance, that creates the plan of the functioning of the infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That was the first five-year plan?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: The frrst five-year plan was on rehabilitation, and development of the&#13;
new projects was gradually started early second five-year plan.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And what was the function of the Bank? Was it mostly to provide resources,&#13;
money, or was it ..&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: And technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Technical assistance. And that was from Bank staff themselves or from&#13;
consultants?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Both.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Both.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Both. We were fortunate the Bank staff has decreased in numbers&#13;
[inaudible] numbers, that creates a--what you call it--closer cooperation between the&#13;
Bank and ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Radinal Moochtar&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah. They had good cooperation, I guess, when Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell&#13;
was here.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Oh, yes. Most of all the directors that has been appointed here, yeah,&#13;
we have very close cooperation with all of them.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Was the technical assistance, do you remember that as a very important part of&#13;
what the Bank does, in addition to the funds?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes, because we create a system, yeah? In the past it was more and&#13;
gradually there were systems that has been developed, and that created in borrowing the&#13;
money and so in the past we don't have all these--what we call it--only the grants and so&#13;
from other bilateral countries. Now then we have the starting that we prepared the--how&#13;
do you call it--the projects in a much more systematic way.&#13;
&#13;
But together with that there was a new change from other bilateral support from U.S.&#13;
AID [U.S. Agency for International Development].&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: From U.S. AID. [all speaking, inaudible] So, and they sent people&#13;
from Harvard, also, working together with BAPPENAS [Badan Perencanaan&#13;
Pembangunan Nasional, National Development Planning Board], and they developed a&#13;
new system for the budget, and that new system of the budget is in line with the system&#13;
of the Bank in giving the loans and then creates a--because in the past you are loaned a&#13;
certain ceiling and that's it; that's your budget. And gradually we developed this new&#13;
budget, new system, so together with all those annual sales, but then the programs are&#13;
program-wide and audit-controlled. So in the past ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is for the capital hl;ldget?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The capital budget's on a five-year basis and then an annual basis?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Annual basis. A program basis; now there's a program for every year,&#13;
the programs.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And the Harvard group helped develop that, huh?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes. The Harvard and the Tin bergen [Institute] group from the&#13;
Netherlands.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, really? Tinbergen also did?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: And most of them, they' re working in BAPPENAS. Tomorrow you're&#13;
&#13;
                                Radinal Moochtar&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We're going to meet ..&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: And so the whole picture ofthe background [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see; I see. And these different groups--the Tinbergen, the Harvard, the Bank-&#13;
-they all have--their thinking and advice has been integrated; that is, you haven't been&#13;
getting a lot of different recipes from different people?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Not in the beginning. Later, when it expand, then automatically when it&#13;
expanded, more people are coming in, and more- and each have their own ideas, and&#13;
that makes diversification. And in the Bank is also that they expand their activities, and&#13;
with the Bank of course that creates a little what we call a need for more better&#13;
cooperation between all of us. So it was in the beginning a more closer, smaller in size,&#13;
so it was more easier. But when it expand to cover the whole area, the whole country--in&#13;
the beginning it was not the whole country; it was only the small, the priorities and so,&#13;
but now it' s already covered more or less the whole area up to the remotest areas. But&#13;
there was this diversification, but then, of course, more people are needed. These were&#13;
not in the beginning not there, and they joined the Bank with their new ideas, and then&#13;
our people were also the civil servants {inaudible] and sometimes it's not totally . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What--can you give me an example of what kind of diversification you' re&#13;
speaking about within the Bank? What sorts of differences or conflicts can you . ..&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: Say, in the roads sector. In the beginning the roads, when we developed&#13;
the roads was more on the trunk line. One of our fust projects was the trans-Sumatra&#13;
road, yeah?&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWN MAN: Trans, yeah. [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Trans-Sumatra. That is the trunk line from south to north, but gradually&#13;
when we looked at the, whether it is feasible or unfeasible, there are so many of these--&#13;
what we call it--ideas on whether it should be looked at the regional contacts or it should&#13;
be on the more direct sectoral contact. And so, and when they developed, so one of the&#13;
areas was the--not the conflict, the dispute [inaudible] in Sumatra. And then finally after&#13;
this the ..&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWN MAN: {inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: But there's a place, which is two places where there's this is feasible or&#13;
unfeasible. When you look at only one part, it's not feasible. When you look at the total,&#13;
it seems feasible, yeah. So then we asked the people from other--what do you call it--&#13;
sectors, including also the university from [inaudible] assisting in the regional&#13;
development, and then we include also some of the consultants from the United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Radinal Moochtar&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWN MAN: [inaudible] was in 1960s, ' 70s.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: ' 70s, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
Then finally we end up in a regional development, and then we say that these are the&#13;
possibilities for Bank assistance {inaudible} dispute, whether we look at it only from one&#13;
point of view [inaudible] So actually it moves together with the Bank. The Bank people&#13;
and also our people are looking at the different-what you call it--possibilities,&#13;
alternatives and so, and gradually develop into a more-what we call it--supported&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: As you get all this different kinds of advice from different groups, is there any&#13;
one of them that you look at in the public works area, that you have looked at as your&#13;
particular closest advisor or you just--are they all sort of helping about in the same&#13;
distance and you do the integration yourself?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Not always. Sometimes it's--you have to look it this way, that most of&#13;
us was not yet trained in real- what you call it- systematic plan development. And most&#13;
of us, the sectoral development they know, yeah, how, because we also have the&#13;
assistance like, for instance, from when the war, the world war was ended and we have&#13;
from Japan; yeah- what was the term that's used, they would pay for certain damages&#13;
and so on?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Reparations?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yeah, yeah, and so we have some of the projects as has been like the&#13;
[karakata (phonetic)} dam and we have the {inaudible] dam and we have [inaudible] but&#13;
it was just isolated activities.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: It was already there. So we discuss also with them.&#13;
&#13;
But when we start with the new, with the Harvard and ideas about how to get a&#13;
systematic--what we call it--development program, that was started in 1969 when we had&#13;
the flrst five-year development plan, the second five-year plan. Gradually most of our&#13;
people trying to assist, yeah, the local government and they tried to assist also the&#13;
consultants. The consultants learned from us and we learned from them, so it was a kind&#13;
of a learning process, the first time we could.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Are there any members of that early Harvard group who were particularly, any&#13;
individuals you remember as being particularly important?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: The group, yes, there was both of the groups, Tin bergen and Harvard,&#13;
these are the group of the-what do they call it--Harvard International Institute of&#13;
Development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Radinal Moochtar&#13;
                              November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's right, H-I-I-D. Malcolm Gillis, I guess, would be ...&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes, {inaudible] and also the group also from Tinbergen. So they&#13;
worked together, and they had their office in BAPPENAS and Finance, both BAPPENAS&#13;
and Finance. And that was the beginning. Then everything was more on a--what we call&#13;
it--orderly basis. Before that--just to give you the feeling--everything had been&#13;
[inaudible] You can do whatever you want {inaudible} passing. Now it' s systematic.&#13;
We always said it is--they improved the budget, development of the budget, the Bureau&#13;
of the Budget which consists, of course, of the Finance and BAPPENAS, and that has&#13;
been assisted from the World Bank and assisted from the bilateral assistance. And these&#13;
two was the real engineer of the development assistance, multilateral and bilateral.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did you find that the Bank projects were particularly [inaudible} to advance&#13;
development?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: In the beginning the main thing was we don't have the same wavelength.&#13;
What we need is--there are so many things we need--what they can provide are certain&#13;
things that according to certain rules and regulations. So in the beginning it was not easy&#13;
because the request was tremendous request for assistance, but gradually, and we had&#13;
these priorities, but the priorities are sometimes not compensated. If you go, for instance,&#13;
in [inaudibleJ to. the regional areas, immediately they would like this and this to&#13;
{inaudible} And so while at the Bank, yeah, that may not be the-what we call it--the&#13;
primary objective. The primary obje~tive is- thus it was not, it was not, not--it takes&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you remember an example?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Well, what' s the example that we have--the example of that, I stop&#13;
[inaudible} because I ... Let me ...&#13;
&#13;
For example, in rehabilitation, like project rehabilitation, the Bank is, always looks at the&#13;
whole thing to be as a program on project basis, and we sometimes, we cannot wait--&#13;
everything is based on the rules and regulations of the Bank because it is a bank, yeah? It&#13;
is a little different than the needs that we have to do on right-of-ways, improvement of&#13;
roads, yeah? We would like to do things like that but they say, "Well, that is a need, the&#13;
quality and certain standards and certain" like that was one of the things, for example, on&#13;
roads, the standards of the road had to be. We want more areas to be covered. They want&#13;
certain standards to be kept. So it's in between, yeah, because if we keep with the certain&#13;
standards, then it's only a limited area that we can cover, but if we have a larger area, the&#13;
World Bank say, "In two years it's going to be destroyed." Yeah? So like the network of&#13;
roads which is in need of rehabilitation. So--and then finally we found out the-what do&#13;
you call it--the compromise between what standards that are still possible to be accepted&#13;
by the Bank and what standards that they cannot.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you have problems in that area, along that line, with their requirements that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                R adinal Moochtar&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                8&#13;
&#13;
you use international consultants?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes, yes. Sometimes the people from international standards, they are&#13;
more in the~we call it--they are used to sophisticated areas or not sophisticated at least&#13;
more in developed countries. Now they have to do and work in the developing country&#13;
which, well, standards are not very high and the capacity of the people is not--what we&#13;
call it-advanced enough to accept all the requirements that you have to do this and all&#13;
these things. They still--and the consultants sometimes, the foreign consultants,&#13;
sometimes they aren't used to this. Even, say, in the 1960s it was kind of a joke in saying&#13;
that go to work in the remote areas, first you started with asking about the food, asking&#13;
about the other, the facilities. We don't have at this moment the facilities and so we have&#13;
to--it's not- it's in the quality of the--how do you call it--life.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Lifestyle.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yeah. It's a bit different, and that creates a kind of conflict when they&#13;
have to go back and forth because communication was not developed and the areas are&#13;
remote. So sometimes we have problems with the consultants, yeah, because they have&#13;
to communicate with Jakarta. And in the meantime, yeah, areas like Indonesia which&#13;
consist of so many islands and that's what comm,unication in the beginning was not so&#13;
good, but gradually what this has been improved and of course it's [inaudible] you can&#13;
go, you can have dinner by the [inaudible} But in the beginning it was very difficult.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is true of consultants provided by various donors, the World Bank, AID,&#13;
anything?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: It's not special to the World Bank because if you are used, you get used&#13;
to certain thinking. For instance, you get--if you ask the people whether they can speak&#13;
English in the remote areas, and they say {inaudible] "You cannot. communicate this! "&#13;
because the speaker [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
Well, and the problem is that most of the people can speak English, but in our case it's-&#13;
so it was rather, well, it' s the idea may be the same, but it' s not expressed in the proper&#13;
way and we get sometimes confusion. But that was the beginning, but that was part of&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
In India--! don't know about Thailand; Thailand is a, well--if you look at Malaysia, it's&#13;
much easier because all this time most of the people who went there to the, say, the&#13;
elementary school, already could speak some Thai, but not in Indonesia. That was also&#13;
one of the language barriers, conditions.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Back in the old days, in the colonial days, did you people learn Dutch as a&#13;
second language?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: Actually, those that have been- but it's only a certain percentage that&#13;
used the secondary or the high school include that, impose that in Indonesia. I don't&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
know what for, but all these things {inaudible] But it was so limited, and so you don't&#13;
really get--but that's it, especially {inaudible} speak to the Japanese, you have to learn&#13;
Japanese. So it's just like [inaudible} It was very difficult for--and most of the experts&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Japanese have grown into a bigger role in the last few years, haven't they?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR:         Ye~ ,   yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Bigger aid program and ...&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: Bigger aid program and bigger investment program.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The Japanese, are they collectively more important in trust funds in public&#13;
works now?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: They started.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: They started with that?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Now, they started that now. In the beginning it was more- it was more&#13;
with the World Bank aid. Some of the bilateral was [inaudible] investment but only in&#13;
the last ten {inaudible} when they started more in the {inaudible} in the beginning was&#13;
more public sector because there are other sectors where the [much of this is inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Â· Did the Bank play a coordinating role among the donors interested in public&#13;
works and infrastructure?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: No.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You do your own coordination?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes. That is BAPPENAS does that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: BAPPENAS.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: BAPPENAS, yeah. We request to BAPPENAS, and BAPPENAS they&#13;
have these coordinating meetings of the projects for countries for which we--for us it is&#13;
irrelevant whether it is coming from one country or the other country as long as we get it.&#13;
So and then BAPPENAS coordinates with this group, whether it comes from bilateral&#13;
source or it comes from a multilateral source or it' s ADB {Asian Development Bank] or&#13;
it' s from the Islamic Development Bank or ... We have some projects with the Islamic&#13;
Development Bank {inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In your own area of projects, do you have a preference for World Bank&#13;
fmancing or is it the same?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Radina/ Moochtar&#13;
                                 November 22,1991- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: They have a special uniqueness. World Bank is more free. They are&#13;
not-of course, it's worldwide so they are free in a sense, yeah, as long as you-how do&#13;
you call it-you follow the rules, yeah? You can {inaudible] position of these and these&#13;
countries to be included in the tendering, it's okay, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
But bilateral, it's only in the last years that they are released the tight system here, tight&#13;
aid {inaudible] In the beginning it's all--you can make the assistance, but you have to&#13;
have the technical assistance or the [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank is more in a way more flexible. But nowadays most of the bilateral aid,&#13;
starting [inaudible] are more loose.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Loose?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes, it is getting a bit more loose, except for certain countries like&#13;
Canada, France, yeah, is still rather ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is Japan flexible?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Now it's getting, it' s getting a little more, except as long as you include&#13;
in their projects some of them, whether they win or not, as long as they get . . [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They get their share, I take it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What about other aspects, technical qualities [inaudible] the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: If you look at the EC, from Europe, European Community, in selecting&#13;
the consultants, it's different than with the Bank, the World Bank. From the European&#13;
Community, you just look at this way: those that pass, yeah, if you have a passing grade,&#13;
beyond that anybody who bas the lowest-what do you call it--price in the services ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Ah, I see.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: With the World Bank you have the--what do you call it--the passing&#13;
grade, and the best of them, you have to negotiate with the best. It may be more&#13;
expensive, but it's the best. But the European Community, they say you need only the&#13;
passing grade. Once--anybody who passed that grade . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: In the Bank there's no limit, I mean to the price?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: They have the already allocation. The allocation is there, but then you&#13;
have to negotiate with the best. It's {inaudible] So ifthe average, for instance, the&#13;
passing grade is 80, then for the European Community 80, 81 or 83, and so anyone that&#13;
submitted [inaudible] they do, and then you can open their ..&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWNMAN: Theprice.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: The price acquisition. The lowest you can select, since it's already the&#13;
passing grade so anybody that is passing grade is now qualified.               Â·&#13;
&#13;
VNKNOWN MAN: Is qualified.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Is not disqualified. Not with the World Bank: the World Bank is the&#13;
best. If you have 80 and you have 89, you have to deal with the 89.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Even if it charges twice as much?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Even. They don't open the rest. And so ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: BecauseÂ·it's a pure quality determination?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: And that is sometimes more expensive. But the reason, the reason&#13;
was- there was, there is a reasoning- the reason is, they say, if we don't do that (this is&#13;
what the Bank says) then how about countries which has more higher billing rates. They&#13;
never-then against these people from, say, from Korea, from the ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Taiwan.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Taiwan and so, which is, of course, another aspect. You can--because&#13;
they say ..&#13;
&#13;
                               been parked. You get some contracts with the&#13;
LEWIS: This is the way they've _&#13;
Americans, huh? [Laughter] Or the Brits, huh?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Well, it's the best. {inaudible} some things are more expensive because&#13;
it's {inaudible} to stick with the best. In some, for instance, if you use the Japanese,&#13;
cannot be happy with that because the prices goes up with the Japanese yen, so if we&#13;
select them, for us it's ..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It's more expensive ..&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: It's more expensive.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . with the yen exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yeah, with the exchange rate, yes. It' s a fluctuating exchange rate. But&#13;
since they are the best--what you call it--submission of the proposal, we have to select&#13;
them. Now, what can you say? Cannot we use the other one, is something in which is&#13;
more cheaper?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: If the U.S . is good enough, it's a real bargain now with the dollar down.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Radinal Moochtar&#13;
                           November 22,' 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: But this is something that we cannot change now, yeah? So we look&#13;
only at the quality and-what do you say- technical proposal. Here you have the other&#13;
line.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Who makes this, assigns the grades? You? The Bank?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Oh,jointly, because we make ours, and then the Bank also looks at that,&#13;
a concurrence, a concurrence of the Bank. We have to agree on the, first, on the-what&#13;
you call it--selection and the selection criteria, and then the Bank. And normally we are&#13;
assisted by consultants from the Bank also discussing it with us. Then we sign it also for&#13;
the concurrence of the Bank. So it's open in a way and {inaudible} it's not just that. But&#13;
if they disagree they can say they disagree.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How is the Bank on implementation and monitoring of these projects once you&#13;
let the contracts?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: In many ways since they have here a resident representative much easier&#13;
because ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Because the office is here?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yeah, the office is here in Jakarta, so and we contact them much more&#13;
frequently and we know them and they know us. We cannot say things that they' re--so--&#13;
the same thing, so both of us can control.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: It is easier than, for instance, the ADB has followed this, but followed&#13;
years later in {inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWN MAN: ' 83.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: In '83 this was not seen as the business ofthe resident representative.&#13;
So when the resident representative [inaudible} it's easier. But sometimes it's also&#13;
difficult to--because they know also from other sources, all these things from regions, and&#13;
so we have these--they're more explosive and {inaudible} then, yes, of course you can get&#13;
these things, but in general [inaudible} something, so we call them and they [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And they monitor it fairly closely, do they, the projects, the process?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: In a way, it's not direct there because they have--in the beginning of&#13;
course was rather strict and getting--and now it's more just kind of a follow the, as long&#13;
as we follow the agreed criteria, agreed, then it's no problem.&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWN MAN: [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
                                Radinal Mooch tar&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Well, some here and there, but it is not because of the--sometimes&#13;
because of the certain administration here it's rather slow. For instance, projects that is in&#13;
the remote area in the East, the report has been rather slow in coming. [inaudible]&#13;
islands, for example {inaudible] time and that sometimes makes a kind of the&#13;
information, not sending it, timing [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What about the conditionalities? Is the Bank very interfering, getting more&#13;
involved than other donors in the ...&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: It' s actually like this. It's sometimes not the Bank, but the officers.&#13;
Officers, sometimes they have their own way of doing things that' s not the Bank's rather&#13;
{inaudible] It's not so--if you look at the contract or the loan, something like that,&#13;
sometimes certain things was not taken as it is, and that creates a [inaudible] depending&#13;
on the officers. And the officers are very ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So the manner or the style would be with the work?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: More than other developments?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Because the extent of the loan is more with the World Bank, so the&#13;
impact is bigger.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: One has the impression that the relations between the representative, the office&#13;
here, and the government are on the whole pretty good.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This kind of abrasive action, is that more likely to be somebody coming from&#13;
Washington? No?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: No, no, not always. It depends. Sometimes they recruit also people&#13;
from the area and they have also recruited from the area from Washington, but in many&#13;
cases, even between Washington and the rest of the [inaudible], I'm not in the same line.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Ah.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Because we have two things in the World Bank, and the way we look at&#13;
it, they have their project officers and their procurement officers. The project officers,&#13;
they prepare the projects. Once the project has been done, normally then the procurement&#13;
officers take over. So what has been agreed with the project officers when they&#13;
developed the project, sometimes these people do not understand. It's not because-but&#13;
because they were not involved in it from the beginning. And then sometimes when they&#13;
went away and started a new project, the project has been implemented, and the people&#13;
from the procurement office came and so most of these things that was are not written&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Radinal Moochtar&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
sometimes create a kind of--what do you call it--bad dispute or small dispute and so on.&#13;
But if everything has been written maybe it' s not ...&#13;
&#13;
One program that we faced yesterday, the setback in this case, that when they have&#13;
these-what do they call it--staff appraisal reports at {inaudible} when there is something&#13;
that is a staff appraisal report, from always is it in agreement with our conditions, with&#13;
our, say, findings, because a staff appraisal report is more for them, for the management&#13;
of the Bank, and not for us. And that was the- and sometimes that has been used as a&#13;
basis for the negotiations and for the loan agreement.&#13;
&#13;
So if there' s not a strong delegation who come on the negotiations, sometimes they use&#13;
everything here on the staff appraisal report as something that we agreed, totally agreed.&#13;
Sometimes we do not agree, because the staff appraisal report, yeah, has been sent maybe&#13;
one week before or sometimes during the negotiations, so that--and when the Bank&#13;
normally, they left what they call aide memoires, and the aide memoires are sometimes--&#13;
it' s the findings of the mission, see, not necessarily our own views. So and what we need&#13;
actually is how to improve our capacity, yeah, when the aide memoire has been sent to us&#13;
to reply. And sometimes we do not reply, but we do not agree, and that creates these ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Why don't you reply? .&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: It's the English.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, the English. I see.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: The language.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It's still a problem.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: This is not-:-if you look at all the projects, a very limited people have&#13;
really- they have involvement, but to write something as a reply to express what was not&#13;
in agreement, that is not, not that easy. The language barrier is one of the ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That is interesting. I would have--you must have a lot of younger people in&#13;
ministries who've been trained in English-speaking universities, don't you?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: They can speak.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They can speak. But they can't write, huh? They don't teach them to write!&#13;
[Laughter}&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: And to write something that can express your ideas into something, it's a&#13;
little different than just writing, you know. But this is- it' s not that--because the aide&#13;
memoire has been put in that way very nicely, and so we have to reply to this, and now&#13;
we have to change our ideas into something written that somebody else can understand,&#13;
and that's not--this, if you look at most of us that are now here in the projects and so, are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Radinal Moochtar&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
not good at the administration of these, you know, reply and saying "this is not right" and&#13;
"this should be changed." So that is where the lack of capacity all over Indonesia, not&#13;
only in Public Works and Post Office. And it's very, very unfortunate. It's a small thing,&#13;
but everything under communication. The talking really is easier, yeah? In talking, you&#13;
know, you can ask somebody, but in writing you cannot just ask somebody else, say&#13;
"what was the beginnings of'--and sometimes in the case of the reports, report writing,&#13;
it's not--they must be done, completed, but the report has not been written. And so if the&#13;
report has not been written properly, then we cannot ask for a "no objection" letter or&#13;
changes, and that' s, that' s a handicap for us.&#13;
&#13;
We're handicapped a second one, the handicap is in the legal aspects. In reading all the&#13;
what we call the rules and regulations of the Bank, it's not the same like reading just a&#13;
paperback! [Laughter} I should say so! This is something that, well, if you negotiate&#13;
with the Bank, they always draft when the lawyer is there on the premises and it depends&#13;
on lawyers. So this is thing that-they cannot--so what we need actually in Washington&#13;
is a good lawyer.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, you do have, you retain lawyers?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes, yes. For representation so if we are confronted, but these are the&#13;
big guns, and very expensive guns, too, yeah? [Laughter] What we-for certain things&#13;
we need, to assist us in saying, "Please, please," when we say yes, and so there's no&#13;
reason the-what we call it--the consequences of all saying now this and that and this and&#13;
this and we can borrow. Otherwise, we just say "yes and yes" and we're coming back&#13;
and saying that wasn't what we agreed, we' re not crazy! But having a lawyer join in the&#13;
negotiations is fairly important because sometimes you just ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You need to hire an ex-Bank official.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: It's possible, or even our people who has been trained there, working&#13;
with the Bank and from the embassy and always assisting during the negotiations because&#13;
they all say, "This has been agreed in the past and we agreed to this and this will follow&#13;
like this, and some of the problems that we face in the Bank are this and this and this&#13;
aspect." That's, I mean, a hell of a point because the one that we received sometimes are&#13;
not the one that are implemented. The one that's implemented is sometimes in the local&#13;
areas and so what has been received is on behalf of the ministry, on behalf of a high&#13;
official. And sometimes it' s totally-what do you call it--ready. So these are the small&#13;
things actually, but it's not a big one because the ideas are already approved, but during&#13;
the implementation.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We often hear that the Bank itself is very much preoccupied with negotiation&#13;
and getting the projects committed, getting them designed and committed and the funds&#13;
committed, and less devoted to follow-through, to implementation. I mean, they go on to&#13;
the next project.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: I think it's because the structure of the Bank is like that because the&#13;
&#13;
                                Radinal Moochtar&#13;
                           November 22,1991- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bank structure is- the one that, as I said, the project people are the one that formulates&#13;
the project, and then the procurement are the one that regulates the disbursement of the&#13;
funds. And in between there are people who comes and go and so but these are--what&#13;
you call it--the one. that use the parachutes, using parachute going there and then go away&#13;
again, not the one that stays here.&#13;
&#13;
But the people here with the regional office, they are also limited there in their personnel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWN MAN: Staff&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: Staff, yeah, so that they cannot cover the whole area. But in general&#13;
you see the improvements as they get to know more about the Indonesian situation, they&#13;
get to know more about the conditions that we cannot ask for more because new&#13;
regulations are sometimes--this is also now under the problem. While we develop, we&#13;
produce new regulations. When we started the negotiations, that regulation was not&#13;
available. Now, sometimes that can be a problem! [Laughter] We have to follow the&#13;
new regulations, but they will already have the old regulations which they--and irs not&#13;
that flexible, not that flexible. That sometimes needs more understanding, not we are&#13;
opposed to it totally, but there are some occasions, yeah, that' s--each project there is just&#13;
maybe five years or six years, so between when it was conceived until it was signed, and&#13;
then the agreement was signed and then implemented, that takes at least eight years.&#13;
During that period of time, you know, it's ..&#13;
&#13;
fEnd Tape 1, Side A}&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side Bj&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: .. before, yeah, was three years before they agree that it's going to, but&#13;
when it is implemented, at least five years. And during that period of time the basis was&#13;
when it was conceived.&#13;
&#13;
L E WIS: Yes, there's a big lag.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: A big lag.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The people change.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: The people change, too, and the people in the Bank also change too.&#13;
And so we don't have these, the continuous--so although we try to get them more closer,&#13;
but still it's not that- not that easy.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: To go back a bit, can you think of projects or ideas where the Bank made a big&#13;
contribution, not in the money but [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: There are so many, but which one can we say? It was like growing&#13;
together. So it was rather difficult to say as a special, yeah--it's rather difficult but it was&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
like growing together, and we identify together and developed in such a way, yeah, like&#13;
when we started with the kampung improvement program, and then they developed an&#13;
improved kampong improvement program and then it's going into an integrated urban&#13;
infrastructure development, and S(}--and that is a growing together. And the ideas was&#13;
not--normally it's joint, based on the cooperation between two parties. And so far I do&#13;
not know yet whether it is--you can identify immediately, this is the thrust, yeah?&#13;
&#13;
UNKNWON MAN: This is a vehicle [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What about big mistakes {inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yeah, yeah. There is none that we call it a big mistake from the Bank,&#13;
because they are more careful compared to what we do. Sometimes we make more&#13;
bigger mistakes, yeah, because we are--in the way--it's a little different with the Bank.&#13;
They always have some screens, yeah, before you have the missio.ns here, then another&#13;
one and another. So there are still--where in our case sometimes, yeah, when it's with our&#13;
funds and so we, sometimes we start and then we prefer at least something else there, and&#13;
we say, "That was a mistake." So it's not that--what you call it--a big blunder or&#13;
whatever, something like that. It's ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You-could we sort of go back in time?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You said that the first five-year plan was the projects, public works was more&#13;
rehabilitation. Then the next phase was--you were-so in that case was it more of minor&#13;
irrigation or wells or was it more sort of dams and canals? Was it differences in&#13;
philosophy or ...&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: No, not a difference in philosophy because we already have the irrigated&#13;
areas, quite a number of irrigated areas, and when it was- what we call it--not&#13;
maintained, yeah. So it was not well maintained, and the maintenance was very, very&#13;
small.&#13;
&#13;
LE WIS: I see. Yes, sure.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: So if we look at this way, the maintenance was rather low, and then we&#13;
had to rehabilitate. Then we start with a new project, but still the maintenance funds has&#13;
been low. Only starting, the maintenance has been giyen more stressing; it was in the&#13;
last, I think, the last five years. So there was kind of a--they say, " Maintenance, it' s&#13;
Indonesia," but now maintenance can also be included in the project with assistance of&#13;
the Bank. So that creates a kind of, yeah, if in the past rehabilitation, and then there are&#13;
new projects and so, and now it is a new project and rehabilitation and maintenance after&#13;
20 years. And then we have to be rehabilitated again. And now we have these more,&#13;
better structures. So the new project is included but also rehabilitation is included, yeah,&#13;
but next to that also the operations and maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Radinal Moochtar&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One thing that we still cannot fully adjust with the Bank policy, in this one area where&#13;
we're still looking at, that now gradually it' s more they try to have this, not when you&#13;
have to pay it, repaY.Jllent for the investment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: User charges?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yeah, the user charges, yeah. And this is rather difficult, yeah, because&#13;
in the past we do not have this user charge for irrigation, for instance, and we always said&#13;
it's a good idea but to start that irrigation service fee-we call it that, irrigation service&#13;
fee--to start something new, so we start these new pilot projects and so it's rather gradual,&#13;
and the Bank would like to have a more quicker. But that is sometimes on that the--aU&#13;
the projects that has been developed we should ask for the participation of the public to&#13;
pay more, yeah, to contribute more in the investment repayment and maintenance&#13;
operation. It's not always easy.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's the sort of the policy implication, isn't it?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes, that's a policy.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's become greater in recent years?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yes, now it's getting more greater, yes, and we agree in principle. We&#13;
all agree. It's not that we do not agree, but the way the political system and the&#13;
conditions are not so easy and that sometimes we are not so quick yet, and always we' re&#13;
asked, "When do you start with all these?" We started, but still, what's the system? How&#13;
do we? Because sometimes it' s--they don't own the land, they just working on the land,&#13;
so who is going to pay, yeah? And it's not always the same. In one area it is like that.&#13;
Other areas are different. And the structure in Indonesia is not what you call ..&#13;
&#13;
UNKNOWN MAN: Uniform.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Has that affected also the issues of whether certain public infrastructure as&#13;
roads or ports should be more in the private sector than ..&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: No, no, no. It's like this. The more you expand and the more the things&#13;
are developed, yeah, then we found out that the money is not sufficient. Even if we&#13;
borrow it from all the, from left and right, it's still not sufficient, yeah; one. The second&#13;
is if the participation is not like that and they're waiting in queue, for instance, electricity&#13;
or in the port development or in the water supply development, yeah, so everything is&#13;
being developed by the government on the old system using all these because there is&#13;
what we call public service, then most of the areas that can do it on their own, they have&#13;
to wait because they would like to have a uniform system on equal and the pricing, et&#13;
cetera, but it's up to you whether you are on a demand and supply basis. There's more of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Radinal Mooch.tar&#13;
                             November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a--and this is one area.&#13;
&#13;
The other area is that once you develop an area, for instance, you develop the road, and&#13;
the development of the areas on the left and right of the road which benefit from that, but&#13;
you do not develop it because it's not part of- so it should be the local people or the&#13;
private sector should develop that to enhance more on the use of the road, yeah? So this&#13;
is not--but in the past we only looked at the roads as just a connection between one area&#13;
and another area and not as a part of a development instrument. Now it's being&#13;
developed as--the infrastructure is more as a development instrument, to ask the people,&#13;
the local government as well as the private sector, to develop more projects.&#13;
&#13;
But that means that there are--what we call it--areas where we have to leave it to the&#13;
private sector to develop. In the past, yeah, most of the hospitals- you take hospitals--it&#13;
was always done by the government, yeah. But now we say, "Okay, why not?" Schools:&#13;
most of the schools are the government, but now we say. "Okay, more, you can get&#13;
more," because it's not sufficient, no. We produce how many people? Now every year I&#13;
would say it's two percent. Two percent, it' s really two times Singapore, two times the&#13;
people of Singapore every year. So it's quite a number of people.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Irrigation?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: And irrigation, for example, irrigation, yeah, it's the same, not so much&#13;
that the--because they use the pumps now. They're not waiting. So they say, "Okay, I'm&#13;
using the pumps," so we try to give them technical assistance. They use the pumps and&#13;
irrigate using the pumps. In the past it's always the normal way of irrigation, but now&#13;
you can {inaudible}. They [inaudible] water and they use the pump and they pay about&#13;
20 percent of their harvest for paying the--that's normal! In the past it was unheard of1&#13;
Nobody would think of--they wait for the government to provide the water and at the end&#13;
there that they can use it. But nowadays they don't do it. They say, "Why should I&#13;
wait?" And they- soybeans, and so they plant soybeans and they calculate. They're&#13;
getting more [inaudible] from the government. [Laughter] It's again they're also, so they&#13;
calculate. So in one area in South Sulawesi, for instance, yeah, you have about 200 of&#13;
these small units of these machines of water- what do you call it- the pumping, and&#13;
they just hire it and lease it. And in that sense, yeah, that creates a kind--and we, of&#13;
course, we hope here that we don't have to make all these things, and we provide them&#13;
with the main system, yeah, and then they can take it from there.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is the policy grown out of the government or the Bank is pushing this?&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: It' s actually both, yeah, because when they ask for, please, the private,&#13;
to think more of the private and public participation. Not in this- for example, the Bank&#13;
offers small business credits. Also the Bank offers small business credits and all these,&#13;
and so that's already from the beginning it was part of the understanding between our-&#13;
that we cannot go on our own in the government, in the public sector. There is this small&#13;
business, and some of them even for housing, for instance. The World Bank also&#13;
provides the seed capital to the housing bank, and that also helps develop the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Radinal Mooclttar&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
employment opportunities because this is the employment of the small business also.&#13;
Then that creates, of course, the activity.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, we have also our program for the small business credits and so on, all&#13;
over the country. This is [inaudible] And an industry where the apex loan- I think that's&#13;
what they call it, apex loan- that governs the whole for the industry, small industry&#13;
[inaudible] So there are these--it's a kind of--we cannot just say this is pushed by one of&#13;
the--it's just a growing need, yeah, and recognized by all of us.&#13;
&#13;
But we were too late, rather late. If we had to start it much earlier because in the&#13;
beginning most of us, also from the government, are more oriented for the targets that are&#13;
in the physical [inaudible1 oriented, not so much in the use or the impact of it by the&#13;
government, the benefits, the direct benefits. So most of us are, whether it's a dam or&#13;
with the water irrigation, we just look at the irrigation and the others are looking at the&#13;
creation of the new rice fields and so, but not in one coordinated effort. And now we feel&#13;
that this is not possible, so we have to start with the whole thing like when there is this&#13;
irrigation then we have to have funds for and the people to develop the rice fields, and&#13;
then we have also to have credits for the people to get the seeds, and then also to have to&#13;
work on. All these together, that creates. This is, of course, from different sources.&#13;
&#13;
But that is gradually we feel that it is not possible to have just irrigation or just a separate&#13;
activity or water supply. It's just--see the development of water as we completed but not&#13;
immediately used, so there is only 20, 30 percent and gradual at that period, there's a loss&#13;
in time. That is now we recognize, and we try to improve it.&#13;
&#13;
So, for instance, if the local government and the local water supply enterprise cannot put&#13;
all the housing connections, then we can use also a system of operate and transfer of one&#13;
group and so, and they can connect this and they will pay from their receipts from the&#13;
selling of the water. So that is now we getting more in--in the past they have to wait until&#13;
the government was able to supply them with the [inaudible} This is now being&#13;
[inaudible} It' s better late than nevt?r.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You've been very generous with your time.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: I'm very sorry. It's very difficult. The computer here is not working&#13;
well. [Laughter1&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It has worked very well indeed.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHT AR: But please, yeah, if you need some more information, it's just a small,&#13;
not official, just some handwritten and so, please don't hesitate. You want to have more&#13;
information on thisÂ·and this and this and this, so we' ll try.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's very good of you.&#13;
&#13;
MOOCHTAR: I'll give you my card.&#13;
