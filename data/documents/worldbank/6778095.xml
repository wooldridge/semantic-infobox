Connecting the Slums&#13;
A Utility's Pro-Poor&#13;
Approach in Bangalore&#13;
&#13;
The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board began experimenting with service delivery in slums&#13;
in 2000. Over the next five years, its newly created in-house Social Development Unit mobilized 46 poor&#13;
communities, approximately 10 percent of the city's slums, of which more than half have successfully&#13;
connected to the BWSSB network and continue to be served with water, receive bills, and make payments.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
BWSSB managed to significantly increase access for the poor to piped&#13;
water supply while committing to good management and cost recovery.&#13;
Its slum program is slowly but surely being scaled up and provides an&#13;
important model for pro-poor utility reform in other cities.&#13;

household connections were rare in&#13;

the slums, as BWSSB's policy stated&#13;
&#13;
that a connection would not be&#13;
&#13;
approved unless the resident could&#13;
&#13;
provide proof of tenure. Most slum&#13;
&#13;
dwellers were unable to do this, either&#13;
&#13;
because they did not have legal land&#13;
&#13;
tenure, or else had no paperwork to&#13;
&#13;
prove it. (For example, only 53 of all the&#13;
&#13;
slums in the city had formal tenure and&#13;
&#13;
very few residents of these slums&#13;

actually paid any property tax.)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     Greater Metropolitan Bangalore: Comprises the Bangalore City Municipal Corporation plus seven adjoining&#13;
     municipalities, one town municipal council, and parts of neighboring district areas; 2001 population 6.5 million;&#13;
     nearly 500 documented slums housing over one million people.&#13;
&#13;
     Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP): The Municipal Corporation of Bangalore; strongly aligned with the state&#13;
     government (despite the recent 74th amendment to the Indian Constitution advocating decentralization); in charge of&#13;
     storm water drains, solid waste management, street lighting, and public foot paths; does not have a dedicated slum&#13;
     division so slum work is carried out by ward-level engineers alongside other routine works; 2001 population 4.3 million,&#13;
     including approximately 400 slums.&#13;
&#13;
     Bangalore Development Authority (BDA): Responsible for the preparation of city development plans, approval&#13;
     of building and housing plans, land acquisition, development and subdivision of agricultural land, provision of municipal&#13;
     services in newly developed land, including pockets of slums; after works are complete newly developed areas are&#13;
     handed over to the BMP; approximately 20 percent of city slums are on land owned by BDA; in some cases BDA&#13;
     regularizes slums under its jurisdiction and issues land tenure documents.&#13;
&#13;
     Karnataka Slum Clearance Board (KSCB): Nodal agency for slum improvement for the state of Karnataka;&#13;
     authorized to execute improvement works, demolish buildings, clear an entire slum or acquire the land a slum is situated&#13;
     on, and provide some security to slum dwellers; less than 4 percent of slums are on KSCB land.&#13;
&#13;
     Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB): Parastatal water and sewerage utility, no&#13;
     obligation to supply water to slums, but directed by its governing Act to provide `gratuitous water supply through public&#13;
     hydrants or other conveniences...subject to payment by the Corporation'.&#13;

                                                                                                      1AusAidMasterPlan,BaselineSocio-EconomicSurveyReport,Aug2001.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
  Public taps have never provided a particularly good level of service: there are&#13;
  up to 50 households per tap, water supply is for short periods on alternate&#13;
  days, and long queues are common.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Box 2: The process of slum `declaration'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Slums in Bangalore are often classified in terms of their status in the process of `declaration', a lengthy and byzantine&#13;
       mechanism to formalize the status of slums and make them eligible for development. Declared slums are entitled to land&#13;
       rights and certain benefits, including infrastructure services, so declared slum status is coveted by slum dwellers.&#13;
&#13;
       The first step in the process is for a slum to be `identified', which means that it is merely known to exist by the KSCB.&#13;
       A `notification' is then issued for the slum (for this reason declared slums are also sometimes referred to as notified&#13;
       slums), allowing anyone with a claim to the land to come forward. The status of the slum in the declaration process is&#13;
       related to the section of the Karnataka Slum Areas Improvement and Clearance Act that it falls under; and whether it is&#13;
       `preliminary' (P) or `final' (F). Most slums start out under the general section 3 of the Act, and are thus categorized as 3P.&#13;
       Slums on land deemed to be unsuitable for habitation may be notified under section 11 of the Act, which allows for them&#13;
       to be relocated (`cleared'), or section 17, through which the land they are on is acquired by the KSCB itself. Thus an 11F&#13;
       slum has been relocated, and a 17F slum is on land fully under the control of the KSCB.&#13;
&#13;
       Slum residents may be issued with what are called `possession certificates', and land in slums is often informally bought&#13;
       and sold. However, there is controversy over the extent of official land title even fully-declared 17F slum dwellers actually&#13;
       have. In a few cases, BDA has issued slum dwellers with `lease-cum-ownership' papers that provide full tenure after a&#13;
       10-year lease period during which the recipient pays a regular nominal lease payment.&#13;
&#13;
       The completion of the declaration process can take years, if not decades. It is not a good indicator of the level of&#13;
       infrastructure and housing in a given slum; usually the process lags far behind the development of a slum. Moreover, there&#13;
       are cases in which undeclared slums have actually received more attention than declared ones because political influence&#13;
       was exerted in their favor.&#13;
&#13;
       In 2004, KSCB had 367 slums in its records, of which 209 had been declared. Estimates show that there are just under&#13;
       600,000 people in the 367 officially-recorded slums, but there are slums in the city which are not in KSCB records at all.&#13;
       These remain marginalized in terms of official provision of network services other than what they can obtain through&#13;
       political patronage or the intermediation of NGOs.&#13;

     Box 3: Connection cost and tariff adjustments to make water affordable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Connection Costs&#13;
     Normal rate for a new domestic connection: Rs 1,800.&#13;
     In slums&#13;
     For plots less than 150 square feet only the water meter cost is covered: Rs 550.&#13;
     For plots between 150 and 600 square feet a sanitary charge is added: Rs 800.&#13;
     If slum dwellers coordinate and have their additional piping and taps installed by the same plumber the additional cost per&#13;
     household is between Rs 800 and 1,000.&#13;
     Tariffs&#13;
     The old tariff structure required all customers to pay a minimum charge equivalent to 15 m3 of water a month. Most slum&#13;
     dwellers consumed around half this amount, so essentially paid for water they did not use. The new tariff reduced the&#13;
     minimum charge to 8 m3. A family using this amount or less now pays Rs 73 per month, compared with Rs 115 under the&#13;
     old structure. For shared connections, the total volume consumed is divided by the number of families sharing a tap, after&#13;
     which the same tariff structure is applied to the amount consumed by each family.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     9&#13;

  A low risk approach, allowing BWSSB to `try its hand' in slums, was crucial&#13;
  to ensuring that the program got off the ground. Rigid performance targets&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Box 4: The process of connecting slums&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Selection of slums is based on good relationships with NGOs forged during the pilots and subsequent post-pilot&#13;
     operations, as well as on genuine need, client demands, engineer requests, state of network extension, and water&#13;
     availability. The SDU ensures that the local distribution network is either already in place through the Package Program or&#13;
     feasible through minor extension works from nearby mains.&#13;
     Initial forays into communities consist of a preliminary assessment of the existing water and sanitation situation,&#13;
     meetings with local leaders and community groups, and door-to-door house visits. During these visits, the BWSSB slum&#13;
     program is explained, information on service levels (individual connections, private connections) and costs is&#13;
     disseminated, and willingness to connect to the network is assessed.&#13;
     Site visits with the engineers from BWSSB's local service station are carried out in order to bring engineers on board,&#13;
     introduce them to the community, and discuss technical issues flagged during the initial visits. These visits also&#13;
     demonstrate to slum dwellers the visible presence and commitment of engineers.&#13;
     Application forms are distributed, either directly to residents or community leaders, or through the NGO who will&#13;
     monitor and assist in compiling and collecting them. Applications are submitted for approval, with proof of occupancy&#13;
     and the connection fee, in batches of about 50 at a time.&#13;
     Meters are issued and slums connected to the network after at least 50 percent of the slum has paid. The time lag&#13;
     between the submission of applications and the issuing of meters can be lengthy, as this step is often delayed if water is&#13;
     not available or the distribution network is not yet ready.&#13;
     Distribution of water and billing commences as soon as meters are issued. Water is usually supplied on alternate days&#13;
     for two to six hours at a time. Monthly billing is carried out by meter readers and cash payments are collected at the&#13;
     service station.&#13;

     Each NGO brought its own philosophy and style to the program, and the quality of their work had a strong impact on&#13;
     outcomes. They did not work closely together or form a united policy front, and the greatest hurdle was convincing some&#13;
     NGOs that charging slum dwellers for reliable network water was beneficial. Some NGOs, in particular KKNSS which&#13;
     lobbies for slum dwellers' rights and organizes communities throughout the state, were wary of the approaches used by&#13;
     BWSSB in slums. In May 2003, KKNSS organized a demonstration outside the BWSSB premises to protest the closure&#13;
     of public taps and to advocate for free water for slums. In contrast, AVAS campaigned directly and personally with the&#13;
     SDU and the Chairman of BWSSB to ensure network extension in their slums and to lobby for a rationalized tariff that&#13;
     made water affordable for slum dwellers.&#13;

     Box 6: The impact of revenue targets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The most successful service station in the slum program, Machalibetta in the East Division, has connected 12 slums to&#13;
     the network and is in the process of mobilizing another two. Over three years, the engineer in charge added about 2,500&#13;
     connections from the slums, which represents 32 percent of his total customer base of 7,730 domestic connections.&#13;
     Approximately 5 percent of his total domestic revenue collection comes from this new slum customer segment. This&#13;
     figure is likely to range between 2 and 15 percent for an average service station. Although a high proportion of revenue in&#13;
     Machalibetta comes from high-tariff non-domestic and industrial connections, the engineer has still used slums to meet&#13;
     and surpass his monthly targets, achieving a collection efficiency relative to a target of 106 percent.&#13;

record was one of large-scale&#13;
indifference to slums. And although&#13;
external factors triggered a change&#13;
in policy and approach by senior&#13;
management, this new attention&#13;
to the urban poor was not&#13;
communicated to frontline engineers&#13;
in any explicit way. They were merely&#13;
informed that they could now, in theory,&#13;
connect slums to the network through&#13;
individual connections.&#13;
&#13;
In practice, engineers responded&#13;
to the SDU according to a set of&#13;
indirect incentives and disincentives,&#13;
which did not apply equally to the&#13;
entire organization.&#13;
&#13;
First, slums provided an untapped&#13;
market for engineers when they needed&#13;
to increase revenue. Around the same&#13;
time that the SDU was rolling out the&#13;
slum program, senior management&#13;
started increasing monthly revenue&#13;
targets for service stations and&#13;
demanded they be met either by&#13;

            Connecting the slums: a utility's
            pro-poor approach in Bangalore
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Over a five-year period from 2000 to
            2005, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB)
            experimented with service delivery in slums, first through
            three pilot projects under a donor-funded program, and then
            through a newly created Social Development Unit (SDU). By
            early 2005, the SDU had mobilized 46 poor communities,
            approximately 10 percent of the city's slums, of which
            more than half had successfully connected to the BWSSB
            network and continue to be served with water, receive bills,
            and make payments.
