ï»¿ANNEX I OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Program description&#13;
1.    Rationale and Scope of the Programmatic Trust Fund&#13;
The Commission and the World Bank share a common vision of building competitive and&#13;
sustainable economies and in reducing poverty and social exclusion - goals of the Europe&#13;
2020 Agenda which is built on three pillars of smart, green and inclusive growth. To date, the&#13;
cooperation between the Commission and the World Bank has been largely indirect, with the&#13;
World Bank engaging directly with individual European countries on projects that are&#13;
financed by the governments in whole or in part by EU-origin resources, such as the&#13;
Structural Funds, the Rural Development Fund or the Instrument for Pre-Accession&#13;
Assistance (IPA). This experience has deepened the mutual appreciation for the&#13;
complementary competencies of each institution.&#13;
The Commission and the World Bank agree that more direct interaction would be beneficial&#13;
to both institutions and through them to the countries. This applies particularly to the&#13;
provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge services and technical assistance. The&#13;
Commission has already demonstrated its interest analytical projects to be carried out by the&#13;
Bank. The Commission has also expressed an interest in ensuring that the World Bank&#13;
provides technical assistance to develop detailed "profiles" or "portraits" of individuals with&#13;
no or limited labor-market attachment and identify distinct groups of individuals who are the&#13;
potential clients of income support and employment support policies with the objective of&#13;
contributing to the decrease of the population that is at risk of poverty or social exclusion by&#13;
strengthening the empirical basis for analyzing active inclusion. There is good reason to&#13;
anticipate that the EC and the World Bank will continue to collaborate on a number of themes&#13;
under all three pillars of the Europe 2020 Agenda during the remaining years of its&#13;
implementation. This Programmatic Trust Fund is set up with the express purpose of allowing&#13;
the European Commission to avail itself of the World Bank's analytical and policy capacity in&#13;
fulfilling the goals of Europe 2020.&#13;
1                                      .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX L.A OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Description of the Project Activities to the carried out under the Program and the&#13;
Additional Contribution&#13;
In the framework and in line with the Program and Europe Agenda 2020, the objective of the&#13;
Project Activities is to develop detailed "profiles" or "portraits" of individuals with no or&#13;
limited labor-market attachment and identify distinct groups of individuals who are the&#13;
potential clients of income support and employment support policies with the objective of&#13;
contributing to the decrease of the population that is at risk of poverty or social exclusion by&#13;
strengthening the empirical basis for analyzing active inclusion.&#13;
Except as the Commission and the IBRD may otherwise agree, the IBRD shall perform the&#13;
following activities, subject to such modifications and refinements thereof as the Commission&#13;
and the IBRD may agree upon from time to time to achieve the objective thereof:&#13;
1.    Component:&#13;
This component supports the carrying out of analytical review to establish a country-specific&#13;
"profile" of working-age individuals who experience limited labor market attachment (either&#13;
not working or marginally employed for more than half of the data years) on the basis of the&#13;
latest available EU-SILC data and any other data source to be agreed between the&#13;
Commission and the IBRD.&#13;
To this effect and subject to data availability, the following countries are expected to be&#13;
reviewed during an initial 9-month period: Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania and&#13;
Romania. The Commission and IBRD may agree on prioritizing other countries as the need&#13;
arises, and subject to data availability.&#13;
To the extent possible and if necessary, the Commission will facilitate data access, by helping&#13;
IBRD initiate contacts with national data collection agencies or with Eurostat as the case my&#13;
be.&#13;
2.    Required outputs:&#13;
The World Bank shall provide the following output in the timeframe indicated&#13;
The main output will be a breakdown of identifiable distinct groups of individuals who are&#13;
characterized by persistent labor market detachment. For each group, the following would be&#13;
reported:&#13;
* Group size&#13;
* A detailed characterization of each group in terms of the type of labor market&#13;
detachment, distinguishing between (a) not working at all, (b) 'marginal' employment&#13;
(working fewer than X months a year), and (c) low-wage employment (earnings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿during the year as a whole are below a given threshold). Data permitting, a fourth&#13;
category would be (d) informal work.'&#13;
*   A detailed characterization of each group in terms of relevant family and individual&#13;
characteristics, including age, gender, education, as well as labor-market situation&#13;
(e.g., job-search intensity).&#13;
*   Indicators of the statistical risk of experiencing labor market detachment within each&#13;
group, summarized in an appropriately intuitive way (e.g., the share of individuals in&#13;
each group facing a "high" or "low" risk of labor market detachment).&#13;
*   A set of 'headline' social inclusion indicators, including the share of people in each&#13;
group with income below the "at-risk-of-poverty" threshold, and the share of people&#13;
with "high" or "low" scores of relevant material deprivation measures.&#13;
*   Information on the benefit recipiency status of group members (e.g., the share of&#13;
people who are in receipt of unemployment benefits or who receive other types of&#13;
income support as a result of their employment status or low income level).&#13;
Results will be presented using summary graphs and tables, accompanied by comprehensive&#13;
results showing the full set of characteristics for each group. For each country, a short 2-3&#13;
page write-up would summarize the results in an agreed-upon format between the&#13;
Commission and the IBRD.&#13;
informal work is difficult to observe directly. Individuals may be classified as working informally if they are unpaid family workers, receive&#13;
the majority of their earnings in kind, or do not pay social security contributions on earnings that would be subject to contributions. SILC&#13;
data do not include information on social contribution payments in all countries. Identifying informal work may not be possible in these&#13;
cases.&#13;
