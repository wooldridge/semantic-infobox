this Administration Arrangement and will not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to&#13;
the Donor, including, without limitation, any duties or commitments that might otherwise apply&#13;

and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including its procurement,&#13;
financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and&#13;

the Bank nor the Donor will bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4   The Contribution may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as may&#13;

discretion, request a change to the provisions of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which&#13;
