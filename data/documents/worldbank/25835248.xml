        Key POINTS&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Global momentum around emerging evidence of the linkages between water,&#13;
            sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and undernutrition, and high-level policy&#13;
            dialogue advocating for nutrition-sensitive WASH, has created a â&#128;&#156;window&#13;
            of opportunityâ&#128;&#157; to influence how the World Bank Group approaches lending&#13;
            for WASH projects, and how policies are designed for greater impact on&#13;
            nutrition.&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Achieving nearly universal coverage of the most effective nutrition interventions&#13;
            in high burden countries would only reduce stunting by 20Â percent globally,&#13;
            suggesting a critical role for nutrition-sensitive interventions such as WASH&#13;
            to address the remaining burden.&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Increased use of geographic and demographic targeting of WASH projects&#13;
            can help reach populations where water and sanitation coverage is low and&#13;
            undernutrition is high.&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Incorporating state-of-the-art behavior change methods and insights from&#13;
            behavioral economics into World Bank Group operations in the WASH&#13;
            sector, and documenting behavioral outcomes, can provide plausible&#13;
            evidence of impact on nutrition.&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Institutional levers can be used to align incentives of task teams and&#13;
            senior management toward multisectoral approaches, while results-based&#13;
            incentives can align objectives at the project level.&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 WASH interventions can increase nutritional impact by measuring and&#13;
            monitoring outcomes beyond access to services, such as usage,&#13;
            maintenance of infrastructure, and behavioral change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Undernutrition is estimated to cause 45 percent of all child deaths (Black&#13;
et al. 2013), and is responsible for 11 percent of the global disease burden (Black&#13;
et al. 2008). It results in productivity losses1 to individuals estimated at more&#13;
than 10Â percent of lifetime earnings, and gross domestic product (GDP) losses as&#13;
high as 2 to 3 percent. Reducing undernutrition is at the core of the World Bank&#13;
GroupÂ (WBG) mission to end poverty. However, nutrition interventions are not&#13;
sufficient to tackle the problem of undernutrition: even at 90 percent coverage&#13;
the core set of proven nutrition interventions in high nutrition burden countries&#13;
would only decrease stunting by 20 percent globally.&#13;

&#13;
    Inadequate dietary intake and disease are directly                                Multisectoral Approaches (Alderman et al. 2013). The report&#13;
    responsible for undernutrition, but there are multiple                            provided the intellectual and theoretical rationale for a&#13;
    indirect determinants that exacerbate these direct causes,                        multisectoral response to malnutrition and presented a&#13;
    including food insecurity, inadequate childcare practices,                        series of self-contained guidance notes for task team leaders&#13;
    low maternal education, poor access to health services, lack                      (TTLs), World Bank Group staff, development partners,&#13;
    of access to clean water and sanitation, and poor hygiene                         and community implementers responsible for the design&#13;
    practices. Political, cultural, social, and economic factors                      and oversight of projects and programs in agriculture, social&#13;
    likewise play a role. Given the range of drivers of nutritionâ&#128;&#148;                    protection, and health. The overall aim of the report was&#13;
    spanning multiple sectors of agriculture, social protection,                      to mainstream nutrition activities into multisectoral action&#13;
    health, WASH, and educationâ&#128;&#148;tackling undernutrition                               (Alderman et al. 2013).&#13;
    demands a multisectoral response.&#13;
                                                                                      Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) was recognized&#13;
    Children who are stunted (having low height-for-age) suffer                       in the report as a key sector for maximizing nutritional&#13;
    from a long-term failure to grow, reflecting the cumulative                       impact, but was not covered in depth as part of the self-&#13;
    effects of chronic deficits in food intake, poor care practices,                  contained guidance notes originally produced. Emerging&#13;
    and illness. Wasting, defined as low weight-for-height, is the                    evidence in the WASH sector suggests the linkages between&#13;
    result of recent shocks to lack of calories and nutrients from                    WASH and nutrition may be stronger than previously&#13;
    famine, or a severe and sudden illness. Underweight (low                          understood. This has generated a great deal of momentum&#13;
    weight-for-age) serves as a composite measure that captures                       in both the WASH and nutrition sectors about how the&#13;
    both stunting and wasting. Globally, the prevalence of                            two can work more closely to achieve better outcomes.&#13;
    stunting, wasting, and underweight among children under                           This paper addresses this objective from both the WASH&#13;
    five years of age in 2011 was 26 percent, 8 percent, and                          perspective, on how nutrition-specific programs (as well&#13;
    16 percent, respectively (UNICEF, WHO, World Bank                                 as nutrition-sensitive social protection, livelihoods, and&#13;
    2012). Undernutrition is associated with severe long-term                         community-driven development programs) can provide an&#13;
    consequences such as poor cognitive development, lower                            alternative platform to deliver services at scale and more&#13;

&amp;#12;    II.             Objective and Background&#13;
&#13;
    The objective of this paper is to support task teams              The solution is not as straightforward as including nutrition&#13;
    and senior management to integrate WASH into                      in project development objectives (PDOs), for which task&#13;
    nutrition-specific programs (as well as nutrition-sensitive       teams would be held accountable. Instead, guidance is&#13;
    social protection, livelihoods, and community-driven              needed on how to incorporate nutritional considerations&#13;
    development programs), and to make WASH interventions             into WASH projects, while at the same time avoiding&#13;
    more nutrition-sensitive, and thus more impactful on              unnecessary complexities, to ensure that the contribution&#13;
    nutrition in the following ways:                                  of WASH interventions to reducing undernutrition is&#13;
                                                                      accounted for.&#13;
       1.	 Enhance the design of policy and lending operations&#13;
           in the WASH sector to maximize the impact on               Why Is WASH Important for Nutrition?&#13;
           nutrition outcomes for the poor                            Undernutrition is both a major cause and an effect in&#13;
       2.	 Provide guidance on effective ways to integrate            the cycle of poverty triggered by inadequate WASH.&#13;
           WASH with nutrition-specific and other nutrition-          Through the various theoretical pathways described below,&#13;
           sensitive intervention&#13;
       3.	 Measure the potential impact of activities on&#13;
           nutrition through meaningful outcome indicators,&#13;
           such as infrastructure quality, usage (behavior), and&#13;
           maintenance&#13;
&#13;
    The role of WASH, in particular, in improving nutritional&#13;
    outcomes has received greater attention in recent years. The&#13;
    attention has centered on a hypothesis that environmental&#13;
    enteropathy may be a key cause of chronic child&#13;
    undernutrition, and the primary pathway linking poor&#13;
    WASH to poor nutrition outcomes, rather than through&#13;
    diarrhea. A burgeoning body of evidence is finding strong&#13;
    linkages between poor sanitation, and open defecation in&#13;
    particular, and stunting. Finally, the strong association&#13;
    between income poverty, child stunting, and lack of access&#13;
    to water supply and sanitation highlights the critical need&#13;
    for interventions that will benefit this target group and&#13;
    increase prosperity among the bottom 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
    Despite global momentum around this emerging evidence&#13;
    and high-level policy dialogue advocating for nutrition-&#13;
    sensitive WASH, practical guidelines on how to work cross-&#13;
    sectorally are currently lacking. This is particularly the case&#13;
    for WBG lending operations, which focus to a large extent&#13;
    on infrastructure investments, rather than the â&#128;&#156;softerâ&#128;&#157; side&#13;
    of WASH, which includes behavioral change. To achieve&#13;
    greater impact, approaches to integration need to go beyond&#13;

undernutrition primarily by reducing infection and                                improving income does not guarantee improved nutrition&#13;

access may influence nutrition outcomes by increasing the                         nutrition. In other words, poverty reduction goals cannot&#13;

    Inadequate WASH can impact child nutritional status                        that 58 percent of annual deaths caused by diarrhea are&#13;
    through multiple pathways. These pathways and the                          attributable to poor WASH conditions (PrÃ¼ss-Ã&#156;stun et al.&#13;
    strength of each, based on current evidence, are illustrated               2014).&#13;

IV.                         World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Water Program&#13;
&#13;
Although WASH interventions supported by World Bank&#13;
Group projects may contribute to improved health and&#13;
nutrition outcomes, nutritional outcomes are perceived&#13;
as too far down the causal chain to be adopted as project&#13;
development objectives.&#13;
&#13;
The 1993 Water Resources Management Strategy was the first&#13;
in the World Bank Group to recognize the health benefits of&#13;
water supply and sanitation (World Bank 1993). In 2004, the&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Board developed a sector&#13;
program to guide WBG lending and nonlending technical&#13;
assistance, which recognized improving health outcomes as&#13;
one of five cross-cutting operational, policy, and institutional&#13;
priorities requiring investment in WASH infrastructure as well&#13;
as behavioral change and a focus on the poor as an institutional&#13;
priority (World Bank 2004). The program adopted a three-&#13;
pronged strategy to realize health benefits of improved WASH:&#13;
(i) access to sufficient quantities of water, (ii) sanitary disposal&#13;
of excreta, and (iii) sound hygiene practices.&#13;
&#13;
Over the past decade, a handful of water supply, sanitation,&#13;
and hygiene projects supported by the World Bank Group&#13;
have explicitly targeted nutrition. A portfolio review&#13;
conducted for this paper examined whether and how WBG&#13;
water supply, sanitation, and hygiene projects incorporate&#13;
health and nutrition objectives, activities, and outcomes.&#13;
The review included all water supply (WC), sanitation&#13;
(WA), and general water and sanitation (WZ) approved                                            This new latrine was built by a local sanitation entrepreneur&#13;
projects from fiscal year 2005 through 2014 (n = 274) with                                      in Bangladesh, who was supported by WSP using sanitation&#13;
health (JA) and/or social services (JB) sector coding. A total                                  marketing. Photo: Mirva Tuulia Moilanen / World Bank&#13;
of 14 projects meeting these criteria were reviewed.&#13;
                                                                                                The majority of the projects with cross-sector coding&#13;
Of the reviewed projects, five referenced health and/or                                         and considered by the review as â&#128;&#156;multisectoralâ&#128;&#157; were&#13;
nutrition objectives in the project development objective                                       identified as such because they included hygiene&#13;
(PDO)2 and only one project included nutrition-specific                                         education and/or hygiene behavior change interventions&#13;
activities.3 In terms of measured outcomes, one project                                         (12 projects/86Â  percent), specifically handwashing with&#13;
measured a nutrition-specific outcome and three measured                                        soap, which is classified as a nutrition intervention by the&#13;
health outcomes such as diarrhea incidence and incidence                                        nutrition sector. Only four of these projects included a&#13;

     Keywords included quality of life, health-specific terms, livelihood, human development, improved health-related behaviors, hygiene living conditions, nutrition-specific terms,&#13;
     basic services, and poverty reduction.&#13;
3	&#13;
     Nutrition-specific activities were defined to include infant and young child feeding practices, prenatal/maternal nutrition, micronutrient supplementation, child growth&#13;
     monitoring, and nutrition and food hygiene education interventions, as well as nutrition components of early childhood development programs, nutrition components of social&#13;
     safety nets, home gardens and small livestock production, and targeted emergency food aid.&#13;

VI.                 Challenges to Multisectoral Approaches&#13;
                    in the WASH Sector&#13;
The challenges of working multisectorally are well              There is increasing attention in the research community to&#13;
recognized and are not unique to the WASH sector. Lack of       study and isolate the effects of WASH on nutrition, but&#13;
incentives, institutional barriers, weak client demand and      until this evidence is available, projects face risks proposing&#13;
donor funding, risk aversion, and insufficient knowledge        approaches that are not backed by strong evidence.&#13;
of best practices are all limiting factors. The following&#13;
are some of the key challenges and how they specifically        Inherent complexity of WASH projects. Water projects&#13;
influence multisectoral approaches in the WASH sector.          have one of the lowest disbursement rates of the infrastructure&#13;
                                                                global practices. A high number of â&#128;&#156;problem projectsâ&#128;&#157; (that&#13;
Lack of evidence to enable prioritization of WASH               is, projects facing procurement delays, slow disbursement,&#13;
interventions. There is still limited knowledge as to           and financial management issues) is indicative of the&#13;
which WASH interventions and in what combinations               technical complexity of water projects. Project TTLs trying&#13;
are most effective for reducing fecal contamination of the      to meet tight deadlines for project preparation and who are&#13;
environment. In order to integrate WASH components              accountable for delivery of the portfolio are understandably&#13;
beyond handwashing with soap, the nutrition sector              reluctant to introduce project components that may get&#13;
needs evidence on where to focus its efforts. Similarly, the    derailed during project appraisal.&#13;
research community is still building the evidence base on&#13;
which WASH interventions are most strongly linked with          Institutional complexity is likewise a challenge. Water and&#13;
nutrition.                                                      sanitation are often handled by different line ministries&#13;
                                                                in client countries, which can add further complexity to&#13;
Some key WASH interventions hypothesized to impact              already demanding timeframes and technically challenging&#13;
nutrition, such as basic sanitation and improved water          projects. At the same time, in some countries, sanitation&#13;
supply, have not been subject to the level of rigorous study    and hygiene are under the authority of Ministry of Health,&#13;
needed to generate evidence that could be used to advocate      which opens avenues for closer integration between WASH&#13;
for nutrition-sensitive approaches. This level of evidence is   and nutrition-specific projects.&#13;
generally available through the gold standard in scientific&#13;
research, randomized controlled trials. However, in a recent    Focus on infrastructure lending. The vast majority of&#13;
Cochrane review of the impact of WASH interventions on          World Bank Group loans in the WASH sector target large&#13;
nutrition outcomes, neither sanitation nor water supply         infrastructure: sewerage networks, wastewater treatment&#13;
improvements were included due to lack of experimental          plants, and water supply systems. Infrastructure lending&#13;
evidence on the effects.                                        results in large loans with easily quantifiable outcomes. On-&#13;
                                                                site sanitation and fecal sludge removal are seldom financed.&#13;
Similarly, there is limited evidence of the costs and cost-     On the other hand, there is little lending for the â&#128;&#156;softerâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive WASH interventions         side of WASH, specifically communication, education, and&#13;
compared with a business as usual approach. There could         behavior change, which are required in order for WASH&#13;

of WASH investments brings greater returns, as measured&#13;
by health and nutrition outcomes. Similarly, leveraging&#13;
delivery channels could lead to cost savings, resulting in&#13;
more cost-effective programs.&#13;

     VII.                    Opportunities for Nutrition-Sensitive WASH&#13;
&#13;
     Despite these challenges, an emerging interest in and           SDGs on eliminating open defecation shifts the focus from&#13;
     attention to the role of WASH, and sanitation in particular,    infrastructure to behavior change, conferring more plausible&#13;
     on nutritional outcomes has provided a â&#128;&#156;window of               nutritional benefits of WASH. The SDGs will again call&#13;
     opportunityâ&#128;&#157; to influence how the World Bank Group              attention to the nonincome face of poverty with a nutrition&#13;
     approaches lending for WASH projects, and how policies          indicator on stunting. Investments in improved WASH can&#13;
     are designed for greater impact on nutrition. Some reasons      contribute to reducing both income and nonincome poverty.&#13;
     for this are:&#13;
                                                                     WBG reform and the twin goals. Eliminating extreme poverty&#13;
     Environmental enteropathy hypothesis. Attention has             and increasing shared prosperity will require eliminating&#13;
     recently focused on the role of environmental enteropathy       nutritional deficiencies, which demands input from multiple&#13;
     (or enteric infection more broadly) on poor child nutritional   sectors. The twin goals motivate a shift in thinking toward&#13;
     outcomes. Research has only just begun to try to understand     the bottom 40 percent, who are most likely to lack access&#13;
     the contribution that poor WASH has on environmental            to WASH services and be undernourished. Targeting will&#13;
     enteropathy, which could prove to be a major link between       become more important as the WBG works toward reducing&#13;
     WASH and child nutrition.                                       extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Secondly,&#13;
                                                                     the new Global Practice structure, in particular the positions&#13;
     Sustainable Development Goals. With the recognition             of program leader and global solutions group lead, could prove&#13;
     that progress on the sanitation MDG was not as fast as that     to be a unique facility to (i) identify cross-sectoral solutions&#13;
     on water supply, sanitation is being prioritized in the post-   and (ii) provide an enabling environment for multiple sectors&#13;
     2015 development dialogue. The emphasis of the expected         to work toward the same goal.&#13;

VIII.                          Principles for Nutrition-Sensitive WASH&#13;
                               InvestmentsÂ andÂ Policies&#13;
WASH investments and policies that incorporate nutrition-        and Nutrition projects conducted between fiscal years&#13;
sensitive goals explicitly into design and implementation can    2005 and 2014 were most frequently undertaken in low-&#13;
increase nutritional impact. Although access to WASH services    income countries with the dual burden of undernutrition&#13;
has been the primary focus of the WASH sector in the MDG         and poor access to WASH, indicating appropriate targeting&#13;
era, issues around equity, usage, and maintenance of services    is happening at a macro level. Eighty percent of these&#13;
are becoming increasingly important. An emerging toolkit of      projects indicate a target beneficiary group such as the poor&#13;
evidence-based guidance, instruments, and incentives provides    and women and children. However, project documents&#13;
tremendous opportunity to capitalize on the unique synergies     seldom contain information on how target beneficiaries are&#13;
between WASH and nutrition to increase the development           identified, increasing the likelihood that target groups may&#13;

The following are four key principles for action:&#13;
                                                                 Taking It Further&#13;
    1.	 Improve geographic and demographic targeting             Data visualization tools such as mapping can improve&#13;
        to reach populations where water and sanitation          targeting by identifying the coexistence of nutritionally&#13;
        coverage is low and undernutrition is high               vulnerable populations and poor WASH access. A recent&#13;
    2.	 Utilize best practices in behavior change and insights   initiative undertaken jointly between the Water and&#13;
        from behavioral economics to maximize the impact         Sanitation Program and the Poverty Practice compiled&#13;
        of WBG operations on nutrition                           population census data on access to sanitation in Vietnam&#13;
    3.	 Leverage the program-for-results lending instrument      and presented this side-by-side with rates of child stunting&#13;
        and other institutional incentives to align WASH         to highlight areas of the country where these burdens&#13;
        and nutrition objectives                                 coexist. The resulting maps (Figure 8) informed the design&#13;
    4.	 Incorporate nutrition-sensitive objectives and           of a Program-for-Results (PforR) operation on Scaling&#13;

but not sufficient for meeting nutrition objectives.&#13;
Two recent rigorous evaluations of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s flagship rural                         To date, behavioral economics has not been fully&#13;

hand hygiene (Pickering et al. 2010) reintroduce disease-                         2014). For instance, people dislike losses more than gains&#13;
causing pathogens, and for handwashing facilities, which                          (loss aversion), so messages that highlight costs and losses&#13;
are a poor predictor of actual handwashing rates (Ram etÂ al.                      are likely to be more effective (Kahneman and Tversky&#13;
2014). Without adequate and consistently practiced WASH                           1979). In other words, it may be more effective to tell&#13;
behaviors, such as handwashing with soap, water treatment                         people they will be sicker and poorer if they do not wash&#13;
and safe handling practices, and use of latrines, infrastructure                  their hands. This is counter to the predominant messaging&#13;

World Bank Group WASH lending operations in the past.&#13;
Behavior change elements of lending projects are dwarfed                          A new concept, termed â&#128;&#156;baby-wash,â&#128;&#157; is also drawing&#13;

there is limited capacity both within the WBG and in                              interventions that address child-specific or child-related&#13;
client countries to conduct state-of-the-art behavior change                      behaviors and risk factors, such as frequent mouthing of&#13;

Taking It Further                                                                 from poor waste disposal practices. Traditional WASH&#13;
Although still not a science, evidence is emerging about                          infrastructure investments have largely bypassed some of&#13;
how to scale up effective behavior change for water,                              these dominant fecal contamination pathways that affect&#13;
sanitation, and hygiene. In the hierarchy of behaviors, using                     small children.&#13;
a toilet and handwashing with soap seem to matter most for&#13;
stopping the spread of pathogens. Treating water to remove                        Technical assistance to clients in both the Water and&#13;
fecal pathogens before drinking it and using clean water for                      Nutrition sectors can help bring these best practices into&#13;
cooking are also important, especially as there is no guarantee                   project design and implementation and help to achieve&#13;
that these other behaviors have been practiced consistently.                      behavioral complianceâ&#128;&#148;itself a precondition for nutrition&#13;
However, experience shows that just teaching people about                         outcomes. Likewise, closer coordination between WASH,&#13;
these behaviors is not enough since knowledge is already                          nutrition, and agriculture colleagues can help address&#13;
high in many contexts. We also know that telling people                           a major source of disease-causing pathogens in some&#13;
about the health benefits of these behaviors is not the most                      contexts.&#13;

     Lending Instrument and Other                                                                been limited to water, sewerage, or sanitation connections.&#13;
     Institutional Incentives to Align                                                           Associating disbursement linked indicators (DLIs) with&#13;
     WASH and Nutrition Objectives                                                               behavioral, health, or nutrition intermediate outcomes could&#13;
                                                                                                 incentivize projects to improve targeting and implementation,&#13;
     Current Status                                                                              with resulting impacts on health and nutrition.&#13;
     Lack of incentives at both the project and institutional&#13;
     levels has limited multisectoral collaboration. Institutional                               Taking It Further&#13;
     barriers exist in the World Bank Group in the form of staff                                 Institutional levers can be used to align incentives of TTLs&#13;
     time allocation, sector-specific budgets, and project coding                                and managers with multisectoral approaches. Recent reforms&#13;
     systems that effectively disallow ownership of projects by                                  and restructuring that aim to institutionalize and incentivize&#13;
     multiple sectors. Integration is viewed as cumbersome to                                    cross-sectoral solutions to development challenges present a&#13;
     manage and risky to achievement of project objectives,                                      unique opportunity. Most notably, movement toward the&#13;
     despite demonstrating similar performance in practice                                       twin poverty alleviation goals aiming for reduced extreme&#13;
     (IEG 2009).                                                                                 poverty and increased shared prosperity motivate a shift&#13;
                                                                                                 in thinking toward the bottom 40 percent. Targeting will&#13;
     Institutional resources exist for supporting cross-sectoral                                 become more important as the World Bank Group works&#13;
     work, but may not be fully utilized. For instance, the                                      toward these twin goals, and can help bring actors together&#13;
     Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) has set                                        to develop multisectoral solutions that can best meet the&#13;
     aside $100 million in grants for sectors outside health that                                needs of this population. Secondly, the new Global Practice&#13;
     incorporate a results-based financing mechanism linked to                                   structure can be a unique facility to (i) identify cross-&#13;
     health outputs and outcomes, but use of these funds for                                     sectoral solutions and (ii) provide a supportive environment&#13;
     nonhealth sectors has been limited.                                                         for multiple sectors to work toward the same goal. Country&#13;
                                                                                                 directors and practice leads can be crucial leverage points early&#13;
     Incentives operate at the project level as well. Results-based                              in a project because of their frequent role as chair of concept&#13;
     approaches4 are increasingly mainstreamed for achieving                                     note reviews, which places them in a position to ask critical&#13;
     desirable outcomes in development, and could be an effective                                questions, and their mandate to collaborate across sectors.&#13;
     instrument to incentivize WASH projects to incorporate                                      Practice managers play a role in influencing TTLs (and other&#13;
     nutrition-sensitive objectives. Experience to date using                                    PMs) through email and other communications. Peer-to-&#13;
     results-based approaches in water and sanitation is limited.                                peer engagement across sectors is also important, where&#13;
     A review undertaken by the WBG indicated that less than                                     TTLs working alongside each other in the same country,&#13;

     OBA in water and sanitation has since increased under the                                   framework. Within this context, earmarking of resources&#13;
     Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA), which                                      for cross-sectoral operations could spur further innovative&#13;

     The WBGâ&#128;&#153;s new PforR lending instrument currently has                                        Despite reforms underway in the WBG and the opportunity&#13;

            Multisectoral approaches to improving
            nutrition : water, sanitation, and hygiene
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
            was recognized in the report as a key sector for maximizing
            nutritional impact, but was not covered in depth as part of
            the self-contained guidance notes originally produced.
            Emerging evidence in the WASH sector suggests the linkages
            between WASH and nutrition may be stronger than previously
            understood. This has generated a great deal of momentum in
            both the WASH and nutrition sectors about how the two can
            work more closely to achieve better outcomes. This paper
            addresses this objective from both the WASH perspective, on
            how nutrition-specific programs (as well as
            nutrition-sensitive social protection, livelihoods, and
            community-driven development programs) can provide an
            alternative platform to deliver services at scale and more
            cost-effectively; and the nutrition perspective, on how WASH
            interventions can be adapted to include nutritional
            considerations, making them more nutrition-sensitive, and
            more impactful on nutrition. This document outlines the
            rationale for nutrition-sensitive WASH, summarizes the
            scientific evidence on the pathways through which WASH
            impacts nutritional outcomes, discusses the challenges and
            opportunities for nutrition sensitive WASH, and proposes a
            set of practical strategies and enhancements to existing
            project design that offer promising opportunities to impact
            nutritional outcomes. Despite well-known challenges to
            effective integration, an emerging interest in and attention
            to the role of WASH, and sanitation in particular, on
            nutritional outcomes provides a ‘window of opportunity’ to
            influence policy and program design for greater impacts on nutrition.
