    In Vietnam and Peru, handwashing initiatives within the                     siblings. Therefore, in Vietnam the program focus was on&#13;
    primary school setting, are increasing studentsâ&#128;&#153; handwashing                handwashing with soap to prevent others from getting sick.&#13;
    with soap rates by using entertainment education approaches.                In Peru, children in most areas were motivated to â&#128;&#156;helpâ&#128;? their&#13;
    The initiatives were supported by the Water and Sanitation                  families to overcome certain burdens to come out of poverty.&#13;
    Program (WSP) through the Global Scaling Up Handwashing                     Children are therefore, motivated to influence their elders,&#13;
    Project. In Vietnam, the Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union facilitated the                      to the program focused on their ability to became agents of&#13;
    training of 1,200 headmasters and teachers who carried                      change and some messages asked of them to remind their&#13;
    out handwashing activities in over 600 schools in 15                        mothers to wash their hands with soap before cooking. Both&#13;
    provinces across the country. In total, over 340,000 students               programs utilized fun and games with a superhero character&#13;
    were reached. In Peru, the Handwashing Initiative was                       that used soap to help others. However, the messaging and&#13;
    mainstreamed into the Ministry of Educationâ&#128;&#153;s system,                       mechanisms for relaying messages differed according to the&#13;
    through the Safe, Clean and Healthy Schools Program that                    results of the research.&#13;
    was implemented in 24 regions and trained 14,000 teachers&#13;
    who worked with 285,000 students.                                           The fact that teachers needed incentives was also a key&#13;
                                                                                lesson. In Peru, teachers were overburdened with activities&#13;
    Although both countries based their program development                     and capacity-building sessions. Teachers needed to perceive a&#13;
    on a common framework under the Global Handwashing                          concrete benefit from additional commitments. Linking the&#13;
    Scaling Up Project, their implementation strategies were                    HWI program to performance indicators and recognizing&#13;
    markedly different. The need for formative research insights                progress by means of certifications, proved to be effective&#13;
    that would help drive the design of the programs was a key                  because it translated in increases in teachersâ&#128;&#153; salary rates. In&#13;
    lesson from those programs. One relevant finding common to                  Vietnam, equipping teachers with a different approach to&#13;
    both countries was the fact that children already understood                hygiene promotion and giving them simple tools that they&#13;
    the value of washing hands to combat germs. That was a                      could immediately integrate into their lessons proved to be&#13;
    platform used in building the programs. Research in Vietnam                 an invaluable incentive.&#13;
    revealed that children had very little free time and that&#13;
    teachers were already overburdened with a heavy curriculum.                 In both countries, a key aspect of the programs was the capacity&#13;
    Therefore, the entertainment education approach was used to                 to be a bridge between the school and the home and to link&#13;
    develop games and activities as extracurricular activities that             children to the larger community. In Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s caretakers&#13;
    would complement rather than compete with the existing                      program, grandparents received messages on the importance&#13;
    curriculum. In Peru, the curriculum became the entry point                  of washing their own hands at key times. They also received&#13;
    for the program, particularly because the Education Ministry                guidance on how to play games with their grandchildren to&#13;
    was ready to improve the national hygiene curriculum though                 help reinforce handwashing with soap messages delivered in&#13;
    policy development and regulations.                                         schools. In both countries, mass media helped to link children&#13;
                                                                                to the larger community. In the case of Vietnam, it reinforced&#13;
    In both countries, the formative research sought to                         the school-based handwashing activities through national&#13;
    understand whether the children could act as agents of                      television programs, publications, and drawing contests. In&#13;
    change in their households and schools. In Vietnam, the                     Peruâ&#128;&#153;s case, radio campaigns were supported by interpersonal&#13;
    ideal child was docile and submissive and unlikely to be able               programs carried out in schools and elsewhere in each district&#13;
    to influence adults. Children could, however, influence their               where the project was implemented.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Both case studies also offered suggestions on how to integrate&#13;
handwashing with soap to increase its occurrence rate, by&#13;
partnering with other actors in the water, sanitation and&#13;
health sector or by mainstreaming handwashing with soap&#13;
into education systems through policy, regulation and&#13;
rewards. Regardless of the approach taken, both country case&#13;
studies demonstrated that getting more children to wash their&#13;
hands with soap was achievable.&#13;
&#13;
Project impact evaluation analyses in both countries are&#13;
currently underway and the lessons provided in the present&#13;
document are based on monitoring analysis of the behavioral&#13;
change process in primary schools over the 2008 to 2010&#13;
period. Growing demand by national and local authorities&#13;
to continue, scale up and further integrate approaches and&#13;
tools developed by the project will lead to additional learning.&#13;
These lessons should provide useful insights for governments,&#13;
practitioners (including teachers and educators), NGOs and&#13;
donors, who are interested in implementing a handwashing&#13;
program in primary schools.&#13;

    Up Handwashing Project aims to expand handwashing                                        and community. By sharing information from school with the&#13;
    practices among women of reproductive age (15-49 years)                                  family, questioning existing practices at home, and influencing&#13;
    and primary school-aged children (5 to 12 in Peru; 6 to 10                               the behavior of siblings in their care, children can change their&#13;
    in Vietnam) The Project focuses on applying innovative                                   own behavior and that of others. Both Peru and Vietnam&#13;
    promotional approaches to generate widespread and                                        have high primary school enrolment ratios.2 It was therefore&#13;

    Started in December 2006, the project is implemented by                                  soap by primary school-aged children on the primary school&#13;
    local and national governments with technical support from                               setting. Within this setting, efforts included learning about&#13;
    WSP, and participation from the private sector and non-                                  and practicing handwashing with soap.&#13;

    The Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project aims to show                                   though they were one component of a wider handwashing&#13;
    which methods to stimulate and sustain behavior change at                                with soap implementation campaign. Both countries had&#13;
    scale work and have an impact on health. The purpose of                                  already promoted handwashing for other target groups.&#13;
    this working paper is to share that knowledge, by presenting                             Complementary community programs targeting womenâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
    two case studies about changing the handwashing behavior                                 often the mothers and caretakers of those same school&#13;
    of primary school childrenâ&#128;&#148;in Vietnam and Peru. Although                                 childrenâ&#128;&#148;were implemented concurrently with the schools&#13;
    the programs operate in different country contexts, and use                              program. Direct consumer contact and mass media activities&#13;
    different approaches to achieve behavior change, the common                              and the interpersonal communication of the schools program&#13;
    and the unique experiences of these two countries provide                                were carried out simultaneously, and reinforced the change in&#13;
    lessons for others. Similarities include child-focused research                          knowledge, attitudes, and practices of primary school children.&#13;
    undertaken to understand the barriers to handwashing with                                WSP provided a common framework, a standard approach&#13;
    soap, the use of entertainment education, and the need                                   and tools to assist the project implementation in both Peru and&#13;
    to build teachersâ&#128;&#153; skills and tools to effectively publicize                             Vietnam. One such tool was the framework called â&#128;&#156;FOAMâ&#128;?&#13;
    handwashing with soap. Differences are due to the social and                             (Focus, Opportunity, Ability, Motivation), developed by WSP&#13;
    geographical contexts of each country, the leadership role                               as a common conceptual framework for all four countries&#13;
    taken by government, the cultural differences of children as                             taking part in the Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project.&#13;
    agents of change, the degree of interaction between parents                              FOAM provided a way to analyze handwashing behaviors in&#13;
    and schools, and the education systems themselves.                                       order to design effective handwashing programs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     To overcome the schoolsâ&#128;&#153; lack of handwashing facilities,&#13;
     during the training courses teachers and principals learned&#13;
     how to develop low-cost handwashing stations. Rather&#13;
     than wait for large-scale investments to improve their water&#13;
     and sanitation facilities, teachers, headmasters or parents&#13;
     associations could purchase plastic buckets and plastic water&#13;
     dippers, which were inexpensive and available everywhere in&#13;
     Vietnam. Teachers are advised to put soap bars inside loosely&#13;
     woven fabrics so the soap remained inside a container at all&#13;
     times and could be more easily managed.&#13;
&#13;
     After their training, teachers went back to their own&#13;
     schools and shared the ideas, experience and activities with&#13;
     other teachers. They then worked together to plan the&#13;
     implementation of handwashing with soap activities for the                  it makes a difference who attends the training. as well as the principal&#13;
     coming year.                                                                and Youth Union leader, Cho gao Primary School in tien giang province&#13;

     The Vietnam Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union, with support from WSP, led                       according to the school nurse:&#13;
     the project implementation. The Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union helped to&#13;
                                                                                 â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦Of course as a nurse I already knew about hygiene and the health&#13;
     organize the teacher training courses while WSP provided the&#13;

     materials for the training, the specialist trainer, and sets of             to improve my communications skills. I now know how to convey&#13;
     school materials. The HWI also provided a list of activities                messages to the children in a positive and interesting way. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know&#13;
     that could be included in a school implementation plan for                  this before...â&#128;?.&#13;

     Handwashing Day; drawing contests; games; and wall paper                    demonstrations in their meetings. Other schools organized&#13;
     contests, with two optional activities of a skit and additional             special days for the environment and handwashing with&#13;
     games about handwashing and hygiene. Schools received a                     soap that combined many games, competitions and&#13;
     small budget to help them carry out planned activities within               demonstrations on handwashing with soap. Teachers adapted&#13;
     one school year. Each participating school carried out five                 the Teacher Resource Guideâ&#128;&#153;s activity ideas to make skits&#13;
     extracurricular activities including entering the national                  and set up drawing contests, questions and answer quizzes,&#13;

The importance of handwashing&#13;
In Peru, diarrhea is one of the main causes of disease and                                     The HWI in Peru was implemented in two phases. The first&#13;

&#13;
Despite the health education efforts coordinated between                                       In the second phase (2007-2010), the program was redesigned&#13;

faced difficulties because segments of the population live in                                  Covering 24 of the 25 regions, the HWI aimed to reach&#13;

     research Findings&#13;
     A key finding from the school research was that, together,&#13;
     mothers, children, and teachers formed a critical information&#13;
     pathway for conveying hygiene messages. Communication&#13;
     patterns differed according to geographical areas: horizontal&#13;
     and open in the coast and rainforest, and vertical in the&#13;
     Andean region. In the first case, children communicated&#13;
     information, offered opinions freely and received feedback. In&#13;
     this setting, children became agents of change. In the second&#13;
     case, children became messengers, channeling information&#13;
     from school that was valuable to the mothers. Even in this&#13;
     case, the role of the child was important, because mothers&#13;
     needed to be updated on the news and information that came&#13;
     from the teacher, one of the most influential and respected&#13;
     persons in the community. That finding supported the HWIâ&#128;&#153;s                  motivation was their aspiration to protect their families from&#13;
     hypothesis that children were a key channel and potential                   poverty and disunity, and their willingness to take action.&#13;
     agents of change in the household.&#13;
                                                                                 Children knew that they need to wash their hands even&#13;
     The character of the family had a strong influence on                       when they did not seem dirty, and were aware of the critical&#13;
     children. For example, in the Andean region communication                   times for handwashing and the need to use soap. However,&#13;
     within the family was vertical: children may bring relevant                 that knowledge did not always translate into practice. They&#13;
     information to their mothers, but they will not engage in                   forgot about handwashing especially if they were playing&#13;
     discussions about the benefits of handwashing. The opposite                 with school friends, and did not use soap because it was not&#13;
     was true among children in the coastal or Amazonian regions.                available at school or at home. Water was not always available&#13;
     Usually children trusted their mothers the most, although                   for handwashing, as schools usually had water sporadically&#13;
     grandmothers were important, especially in rural areas.                     throughout the whole day. Children did not know about the&#13;
     Grandmothers played a role of confidants and caretakers of                  importance of using running water when washing hands and&#13;
     the smallest children. Brothers and sisters were frequently                 sometimes washing hands was more playing than washing.&#13;
     caretakers of smaller siblings, playing with them and teaching              If toilets were saturated or dirty, children did not bother to&#13;
     them, while fathers were often absent and not expected to                   wash their hands after defecating.&#13;
     participate actively in their childrenâ&#128;&#153;s lives.&#13;
                                                                                 Teachers were admired (mainly by smaller children) or&#13;
     When asked about their future during focus group sessions,                  feared. Teachers thought it was difficult to inculcate habits&#13;
     children thought about being professionals (doctors, lawyers                in children because of their home situation and tended&#13;
     or professors) in order to help other people (social motivation)            to concentrate on theoretical aspects of handwashing and&#13;
     or, according to the youngest children, simply to help their                hygiene. The level of priority given to handwashing was very&#13;
     own families. One relevant finding about childrenâ&#128;&#153;s strongest               dependent on individual teachers.&#13;

           logy has become an integral part of regional policies&#13;
           in five regions, which implies additional funding for&#13;
           hygiene promotion processes.&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Women and Social Development that&#13;
            has adapted and integrated the HWI approach, me-&#13;
            thodology and tools into two of its national programs:&#13;
            Wawa Wasi and PRONAA. Wawa Wasi is the national&#13;
            nursery program that provides, care, stimulation and&#13;
            nutrition to children up to four years. The HWI has&#13;
            strengthened the reach to the childâ&#128;&#153;s home, providing&#13;
            an added value that enhances results. PRONAA is&#13;
            a large national program that works with commu-&#13;
            nities, households and schools in 1,880 districts of&#13;
            the country to decrease malnutrition by educating&#13;
            and promoting nutrition and healthy habits. It also&#13;
            provides feeding in schools and community-based&#13;
            organizations.&#13;
&#13;
     With the integration of handwashing with soap in the school&#13;
     education program, and active support from local education&#13;
     departments, more than 3,000 schools in 24 regions have&#13;
     taken part and as many as 300,000 students have benefited&#13;
     by the program. To date, around 15,000 teachers have been&#13;
     trained in handwashing promotion. In just three years, this&#13;
     is a remarkable achievement.&#13;
&#13;
     During 2010, major public and private partners joined&#13;
     the action to promote handwashing in Peru, including the&#13;
     Ministry of Women. Also, agricultural (north) and mining&#13;
     companies (south) were funding capacity-building workshops&#13;
     for change agents, and the purchase of soap dispensers to be&#13;

&#13;
     Both country case studies on handwashing with soap for                      engage in discussions or freely express an opinion. On the&#13;
     primary school children provided important lessons for                      other hand, they correct their siblings and remind them to&#13;
     future work in Vietnam and Peru. This section provides                      handwash with soap. This occurs also in the Andean regions&#13;
     insights that may be useful for other countries that wish to                of Peru, where communication between parents and children&#13;
     implement effective handwashing with soap campaigns for                     is quite vertical. A total opposite is true of the coastal and&#13;
     primary school children at any scale.                                       Amazonian regions in this country, where children take action&#13;
                                                                                 and are talkative, and therefore become agents of change.&#13;
     Child-appropriate formative research tools reveal insights&#13;
     for effective programs                                                      Capacity building is critical&#13;
     The research methods and tools WSP used to investigate                      Skills-based training for teachers and education staff on&#13;
     schoolchildren were produced to elicit the critical information             how to communicate handwashing with soap in schools&#13;

     behaviors, knowledge and aspirations. This evidence-based                   Vietnam, teachers appreciated having this new set of skills.&#13;
     approach avoids making assumptions about what motivates                     Practical training included site visits to selected schools&#13;
     children and what prevents them from washing their hands;                   so teachers could see realistic situations and good models&#13;
     it shapes the direction and style of the behavior change                    for handwashing with soap. In Peru, teacher training and&#13;
     campaigns targeted to children.                                             capacity building were institutionalized through national&#13;

     easier for teachers to use and more interesting for children.&#13;
     Many programs focus on the effect of handwashing with soap                  Link schools with home and the community&#13;
     on the individualâ&#128;&#153;s health, but both Vietnamese and Peruvian                Schools are not islands. There are opportunities for&#13;
     children already understood the need to wash hands and the                  interaction between family and the broader community to&#13;
     relationship between germs and disease. The main problem                    support and reinforce programs for change in handwashing&#13;
     was that they often forgot or did not bother to wash hands.                 with soap behavior initiated in schools. For example, in&#13;
     Fun ways to overcome the barriers to handwashingâ&#128;&#148;the                        Vietnam and Peru grandparents were part of the program&#13;
     belief that handwashing with soap is not important, the                     because grandparents (especially grandmothers) spent a lot&#13;
     lack of peer and adult role models, and the lack of water                   of time caring for children and mothers were not always the&#13;
     and soapâ&#128;&#148;are more effective at producing lasting behavior                   most significant adult influence at home. In Peru, the HWI&#13;
     change than those focused on health alone.                                  had very strong links to the local government programs and&#13;
                                                                                 community events. Parents were encouraged to enter the&#13;

Teachers have shown that they can be adaptable and creative                 board, teachers, students and parents. In Peru, at the&#13;
when teaching about handwashing with soap, provided that                    national level, the Ministry of Education has demonstrated&#13;
they are given the skills to apply new teaching methods and                 strong commitment to the HWI program by delegating&#13;
materials such as a teacherâ&#128;&#153;s guide or manual. Training of                  staff, contributing to the programâ&#128;&#153;s technical development,&#13;
teachers should focus on building communication skills to                   enacting regulations, and communicating and supporting the&#13;
overcome the rigidity of the curriculum and to give teachers                process at all education levels. The level of results achieved&#13;
the skills to be flexible and responsive to the different                   to date would not have been possible without the political&#13;
conditions in their schools.                                                will of the Ministry of Education. An example of the power&#13;

&amp;#12;     The Power of Primary Schools to Change and Sustain Handwashing with Soap among Children   Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
     This document has presented two different case studies&#13;
     on increasing handwashing with soap practice by primary&#13;
     school children. Both the Vietnam and Peru programs took&#13;
     place mainly in the primary school setting. The case studies&#13;
     found that formative research on the behavior, beliefs and&#13;
     influences of primary school children is critical for effective&#13;
     behavior change campaigns targeting children. Teachers are&#13;
     also important advocates for handwashing with soap but they&#13;
     need the skills, materials and methodologies to implement&#13;
     handwashing with soap programs in their schools.&#13;
&#13;
     Beyond the schoolâ&#128;&#153;s immediate setting, the significance of&#13;
     cultural and contextual factors increased. The degree to&#13;
     which children were agents of change within their families&#13;
     and communities was based on local culture and customs.&#13;
     In Peru, children were important conveyers of messages to&#13;
     the home and they influenced family behavior, while in&#13;
     Vietnam, childrenâ&#128;&#153;s opinions did not influence adults. In&#13;
     both countries, children were most likely to influence their&#13;
     siblings.&#13;
&#13;
     The mainstreaming and scaling up of a handwashing with&#13;
     soap program for schoolchildren depended on leadership,&#13;
     policy and institutional setting. Implementing primary school&#13;
     handwashing with soap programs on a national scale required&#13;
     institutional commitment. In Peru, the Ministry of Education&#13;
     was quick to mainstream the program through its national&#13;
     curriculum and policy development, and its regulations.&#13;
     In Vietnam, the Ministry of Education and Training was&#13;
     not ready to take those steps. The program approach was&#13;
     therefore more informal, focusing on extracurricular activities&#13;
     to support the existing curriculum and on collaboration with&#13;
     water and sanitation projects.&#13;
&#13;
     Regardless of the approach taken, both country case studies&#13;
     demonstrate that getting more children to wash their hands&#13;
     with soap is achievable.&#13;

            The power of primary schools to change and
            sustain handwashing with soap among children : the cases of
            Vietnam and Peru
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Vietnam and Peru are two of four
            countries taking part in the Water and Sanitation Program
            (WSP) Global Scaling up Handwashing Project. Funded by the
            Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Scaling Up
            Handwashing Project aims to expand handwashing practices
            among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and primary
            school-aged children (5 to 12 in Peru; 6 to 10 in Vietnam)
            The project focuses on applying innovative promotional
            approaches to generate widespread and sustained improvement
            in handwashing with soap practice. Started in December 2006,
            the project is implemented by local and national governments
            with technical support from WSP, and participation from the
            private sector and nongovernmental organizations. The
            present document describes the approaches to changing
            children's handwashing with soap behavior, first in
            Vietnam, then Peru, followed by some lessons learned and conclusions.
