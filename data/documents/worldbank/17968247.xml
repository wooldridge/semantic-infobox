                        Aldewereld, Siem/Simon&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Dr. Robert W. Oliver, California Institute of&#13;
Technology, on 1961-07-13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Although Aldewereld officially joined the Bank in December 1946,&#13;
according to this interview his work actually started in October of&#13;
that year. He was asked to join Crena de Iongh, the newly-appointed&#13;
Treasurer, as his assistant. Prior to joining the Bank Aldewereld had&#13;
been Crena de Iongh's deputy at the Dutch Government's office in New&#13;
York. As assistant to the Treasurer his first assignment was to&#13;
forecast the amount of bonds needed on the basis of the projected&#13;
scale of lending. According to Aldewereld, the Bank was at that time&#13;
in the process of working out policies for its operations; mostly&#13;
during the first six months of 1947 where certain basic principles&#13;
were established from which the Bank has never departed. These relate&#13;
mainly to disbursements and supervision of Bank projects, which in&#13;
turn were based on project progress in accordance with the originally&#13;
agreed to criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Aldewereld elaborates with a few examples on the progress made,&#13;
especially, as the Bank tried to adjust its supervision techniques to&#13;
existing situations in the borrowing country and the effect of these&#13;
methods on American business organizations. He covers in detail, while&#13;
illustrating on specific projects, project appraisal and the evolution&#13;
of that policy, project management and learning from experience,&#13;
creditworthiness or absorptive capacity of the borrowing countries,&#13;
and the distinction between program lending and general purpose&#13;
lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Aldewereld discusses briefly the Bank's view on other granting-&#13;
type organizations, and the limiting factors in its lending, going&#13;
&amp;#12;back to the question of creditworthiness of a country. Then, the&#13;
Technical Operations Department he headed, covering mainly staff&#13;
skills, economic questions dealing with determining the type of&#13;
investments to be made, with its merits and demerits, alternative&#13;
investment achieving the same objective, effects of a project on the&#13;
balance of payments of a country, and the economic benefits of a given&#13;
investment in what is referred to as a cost-benefit analysis. Also,&#13;
the Bank's preference for lending to the private enterprise, whenever&#13;
possible, thus enabling the government concerned to have money&#13;
available for other high-priority purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     According to Aldewereld, the reorganization of 1952basically&#13;
covered the way in which projects were dealt with, since the&#13;
responsibility for project appraisal was scattered around the Bank. He&#13;
elaborates on the division of responsibility between the (his)&#13;
Department of Technical Operations and the Area Departments, as well&#13;
as the Economics Department, which was basically a research department&#13;
and its responsibilities.&#13;
