&amp;#12;&#13;
A. BACKGROUNDAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
A. 1. The Urban Water Sector inthe Reconstructionof Afghanistan&#13;
&#13;
The Conflict, the Transition and the Emergency&#13;
1.  Since December 2001 andthe inaugurationofthe AfghanistanInterim Administration(AIA)&#13;
Afghanistan's economic, social andpolitical achievements have been significant. The AIA, andthe&#13;
subsequent Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan(TISA) were confrontedwith an economy reeling&#13;
from protractedconflict and drought, more than five million people displaced as refugees inneighboring&#13;
countries, economic activities steered in an informalor illicit directionby insecurity, and a statethat had&#13;
becomevirtually non functional interms of policy makingand service delivery- althoughthe structures&#13;
and many staff remained. The achievements-various reforms inthe government, a successful&#13;
constitutionalLoya Jirga (GrandCouncil) peacefulcompletion of the country's first ever presidential&#13;
election, and the inaugurationofthe new Cabinet in December 2004, just to name a few -have been&#13;
significant,and in Afghanistan's context, commendable. The country's movetowards democracy&#13;
achieved a landmarkwhen the new Parliament was sworn in on December 19,2005. These achievements&#13;
notwithstanding,the challenges remainenormous in improvingsecuritythroughoutthe country,&#13;
reestablishing nationalunity, developinginstitutionswith a capacity to formulate and implementpolicies,&#13;
reachingout to provincesto collect revenues and deliver services, and implementingthe Government's&#13;
long-termvision for the future of Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Issues&#13;
2. As a result of lack of investment, conflict and drought duringthe last decades, andthe very rapid&#13;
urban growth in recent years, the water supply service in Afghan cities is of very poor quality. Only&#13;
Kabul(more than three millionpeople) and 13 towns with populationsrangingfrom 1,000,000 to 50,000&#13;
have piped water supply systems servinga total of only about 60,000 connections, of which 35,000 in&#13;
Kabul. Even ifthe concertedefforts of the Government andthe support of several donors have resulted in&#13;
improvements since 2002, the task ahead is daunting. Current access to pipedwater infrastructureis&#13;
amongthe lowest in the world at around 18%, and because of poor operationandmaintenance(O&amp;M) the&#13;
water service reaches an even lower share of the population. A vast majority of urban dwellers draw&#13;
small quantities o f water from generallyunsafe boreholes and open wells, springs or streams.According&#13;
to the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) which surveyed about 6,000 households in&#13;
urban areas in 2005, sources of supply can be brokendown as follows: handpumps: 42%; open wells:&#13;
34%; piped water: 18%; and springs and surface water: 6%       .&#13;
&#13;
3 , A sewerage system serves few apartment complexes in Kabul and covers less than 2% of its&#13;
population; wastewater is only partially treated before beingdischarged off inthe Kabul River. Septic&#13;
tanks andvault latrinesare not emptied regularlybecauseof lack of suctiontrucks and as a result, septage&#13;
spills over in drains. The vast majority of householdsrely on pit latrines. A rapidly declining share of the&#13;
night soil produced is usedby farmers. Intermittenceof the piped service, inadequatewater treatment and&#13;
contamination of groundwater result in a precarious sanitary situation. Largequantitiesof solidwaste are&#13;
not collectedand often pile up in streets. There is no specific facility to handlehazardous/medicalwaste.&#13;
&#13;
4. The Central Authority for Water Supply and Sewerage(CAWSS) under the Ministry of Urban&#13;
Development (MOUD)is responsible for the pipedwater supply and sewerage (WSS) service'. CAWSS&#13;
&#13;
' CAWSS is   currentlyservingthe following cities: Kabul,Herat,Kandahar,Mazar-i-Sharif,Jalalabad, Kunduz,&#13;
Taluqan, Ghazni, Gardez, Qalat, Mehterlam,Charikar, Qala-i-Now, andSheberghan. Inaddition, operations are&#13;
expectedto beginduring2007 inPul-i-Khumri,MaimanaandZaranj. See MapNo. 34686 in Section I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
i s a centralized authority, but due to communication difficulties with provincial towns during the period&#13;
o f conflict, its regional operations have acquired a certain degree o f autonomy. There is no clear&#13;
jurisdiction over point water supplies and on-site sanitation and several functional gaps and overlaps exist&#13;
between CAWSS, and municipalities; the latter usually handle solid waste collection and on-site&#13;
sanitation through local Department o f Sanitation (DOS). Current institutional arrangements do not allow&#13;
for a clear separation o f policy, supervisory and operational roles.&#13;
&#13;
5.    In2005, CAWSS employed about 700 staff, of which 400 inKabul. However, because CAWSS&#13;
salaries cannot compare with that offered by NGOs and the private sector, qualified managers and staff&#13;
can neither be retained nor be attracted. CAWSS operational, commercial and financial performance is&#13;
still very poor and most o f its branches, including Kabul, recover no more than 25% o f O&amp;M costs from&#13;
sales revenues. A tariff increase was recently approved, but collections still remain very low, partly due&#13;
to the inadequacy o f the service provided; however, recent household surveys showed that users would be&#13;
willing to pay for water service, which often ranked as their top priority. Under the Afghanistan&#13;
Reconstruction Trust Fund(ARTF) funded WSS project (Annex l),            a Financial Support to Operations&#13;
(FSO)was put in place in mid-2005 to help CAWSS complement its collection o f user charges to meet&#13;
current O&amp;M expenditures, allow payment o f salaries and energy bills on a more regular basis, and&#13;
improve overall operational and commercial performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A. 2. GovernmentResponse and Sector DevelopmentStrategy&#13;
&#13;
6. The Government is considering urban WSS as a top priority and indeed it i s the largest component o f&#13;
the UrbanNational Priority Program. MOUDhas prepared a Short-Term Program (STP - 2005-07) and is&#13;
finalizing a Medium-Term Program (MTP 2007-11) to channel efforts by donors who support the&#13;
                                               -&#13;
sector. The urban WSS sector has also been identified as a priority inthe Interim Afghanistan National&#13;
Development Strategy (I-ANDs) o f January 2006 presented at the London Donor conference o f February&#13;
2006; in particular as part o f its effort to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), the&#13;
Government envisages that 50% o f households in Kabul and 30% o f households in major urban centers&#13;
will have access to piped water by 2010. In2003-2005, a total o f about US$50 million have already been&#13;
invested for emergency rehabilitation projects inthe urban WSS sector, mostly financed by the German&#13;
Development Bank (KfW), IDA, USAID, JICA and ARTF. Despite a difficult working environment,&#13;
encouraging results are being achieved in Kabul and 12 provincial towns; also, implementation capacities&#13;
have been built both in M O U D and CAWSS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
with the announcement o f its Urban WSS Sector Policy (Annex lo), Urban WSS Sector Institutional&#13;
7. In late 2005 and early 2006, the Government took major steps on the policy and institutional fronts&#13;
&#13;
Development Plan (IDP Annex 11) and the Presidential Decree to corporatize CAWSS (Annex 12).&#13;
                           -&#13;
According to the Sector Policy, the Government's vision for the urban WSS reads: "The urban water&#13;
supply and sanitation sector shall be reformed and developed to improve the quality of life in all urban&#13;
communities. By ensuring an equitableprovision ofpotable water and wastewater services at an&#13;
affordable cost and on a sustainable basis, poverty will be reduced, health generally improved and&#13;
economic developmentpromoted". The main objectives and implications o f the Sector Policy are to: (i)&#13;
improve sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in accordance with the MDG; (ii)&#13;
provide the basis for the adoption o f technical standards and delivery mechanisms, to suit the needs o f&#13;
urban and peri-urban settlements; (iii)prepare for the decentralization o f service delivery from one central&#13;
authority to local autonomous entities and provide for community consultation and involvement and the&#13;
participation o f civic organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs); (iv) ensure improved&#13;
O&amp;M o f the WSS infrastructure; and (v) place emphasis on full cost recovery and the financial&#13;
sustainability o f the service providers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. BANK RESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
B. 1.TransitionalSupport Strategy Framework&#13;
&#13;
8.  In its "Transitional Support Strategy" for Afghanistan, IDA identified WSS as a priority. IDA has&#13;
beenone o fthe key actors inthe sector since 2003 throughthe Emergency InfrastructureReconstruction&#13;
Project(EIRP),the urban WSS ARTF Short-TermProject(Annex l), technical, institutional,&#13;
                                                                      various&#13;
legal studies and consensus-buildingactivities (Annex 8). The Government has indicatedthat it wishes&#13;
IDA to play a lead role in coordinatingassistanceto the urban WSS sector. IDA is thus ideally positioned&#13;
to support the urban WSS MTP. As institutionsare progressively beingstrengthened, it is estimatedthat&#13;
the sector could possibly absorb an investment program o f about US$200million duringthe 2007-11&#13;
period.However, to date only about a third of this amount has beencommittedby donors, mostlythe&#13;
GermanDevelopmentCooperationand IDA.The Governmentwould expect additional contributions&#13;
form other major donors such as the US (USAID), Japanese (JICA) cooperationagencies andARTF, for&#13;
extension o f existing and constructionof new urbanWSS systems inKabul andprovincial cities and for&#13;
assistingthe institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B. 2. Mobilizationof ExternalResources and CoordinationMechanisms&#13;
&#13;
9. Since 2002, IDA has beenactively supportingthe Government in its effortsto coordinate donor&#13;
activitiesinthe urban WSS sector, notably by: (i)financinga full-time urbanWSS advisor inMOUD; (ii)&#13;
supporting several stakeholder workshops; and (iii) coordinatingwith the maindonors notablythe&#13;
GermanDevelopment Agencies and USAID. The proposedproject has beenjointly appraisedandwill be&#13;
jointly supervised with the GermanDevelopmentBank (KfW) -a maindonor still active inthe sector&#13;
after 2005. Table 2 in Annex 1 providesa summary of past and current donor support to the UWSS&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B. 3. Lessonsfrom Earlier Experiencein Afghanistan and Similar Countries&#13;
&#13;
10. The lack of Government capacity to design and implementprojects has beenthe most critical&#13;
constraint affectingthis and other sectors andtemporary measures, such as the provisionof Project&#13;
ImplementationUnits (PIUs), staffed by foreign consultants, have provento be unsustainable. While&#13;
there will be a continuingneed for extensive TechnicalAssistance, the proposedprojectaims to reach&#13;
sustainabilityby: (i) moving from a simple projectto a more comprehensive sector approach; and (ii)&#13;
investinginthe development ofthe capacity of permanent institutionsstaffedby Afghan nationalsto&#13;
whom adequatetrainingand financial incentivesto performwould be provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.4.Rationalefor BankInvolvement&#13;
&#13;
11. The Government gives a high priority to IDA involvement in the urbanand urbanWSS sectors.&#13;
Because of its strong in-countrypresence and development leadership in several other sectors, IDA is&#13;
well positionedto foster donor collaborationinthe urbanWSS sector and helpaccelerate urban&#13;
development. IDA is already supportingseveral projectsinthe urbansector: (i)the US$25 million Kabul&#13;
UrbanReconstructionProject (KURP) under implementation;(ii) the US$41million Short-termUrban&#13;
WSS Project (financedby ARTF) under implementationfinances WSS investments in Kabuland 12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
provincial towns; and (iii)an Urban Waste Management Project (UWMP), under preparation. The Urban&#13;
Water Sector Project will complement these activities, all aimed at improving livingconditions in cities&#13;
that are fast becoming a main engine o f economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
C.l. Project objectives&#13;
&#13;
12. The project objectives will be to initiate actions to: (i)transform CAWSS into a technically viable&#13;
operation; (ii)establish the financial sustainability o f the Afghan Urban Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Company (AUWSSC - CAWSS' successor); (iii)increase access to and reliability o f the water supply&#13;
service in Kabul; and (iv) prepare a follow-up project under which more substantial institutional and&#13;
financial objectives could be achieved and coverage further expanded inKabul and provincial towns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.2. ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
13. To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project will include three main components (details in&#13;
Annex 2): (i)institutional development o f AUWSSC; (ii)financial support to AUWSSC operations; and&#13;
(iii)anextensionoftheKabulwatersupplysystem. Theproposedprojectwillbefinancedinparallelby&#13;
KfW and GTZ.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.2.I. Component I -Institutional Development of AUWSSC&#13;
&#13;
14. CorporatizationofAUWSSC. The Institutional Development Plan (IDP -Annex 11) plans to&#13;
transform CAWSS into a public corporation, owner o fthe urban WSS assets and responsible for their&#13;
development and for the overall quality o f the WSS service provided in urban centers. The Presidential&#13;
Decree (Annex 12) to create AUWSSC that will replace CAWSS was signed on January 25,2006.&#13;
AUWSSC will be managed by a Board o f Directors appointed by the Ministry o f Finance (MOF) and&#13;
MOUD. The Board will likely include representatives o f MOF, MOUD, Ministryin charge o f Water&#13;
Resources, representatives of Local Governments, representatives o f domestic customers, businesses&#13;
and/or other key stakeholders. Consultants to assist inthe corporatization of AUWSSC, financed by the&#13;
Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), are expected to mobilize by August 2006 and to&#13;
complete their assignment by August 2007. MOF and MOUDhave already established the Working&#13;
Group, as requested by the Decree, to carry out the initial steps required for transforming CAWSS into&#13;
AUWSSC. Apart from beingthe main counterpart to the above corporatizationconsultants, the Working&#13;
Group will act as interim Board o f Directors and select AUWSSC Management and Technical Assistance&#13;
teams (paras. 18 and 19). It has been agreed that CAWSS will be fully corporatized, Le., its statutes&#13;
approved, its Board o f Directors appointed and its Management Team appointedby December 3 1,2006.&#13;
&#13;
15. AUWSSC's Role asAsset Holding Company. AUWSSC will eventually sub-contract the provision&#13;
o f the WSS service to public (or private) operators and monitor their performance. MOUDpreferred&#13;
mediumterm institutional arrangement are: (i)Kabul (andpossibly Herat, Mazar, Kunduz/Taluqan): sub-&#13;
contract operations to a locally incorporated private operator with a majority share held by an&#13;
international professional operator; (ii)Kandahar, Jalalabad (andpossibly Herat, Mazar,&#13;
Kunduz/Taluqan): sub-contract WSS operations to autonomous local public operators as (or if) the private&#13;
sector is unlikely to be interested in operating inthese cities; (iii)11smaller centers with existing&#13;
networks: still have the WSS service provided by AUWSSC, as the local capacity i s unlikely to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sufficientto support an autonomous local public operator; and(iv) 17 new small centers: develop WSS&#13;
systems and manageservice under "Design, Build, Operate-DBO" schemes with local private&#13;
companies or NGOs or by AUWSSC itself. Duringan interimperiodhowever, WSS operations inlarge&#13;
citieswill be run by decentralized Strategic Business Units (SBUs) that will still be part of AUWSSC.&#13;
&#13;
16.     MOU betweenAUWSSCZYQ and SBUs. AUWSSC headquarters (HQ) and SBUs will enter into&#13;
Memorandums of Understanding(MOUs). It has beenagreedthat a draft standard MOU will be&#13;
submittedto IDA for review not later than June 30,2007 andthat all MOUs betweenAUWSSC/HQ and&#13;
SBUs will be signednot later thanJune 30, 2008. The MOU, in principlesignedfor a five-yearperiod&#13;
between AUWSSC/HQ and a SBU, will clarify: (i) the investmentprogramAUWSSCMQ is committed&#13;
to implementand the additionalproductionand distributioncapacities to be created; (ii) minimum&#13;
                                                                                           the&#13;
service standardsthe SBUwill haveto be achieve (water production,water sales, permanenceo f service,&#13;
pressure, metering, billing and collection...); (iii)the minimumfinancial standards (working ratio,&#13;
accounts receivable...)the SBUwill have to achieve; (iv) the financial assistanceAUWSSC is committed&#13;
to provideto complement revenue from user charges (paras. 23 and 24); and (v) the format andthe&#13;
frequency of the reportingby SBU on their technical, commercialand financial operations to&#13;
AUWSSC/HQ.&#13;
&#13;
17. AUWSSC's Role as ImplementingAgency. AUWSSC/HQ will eventually become an Asset Holding&#13;
Company (AHC), mostly responsible for developingurban WSS infrastructure. Itwill be a lean&#13;
company, with only two smalltechnical and financial departments. EstablishingAUWSSC project&#13;
implementation,procurement andfinancial managementcapacity is one of the project objectivesthat will&#13;
be achieved by assisting in the recruitmentof managersand providingtechnical assistance andtraining.&#13;
Before the end o f the projecthowever, financialmanagementfunctionswill still have to be performed&#13;
with the support of the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) ofthe Treasury Department, MOF. Because&#13;
AUWSSCiHQ cannot yet fully play the role of implementingagency, Le., carry-outprocurement and&#13;
financial managementoperations, IDA will not enter into a ProjectAgreement with AUWSSC.&#13;
&#13;
18. AUWSSCManagement Team. As part o f the corporatizationprocess, the following AUWSSC&#13;
managementteam will be recruited:(i)General Manager; (ii)TechnicalManager; (iii)        Financial&#13;
Manager; (iv) WSS OperationOfficer in charge of assistanceto smaller towns, and (v) heads ofthe&#13;
following six SBUs: Kabul, Mazar,Jalalabad, Kandahar, Herat,KundudTaluqan. The AUWSSC&#13;
managementstaffwill be competitivelyrecruitedafter local and internationaladvertisement; they will be&#13;
offered fixed term contracts for an initial two-yearperiod(with a possibilityof extension) that will clearly&#13;
specify the performanceto be achieved as well as a "market based" compensationpackagethat will&#13;
includea salary and a significant bonus (say up to 30% ofthe salary) ifcontractualobjectives, in&#13;
particularbill collection,are achieved. The Working Group will follow arecruitmentprocedure similar&#13;
to the Bank "Selection of IndividualConsultants" procedure. The selectionof each staff, hidher&#13;
individualcontract includingsalary and maximumbonus andthe performance indicatorsagainst which&#13;
the bonusmay bepaidwill be submittedto IDA for review andno objection. Ithas been agreedthat that&#13;
AUWSSC/HQ key managerswill be recruitedby December 31,2006 andthat all other AUWSSC/HQ&#13;
and SBU management staffwill be fully recruitedby December 3 1, 2007, at the latest.&#13;
&#13;
19. TechnicalAssistance to AUWSSC. Table 1 summarizes the TechnicalAssistance (TA) arrangement&#13;
agreeduponwith MOUD, CAWSS andthe GermanDevelopmentCooperation. TA to the SBUof Kabul,&#13;
Herat, and Kundun`Taluqan will be providedby the German DevelopmentAgencies (KfW andGTZ) for&#13;
an initial periodoftwo years, with the possibility of extension to three years or more, dependinguponthe&#13;
outcome o fthe selection of a privateoperator (para. 20). IDA will finance (i)a Senior TechnicalAdvisor&#13;
to AUWSSC General Manager (36 months), with a strong background in planning, projectdesign and&#13;
implementation, procurement and capacitybuilding of counterpart technicalmanagers and engineers; (ii)&#13;
a Senior FinancialAdvisor to AUWSSC General Manager (36 months), with a strong background in&#13;
&#13;

21, Public Private Partnership. The IDP envisages, for its second phase of implementation, the&#13;
possibility of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP). Early in 2005, MOUD (with PPIAF support) organized&#13;
a market sounding among international operators to check their interest in a Management Contract (MC)&#13;
for Kabul and the other cities listed above and to identify the guaranteesto be put in place to arrive at an&#13;
arrangementsatisfactory to all parties. While a few operators seemed to be interested, the Government&#13;
will know what can actually be implemented only when bids are open. The project will finance the&#13;
services of a consulting firm to assist AUWSSC design a realistic PPP and select an operator; this&#13;
consulting firm i s expectedto mobilize early in 2007. Based on experience in similar projects: (i)&#13;
operators could be pre-qualified by June 2007; (ii)bidding documents could be distributedby September&#13;
2007; (iii)a final bid evaluation report could be cleared by June 2008; and (iv) an operator could mobilize&#13;
by September 2008. It would not be realistic to envisage that an operator could mobilize earlier than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
about September 2008. The Management Contract itself would be financed, ifnecessary, under a follow-&#13;
up project.&#13;
&#13;
22. Other Consultancies,Audits, Training. Inaddition to the above, the project will finance (see details&#13;
in Annex 2): (i)up to 24 man months o f visiting specialists to assist AUWSSCLIQ and SBUs inthe&#13;
drafting o f operation, procurement, accounting and financial management procedures, commercial&#13;
activities, social and environmental management, and for advising on human resources development and&#13;
training activities; (ii)social surveys, tariffstudies, services to thepoor, consultation and communication:&#13;
to prepare future projects in Kabul and other cities, including options to serve the poor and informal&#13;
settlements, customer surveys, willingness to pay assessments, stakeholder consultation and&#13;
communication campaigns; (iii)feasibility studies, detailed designs and bidding documentsfor future&#13;
projects in Kabul (water and wastewater) and other urban centers, including assessments o f social,&#13;
environmental and water resource development issues; (iv) audits o f AUWSSC/HQ and each SBU&#13;
financial statements; and (v) training abroad: focusing mostly on planning, project management,&#13;
procurement, commercial management, accounting and financial management, and inAfghanistan: for&#13;
AUWSSC/HQ and SBU WSS operational staff focusing on plant management, network operation and&#13;
plumbing. An updated training program will be submitted by AUWSSC to IDA for review every six&#13;
months; it will include the names and functions o f staff to be trained, the content o f the proposed training&#13;
and the proposed budget.It has been agreed that a first training program will be presented not later than&#13;
June 30,2007.&#13;

C.2.2. Component2 -Financial Assistance toAUWSSC&#13;
&#13;
23. AUWSSCSltort TermPerformance Improvement. The second main objective o f the project is to&#13;
initiate actions to establish AUWSSC financial sustainability. The Financial Support to Operations (FSO)&#13;
sub-project financed by ARTF is now generating data on the number o f billed connections, sales,&#13;
production, operating costs and revenues for each of CAWSS operations and headquarters. However&#13;
these data are still based on a limited period o f time o f about six months and cannot yet be considered as&#13;
fully being representative. Annex 2 includes a rapid analysis of AUWSSC current and future&#13;
performance and suggests reasonable improvement targets as well as needed tariff adjustment and needed&#13;
financial support to AUWSSC operations. Recommendations o f Annex 2 are summarized inTable 2.&#13;
&#13;
         Table2: Summary of Performance Objectives, Tariff Adjustmentand Financial Support&#13;

                                                        7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24. Financial Support to AUWSSC Operations.It has been agreed that: (i)            AUWSSC will be entitled to&#13;
claim the reimbursement o f 45%, 30% and 15% o f reasonable2operating expenses upon presentation o f&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOE) detailing eligible bills (energy, chemicals, parts, small repair contracts&#13;
for regular maintenance, operating costs, etc.) and salary slips o f non managerial staff, this within the&#13;
limit o f US$1.90 million, US$1SO million and US$1.OO million equivalent inyears 2007 (matching&#13;
Afghan year 1387), 2008 (matching Afghan year 1388) and 2009 (matching Afghan year 1389)&#13;
respectively.; (ii)claims for advances to AUWSSC will be approved based on a satisfactory cash forecast,&#13;
submitted at the beginning o f each quarter for the three months to come and providing a detailed SOE for&#13;
the expenses paid from the prior quarter's advance; any unspent advance from the previous quarter will be&#13;
deducted from the subsequent quarter's advance. It was similarly agreed that adjustment for the financial&#13;
support for each period o f 12 months will be made on the basis o fjustifications submitted not later than&#13;
three (3) months after the end o f the 12-month period; (iii)AUWSSC will be entitled to claim the&#13;
reimbursement o f the salaries paid to its management staff (para. 18) upon presentation o f salary slips and&#13;
within the limits o f US$0.30 million equivalent per year inyears 2007 (matching Afghan year 1387),&#13;
2008 (matching Afghan year 1388)and 2009 (matching Afghan year 1389) respectively ;(iv) AUWSSC&#13;
will be entitled to claim the reimbursement o fthe bonus paid to its management staff with the limit o f&#13;
US$O.10 million equivalent per year in years 2007 (matching Afghan year 1387), 2008 (matching Afghan&#13;
year 1388)and 2009 (matching Afghan year 1389)respectively; (v) external auditors will be requested to&#13;
undertake an audit and confirm every six months that (a) AUWSSC operating expenses, and SOE claims&#13;
for reimbursement, are "reasonable", i.e., in line with international good practice and supported by&#13;
available records (source documentation) ;(b) AUWSSC management staff for whom payment o f salaries&#13;
i s requested have been active in their position for the full duration for which the reimbursement i s&#13;
claimed; and (c) the payment o f bonus to AUWSSC management staff isjustified by the achievement o f&#13;
the performance specified intheir contract.&#13;
&#13;
25. TariffAdjustment. Improving AUWSSC Working Ratio is unlikely to be achieved simply by&#13;
improving commercial operations (metering, billingand collection) and reducing operating costs, such as&#13;
pumping costs, and by reducing physical leaks. Thus, it will be necessary to envisage increasing the&#13;
average revenue per cubic meter (m3) o f water billed and collected. Based on the above assumptions&#13;
made for key performance indicators, this would require raisingthe average revenue per m3 billed and&#13;
collected to about Afg 7.0/m3, Afg 8.5/m3 and Afg 10.0/m3 in 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively; these&#13;
figures have to be.compared with an estimated average tariff o f about Afg 5.0/m3 in 2005 and (probably)&#13;
2006. It has been agreed that AUWSSC will take measures necessary to ensure that its O&amp;M costs are&#13;
covered by the total o f the above financial support and its own collection o f user charges.&#13;
&#13;
26. Adjustment of the Financial Support. It has been agreed that a review, and ifnecessary a revision,&#13;
of the amount and conditions o f the financial support to be provided to AUWSSC will take place after six&#13;
(6) months o f operation, when more reliable operating data are available (see results monitoring&#13;
indicators in Annex 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.2.3. Component 3 -Extension of the Kabul WaterSupply System&#13;
&#13;
27. The third objective o f the project will be to increase access to and reliability o f the water supply&#13;
service in Kabul, by developing the first phase o f the Logar I1scheme. This scheme was selected on the&#13;
basis of the KfW-financed Feasibility Study for the Expansion o f the Kabul Water Supply System o f&#13;
January 2004, which identified it as a priority. The same scheme had been appraised by IDA in 1978&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  "Reasonable" is defined as being in line with international good practice.Technical auditors will inparticular&#13;
check that unit costs of inputs (energy, fuel, chemicals, parts...) chargedto AUWSSC are consistent with&#13;
internationalprices and that quantities are realistic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(Staff Appraisal Report for Kabul Water Supply and Sewerage Project), but its implementation was&#13;
stopped by the Soviet invasion of December 1979. Eventually, the project is expected to increasepiped&#13;
water coverage from the current 0.50 million people (or 14% of a total current population of 3.5 million in&#13;
2005) to a total o f 1.1 million people (or about 24% of a population of 4.5 million in 2010), of which 1.0&#13;
million through direct connections. Table 3 below summarizesthe articulation of the proposedproject&#13;
with the ongoing STP - supported by ARTF, KfW and USAID - and the secondphase of the MTP, for&#13;
which financing remains to be secured.&#13;

28. Logar ZZ Water Supply Scheme. The Logar I1scheme includes the development and equipment of a&#13;
well field inthe Logar aquifer located South of Kabul, the construction o f a transmission line to the main&#13;
reservoir E and the construction of distribution network in a part of the city that is currently not served by&#13;
CAWSS. IDA will finance the supply and laying of pipes for: (i)the collectors of the well field (11.7 km&#13;
pipes diameter 200 to 600 mm ductile cast iron -DCI); (ii)the transmission main (11.6 km diameter 800&#13;
mm DCI or steel); (iii)the extension of the distribution network (34 km pipes diameter 200 to 800 mm&#13;
DCI and 142 km pipes diameter 60 to 150 mm uPVC); and (iv) the construction of 15,000 new&#13;
connections, 60 public taps, 80 fire hydrants and the supply and installation of 16,000 meters.&#13;
&#13;
29. KfW, who will be financing the project in parallel, including drilling o f the boreholes, electric and&#13;
pumping equipment and reservoir E, have confirmed their level of commitment for US$11.6 million&#13;
equivalent for 2006-07 and US$12.9 million equivalent for 2007-08. When the ARTF financed project&#13;
was appraised, it was agreed that engineering consultants Beller (Germany) financed by KfW would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
responsible for the preparation o f the detailed designs, bidding documents, bid evaluation reports and for&#13;
construction supervision and commissioningo f works for all the water supply projects listed above&#13;
regardless o f the source o f financing. Beller are experienced engineering consultants with relevant&#13;
references, including on Bank financed WSS projects. Their terms o f reference (TOR) have been&#13;
reviewed and found satisfactory. It has been agreed that bidding documents for the IDA financed&#13;
contracts will be submitted to IDA for review not later than mid November 15, 2006. Contractors are&#13;
expected to mobilize early in July 2007 and construction to be completed by end 2009.&#13;
&#13;
30. Kabul Sanitation. IDA has funded strategic and feasibility studies for Kabul sanitation, covering&#13;
solid waste management, on-site sanitation, sewerage and drainage; documents are available in the project&#13;
files. Sanitation investments are not proposed to be addressed under this project as they are, or will be,&#13;
addressed under parallel projects (Annex I), focus on improving on-site sanitation services; 98% of&#13;
                                               which&#13;
the Kabul population relies on the latter, including in areas to be served by the project. These projects&#13;
comprise: (i)the ongoing ARTF-funded Short-Term Urban WSS project that finances investments&#13;
(including a new sanitary landfill and a septage disposal station) and technical assistance to the&#13;
Department o f Sanitation (DoS); (ii)the ongoing IDA-fundedKabul Urban Reconstruction Project&#13;
(KURP) that supports upgrading o f low-income areas; (iii)the proposed IDA-funded Urban Waste&#13;
Management Project (UWMP) that aims at improving the collection, transportation, processing and&#13;
disposal of municipal s,olid waste and residues from on site sanitation facilities, particularly inKabul; and&#13;
(iv) the proposed Carbon Finance Kabul Municipal and Domestic Waste Composting and Recycling&#13;
Project. The Urban Water Sector Project will however finance engineering designs for the first phase o f&#13;
wastewater investments in Kabul, to be financed under a subsequent project (para. 21).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.3.     Summary Project Cost&#13;
&#13;
3 1. The project will support the first phase o f the Government's Medium-Term Program valued at&#13;
US$64.5 million equivalent, including contingencies (Table 4 a). IDA will contribute US$40.0 million&#13;
towards this project cost and the German Development Agencies a total o f about US$24.5 million&#13;
equivalent. Table 4 b summarizes the base costs o f the three main project components to be financed by&#13;
the IDA Grant and the proposed contingencies. Physicalcontingencies have been assumed at 7.5% o f&#13;
base cost for TA, studies, training and financial support to operations and 10% o f base costs for&#13;
construction. Price contingencies have been calculated using an average 2.5% annual inflation rate. In&#13;
addition, tax contingencies have bee estimated at about 10% of the base cost. Altogether contingencies&#13;
represent about 20% o f the US$40 million IDA Grant.&#13;

      consultants and auditors will be selected according to either the "Quality and Cost-Based Selection"&#13;
      (QCBS) procedure or the "Selection on Consultants' Qualifications" (CQS) procedure.&#13;
      Training:Training institutions may be selected based following the CQS procedure or the Single&#13;
      Source Selection (SSS) basis.&#13;
     Procurement of Worksand Goods. Contracts for Goods above US$200,000 and Works above&#13;
      US$500,000 will be awarded according to the International Competitive Bidding(ICB) procedure.&#13;
      Contracts below these thresholds may be awarded according the Local Competitive Bidding (LCB)&#13;
      procedure. Goods valued at less than US$lOO,OOO may be procuredfollowing the Shopping&#13;
      procedure.&#13;
      Financial Support toAUWSSC Operations. Expenses to be reimbursed as part of the financial&#13;
      support to AUWSSC operations will not be subject to procurement guidelines. However, the&#13;
      selection o f AUWSSC management staff, whose salaries and bonuses will be financed by IDA trough&#13;
      this facility will follow a transparent and competitive procedure similar to the "Selection of Individual&#13;
      Consultants" procedure.&#13;
      Prior Review. All selection o f consultants following the QCBS procedure, all individual consultant&#13;
      contracts above US$50,000 and all consultant contacts awarded according to the SSS procedure will&#13;
      be subject to prior review by IDA. Annex 3 specifies review procedures for other selection o f&#13;
      consultants. All procurement o f Goods above US$200,000 and o f Works above US$500,000&#13;
      following the ICB procedure will be subject to prior review. Annex 3 also specifies review&#13;
      procedures for other Goods and Works contracts.&#13;
      ProcurementPlan. The draft final Procurement Plan was reviewed duringNegotiations and found&#13;
      satisfactory. The procurement plan will be updated annually or as required by the needs o f the project,&#13;
      DevelopingA UWSSCProcurement Capacity. An individual procurement specialist (to be financed&#13;
      by the ARTF funded WSS project) will be employed by CAWSS/MOUD for an initial period of six&#13;
      months prior to Grant Effectiveness to assist the Working Group formed by MOF and MOUDto&#13;
      corporatize CAWSS in their selection o f the four Advisors and the launching of the procurement&#13;
      activities for the Kabul water supply component. The Technical Advisor to AUWSSC General&#13;
      Manager is expected to have a strong procurement background and to develop AUWSSC&#13;
      procurement capacity. KfW-financed engineeringconsultants M/sBeller will be responsible for&#13;
      preparing the bidding documents for the works contracts financed by IDA, preparingbid evaluations&#13;
      reports, and finalizing contracts. As these procurement activities are scheduled to take place before&#13;
      AUWSSC i s fully effective, Beller will initially report to MOUD/CAWSS for these tasks.&#13;
      ProcurementAssessment. Despite the strengthening o f AUWSSC procurement capacity described&#13;
      above, the procurement risk i s rated as "high", in particular because AUWSSC is not yet created.&#13;
      IDA will carry out a close and regular procurement supervision o fthe project, inadditionto the two&#13;
      regular annual supervision missions.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
D.2. FinancialManagement,Disbursement,andAudit&#13;
&#13;
34. Financial management and disbursement arrangements (includingschedule andtimetable) are&#13;
detailed in Annex 4 and summarized below:&#13;
   A UWSSCFinancial Management Team. CAWSS financial managementcapacity under the ARTF&#13;
    financed project is weak. AUWSSC FinancialManager andthe Senior FinancialAdvisor are&#13;
    expectedto mobilize by end 2006 and early 2007 respectively. Ithas been agreedthat all accounting&#13;
    staff for AUWSSCiHQ and SBUs will be mobilizedby December 3 1,2007.Under existingFM&#13;
    arrangements (ARTF-UWSSfunded), FSOconsultants and counterpart Chief FinancialOfficer&#13;
    (CFO) at MOUD will continue to providesupport till the transition is complete and AUWSSC&#13;
    demonstrate an acceptable level of sustainabilityto manage its financialaffairs independently.&#13;
   AUWSSC Opening Balance Sheet. The Senior FinancialAdvisor will be in charge of: (i)finalizing&#13;
    AUWSSC openingbalance sheet, includingthe inventory of land, property andfixed/operatingassets&#13;
    (to define level of capitalization)as well as AUWSSC rightsand liabilities; and (ii)updatingthe&#13;
    financial analysis of AUWSSC operations basedon the new salary scale andthe three-year&#13;
    investment program, includingan estimationof workingcapitaland operatingsubsidies. Ithas been&#13;
    agreed that AUWSSC will submit to IDA for review a first reportpreparedby its auditors of its&#13;
    corporate financial statement not later than six months after the closingof its fiscal year endingon&#13;
    March21, 2008.&#13;
    Funds Witlzdrawals. AUWSSC will be a Budget Unit under the National BudgetFrameworkwith&#13;
    powers to withdraw hnds or requestpayments from MOF. The signing of a Disbursement Protocol&#13;
    betweenthe Treasury Department of MOF, MOUD andAUWSSC GeneralManager will be a&#13;
    condition of first disbursement. After Effectivenessand AUWSSC incorporation, AUWSSC will be&#13;
    able to seek funds, requestpayments for contractors, suppliers andconsultants, and obtainmonies&#13;
    basedon Cash Forecastssupported by Statement of Expenditures(SOEs) from the designated&#13;
    account, which will be under the control o fthe SpecialDisbursement Unit (SDU)ofthe Treasury.&#13;
    Oversightby FSO consultants will continue until the corporatizedAUWSSC has adequate FM&#13;
    systems and procedures in place.&#13;
    FinancialAssistance to AUWSSC. Financialsupport to AUWSSC operations will be providedon a&#13;
    basis similar to that of the ongoingFSOofthe presentARTF financedproject. Disbursementsunder&#13;
    this component will be made based on a calculationof a percentageof reasonableoperatingexpenses&#13;
    on a decliningbasis i.e. 45%, 30% and 15% for first, second andthird year respectivelyon a quarterly&#13;
    basis as an advance (para. 22). The subsequent quarterly advance will only be disbursed upon&#13;
    acquittalof the previousadvance and submission of any pre-agreed supportingSOEs or documents.&#13;
    The DisbursementProtocolbetween AUWSSC, MOUD andthe Treasury Department of MOF will&#13;
    outlinethe procedures for requestingthe advance and acquittal of the same thereof.&#13;
    Financial Management System. AUWSSC will establish adequateFinancialManagement Systems&#13;
    (FMS) to produce quarterly FinancialManagement Reports(FMRs) to IDA, pertainingto all sources&#13;
    and applicationof funds under the project. AUWSSC will undertake monthly and annual&#13;
    reconciliationsof expenditures with Treasury. A KfW financedTA, expected to start inthe third&#13;
    quarter of 2006, will support the Kabul SBU and streamline its operations and FM. AUWSSC will&#13;
    harmonizeFMS set up inthe three SBUs supported by KfW and GTZ with that established for&#13;
    AUWSSC/HQ andthe three other SBUs supported by the project. As part ofthe trainingprogram&#13;
    supported by the project, on-the-jobtrainingwill be providedto AUWSSC/HQ and SBU staff.&#13;
    Specific FMfunctions for which capacity needsto be built are listedbelow: (i)     accountingbasedon&#13;
    internationalstandards and compatiblewith the requirements of a WSS utility; (ii)formats for SBU&#13;
    financial statementsandreportingto HQ; (iii) data and forecasts for FMsuch as inventory, assets,&#13;
    debt and liquidity; (iv) financial Management Information System (MIS) includingmonitoringof&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    actual performance against targeted performance and budgets; (v) monitoring o f billing and&#13;
    collection; (vi) financial analysis, cost calculation and cost control; and (vii) monitoring o f O&amp;M&#13;
    expenses and service contracts.&#13;
&#13;
0   Audits. Accounting for IDA financed projects is centralized in the Treasury Department o f MOF,&#13;
    which is responsible for preparing annual financial statements and gettingthem audited by the newly&#13;
    created Internal Audit Department within MOF. It has been agreed that AUWSSC will appoint&#13;
    independent external auditors, with TORs acceptable to IDA, for auditing its corporate financial&#13;
    statements and claims for reimbursement under the Financial Support component not later than June&#13;
    30, 2007. The Government has committed to submit the TORs to IDA for review not later than&#13;
    August 15,2006.&#13;
&#13;
0   FMRisks. The FinancialManagement risk ratingfor the project is expected to be "high" for similar&#13;
    reasons as that exposed for the procurement function. As a risk mitigating measure it has beenagreed&#13;
    duringNegotiationsthat the FinancialManagement Consultants (ARTF-funded FSO at CAWSS,&#13;
    ARTF-funded counterpart CFO at MOUD,PPIAF-funded corporatization consultants) will continue&#13;
    to provide support until AUWSSC achieves an acceptable level o f sustainability in financial&#13;
    management activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.3. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
35, A comprehensive monitoring system tracking technical, commercial and financial indicators has been&#13;
put in place in CAWSS under the FSO component o f the ARTF-urban WSS project (see operational&#13;
manual and database in project files). Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) o f the performance o fthe urban&#13;
WSS sector will be carried out at two levels by MOUD and by AUWSSC (Annex 1l),              and will build&#13;
upon the systems established under FSO. It has beenagreed that M&amp;E arrangements will mostly track&#13;
the commercial, financial, commercial, and service performance (Annex 8) as described below and that&#13;
annual M&amp;E reports will be submitted not later than six months after the end o f the fiscal year, starting&#13;
with the fiscal year ending on March 21, 2007. AUWSSC will be responsible for data collection and will&#13;
report to its Board and to the MOUD(WSS Department)&#13;
    Commercialperformance per SBU (and other AUWSSC operations): (i)number o ftotal and billed&#13;
    connections: per category o f customer; (ii)population served and service ratio; (iii)   production, and&#13;
    sales (m3iyear); (iv) metering, billingand collection (m3/year and Afg); and (v) Non Revenue Water&#13;
    (YO).&#13;
    Financial Performance per SBU (and other AUWSSC operations and A U W S W H Q ) : (i)operating&#13;
    costs: electricity, fuel, chemicals, parts, maintenance (Afg); (ii)staff costs; salaries and bonus (Afg);&#13;
    (iii)managementcosts: salariesandbonus(Afg); (iv)revenuesperSBUpercategoryofcustomer&#13;
    (Afg); (v) accounts receivable per category o f customer (days o f billing); and (vi) Working Ratio (%).&#13;
    ServicePerformance per SBU/other operations: (i)per connection and per capita production and&#13;
    sales (liters per capita per day - lpcd); and (ii)percentage o f samples tested meeting residual chlorine&#13;
    standards (%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
E. PROJECTBENEFITSAND RISKS&#13;
&#13;
E.l.     ProjectBenefits&#13;
&#13;
36. EconomicAnalysis. A proper economic analysis o f the proposedproject shouldbe basedon the&#13;
assessed willingness to pay of customers, or the capital and O&amp;M costs of existingwater supply&#13;
arrangementsthat will be replacedby a well functioningpipedwater service. It shouldalso factor inthe&#13;
cost of externalities, such as the collectionand disposal o f incrementalquantitiesof waste water&#13;
generated, that would addto the projectcosts, and improvedpublic health, time savingand protectionof&#13;
the Kabul aquifers, that would addto its benefits. Since reliabledata are not available,the analysis&#13;
carried in Annex 2 for the extension ofthe Kabul water supply system is merely an estimate of ratiobased&#13;
on financial data. As part of this analysis, estimates ofthe Average IncrementalCost (AIC) o fwater,&#13;
FinancialInternalRate of Return(FIRR) and FinancialNet PresentValue (FNPV) have been carried out.&#13;
This analysis can be summarized as follows: (i) AIC: for a discount rate of lo%, the AIC is estimatingat&#13;
Afg 35/m3 (US$0.70/m3);this figure is rather high, but comparable with those that are estimated in, for&#13;
example, African countrieswhere the water supply service conditions are comparableto that of Kabul&#13;
(high capitalcosts, low consumption); (ii) Financial IRR: a FIRR of 5.6% has been estimated on the&#13;
basis of an average revenue per m3 collectedevolving from Afg 5/m3 in 2005 to Afg 1O/m3 in 2010 and&#13;
thereafter increasing at an average rate of 15%per year until it reachesAfg 35/m3 in 2020; and (iii)&#13;
FinancialNPV: basedon the above revenue stream, the FNPV would be negativeat minusAfg 1,430&#13;
million (US$28.6million) for a discountrate of lo%, with a switchingvalue for the discount rate at 5.6%.&#13;
&#13;
37. Least CostAnalysis.The design of the Logar I1scheme, and in particularthe elevationof the main&#13;
reservoir E (that is consistent with that of existingreservoirs), has been checked against the "least cost&#13;
solution" criteria. It has been concluded that the complexityof managing a distributionnetwork with&#13;
several pressurezones would offset potentialsavings o f only about US$20,000 per year on pumping&#13;
costs, However, a higher residualpressure in the distributionnetworkwill require implementationo f a&#13;
thorough leak management program; accordingly: (i)the new distributionnetworkto be developed under&#13;
the project is beingdesigned on this basis; and (ii) the TOR of the technical assistanceteam to the Kabul&#13;
SBU (to be financed by the German cooperation) havebeen complementedto reflectthis concern.&#13;
&#13;
38. SocialBenefits. While reliable willingnessto pay data are not yet available, several surveys carried&#13;
out in Kabulhave shown that access to pipedwater supply is consistentlyrankedamonghouseholds' top&#13;
preferences for development projects. A survey carriedout in 2003 by KfW inthe Taimani area where&#13;
the distributionsystem is proposedto be developed under the project, pipedwater supply is the first&#13;
priority for both male and female respondents(61% female and 48% male for water supply; vs. 17%&#13;
female and 28% male for power supply). Access to pipedwater supply is expectedto benefitmore&#13;
women and childrenwho play a major role incollectingand storingwater for domestic use. The cooking&#13;
and cleaning of the household are almost entirelyfemale chores across all wealthgroups, and so is child&#13;
care andtrainingof children in personal hygiene. Inaddition, the focus under this projecton makingthe&#13;
water providers technically and financially sustainablewill enable a faster expansion ofreliable and&#13;
affordable pipedwater services to the vast majoritywho are currently unconnected, either throughthe&#13;
expansion o fthe piped network, or through the provisionof temporary on-site services (e.g.water kiosks,&#13;
tanker service) drawing water from an expandedand more reliabletrunk system (Annex 6). Accordingto&#13;
several healthsurveys, the prevalence of water borne diseases in Kabul is amongthe highest inthe world;&#13;
the project is expected have a significant positive impacton this social aspect also.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39. Environmental Benefits. Recent groundwater studies, carriedout by the U S and Germanhydro-&#13;
geological surveys, have highlightedthe alarmingsituationofthe shallowaquifer underlyingKabulthat&#13;
i s usedby more than 75% the populationas the sole source of drinkingwater, includinginthe areas to be&#13;
served under the project. Groundwater levels are fast declining(minus 10meters in recent years) and&#13;
more wells are going dry every year. 70 % o f all wells are pollutedby fecal bacteria, andone quarter by&#13;
E.coli. 75% of shaft wells and 50% of pipedwater andwells with handpumps are pollutedby fecal&#13;
bacteria. Halfof all samples are above WHO limit for nitrate and all samples for borate; 85% of&#13;
groundwater is too hard. The deeper aquifers aroundKabulthat are usedby CAWSS are also under&#13;
threat from an uncontrolledurban development. The project is expectedto yield environmentalbenefits&#13;
by: (i) improvingCAWSS O&amp;M ,which should be translated in improvedquality of pipedwater&#13;
supplied; (ii) expandingthe distributionnetworkto provide a safe substitute to contaminated groundwater&#13;
in newly served areas; (iii) establishinga strict protectionof the Kabul mainaquifers; and(iv) preparinga&#13;
long-termstrategic planningfor allocating water among various users ofthe Kabulregionin an&#13;
environmentally sustainable manner. As indicatedin para.28, issues of solid and liquid waste&#13;
managementare addressedunder separatebut fully coordinated projects.&#13;
&#13;
E.2.Project Risks&#13;
&#13;
40. The design o f the proposedproject incorporatesthe lessons learned from on-goingIDA supported&#13;
projects in Afghanistan, particularlywith regardsto project implementation,procurement arrangements&#13;
and financial management arrangements. At the same time, the design of the component reflects&#13;
experiences from similar technicaldevelopments supported by other aid agencies. Nonetheless, there are&#13;
risks because of the uncertainsocio-economic and administrativesituationinAfghanistan. Table 5 below&#13;
summarizes the mainrisks andthe proposed mitigationmeasures.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
E.3.Alternatives Considered&#13;
&#13;
41. The original project design envisagedto link project processingto the mobilization of a private&#13;
operator for Kabul and other urban centers WSS operations. It was also based on the assumptionthat a&#13;
larger IDA allocation (US$SO million) would be available in FY07. Since MOF requested late in 2005&#13;
that the IDA allocation for the urban WSS sector be split intwo tranches, with a first tranche of US$40&#13;
million to be made available in FY06, the project objectives and components had to be slightly revised.&#13;
In particular, the mobilization of a private operator, if feasible, now becomes an objective of the project&#13;
(that could possibly be supported in a sub-sequent operation) rather than a pre-condition, and is replaced&#13;
by the strengthening of public operators with appropriate Management and Technical Assistance teams.&#13;
&#13;
42. The original project design also envisagedto include an on-site sanitation component. The latter has&#13;
been shifted to the Urban Waste Management Project under preparation (para. 28); this indeed simplifies&#13;
project implementation, as on-site sanitation i s under the responsibility of the Municipality of Kabul. The&#13;
investment component of the project had to be limitedto Kabul, mainly due to funding constraints.&#13;
However, from a program perspective, a reasonablebalance between Kabul and the Provinces has been&#13;
achieved until now, with 60% of the combined IDA and ARTF funding (including this project) invested&#13;
in Kabul, and 40% benefiting 14 Provincial centers (details in Annex 1). From the technical point of&#13;
view, the project proposes to develop the only source of water in Kabul that can be mobilized at a&#13;
reasonablecost: options for the long term that will be investigated under a separate project would require&#13;
longtransfers and significant pumping heads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES AND SAFEGUARDS&#13;
&#13;
43. EnvironmentalandSocia1 Management Framework. As a part of the socio-economic and&#13;
environmental assessments conducted during project preparation, an Environmental and Social&#13;
ManagementFramework (ESMF) has been developed for the project. The ESMF(see a summary in&#13;
Annex 5) builds upon the generic safeguardframework developed for emergency operations in&#13;
Afghanistan and used for all emergency operations, including the ongoing ARTF-financed Short-term&#13;
Urban WSS Project. The ESMF prescribes specific mitigation and enhancementmeasures to address the&#13;
social and environmental aspects of project interventions, which are reasonably well-defined. Inaddition,&#13;
the safeguards screening guidelines have beenprovidedfor possible subsequentvariations in project&#13;
interventions or possible additional investments.&#13;
&#13;
44. Environmental Assessment. Operational Policy 4.0 1"Environmental Assessment" is triggered,&#13;
Environmental impacts have been identified and addressed inthe EnvironmentalAssessments (EA) and&#13;
Environmental Management Plans (EMP) which were carried out as part of the feasibility studies for the&#13;
expansionof the Kabul water supply system (funded by KfW) and about 22 provincial towns (funded by&#13;
IDA and ARTF). Issues of wastewater disposal and treatment have beenanalyzed under the IDA-funded&#13;
Strategic Sanitation Plan and Sewerage/Drainage Master Plan for Kabul and the Sanitation Strategy for&#13;
provincial cities. They will be addressedunder the proposed FY07 Urban Waste Management Project&#13;
(for on-site sanitation) and a possible FY08/09 secondUrban Water Sector project (for sewerage), The&#13;
proposed project will improve existing arrangements for water treatment, water quality monitoring, and&#13;
importantly the establishment of groundwater protection zones to ensure sustainability of the resource,&#13;
Issues of security of access to bulk water, inter-sectoralwater allocation, conjunctive use of ground and&#13;
surface water are being addressedthrough the strategic study on long-term WSS issues for Kabul and&#13;
follow-up activities in Kabul and other regions (Annex 7).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
45. Groundwater Protection and Management Issues. A critical issue is to ensure sustainability of&#13;
Kabul's major aquifers, both for water quality and quantity, as they are by far the least expensive source&#13;
o f supply available. The EA has identified areas that needto be considered as part o f aquifer protection&#13;
zones, to minimize chances o f irreversible contamination. Enforcing zoning would be facilitated by&#13;
activities such as the demarcation o f aquifer protection zones, annual aquifer audits and informing siting&#13;
o f new development, to be supported by the proposed project (Annex 5). The Government has committed&#13;
to ensure that AUWSSC will: (i)submit to IDA for review a draft Groundwater Management and&#13;
ProtectionPlan o f Kabul major aquifers after consultation with key stakeholders not later than June 30,&#13;
2007; and (ii)cause the Kabul Municipality and the National Environment ProtectionAgency (NEPA) to&#13;
take action for implementation o f these recommendations, no later than December 31,2007.&#13;
&#13;
46. Water Resources Planning and Management. A recent study on "Scoping Strategic Options for&#13;
Kabul Water Supply: A Multi-Sectoral Decision Support System (DSS) Approach" i s available in the&#13;
project files (Annex 7). It highlights the need for multi-sectoral coordination for developing water&#13;
resources in the country and for creating an Inter-Ministerial Water Board and its Technical Secretariat to&#13;
undertake long-term water resources planning. The proposed project will support activities (Annex 2) to&#13;
support M O U D and the proposed Technical Secretariat to further refine and utilize the DSS already&#13;
developed for Upper Kabul River Basin, and to develop similar tools for other major cities (Mazar,&#13;
Kandahar, Jalalabad, Herat).&#13;
&#13;
47. SocialAssessment. Social assessments and socio-economic surveys were carried out under ongoing&#13;
WSS projects as part o fthe feasibility studies for WSS system expansion in Kabul (funded by KfW) and&#13;
about 20 provincial towns (funded by IDA and ARTF). In addition, a qualitative assessment o f past&#13;
experiences in community involvement in WSS in Kabul and other larger cities, e.g. by UN-Habitat,&#13;
should be carried out, along with a review o f the experiences among NGOs and UNagencies o f WSS-&#13;
related health-hygiene campaign. Particular attention will be paid to the potential for women's&#13;
&#13;
wss.&#13;
employment, e.g. as attendants at water kiosks or public toilets, as well as other jobs related to public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
48. LandAcquisition. Although no resettlement issues are expected, Operational Policy 4.12&#13;
"Inv01untary Resettlement" i s triggered as there will be a need for limited land acquisition, in particular&#13;
for each borehole o f the Logar well field (financed under ARTF-UWSS project), the main pumping&#13;
station and reservoir E. Furthermore, maintenance o f the right-of-way for the transmission line to&#13;
reservoir E is also critical as the alignment will cut across a hill which is rapidly turning into a residential&#13;
area. The status of the land involved is beingclarified and actions are being initiated to acquire the&#13;
requiredland, in compliance with the Land expropriation law and following the Environmental and Social&#13;
Management Framework's stipulations regardingcompensation for loss o f land and livelihood o f project&#13;
affected families in a consultative and mutually agreeable manner, compliant with OP 4.12, incase o f&#13;
both formal and informal settlements. The Government has committed to complete the process o f land&#13;
acquisition for the Project by June 30,2006, in accordance with the provisions o f the Project's&#13;
Environmentaland Social Management Framework.&#13;
&#13;
49. Beneficiary Surveys. It was agreed that a water supply and sanitation household survey will be&#13;
carried out in Kabul during the second half o f 2006, jointly with the energy consumption household&#13;
survey, with funding from a Bank Trust Fund. This survey should establish baseline data on the current&#13;
WSS situation, the willingness and ability to pay, current water use and sanitation practices and&#13;
awareness of their health-implications, and potential for consumer participation inplanning,&#13;
implementation and maintenance, in particular in areas to be served by public standposts. The survey will&#13;
inform tariff designand structure, consumer organizational issues and identify the need for health&#13;
education targeting women in particular. This activity will draw upon the social survey that was carried&#13;
out in 2003 under the KfW-financed feasibility study for the extension o f the water system. Several&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
workshops have already taken place to consult with stakeholders on the objectives and components o f the&#13;
project. Consultations at the community level will also take place before and during actual project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
50. Capacity Buildingfor Social and Environmental Management. Capacity for the management o f&#13;
social and environmental issues in the urban WSS sector will be built inMOUD and AUWSSC under the&#13;
project and also through an Environmental Institutional Development Project implementedby the newly&#13;
created National Environmental ProtectionAgency (NEPA). This project should establish fully&#13;
operational social and environmental management capacity within NEPA and line Ministries and&#13;
agencies, including M O U D and AUWSSC.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
&#13;
1,     World Bank (IDA) and ARTF support to the sector since 2002 have includedthe following:&#13;
&#13;
   0   Support to the Urban WSS emergency phase (2002-05), through the $15m UWSS component of&#13;
       the IDA-funded Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project (P077779)&#13;
       Support to the Government's Urban WSS short-term programme (2005-07), through the $41m&#13;
       ARTF Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project (PO92162)&#13;
&#13;
   0   Support to the Government's Urban WSS medium-term programme (2007-1l),           through the&#13;
           o   $40m IDA Urban Water Sector Project (P087860) for fiscal year 06, with a possible&#13;
               second project in FY08/09&#13;
           o   Proposed $20m IDA Urban Waste Management Project (P098461) for fiscal year 07&#13;
           o   ProposedKabul Waste Recycling and Cornposting (Carbon Finance) Project (P100133)&#13;

&#13;
UrbanWSS EmergencyPhase (2002-05):&#13;
UWSS component of IDA-funded Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project (EIRP)&#13;
&#13;
2.     This project included:&#13;
&#13;
    0  water supply rehabilitation works in provincial towns ($ 9.0 million) complementing investments&#13;
       financed by WHO, UN-Habitat, ICRC, UNOPS and feasibility studies for 22 provincialtowns&#13;
       (and 7 other towns financed by USAID);&#13;
       sanitation improvements in Kabul city with Emergency Solid Waste Collection (implemented by&#13;
       UN-Habitat in 2003-2004), priority and pilot investments in Solid Waste Management and On-&#13;
       site Sanitation systems ($1.5 million) and preparation of a Strategic Sanitation Plan and a&#13;
       Sewerage &amp; Drainage Master plan for Kabul city (final draft under review).&#13;
&#13;
3,     The main outcomes o f the provincial towns investment component include, subject to&#13;
confirmation during the implementation completionreview in mid-2006 (see details in Table 1below):&#13;
&#13;
    0  Preliminary data on the 11provincial towns indicates that the average coverage (number of&#13;
       householdconnections I number of households) has increasedfrom 16% (ranging from 0 to 52%)&#13;
       to 28% (ranging from 8% to 60%).&#13;
&#13;
    0  The overall production capacity raised from 15,000 to 25,000 m3/daywhich translates into an&#13;
       improvement of the average water availability from 6.5 lpcd (or 46 lpcd ifexpressedon the basis&#13;
       of population actually covered) to 10.5 Ipcd.&#13;
       Overall, it appears that there is still much room for improvement from a better managementof&#13;
       commercial operations with only 12,223 consumers formally registered to date comparedto the&#13;
       22,330 estimatednumber of household connections and an average pumping duration of 9.5&#13;

&#13;
   0    Social surveys, tariff studies, optionsfor services to thepoor, consultation and communication&#13;
        to provide a solid basis to future projects in Kabul and other cities, including options to serve the&#13;
        poor and informal settlements; customer surveys and willingness to pay assessments will be&#13;
        carried out as part o f consultation and communication process. These activities would&#13;
        complement the household survey to be carried out during2006 in Kabul (under separate Bank&#13;
        financing),   and the awareness campaigns in Kabul to be funded by K f W for which US$1.2&#13;
        million has been earmarked. Based on 6 man months o f international expert and a total o f 40 man&#13;
        months o f local staff, a budget o f US$0.25 million i s allocated for these activities.&#13;
&#13;

                  program under the Kabul Strategic Sanitation Plan, inclusive o f social and environmental&#13;
                  assessments.&#13;
&#13;
4. Audits. Based on a team including an international auditor (2 man month per audit) and four local&#13;
    auditors (16 man month per audit) the cost o f an audit should be an average o f US$125,000; based on&#13;
    semi-annual audits o f AUWSSC and each SBU accounts, the budget earmarked for this task is&#13;
   US$750,000.&#13;
&#13;
5,  Training. Training abroad will focus mostly on planning, project management, procurement,&#13;
    commercial management, accountingand financial management. The training program will be&#13;
    formulated by AUWSSC management team with the assistance o f the technical advisors. Based on&#13;
    about 200 participations to sessions in specialized training centers (50 in Europe, 150 in South Asia)&#13;
    and an average duration o f 15 days per session, a budget o f US$0.6 million is earmarked. Inaddition,&#13;

&#13;
                              Annex 2B: Financial Assistance to AUWSSC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. The "Financial Support to Operations - FSO" project financed by ARTF is now generating baseline&#13;
   data on the number o f billed connections, sales, production, operating costs and revenues for each o f&#13;
   CAWSS operations and headquarters. However these data are still based on a short period o f time&#13;
   (three to six months depending upon the operation) and cannot yet be considered as fully&#13;
   representative. Baseline data and assumptions are summarized in simplified cash flow forecasts&#13;
   available in the project files.&#13;
&#13;
2. Connections. The cash flow forecast provides the number o f billed connections for Kabul, Herat and&#13;
   the 12 other centers served by CAWSS; it is likely that a significant number o f unregistered&#13;
   connections exists, in particular in Kabul. The evolution o f the number o f connections is based on&#13;
   estimates carried out by projects for which financing has been secured for the 2005/2010 period.&#13;
   Between 2005 and 20 10, the total number o f AUWSSC billed connections is likely to evolve from&#13;
   91,500 to 151,500, corresponding to an additional population o f about 900,000. In Kabul,&#13;
   connections are likely to evolve from 33,000 to 70,000 corresponding to an additional served&#13;
   population o f about 555,000.&#13;
&#13;
3. Sales. Based on FSO figures, total sales in 2005 have been about 9.7 million, or 4.3, 3.6 and 1.8&#13;
   million m3 in Kabul, Herat and the other centers respectively. These figures translate in average sales&#13;
   per connection o f about 130, 160 and 50 m3/conn./year or 24,29 and 9 liters per capita per day (lpcd)&#13;
   for an average population o f 15 people per connection. While fairly low, these lpcd figures seem to&#13;
   be consistent with the widespread use o f groundwater by most connected customers and the limitation&#13;
   imposed by individual storage capacities needed to cope with a piped water service that is typically&#13;
   provided 12 hours every other day. For the coming five years, it has been assumed that the average&#13;
   consumption per connection would increase by lo%, 7.5% and 10% per year in Kabul, Herat, and&#13;
   other centers respectively, leading to average per capita sales o f 42, 46 and 16 lpcd in2010. Future&#13;
   sales are calculated by multiplyingthe above connection figures by the sales per connection.&#13;
   Between 2005 and 2010, AUWSSC sales are likely to increase from 9.7 million/m3/year to 25.4&#13;
   million m3/year; in Kabul, sales are likely to evolve from 4.3 to 14.7 million m3/year.&#13;
&#13;
4. Production and Non Revenue Water (NRW). Based on FSO figures, total production in2005 has&#13;
   been about 36.5 million m3, or 15.3, 6.6, 14.6 million m3 in Kabul, Herat and the other centers&#13;
   respectively. These figures translate in Non Revenue Water (NRW) o f 72%, 45% and 88% that are&#13;
   extremely high, even by South Asian standards. Setting NRW objectives depends upon several&#13;
   factors: (i)incentives SBUs and AUWSSC will have to improve collection; and (ii)the pace at which&#13;
   the distribution network and connections can be extended and commercial activities (meter reading,&#13;
   billing and collection) can be improved.&#13;
        0   For each SBU, the MOU with AUWSSUHQ will specify clear collection objectives;&#13;
            management staff o f the SBUs and AUWSSUHQ, who will be on fixed term contracts, will&#13;
            have a significant bonus (say 30% o f their salary) paid if objectives are achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   0   Kabul: an additional 800 km o f new distribution pipes should be added to the existing&#13;
       distribution network o f about 500 km, duringthe 10 years to come; assuming an average&#13;
       N R W of 20% for the new distribution networks and a gradual improvement to 50% for the&#13;
       existing distribution network, it would not be unrealistic to assume that NRW could reach&#13;
       30% in 2015. The cash flow forecast is based on an improvement o f NRW by 4 percentage&#13;
       points per year between 2006 and 2010; NRW objective for 2010 is set at 52%.&#13;
&#13;
   0   Herat and other centers: using similar reasoning, NRW objectives can be set at 39% and 58%&#13;
       respectively for 2010 (for average improvement o f 3 and 6 percentage points per year).&#13;
&#13;
   0   AUWSSC: as an average, NRW is proposedto evolve from an estimated 73% in 2005 to 52%&#13;
       in 2010. These are still extremely poor ratio by international standards.&#13;
&#13;
5. Operating Expenses. To simplify, the attached cash flow forecast considers only three main&#13;
   expenses:&#13;
&#13;
   0   Existing staff: the forecast is based on an annual increase o f the current expenditure o f Afg 55&#13;
       million per year (an average US$l,1OO/year per staff for a work force o f about 1,000 staff) by&#13;
       an average 17.5% per year to reflect staff increase and a gradual shift to a salary scale close to&#13;
       that o f the Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR), including a bonus system similar to the&#13;
       ongoing ARTF-financed FSO. Assuminga staffing ratio o f 10 per 1,000 connections, the&#13;
       entire AUWSSC operations could be run by a staff o f 1,450 in 2010; this would correspond to&#13;
       a total staff expenditure o f Afg 115 million/year for an average gross salary o f Afg&#13;
       80,00O/staff/year.&#13;
&#13;
   0   AUWSSC management sta8 the forecast is based on a team that includes one general&#13;
       manager (Afg 3.6 million/year, including bonus), one technical manager and one financial&#13;
       manager (Afg 2.70 milliodyear each) and seven regional managers (Afg 1,80 million/year&#13;
       each). The total compensation package is indicated above for the sole purpose o f preparing&#13;
       the cash flow forecast; it includes salary, benefits and bonus o f about 30% payable upon&#13;
       achievement o f performance; these figures are proposed to increase by 5% per year.&#13;
&#13;
   0   Energy, chemical and maintenance: FSO available figures, in particular that for energy, have&#13;
       to be used with precaution, even more so that the electricity tariff charged to CAWSS does&#13;
       not seem to be in line with international figures. Pendingclarifications by FSO, and technical&#13;
       audits of energy consumptions and expenses, the forecast i s based on an average cost o f Afg&#13;
       3/m3 produced and an average increase o f 7.5% per year.&#13;
&#13;
   0   Total O&amp;Mcosts: while production is assumed to increase by about 35% (from about 36.5 to&#13;
       about 50 million m3/year), O&amp;M costs are estimated to roughly double (from Afg. 165 to 300&#13;
       mi11iodyear).&#13;
&#13;
6. Revenues. AUWSSC operating expenses will be covered from user charges -that depend upon&#13;
   the average tariff and the collection ratio -and a decreasing complement to be providedby the&#13;
   project. The proposed short term cost recovery strategy is based on the following assumptions:&#13;
&#13;
   0   The average ratio of cash collection to O&amp;M expenses (Working ratio -WR) will gradually&#13;
       evolve form its current level o f about 30% to 100% in 2011;it will improve by about 15&#13;
       percentage points per year as o f 2007, Le., when AUWSSC new management team and TA&#13;
       are mobilized and the payment o f bonus for achievement o f agreed performance is possible.&#13;
       At the end of three-year project period, it is targeted to recover 75% o f O&amp;M costs from&#13;
       collection.&#13;
&#13;
   0   The project will contribute an agreed percentage o f "reasonable" O&amp;M expenses; this&#13;
       percentage will fixed to for a period o f 12 months, starting with 45% in 2007 and declining&#13;
       by 15 percentage points per year for the next two years; in 2008 and 2009, the project will&#13;
       thus contribute 30% and 15% o f O&amp;M costs. Contribution o f the project to AUWSSC O&amp;M&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         expenditures, broken down between O&amp;M and staff costs, management salaries and&#13;
         management bonus, will in addition be capped to the figures provided intable 1below, i.e., a&#13;
         total o f US$5.6 million for the three year period o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
     0   The average revenue from user charges per m3 o f water billed and collected is as a result&#13;
         expected to increase regularly from an average Afg 5/m3 in 2005 and 2006 to reach Afg&#13;
          10/m3 in 2009.&#13;

Sensitivity analysis. Because o f the paucity o f data, the above forecast is based on many&#13;
assumptions. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to identify impact on the average tariff that&#13;
needs to be reached in 2009;&#13;

&#13;
Introduction and Background&#13;
&#13;
1. Kabul Water Supply Situation. Estimates for the populationof Kabulvary from 3.0 to 3.5 million in&#13;
    2005, 4.0 to 5.0 million and 5.0 to 6.0 million in 2010 and 2015.&#13;
       About 0.5 million people currentlyhave access to CAWSS pipedwater supply that derives its&#13;
       water from the Logar, Upper Kabul (Allaudin) and Paghman(Afshar) well fields. CAWSS 500&#13;
       km distribution networkserves about 33,000 billed connections and about 600 standpipes; there is&#13;
       probablya large number of nonregistered or illegal connections. Based of the data generatedby&#13;
       FSO, the CAWSS systemproduces about 15 million m3/year (42,000 m3/day)but generates&#13;
       revenues only from the sale of 4.3 million m3/year. The Non Revenue Water (NRW) at 72% is&#13;
       extremelyhigh, even but South Asian standards. Water is typically delivered 12hours every&#13;
       other day, forcing households and businessesto store water. Based on FSO data, the average&#13;
       consumption is about 25 lpcd (130 m3 per connectionper year for an average populationof 15&#13;
        per connection) andthe average revenue is Afg 5/m3 (US$O.lO/m3) billed and collected. It is&#13;
       knownthat most customers with access to CAWSS pipedwater also use groundwater as&#13;
        secondary (or even sometimes primary) source of water.&#13;
       An additional0.15 million people living incollective housingmanagedby the MOUD&#13;
        (Macrorayon)are served by independent pipedsystems that rely on boreholestapping local&#13;
        aquifers. It is estimatedthat these systems produce about 3.8 millionm3/year (10,500 m3/day)&#13;
        on the basis of a 70 lpcd average consumption. The water bill is includedinthe rent.&#13;
&#13;
    0  The remaining2.35 to 2.85million people, of which about 1.0 million live in unplannedareas,&#13;
        rely mostly on wells taping shallow ground waters; basedon an average consumption of 15 lpcd,&#13;
        self supplies would represent a productionof about 36,000 m3/day (13 millionm3/year). The&#13;
       cost of construction of an open well is about Afg 50,000 (US$l,OOO). Operatinga poweredpump&#13;
       (electricity or diesel) costs about Afg l,OOO/month (US$20).&#13;
       The table below summarizes the Kabul current water supply situation; of course, these are rough&#13;
       estimates that will be clarified by appropriate surveys of actual consumptions, recurrent budgets,&#13;
       customer preferences andcustomer willingnessto pay to be carriedout in 2006.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
2. Kabul Sanitation Situation. As part o f the IDA-funded strategic and feasibility studies for Kabul&#13;
   sanitation (covering solid waste management, on-site sanitation, sewerage and drainage) an inventory&#13;
   o f existing facilities revealed that:&#13;
&#13;
   0    71% o f the Kabul area is served by dry toilet systems like vault toilets or pit latrines&#13;
&#13;
   0    27.5% o f the Kabul area is served by septic tank/cesspit systems&#13;
&#13;
   0    1.5% o f the Kabul area is connected to conventional sewerage systems&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation issues are not addressed under this project as they are (or will be addressed) under parallel&#13;
   projects:&#13;
&#13;
   0    The ongoing ARTF-funded Short-Term Urban Water Supply and Sanitation project that i s&#13;
        financing a new sanitary landfill and a septage disposal station (for disposal o f sludges from&#13;
        latrines and septic tanks);&#13;
&#13;
   0    The ongoing IDA-fundedKabul Urban ReconstructionProject that is supportingupgradingo f&#13;
        low-income areas, including on-plot water and sanitation;&#13;
&#13;
   0    The proposed IDA-fundedUrban Waste Management project that aims at improving the&#13;
        management (collection, transportation, processing and disposal) o f urban waste (municipal solid&#13;
        waste and residues from on site sanitation facilities) through institutional strengthening and&#13;
        selected investments in municipal solid waste and on-site sanitation in Kabul;&#13;
&#13;
   0    The proposed Carbon Finance Kabul Municipal and Domestic Waste Composting and Recycling&#13;
        project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Proposed Project&#13;
&#13;
   Objectives. The proposed project is based on a feasibility study financed by K f W and carried out in&#13;
   2003 by ajoint venture o f consultants led by Beller (Germany). The project aims at making full use&#13;
   o f the groundwater resources available in the Kabul area; this should result in an increase o f the&#13;
   installed production capacity from 42,000 to 120,000 m3/day (42 million m3/year). Such a&#13;
   production capacity should be sufficient to supply o f a total o f 103,000 individual connections (to be&#13;
   compared with the existing 33,000) requiringan extension o f the distribution network from 500 km to&#13;
   about 870 km. As a result, the project should result in an increase o f coverage from the current&#13;
   500,000 people to about 1.55 million people in 2015, or 30% o f the total population o f 5.0 million;&#13;
   out of this 1.55 million, about 1.10 million would have direct access to piped water through&#13;
   connections and about 0.45 million through public standpipes.&#13;
&#13;
   Phasing. The above objectives will be achieved intwo phases:&#13;
&#13;
   0    The first phase referred to as STP (short term program) is currently financedjointly by ARTF and&#13;
        KfWfor atotal o f US$25.6 million. Itaims at increasingthe production capacity from 42,000&#13;
        m3/day to 60,000 m3/day by rehabilitating and extending the Upper Kabul River (KBR) well&#13;
        field scheme including an additional 10 boreholes and associated pumpingequipment, main&#13;
        pumping stations, collectors and reservoirs and the distribution network by 132 km to reach an&#13;
        additional 11,000 customers. Construction for this scheme is scheduled to start in September&#13;
        2006 and to be completed by October 2007.&#13;
&#13;
   0    This first phase also includes the drilling o f 11 new boreholes inthe Logar I1aquifer to be&#13;
        equippedunder the second phase (MTP)&#13;
&#13;
   0    The second phase referred to as M T P (medium term program), to which the IDA Grant will&#13;
        contributejointly with KfW aims at increasing the production capacity from 60,000 m3/day to&#13;
        120,000 m3iday by developing the Logar I1well field scheme and extending the distribution&#13;
&#13;
                                                       33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        network by an additional 370 km to reach 42,000 new customers. Construction i s scheduled to&#13;
        start in 2006 and to be completed by 2010.&#13;
        The MTP is divided in two phases, to take into account available financing. The IDA Grant for&#13;
        fiscal year 2006 will contribute to MTP1.&#13;
&#13;
5 . The Logar Scheme&#13;
&#13;
    0   A n analysis of the Logar aquifer was carried out in 1978 by consultants Montreal Engineering&#13;
        Co. o f Canada. As part o f the project preparation, the quality o f water has been surveyed in a&#13;
        limited number o f shallow wells and found to be chemically acceptable, even if some high&#13;
        concentration o f nitrates was found in a small number o f wells; the water is not aggressive to&#13;
        concrete (reservoirs and piped lining).&#13;
&#13;
    0   The aquifer that is located at the outskirts o f the city has to be protected against accidental&#13;
        pollution (Annex 5)&#13;
&#13;
    0   The production/distribution scheme will be fully implemented between 2007 and 2010. The table&#13;
        in para. 9 below gives a summary description o f its main component, base cost as on mid2006&#13;
        (excluding physical, price and tax contingencies) as well as the available and needed financing&#13;
        sources.&#13;
&#13;
6. Project Readiness and Implementation Arrangement.&#13;
        Feasibility studies and detailed designs for all the components listed under the M T P 1 sub-project&#13;
        have already been prepared by consultants Beller o f Germany.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Ithas been agreed under the ARTF/KfW financed projectthat consultants Beller would be in&#13;
        charge o f the preparation o fthe biddingdocuments, the assistance to the procurement o f works&#13;
        and the construction supervision o f all works under MTP, regardless o fthe source o f financing.&#13;
        Beller is an experienced consulting firm with relevant references, in particular on several Bank&#13;
        and IDA financed water supply projects in other regions. Beller's TOR have been reviewedand&#13;
        found satisfactory; it has been agreed that the detailed staffing arrangement for construction&#13;
        supervision will be agreedjointly between IDA, KfW and Beller.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Beller will prepare the bidding documents for the IDA financed components by November, 2006.&#13;
        Basically IDA financed components will be broken into three (possibly four) packages:&#13;
              a.  Supply and laying o f pipes: collectors and transmission line (US$6.7 million);&#13;
              b. Supply and laying o f distribution pipes: two packages (US$6.0 and 5.8 million).&#13;
&#13;
7. Least CostSolution. The present design proposes to deliver all the Logar I1water to a reservoir E (to&#13;
    be built under the project) and located at elevation 1,860 meters above sea level (ASL). The two&#13;
    main reasons for this choice is that: (i)it is compatible with the elevation o f existing reservoirs and&#13;
   will thus limit the to one the number o f pressure zones; and (ii)it will allow a gravity supply o f&#13;
    reservoir H located about 7.6 km away at altitude 1,857 A S L (whose construction is not included in&#13;
   this project). During appraisal it was checked that the proposed scheme corresponds to the least cost&#13;
    solution. Indeed locating reservoir E at elevation 1,860 A S L (which is not really needed, since most&#13;
   o f the city is located at elevation 1,800 ASL and the type of housing- one to two stories -require a&#13;
   residual pressure at the connection point o f no more than 20 meters ) would result in an extra&#13;
   pumpingcost of about US$20,000/year accounting for higher pumpinghead and incremental volume&#13;
   o f physical leaks (a major concern in a city where NRW i s estimated to be above 50%). It was agreed&#13;
   that it would be simpler to distribute water under a single main pressure zone fed by reservoirs&#13;
    located at elevation 1,860 ASL and to implementa comprehensive leak management program based&#13;
   on: (i)for newly developed distribution networks: "district metering areas - DMA" serving 500 to&#13;
    1,000 connections connected to highpressure mains through a proper pressure reduction device and a&#13;
   bulk meter; and (ii)for existing networks: a gradual testing and replacement o f connections (where&#13;
   typically 70% of physical leaks take place) and small diameter distribution pipes. Focus on leak&#13;
&#13;
                                                      34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   management will be reflected inthe detailed design of the new distribution networks and the TORSof&#13;
  the technical assistance(to be finance by the German assistance) to Kabul SBU. Optimization ofthe&#13;
   design of the reservoir Eto H7.6 km transmission line will be carried out prior to its design.&#13;
&#13;
8.Project Economic Analysis. An economic analysis of the proposedproject should be based on&#13;
  willingness to pay of customers (or the cost of substitutes to piped water) as well as on the cost of&#13;
   externalities, such as the collection and disposal of incremental quantities of waste water generated,&#13;
   that would add to the project costs, and improvedpublic health, time saving and protection of the&#13;
   Kabul aquifers, that would add to its benefits. Since reliable data is not yet available, the following&#13;
   analysis is merely an estimate of ratio based on financial data.&#13;
&#13;
9. Project Financial Analysis. As part of this analysis, tentative estimates of the Average Incremental&#13;
   Cost (AIC) o f water, Financial Internal Rate of Return(IRR) and Net PresentValue (NPV) have been&#13;
   carried out. They will be updated and revised, based in particular on the FSO data for the third&#13;
   quarter for Kabul operations, expected by the end of March 2006. This analysis can be summarized as&#13;
   follows.&#13;
       Assumptions:&#13;
           a.   Calculation carried out for a 25 year period (2006 to 2030);&#13;
           b. Investment program between 2006 and 2012: Afg 4,650 million (US$93 million);&#13;
           c.   Connections served: increasing from 33,000 in 2005 to 103,000 in 2015 and remaining at&#13;
                103,000 thereafter;&#13;
           d. Average consumption per connection: increasing from 130 m3/year (25 lpcd) in 2005 to&#13;
                275 m3/year (50 Ipcd) in 2017 and remainingat 275 m3/year/connection thereafter;&#13;
           e.   NRW: decreasingby 4 percentage point per year from 72% in 2005 to reach 30% in 2016&#13;
                and remaining at 30% thereafter;&#13;
           f. Staffcosts: increasing from Afg 30 millionin2005 to Afg 92 millionin2013; remaining&#13;
                at Afg 92 million after 2013;&#13;
           g. Energy, chemicals: estimated at Afg 3/m3 produced throughout the calculationperiod;&#13;
           h. Maintenance: 1% of the value of assets in operation.&#13;
&#13;
   0   AZC: for a discount rate of lo%, the AIC is estimating at Afg 35/m3 (US$0.70/m3); this figure is&#13;
       rather high, but comparable with those that are estimated in African countries, for example, where&#13;
       the water supply service conditions are comparable to that of Afghanistan (high capital costs, low&#13;
       consumption). The AIC would evolve from Afg 3l/m3 to Afg 39.5/m3 for discount rate of 8%&#13;
       and 12%.&#13;
&#13;
   0   FinancialZRR: the financial IRR has been estimated on the basis of an average revenue per m3&#13;
       collected evolving from Afg 5/m3 in 2005 to Afg 1O/m3 in 2010 and thereafter increasing at an&#13;
       average rate of 15% per year until it reaches Afg 35/m3 in 2020. Under these conditions, the&#13;
       FIRR is only about 5.6%.&#13;
&#13;
   0   FinancialNPV: based on the above revenue stream, the project financial NPV is negative at&#13;
       minus Afg 1,430 million (US$28.6 million) for a discount rate of 10%. The financial NPV would&#13;
       be positive for discount rate below 5.6%.&#13;

&#13;
                                 Annex 3: Procurementarrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.       COUNTRY CONTEXT&#13;
&#13;
1.       IDA has gained substantial experience and understandingofthe procurement environment in&#13;
Afghanistanthrough its involvementinthe interimprocurementarrangements put inplacethroughthe&#13;
EmergencyPublic AdministrationProject(EPAP) as well as with the institutionswith current&#13;
responsibilityfor those andthe subsequent arrangements, namely ARDS. As part ofthe broader review&#13;
o f Afghanistan's Public Finance Management (PFM) system, IDA carriedout an assessmentof the&#13;
procurement environment in the country basedonthe baseline and performance indicatorsdevelopedby a&#13;
group of institutions led by the World Bank and OECD's DevelopmentAssistance Committee (DAC).&#13;
&#13;
2.       The first key issue identifiedthroughthe procurement assessment is the need for ownership and a&#13;
champion in the Government for reformdeepeningof capacity, ensuring integrity in the operation of&#13;
procurement systems, and promoting sound procurement among ministries. A second, related issue is the&#13;
lack of capacity inthe line Ministries, as evidencedby their inability to define andcommunicate&#13;
effectively their desired technical specificationsin their procurements.The lack of capacity is also evident&#13;
in the local private sector: while the number of bids is reasonably high, there is a lack of understandingon&#13;
applicationof public procurement rules.&#13;
&#13;
3.       A new Procurement Law has been adopted inNovember 2005 which radicallytransforms the&#13;
legal and regulatoryframework. While it provides a very modern legalsystem for procurement, it may be&#13;
difficult to implement in the current context.It relies, for example, on the establishment of a procurement&#13;
policy unit to ensure implementationthroughthe creationof secondary legislation, standard bidding&#13;
documents, provision of advice and creation of the necessary informationsystems for advertisingand data&#13;
collection.It further relies on the development of an independent complaintsreview mechanismto ensure&#13;
enforcement.Neither is yet in place.&#13;
&#13;
4.       In absenceof adequate capacity to manageprocurement activities effectively, a central&#13;
procurement facilitation service has beenestablished. IDA and the Government have agreed on a&#13;
programfor countrywide procurement reformand capacity building, leadingto the transitionfrom&#13;
centralized to decentralized procurement services. The IDA fundedPublic AdministrationCapacity&#13;
Building project(PACBP) is the primary instrument for implementingthe programto strengthen capacity&#13;
of the line ministriesto manage public procurement in an effective,transparent and accountable manner.&#13;
However, the implementationof the procurement capacity building strategy has not made any significant&#13;
progressyet due to lack of coordinationand delays in decisionmakingwithin the Government. The&#13;
radicalchangesto the procurement environmentbroughtabout by the new Law also requirethe urgent&#13;
implementationof a comprehensive capacity development program. The implementationof the&#13;
procurement reformcomponent ofthe PACBP should be considered with due priority to ensurethat&#13;
fiduciary standards are further enhanced and that capacity is developed inthe Government to maintain&#13;
these standards.&#13;
&#13;
B.       GENERAL&#13;
&#13;
5.       Procurement for the proposed project will be carriedout in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" datedMay 2004, and "Guidelines:&#13;
Selectionand Employmentof Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, andthe&#13;
provisionsstipulated inthe FinancingAgreement. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents, Requestsfor&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
conversantwith Bank procurement procedures. Itwill not be possible for CAWWAUWSSC to handle&#13;
directly large procurementsunder the project.The following mitigationmeasureshave been agreed:&#13;

     0   Orientation and capacity building of staff on Bank procurementprocedures as part of the training&#13;
         program.&#13;
&#13;
13.      TransitionalArrangements. N o contract negotiationand signature is expectedto take place prior&#13;
to Grant effectiveness and incorporationof AUWSSC.No retro-activefinancing is envisagedunder the&#13;
project.However, as procurement steps will be initiatedpriorto Grant effectiveness (in which case the&#13;
provisionsfor Advance Contractingmay apply) incorporationof AUWSSC, it has been agreedthat: (i)&#13;
CAWSS, on behalfof MUDH,will initiatethe procurement ofworks with the support ofthe engineering&#13;
consultants Beller; (ii) the Working Group formedby MOF andMOUD to prepare AUWSSC&#13;
incorporation,actingas temporary Boardof Directorswill initiatethe selectionof advisors with the&#13;

                          Annex 4: FinancialManagementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
Country Issues&#13;
&#13;
1.       IDA has gained substantial experience and understanding of the financial management&#13;
environment in Afghanistan throughthe large number o f projects under implementationover the past four&#13;
years. The Public AdministrationCapacity Building project,PACB, is the primary instrumentto continue&#13;
and enhancethe fiduciary measuresput in place duringthe pastyears to help ensure transparency and&#13;
accountability for the funding providedby IDA and other donors.&#13;
&#13;
2.       A Public FinancialManagement (PFM) performance ratingsystem using28 high-levelindicators&#13;
that was developedby the Public Expenditureand FinancialAccountability(PEFA) multi-agency&#13;
partnership programwas applied inAfghanistaninJune 2005. The system is structured around six core&#13;
dimensions of PFM performance: (i)budget credibility, (ii)comprehensiveness andtransparency, (iii)&#13;
policy-basedbudgeting, (iv) predictabilityand control in budget execution, (v) accounting, recording, and&#13;
reporting,and (vi) externalscrutiny and audit. Afghanistan'sratings against the PFM performance&#13;
indicatorsgenerallyportray a public sector where financial resources are, by and large, beingusedfor&#13;
their intendedpurposes. This has been accomplishedwith very high levels of support from international&#13;
firms. This assistance will continueto be neeaed in the mediumterm ifthese ratings are to be&#13;
maintained. There is also much room for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
3 ,      In spite of undeniable gains made in reconstructionsince the end of 2001, the challenges facing&#13;
Afghanistanremain immense; not least because of the tenuous securitysituationin the regionand&#13;
continuedprevalence of a large illegal and illicit economy. The policy framework benchmarkshave not&#13;
yet beencosted so various priorities are funded throughthe annual budgetingprocess. The rising costs o f&#13;
the security sector constitutethe major constraint on attainment of fiscal sustainability.The national&#13;
assembly will play an increasingly active role with regardto executive oversight.The nationalstrategy&#13;
has createdhigh expectations of the executive which couldprove to be quite difficult to meet.&#13;
&#13;
4.       The public sector, in spite of considerableefforts to reform its core functions, remains extremely&#13;
weak outside o f Kabul. The lack of qualifiedstaff inthe civil service andthe absence of qualified&#13;
counterparts in the government after 30 years or war and conflicts is abinding constraint.Delays in&#13;
reformingthe pay structure and gradingo f civil servants have severely crippledthe public administration&#13;
of the country.Domesticrevenues lagbehindexpendituresby a factor oftento one. Large-scale&#13;
corruptioncould emergeto undermine the government's efforts to enhance aid flows throughnational&#13;
accounts. Capacities to track expenditures and monitor expenditure outcomes have improved, butthey&#13;
needrapidand substantial strengthening ifprogresstowardthe attainment of nationaldevelopment targets&#13;
is to be monitored. Currently, 75% of externalrevenues bypass government appropriationsystems.&#13;
&#13;
5.       IDA is financing a Financial ManagementAdvisor to assist the Ministry of Finance, an Audit&#13;
Advisor to assist the Control and Audit Office, and a ProcurementAdvisor to assist inProcurement-&#13;
related activities.Also an InternalAudit Functionis beingdeveloped inthe country with IDA financing.&#13;
USAID and earlier the IndianAid Assistance Programmeare also financinga team of consultantsand&#13;
advisors to assist the Da Afghanistan Bank in local as well as foreign currencyoperations. The activities&#13;
carried out under the existing Public Administrationprojectshave helpedthe Government to ensurethat&#13;
appropriate fiduciary standards are maintainedfor public expenditures, includingthose supportedby IDA&#13;
andthe donor community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                     46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.      Progress has been slower than expected inshiftingfrom operations support providedby the&#13;
Advisors to capacity development and knowledgetransfer to the civil servants.Giventhat, the use ofthe&#13;
Advisors is expectedto continue to be requiredfor the mediumterm. Challenges still remainin attaining&#13;
the agreed upon fiduciary standards and also to further enhancethem. And inthe interim, the regulatory&#13;
environment inAfghanistan has advanced significantly. Unfortunatelyeventhe mastery of basic skills in&#13;
the early environmentdoes not fully qualify the civil servants to work effectively inthe new emerging&#13;
environment.&#13;

Management matters o fthe project.&#13;

 Strengthsand Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
 Strengths&#13;
&#13;
 9.       The main strength is the Government'scommitmentto the PACB project's approachto ensure&#13;
 that capacity is in place to strengthen accountabilityandtransparency in its operations. PACB helps to&#13;
                                                                                         .&#13;
 strengthen the: financialmanagement in Treasury operations, internalaudit, public procurement, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
external audit under the Auditor General. This helps to provide assurance to IDA and other donors that&#13;
the current measures designed to ensure appropriate utilization o f funds will not be circumvented&#13;
&#13;
10.      The MOUDand CAWSS (an existing semi autonomous unit under MOUD) have initiated&#13;
reforms o f the ministry's administrative and financial functions. Appointment o f counterpart CFO has&#13;
been requested by MOUD,which will bring the required support to implementthe reforms and improve&#13;
management o f the development budget. CAWSS is expected to be "corporatized" with assistance o f&#13;
consultants financed by PPIAF (under contract with the Bank). A working group will be formed by M O F&#13;
and M O U D to interact with these consultants. Similar arrangements for oversight on the monitoring o f&#13;
expenditures will be in place which i s provided by FSO consultants currently and will be supported by&#13;
individual consultant/s under the new project to build capacity in SBUs. However, continued support&#13;
from FSO will be critical until AUWSSC demonstrates sustainability in financial management activities&#13;
across SBUs and HQat Kabul. Appointment o f staff based on the corporatization consultants (PPIAF-&#13;
funded) recommendations at market rates (with performance bonus) including Finance ManagerKFO and&#13;
accounting staff at Head quarters and SBUs together with appointment o f Sr Financial Advisor and&#13;
extensive training to the staff o f the newly formed corporate entity and strategic business units will be a&#13;
major strength. CFO-MOUD and corporatization consultants will remain actively involved inthe&#13;
operations o f AUWSSC till Finance Manager and the Sr. Financial Advisor completely take over the&#13;
financial matters o f the new entity.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Inaddition, KfW will also finance a technical assistance to the Kabul and two other SBU&#13;
operations. This TA, to be provided by a consultant and an international water operator, is scheduled to&#13;
mobilize during the third quarter o f 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
12.      The main weakness in this project, as in many others in Afghanistan, is the ability to attract&#13;
suitably qualified and experienced counterpart staff at governmental pay scales. Lack o f capacity in the&#13;
civil service has cased continued reliance on international firms to perform core government functions.&#13;
&#13;
13.      CAWSS does not have the required capacity to manage foreign grants and its FM systems and&#13;
staff lacks the capacity to deal effectively with donor agencies. It is presently being supported by a&#13;
consulting firm under the ARTF -UWSS for the financial support operations. However, to address this&#13;
weakness, appointment o f staff based on the consultants (PPIAF) recommendations at market rates (with&#13;
performance bonus) including Finance ManagerICFO and accounting staff at Head Quarters and SBUs&#13;
together with appointment o f Sr Financial Advisor and extensive training to the staff o f the newly formed&#13;
corporate entity and strategic business units will overcome this weakness.&#13;
&#13;
Implementing Entity&#13;
&#13;
14.     AUWSSC (corporatized CAWSS) will be the implementing agency for this Project. It will be a&#13;
budget unit under the National Developmental Budget Framework with powers to request payments&#13;
under the project. CAWSS (an existing semi autonomous unit under MOUD) is expected to be&#13;
corporatized with assistance from a team o f experts funded under PPIAF. This team o f expert will also&#13;
include a Financial Management Specialist (FMS) who will advise on structuring o f the new entity with&#13;
respect to the Financial Management functions. The FMS scope will include Inventory o f land, property&#13;
and fixedioperating asset to define level o f capitalization; financial analysis o f CAWSS operations and&#13;
extrapolation based on new salary scale and a 3-year investment programme for the definition o f&#13;
working capital and operating subsidies; Inventory o f rights and liabilities, including financial&#13;
obligations, to finalize the opening balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
15.     Sincethis project will be the first donor project inwhich AUWSSC will take full responsibility&#13;
for implementation,very little capacity exists in managingdevelopment budget within the existing&#13;
CAWSS.To strengthenthe FMcapacity of CAWSS before it is corporatized, a soonto be hiredCCFO&#13;
for MOUD will providebudget and financial management support.Initially the above mentionedworking&#13;
group with assistancefrom CCFO along with the Counterpart in the PlanningDepartmentof MOUD will&#13;
be responsible for ensuringthat the Projectexpenditures envisagedto be expended in a fiscal year are&#13;
captured in the Governmental Developmentbudget of that fiscal year andthat the budget is allottedto&#13;
AUWSSC as an implementingagency. It is to be ensuredthat the project is includedinthe budget decree;&#13;
however, in case it has not been included,AUWSSC must get an approvalfrom the presidentialoffice to&#13;
be attachedto D1forms at the time of requesting yearly allotments for contracts under development&#13;
projectto avoid delays when payments are processed.Uponcorporatizationthis function will bethe&#13;
responsibilityof AUWSSC.&#13;
&#13;
16.     For the first few quarters (depending on the needby AUWSSC), FSO consultants will assist the&#13;
Accountants at SBU to coordinatewith FinanceManager and Sr FinancialAdvisor and individual&#13;
consultants to prepare quarterly budgetsto be consolidated into the annual development budget for&#13;
AUWSSC.&#13;
&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
&#13;
17.     The flow o f funds will be similar to previousprojects except that all receipts from MOF will be&#13;
deposited inthe Bank account ofthe AUWSSC. Projectfunds from IDA will be deposited inthe&#13;
DesignatedAccount (DA) to be opened andmaintainedat the DaAfghanistan Bank (DAB) or ina local&#13;
commercialbank. Capacity in terms of delivery of service and charges for the services will haveto be&#13;
assessed by the Government (MOF) and arrangements formalizedbefore movingfrom the existing&#13;
practice of placingthis account in Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB). The DA, in keepingwith current&#13;
practices for other projects in Afghanistan, will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) in&#13;
the Treasury Department of Ministry of Finance. Requestsfor payments out of DA funds will be madeto&#13;
the SDU by AUWSSC.&#13;
&#13;
18.     A DisbursementProtocolbetweenAUWSSC, MOUD and MOF-Treasurywill be signed&#13;
outliningthe procedures, rules and regulationsfor requesting funds and/or paymentdadvance from MOF&#13;
and specificallyoutlining procedures, controls and reportingas relatedto Component 2 (Financial&#13;
Support).. Signingof this disbursement protocol is a conditionof disbursement for the Grant.&#13;
&#13;
19.     The Bank's FMUnit alongwith MOF and AUWSSC officials will reviewthis arrangement at the&#13;
first supervision missionwith a view to carry out an FM assessmentofthe capacity of the corporateentity&#13;
in terms of managingfunds. On a satisfactoryratingof such assessment, the possibility of fund flows&#13;
directlyto the corporate entity's bank account will be discussed and arrangementsand disbursement&#13;
protocols and the Disbursement Letter amendedaccordingly.&#13;
&#13;
20.     In additionto payments out o f DA funds, the implementingentities could also requestthe SDUto&#13;
makedirect paymentsto suppliers, consultants or consultingfirms, and issue special commitments for&#13;
importcontracts for goods covered by lettersof credit. Such requestswill follow the World Bank&#13;
procedures.Project payments that are expectedto be madeto either internationalfirms or local firms, will&#13;
made either through bank transfers into the account of such firms or, ifnecessary, by way o f check&#13;
payment with account details written on the check.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Working CapitaVO&amp;M Expenditure Component&#13;
&#13;
21.      For simplification purposes, expenditures will be clubbed into categories depending on the chart&#13;
o f accounts being followed by CAWSS for reporting purposes. Disbursements underthis component will&#13;
be made based on a calculation o f a percentage o f "reasonable" operating expenses on a declining basis&#13;
i.e. 45%, 30% and 15% for first, second and third year respectively on a quarterly basis as an advance.&#13;
The subsequent quarterly advance will only be disbursedupon acquittal o fthe previous advance and&#13;
submission o f pre-agreed supporting documents. Disbursement Protocol between AUWSSC and MOF-&#13;
Treasury will outline the procedures for requesting the advance and acquittal o f the same thereof.&#13;
&#13;
Legal requirementsfor authorized signatures&#13;
&#13;
22.      Specimen signatures o f authorized signatories in corporatized AUWSSC for purposes o f signing&#13;
M16 forms will be approved by the Minister o f Finance and to be submittedto IDA prior to commencing&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedure&#13;
&#13;
23.      Under the on-going ARTF-UWSS project, FSO consultants along with the finance staff at&#13;
CAWSS HQand branches supervise preparation o f supporting documents for operating expenditures&#13;
which forms the supporting documentation for payment request or M 1 6 from MOUD to SDU. Under the&#13;
new project, this will still be supported by FSO Consultants until adequate external technical assistance is&#13;
in place. AUWSSC Management will have the authority to signpayment orders (Form M16) for onward&#13;
submission to the Treasury Department in MOF which in turn will issue a check payable to the cash&#13;
trustee by DAB after verification o f supporting documents and approvals on the form.&#13;
&#13;
24.      Financial Management Manual has already been prepared for CAWSS operations by FSO&#13;
consultants under the ARTF - UWSS project (see project files). This will be updated with changes&#13;
envisaged based on PPIAF consultants team recommendations. The revised financial management manual&#13;
i s expected to include guidelines based on best practices and international standards to maintain financial&#13;
data under AUWSSC resulting in annual Financial Statements. The revised FM manual will particularly&#13;
include arrangements in terms o f : (i)internal control systems and procedures to ensure that AUWSSC&#13;
can be self sufficient and successful in managing its affairs towards becoming a profitable venture; (ii)&#13;
adequate corporate governance structure in place with roles and responsibilities o f key FM staff in the&#13;
management team o f the new entity (job descriptions to be included); and (iii)role o f various FM&#13;
consultants/advisors within CAWSS and their responsibilities continuing in the corporatized AUWSSC&#13;
and finally handover to AUWSSC management team until a sustainable structure i s in place.&#13;
&#13;
25,     Finance Manager with the support o f Financial Advisor, CFO (MOUD), Corporatization&#13;
consultants and local staff will establish project financial management in accordance with international&#13;
standards. For each fiscal year, AUWSSC Finance Manager will be responsible for the preparation o f&#13;
Financial Statements following international accounting standards duly audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Currently, all financial data pertaining to CAWSS operations i s maintained by FSO consultants&#13;
with the help o f regional local staff in Access Database. Reporting o f financial data has improved and&#13;
achieved some reliability in the past few months. FSO and KfW/GTZ are discussing the option o f using a&#13;
more sophisticatedyet manageable software which is user friendly and cost effective. The decision will&#13;
be taken in coming months; till then, the existing arrangements will continue to be followed by FSO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27.     Civil works will be outsourced by means of a large contract. Similar FMarrangements will be&#13;
applied interms o f preparation of M-16 forms by the implementingagency and paymentsthroughMOF-&#13;
SDU.&#13;
&#13;
28.     The project will follow standard governmental financial managementpolicies and procedures. It&#13;
will use the Chart o f Accounts which has been developed for previous projects and which is currently&#13;
being upgraded. Ultimately the SDU will be responsible for accounting for all expenditures and receipts&#13;
in the Government's accountingsystem.&#13;
&#13;
29.     The Finance Department in AUWSSC will be responsible for coordinationwith the SDU. Project&#13;
accounts will be consolidatedcentrally in the Ministry of Finance, throughthe Special DisbursementUnit&#13;
in the Treasury supported by financial managementagent. Consolidated ProjectFinancialStatements will&#13;
be preparedfor all sources and uses of projectfunds.&#13;
&#13;
Harmonization with Donors&#13;
&#13;
30.     A TA funded by KFW/GTZ is envisaged to start in the third quarter of 2006 which will support&#13;
Kabul SBU (to include Herat and KundudTaluqan subsequently) to streamline operations including&#13;
financial management. It has been agreed that other three SBUs of AUWSSC will work towards&#13;
streamliningtheir operations replicatingbest practices introducedin Kabul SBU.&#13;
&#13;
3 1.    Individual consultants will ensure that on-the-jobtraining is impartedto staff in SBUs to have a&#13;
uniform system in place across the six AUWSSC SBUs and the HQ.Specific areas in terms of financial&#13;
management where capacity will be built include; a) financial analysis, cost calculation and controlling;&#13;
b) setting up of an accounting system according to international standards and compatible with the&#13;
requirements o f a water utility; c) standard formats for financial statements and reporting to HQand&#13;
initial preparation of data and forecasts for financial management (notably with respect to inventory,&#13;
asset, debt and liquidity management); d) establishment of a financial MIS includingmonitoringof actual&#13;
performance against targeted performance and budgetskinancia1 plans; e) Financial monitoring (billing,&#13;
collection, accounting) and; f) monitoringof O&amp;M and other service contracts.&#13;
&#13;
Internal Audit&#13;
&#13;
32.     The project financial management systems will be subject to review by the newly established&#13;
internal audit directorate of the MoF, accordingto programs to be determined by the Director of Internal&#13;
Audit. Additionally, an internal audit department will be established within AUWSSC which will ensure&#13;
that adequate internal controls are in placewithin HQand SBUs.&#13;
&#13;
33.     Under the existing ARTF - UWSS project, FSO consultantsjust finished the first informal audit&#13;
which will be repeated every quarter.The findings are being discussed and mitigating measuresare being&#13;
put in place.This practiceis envisaged to be taken over by the internalaudit department of AUWSSC.&#13;
&#13;
External Audit&#13;
&#13;
34.     External Audit scope has been enhanced for this project. The accounts of the project will be&#13;
audited by the Auditor General, with the support of the Audit Agent, with terms of reference satisfactory&#13;
to the Association. The audit of the project accounts will include an assessment of the: (a) adequacy o f&#13;
the accounting and internal control systems; (b)        ability to maintain adequate documentation for&#13;
transactions; and (c) eligibility of incurred expenditures for Association financing. The audited annual&#13;
project financial statements will be submitted within 6 months of the close of fiscal year. All agencies&#13;

&#13;
          Annex 5: Summary of the Social and EnvironmentalSafeguards Framework&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
1.        An environmental and social management framework (ESMF) has been developed for the project&#13;
to effectively address environmental and social opportunities and concerns. A framework approach has&#13;
been chosen because, although project interventions have been well-defined, there are uncertainties given&#13;
the overall post-conflict operational context in Afghanistan, which requires substantial flexibility during&#13;
implementation. The ESMF builds upon the generic safeguard framework developed for emergency&#13;
operations in Afghanistan and used for all emergency operations. The ESMF prescribes specific&#13;
mitigation and enhancement measures to address the social and environmental aspects o f project&#13;
interventions. In addition, safeguards screening guidelines have been provided for possible subsequent&#13;
variations in project interventions or possible additional investments.&#13;
&#13;
Safeguard issues and applicability of Bank policies&#13;
&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
2.        Operational Policy 4.01 "Environmental Assessment" is triggered. Environmental impacts have&#13;
been identified and addressed in the Environmental Assessments (EA) and Environmental Management&#13;
Plans (EMP) which were carried out as part o f the feasibility studies for the expansion o f the Kabul water&#13;
supply system (fundedby KfW)and about 22 provincial towns (funded by IDA and ARTF). Issues o f&#13;
wastewater disposal and treatment have been analyzed under the IDA-fundedStrategic Sanitation Plan&#13;
and Sewerage/Drainage Master Plan for Kabul and the Sanitation Strategy for provincial cities. They will&#13;
be addressed under the proposed FY07 Urban Waste Management Project (for on-site sanitation) and a&#13;
possible FY08/09 second Urban Water Sector project (for sewerage). The proposed project will improve&#13;
existing arrangements for water treatment, water quality monitoring, and importantly the establishment o f&#13;
groundwater protection zones to ensure sustainability o f the resource. Issues o f security o f access to bulk&#13;
water, inter-sectoral water allocation, conjunctive use o f ground and surface water are beingaddressed&#13;
through the strategic study on long-term WSS issues for Kabul and follow-up activities inKabul and&#13;
other regions (Annex 7).&#13;
&#13;
Social assessment&#13;
3.        Social assessment and socio-economic surveys were carried out under ongoing WSS projects as&#13;
part o f the feasibility studies for WSS system expansion. Inaddition, a qualitative assessment o f past&#13;
experiences in community involvement in WSS in Kabul and other larger cities, e.g. by UN-Habitat, will&#13;
be carried out, along with a review o f the experiences amongNGOs/INGOsand UN agencies o f WSS-&#13;
related health-hygiene campaign. Particular attention will be paid to the potential for women's&#13;
employment, e.g. as attendants at water kiosks, as well as other jobs related to public water supply and&#13;
sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
4.        The components o f the project will benefit households in general by providing increased level of&#13;
services includingwater, sanitation health awareness training. While women and children are not&#13;
specifically targeted, they will be the primary beneficiaries o f the interventions inwater and sanitation in&#13;
terms o f health gains (the under-5 mortality rate is currently 25%) and reducedworkload inwater&#13;
collection. The realization o f these benefits will be ensured through the provision o f health education as&#13;
part of the water and sanitation interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Involuntary Resettlement&#13;
5.       OperationalPolicy 4.12 is triggered.Althoughno resettlement issues are expected, there will be a&#13;
need for limited land acquisitionfor the new pumpingstation and reservoir envisaged as part of the Logar&#13;
I1sub-project. Furthermore,maintenance of the right-of-wayfor the transmission line to the reservoir&#13;
will also requirelandacquisitionas the alignment will cut across a hill which is rapidly turningintoa&#13;
residentialarea. A survey is beingconductedto document and clarify the status of the land involvedand&#13;
to determine the number of people affected.&#13;
&#13;
6,       An abbreviated ResettlementFramework (seeAnnex 2 of the ESMF) has been developed&#13;
containingpolicies and procedures for restoringhousing and compensating for loss of landand livelihood&#13;
of project affectedfamilies in a consultativeand mutuallyagreeablemanner, compliantwith OP 4.12.&#13;
Privatevoluntary donations will be documentedas requiredby the Framework, as will compensation&#13;
payments made by the community.For government land, documentation will be requiredthat the land is&#13;
free of encroachments, squatters or other encumbrances,and has beentransferredfor the project by the&#13;
authorities. A satisfactoryand policy compliant settlement of the land issues is apreconditionfor project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
7.       No activitieswill be supported that requireinvoluntary landacquisitionor the acquisition of land&#13;
requiringthe resettlementor compensationof more than 200 people. Consequently, no Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan will be requiredfor the proposedproject.&#13;
&#13;
CulturalProperty&#13;
8.       OPN 11.03 is triggered.The proposedprojectis unlikely to pose a risk of damagingcultural&#13;
property.The Safeguards Frameworkincludesa negative list that precludes any activity that would&#13;
significantly damage nonreplicableculturalproperties.The framework also includesguidelinesfor&#13;
chance-finds o f cultural property, so that appropriate proceduresare followed.&#13;
&#13;
I ndigenous Peoples&#13;
9.       OP 4.10 is not triggered. There are no groups classifiedas IndigenousPeoples inAfghanistanand&#13;
throughthe plannedfollow-on social assessments,the projectwill explorehow to ensure greater social&#13;
equity in outreachthrough community participationand involvementof women inplanningand service&#13;
delivery.&#13;
&#13;
Projects on International Waterways&#13;
10.      OP 7.50 is not triggered becausethe project only supports investments for abstraction of water&#13;
from locally confinedground water aquifers and hence will not have any measurable impact on&#13;
internationalwaters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Management Framework(ESMF)&#13;
&#13;
11.      Socio-economicand EnvironmentalAssessments have beencompletedas partof feasibility&#13;
studies duringprojectpreparation. In addition, the ESMF for this project (see summary and additional&#13;
details in Attachment) builds upon the generic safeguardframework developed for emergency operations&#13;
in Afghanistan andusedfor all emergency operations, includingthe ongoingARTF UrbanWater Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Project with MOUD(see Box below).The following box indicatesthe key elements ofthe&#13;
generic safeguards framework in effect for emergency operations in Afghanistan. These are also reflected&#13;
in the screening frameworkthat follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             Box: Basic Safeguard Frameworkfor Emergency Operations inAfghanistan&#13;
&#13;
     It is acknowledged that currently social and environmental management in Afghanistan is suffering from&#13;
critical capacity constraints. Since there is potential for adverse impacts, albeit limited, on the environment due&#13;
to the proposed activities under emergency operations, their mitigation and management is key to wholesome&#13;
rehabilitation and development of neighborhoods. Hence, keeping in view the existing social and environmental&#13;
management capacity, as well as the flexibility required with investments still to be finalized, a framework&#13;
approach is adopted for emergency operations. It allows the early identification of potential adverse impacts,&#13;
without the requirement of rigorous analysis through quantification, and also provides broad guidance for their&#13;
effective mitigation. Consistent with existing national legislation, the objective of the Framework is to help&#13;
ensure that activities under the project will:&#13;
&#13;
          Protect humanhealth;&#13;
          Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;&#13;
          Prevent environmental degradation as a result o f either individual subprojects or their cumulative&#13;
          effects;&#13;
          Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,&#13;
          Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguard policies.&#13;
&#13;
     Recognizingthe emergency nature of proposedreconstructionoperations, and the related needfor providing&#13;
assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing potential environmental and social risks,&#13;
this Framework is basedon the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
o    The proposedoperations will support multiple subprojects,the detailed designs of which may not be known&#13;
     at appraisal. To ensure the effective application o f the World Bank's safeguard policies, the Framework&#13;
     provides guidance on the approach to be taken during implementation for the selection and design of&#13;
     subprojects,andthe planning of mitigation measures;&#13;
&#13;
o    All proposed investments will be screened to ensure that the environmental and social risks can be&#13;
     adequately addressed through the application of standardizedguidelines;&#13;
&#13;
o    Project design and subproject selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity between genders,&#13;
     and ethnic and religious groups, considering variations in population density. Employment opportunities&#13;
     within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the basis of professional competence,&#13;
     irrespective of gender, or ethnic or religious group. In all projects which require consultations with local&#13;
     communities or beneficiaries, gender-separated consultations will be conducted to elicit the views of the&#13;
     female population, along with that ofthe male population; and,&#13;
&#13;
o    Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs of these operations.&#13;
     Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework will be&#13;
     disclosed in Afghanistan in Dari and Pashto, and inthe World Bank Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          60&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Safeguard Screening&#13;
&#13;
12.     Although project interventionsare reasonablywell-defined, there may be variations or additional&#13;
investments(for well drilling, pumpingstations, water treatment facilities, and distributionnetworks) that&#13;
requiresafeguard screeningduringthe project. Inthis case, the following approachthat has been adopted&#13;
for similar World Bank financed projectsinAfghanistanwill be used.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The selection, design, contracting, monitoringand evaluation of any subprojects identified later&#13;
will need to be screened and assessed for environmentaland social impacts according to the guidelines&#13;
contained in the ESMF (see project files). The ESMF and guidelines are also available at the World Bank&#13;
Infoshop, on the World Bank internet site or at the World Bank Office, Kabul.&#13;
&#13;
14.     The sub-projectswill be screened according to the following criteria to determine if (i)they are&#13;
ineligible, or (ii) need no additional assessment, or, (iii) need a Limited Environmental and Social&#13;
Assessment (LESA), or (iv) need full environmental and social assessments. All LESAs and Full&#13;
Environmental and Social Assessments have to be cleared by the World Bank before implementationof&#13;
civil works is initiated.&#13;

Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
15.     MOUD will have overall monitoring responsibility through its Water Supply and Environmental&#13;
Sanitation Department. A designated Safeguards Nodal Officer will be identified within AUWSSC with&#13;
responsibilityfor overseeingthe implementationof the Environmentaland Social Safeguards Framework&#13;
and Management Plan. The KfW-funded Consultant firm that implements the project investment&#13;
components will have primary responsibility as per the terms of their Contract to ensure adequate social&#13;
and environmental mitigation and management during design, construction and operation, as shown&#13;
below:&#13;

Capacity Building&#13;
&#13;
16.      As part of the social and environmental capacity building that will be provided for&#13;
implementationof IDA-financed operations in Afghanistan, the Safeguards Focal Officer and relevant&#13;
staff of MOUD, AUWSSC and Consultants will receive training in the application of the Safeguard&#13;
Framework. Specialisttraining modules may be considered after an acceptable level of base knowledge&#13;
has been established. The capacity building activity will be implemented under the training component of&#13;
the project and also through a separate Technical Assistance program for Social and Environmental&#13;
management implemented by the newly created National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA).&#13;
During supervisiono f the project, the World Bank will assess the implementationof the Framework, and&#13;
ifrequired, will recommendadditionalstrengthening.&#13;
&#13;
17.      Through the implementation process, NGOs will facilitate community mobilization and&#13;
participation in UWSS activities as well as undertake an extensive health hygiene campaign to increase&#13;
the benefits of improvedwater supply and sanitation. Awareness campaignswill be funded by KfW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Awareness Raisingand Facilitation of Inter-Agency Collaboration&#13;
&#13;
18.      These activities will include:(i) Environmentalawareness improvement(effectiveuse of media,&#13;
internet, public forums, consultations, newsletters, messageswith billing, etc.); (ii)Improving critical&#13;
inter-agency collaboration; (iii) Providesupport to develop and implementan effectiveGrievance&#13;

plan), and (iii) environmentaland social assessmentsas part of planningandpreparationstudies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Participation Framework&#13;
&#13;
19.      Participation is a process through which stakeholders influence and share control over&#13;
development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. This process will be carried&#13;
out through the different stages of proposed project Le. selection of investments, planning,&#13;
implementationand monitoring for which a strategy will be prepared (by the consultants implementing&#13;
the project components, notably urban upgrading, as part of inception reports), with the following&#13;
objectives:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   Understand existing modes of participation to improve the effectiveness of stakeholder&#13;
         participation. Collaborate with government to identify appropriate stakeholders. Recognize&#13;
         customs, beliefs, attitudes and constraints related to participation are gender-specific and stem&#13;
         from the fact that men and women play different roles, have different needs, and face different&#13;
         constraints on a number of different levels.&#13;
&#13;
     0   Develop a strategy for involving stakeholders as participants and monitoring and evaluating&#13;
         participationand outcomes that involves both quantitative and qualitative tracking of indicators&#13;
         over the life of the project which is done with the direct involvement of the communitieswhose&#13;
         participationis beingmonitored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     62&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20.     Duringthe process o f consultations with local communities, separate arrangements shall be made&#13;
to ensure participation by and consultation with women, as they can not be expected to be covered&#13;
through the general community consultations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Consultationand Disclosure&#13;
&#13;
21,     The Project's Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was developed on the basis of an&#13;
overall Framework for World Bank-funded reconstruction operations which was prepared in consultation&#13;
with the principal NGOs and development partners participating in reconstruction activities in&#13;
Afghanistan. Prior to approval o f the project by the World Bank Board, it will be disclosed by the&#13;
Government in both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be made available at the World&#13;
Bank's Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
22.     The project will support feasibility studies for future large urban infrastructure schemes, for&#13;
which World Bank safeguard policies relating to consultation and disclosure will apply, if they are&#13;
financed by IDA. In particular, for environmental Category A and B investments (as defined in World&#13;
Bank Operational Policy 4.0 1, Environmental Assessment) proposed for future operations, the&#13;
implementing agency will consult project-affected groups and local non-governmental organizations&#13;
about the project's environmental and social aspects, and will take their views into account.            The&#13;
executing agency will initiate such consultations as early as possible, and for meaningful consultations,&#13;
will provide relevant material in a timely manner prior to consultation, in a form and language that are&#13;
understandable and accessible to the groups beingconsulted.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
23.     This section provides additional details (see Table ES1below for summary) for procedures and&#13;
guidelines for implementation o f ESMF mitigation and enhancement measures.&#13;

&#13;
ENVIRONMENTALISSUES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Aquifer Protection&#13;
&#13;
24.     A critical need is to ensure sustainability o fthe water supplies for Kabul, both for water quality&#13;
and quantity. This would require a concerted effort to protect the current lifeline aquifers for Kabul,&#13;
which could remain the cheapest source o f water supply for Kabul in any scenario o f supply options.&#13;
&#13;
25.     These would entail initiating a zoning for aquifer protection. The environmental assessmenthas&#13;
indicated areas that need to be considered as part o f aquifer protection zones (see figure below). These&#13;
areas needto have special consideration, especially in the future, to minimize the chances o f irreversible&#13;
aquifer contamination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       63&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26.      Enforcingzoning for aquifer protectionwould be difficult for such large areas of Kabul, but it is&#13;
essential to move seriously inthis directionto ensure sustainabilityofthe resource base. This couldbe&#13;
facilitated by the following activities that would be supported by the project:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Demarcationof Aquifer ProtectionZones: markingthe aquifer regions with signboards andmaps&#13;
         on ground and improving local awareness and communicationwith key development approving&#13;
         agencies&#13;
&#13;
    0    Annual Aquifer Audit: This would includea periodic audit ofthe State of Kabul's Water Sources&#13;
         that would document the existing situationinthe aquifer protectionzones, the monitoringo f land-&#13;
         use changes, identificationof threats, and evolution of a management strategyto addressthese&#13;
         (e.g.IPMiIPNM for agricultural areas; inform industrial siting/compliancemanagement,&#13;
         wasteleffluentmanagement, conflict management, recharge, etc.). This reportwould be&#13;
         discussed annually in a multi-sectoralworkshop for follow-up in collaborationwith other&#13;
         agencies. Additional studies would be commissioned as required.&#13;
&#13;
    0    Informing siting of new development: A critical issue is the regulationo f new potentially&#13;
         harmful developments. NEPA, MMI, KabulMunicipality and other agencies that would have a&#13;
         say inthis regard should help develop strategies to regulate potentiallyharmful development (e.g.&#13;
         industries/ industrial parks with liquid or solid hazardous waste generationand disposal, landfills,&#13;
         etc.)inthe aquifer protectionzones that couldnegatively impactthe quality and sustainabilityof&#13;
         the aquifer system. In addition, regionaldevelopments (e.g.the new copper miningpotentialat&#13;
         Aynak and other similar activities upstream inthe Logar) should also be examined carefully and&#13;
         adequate protectionplans put in place to mitigate any impacts on these aquifers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      64&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Water Resources and Sustainable Yield&#13;
&#13;
27.     As part o f the environment assessment, the sustainable yield of Kabul's major aquifers was&#13;
determined.The assessment took into consideration:&#13;
&#13;
    0   an assessment of groundwater hydraulicscarried out in 2003 as part of the feasibility study, and&#13;
&#13;
    0   earlier studies including: (i)large-scale groundwater explorationsby the Soviets in 1962/63,(ii)&#13;
        investigations by the German Water Economy Group from 1964 to 1972 that included hydro-&#13;
        geological investigationsand a geo-electricalsurvey, (iii)a comprehensive study on the principal&#13;
        aquifers of Kabul carried out in the seventies by Proctor &amp; RedfernInternationalLtd. of Canada,&#13;
        (iv) studies by the UNFoodand Agriculture Organisation (FAO)&#13;
&#13;
    The potentialof the local aquifers has beendeterminedas follows:&#13;

&#13;
28.     Accordingto the environment assessment, the Upper Kabul River aquifer (UKRA) and the Logar&#13;
River aquifer are the only aquifers with a potential for extension of the already existing wellfields. The&#13;
Lower Kabul river aquifer (LOKRA) has limits both in quantity and quality parameters; the Paghman&#13;
river aquifer has a high storage capacity but very limited recharge because of the small catchment area of&#13;
the river. Its capacity needsto be downgraded. Possibilitiesto extendthe UKRA exist mainly south of the&#13;
Allaudin weels, preferably on the left bank of the Kabul River. The Logar aquifer has the potential to&#13;
sustain a substantial additional number of wells. Future well drilling should concentrate on the left bank&#13;
of the Logar River to the East and West of the village of Shewaki, Le. the former investigationzone 11.&#13;
Small-scale geophysical investigations and test drilling are required in both aquifers before final well&#13;
siting. Further consideration of artificial recharge of the aquifers should be based on experience with the&#13;
operation of existingand future wells and must be compatiblewith overallbasindevelopment (Annex 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Water Quality and PublicHealth&#13;
&#13;
29.     Duringthe environmentalassessment as part of the feasibility study, water quality inthe&#13;
proposedwell fields was tested. The German FederalInstitutefor Geo-Sciences andNaturalResources&#13;
carriedout the groundwater survey of the Kabul aquifers.They analyzed water from many shallowwells,&#13;
and from 9 of CAWSS's deep wells. Exceptfor a slightly elevatedconcentrationof Borondioxide,which&#13;
is not hazardousto man, only one well (OY3) has shown a significant exceedance of the WHO limit of&#13;
50mgilnitrate.It has been suggestedthat this water be mixedprior to distribution.&#13;

Monitoring of water quality&#13;
&#13;
30.      The water quality will be monitoredon a periodicalbasis to ensurethat any threats to public&#13;
.&#13;
health are identifiedin a timely manner. At a minimum, this will include:&#13;
&#13;
    Testingwater quality at source bore-wellsandreservoir(daily for pH, weekly for bacteriologicalplate&#13;
    counts and nitrates, monthly for BOD, COD, annuallyfor complete chemicalanalysis, includingfor&#13;
    toxic metals and pesticides)&#13;
    Testing for a sample of households (100 representativehouseholds every six months for residual&#13;
    chlorine, bacteriologicalplatecounts, andpH)&#13;
&#13;
3 1.     This informationwill be collectedand analyzed usingstandard samplingand analysis protocols,&#13;
with proper labelingand loggingof information. The informationwill be computerized, comparedwith&#13;
past data and trends and reportedto the CAWSS/AUWSSC,MOUD, KabulMunicipality, the Ministry o f&#13;
Public Healthandthe NationalEnvironmentalProtectionAgency (NEPA). Appropriatemitigation&#13;
measures(e.g. switching/blendingsources, additionaltreatment, public advisories, etc.) will be&#13;
undertakenas requiredby the water quality results. Basedonthe first few months of operation, standard&#13;
operating protocolswould be developedwith technical assistancefromthis project.&#13;
&#13;
32.      Appropriate mechanisms for communicationo fthese reports (at periodic intervalsand during&#13;
crises) to the general public will also be evolvedduring project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
3 3 .    Additional codes o f practicefor preventionand mitigation of water quality-relatedpublic health&#13;
impacts are provided in Attachment 7 ofthe ESMF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Construction-relatedimpacts&#13;
&#13;
34.      There are a number of construction-relatedenvironmentaland social impacts that needto be&#13;
consideredas part of the UWSS project.These include, among others, the issuesof:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   Resettlement &amp; Rehabilitation&#13;
     0   Silt disposal&#13;
     0   Excavatedarea/Borrowarea rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    66&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0   Labor camp environment&#13;
    0   Contract clauses for chance finds (cultural property)&#13;
    0   Mining (UXO) protection&#13;
&#13;
35.     In order to minimize the potential adverse impacts of construction, standardbiddingdocuments&#13;
will have the following environmental precautionary clauses:&#13;
&#13;
     0  The natural landscape should be preservedto the extent possible by conducting operations in a&#13;
        manner that will prevent unnecessarydestruction or scarring of natural surroundings. Except&#13;
        where required for permanent works, quarries, borrow pits, staging and processing areas, dumps,&#13;
        and camps, all trees, saplings, and shrubbery should be protected from unnecessary damage by&#13;
        project related activities. After unavoidable damage and to restore quasi-original conditions were&#13;
        appropriate;&#13;
&#13;
    b   Contractor's operations should be so performed as to prevent accidental spillage of contaminants,&#13;
        debris, or other pollutants, especially into streams or underground water resources. Such&#13;
        pollutants include untreated sewage and sanitary waste, tailings, petroleum products, chemical,&#13;
        biocides, mineral salts, and thermal pollution;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Wastewater, including those from aggregate processing and concrete batching, must not enter&#13;
        streams without settling ponds, grade Ifilters, or other process, so as not to impair water quality&#13;
        or harm aquatic life;&#13;
&#13;
     b  The contractor should ensure proper disposal of waste materials and rubbish. Ifdisposal by burial&#13;
        or fire, it should not cause negative impact to either the air, soil nor ground water supplies;&#13;
&#13;
     0  The contractor should minimize air and water pollution emissions. Dust from the handlingor&#13;
        transporting of aggregates, cement, etc., should be minimized by sprinkling or other methods.&#13;
        Materials, brush or trees should only be burned when the owners permits, under favorable&#13;
        weather conditions;&#13;
&#13;
    0   The contractor's facilities, such as warehouse, labor camps, and storage areas, should be planned&#13;
        in advanceto decide what the area will look like upon completion of construction. These facilities&#13;
        should be located so as to preservethe natural environment (such as trees and other vegetation) to&#13;
        the maximum extent possible;&#13;
&#13;
     0  After project construction, camps and building should either serve as permanent residencesand&#13;
        form future communities, if such use can be foreseen and approved, or be torn down and the area&#13;
        restoredto its quasi-original condition in order to avoid deterioration into shanty towns;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Borrow pits should be landscapedand planted accordingly to an ecological design to provide&#13;
        some substitute area for lost natural landscapes and habitats.&#13;
&#13;
36.     A detailed Environmental Management Action Plan listingthe environmental issues and the&#13;
specific mitigation measures for addressing them at the pre-construction, construction and operations&#13;
stages of the project interventions is provided in Attachment 4 of the ESMF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Cultural Property&#13;
&#13;
37.     Specific guidelines and procedures for protection of chance finds of cultural significance will be&#13;
followed, as provided in Attachment 5 of the ESMF.In addition, the negative list (Attachment 2 of the&#13;
ESMF) prohibits activities that will destroy non-replicable cultural property at the sites mentioned therein.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      67&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Mine Hazards&#13;
&#13;
38.     Specific procedures have been designed to respond to the risk caused by the presence o f mines in&#13;
Afghanistan. These procedures, presented in Attachment 6 o f the ESMF, will be followed during the&#13;
course of all construction activities funded by the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOCIAL ISSUES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Land Acquisition&#13;
&#13;
39.     All physical investments must conform to the Guidelines for land and asset acquisition,&#13;
entitlementsand compensation, which are detailed inAttachment 3 o f the ESMF. Proposals that require&#13;
more than minor expansion, along rights o f way, demolishing houses or acquiring productive land should&#13;
be carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid their impacts through alternative alignments. No land or asset&#13;
acquisition may take place outside o f these guideIines. An Abbreviated Resettlement Framework&#13;
defining rules and procedures is attached as Attachment (3 (i)and a format for Land Acquisition&#13;
Assessment is attached as Attachment 3(ii) o fthe ESMF.&#13;
&#13;
40.     These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons to ensure that&#13;
all such persons negatively affected, regardless o f their land tenurekenancy status, will be assisted to&#13;
improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or production capacity to pre-project&#13;
levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CommunityManagementof Informal Services&#13;
&#13;
41.     It will be many years before Kabul and other large towns will be covered by formal provision o f&#13;
services in the WSS sector. The alternative is community management o f informal service provision&#13;
which needs to be officially acknowledged and the potential for community participation strengthened to&#13;
ensure greater involvement o f and responsiveness to local demand and to ensure better downward&#13;
accountability, particularly in face o f local-level corruption. Furthermore, government institutions needto&#13;
increase their capacity to work with civil society organizations and to coordinate and regulate initiatives&#13;
by non-governmental actors.&#13;
&#13;
42.     Explorative work and Pilots are requiredto develop an inclusive and community managed system&#13;
of supply and maintenance o f public water sources (stand pipes, wells and water takers) in areas which&#13;
will not be covered by the domestic connections for the foreseeable future. Experiences from Mazar&#13;
indicate that community management functions best when the community contracts specific work&#13;
functions or services out to individuals. Specialized intermediationmay be requiredto facilitate the&#13;
formation o f effective user groups in the urban context, where individual connections are not affordable&#13;
and shared connections, or public wells or tanker service, are provided instead.&#13;
&#13;
43.     Another important set o f intermediary services relates to customer awareness and education.&#13;
While beneficiary consultation is mandatory, it may be necessary to involve NGO facilitation inthe&#13;
consultation and information o f the urban customers to ensure that they are fully aware o f what&#13;
arrangements are being made on their behalf, what types o f services they will have access to, and what&#13;
kind of assistance they can request - and what are their options and need for organizing themselves in&#13;
effective user groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Gender&#13;
&#13;
44.       Piped water is not available on a 24-hour basis anywhere in Afghanistan, and both inrural and&#13;
urban areas women and children play a major role in collectingand storing water for domestic use. The&#13;
cooking and cleaning of the household are almost entirely female chores across all wealth groups, and so&#13;
i s child care and training of children in personal hygiene.&#13;
&#13;
45.       The health indicators for Afghanistan are amongthe worst in the world, with under-fivemortality&#13;
around 25%. The prevalence of water-borne diseases is high, and seven out of nineo f the most common&#13;
diseases are related to poor water quality and sanitation, plus poor personal hygiene practices. Hygiene&#13;
education is thus neededto ensure that people get the full benefits that improvedwater supply and&#13;
sanitation offer. It is already common to find NGOs providing education and awareness building in the&#13;
rural and urban water supply sector.&#13;
&#13;
46.       Women and girls are key actors in water and sanitation activities, both as `water handlers',&#13;
consumers and as the main `hygiene instructors' of the households. This fact needs to be fully realized&#13;
and incorporated in any water and sanitation strategy which aims at introducing behavioral changes and&#13;
improved health as an outcome of increasedsupply and access to water and sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
47.       Dueto the social and cultural restrictions put on women's mobility and participation in public&#13;
life, community consultations regarding water supply and sanitation needto be conducted with men and&#13;
women separately, and the same applies to face-to-face instruction in health education. Exploratory work&#13;
and Pilots need to be conducted to develop models for women's active involvement incommunity&#13;
managed public water sources (public stand pipes, public wells), which could possibly offer income&#13;
opportunities for vulnerable households (e.g. very poor, disabled, widows).&#13;

 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
 1.        NRVA 2005 provides the most recent data on water supply according to which there presently is&#13;
 18% coverage o f piped water supply in urban Afghanistan. Even ifthe concerted efforts o f the&#13;
 Government and the support o f several donors have resulted in improvements since 2002, the task ahead&#13;
 i s daunting, and it will be many years before all the gozars (neighborhoods) o f Kabul and other large&#13;
 towns will be covered by formal provision of services in the WSS sector. A possible alternative is&#13;
 community management o f informal service provision which, however, needs to be officially&#13;
 acknowledged and the potential for community participation strengthened to ensure greater involvement&#13;
 o f and responsiveness to local demand and to ensure better downward accountability, particularly in face&#13;
 o f local-level corruption. Furthermore, government institutions need to increase their capacity to work&#13;
 with civil society organizations and to coordinate and regulate initiatives by non-governmental actors.&#13;
&#13;
 2.        Initiatives have been taken by different agencies (e.g. UN-Habitat, NGOs) over the past decade in&#13;
 terms o f various levels of community participation/citizeninvolvement in urban development and&#13;
 specifically in service provision. Mazar-i Sharif has a rather unique position among the cities o f&#13;
 Afghanistan as it has independent, functioning and elected community councils representing all 10 city&#13;
 districts, which are working already for more than ten years. These councils, steered by a local NGO, the&#13;
 Community Forum Development Organization (CFDO), took over responsibility to run community&#13;
 forums from UN-Habitat, who first initiated the whole process inthe mid-1990s.In some parts o f Kabul,&#13;
 local communities have been involved in community-based upgrading activities                    - but different&#13;
 experiences have neither been compared nor assessed, and clear lessons are still to be drawn.&#13;
&#13;
                                                     The `Mazar Model'5&#13;
I The kalantar is the official neighborhood representativeswho are acknowledgedby the municipality. There are 195&#13;
 kalantars in Mazar, representingthe 199 neighborhoodsthat currently make up the city. Among the main activities&#13;
 of the kalantar is: Collecting money from the community for public works, such as construction of communal&#13;
 buildings (mosque), wiring for electricity, well digging, etc. organizing peopleto carry out these tasks. Many ofthe&#13;
 decisionsa kalantar takes for his community are made in consultation with a council of local elders, so that any&#13;
 wider community issuesthat may require contributions such as time, labor and cash are backed up and agreed upon.&#13;
 However, these councils are not involved in community-basedupgradingactivities, nor do they directly work&#13;
 together with the municipality.Instead they attempt to address (with external funding) the pressingissue of&#13;
 insecurity of employment in Mazar by providing a variety of skills-building income generatingprojects as well as&#13;
 educationalprojects and social services.&#13;
&#13;
 The urbanpoor and vulnerable are widely excluded from access to basic services all over Mazar, giving rise to&#13;
 potentially hazardous situations and reinforcingtheir vulnerable situation. Inspite of community shura on the&#13;
 district level and kalantars working in each neighborhood, the very poor often lack representation,and as a&#13;
 consequence are sometimes excluded from assistance flows. Consequently,there is a needto better realize local&#13;
 poverty differentiation and to uncover the poverty niches inthe heterogeneous urban environment in order to ensure&#13;
 that the "poorest" are included in local decision-making processes, and that those who are better off are not&#13;
 capturingbenefits o f support activities (ibid).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
3 ,      Experiences from Mazar indicate that community management functions best when the&#13;
community contracts specific work functions or services out to individuals. Specialized intermediation&#13;
may be required to facilitate the formation o f effective user groups inthe urban context, where individual&#13;
connections are not affordable and shared connections, or public wells or tanker service, are provided&#13;
instead.&#13;
&#13;
Objective&#13;
&#13;
4.       The objective of the study is to develop models for an inclusive and community managed system&#13;
o f supply and maintenance o f public water sources (stand pipes, wells and water takers) in areas which&#13;
will not be covered by the domestic connections for the foreseeable future. Provision should be made for&#13;
women's active involvement in community managed public water sources, and models should be&#13;
explored for how community managed public water supply could serve as an income source for&#13;
vulnerable households.&#13;
&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
&#13;
5.       Assess and consolidate existing studies (e.g. AREU) and documented experiences in Afghanistan&#13;
on urban, community participation/managementin service provisionhrban upgrading (e.g. CFDO in&#13;
Mazar-i Sharif, UN-Habitat, NGOs and other agencies).&#13;
&#13;
6.       Conduct social survey in selected gozars o f Kabul (which will not be covered by the formal&#13;
provision o f services inthe WSS sector in the near future) in cooperation with UWSP and KURP to&#13;
assess feasibility and potential model for inclusive, community managed WSS system. Focus should be&#13;
o to establish a socio-economic profile o fthe community and households, incl. land &amp; house tenure&#13;
     status, identifying the vulnerable households, and HHs' present WSS provision and expenditures&#13;
o to assess existing water sources o f HHs, and expenditures and time spent on water collection,&#13;
o to assess potential o f existing community-based organizations and active NGOs/CSOs in the area,&#13;
     social capital o f the community&#13;
o    to assess women's economic participation and potential for active involvement incommunity water&#13;
     source management.&#13;
&#13;
7.       On the basis o f above information collected through household interviews and community level&#13;
discussions (gender segregated) and combined with relevant internationalBest Practices:&#13;
&#13;
A. For Public Water Sources @on-pipedwater sources)&#13;
     Develop model for inclusive, community managed WSS system to be piloted in selected gozars in&#13;
     Kabul incl. models for women's active involvement in community managed public water sources&#13;
     (implementation to be financed from other sources).&#13;
     Develop models for future sources and technical solutions for provision o f potable water for&#13;
     communities outside network, incl. contracting arrangements&#13;
     Develop models for management o f public water sources which may offer an income source for&#13;
     vulnerable households (very poor/disabled/widows/ women-headed households). Also review&#13;
     opportunities for water vending&#13;
     Define the roles and responsibilities o f Kabul Municipality and Kabul Water Supply Authority in&#13;
     supplying water to the areas not covered by the services o f CAWSS, particularly in terms in&#13;

Introduction&#13;
1,      The BankNetherlandsWater PartnershipProgram(BNWPP) has supported a study to&#13;
systematicallyexamine the key attributes o fthe various water projectsthat are plannedinthe Upper&#13;
Kabul river basin from the perspectiveo f Kabul's water supply, taking into account the technical,&#13;
economic, financial, social and environmentalconstraints, and for developinga decisionsupport&#13;
framework for development of water resources of the Kabulregion.This work also includedthe&#13;
development of a long-termactionplanfor creatingcapacity and institutionalmechanismsfor integrating&#13;
water resourcesmanagement inthe Kabulregion.&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.     The objectiveo fthis study was to analyze the medium and long-termoptions for expansionof&#13;
water supply to the City of Kabul inthe context of the optimum multi-purposedevelopmentand use of&#13;
the water resources o f the Upper Kabul River basin (seebelow detailed schematic).&#13;

3 ,       A second objective of this study was to assemblewhat is knownabout the UpperKabulRiver&#13;
basin and existing and potentialdevelopment o f its water resources into a simple andreadilyused&#13;
DecisionSupport System (DSS) that would facilitate and enable thejoint multi-sectoranalysis of&#13;
development options in the basin by the concerned ministries and their developmentpartners.&#13;
&#13;
Approach&#13;
4.       The approach of this study was to develop a DecisionSupport System(DSS) for the Upper Kabul&#13;
River basin and to use the DSS to analyze and assess the various options basedon their cost, economic&#13;
impacts, and long-termconsistency with development goals andtrends invarious sectors. The DSS&#13;
consists oftwo major components: an economic optimizationmodel, and a knowledgebase. The&#13;
knowledge base includesdata on water demand in Kabul, current and potentialdevelopments in various&#13;
sectorsthroughoutthe Upper Kabul River basin, the characteristics o f currentand potentialfuture&#13;
infrastructure, and hydrologic and climatic data.&#13;
&#13;
Implications&#13;
5.       The implicationsof the approachdeveloped indicatethat it is possible to organize even patchy,&#13;
scattered informationon projectsand from various sectoral masterplans to help consider water resources&#13;
management and development options in an integratedmanner. This kind of planningis essential for the&#13;
sustainabledevelopment of the water resourcesof Afghanistan. This work hasto be under the broad&#13;
policy direction of the new Inter-ministerialWater Boardandcoordinatedby its Technical Secretariat.&#13;
The actual work should be done inAfghanistanby a multi-disciplinaryteam of technical specialists&#13;
drawn from the "best and brightest" in Afghanistan. It is critical that basin plans be developed, facilitated&#13;
by such tools and adequate consultation. However, it should also be notedthat such plans would not be&#13;
like "masterplans" developed inthe past; rather they would involve systems for decisionsupport that&#13;
would be periodicallyre-assessedbasedon an evolving knowledgebase and stakeholder opinions.&#13;
&#13;
Benefits and Limitations&#13;
6.        The benefitsof this approach are many. These include:(i)   integratedbasin approach (taking into&#13;
account various supply, multi-sectoraldemands and development/management options); (ii)focal point&#13;
for multiple stakeholders in developingshared vision of basin development; (iii)    determinetrade-offs and&#13;
synergies explicitly; (iv) make best use of availabledata; (v) visual, flexible, readily expandable, andeasy&#13;
to use. Limitations include(i)problems with data quality and coverage; (ii) currently only optimizedover&#13;
single year but system needsto be studiedwith longflow sequences; and (iii)framework is intendedfor&#13;
Planningnot System Operations.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
7.       The institutionalarrangements for water planningin Afghanistan, andhence for the use of such&#13;
water planningtools, are expected to evolveover time (see figure below). A good beginninghas been&#13;
made with the settingup of an Inter-Ministerial Councilfor Water (or National Water Board). It is&#13;
expectedthat this would have a technical secretariat to support its activities and also to take on an interim&#13;
central rolefor basin planningin Afghanistan. This role couldthen eventually be devolvedto basin&#13;
entities as they emerge. There couldbe many options for the exact structure and roles of basinentities,&#13;
but it is inevitablethat such entities(or the centraltechnical secretariat beforethem) would needto&#13;
develop and use decisionsupport tools for short, medium and longterm planningof the water resources&#13;
of the nation. This would be importantin regional, nationaland inter-nationalcontexts.&#13;

PREAMBLEby H i s Excellency the Ministerof UrbanDevelopment and Housing, Engineer&#13;
Yusuf Pashtun.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Twenty four years o f war, conflict and drought have devastated the social, environmental and economic&#13;
structures in Afghanistan. Water resources and infrastructure have suffered. The rehabilitation o f the&#13;
water infrastructure and the rebuilding o f the sector institutions are top priorities o f the Government.&#13;
&#13;
Our water policy is deeply rooted in our Islamic faith and traditions.&#13;
Water is considered sacred, and we have been taught that:&#13;
&#13;
                                       "Water is the source of all life"&#13;
                                          "Polluting of water is a sin'&#13;
                      "Wastage of any commodity, particularly water, is forbidden"&#13;
                           "Water resources are the property of all Humanity"&#13;
&#13;
Water issues have reached a crisis as a result o f population growth and resource depletion. Therefore,&#13;
water management must emphasize conservation and efficiency in water usage. The keys to success in the&#13;
water sector are self-sustainabilityand effectivemaintenance.&#13;
&#13;
Our urban water policy, fixed by the Ministry of Urban Developmentand Housing, must incorporate&#13;

1. DEFINITION OF URBANWATER AND SEWERAGESERVICES&#13;
&#13;
This policy is concerned with the supply of potablewater and sewerage services to the urban and&#13;
peri-urbancommunities of Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Urban areas are defined as those with a population generally in excess of five thousand and falling&#13;
within thejurisdiction of an authority establishedand governed by the Law of Municipalities (Law 794&#13;
of Year 1421 Chapter 2 Article 7).&#13;
&#13;
Peri-urban areas comprise the settlements outside the urban boundaries. These settlements are usually&#13;
populated by low-income families and generally lack basic services, such as water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities.&#13;
&#13;
Water users comprise domestic, institutional,commercialand industrialconsumers.&#13;
&#13;
Importantly, this policy also concerns the collection, treatment and safe disposal of urban waste&#13;
water&#13;
&#13;
The management of solid waste and the products of traditional toilet facilities are specifically excluded&#13;
from this policy. Municipalities or other designated institutions will continue to be responsible for solid&#13;
waste management and the oversight of traditional on-site sanitation facilities.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Urban Developmentand Housinghas jurisdiction over the services and areas as&#13;
defined above. However, in some areas definition may become difficult as there are peri-urban&#13;
and semi-rural characteristics. I n such cases, cooperation between Ministry of Urban&#13;
Development and Housing and Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development will be&#13;
required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. EXISTINGPOLICY AND DOCUMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
This urban water supply and sewerage services policy incorporates relevant elements contained in&#13;
existing laws and regulations. Also included are statements from current international and Government&#13;
agreements. This policy also provides the basis for legislation that will in turn formalize the strategies&#13;
and institutions neededfor the sector to function effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
InternationalPolicy Statements:&#13;
&#13;
       This policy has its foundation in the Mar delPlata Statement (1977) and the Dublin Statement&#13;
       (1992). Also, it is based on the fundamental right to water that is entrenched in the UN&#13;
       Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights General Comment No. 15 (2002), which&#13;
       states:&#13;
&#13;
               "The human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically&#13;
               accessible and affordable waterfor personal and domestic uses"&#13;
&#13;
       Further, Target 10 of the Millennium Development Goals (Rio+lO Summit) states the following&#13;
       objective:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  84&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             "Halving by 2015 theproportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking&#13;
            water and basic sanitation".&#13;
&#13;
Afghan Policy Statements and Legislation:&#13;
&#13;
    Firstly, Article 13 of the Constitution of Afghanistan (1382) defines that the state is&#13;
    responsible for formulating and implementing effective programs for "...increasing of public&#13;
    living standards."&#13;
&#13;
    Articles 137-141 of the Constitution describe the roles and purposes of Provincial Councils and&#13;
    Municipalities as devolvedgovernance institutions.&#13;
&#13;
    The National Development Framework of April 2002 recognizesthe key role of investments in&#13;
    water resources, urban institutions and infrastructure.Also, the National Development Strategy&#13;
    (NDS), currently under preparationhas among its goals the reductionof poverty, the harnessing&#13;
    o f the private sector to promote economic growth, and the protection of the vulnerable parts of&#13;
    the population. Once the interimNDS is publishedlater in 2005, the urbanwater services sector&#13;
    policy will need to be harmonized with it. Access to urban water services is an important&#13;
    component o f the NDS.&#13;
&#13;
    Secondly, the Water Law (1360) deals mainly with irrigation. However, Article 2 states that:&#13;
    "Water belongs to the people and is preserved by the Government."&#13;
     Article 5 of the same law gives priority to the use of water "for drinking and other living&#13;
    requirements."&#13;
&#13;
    The Kabul International Conference on Water Resource Management and Development in&#13;
    Afghanistan April-May 2002, issuedthe "Kabul Understanding" that deals mainly with water&#13;
    resources management and irrigation, but also makes the following statements that are relevant to&#13;
    urbanand domestic water supply:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    "We agree that priority should be given to safe drinking water supply which should be a&#13;
         basic right for all;&#13;
    0    We agree that meeting the priority for drinking water and water for domestic use&#13;
         requires investment in technologies which are affordable and sustainable;&#13;
    0    We agree that all external partners should support national capacity building, including&#13;
         the private sector; the private sector and market-based approaches should play an&#13;
         important role in the development of water resources within an appropriate legislative&#13;
         and regulatory framework;&#13;
    0    We agree that in the short term external funding for water resource management and&#13;
         development will be essential."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The document Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan,          Ministry of Irrigation, Water&#13;
    Resources and Environment (MIWRE) "A strategic policy framework for the Water&#13;
    Sector", emphasizes the need to build institutionalcapacity in the water sector, while at the same&#13;
    time decentralizing operations and controls to the local level, and involving private sector&#13;
    investors:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                85&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   0   "Provision of necessary support and regulations to promote and encourage the development&#13;
       of an effective and dynamic private sector in the natural resource sector generally, and in&#13;
       the water sector especially, guided by the establishednationalpolicies and guidelines."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   "Water delivery services will be decentralized using a variety of autonomous and&#13;
       accountable agencies, including public, private and community -based water users&#13;
       associations and organizations."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    "Urban water supply would be addressedthrough a combination of different mechanisms,&#13;
        includingthe municipality, the Ministry o f Urban Developmentand Housingand the private&#13;
        sector. Autonomous water supply institutions may be created to effectively handle urban&#13;
       water supply."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    "Reorganization and strengthening of government institutionsthat can effectively respondto&#13;
       the presentand future needs o fthe country inthe water sector."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    "In this (decision making) process, three functions can be distinguished: a constitutional-,&#13;
        an organizational- and an operationalone. All functions need to be appliedinan integrated&#13;
       way."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Thirdly, the following legislationexists on the statutes:&#13;
&#13;
    0    Legislationof the Utility of Constructionaland Project Designingfor the Water Supply&#13;
         and Sewerage Network (LAW 651, Year 1987).&#13;
    0    Utility for PreservationMaintenance and Operating of Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
         for Kabul City (LAW 655,1987)&#13;
    0    Legislationof Water Supply Networkand SanitationUtility (LAW 799,2001)&#13;
&#13;
These laws generally establish, as a state-owned utility enterprise, the powers and duties of the&#13;
Central Authority for Water Supply and Sewerage (CAWSS) and the operating service providers in&#13;
Kabul and other citiesitowns.&#13;
&#13;
Fourthly, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF)- Short-term Support to Urban&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Sector (Final Version February 14th,2005)&#13;
&#13;
This document elaborates some key policy objectives for the urban water services sector in&#13;
Afghanistan:&#13;
&#13;
Government's Vision and Objectives include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0   "Transform current sector institutions (notably CAWSS) into high-performing WSS utilities,&#13;
    financially self-sufficient, and customer orientated;"&#13;
0  "To decentralize utility management and to increase the involvement of local government,&#13;
    communities and consumers;"&#13;
&#13;
The ARTF agreement also envisages the strengthening of the human resources of the institutions&#13;
throughthe payment of better salaries andperformance incentives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 86&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. POLICY VISION, OBJECTIVES AND SECTOR REFORM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Government Vision for the UrbanWater and Sanitation Sector reads:&#13;
&#13;
     The urban water supply and sanitation sector shall be reformed and developed to improve the&#13;
     quality of life in all urban communities. By ensuring an equitable provision of potable water&#13;
     and wastewater services at an affordable cost and on a sustainable basis, poverty will be&#13;
     reduced, health generally improvedand economicdevelopmentpromoted.&#13;
&#13;
  The policy broadly seeks to satisfy and balance the interestsof the various stakeholders in society:&#13;
&#13;
     Government,through the MUDH, in meeting national objectives of improving urban water and&#13;
     sewerage services provision.&#13;
&#13;
     The urban population, particularly the poor and marginalized communities, who have pressing&#13;
     social needs following the war.&#13;
&#13;
     Business and commercial interests, who require reliable water supply to facilitate&#13;
     manufacturing and commerce, the engine of economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
     Private Sector investors, who might bring additional funding and/or expertise into water and&#13;
     sewerage services provision and who require an acceptable risk/ return profile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The main objectives and implications of this policy are to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             0    Improve sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sewerage in accordance&#13;
                  with the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.&#13;
             0    Provide the basis for the adoption of technical standards and delivery mechanisms, to&#13;
                  suit the needs of urban and peri-urban settlements.&#13;
             e    Prepare for the decentralization of service delivery from one central authority to local&#13;
                  autonomous entities and provide for community consultation and involvement and&#13;
                  the participation of civic organizations and NGOs.&#13;
             e    Ensure improved operation and maintenance ofthe infrastructure.&#13;
             0    Place emphasis on full cost recovery and the financial sustainability of the service&#13;
                  providers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. SECTOR PRINCIPLES&#13;
&#13;
     4.1 SEPARATION OF WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND URBANWATER&#13;
         SERVICES PROVISION&#13;
&#13;
         The Ministry of Energy and Water has jurisdiction over the nation's surface water&#13;
         resources and is responsible for setting up the policy and structures to manage it.&#13;
&#13;
         The Ministry of Minesand Industrieshasjurisdiction over ground water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   87&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    The Ministry of Urban Development and Housing has jurisdiction over urban water&#13;
    services and is responsible for setting up the policy and structuresto manage it.&#13;
&#13;
   Urban water service providers must apply to River BasinAuthorities for abstraction rights, in&#13;
   the same way as will be requiredo f other users.&#13;
&#13;
4.2 FUNCTIONAL SEPARATION&#13;
&#13;
    A three-tier separation o f functions controllingthe UrbanWater Sector is proposed, as&#13;
    follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0     Constitutional/ Policy Function:&#13;
&#13;
        The central Government, through the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing&#13;
        (MUDH) sets urban water and sewerage services policy.&#13;
        I t s main roles and responsibilities are to formulate policy and legislation for the&#13;
        sector, enter into and coordinate international agreements, and ensure good&#13;
        performance by the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0     Regulation and Supervision Function:&#13;
&#13;
        This function is concerned with the monitoring and supervision of the implementationof&#13;
        sector policy to ensurethat the intentionsof Government are followed.&#13;
        The associated tasks involve setting standards and monitoring the performance and&#13;
        quality of service provision. In addition coordination of national funding such as&#13;
        that provided by donors i s required. Recommending tariffs for Government&#13;
        approval is also included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0     Operational (Service Delivery) Function:&#13;
&#13;
        Service providers are fully responsible for the operationand maintenance of urban water&#13;
        and sewerage systems.&#13;
        The operating entities will be required, either directly or indirectly, to cover all&#13;
        aspects o f the management o f autonomous commercial business units including&#13;
        delivering water, collecting and treating wastewater, maintaining the infrastructure,&#13;
        preparing and meeting budgets for revenue and costs, managing the relationship&#13;
        with customers, and implementing capital projects.&#13;
&#13;
    The three-tier functional separation is envisaged to work bi-directionally, with policy and&#13;
    directionflowing downwards and reportingand other informationflowing upwards.&#13;
&#13;
4.3 LONG RUNCOST RECOVERY&#13;
&#13;
    The urbanwater sector service providers should aimto recover all costs in the longrun. Costs&#13;
   will include both operational costs and investment costs. Water services users will be&#13;
    required to collectively pay for the full costs. In order to make cost recovery possible all&#13;
    water connections should have a meter in good operatingorder and the service providerswill&#13;
   havethe obligation and right to read such meters at cost-efficientintervals, andbill customers&#13;
    in relation to the amount of water consumed. Similarly, consumers will be billed, where&#13;
   applicable, for the collection andtreatment o fwastewater.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             88&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.4 AUTONOMY AND DECENTRALIZATION&#13;
&#13;
    The authority to make operational and local management decisions should lie at the lowest&#13;
    appropriate level. Decentralization o f authority will be extended as institutions become more&#13;
    capable. In order to exercise their authority, service providers must be guaranteed the right to&#13;
    charge customers and collect revenue and to have deficits funded through budget transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.5 HUMANRESOURCES DEVELOPMENT&#13;
&#13;
    The overall shortage o f skilled and experienced human resources will restrain progress in the&#13;
    sector unless addressed.&#13;
&#13;
    Strategies and management models adopted in the sector will therefore aim to develop&#13;
    Afghani managers and workers who could effectively and efficiently manage the provision o f&#13;
    water and sewerage services. Selective skills may be provided on occasion by expatriates,&#13;
    with the objective o f transferring skills to Afghan counterparts.&#13;
&#13;
    A comprehensive HR development plan covering all facets o f water and sewerage will be&#13;
    implemented across all institutions in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.6 TECHNICAL STANDARDIZATION&#13;
&#13;
    Technical standards for design and selection o f materials, plant and equipment will be&#13;
    established in order to minimize the sum o f investment and operating costs over the lifespan&#13;
    of the facilities, time value o f money taken into account.&#13;
&#13;
    Particular attention will be paid to finding infrastructure solutions that lower costs and&#13;
    improve the accessibility to water services by the urban poor.&#13;
&#13;
    Nevertheless, in producing water, and in the treatment o f waste water, water service providers&#13;
    shall ensure that the environment is protected and that the requirements o f the Ministry of&#13;
    Environment and National environmental laws in connection with water abstraction and&#13;
    effluent discharge are followed.&#13;
&#13;
    In urban and peri-urban areas, the Ministry o fUrban Development and Housing will promote&#13;
    efficient water use by all customers, and will take steps to ensure that opportunities to&#13;
    implement approaches such as waste water reuse and aquifer recharge are followed wherever&#13;
    they are viable.&#13;
&#13;
    As far as is practicable and possible, international design and operating standards will be&#13;
    adapted to the needs o f Afghanistan, rather than creatingtotally new standards.&#13;
&#13;
    To this end, documentation will be created, outlining the various standards to be applied.&#13;
    Standards shall cover at least but not be limitedto, the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0   Design criteria for urban water supply and sewerage systems&#13;
        0   Construction materials and electro-mechanical plant and equipment&#13;
            Operations and Safety&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               89&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               0   Tender documentation and biddingprocedures&#13;
               0   Potable water quality, effluent quality and environmental management&#13;
               0   Metering, billing and other customer services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
The present roles o f the various institutions involved inthe sector are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
  0    The MUDHis responsible for setting policy.&#13;
&#13;
  0    CAWSS is responsible for the provision o f water and sewerage services through its branches&#13;
       established in each town/city.&#13;
&#13;
It is an urgent priority to initiate reform o f the sector as performance is inadequate under the present&#13;
institutional arrangements. It is necessary for the sector to place a greater emphasis on efficient service&#13;
delivery, devolution o f responsibility to local institutions, and sustainability o f the sector.&#13;
Therefore, the evolving roles o fthe various institutions involved inthe sector will be as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  0    The MUDHwill remain responsible for setting policy but will also ensure necessary regulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  0    CAWSS as an entity will be corporatised under the commercial law of Afghanistan. CAWSS will&#13;
       delegate its responsibility to the lowest appropriate level of service providers, some o f which&#13;
       might include several urban centers. Such providers will possibly be linked with private&#13;
       management contractors, and include participation by community based organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  0    Where service provision i s decentralized, CAWSS will assume responsibility for monitoring the&#13;
       performance o f the local service providers. The local service providers will be autonomous&#13;
       organizations responsible and accountable for all aspects o f managing and producing&#13;
       improvements in performance, and will ultimately become accountable to supervisory boards.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the sector reforms described in this policy, it is recognized that the resources available from&#13;
within the sector might not be adequate to ensure that the required progress in service delivery takes&#13;
place at an acceptable pace. Therefore, the engagement o f the private sector i s envisaged in order to&#13;
supplement the resources available to the sector. Various options and forms o f contract with the private&#13;
sector are possible, and these will be considered for implementation inthe short to medium term, in line&#13;
with requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. FINANCIALAND COMMERCIAL POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
The following commercial and financial policies shall apply to the urban water sector:&#13;
&#13;
     0   Water is an economic good, limited in availability. Service providers and users alike should&#13;
         reduce losses and wastage on both the supply side and on the demand side.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   The full costs o f providing water services, operating water and sewerage infrastructure, and&#13;
         financing the institutions in the longer term should be borne by the users o f the services. Tariffs&#13;
         and charges will be based on international efficiency norms for water service provision and&#13;
         users will not be expected to pay for gross inefficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      90&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         Although capital projects are largely donor funded at this stage, in the future the sector should&#13;
         strive to finance capital projects through loans raised in the markets, private sector investors&#13;
         and by surpluses generated from revenue collection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Tariffs shall be designed to be efficient, which means that on average tariffs will equate to the&#13;
         long run cost, tariffs shall be financially self-sufficient which means that revenue should cover&#13;
         all costs less subsidies, tariffs shall be affordable which means that low-income consumers will&#13;
         be entitled to subsidies to pay for the services, and tariffs shall be transparent and easily&#13;
         understood by consumers. Life-line tariffs shall be available to ensure a life sustaining service&#13;
         for poor consumers. Consumers will be requiredto settle water and wastewater bills; failure to&#13;
         do so will attract sanctions by the service provider.&#13;
&#13;
Especially:&#13;
&#13;
         Funds generated within the sector will be applied within the sector and shall not be used or&#13;
         applied to non-water related services.&#13;
&#13;
         Government recognizes the need for cross-subsidization and transfer through the tariff system&#13;
         from wealthier to poor users.&#13;
&#13;
         Government will approve tariff levels, and it will define the institutional arrangements to&#13;
         review and implement tariffs and charges.&#13;
&#13;
         Service providers must strive for economic self-sufficiency and efficiency, meaning the&#13;
         reduction and eventual elimination o f subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
         The financial systems o f each water and sewerage service provider should enable the&#13;
         identification o f different service costs, and these costs shall be separated.&#13;
&#13;
         Water and sewerage service providers shall subject their financial affairs to annual audit by&#13;
         external auditors acceptable to CAWSS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 7. SOCIAL POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
 The following social policies will apply to the urban water supply and sewerage sector:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Service providers will ensure that the poor and marginalized communities falling within their&#13;
         urban and peri-urban supply areas receive priority attention in the planning and implementation&#13;
         of water distribution and sewerage projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Women are generally responsible for the collection o f water and its use in the households. As&#13;
         women hold a unique position in Afghani communities, strategies applied by water service&#13;
         institutions will recognize and respect the relevant cultural practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Water services providers are expected to supply adequate water services to the Mosques and&#13;
         Holy Places. Arrangements will be made through the Ministry o f Haj and Islamic Affairs to pay&#13;
         the provider for this supply on the basis o f metered consumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       91&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0   Rapid urbanization in recent years has lead to the proliferation of large unplanned and poor&#13;
        areas surroundingthe cities and towns. Particular attention will be given to finding effective&#13;
        and low-cost alternative ways o f serving these communities with good water and sewerage&#13;
        services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8. SERVICE POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
The following service policieswill apply to the urbanwater supply and sewerage sector:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  0   The service providers in the towns and cities will focus on customer service and customer&#13;
      orientation. Customers will be entitled to receive information on water and sewerage service&#13;
      issues that concern them. A Service Charter will be put in place to articulate the relationship&#13;
      between each service provider and its customers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  0   As a short term objective, and given that water resources are scarce in many places, the quantity&#13;
      of water to be provided for each person served by a private household connection should be a&#13;
      minimum of 40 litres per person per day. Where consideration is given to installing water&#13;
      borne sewerage systems, availability of the required water resources must be a precondition.&#13;
      Generally, the requirement for water borne sewerage increases to about 100 litres per&#13;
      person per day for the households connected to sewers. Each person served by a communal&#13;
      tap should receive a minimum of 15 litres per day.&#13;
&#13;
  0   In the medium to longer term, urban water services providers will endeavor to supply water 24&#13;
      hours per day, seven days per week.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  0   Service pressureafter the water meter should be between 1.5 bar and 6.0 bar.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  0   The quality of drinking water in respect to aesthetic, physical, chemical and microbial properties&#13;
      shall be in accordancewith the standards o fthe World Health Organization(WHO).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9. FROMVISION TO REALITY&#13;
&#13;
The further development of the sector will be elaborated in accordance with this policy in a separate&#13;
strategy paper outlining an Institutional DevelopmentPlan for the Urban Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Sector. As development of the sector proceeds and changes occur in the sectoral context, the Ministry&#13;
of UrbanDevelopmentand Housingwill review and amendthis policy accordingly.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
1. OVERVIEW&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The major objective of institutional reforms within the water sector is to enhance the technical,&#13;
operational andfinancial capabilities of water agencies so they can address the drinking water needs of&#13;
theAfghan people now and infuture. To achieve this objective, several key principles must be adhered to&#13;
asfollows:&#13;
    The treatment of water as an economic commodity, so that the cost of water reflects its true value.&#13;
    That is, to ensure that people are paying for water at a price that can sustain the continued&#13;
    management, operation and maintenance of the systems andpersonnel.&#13;
    The promotion of ownership and involvement by the municipality and the customers served by the&#13;
    systems.&#13;
    Thepromotion of a decentralizedoperational and decisionmakingstructure.&#13;
&#13;
    The encouragement and adoption of modem technology, management practices, organizational&#13;
    structures and standards, notably through theparticipation of theprivate sector&#13;
    The attraction of investmentsfFom markets/ international financial institutions/ donors -necessary to&#13;
    build water andsewerage assets tofully meet the demands of the urbanpopulation&#13;
The needfor reform, along with the rationalefor why a change needs to occur in theAfghan urban water&#13;
sector, is well understood. The struggle is how to effectively implement this change within the political,&#13;
cultural, historical and economic constraintsof society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
The urban population o f Afghanistan has increased dramatically in the last 3 years since the fall o f the&#13;
Taliban. In Kabul alone, refugees have flocked to the city along with people from rural areas seekingjobs&#13;
and the benefits offered by urban life. The population has increased from 1.2 million in 2000 to at least&#13;
2.4 million in 2003. The current country-wide urban population is estimated to be 6.4 million, which i s 30&#13;
percent o f Afghanistan's total population. Of the urban population, 70 percent o f the people are&#13;
concentrated in the six cities o f Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-I-Sharif, Jalalabad and Kunduz.&#13;
&#13;
This massive population relocation to urban areas places tremendous pressure on land and services. The&#13;
challenge o f Afghan urban post-conflict reconstruction is daunting. The needs for space, services,&#13;
employment, municipal capacity and good governance are substantial. If left unaddressed, the quality o f&#13;
life in urban areas will degrade and ultimately the security o f the country will follow. This unfortunate&#13;
chain o f events has been well documented in Afghan history as well as in the history o f numerous other&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
Investment in Afghanistan's water supply and sewerage sectors, both in respect o f capital and operations&#13;
and maintenance has been minimal over the past three decades. This has resulted in a rapid decline o f&#13;
these previously marginal systems to a totally dysfunctional state. The situation has been compounded by&#13;
armed conflict and drought. In response to these circumstances, substantial investments are being made&#13;
and structural deficiencies are being addressed by international donors and financiers, notably the ARTF,&#13;
World Bank-IDA, KfW, GTZ and USAID.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry o f Urban Development and Housing (MUDH) is responsible for urban water supply and&#13;
sanitation (UWSS), along with the coordination o f donor activities and priorities. The Central Authority&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     94&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for Water Supply and Sewerage (CAWSS), which operates under MUDH, is the operations and&#13;
management arm that provide UWSS services in the major urban areas o f Afghanistan. A lack of&#13;
leadership, resources and capabilities at CAWSS and MUDH has resulted in ad hoc developments in the&#13;
operations and maintenance capacity in provincial centres over the last 20 years.&#13;
&#13;
The Government's "Strategic Policy Framework for the Water Sector" calls for major institutional&#13;
reforms, especially in the role o f the Government (under the National Development Framework - NDF)&#13;
from "implementer to a facilitator and regulator" and emphases its constitutional functions of being&#13;
in charge of national planning, establishing laws, policies and strategies.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry o f Urban Development and Housing (MUDH) has drafted a comprehensive UWSS Policy&#13;
that describes the responsibilities andjurisdiction o f MUDHon water issues under its domain. This policy&#13;
i s necessary to carry on the spirit exhibited in the Government's policy for the water sector and the&#13;
policies o f other water agencies, and to strengthen the institutional framework required to more clearly&#13;
define the responsibilities o f different players in the UWSS sector. The policy has been reviewed in the&#13;
context o f the Government's Water Sector policy to determine clear jurisdictional limits for all agencies&#13;
having regulatory and operational roles in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. PRESENTINSTITUTIONAL SETUP&#13;
&#13;
The MUDH is responsible for policy making, regulation and operation o f UWSS services under the&#13;
current institutional framework. At present these functions are carried out by different departments&#13;
within MUDH.&#13;
&#13;
CAWSS, a state owned enterprise (SOE) agency, is the management and operations arm o f MUDH for&#13;
urban water supply and sewerage. CAWSS has personnel in most larger Afghan cities and towns that&#13;
either supervise or directly participate in the management and operation o f water systems. Within this&#13;
operation there are many different arrangements throughout the country due to a lack o f coordinating&#13;
capacity in the central agency. Since the approval o f the CAWSS budget for the year 1384 CAWSS has&#13;
started to decentralize the management o f operations to local branches (13 including Kabul), with&#13;
improved financial accountability, supported by ARTF-FSO.&#13;
&#13;
The organisational set up o f CAWSS is very technically oriented. It i s focused mainly on operations and&#13;
maintenance, The provision o f management, training, cost recovery and financial guidance to water&#13;
service entities has only recently started. The current organizational structure does not sufficiently deal&#13;
with the issues o f improved levels o f services, consumer satisfaction, economic pricing o f water, revenue&#13;
and accounts, and planning. These are factors that must be addressed by any national level agency to&#13;
provide minimum levels o f service to its constituents. The inadequacies o f structure are exacerbated by a&#13;
lack of enabling policy support, inadequate resources and capacity. CAWSS is deficient in meeting&#13;
MUDH'sgoal ofprovidingsustainable and quality water services to the urbanpopulations o fAfghanistan&#13;
by 2015. Also, the present legal framework o f CAWSS, as a state-owned enterprise with limited&#13;
autonomy, will not allow it to reorganise itself to take on the challenges.&#13;

                      communities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This vision is also consistent with the objectives of the National Urban Priority Program, which sees&#13;
increased decentralization of government activities and assumption of a role as facilitator and&#13;
regulator.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                            97&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. ROAD MAP OF THE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTPLAN (IDP)&#13;
&#13;
Implementation o f the vision at once is impossible considering the present limitations in the capacity o f&#13;
the different institutions and the present legislationunder which the institutions function. A road map has&#13;
been developed for a smooth transition from the present situation towards the vision ensuring at the same&#13;
time the proper continuation and development o f services in water supply and sewerage.&#13;
The road map towards the vision consists o f a short-term, a medium-termand a long-term plan allowing&#13;
overlaps of the plans. Progressive advancement along the steps contained in the road map will not be&#13;
based on a rigid timeframe, but will be driven by the attainment o f specific measurable indicators. Such&#13;
indicators may include operational performance benchmarks, degree o f financial autonomy and the&#13;
overall extent o f organisational development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SHORT-TERM PLAN&#13;
&#13;
Inthis phase a few, but important steps will be taken forming the basis for the development o fthe&#13;
medium and long term phases.&#13;
The major components o f the plan are:&#13;
&#13;
e   Component 1: Combining the constitutionaland regulatory functions for execution by MUDH.&#13;
&#13;
e   Component2: Corporatizing CAWSS as it is presentlyfunctioning and renaming it the Afghan&#13;
    Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation (AUWSSC);&#13;
&#13;
e   Component3: Preparation and start of implementationof the objectives of the new&#13;
    Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
e   Component4: Drafting of new legalframework and lawsfor the Urban Water Sector.&#13;
&#13;
Elaboration of Component 1&#13;
&#13;
The existing institutions that regulate the UWSS will be redesigned to support sector reforms. Due to the&#13;
limited capability o f staff in the institutions a functional delineation into two levels, constitutional and&#13;
regulatory functions (strategic/policy functions) and management, operations and maintenance functions&#13;
(operational functions) will be implemented as a start.&#13;
A new section in MUDHwill be developed to carry-out the constitutional and regulatory functions. With&#13;
an adequate level o f capacity building, ample staffing and funding, and legislative authorization MUDH&#13;
will be able to perform these regulatory functions. This approach would facilitate immediate&#13;
improvements in the water sector and provide a training ground for MUDH staff to learn proper&#13;
regulatory policy making and governance practices.&#13;
&#13;
Elaboration of Component2&#13;
&#13;
The new AUWSSC will have autonomy as it will be governed by its board and by the law applicable to&#13;
any commercial entity. The law will form a basis to work with local governments (municipalities) and in&#13;
partnership with the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      98&#13;

&#13;
0   BODresponsible for financial results o f AUWSSC; any deficits in the first years can be covered by&#13;
    grants from the Government and donors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The objective of formingthe new AUWSSC is to initiatethe smooth implementationof the roadmap for&#13;
the institutionaldevelopment o fthe urbanwater supply and sewerage sector, assuringat the same time the&#13;
proper and continuous provision of water supply and sewerage services in the urban centres of&#13;
Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
The new AUWSSC will be structured with a head office in Kabul, branches in cities and towns and a&#13;
number of Strategic Business Units (SBU) for major cities. (See Figure 2.) It will be empowered to&#13;
conduct its duties free from interference by outside parties, so longas its conduct and decisions are in line&#13;
with approved business plans, statutory duties, obligations and rights, as prescribed by MUDH. The&#13;

&#13;
It is recognized that Branches and SBUs will require extended financial support and subsidization from&#13;
Government and donors before they become self-sustaining, Such support is more likely to be required&#13;
duringthe start of the IDP.&#13;
Branches and SBUs will raise revenue in accordance with the tariffs approved by AUWSSC. They will&#13;
be allowed to use such revenue to cover operational costs and to contribute towards capital and service&#13;
improvement projects, under AUWSSC guidance. Financialaffairs will be transparent even at the local&#13;
level, includingany subsidizationoftariffs to particular groups of customers.&#13;

pursue private sector participationor privatization as appropriate to the situation. The number of SBUs&#13;
would also grow, shrinking AUWSSC's full responsibilitiesto a fewer Branches, while it will it will&#13;
continue to provide support to the SBUs. However, AUWSSC will remain chief negotiator and liaison&#13;
body with MUDHfor all the Branches and SBUs and strive to source the funding necessary for general&#13;
improvement in the urbanwater sector.&#13;

&#13;
The Institutional Development Plan is a work in progress that will be reviewed, amended and completed&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Urban Water Sector
            Project are to initiate actions to a) transform the Central
            Authority for Water Supply and Sewerage (CAWSS) into a
            technically viable operation; b) establish the financial
            sustainability of the Afghan Urban Water Supply and
            Sanitation Company (AUWSSC, CAWSS' successor); c)
            increase access to, and reliability of the water supply
            service in Kabul; and, d) prepare a follow-up project under
            which more substantial institutional and financial
            objectives could be achieved, and coverage further expanded
            in Kabul and provincial towns. To achieve these objectives,
            the proposed project will include three main components: 1)
            institutional development of AUWSSC; 2) financial support to
            AUWSSC operations; and, 3) extension of the Kabul water
            supply system. The project will be financed in parallel by KfW.
