1. The Economy and the Transport Sector                                       1&#13;
I. THE ECONOMY AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1   Mauritius is one of the third world's success stories. Over a period of just under a&#13;
quarter-century, the country transformed itself from a sugar-dependent economy with a per-&#13;
capita income of US$300 (1970) to a middle-income country with a per-capita income of&#13;
about US$3,000 (1993), led by a vibrant export-based industrial sector. However, Mauritius&#13;
now faces some constraints to further rapid growth as a result of structural changes in the&#13;
domestic economy and trends in international markets. On the home front, low-priced labor&#13;
has been fully absorbed into the economy, and enterprises face full employment-induced wage&#13;
pressures, current environmental stresses reflect the rapid growth of the last two decades and&#13;
require an appropriate regulatory framework, as well as investment, for improved pollution&#13;
control. On the international front, Mauritius' sugar exports are facing increased uncertainty&#13;
regarding continued access to EU markets at preferential prices, while stiffer competition is&#13;
arising in the textile industry from new low-cost producers. In order to ensure continued&#13;
rapid, sustainable and equitable growth, the country is now addressing these constraints&#13;
through a new strategic agenda including diversification of production and exports,&#13;
improvement of efficiency, and protection of the environment.&#13;
B. The Macro-Economic Context and The Transport System&#13;
1.2   The Republic of Mauritius comprises: the main island of Mauritius (some 800 km east&#13;
of Madagascar) which accounts for about 91% of the land area and 97% of the population;&#13;
and other small scattered islands. The country is on the maritime route between Europe and&#13;
Asia around the southern tip of Africa: this route has regained part of its past importance due&#13;
to the limitations of the Suez Canal, which cannot accommodate mega petroleum tankers.&#13;
However, the remoteness of Mauritius from its traditional trading partners in Europe and new&#13;
ones in Asia poses a challenge to the country in its pursuit of global economic integration.&#13;
1.3   The country's political stability and entrepreneurial spirit have supported a strong&#13;
export-led economic growth which enabled the per capita income increase. Diversification,&#13;
from an agriculture mono-crop (sugar) to light industry, textiles and tourism was at the root&#13;
of Mauritius' success. Since independence in 1968, social indicators have markedly improved:&#13;
life expectancy increased from 64 years to 70, infant mortality declined from 60 per thousand&#13;
to 20, and adult literacy improved from 70 to 85%.&#13;
1.4   Trade has been growing in line with consumption, fueled by rising personal incomes,&#13;
and the diversification of exports. Although sugar remains Mauritius' main export, its&#13;
production is leveling off at around 550,000 to 600,000 tons, with sugar occupying about&#13;
95%  of arable land.  The Government strategy for continued rapid growth relies on&#13;
diversification of production and exports, including products of progressively higher value.&#13;
Import growth is expected to be in line with GDP growth. Efficient maritime and air&#13;
transport will be required to meet competition in export markets from other fast industrializing&#13;
countries such as China or Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                Mauritius: Port Development &amp; Environment Protection Project&#13;
1.5   The country is generally well-linked to the rest of the world. Transport infrastructure&#13;
comprises Port-Louis, the only deep-water port on the island with presently over 3.4 million&#13;
tons of freight p.a., and the International Airport of Plaisance whose passenger and freight&#13;
traffic reached over 1 million persons and about 20,000 tons respectively, in 1994. The inland&#13;
transport system comprises about 1800 km of well maintained roads, 90% of which are paved.&#13;
1.6   The port of Port-Louis plays a key role in the Mauritian economy as the main&#13;
thoroughfare for over 95% of the country's imports and exports. However, the port's capacity&#13;
is now inadequate for handling its growing container traffic, due to insufficient mechanization&#13;
of operations. In addition, port services are not as efficient or competitive as required by the&#13;
business community. Thus, the country has begun to place a high premnium on more efficient&#13;
port operations through improved management of the entities providing port services as well&#13;
as investment to remove critical capacity bottlenecks.&#13;
C. Transport Sector Management, Objectives and Issues&#13;
1.7   The Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (MEPD) oversees transport&#13;
infrastructure development and ensures adequate allocation of public resources to the sector.&#13;
The Ministry of Works (MOW) is in charge of the development and maintenance of main&#13;
highways, while the upkeep of local roads is under local authorities. The National Transport&#13;
Authority (NTA), which is responsible for road transport operators, regulates the passenger&#13;
transport industry through licensing and tariff-setting.  The Mauritius Marine Authority&#13;
(MMA), reporting to the Deputy Prime Minister who is also in charge of MEPD and of the&#13;
Ministry of Internal and External Communications (MIEC), is responsible for port operation&#13;
and maritime transport. Created in 1992, the Mauritius Freeport Authority (WA) has&#13;
responsibility to develop regional trade through transit and transshipment of cargoes on a tax-&#13;
free basis, at both the port and the airport, but has still to develop its role. The Civil Aviation&#13;
Department (CAD) under the MIEC is in charge of air transport regulation. Air Mauritius,&#13;
the national airline, satisfactorily meets the demand for international tourism, along with a few&#13;
foreign carriers; it has public and private shareholders.&#13;
1.8   Rapid economic development has generated a strong demand for better transport&#13;
infrastructure; economic operators often face shortage of capacity and traffic congestion. In&#13;
order to compete effectively, standards need to be raised to levels comparable with those&#13;
found in port, airport and telecommunication facilities offered by Singapore, for example.&#13;
Development plans for transport infrastructure and systems are generated by many sources&#13;
from the public and private sectors, in response to requests by enterprises. MEPD has thus a&#13;
difficult role to play to reconcile and prioritize such demands. The Government's policy&#13;
objectives include the following:&#13;
(i)   promoting the full utilization of existing transport infrastructure to meet peak&#13;
demand when congestion occurs, by using alternative facilities, extending working&#13;
hours or increasing productivity;&#13;
(ii)   encouraging public transportation: air, land, sea to be offered by private&#13;
operators on a commercial basis and without subsidies; and expanding infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. The Economy and the Transport Sector                                        3&#13;
and facilities to meet demand in a cost effective way (an example is the recent public&#13;
offering of shares of Air Mauritius);&#13;
(iii) adequately maintaining facilities and infrastructure to reduce costs to operators&#13;
and to the administration or authorities in charge; and&#13;
(iv)   paying due attention to environmental costs such as air and water pollution, as&#13;
well as noise, through proper setting of engines, noise barriers and recycling of waste,&#13;
and, in addition, including in any project design, consideration of the need for&#13;
preservation of the national heritage of biodiversity, buildings, and protection of parks.&#13;
1.9   To meet demands of the transport sector and help realize these objectives, Mauritius&#13;
should: (i) improve access to and out of the Port-Louis urban area; (ii) improve the&#13;
performance of the sector parastatals, including MMA and CHC; (iii) increase productivity&#13;
and efficiency in port and airport operations. To that end, in the road subsector the&#13;
Government plans to ease congestion through a mixture of traffic management measures and&#13;
investment in possibly light rail and/or a ring road to bypass Port-Louis. For the airport, the&#13;
Government envisages a project including the extension of the runway. For the port, the&#13;
Government--with the proposed project--is seeking to reform port institutions, mechanize,&#13;
and increase transparency and efficiency in operations and extend facilities, in particular with a&#13;
new container terminal and ship-to-shore container cranes.&#13;
D. Previous Bank-Assisted Projects in the Environment and Transport Sectors&#13;
and Lessons Learned&#13;
1.10  In the past, the Bank has financed three projects in Mauritius' transport sector: a port&#13;
extension and modernization project at Port-Louis in 1974, and two highway projects in 1983&#13;
and 1989. At a total cost of US$13.6 million, the Port Project -Loans 976-MAS (1974) and&#13;
1339T-MAS (1976) provided financing for the current facilities at Port-Louis, including the&#13;
construction of three deep water berths. The project was successfully completed in March&#13;
1983.&#13;
1.11  The Highways Project--Ln. 2337-MAS (1983)--totaling US$15.2 million comprised&#13;
strengthening and improvement of 75 km of main roads, and strengthening of MOW's&#13;
functions. The project was completed, with its main objectives met, in June, 1989. The&#13;
Second Highway project--Ln. 3132-MAS (1989)--totaling US$30 million supported: the&#13;
strengthening and improvement of about 45 km of main roads; resurfacing of about 130 kln;&#13;
equipment for routine maintenance operation; traffic management; vehicle safety and emission&#13;
control; and consulting services and training. The project has been implemented satisfactorily&#13;
and will be closed at the end of June 1995, one year beyond the original closing date All&#13;
development objectives have been met and the overall rating for the project is 1 (one).&#13;
1.12 The Bank is financing an Environmental Monitoring and Development project (Loan&#13;
3277-MAS) which is seeking, inter alia, to develop a comprehensive framework of&#13;
environmental policy and an evolving legislation to provide Mauritius with a sustainable&#13;
program of continued development with adequate and appropriate environmental protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                               Mauritius: Port Development &amp; Environment Protection Project&#13;
The project also supports the establishment of a conservation program and management plan&#13;
for a maritime resource and monitoring program. The Environment Protection Act (1991)&#13;
places Mauritius at the forefront of Indian Ocean nations on matters of environmental&#13;
protection. The project implementation, initially delayed by the large number of institutions&#13;
affected, is satisfactory. The proposed project will build on the achievements in the field of&#13;
environmental protection.&#13;
1.13  The above projects' implementation was satisfactory as stated in completion reports.&#13;
Overall, Mauritius' implementation performance in its investment operations has traditionally&#13;
matched the high quality of its economic management. This success stemmed mainly from: (i)&#13;
good institutional capacity; (ii) strong ownership as a result of involving institutions at the&#13;
outset; and (iii) strong follow-up, once decisions were made. However, the focus of new&#13;
operations has become directed toward more complex institutional goals, often requiring for&#13;
their achievement the cooperation of various interest groups. This sometimes led to slow&#13;
preparation of projects and/or delayed start-up and slow disbursement. To enhance project&#13;
ownership and commitment of all stakeholders, the proposed project was prepared in close&#13;
cooperation with the GOM, MMA/CHC and MFA, and in consultation with relevant private&#13;
sector and trade union representatives. The project would focus specifically on strengthening&#13;
the capacity of MMA and MFA, increased transparency and efficiency in port operations&#13;
through structural change and expanded private sector involvement.&#13;
E. Rationale for the Bank's Involvement in the Sector&#13;
1.14  The focus of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Board on May&#13;
24, 1994, is to help Mauritius achieve and sustain a higher level of economic performance&#13;
based on increased competitiveness and diversification of production and exports, including&#13;
the development of skills-intensive and service-based activities. This requires, inter-alia,&#13;
improving the efficiency and competitiveness of key infrastructure, such as the port in an&#13;
environmentally sound manner. The proposed project would contribute to achieve this goal.&#13;
The Bank is already supporting Mauritius' drive to reach a higher level of performance, with&#13;
economic and sector work (Mauritius-Technology Strategy for Competitiveness, Report No.&#13;
12518-MAU, September 1994) and lending (Technical Assistance to Enhance&#13;
Competitiveness Project, Ln. 37360-MU, approved in May 1994).  A Services Sector&#13;
Modernization Project is in preparation. To broaden these efforts, the Government has&#13;
requested the Bank's assistance to support and guide the modernization and extension of the&#13;
port, and achieve the appropriate blend of institutional reform, capacity extension and financial&#13;
engineering. GOM, MMNIA and MFA prepared the proposed project with the Bank helping to&#13;
guide the process. This has generated broad-based support for the project, including its&#13;
institutional and managerial objectives, as well as its investment components. The proposed&#13;
environment component of the project is significant for its demonstration value for other&#13;
countries in the area of marine pollution and vessel safety control which is now being&#13;
examined in other neighboring islands for future possible GEF regional financing.  A&#13;
biodiversity conservation program for the restoration of habitats of endemic species was&#13;
analyzed for GEF financing as part of the proposed project and is being processed separately.&#13;

II. THE PORT AND FREEPORT SUB-SECTORS&#13;
A. The Port&#13;
Capacity and Shipping Activities&#13;
2.1   Port Facilities: The port of Port-Louis offers a maxunum draft of 12m and can&#13;
operate vessels up to 225m in length. During Fiscal Year 1994 (FY94), 794 vessels berthed&#13;
at Port-Louis (of which 312 were fully containerized, 114 were multipurpose container, and&#13;
195 were dry and liquid bulk carriers). The port's facilities include 10 berths, but only four&#13;
have the capacity to accommodate large vessels requiring a 12m draft. Berth occupancy&#13;
rates for January to April 1994 varied from 14% for the sugar berth to about 60% for&#13;
containers and other cargo berths, and 100% for the fishing berths.&#13;
2.2   Traffic and Capacity: Port traffic has increased steadily by 5% since 1979/80. During&#13;
FY94, traffic reached 3.4 million tons, two-thirds of which was bulk cargo (mainly oil, sugar,&#13;
rice and cement); of the remaining third (non-bulk), 75% was containerized. The chart below&#13;
shows the distribution of traffic per category for FY94, and the historical traffic trend is given&#13;
in Annex 5, Tables 1 &amp; 2.&#13;

ON Containers 25%&#13;
El Gen. Cargo 5%&#13;

* rates based on tonnage. Source: MMA&#13;
2.3   Container traffic has almost doubled over the past seven years, and reached about&#13;
96,000 TEUs in FY94, as seen in the chart below. Berths I to 4, where containerized cargo is&#13;
handled, have been operating at close to their maximum capacity since 1993. Although some&#13;
scope exists for productivity improvements and longer working hours, the present and&#13;
expected traffic volumes justify the construction of a new dedicated container terminal now.&#13;
Total traffic is projected to increase by 5% p.a. on average, container traffic increase would be&#13;
about 6% p.a., exceeding the current capacity of the facilities. Traffic volume projections are&#13;
in Annex 5, Tables 3 and 4.&#13;

2.4    Maritime Transport and the Fleet: At present, Mauritius is served by five liner&#13;
conferences. In addition to shipping companies that are members of the conferences, about 18&#13;
other shipping lines serve Mauritius' international trade, some of which operate feeder vessels.&#13;
The shipping policy emphasizes the promotion of international and regional trade, as a way to&#13;
generate foreign exchange and indirectly create employment. Inter-island shipping is being&#13;
served by a newly created, government-owned shipping line with a multipurpose ship, the&#13;
"Mauritius Pride". Mauritius' regulation of international shipping is largely unrestrictive.&#13;
Unlike countries that give priority to the national fleet, Mauritius has no flag or cargo sharing&#13;
requirements.&#13;
2.5    The control of cargo through customs in the port takes between only two to four days&#13;
and does not unreasonably delay the traffic flows. Customs processing of cargo is based on&#13;
the commonly used Sydonia system, which is now being supplemented by the latest Electronic&#13;
Trade Facilitation System (ETFS) to allow processing of ship manifests and customs&#13;
declarations before the arrival of vessels, to further speed-up custom processing.&#13;
MMA &amp; CHC - Organization, Management, and Staffing Issues&#13;
2.6    Mauritius Marine Authority (MAMA): The port is owned by the State and managed by&#13;
NMMA under the Ports Act of 1975. The primary role of MMA is the administration and&#13;
development of the whole port area, and operation of the commercial harbor through CHC.&#13;
NMA is governed by a Board of Directors representing the public and private sectors. The&#13;
Director General of MMA is appointed by the Board, subject to endorsement by the Minister&#13;
responsible for ports. The Director General is assisted by two Deputy Directors General, also&#13;
designated by the Board. Presently, MMA is organized in six departments and a secretariat&#13;
(Annex 5, Chart 1). MMA has a staff of 627 (January 1995) and is considered about 20%&#13;
overstaffed. Further, due to MMA's low wages (50% on average) compared with the private&#13;
sector, the rate of absenteeism is high (15 to 20%), and qualified staff are in short supply for&#13;
key functions such as piloting, marketing, cost accounting and legal counsel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. The Port and Freeport Sub-sectors                                         7&#13;
2.7   Cargo Handling Corporation (CHC) was created in 1983. Its shareholders are MMA&#13;
(40%) and the Government of Mauritius State Investment Corporation (60%), and it provides&#13;
cargo handling services at common user facilities (mostly for containers, other unitized cargo&#13;
and break bulk general cargo). CHC is headed by a General Manager who is appointed by the&#13;
Board. CHC is presently organized in five departments which need strengthening and&#13;
reorganization to meet future requirements (See Annex 5, Chart 4). With a staff of 1,150&#13;
(January 1994) CHC is about 40% overstaffed in relation to standard practices of more&#13;
efficient stevedoring companies. CHC was created to defuse tense relations between the port&#13;
labor and private port operators for many years before 1983. The operating practices of&#13;
CHC, since its creation, have resulted both in overstaffing and excessive wages due to the&#13;
systems of tour de role and piece rates that allow dockers to work an average of only 15 days&#13;
per month while earning more than private sector employees working a full month. As a&#13;
result, CHC's charges to port users are driven by its excessive labor costs.&#13;
2.8   Issues relating to port organization and management to be addressed by the proposed&#13;
project include: (i) the outdatedness of the Ports Act of 1975; (ii) the duplication of roles&#13;
between MMvA and CHC in controlling the same cargo, adding to the financial costs borne by&#13;
port users; (iii) the unclear definition of responsibilities between MMA and other entities&#13;
operating in the ports (such as the Central Electric Board (CEB), oil companies, or MFA),&#13;
causing lack of transparency and accountability in port operations; (iv) the need for a clearer&#13;
demarcation of the respective jurisdictions of the newly created Government agencies for&#13;
marine and coastal services; and (v) the lack of authority of MMA over the use of land within&#13;
the port area.&#13;
Port Operations and Issues&#13;
2.9   Port Operations and Maintenance: MMA provides satisfactory maritime services,&#13;
including piloting, tug service, and towage, and maintains the draft in the channel and berthing&#13;
areas. CHC provides handling services for general cargo traffic, mostly containerized or&#13;
unitized. Except for stevedoring, most of the equipment is used free of charge by CHC while&#13;
it is owned and maintained by MMA. Drivers for handling equipment are employed by MMA&#13;
while working for CHC. Private terminal operators handle major bulk cargoes (petroleum&#13;
products, cement, wheat and sugar) through specialized facilities; other bulk cargoes (coal,&#13;
fertilizer and maize) are handled by CHC.&#13;
2.10 Operational Performance: The less than optimal operating performance is due to the&#13;
absence of contractually agreed performance standards for handling operations, between&#13;
MMA/CHC. Operations are limited to a single 12 hour-day shift (except for container&#13;
vessels), in contrast to modern ports which work 24 hours with two or more shifts. The&#13;
absence of mechanization with ship-to-shore gantry cranes to handle containers also leads to&#13;
low productivity and costly operations. The handling of containers is slow, 5.5 TEUs per&#13;
hour and per gang, with a high 42% idle time, compared to a productivity of about 10 TEUs&#13;
per gang per hour in comparable ports. Though some progress has been made in recent years&#13;
(3 TEUs, 65% idle time in 1990), the productivity at Port-Louis remains sub-standard, and&#13;
improvements in both gang performance and working time are needed. These issues would be&#13;
addressed under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                Mauritius: Port Development &amp; Environment Protection Project&#13;
2.11 Private Sector Involvement: Private firms operate their own facilities for bulk traffic in&#13;
the port (sugar, flour, liquid ammonia, gas and oil, coal and cement).  Operational&#13;
performance of such firms is sound, except when the stevedoring is performed by CHC.&#13;
However, the relation between MMA and the private sector needs to be more explicitly&#13;
defined. Also, private sector operators do not operate under formal concession agreements&#13;
with MMA, and are therefore not compelled to observe norms for their operations, in&#13;
particular with respect to environment, security and safety. The proposed project would help&#13;
define and implement standards for concession contracts.&#13;
Port Finances, Tariffs and Issues&#13;
2.12 Financial Objectives, Tariffs and Costs: MMA's basic financial objective is to become&#13;
more commercial and efficient by fully recovering its costs, in order to service its debt and&#13;
yield a reasonable return on assets. MMA has actively pursued this objective. In the past,&#13;
MMA's large cash flows yielded substantial financial revenue from short-term investments,&#13;
and its current financial situation is very liquid. Separate tariff schedules are applicable by&#13;
MMA and CHC as is common practice in ports. MMA charges for the provision of port&#13;
infrastructure at berth and marine services, while CHC's charges relate to cargo handling&#13;
services (See Annex 5, Table 5).&#13;
2.13  MMA's tariffs have remained unchanged since 1983. Currently, total port charges&#13;
(NMMA and CHC combined) are on average 50% below tariffs of ports in the sub-region (Dar&#13;
Es Salaam, Mombasa) but compare unfavorably (40% higher) with more efficient ports&#13;
(Singapore, Maputo) for dry cargo (See Annex 5, Table 6.1). The high labor cost of CHC&#13;
impacts unfavorably on total port tariffs. Port charges are also affected by high operation and&#13;
maintenance costs, estimated at about 20% higher than normal practices. Currently, MMA's&#13;
tariffs for berth and marine services are about 35% below costs after the recent revaluation of&#13;
its assets (June 1993). However, as no cost accounting system exists at MIMA, tariffs are not&#13;
cost-based and cross-subsidies between services are difficult to assess.  Initial estimates&#13;
indicate that container and piloting dues are subsidizing other services by about 11 to 17%&#13;
(see Annex 5, Table 6.2). The project would improve MMA's financial management by&#13;
introducing: (i) a cost accounting system; (ii) appropriate revisions of tariff level and&#13;
structure; and (iii) cost containment measures and appropriate cost recovery for investment in&#13;
port land development. To lower cargo handling charges, a concession contract would be&#13;
established between CHC and MMA, to include phased-in reduction of labor costs and&#13;
improved gang performance.  Such performance indicators are included in Annex 4.&#13;
Indicators for equipment availability, staffing, and overall productivity (tons/employee/year)&#13;
are also given in Annex 4. Henceforth, CHC would lease or buy cargo handling equipment&#13;
now put at its disposal by MMA.&#13;
2.14  Accounting, Budget and Auditing: The budget of MMA is prepared annually and&#13;
includes an operations budget and a capital budget based on a three year rolling investment&#13;
program. MMA forecast revenue budget is prepared on the basis of actual traffic flow&#13;
adjusted by an estimated increase or decrease in traffic. The recurrent expenditure budget is&#13;
compiled by the Finance Department after consultation with other departments, but is not&#13;
based on any cost accounting analysis; a cost accounting system will be established by June&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. The Port and Freeport Sub-sectors                                               9&#13;
1996 under the project. MMvIA's financial statements are satisfactorily audited by private&#13;
auditors. The reports of such auditors (1990-1994) are unqualified.&#13;
B. The Freeport&#13;
Organization, Operations and Issues&#13;
2.15 Mauritius Freeport Authority (MFA): The Freeport Act of 1992 provides for the&#13;
establishment of freeport zones in Mauritius and for regulation of their operations. The&#13;
objectives of MFA are to control and manage a commercial freeport in various zones as&#13;
identified from time to time by ministerial regulation, license operators and provide&#13;
infrastructure, storage and ancillary facilities to private operators in these zones. Authorized&#13;
freeport activities are warehousing and storage, sorting, mixing, packing and repackaging,&#13;
minor processing and simple assembly, with exemption from customs and sales taxes. With&#13;
fewer than 10 employees, MFA is just starting its operations. Day-to-day management is the&#13;
responsibility of the Director General supervised by a Board of Directors including public and&#13;
private sector representatives. No development strategy is yet in place, while the staffing of&#13;
financial and information systems management also awaits completion. Issues to be addressed&#13;
include: (i) clarification of the relationship between MMA and MFA for the allocation of land&#13;
for freeport activities to be conducted in the port area; (ii) definition of land leasing rates&#13;
within port limits; and (iii) development of sea-air feeder services.&#13;
Finances&#13;
2.16  To date, MFA has obtained most of its resources from the Government to help finance&#13;
the development of its business, which started only two years ago. During this period,&#13;
Government has provided about Mau. Rs. 18.6 million for start up costs and equity&#13;
investment. NMFA seeks to be self sufficient through full recovery of its costs once it has&#13;
developed its business base. This is expected to happen by the year 2000, and by June 30 of&#13;
that year, GOM will consult with the Bank on the future development of freeport operations.&#13;
GOM is committed to the development of MFA to support its strategy to transform Mauritius&#13;
into a regional entrep6t trade center. The project would support this effort to afford MFA an&#13;
appropriate management framework and needed facilities to launch its activities. MFA's&#13;
financial statements are satisfactorily audited by private auditors. The reports of such auditors&#13;
are unqualified.&#13;
C. Port Environmental Issues&#13;
2.17 Marine Pollution: Mauritius' environment has been affected to some extent by the&#13;
activities of the maritime sector, particularly in the Port-Louis harbor and surrounding coastal&#13;
waters. Waste petroleum-oil from ships is dumped at sea regularly because of a lack of&#13;
reception, storage and disposal facilities. There is also a risk of accidental oil spills from&#13;
petroleum tankers as the Western Indian Ocean is a major crude oil transportation artery. An&#13;
estimated 450 million tons of oil per year are transported from the Middle East around the&#13;
Cape of Good Hope. The proposed project would help build capacity to cope with spills, and&#13;
a wider regional initiative is also under consideration for GEF funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                Mauritius: Port Development &amp; Environment Protection Project&#13;
2.18   Vessel Safety Control: Developed countries are enforcing strict maritime regulations;&#13;
developing countries, including Mauritius, could increasingly be served by sub-standard&#13;
vessels. Records of world shipping show an increase in ship-sinking, resulting in marine&#13;
pollution by hazardous chemicals. In 1993, of about 40,000 vessels that were inspected, more&#13;
than 10% were detained for non-compliance. The Vessel Safety Control gives a state&#13;
jurisdiction over foreign vessels for the purpose of enforcing internationally accepted&#13;
standards and safety codes. Such control is required to ensure adequate environmental&#13;
protection, covering discharges at sea, crew competence and crew/ship working conditions as&#13;
they enter a port. The project would help the Directorate of Shipping develop vessel safety&#13;
control.&#13;
2.19 Hazardous Oil and Gas Products: Oil and gas storage facilities are currently located&#13;
in the port main access area, and across a main city artery. This location poses a threat of&#13;
loss of the port's assets and nearby residential properties and lives in case of accidental fire&#13;
or explosion. The project would correct this by supporting the construction of a new oil&#13;
terminal in a safe location, the reclaimed area of Mer Rouge, for the relocation of the&#13;
storage facilities.&#13;
2.20 GOM has developed a comprehensive framework of environmental policy and an&#13;
enabling legislation that provides adequate and appropriate environment protection. GOM&#13;
has also developed a strategic agenda for port development and protection of the marine&#13;
environment in line with the Mauritius Environment Protection Act (1991), addressing&#13;
protection of its coastal as well as the region's waters. On October 14, 1994, GOM deposited&#13;
with the IMO the necessary legal instruments for accession to the International Convention for&#13;
the Prevention of Ship Pollution (MARPOL), the International Commission on Civil Liability&#13;
and Oil Pollution Damage, and the International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution&#13;
Damage. Mauritius is henceforth required to install facilities to accept and treat wastes from&#13;
ships that call at Port-Louis. GOM deposited the instrument of accession to the International&#13;
Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness Response and Cooperation (OPRC), too, which&#13;
aims to prepare for and respond to oil pollution incidents at the national and regional levels&#13;
through oil pollution emergency plans and national and regional preparedness and response&#13;
systems. To comply with OPRC, Mauritius must have adequate institutions, manpower and&#13;
equipment to enforce the existing National Oil Spill Contingency Plan, as well as limited&#13;
equipment to deal with accidental oil spills. The project would assist MMA and the&#13;
Directorate of Shipping in establishing such capacity.&#13;
D. Port Development Plan and Participation of Stakeholders&#13;
2.21  As part of the effort to diversify the economy, improve performance and strengthen&#13;
competitiveness, the Government approached the Bank for advice on bringing its port&#13;
operations to the cutting edge of competition, and developing the island into an attractive base&#13;
for maritime trade. Such a base could excel with port services quality, tariffs and incentives&#13;
attractive for business and trade transit through Mauritius. Such an objective requires a&#13;
2&#13;
Sumnuary of EIA in line with this Act for civil works of the proposed project is in Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11. The Port and Freeport Sub-sectors                                            11&#13;
revision of existing port sector policy, calling for a change from the state-run, limited gateway&#13;
to the local economy, towards a more dynamnic, market-oriented maritime business center.&#13;
2.22 To this end, the Government commissioned four studies, funded through a Japanese&#13;
grant, to prepare a project that would attain the twin goals of efficient services and&#13;
competitive rates in the country's port, through reform of port institutions and a larger role&#13;
for the private sector, including the promotion and protection of the environment: (i) Port&#13;
Policy, Institutional Strengthening and Pricing Study; (ii) Updating and Revision of the Port&#13;
Master Plan; (iii) Mauritius Freeport Development Strategy; and an Environmental&#13;
Safeguards Analysis to recommend measures where necessary, for businesses currently&#13;
operating in the port and future proposals made by the Master Plan Study.&#13;
2.23 The Government of Mauritius, MMA, CHC and MFA, with the Bank helping to guide&#13;
the process, prepared the proposed project in order to maximize beneficiary participation. All&#13;
the interested parties, including port users and labor unions, participated in the planning of the&#13;
institutional studies, as well as in the review of conclusions prior to their adoption by the&#13;
Government. This participation has generated broad-based support for the project's activities,&#13;
including its institutional and managerial objectives.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
3.1   The overall objective of the project, in line with the Bank's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy, is to enhance Mauritius' transport and trade competitiveness in the maritime sector,&#13;
in an environmentally sound manner. To this end, the project would help: (i) increase port&#13;
productivity, efficiency and capacity to meet the demand of port users and operators at&#13;
competitive rates through extension of facilities, mechanization and improved management of&#13;
MMA, CHC and MFA; (ii) re-define the role of MMA as a landlord port authority working&#13;
through a system of competitive concession contracts with performance indicators for port&#13;
operations; (iii) support the development of M1FA to promote Mauritius as an attractive tax-&#13;
free base for regional entrep6t trade; and (iv) accompany port development with sound&#13;
environmental protection, including control of marine pollution, and port operations and&#13;
vessels' safety enhancement.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.2   The proposed project, with a total estimated cost of US$100.2 million equivalent,&#13;
would include the following three parts:&#13;
Part A. Port Development (MMA) for US$89.3 million. This would include:&#13;
(i) institutional strengthening to make MMA a more commercially-oriented landlord port&#13;
authority, with sole legal authority over port operations, standards and land use, fostering&#13;
streamlined port handling operations through concession contracts with port operators,&#13;
including CHC; CHC would henceforth buy or lease cargo handling equipment put at its&#13;
disposal by MMA and would open its capital to private investors including an experienced&#13;
container terminal operator; (ii) improvement in the management and operations of MIMA and&#13;
CHC through the implementation of their corporate plans, including organizational&#13;
restructuring to achieve inter alia, cost containment, and rational marketing and pricing; CHC&#13;
would improve efficiency to meet specified indicators; (iii) construction of a new three berth&#13;
container and oil terminal, and procurement of related equipment including two gantry cranes&#13;
for container handling; fire-fighting and computer equipment; a passenger terminal building&#13;
and an internal road network for new port areas; civil works and pipelines to relocate oil and&#13;
gas storage; and (iv) supervision contracts (100 person/month) for civil works, and specialized&#13;
short-term assistance to develop and implement actions needed to strengthen the institutional&#13;
set-up, management and operations of MMA (30 person/month) and training (20&#13;
person/month).&#13;
Part B. Freeport Development (MFA) for US$8.9 million. This would include:&#13;
(i) a study on the modalities for liberalization of the national regime governing air transport&#13;
licensing, to allow for chartering of cargo planes to permit sea-air links, to facilitate sea-air&#13;
transshipment activities to take into account, reciprocity in international air traffic agreements;&#13;
(ii) implementation of a targeted trade development strategy through the execution of MFA's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. The Project                                                                                        13&#13;
corporate plan to strengthen its organization and operations as well as rationalize its&#13;
marketing and pricing; (iii) site preparation of 15 hectares of land at Mer Rouge including the&#13;
construction of roads and office and customs buildings; and (iv) supervision contracts (24&#13;
person-month) for civil works, and specialized short-term assistance to develop and&#13;
implement actions needed to strengthen management, operations and training at MFA (25&#13;
person-month).&#13;
Part C. Environment Protection for US$2. 0 million. This would include:&#13;
(i) a study (50 person-month) to define the requirements and to design facilities for collection&#13;
and disposal of land and ship-based oily waste, and to draft regulations required to enforce&#13;
safety in port operations and control vessels' sea-worthiness; (ii) construction of facilities for&#13;
collection and pre-treatment of oily waste, and (iii) supervision contracts (30 person-month)&#13;
for civil works and equipment and training (30 person-month) to fight oil spills and control&#13;
vessels' sea-worthiness.&#13;
C. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.3     Cost estimates for civil works are based on detailed engineering and unit prices for&#13;
similar, ongoing works in Mauritius. The estimated total cost of the proposed project is Mau.&#13;
Rs. 1,804 million, or US$100.2 million equivalent, including physical and price contingencies.&#13;
The foreign exchange cost amounts to Mau. Rs. 1,492 million, or US$82.9 million equivalent.&#13;

3.4    Physical contingencies applied to base costs have been estimated between 10%  and&#13;
15% for works, and 5% for equipment and services. Price contingencies for foreign costs&#13;
have been estimated at an annual 2.2% flat rate of increase from 1995 to 2001, and for local&#13;
costs at 7% in 1995, 6% in 1996, 4% in 1997 and beyond.&#13;
D. Financing Plan&#13;
3.5    The Government of Mauritius has requested the Bank (IBRD) to finance US$30.5&#13;
million as follows: (i) a Single Currency Loan (SCL) of US$23.4 million for civil works,&#13;
equipment, supervision contracts and specialized short term assistance for MMA (under the&#13;
Pilot Program  for SCL), to be funded jointly and in equal amount with the Accelerated&#13;
Cofinancing Facility from the Export-Import Bank of Japan (JExIm); and (ii) a Single&#13;
Currency Loan of US$7.1 million to the Republic of Mauritius for (a) onlending to MFA&#13;
(US$6.6 million), on the same terms as the Bank loan, for civil works, supervision contracts&#13;
and specialized short term  assistance; and (b) a grant to MMA (US$0.3 million) and the&#13;
Directorate of Shipping (US$0.2 million) of the Ministry of Trade and Shipping for the&#13;
environment protection component. The eligibility of MMA for a Single Currency Loan&#13;
(SCL) was confirmed during appraisal, as MMA is independently managed from Government,&#13;
has revenues denominated in US dollars, and manages its own currency risk. Conditions for&#13;
loan effectiveness would be: (i) for the loan to MMA, all conditions precedent to the initial&#13;
disbursement of the JExIm Loan, and (ii) for the loan to GOM (a) execution of the subsidiary&#13;
Loan Agreement for MFA, and (b) all conditions precedent to the initial disbursement of the&#13;
MMA loan.&#13;
3.6    Other sources of financing are: (i) a grant from the Government of Luxembourg for&#13;
US$1.0 million for technical assistance to MFA; (ii) a loan from the European Investment&#13;
Bank (EEB) for US$19.7 million for the two container gantry cranes and heavy yard handling&#13;
equipment, (iii) MMA and MFA, who would fund local costs of US$14.2 million and US$1.3&#13;
million, respectively, and (iv) the private sector for US$9.7 million for light yard handling&#13;
equipment and pipelines to relocate oil and gas pipeline relocation, as well as facilities for pre-&#13;
treatment of oily waste. The EIIB and private sector investments would be confirmed, or a&#13;
suitable alternative plan would be presented to the Bank by the Borrowers, within one year of&#13;
loan effectiveness.  GOM  and MMA would finance US$0.8 million for local costs of the&#13;
environment component.&#13;

III. The Project                                                              15&#13;
3.7   The use of a Single Currency Loan (SCL), especially for MMA, and the contemplated&#13;
private sector investment in the proposed project represent noteworthy innovations to&#13;
standard Bank financing arrangements in Africa, to date. By allowing a better exchange rate&#13;
risk management, the single-currency, US dollar-based loan offers significant value to MMA,&#13;
which earns most of its revenue in US dollars; the SCL's long termn 15-year maturity better&#13;
spreads the annual financing costs for MMA, compared to its short-term and higher-cost&#13;
alternative option. The same terms or better were secured for the project's cofinancing&#13;
arrangements (JExIm and EIB). The anticipated private sector equity financing of equipment&#13;
would reduce reliance on debt financing. Such financing sources include Mauritius' emerging&#13;
stock market, after revision of CHC's Memorandum of Association, thus furthering the capital&#13;
market-strengthening objective, consistent with an ongoing IFC project (Ln. 3699).&#13;
E. Implementation&#13;
3.8   The project would be carried out by MMA, MFA and the Directorate of Shipping.&#13;
MEPD would coordinate progress on institutional measures. Final engineering of the works&#13;
has been satisfactorily completed by consultants. Bids have been launched to minimize start&#13;
up delay and contracts are expected to be awarded in July 1995. Supervision of construction&#13;
would be carried out by local and foreign consultants. The project would be implemented in 6&#13;
years, completed by June 30, 2001, and closed by December 31, 2001.  A project&#13;
implementation schedule is presented in Annex 5, Chart 3.&#13;
3.9   Implementation of port sector reforms, which are key to attaining the project's overall&#13;
objective of increased efficiency and competitiveness in port operations, would require actions&#13;
on the part of both Government and the institutions concerned. Critical activities identified&#13;
below are part of project conditions agreed during negotiation; key performance indicators&#13;
to be monitored are in Annex 4.&#13;
3. 10  Institutional Framework Strengthening.   The Government of Mauritius has&#13;
satisfactorily finalized the following documents and measures to allow for transparency and&#13;
efficiency and private sector involvement:&#13;
(a) Statement of Port Sector Reform Policy (Annex 1), including timetables for (i) adoption&#13;
by GOM of the Port Master Plan and delegation to MMA of the authority to enforce such a&#13;
Master Plan; (ii) establishment of specific regulations for port environment and vessel safety&#13;
control and delegation to MMA of the authority to enforce such regulations; (iii) revision of&#13;
the Ports Act; (iv) adoption of corporate plans for MMA, CHC and MFA, including&#13;
quantitative performance targets and the establishment of a cost accounting system for MMA&#13;
and CHC; and (v) revision of CHC's Memorandum of Association.&#13;
(b) Revision of the Ports Act of 1975 incorporating such reforms to make MMA the sole legal&#13;
authority over port land use and setting of operations standards;&#13;
(c) revision of CHC's Memorandum of Association to gain access to private capital and&#13;
know-how. Such a revision would include provision for CHC to enter into a technical&#13;
arrangement with an experienced container terminal operator; and&#13;

3.17   MMvA  would  implement the Port Development Component and the related&#13;
procurement. This is the second port project, and MMA's staff has experience in project&#13;
management. Consultants were retained by MMA to prepare designs and bidding documents&#13;
and would supervise the terminal construction with a team satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Procurement capabilities of other agencies under the project, i.e., MFA and the Directorate of&#13;
Shipping, were found satisfactory. The main port contract would include provisions for price&#13;
adjustment over its two-year duration, and MMA would receive technical assistance under the&#13;
project to monitor and publish indices of construction inputs (labor, materials, and equipment&#13;
usage) on a regular basis. As the last Country Procurement Assessment Report took place in&#13;
1988, the borrower's procurement regulations and procedures have recently been reviewed by&#13;
Bank staff, and have been found acceptable.&#13;

3.18 During project implementation, award for Bank-financed works contracts above a&#13;
threshold of US$300,000 would be subject to the Bank's prior review. This will cover about&#13;
95 percent of the total works contract value procured by ICB and NCB (100 percent, ICB; 50&#13;
percent, NCB). Civil works contracts under US$300,000 and in an aggregate amount not&#13;
exceeding US$2.5 million of Bank financing would be awarded through NCB. All equipment&#13;
contracts above US$250,000 each, namely fire-fighting, office technology and computerized&#13;
yard management system equipment and spare parts, would be procured through ICB. Goods&#13;
contracts or packages above US$250,000 would also be subject to prior review, covering 100&#13;
percent of the total value of Bank-financed goods.&#13;
3.19 Consultant services financed by IBRD will be contracted on the basis of the World&#13;
Bank Consultant Guidelines (August 1981). The Guidelines require the Bank to review and&#13;
comment on each step by which the Borrowers select consulting firms, including: (i)&#13;
preparation of terms of reference and budget; (ii) choice of selection procedure; (iii)&#13;
preparation of shortlist (if not single source) and Letter of Invitation; (iv) submission of&#13;
winning proposal and evaluation report; (v) negotiated draft contract.&#13;
3.20  In accordance with IBRD Guidelines (January 1995), prior review thresholds have&#13;
been established for the procurement of services, per contract, at US$100,000 equivalent for&#13;
consulting firms, and US$50,000 equivalent for individuals. Below these thresholds, the Bank&#13;
conducts post review (1 in 5) of documentation for selected consultant contracts, but still&#13;
requires prior review of TORs, assignments of a critical nature (e.g. environment), single&#13;
source selection, and amendments bringing the total above the thresholds.&#13;
3.21  Procurement reporting to the Bank will be as follows:&#13;
(a)   contract award by the Borrowers;&#13;
(b)   quarterly reports indicating: (i) updated cost estimates for individual contracts and the&#13;
total project, including best estimates of allowances for physical and price contingency;&#13;
(ii) updated timning of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract&#13;
award, and completion time for individual contracts; (iii) compliance with aggregate&#13;
limits on specified methods of procurement&#13;
G. Disbursement&#13;
3.22  A schedule of estimated disbursements which takes into account the disbursement&#13;
profile for projects in Mauritius is given in Annex 5, Table 9.4. Disbursement from the loan&#13;
would cover:&#13;
(a)   for civil works: 50% of foreign expenditures* for MMA; and 100% of foreign&#13;
expenditures and 40% of local expenditures for GOM;&#13;
(b)   for equipment and spare parts: 50% of foreign expenditures* for MMA;&#13;
*&#13;
The other 50% of foreign expenditures will be disbursed from ACF, which will jointly finance all MMA&#13;
procurement contracts funded by the IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. The Project                                                             19&#13;
(c)   for consultant services: 50% of foreign expenditures* and 20%  of local&#13;
expenditures for MMA; and 100% of foreign expenditures and 50% of local&#13;
expenditures for GOM; and&#13;
(d)   for training: 50% of foreign expenditures* and 20% of local expenditure for&#13;
MMA; and 100% of foreign expenditures and 50% of local expenditures for&#13;
GOM.&#13;
Estimated Disbursements (in US$ million):&#13;

3.23  The minimum application amount for payments directly from the Loan Account or for&#13;
issuance of Special Commitments will be US$300,000 equivalent for MMA and US$100,000&#13;
equivalent for MFA. Disbursements will be fully documented except that withdrawals will be&#13;
made on the basis of SOEs for the items below:&#13;
- Civil works contracts valued at less than US$300,000 equivalent;&#13;
- Goods and equipment contracts valued at less than US$250,000 equivalent;&#13;
- Consulting firm contracts valued at less than US$100,000 equivalent, and individual&#13;
consultant contracts valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent;&#13;
- Local Training.&#13;
3.24  If requested by the Borrowers, and to facilitate disbursements against eligible&#13;
expenditures for small contracts of less than US$250,000 equivalent, two Special Accounts&#13;
(SAs) will be established in the name of MMA and MFA. The SAs will be opened and&#13;
maintained in a commercial bank, acceptable to the Bank, with an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$0.5 million for MFA and US$2.0 million for MMA, corresponding to about four months&#13;
of expenditures. Replenishment applications will be submitted at monthly intervals and will&#13;
include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;
H. Environmental and Social Impact&#13;
3.25  Environmental and Social Impacts.  The project is classified as Environment&#13;
Category B.  It builds on the achievement of the environment project on matters of&#13;
conservation monitoring and was prepared parallel to a biodiversity project to be presented&#13;
shortly for GEF financing. A specific Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried&#13;
out for the construction of the new container terminal, in accordance with the guidelines of&#13;
the Mauritius Environment Protection Act (1991). It concluded that the facilities would pose&#13;
no significant threat to the land and marine environment. The report has been approved by&#13;
Mauritius and an EIA license has been granted to MMA. This report is now public and has&#13;
been received by the Bank and forwarded to the Public Information Center (PIC). The civil&#13;
works would be executed in accordance with the provisions of the Mauritius Environment&#13;
Protection Act, and detailed design and contractual arrangements have been prepared to&#13;
comply with such provisions and the recommendations of the EIA on noise and other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                Mauritius: Port Development &amp; Environment Protection Project&#13;
potential works related disturbances. In addition, a study is being finalized to recommend&#13;
further specific improvement measures where needed, in the environmental safeguards of&#13;
businesses currently operating in the port. Further, the project will immediately address the&#13;
issue of the unsafe location and current operations by private oil companies of hazardous&#13;
goods--gasoline--by facilitating the relocation of such goods.  Finally, the environment&#13;
component of the project would bring the port of Port-Louis up-to-date with environmental&#13;
standards for ports (defined by international conventions such as MARPOL and OPRC),&#13;
including the establishment of the capacity for ship technical control for sea-worthiness and&#13;
safe disposal of oily waste to minimize pollution of coastal and international waters. MMA&#13;
would be granted the authority, and its staff trained, to enforce port safety regulations on&#13;
existing and future port operations. Hence, the project would contribute to enhancing the&#13;
implementation of Mauritius Environment Protection Act. The project would also have a&#13;
substantial and positive social impact by (i) providing more efficient and reliable conditions for&#13;
Mauritius trade, and (ii) helping indirectly to generate new business in the international trading&#13;
sector, thus securing and expanding employment.&#13;
1. Supervision, Monitoring, Reporting and Auditing&#13;
3.26  The Bank would devote some 84 staff weeks of supervision to the progress of the&#13;
loans through FY2001. During the first three years, supervision will focus on progress&#13;
towards achieving specific objectives such as works, implementation of corporate plans and&#13;
performance of implementation agencies. In the final three years, the emphasis will shift&#13;
towards evaluation of results and especially follow up to implement action plans. The scope&#13;
and timing of supervision are shown in Annex 3.&#13;
3.27  Overall project monitoring would be based on indicators set up in Annex 4 and the&#13;
implementation schedule shown in Annex 5, Chart 3. Monitoring would be carried out by&#13;
MEPD through a steering committee chaired by MEPD's Director, assisted by consultants as&#13;
necessary. Progress under each project investment component and action plan would be&#13;
monitored by MMA, MFA, and MOA/iMEQL, who would report to the steering committee.&#13;
Progress reports would be prepared every six months and be submitted to the Bank within one&#13;
month thereafter. An outline of the progress reports is given in Annex 3. No later than three&#13;
months after completion of the project, MEPD would prepare and furnish to the Bank a&#13;
report on the execution of the project, its costs and the benefits derived and to be derived&#13;
from it.&#13;
3.28  MMA and MFA would keep separate project accounts together with their statutory&#13;
financial statements. Terms of reference for the annual audits of the project accounts were&#13;
agreed at negotiations. Auditing will be carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, and the reports of such audits will be submitted to the Bank no later than six month&#13;
after the end of the fiscal year.&#13;

IV. Economnic Evaluation                                                           21&#13;
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A.    Forecast Traffic Demand&#13;
4.1    Port-Louis harbor traffic grew by 5.6%  p.a. over the period FY87-FY94, but&#13;
containerized traffic grew more rapidly than other cargo, at a rate of 10% p.a. The traffic&#13;
pattern of Mauritius is largely unbalanced between imports and exports. Of the total volume&#13;
of 3.4 million tons handled in FY94, imports comprised over two-thirds, of which 75% were&#13;
containerized. This imbalance generated a costly re-export of empties. Exports included&#13;
more bulk than containerized cargo.&#13;

4.2    Traffic Forecasts: Based on projected trends in population growth, levels of&#13;
consumption and production for exports, the total port traffic is estimated to continue to&#13;
grow at a rate of about 5% p.a. for the next 10 years, slightly slower than in previous&#13;
years. Containerized traffic growth is expected to slow down from 6.5 % in FY95 to 4.5%&#13;
in FY2000 (Annex 5, Table 4).&#13;

B. Operations Without and With the Project&#13;
4.3    Without the Project. The port of Port-Louis is constrained in its ability to unload&#13;
and load container vessels because of (i) the insufficient number of dedicated berths for&#13;
container vessels and (ii) the lack of container gantry cranes. As a result, container vessels&#13;
have to wait their turn to be serviced, and have to use their own gears to handle containers, at&#13;
an increasing cost. In addition, the stacking yard is adjacent to only two berths, and the&#13;
handling of container vessels at the other two berths requires a lot of land haulage. The&#13;
average quay occupancy rate (60%) is high, mainly due to the long time taken to handle&#13;
general cargo vessels that are often old and poorly equipped. Also, the rate of handling&#13;
container vessels is substandard (about 5.5 moves per hour per gang), though a few well-&#13;
equipped self-geared vessels have managed up to 16 moves per hour. Although container&#13;
vessels are given priority for docking, their average waiting time is likely to increase fast; the&#13;
number of ship waiting days was 212 days in 1994 and is estimated to reach over 500 days by&#13;
the year 2000, even with efficiency improvements to reduce dead time in gang operation.&#13;
4.4   The increase in bulk traffic (cement, coal, ammonia) would compete with the container&#13;
traffic. Berth number I would no longer be available for containers and Berth number 2&#13;
would be used for bulk part of the time. Liquid bulk (petroleum and gas) will continue to use&#13;
Berths 3 and 4 when the first two are not available. The growth of feeder vessels (if the&#13;
transshipment policy promoted by WFA is successful) would further constrain the use of&#13;
quays, and in larger proportion than the increase in volume handled, due to their lower&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
4.5    With the Project. The proposed project will make available three additional berths,&#13;
two exclusively for containers and one for petroleum tankers. The container terminal's&#13;
productivity will increase substantially with the operation of the proposed two new container&#13;
gantry cranes. Productivity is expected to reach over 25 moves per hour per crane; annual&#13;
port-days are expected to increase from 876 to 1359; operating costs for various vessels range&#13;
from US$6,650 to 12,670 (Annex 5, Tables 10, I1 and 12). Operation would start in early&#13;
1998 and all three berths are expected to be used at over 50% of capacity by the year 2005.&#13;
From the first year of operation, it is expected that all container liners and feeder vessels will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. Economic Evaluation                                                            23&#13;
be handled at the new terminal. Geared container vessels will no longer be handled at the&#13;
former terminal, and ships plying Indian Ocean routes are expected to become gradually&#13;
gearless.&#13;
C. Costs and Benefits Analysis&#13;
4.6    Costs and benefits of the container and oil termninal were evaluated at constant July&#13;
1994 prices. Financial cost estimates were converted to economic costs by excluding taxes,&#13;
duties and price contingencies. Costs include construction and related maintenance costs for&#13;
the 3 berths, stacking yard terminal, 2 container gantry cranes and 4 yard rubber tired&#13;
gantry cranes and related tractors and trailers, and front end lift trucks. Benefits include&#13;
cost savings attributable to reduction in: turn-around time for container and other vessels;&#13;
handling costs for containers (mainly management improvement and lower labor costs);&#13;
dead waiting time for cargo; and freight rates from the use of larger container vessels and&#13;
petroleum tankers. Additional benefits would result from reduction of double handling&#13;
between Berths I and 3 to reach the container stacking yard behind Berth 4 at a cost of about&#13;
1000 Mau. Rs. per container (US$50).&#13;
4.7   Savings in ship turn-around time and cargo time would benefit container traffic, as&#13;
well as bulk and general cargo. Indeed, the transfer of container handling to the new terminal&#13;
and of the petroleum and gas carriers to the new oil terminal would release space on Berths I&#13;
to 4. On those berths, areas will become available to handle other cargo like fisheries' cold&#13;
storage or rice in bulk. While MFA may later take advantage of these opportunities, such&#13;
benefits have not been quantified. Overall, the benefits would accrue to cargo shippers and&#13;
ship owners. With respect to container vessels, about 75% of benefits are estimated to be&#13;
passed on to Mauritian cargo owners, given the strong competition among shipping&#13;
companies. Most other cargo is carried on voyage charter ships chartered by Mauritians&#13;
(State Trading Corporation and major private companies) and benefits would accrue to the&#13;
Mauritian economy.&#13;
D. Overall Economic Evaluation, Sensitivity and Risks&#13;
4.8   Economic evaluation only applies to the new container/oil terminal which represents&#13;
90% of the project costs and is based on a comparison of projected costs and benefits. The&#13;
operational parameters used for the economic evaluation are given in Annex 5, Table 10.&#13;
The streams of costs and benefits are set out in Annex 5, Table 13. The estimated&#13;
economic rate of return (ERR) is 19%. The sensitivity of the return to variations in costs&#13;
and benefits (Annex 5, Table 14) is summarized below:&#13;
ERR (%)&#13;
Base case                                                             19&#13;
15% increase in costs (due to delays and/or price/quantities)        17&#13;
15% decrease in benefits (due to higher operating cost and lower demand)  17&#13;
Combined increase in costs and decrease in benefits by 15% each       16&#13;
4.9    A risk analysis was carried out to assess the probability of the worst case with a&#13;
simultaneous occurrence of cost increases and benefit reductions of 15%  each.  The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                Mauritius: Port Development &amp; Environment Protection Project&#13;
probability of getting the theoretical minimum rate of return of 15.6%, calculated in the&#13;
sensitivity analysis (Annex 5, Table 14) is almost nil. The simulation based on a normal&#13;
distribution law and 700 iterations, gives the spread of probability in obtaining an ERR&#13;
from below 16.5% (less that 5 % of cases) to above 20.5 % (25 % of cases; see Annex 5,&#13;
Table 15).&#13;
4.10 The results show that the project remains justified even with sizable variations in&#13;
project costs and benefits.  The assumptions used are conservative.  In addition, the&#13;
benefits of technical assistance have not been quantified; they include (i) a rationalized&#13;
utilization of port land based on an approved Port Master Plan, avoiding misuse of premium&#13;
land reclaimed from the sea; (ii) a more responsive service to private investors, operators and&#13;
port users; (iii) trade opportunities for the country generated by transshipment; and (iv) less&#13;
polluted port water, better handling of hazardous cargo and improved ship safety.&#13;
4.11  The main risks to the operation of the terminal would be in the event of exceptional&#13;
tropical storms, in which case some damage may be caused to: (i) berths; (ii) berths and&#13;
yard handling equipment; and (iii) containers. A special risk analysis has been carried out&#13;
to evaluate the probability and amplitude of maximum waves in such storms. The results&#13;
were used to calculate the design structure of the berths which is independent from the&#13;
structure supporting the gantry cranes. Safety measures from other similar islands prone to&#13;
tropical storms were used in the design (La R6union, and French West Indies ports).&#13;
Warning mechanisms and emergency procedures are already operational and would be&#13;
appropriate to mitigate this risk. Calculations of the economic return have taken into&#13;
account elements of risks, including: (i) the uncertainty with respect to the development of&#13;
transshipment operations likely to result from freeport activities; hence no traffic growth&#13;
was ascribed to transshipment traffic beyond its actual volume of about 2500 TEUs; and&#13;
(ii) the findings of a mathematical model analysis indicating that the new facilities would&#13;
not be available for short periods (48 hours) three to five times per year, due to tropical&#13;
storms.&#13;
E. Economic Assessment of MFA&#13;
4.12  The economic justification of MFA's proposed investment was examined and indicated&#13;
that the cost-benefit analysis of the proposed investment based on extemal benefits is&#13;
satisfactory with a return of about 20%. The extemal benefits were quantified in monetary&#13;
terms and include residual value of land, additional income for port and airport and direct&#13;
employment revenues. Additional revenues are expected to accrue to Mauritian traders, but&#13;
are not taken into account as too difficult to quantify accurately. Providing that MFA's&#13;
development attracts sufficient free port operators to occupy its facilities, revenues from the&#13;
project's investment would be able to cover all MFA's operational costs and gradually meet&#13;
interest and debt repayment by the year 2000 to phase-out Government financing (see para.&#13;
5.19). Based on Mauritius' history of prudent management, and GOM's commitment to&#13;
launch MFA, the project will support the initial phase of investment in site preparation to&#13;
facilitate investment in facilities. During the project, GOM would consult with the Bank, by&#13;
June 30, 2000, on the development of freeport operations.&#13;

5.2    MMA's past financial performance is characterized by a careful management of its cash&#13;
flow and leverage. Port operating revenues increased at an average annual rate of 9%&#13;
between FY 1990 and FY 1994 when they reached Mau. Rs. 247 million due to growth in&#13;
port traffic and the appreciation of the US dollar on which port tariffs are based. Port&#13;
operating margin was kept at about 50% of revenues while the cost of borrowing was&#13;
restricted to a maximum of 8% of revenues. This allowed MMA to accumulate cash reserves&#13;
of about Mau. Rs. 340 million (US$17 million equivalent) by 1994, which compares favorably&#13;
to most ports of the region.&#13;
5.3    MMA also maintained an appropriate depreciation policy to allow for periodic&#13;
maintenance and replacement of its assets . The return on net assets was as high as 39% in&#13;
1991 and maintained at about 20% through 1993. The debt to equity ratio was maintained at&#13;
a low level, 0.20. Finally, MMA employed qualified staff in its finance and administrative&#13;
department.&#13;
5.4    On the downside, MMA has not consistently managed all potential revenue sources&#13;
and associated costs. The cost of MMA's investment in cargo handling equipment (valued&#13;
approximately at Mau. Rs. 105 million) for which MMA maintains a repair unit, was not&#13;
recovered from Cargo Handling Corporation (CHC). Further, MMA has not been able to&#13;
benefit from leasing the valuable port land over which it currently has no right. In addition,&#13;
MMA's tariffs cannot be properly managed as their relationship to costs is unknown, due to&#13;
the lack of a cost management system. Finally, beginning in 1993, MMA embarked on a plan&#13;
to expand port facilities (under the proposed project) without adequately considering how to&#13;
match long term investments with long term borrowing. This led to a rapid decrease of its&#13;
cash reserve.&#13;
3&#13;
Revaluation of assets was done at the end of 1993 and will be carried out periodically as warranted by price&#13;
increases.&#13;

5.5    Under its initial plan of short/medium term borrowing, and without specific actions on&#13;
tariffs and costs, MMA's cash reserve would have been depleted by 1997 and its internally&#13;
generated funds4 would only cover one third its debt service requirements. MMA would have&#13;
been unable to meet its obligations from 1997 onwards (Chart 1 below).&#13;

5.6    The overall earning capacity of the port is also affected by the inefficiencies and the&#13;
high cost of the over-manned and mediocre performance of CHC (para. 2.7). This impacts&#13;
negatively on the port's image, volume of traffic and revenues, especially for non-captive&#13;
traffic. The distortions in the ports tariff structure are highlighted in Chapter II.&#13;
B. Future Financial Strategy and Projections&#13;
5.7    Financial Strategy: The financial strategy envisaged with the project would build upon&#13;
the strengths of MMA and support a program for improved cash flow management which&#13;
would help MMA remain self sustaining and competitive. Such a strategy would address (i)&#13;
management of borrowing cost (ii) enlarging the revenue base to include a cost recovery&#13;
policy for all assets in use including land, to yield reasonable cash flow to sustain operations&#13;
(See Chart 2 below). This program would also include (iii) costs and tariff management; and&#13;
(iv) institutional support to the finance and administration unit to build its capacity for future&#13;
financial planning and monitoring. This program would be implemented through a corporate&#13;
plan to be approved by the Board of Directors of MMA, including specific financial objectives&#13;
and covenants described in Section C hereafter. Similarly, a corporate plan would be&#13;
implemented by CHC as an integral part of developing the port's business practices towards a&#13;
4&#13;
Internal funds available for debt service are 60% of the annual accumulated cash flow; the remaining 40% is&#13;
allocated to urgent investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. Financial Analysis                                                                     27&#13;
more competitive and financially sound operation, and the performance indicators of this plan&#13;
(see Annex 4) would be embodied in a concession agreement.&#13;
5.8    Financial Forecasts: The cash flow illustrated by Chart 2 below indicate that if the&#13;
above components of the strategic plan are properly implemented, MMA's expected internally&#13;
generated funds would exceed its debt needs, even leaving a surplus to fund potential&#13;
investments. MMA's net cash position would at first significantly decrease from 1996 to Mau&#13;
Rs. 50 million by 1999 due both to service of the existing debts and the investment required to&#13;
extend port facilities (US$14 million to be contributed by MMA, representing about 20% of&#13;
the cost). However, the cash position would remain positive and steadily climb to its highest&#13;
projected level of Mau. Rs. 350 million by the year 2005.&#13;

5.9    The return on net assets would be initially about 2% up to 2001, then increase as port&#13;
traffic grows following modernization of its infrastructure, improvements in efficiency, and&#13;
revision of tariffs (see data below). It would reach 5% by 2005. The debt to equity ratio&#13;
would not exceed 1.5, which is satisfactory. The assumptions underlying these forecasts are&#13;
presented in Annex 5, Table 7.5.&#13;

C. Financial Objectives and Covenants&#13;
5.10 The financial management program envisaged for MMA to remain self sustaining and&#13;
competitive would include the elements described below to be made an integral part of a&#13;
corporate plan for the approval of the Board of Directors of MMA. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained to meet the following objectives and covenants:&#13;
5.11 Management of Borrowings and Currency Risk Exposure: Borrowing plans for&#13;
investments in port facilities would be presented each year by June 30, in a three year rolling&#13;
plan, acceptable to the Bank, and would match the nature of the assets and the sources of&#13;
funds. The financing plan for the proposed investment would seek long term loans, with an&#13;
appropriate grace period, to better match revenue generation and debt service. Currency risk&#13;
exposure would be reduced by matching foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.&#13;
5.12 Management of Tariffs: The current tariffs for port services are not related to the cost&#13;
of the services. MMA's tariffs are estimated at about 35% below its cost after revaluation of&#13;
assets; at the same time cross subsidies exist but cannot be properly ascertained (para. 2.13).&#13;
A cost accounting system tracing the cost of the various services, including depreciation and&#13;
the cost of capital and other common costs, and associated revenues, would be implemented&#13;
under the project, before June 30, 1996, to provide a full basis for costs recovery and yield a&#13;
reasonable cash flow to sustain operations. To this end: (a) tariffs for all services would be&#13;
revised from time to time. Current estimates for revisions are, on average not less than 15%&#13;
on June 30, 1996, to contribute to the cost of the planned extension works. Subsequently,&#13;
based on the revenues and costs analysis of the services, tariffs would be adjusted no later&#13;
than June 30, 1999, by not less than 8% on average. Tariffs would be revised regularly to: (i)&#13;
maintain their real value; and (ii) generate a reasonable return on net assets in use (estimated&#13;
at about Mau. Rs. 2.1 billion by the year 2000) of not less than 2% by the year 2000 to&#13;
contribute to future investments; (b) MMA's working expenses would not exceed 40% of&#13;
annual operating revenues by the year 2000 and thereafter; to this end, excessive maintenance&#13;
and labor costs would be reduced by at least 20% in 1998, and 10% in 2000; and (c) annual&#13;
long-term debt would not be higher than 1.5 times accumulated equity and reserves. Cargo&#13;
handling charges would be lowered through a phased reduction in labor cost and improved&#13;
gang performance to be specified in a concession contract between MMA and CHC. Such a&#13;
contract to be acceptable to the Bank, would be executed by December 31, 1996, and would&#13;
include performance indicators detailed in Annex 4.&#13;
5.13 Revenue Generation From All Assets in Use and Operating Cost Management: MMA&#13;
would price appropriately all port related services with full knowledge of their costs structure,&#13;
including land and rental values of properties. The cash flow generated annually as defined&#13;
above would be invested in financial and other equity assets through the local financial&#13;
markets, to at least prevent depletion from inflation. MIMA would be granted the authority to&#13;
benefit from the investment in developing the land in the port areas.&#13;
5&#13;
Intermediate steps to be monitored through the corporate plan would be: 50% (1996) and 45% (1998), see&#13;
Annex 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. Financial Analysis                                                                         29&#13;
D. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.14 Given its good record in managing operating costs, the two elements to which MMA's&#13;
financial performance would be particularly sensitive are revenue growth related to traffic&#13;
volume and tariff revisions. The sensitivity analysis in Annex 5, Table 7.4, highlights the&#13;
results of variations in revenues due to growth in the volume of traffic of 9%, 5% and 3%.&#13;
The financial covenants would require revisions of tariffs. Further, efficiency gains in gang&#13;
performance (See Annex 4, Performance Indicators) and reduction in costs (labor,&#13;
maintenance) are expected to benefit port users and thereby mitigate the effect of tariff&#13;
increases on ship owners.&#13;
5.15   Even the worst case scenario does not indicate a dramatic worsening of MMA's&#13;
financial position. Such a situation could occur if traffic increases are below 3%. The reforms&#13;
and efficiency measures included in the project would help mitigate this risk. In addition, the&#13;
forecasts were prepared using a lower revenue growth, 5% rather than the historical trend of&#13;
9%, and operating expenses were conservatively forecast.&#13;
THE MAURITIUS FREEPORT AUTHORITY (MFA)&#13;
A. Recent Financial Results&#13;
5.17           The data below  summarize the results of the first two years (1993-94) of&#13;
operations of MFA. MFA's main source of revenue is rental of infrastructure (land, storage&#13;
facilities, common areas, etc..) to private operators in freeport zones. This infrastructure is&#13;
currently in a development stage, so MFA generated about Mau. Rs. 2.8 million over the two&#13;
years for a total operating cost of about Mau. Rs. 12 million (Annex 5, Table 8.1). For these&#13;
two years, the Government provided Mau. Rs. 14.6 million representing the bulk of the&#13;
financing of the operations to support the development of MFA's business.&#13;

5.18   MFA is an autonomous entity and as such its ultimate financial objective is to be self-&#13;
sustainable, recovering the full costs of its business and yielding a reasonable return on its&#13;
investment. Because MFA is still to develop (see para. 2.16), GOM's support in covering&#13;
operating costs (exclusive of depreciation and interest) will be required up to FY 2000,&#13;
according to financial projections. Subsequently, MFA is expected to be self-sufficient. By&#13;
6&#13;
50,000 m2 of new facilities would be available from 1997.&#13;
&#13;

30                                 Mauritius: Port Development &amp; Environment Protection Project&#13;
June 30, 2000, GOM will consult with the Bank as to the future development of freeport&#13;
operations.&#13;
B. Financial Projections&#13;
5.19 The assumptions, by MFA (Annex 5, Table 8.3), underlying the financial projections&#13;
from 1995 to the year 2001 are detailed in Annex 5, Table 8.1 and 8.2. The financial&#13;
projections in the table above indicate that MFA would meet its initial target of self sufficiency&#13;
by the year 2000/2001 and become profitable thereafter with a return on investment of about&#13;
5% by 2005.&#13;
C. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
7&#13;
5.20  The projections for MFA would be most sensitive to the occupancy rate of the land .&#13;
MFA revenues are mainly from rental of properties (warehouses, storage, etc.) and license&#13;
fees. An increase in revenues depends on the number of freeport operators that MFA can&#13;
attract. As the first two years of operations do not provide sufficient reference, the project is&#13;
to assist the Government in launching this activity based on Mauritius' past good economic&#13;
management record.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations for MFA to limit&#13;
investments to providing common user areas (site preparation) only, and leave the&#13;
development and management of facilities (storage, buildings, etc.) to the private sector to&#13;
avoid a heavy debt burden. Government would monitor the development of MFA and consult&#13;
with the Bank; MFA has hired a qualified accountant and data processing expert to improve&#13;
its financial management; and rental fees for warehouses would be increased from time to time&#13;
to maintain commercial value, first before December 31, 1995, to a monthly rate of Mau. Rs.&#13;
7/feet2 in line with current market values.&#13;
7&#13;
A combined scenario of three rates (25%, 50% and 100%) is in Annex 5, Table 8. MFA intends to enter into&#13;
a joint venture with private investors to build warehouses, replacing rental revenues by its share of&#13;
potential earnings distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

VI. Benefits and Risks                                                        31&#13;
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
6.1   The economic rate of return for the new container and oil terminal (which represents&#13;
78% of total base costs) is estimated at 19%, but could vary from 17% to 16% under&#13;
different, risk-related assumptions.  By improving the competitiveness of the country's&#13;
transport and trade, the project would support the development of international and regional&#13;
entrep6t trade, both of which are crucial for continued rapid, sustainable growth of the&#13;
Mauritian economy. Transport costs would be lowered through reduced ship and cargo&#13;
waiting time. The port would benefit from better land use, in particular for prime areas&#13;
reclaimed from the sea. The regulatory roles and organization of MMA and MFA would be&#13;
strengthened to make both agencies more responsive to the needs of private investors and&#13;
operators. MMA and MFA are expected to generate satisfactory cash flow and returns on&#13;
investments under the project. The project would have a substantial and positive social&#13;
impact by (i) providing more efficient and reliable conditions for Mauritian trade, and (ii)&#13;
helping indirectly to generate new business in the international trading sector, thus expanding&#13;
employment.  The project would also help realize benefits in the form  of reduced&#13;
environmental risks, through less polluted port water, better handling of hazardous cargo, and&#13;
improved ship safety control.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.2   The project is subject to three risks: (i) possible partial implementation of the proposed&#13;
institutional changes, especially the labor redundancies at MMA and CHC; (ii) the effect of&#13;
the annual cyclonic storms on the operations of the new terminal; and (iii) especially for&#13;
MMA, the interest rate risk associated with a LIBOR-based SCL. The first risk has been&#13;
minimized through the use of client consultation and beneficiary participation.  All the&#13;
interested parties--the Government, MMA, CHC, port users and labor unions--participated in&#13;
the planning of the institutional studies, as well as in the review of conclusions prior to their&#13;
adoption by GOM. The second risk has been mitigated by analyzing the possibilities of&#13;
weather related loss and building the appropriate level of precaution into the design of the&#13;
berth to enable it to withstand waves of even exceptional storms. In addition, provisions have&#13;
been made to have gantry cranes secured to the ground, and yard equipment moved to safe&#13;
shelters during such storms. Also, a reasonable number of days of operations have been&#13;
deducted from benefits to take into account possible interruption of the port's operations on&#13;
such occasions. For the third risk, MIMIA is eligible for a SCL under the Bank Single&#13;
Currency Loan Pilot program. MMA's choice of a US dollar SCL will eliminate the foreign&#13;
exchange risk that it would have faced with currency pool loans. While the LIBOR-based&#13;
interest rate of the SCL is volatile and poses a risk, MIMA estimates that the benefits of&#13;
reduced currency risk the SCL affords outweigh the interest rate risk.&#13;
&#13;

Dear Mr Jaycox,&#13;
Port Sector Reform Policy Statement&#13;
We have been, for some time now, considering the implementation of a port&#13;
.expansion project and the reform of the: port sector to enhance productivity in ,: and improve&#13;
the intemational competitiveness of, the port of Port Louis as part: of efforts to stimulate'&#13;
intemational transport and trade and to promote economic diversirlcation. Discussions&#13;
have been held with the Bank for a financing package to implement the'project and to&#13;
reach a consensus on port sector reforms. The object of this letter is to Cdetailtout to'you&#13;
the specific measures which we intend to take to bring about the necessary changes -&#13;
institutional, legal and organisational - in the port sector and to seek your support in favour&#13;
of the proposed port development project.&#13;
Recent Economic Performance&#13;
2     As you are aware, Maunitius has enjoyed sustained growth for over a decade, with&#13;
the economy expanding at an average annual rate of'5. 7 per cent in the period 1983-1993.&#13;
Exports grew at a rate (16.9 per cent) faster than GOP to reach Rs 23,522 million in 1993,&#13;
per capita income rose to neafly USS 3,000 from about US$ 1,000 ten years- earlier and&#13;
unemployment dropped to less than 2 per cent of the labor force from the peak of 22 per&#13;
cent in the early 1980's. There has been a radical change in the structure of the economy,&#13;
with industry, in. particular the Export Processing Zone (EPZ), replacing sugar as the engine:&#13;
of growth. Underpinning this success are trade preferences, which Mauntian sugar and&#13;
industrial exports enjoy in the European and USA markets, and the availability of a large.&#13;
pool of inexpersive but generally literate labor-which gave the country a comparative&#13;
advantage in basically labor-intensive manufacturing products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Government Port Sector Reform Policy Statement                                    35&#13;
Constraints to Future Growth&#13;
3.    Maintaining the growth momentum  in the face of emerging challenges is a&#13;
formidable task for Govemment. Key issues impinging on our efforts to further expand&#13;
output and growth include labor and skill shortages (these are driving up wages and&#13;
production costs, thereby eroding the comparative advantage of our export products), low&#13;
labor productivity relative to what is obtained in countries. competing with us for export&#13;
markets, and the gradual erosion of trade preferences as a result of the opening up of our&#13;
traditional markets in the wake of the liberalization of international trade.   These&#13;
developments are threatening to undermine the ability of Mauritius to continue growing.on&#13;
the strength of established activities and underline the need for Govemment to identify new&#13;
sources of growth to further modernize the economy and to sustain continued increases in&#13;
income and employment.&#13;
Economic Diversification&#13;
4.    Widening further the economic base through diversification of the production&#13;
structure is the key aim of our development strategy. It lays.special emphasis on exploiting&#13;
the development potenrial of the financial services, off-shore business activities and:&#13;
intemational transport and trade activities, while consolidating the textile sub-sector of the&#13;
EPZ by moving up-market. Central to this strategy is the development of Mauritius as a&#13;
regional trade center to serve as a transit point for transshipment of goods between Europe&#13;
and Asia/Pacific and African countries. Towards this end, a commercial freeport has been&#13;
established to promote transshipment activities and re-exporft trade. The current economic&#13;
development strategy, including freeport arc' regional hub initiatives, need to be supported&#13;
by an adequate port policy designed to improve the performance and intemational&#13;
competitiveness of the Pcrt of Port Louis and to meet the demands of port users in an&#13;
optimal and timely manner&#13;
Port Policy Issues&#13;
5.    We commissioned in 1993, with the help of the Bank, studies to look at the various&#13;
aspects of port. operation to serve as a basis for the preparation of a Port Expansion&#13;
Project, including reform  of the port-sec'or policy.  The studies have identified severat&#13;
issues - institutional, organizational, operational and financial - requiring our urgent&#13;
attention. The key findings are as follows:&#13;
a.    Operational performance of the Mauritian Port is low relative to competing&#13;
ports in the region. Overmanning, low labor productivity, shortages of&#13;
qualified staff and significant time loss affect port productivity and&#13;
intemational competitiveness;&#13;
L.    Overlapping  responsibilities, in  particular between  MMA  and  other&#13;
Govemment agencies, are leading to duplication. There is a pressing need&#13;
to clarify relationships among, and hamnonize the roles and functions of, the&#13;
various bodies operating in the Port;&#13;
c.    MMA and CHC organizational structures as well as that of MFA, manifest&#13;
weaknesses.  These are having an impact on their performance and&#13;
efficiency;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                         Mauritius: Port Development &amp; Environment Protection Project&#13;
4d.    There are significant risks involved in the handling and storage of petroleum&#13;
products and LPG along with other dangerous cargo,. while the location of oif&#13;
tank farms in the middle of the Port constitutes a significant threat to life and&#13;
property, including the marine environment;&#13;
e.    Prime land in the Port area risks being allocated in a manner not consistent&#13;
with national priorities as there is no single body in the country withi&#13;
responsibility to allocate and oversee the use of land;&#13;
f.    CHC is almost entirely dependent on MMA for shore-handling equipment.&#13;
The Corporation is also undercapitalized. CHC should be given the means&#13;
necessary for it to become a full-fledged operator;&#13;
g.    MMA tariffs have remained unchanged since 1983. These will have to be&#13;
raised to enable MMA to improve its finances which are expected to come&#13;
under severe pressure as a result of borrowings to finance the proposed&#13;
container terminal project and other port development projects;.and&#13;
h.    Ship waste reception and treatment facilities are not available in the Port. As&#13;
a result, vessels discharge oily wastes in the sea, affecting the marine&#13;
environment and causing the pollution of intemational waters.&#13;
We subscribe to the need to reform the port sector in order to address the critical issues&#13;
impinging on port productivity and competitiveness. Details of the reform which we propose&#13;
to implement are discussed below:&#13;
Objectives of Port Policy&#13;
i6..;.   The port policy wiil be guided by the need to achieve the following major goals:&#13;
a.    Modemize the port infrastructure and mechanize port operations to the&#13;
extent possible;&#13;
b.    Promote efficiency in the provision of port services; and&#13;
C.    Provide port services at competitive rates.&#13;
The objective is to have a port which is modern, well equipped, efficiently operated,&#13;
proressionally managed and provides services at competitive rates.&#13;
Implementation of Port Policy&#13;
7     The policy with regard to the Port will be implemented through a supreme&#13;
consolidated port authority which can create the right environment, where all the various&#13;
parties concemed, including both public and private sector organizations, together with&#13;
users, unions, and other interests can effectively play their respective roles towards.fhe&#13;
provision of efficient and competitive port services. Govemment will ensure that they are alt&#13;
given the chance to operate in an integrated manner under the drive of MMA which wouJd:&#13;
regulate and control the various port activities and operations, while setting the price of porf&#13;
services or approving such other tariffs as appropriate.  The overall responsibili&amp; willi&#13;
therefore, rest with MMA as the national Port Authority vested with adequate powers to&#13;
effectively control all port activities and operations, port development and land useL within&#13;
the port boundaries. MMA will operate under the Ministry of Internal and Extemar&#13;
Communications which will oversee that the port policy is being property implemented.&#13;

8; T''-:Jhe'national port policy components shall include:&#13;
'.:.'.... Statutory policy&#13;
a.    the legal and regulatory frarneworks of the Port Authority, port&#13;
operators and port industry will be defined;&#13;
b.    the main port-sector functions between Govemment, the :Port&#13;
Authority and port operators will be allocated bearing in mind the&#13;
needs to safeguard national interes. and grant adequate autonomy. t&#13;
the Por. Authority;&#13;
*c.    the Port Authorty will establish conditions for the llcensing of port&#13;
operators. It will have powers to set tariffs for port services and&#13;
salaries and conditions of service;&#13;
d.    the Port Authority will have direct control overland-use policy.&#13;
Investment Policy&#13;
The Port Authority will have powers to implement projects identified in the&#13;
Port Master Plan.&#13;
.i.-   Financial and Tariff Policies&#13;
..The PortAuthority will be vested with powers to set financial objectives and&#13;
regulate tariff at competitive levels.&#13;
iv.:- Environment Policy&#13;
This, in line with the Mauritius Environment Protection Act (1991), will aim at.&#13;
responding to the need to have a sound port environment by:.&#13;
a.    delegation of authorfity to MMA, the Port Authority from. MEQL by&#13;
December 1995 to enforce environment guidelines/regulations in the.&#13;
port area;&#13;
b.    establishing regulations to control vessels safety-by December 1996;&#13;
c.    develooment of other necessary means to combat ship oily&#13;
waste and oil spill pollution.&#13;
v.    Managerial&#13;
MMA and CHC will both be fully commercialized to respond to commercial'&#13;
exigencies.&#13;
The'Rofe of Mauritius Marine Authority&#13;
-'S.. M'' MA will be the supreme National Port and Maritime Authority regulating the port&#13;
sector.,. Within the context of the port-sector reforms, Govemment will strengthen and:&#13;
consolidate the present functions and powers of MMA, including the functions of a tandlord.&#13;
port to ensure that the port sector is regulated, operated and controlled most professionally&#13;
and competitively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

10.   MMA will have all the functions, duties and responsibilities of a port authority. MMA&#13;
will be the sole agency to implement the national port policy, the guardian of the Port&#13;
Master Plan, once approved (expected before December 31, 1995), and Govemment's&#13;
adviser on port matters. Its main functions will be that of the port developer, regulator,&#13;
controller and coordinator. It will continue to be the provider of port infrastnucture and will&#13;
maintain a: regulatory and controlling arm. In the short term, it will be the provider of&#13;
-shore/yard equipment. It will continue to provide all marine services.&#13;
11.   MMA revised objects, functions and powers will be embodied in a revised Ports Act,.&#13;
the key principles of which have been adopted by Govemment (Attachment 1). It is&#13;
intended that the draft will be presented to Parliament by July 1996. Similarly,, the corporate&#13;
objectives, the strategy to accomplish these obiectives and the reorganization of MMA as&#13;
spelt out in a Corporate Plan will be adopted by MMA's Board by end-1995; the plan will&#13;
.cover the-next three years, (1996-98).&#13;
.12.  .. Government will give full support to MMA  in implementing the main port&#13;
-development and modemization projects identified in the revised Port Master Plan.&#13;
..The Role of Cargo Handling Corporation Ltd. (CHC)&#13;
1t3.: :0We support the pnnciple of CHC becoming a full-fledged port operator. The&#13;
transition will be in phases, as indicated in CHC Corporate Plan to be adopted by CHCs'&#13;
-Board by end-t 995 and will cover the following:&#13;
a.    CHC will be the sole port operator for containers, general cargo, and certain&#13;
bulk cargoes on existing facilities under a concession agreement with MMA&#13;
expected to be signed by December 31, 1996.&#13;
b.    CHC would acquire speciflic expertise in a technical arrangement with a&#13;
known container terminal operator, expected by December 31, 1996.&#13;
c.    Should CHC qualify for the New  Container Terminal, it will have total&#13;
r-esponsibility for handling operations from start to finish, i.e. stevedoring to&#13;
delivery and vice versa without MMA physical involvement. This will mean&#13;
no presence of MMA in sheds, container parks, open storage areas, on&#13;
quays, etc.&#13;
d.    MMA's role will be limited to regulatory, controlling and security functions (in&#13;
so far as handling is concerned); it will, however, retain gate control, au-ction&#13;
sales and cther legal responsibilities.&#13;
e.    Equipment: In the short and medium term, MMA will be the provider. A&#13;
proper formula will be worked out through which CLHC will have full&#13;
responsibility over the use/handling of its equipment which will be leased,.&#13;
starting December 31, 1996 or earlier.  To start operation of the new&#13;
container terminal, CHC will acquire handling equipment as needed.&#13;
f.    Workshop: Similarly, MMA workshop services will continue to be used for&#13;
repairs and maintenance of the equipment. However, MMA workshop will be&#13;
reorganized to operate on commercial lines, and respond to operational&#13;
exigencies promptly and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Government Port Sector Reform Policy Statement                                   39&#13;
The Role of Mauritius Freeport Authority (MFA)&#13;
14.   MFA  will be the agency of Government for the marketing, management,.&#13;
development and operation/regulation of free-trade zones, in particular those situated&#13;
within the port and airport boundaries.  It will have a complementary function to port&#13;
authorities and operators, with which it will work in close collaboration. MFA would be&#13;
instrumental in attracting regional trade and boosting transshipment traffic at Port Louis&#13;
Harbor.&#13;
15.   A study will be carried out starting in June 1996, on the prospect for liberalization of&#13;
the regime goveming air cargo traffic in Mauritius to permit the chartering of cargo planes&#13;
for sea/air and air/air transshipment of cargo.&#13;
The Role of Private Sector&#13;
16.   Present Position: The private sector is already substantially involved in the port&#13;
sector, both in terms of ownership of installations and operations. Concrete examples are&#13;
all the oil tank farms, fertilizer plant, flour mill and cement storage/packing facilities. The&#13;
private sector is directly involved in about 65% of the total cargo, mainly bulk, handled in&#13;
the port.&#13;
17.   Capital Increase of CHC Ltd: CHC will operate the new Container Terminal on&#13;
terms and conditions which will be specified in the concession contract to be signed with-&#13;
MMA eventually. CHC will operate on the highest standards of efficiency, whether on&#13;
manning, performance or handling charges. Should CHC fail to meet the performance,&#13;
quality and safety standards expected by MMA as the regulatory institution within the given.&#13;
time frame to qualify for the new container termina/, other altematives will be considered.&#13;
CHC capital will be opened up to 20% to MMAICHCl employees and/or to the public (&#13;
Attachment 2).&#13;
18.   Representation on MMA and CHC Boards: We will ensure that the pnivate sector,&#13;
in particular the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the shipping community, is&#13;
represented on the Boards of Directors of MMA and CHC so that the private sector is&#13;
actively involved in the development and operation o the Port.&#13;
19.   Establishment of Port User's Council: A Port User's Council will be established to&#13;
critically examine the adequacy, level and competitiveness of port facilities and services.&#13;
The Council will have a consultative role on issues like port development, tariff revision,&#13;
changes in documentation/procedures, etc.&#13;
20.   Communication with Port Ernployees and Other Interests: We will encourage&#13;
regular communication and consultation with port employees, trade unions, consumer&#13;
associations, business community and the media to ensure that alt parties play their&#13;
respective roles in a cohesive manner.&#13;
Land Pricing&#13;
21    All land in the Port will be properfy priced. Rentals will, to the extent possible, reflect&#13;
economic costs and current market values of land. Where short-term subsidization is&#13;
required, the extent of the subsidy will be clearly shown to ensure transparency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Environmental Protection&#13;
22    As a first step towards the ratification of MARPOL and OPRC, we will strengthen the.&#13;
capability of the Directorate of Shipping to enforce the Conventions.. Capacity for technicaf&#13;
inspection of vessels will also be established. Draft regulations for vessels safety control&#13;
will be prepared on the basis of a study to be carried out, before&lt;December 31, 19953.&#13;
Implementation of the regulations and training program for ship surveyors on technicat&#13;
inspections will start on March 31, 1996.&#13;
23.   A study will be carried out to determine the requirements for facilities whicth&#13;
Mauritius will have to install, as part of its obligations under MARPOL, for oily wastes from&#13;
ships and their treatment.&#13;
Port Tariffs&#13;
24.   Port tariffs, which have remained unchanged since 1983, will be cost-based and&#13;
,reviewed periodically and revised, as appropriate  To this end,:: MMA and CHC will&#13;
implement a cost accounting system starting earfy 1996 to trace their respective costs..of&#13;
services, including provision for depreciation, capital, operating expenses and associated&#13;
revenues.&#13;
Port Infrastructure Development&#13;
25.   in addition to policy reforms, Govemment will implement a project aimed at further&#13;
;expanding and developing port infrastructure. It will include, among others_, the following&#13;
.components:&#13;
a. Construction of three berths at Mer Rouge for new container and oil Terminals;&#13;
b. ConstrUction of container parks and related buildings;&#13;
c. Construction of intemal road network for new port areas in Mer Rouge; and&#13;
d.Acquisition of the necessary gantry cranes.&#13;
26.   To conclude, Government is fully committed to bring necessary reforms in the port&#13;
sector to improve overall port eff,Tciency through institutional and managerial strengthening,&#13;
commercializing and granting more autonomy to MMA and CHC.&#13;
27.   MMA will be the supreme National Port and Maritime Authority together with the&#13;
functions of a landlord pcrt. It will be the developer of port facilities and regulator/controller&#13;
of port activities, and the provider of marine services. All land in the port area, especially&#13;
land reclaimed, will be leased to MMA at nominal rates for own use or for subletting to other&#13;
port operators.&#13;
28.   Govemment wl71 give its full support to the development and modemization of port&#13;
facilities. The Ports Act will be amended within a set time frame to further strengthen and&#13;
consolidate MMA as shown in the Corporate Plan.&#13;
29.   Finally, CHC will be commercialized and established as a full-fledged port operator.&#13;
It will lease yard equipment from MMA. If CHC's capacity is demonstrated, CHC. will&#13;
operate the new Container Terminal under a concession contract which will specify&#13;
performance standards and tariffs level.&#13;

Annex 1: Govermnent Port Sector Reform Policy Statement                               41&#13;
30    The policy reform we intend to introduce is faifly comprehensive and covers almost&#13;
every aspect of port operation and management. The reform is crucial to bring about&#13;
improvements in port productivity and efficiency without which it wilt be diffrcult for fhe port&#13;
to remain competitive intemationally. We are convinced that our proposals are in line with&#13;
the Bank's assessment of policy reforms required in the port sector and that we can count&#13;
on your support for obtaining a loan for the proposed Port Devefopment and Environment&#13;
Protection Project.&#13;

MAURITIUS MARINE AUTHORITY&#13;
KEY ELEMENTS OF REVISION OF THE PORTS ACT, 1975&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
The Mauritius Marine Authority (MMA) was established in July 1976 under the Ports&#13;
Act, 1975, which Act was approved by Parliament in November 1997. There are also&#13;
several subsidiary lecislations which have been made under the main Ports Act,&#13;
namely:&#13;
(i)     Tne Ports (Charges, Dues &amp; Fees) Regulation, 1977, and subsequently&#13;
amended by the Port (Fees) Regulation, 1984, and The Port (Fees)&#13;
Regulations, 1985;&#13;
(ii)    The Port (Licences) Regulations, 1981;&#13;
(iii)   The Port (Operations) Regulations, 1987.&#13;
Furthermore, a series of other legislations have come up meanwhile, especially the&#13;
Merchant Shipping Ac:, the National Coast Guard, '1988, and the Mauritius Freeport&#13;
Authority Ac', 1992, which have some relationship with the port activities and&#13;
operations. Several IMO Conventions have also been ratifies by the Government.&#13;
Also, MMA has experienced several technical and operational inadequacies and&#13;
shortcomings in the Pcrt Legis!ation during its nearly 19 years of existence. As MMA&#13;
also has evolved considerably, it is felt that there is an urgent need to review the Ports&#13;
Act and related legislation, which all have to be updated to reflect the exigencies of&#13;
modern port operations and management.&#13;
The Consultants for the Port Policy, Institutional Strengthening and Pricing Study have&#13;
identified a series of amendments which are required in the present version of the Ports&#13;
Act.&#13;
This document outlines some of the sections which need to be amended. However,&#13;
these  may not be fully comprehensive, and  the services of a  part legal&#13;
experUconsul'ant will have to be retained to review completely the Ports Act, the&#13;
subsidiary legislations made under the Act, and other related legislation, and come up,&#13;
after discussions with all parties concerned including the State Law Office, with draft&#13;
proposals, including a draft Ports Act.&#13;
OUTLINE OF AMENDMENTS REQUIRED&#13;
1.    Obiects of the Authority&#13;
The statutory objects of the Authority should include the basic duties nd responsibilities&#13;
normally devolving upon a port authority. Thus the objects should clearly specify the&#13;
func.ions of a national port and maritime authority, including those of a landlord port,&#13;
adapted to the local context. Management policy would limit itself to regulatory and&#13;
controlling functions in cargo handling areas, and avoid direct involvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Government Port Sector Reform Policy Statement                            43&#13;
A realistic proposal is shown in the Appendix. Furthermore, it would be desirable to&#13;
have a section or a schedule dealing with detailed functions and powers of the&#13;
Authority.&#13;
2.    Composition of the Board&#13;
The composition of the Marine Board would be amended so as to include at least three&#13;
members from the private sector, e.g. the Chamber of Commerce, the Association of&#13;
Shipping Agents, etc.&#13;
Similarly the quorum of the Board, which is actually of 3 members, should be increased&#13;
to 5 to ensure more active and fruitful participation.&#13;
3.    Meetings of the Board&#13;
Section 6(a) provides for Board Meetings to be held at least once every month.&#13;
Assuming that with the proposed changes, the Authority's management will be fully&#13;
accountable with clearly set and defined powers together with specified responsibility&#13;
and performance targets, it is felt that the Act should not impose a monthly meeting,&#13;
althouch this may be practice. The Act should rather provide for meetincs at least on a&#13;
quarterly basis.&#13;
4.    Powers to enter in concession contract&#13;
Section 8(2) of the Act would be amended to give specific powers to the Authority to&#13;
enter into concession contracts with port operators and to set performance standards,&#13;
penalties in case of non-compliance or failing to perform, provision for suspension of&#13;
such contracts and bring in another party to intervene if necessary.&#13;
5.    Provision of Port Facilities&#13;
The Authority would legally be the sole organisation in the port area for the provision of&#13;
all marine and berthing facilities and associated infrastructures. This will enable better&#13;
coordination and rationalisation of all such facilities, and avoid wasterul duplication.&#13;
6.    Establishment of Port Users' Council&#13;
The Act would provide for the establishment of a Port Users' Council to discuss on the&#13;
adequacy, level and competitiveness of port facilities and services. the Council would&#13;
have consultative status on port development projects, tariffs levels and operational&#13;
matters.&#13;
7.    Financial Management&#13;
Sections 13, 14, 15 of the Ports Act would be amended tc allow the Authority to operate&#13;
on a commercial basis and to conduct its business in accordance with sound and&#13;
generally accepted business principles, and in such a manner to yield a fair and&#13;
reasonable return on the capital of the Authority.&#13;
Section 16 would also be amended to allow the Marine Board to have the flexibility of&#13;
investing surplus income in other port related commercial activities. This will enable&#13;
the Authority to diversify its sources of income as in the case of other modern ports.&#13;
The financial powers of the Director-General should be increased substantially.&#13;
&#13;

8.    Vestina of land&#13;
Government shall lease all state lands within the port limits to the Authority and hence&#13;
define port limits of Mauritius and its outer islands.&#13;
The Authority will control, regulate and lease such lands within the framework of the&#13;
approved Port Master Plan proposals.&#13;
9.    Tariff Setting&#13;
Even if under sections 10 and 1 1 of the present Act, give a certain degree of autonomy&#13;
to the Marine Board for the setting of salaries and conditions of service, the Authority&#13;
has up to now followed the pattern and trend of the Civil Service. However, in view of&#13;
the specificities of the port sector, the Marine Board will be given full powers to set&#13;
salaries and conditions of service according to prevailing market conditions.&#13;
11.   Navigation and other Business in Ports&#13;
The relevant sections under Part IV of the Ports Act should be amended so as:&#13;
(a)   to confer uoon the authority, broader powers as recards berthing and navigation&#13;
of vessels in any area within the Port limits;&#13;
(b)   to review the legal framework for the control of dangerous goods as defined by&#13;
the IDMG Code and associated activities within and adiacent to the Port limits;&#13;
(c)   to provide broader powers to deal with unsafe conditions created by immobilized&#13;
vessels, unattended vessels or refusal of vessels to clear harbour, under&#13;
directives; securing of vessels under arrest by a Court order"&#13;
(d)   to define responsibility of shipping agents in cases of unsettled debts;&#13;
(e)   to enable the Authority to withhold clearance of vessels under certain specific&#13;
circumstances, e.g. for non-payment of bills; damage to port infrastructure&#13;
and/or any other offence under the provisions of the Ports Act:&#13;
12.   Environmental Issues&#13;
The Authority would have control and enforcement powers on environmental issues&#13;
within the pore boundaries. Delegations will be given fromr the Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Quality of Life - under specific guidelines issued by them.&#13;
13.   Other Provisions&#13;
Similarly there are a series of other provisions which need review/updating and/or&#13;
amendments. These include: powers of seizure, destruction disposal of unclaimed&#13;
goods at ships' and/or consignees. costs, consolidation cf safety standards in line with&#13;
international recommendations; issue of hot or cold work permits, etc.&#13;

AMENDMENTS TO THE CORPORATION'S MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES&#13;
OF ASSOCIATION&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1    The Cargo Handling Corporation Ltd is a private company registered&#13;
under the Companies Act and incorporated in September 1983.  The&#13;
Corporation became operational on 1st October, 1983.&#13;
The authorised and issued share capital of the Corporation at the time of&#13;
incorporation was Rs 1 m divided into 10,000 shares of Rs 100/ - subscribed and&#13;
paid as follows:&#13;
Government of Mauritius&#13;
(through the State Investment&#13;
Corporation Ltd)                       6,000&#13;
Mauritius Marine Authority              4.000&#13;
Total shares                            10.000&#13;
The share capital Was increased to Rs 10 m in 1985 and the shares allotted to&#13;
the two shareholders in the same proportion.&#13;
AMENDMENT TO THE MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION&#13;
2.   Arzic!e 4.2 restricts the membership of the Company to:&#13;
(a)  the Government of Mauritius;&#13;
(b)  the Mauritius Marine Authority, and&#13;
(c)   a public sector organisation&#13;
This article would have to be altered to allow CHC to seek technical&#13;
arrangement with a known Terminal Container Operator to improve CHC&#13;
capabilities and know-how. The article would also allow to call for fresh capital&#13;
from various sources including capital markets and employees, in line with the&#13;
Company's requirements in handling equipment.  The alteration would be&#13;
effected at an extraordinary General Meeting which will be convened to open up&#13;
the capital base of CHC to private shareholding up to 20% of the total for CHC&#13;
employees and the public. This additional capital would help CHC to proceed&#13;
with the acquisition of its own fleet of yard equipment.&#13;

Annex 2: Summary of Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
1.    The new container terminal will be located at Mer Rouge, a site designated for industrial&#13;
and port related development in the Port-Louis Harbor Master Plan for Development: 1990 to&#13;
2010. For this project, no further dredging works are required. The Mer Rouge site is land&#13;
reclaimed from the sea very recently (reclamation completed in December 1990), and as such does&#13;
not appear to have any established flora or fauna.&#13;
2.    The elements that need to be taken into consideration in relation to the development of the&#13;
Mer Rouge site are: (a) currents and tides; (b) winds; (c) Terre Rouge Estuary; (d) Baie du&#13;
Tombeau Lagoon; and (e) the Northern Sea Outfall.&#13;
3.    The proposed container terminal facilities have been designed to satisfy criteria for a&#13;
modem terminal. A visual screen (e.g. of filao trees) is proposed to reduce any visual disturbance&#13;
for inhabitants of the northern bank of the Terre Rouge river and part of the Baie du Tombeau&#13;
residential area. The noise level should be within acceptable levels. Due to the open site and the&#13;
prevailing wind direction, air pollution will be much less than in any urban area. Surface runoffs&#13;
and wastewater disposal have been considered; the access road to the terminal does not form part&#13;
of the study.&#13;
4.    The conclusion is that the proposed container terminal facilities are unlikely to have any&#13;
major negative environmental impact on the landside. On the marine side, the dredging of the&#13;
channel and turning basin was completed by 1990, and no further dredging will be required in the&#13;
foreseeable future.&#13;

            Mauritius - Port Development and
            Environment Protection Project

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Mauritius
            Port Development and Environment Protection Project is to
            enhance Mauritius's transport and trade competitiveness
            in the maritime sector, in an environmentally sound manner.
            To this end, the project will help: 1) increase port
            productivity, efficiency and capacity to meet the demand of
            port users and operators at competitive rates through
            extension of facilities mechanization and improved
            management of the Mauritius Maritime Authority (MMA), Cargo
            Handling Corporation (CHC), and Mauritius Freeport Authority
            (MFA); 2) re-define the role of MMA as a landlord port
            authority working through a system of competitive concession
            contracts with performance indicators for port opertaions;
            3) support the development of MFA to promote Mauritius as an
            attractive tax-free base for regional entrepot trade; and 4)
            accompany port development with sound environmental
            protection, including control of maritime pollution, and
            port operations and vessels' safety enhancement.
