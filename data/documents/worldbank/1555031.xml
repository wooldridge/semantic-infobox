POVERTY AND THE DEVELOPIMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES: REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES&#13;
A BackRround Paper for World Development Report, 1980&#13;
This paper looks at human development in five regions: East Asia, South Asia, Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa. The treatment&#13;
varies with the special conditions in each region and the focus selected by each author.&#13;
Bussink treats human development as one strand in a wide-ranging discussion of&#13;
issues bearing on poverty in selected East Asian countries. Davies, after&#13;
presenting a broad overview of poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, focuses on selected&#13;
lhuman development issues (particularly in education): these include the relation&#13;
between higher and middle level manpower and institutional development on the one&#13;
hand and the human development of the poor on the other. Grawe emphasizes questions&#13;
of population growth and the status of women in South Asia and stresses the efficiency&#13;
of education and health systems, as well as reallocation of expenditures within human&#13;
development areas toward rore basic programs having a larger impact on the poor.&#13;
Kavalsky also pays attention to fertility and the large but narrowing disparity&#13;
between males and females (particularly in access to education) in the Middle East&#13;
and North Africa. A distinctive aspect of his study is the examination of the&#13;
effect of migration on poverty. He also illustrates how human development can lag&#13;
behind natural-resource-based income growth: that is, how human and institutional&#13;
development takes considerable time even where there are no serious financial&#13;
constraints, as in some of the oil-exporting countries of the region. Pfeffermann&#13;
focuses on some educational issues in Latin America and on the more general question&#13;
of the difficulty of reaching the poorest groups with human development programs.&#13;
The views expressed in these papers are not always those of the relevant regional&#13;
departments of the World Bank or of the World Development Report, 1980.&#13;

Summary&#13;
Five major countries in East and Southeast Asia - Indonesia, Korea,&#13;
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand - developed very rap-dly during the&#13;
1960s and 1970s. The paper contains reflections on the role of economic&#13;
growth and of specific policy interventions in the redressal of poverty. It&#13;
distinguishes four major poverty groups by their place in the economy and,&#13;
using the experience of the five countries over the two decades, discusses&#13;
the mechanisms through which their incomes have changed.&#13;
Broadly speaking, two factors appear to influence the position of&#13;
the poor most fundamentally. The first is the pressure of population growth&#13;
on land resources and on opportunities for employment. The second is the&#13;
speed and structure of economic growth, which largely determines the&#13;
resources available for investment and consumption as well as the demand for&#13;
labor. The two countries that were most successful in reducing poverty were&#13;
Thailand, where land was still available, and Korea, which had very rapid and&#13;
well-structured growth. Partly due to external circumstances, Indonesia and&#13;
Malaysia were not successful in reducing poverty in the 1960s, but the&#13;
situation improved markedly in 1970. Finally, in the Philippines, where good&#13;
land was scarce and growth not well-structured, little progress was made in&#13;
the alleviation of poverty.&#13;
Considering the generally favorable international economy during&#13;
most of the period under review, and the fact that land is now also becoming&#13;
scarce in Thailand, this mixed result is no cause for complacency. To make&#13;
maximum use of further opportunities to reduce p'overty, the author urges the&#13;
countries to adopt development strategies that fully integrate poverty con-&#13;
cerns into their data collection and policy formulation efforts. The Bank&#13;
could provide substantial analytical support, provided that it made the&#13;
resources available.&#13;
This paper reflects several years of shared work experiences and&#13;
many discussions with Bank colleagues - in the East Asia Regional office&#13;
and elsewhere - as well as government officials. The interpretations and&#13;
conclusions are however the author's own.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.  introduction and Outline&#13;
When the Bank first started to focus on poverty in the early 1970s, it&#13;
emphasized that the benefits of growth were not "trickling down" to the poor&#13;
and that a direct attack on poverty was necessary.     Since then, it has become&#13;
clear that Lhis approach has its own limitations and that the problem of&#13;
poverty and its alleviations in multiEaceted.&#13;
Over the last several years, a substantial amount work has been done on&#13;
poverty in five major countries in the East and Southeast Asia:      Indonesia,.&#13;
Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. The experiences of these&#13;
large, economically fast-growing, and relatively successful countries deserve&#13;
close examination to see the extent to which their poor have benefited from&#13;
growth and the accompanying increase in public services.     For, if poverty&#13;
persists in those five, what can be expected of other, less-favored&#13;
countries?&#13;
In the course of this review, it became clear that the methodology used&#13;
in the analysis of poverty is still open to many questions. Data were&#13;
scarce and difficult to interpret, especially with regard to changes over&#13;
time. While some progress has been made in "counting" the poor, little is&#13;
known about their links to the economy and much less about the socioeconomic&#13;
processes that determine whether the poor benefit or lose in the process of&#13;
economic growth and change. This paper contains some reflections on&#13;
interrelations between socioeconomic development and poverty in these five&#13;
East Asian countries and develops a framework for analysis of these&#13;
processes. It is hoped this discussion lays the analytical basis for the&#13;
integration of antipoverty policies into the individual countries' overall&#13;
development strategies.&#13;
Because none of the five countries have followed the "welfare first"&#13;
strategy as exemplified by Sri Lanka, no fundamentally different approaches&#13;
to development are compared in this paper. It focuses mainly on the ways&#13;
economic development and public policies have influenced the welfare of the&#13;
poor, not so much on the contributions of improved welfare and human&#13;
resource development to economic growth. An attempt is made, however, to&#13;
indicate briefly which policy interventions in the areas of human resource&#13;
and basic needs may be vital for the welfare of the poor.&#13;
An essential area outside the scope of this is the political, cultural&#13;
and institutional background to socioeconomic policy in general and to the&#13;
alleviation of poverty in particular. This subject would need separate&#13;
treatment if only because of the tremendous cultural diversity between the&#13;
five countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
There are major regional differences within two of the countries studied,&#13;
between Java and the other islands in Indonesia and between Peninsular and&#13;
East Malaysia. The area which contain the bulk of the population have been&#13;
given primary attention.&#13;
Distilling broad lessons from the many studies of poverty and related&#13;
subjects in East Asia has not been easy. The main sources were country&#13;
studies in the Basic Report series, employment reports on Thailand and&#13;
Indonesia, and poverty reports (some still in preparation) on Thailand,&#13;
Malaysia, and the Philippines /1.&#13;
The further layout of the paper is as follows.    Section 2 sets the&#13;
stage for the discussion of poverty in a general socioeconomic context. It&#13;
describes natural and human resources and major socioeconomic development&#13;
trends in the five countries without attempting to explain these trends.&#13;
Its main objective is to point out the macroeconomic and sectoral develop-&#13;
ments that have been important for the poor. Section 3 discusses social&#13;
development and poverty and attempts to draw poverty lines that allow&#13;
comparisons between the five countries and discusses the incidences of&#13;
poverty thus defined.&#13;
The second part of the paper reflects on the relation between socio-&#13;
economic development and poverty. Section 4 distinguishes four major poverty&#13;
groups, their place in the economy, and personal aspects of poverty. It&#13;
then develops a framework for the analytical description of relations&#13;
between economic development and poverty, emphasizing agricultural&#13;
development and labor market mechanisms. Using that framework, Section 5&#13;
presents brief analytical descriptions of the main developments in each&#13;
country during the 1960s and most of the 1970s /2. Finally, Section 6&#13;
formulatesl the main conclusions on the matters raised in the paper and some&#13;
related issues.&#13;
2. Resources and Growth&#13;
Our investigation of interrelationships between socioeconomic development&#13;
and poverty begins with an analysis of the economic base. On which natural&#13;
have the five countries been able to draw for their development? What have&#13;
the demographic developments been -- human assets as well as numbers of&#13;
mouths to feed? What manmade resources have been mobilized, and how&#13;
1. It has not been possible to incorporate systematically the information&#13;
available in project reports. This remains a task to be undertaken if&#13;
integrated antipoverty strategies are to be formulated.&#13;
2. For the final years of the 1970s, data are still incomplete.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
efficiently have they been used, to further growth or increase the welfare&#13;
of the population directly? Finally, how fast has been growth and how has&#13;
it been structured?&#13;
Land Resources&#13;
The five countries consist mainly of islands and peninsulas skirting the&#13;
Eurasian Continent. Table 1 describes their physical and demographic&#13;
characteristics. Korea, with its relatively small size and location well&#13;
outside the tropics, has geographically little in common with the other four&#13;
countries. Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand are each as large in&#13;
area as the major West European countries. Indonesia's land mass is about&#13;
the same size as all of Western Europe, and its islands are spaced over an&#13;
area as large as the United States.&#13;
The large size of these countries does not imply that land resources are&#13;
ample. Four of the countries lie mainly in the tropical rain and monsoon&#13;
belt, and their soils have been leached in many places.      In addition, much&#13;
of the land is either mountainous or swampy. The major fertile areas are&#13;
those where volcanic activity persists (as in Java and some other parts of&#13;
Indonesia) or where the mostly short rivers have created alluvial deposits.&#13;
The carrying capacity of these soils has over time often been enhanced by&#13;
irrigation, and even before the population explosion following World War II,&#13;
they tended to be densely populated. This situation applies particularly to&#13;
Java and Korea, where land availability per capita has become extremely&#13;
small. Through overextension of the cultivated area erosion is occuring,&#13;
especially in Java.&#13;
Where the above conditions do not apply but the climate is monsoonal,&#13;
as in most of Thailand and the Philippines, soil fertility is mostly&#13;
moderate. Annual rainfed cropping is possible, albeit often with strict&#13;
limitations because of the short duration of the rainy season. Substantial&#13;
amounts of land per person are necessary to provide adequate incomes.      Over&#13;
the last two decades, large remaining tracts of land of this type have been&#13;
developed in Thailand and, to a lesser extent, also in the Philippines.&#13;
Existing resources have, however, dwindled rapidly.&#13;
In the tropical rain belt of Malaysia and the main large islands of&#13;
Indonesia, leaching is so strong that annual cropping is problematic in most&#13;
areas. Traditionally shifting cultivation has often been practiced,&#13;
sometimes followed by attempts to replace the original forest by more&#13;
"productive" tree crops or by mixed farming under the cover of fruit and&#13;
other trees. Alternatively, estates have been created by foreigners. Again,&#13;
a high land-man ratio is needed and is indeed used, according to the scant&#13;
and sometimes contradictory information available (Table 1) /1.     However,&#13;
1. The tables begin on page 39. I suspect that land availability per head&#13;
in Indonesia's "Other Islands" is larger than the figures indicate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
reserves of the better lands have fallen, and development of the poorer&#13;
lands often demands substantial capital investment or outside support (as in&#13;
Indonesia and Malaysia) /2. In summary, as a result of the tremendous growth&#13;
in population since World War II, the land base in the five countries appears&#13;
precarious or rapidly approaching that state.    Changes in land availability&#13;
have major implications for poverty and its alleviation, as we shall see.&#13;
Other Natural Resources&#13;
Some of these five countries are popularly believed to be rich in natural&#13;
resources, such as minerals and forestry. Table 1 shows that, on a per&#13;
capita basis and excepting petroleum, this description fits only Malaysia,&#13;
which exports large amounts of tin and forestry products.    In the Philippines,&#13;
for example, the already modest natural-resource-based exports per capita&#13;
were halved in the 1970s.&#13;
Petroleum, one of Indonesia's traditional exports, made a net contri-&#13;
bution of only about 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) to that&#13;
country's economy in 1970. During the 1970s, Indonesia's production expanded&#13;
and then stabilized, and Malaysia became a significant producer, surpassing&#13;
Indonesia more and more on a per capita basis. After costs and foreign&#13;
factor payments, about two-thirds of the price per barrel accrues to the&#13;
producer countries. By 1977, this implied per capita net production values&#13;
of US$40-50 a year in 1977 for both countries. By 1979, given higher prices&#13;
and, in Malaysia's case, expanded production, too, the corresponding values&#13;
had reached about $70 per capita for Indonesia and more than $100 for&#13;
Malaysia. Clearly, the availability of these resources has been important&#13;
to both countries, but especially to Indonesia, with its low per capita&#13;
income.&#13;
In contrast to the other natural-resource-based sectors, oil revenues&#13;
accrue almost entirely to the public sector, which is not necessarily the&#13;
government. These revenues can therefore benefit the mass of the population&#13;
only indirectly, to the extent that they enable government to keep taxes&#13;
low, to increase expenditures that expand employment and incomes, or to&#13;
provide additional services. Unlike petroleum exploitation, other natural-&#13;
resource-based activities create at least some employment and benefit the&#13;
government.&#13;
Population&#13;
The five countries are ethnically and linguistically diverse, exception for&#13;
Korea. All have significant Chinese minorities, largely concentrated in urban&#13;
2. This need has been enhanced by the fall in the real price of rubber (and&#13;
to a smaller extent also copra) in the 1960s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
areas and identified with private business. The indigenous population's&#13;
resentment of this minority's economic power has limited government's power&#13;
to stimulate the private sector, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia.&#13;
Korea, the Philippines and Thailand had roughly equal populations of&#13;
about 26 million each in 1960. Java alone had more than twice as many, and&#13;
the "other islands" of Indonesia had 33 million. Malaysia had 8 million. As&#13;
elsewhere in the developing world, by historical standards population growth&#13;
has been extremely rapid in recent decades, and this has had major implica-&#13;
tions for poverty and its alleviation. The populations of the five countries&#13;
have not, however, grown equally rapidly (Table 1). Between 1960 and 1977,&#13;
the three "fast" growers, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, increased&#13;
their populations by 60-70 percent, the two "slow" growers, by less than 50&#13;
percent.   Basically, the rapid best differentiated growth occurred beca4se&#13;
all countries but Korea had high (though toward the end declining) fertility&#13;
while all but Indonesia had attained low mortality.&#13;
Changes in the number of births and in the number of adolescents reveal&#13;
demographic dynamics more clearly than overall population growth figures.&#13;
Here, the crucial group is the one entering the labor market and reaching&#13;
childbearing age. With regard to births, fertility levels in all countries&#13;
were high in the second half of the 1950s. Over the next decade, as Table 1&#13;
shows, the entry of the small war cohorts in the reproductive age groups&#13;
kept the growth in births down in Indonesia and Korea /3.     In Korea, the&#13;
effect was reinforced by a drop in fertility, and the absolute number of&#13;
births fell. By 1977 the large cohorts of the late 1950s were entering&#13;
their reproductive age, but fertility had fallen substantially in all&#13;
countries, and the two effects roughly compensated each other. Recent&#13;
projections for all the countries but Indonesia point to the continuance of&#13;
this trend so that the period of very rapid growth in each successive age&#13;
cohort seems to have ended in East Asia /4. This has major short-term&#13;
implications for dependency ratios and education needs, and long-term&#13;
implications for overall population growth.&#13;
The movements in the population entering working age follow those in&#13;
the number of births by a lag of 15 to 20 years. In addition, a continued&#13;
fall in mortality increases the adult cohort size even with a constant level&#13;
3. The small growth of the number of births in Malaysia is probably related&#13;
to out-migration by the fertile cohorts.&#13;
4. In Indonesia, the number of births is expected to continue to increase&#13;
at the (much reduced) rate of about 1 percent a year in the 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of births /5. Thus, in 1985 in all countries but Korea, the 15-19 age cohort&#13;
will be as much as 30-50 percent larger than in 1975. In Korea, the size of&#13;
this cohort will stop growing, although the total population and labor force&#13;
will continue to increase for another 50 years, an illustration of the long&#13;
time fertility changes need to work themselves through. The comparison&#13;
between Korea and the other countries in the region clearly shows the&#13;
tremendous impact that its early fertility decline has had, first on&#13;
dependency rates, then on the relative cost of education, and finally on the&#13;
number of new jobs needed, factors all closely linked to the redressal of&#13;
poverty.&#13;
Resource Mobilization and Use&#13;
Starting from a low level of development and per capita income in 1960, all&#13;
countries have made impressive progress. Table 2 shows that, compared to&#13;
present-day levels, investment rates in all countries were moderate to low&#13;
in the beginning of the 1960s. Korea's investments were fully financed by a&#13;
large resource deficit, while Malaysia ran a large resource surplus./6&#13;
During the 1960s, all the countries increased their investment rates; Korea&#13;
did so spectacularly. By 1970 Korea and Thailand were investing more than&#13;
a quarter of their gross domestic product (GDP), with the other countries&#13;
lagging by five to ten percentage points. During the 1970s, the latter&#13;
countries' investment rates continued to increase. The Philippines attained&#13;
the high rate of 30 percent in 1977 /7, while Indonesia and Malaysia, the&#13;
poorest and the richest countries respectively, remained at the lower end of&#13;
the scale.&#13;
Public revenue availability has limited the governments' ability to&#13;
provide economic and social services.  Revenues were low in the early 1960s&#13;
(10-13 percent of GDP) and have increased only slowly in the Philippines and&#13;
Thailand. In Indonesia, though boosted by large oil revenues, total public&#13;
5. Comparing two countries with life expectations at birth of 60 and 50&#13;
years, respectively, the number of survivors till age 25 will be 14 percent&#13;
larger in the first country.&#13;
6. Thailand's investment rate is probably understated, as the data specifi-&#13;
cally exclude substantial private investments in land development. For&#13;
Malaysia, not all the years show as large surpluses as were attained in the&#13;
reference years in Table 2.  It should also be noted that Malaysia's&#13;
factor payments were relatively large at about 4 percent of GDP.&#13;
7. According to the Kravis study on purchasing power comparisons, investment&#13;
ment goods are relatively expensive in the Philippines, so that the "real"&#13;
investment rate, in comparison to the other countries, is lower than the&#13;
figures indicate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
revenues remain well under 20 percent of GDP. Korea has substantially&#13;
increased public revenues, more to replace foreign assistance than to&#13;
increase its public expenditures, which were already substantial in 1960.&#13;
Malaysia, with its highly monetized economy based on extensive natural&#13;
resources and high export-to-GDP ratio, has traditionally raised substantial&#13;
public revenues.   With the recent addition of oil revenues, the Malaysian&#13;
public sector commands more than 35 percent of GDP.&#13;
Public expenditures have generally risen with revenues.     Partly financed&#13;
by foreign aid (to the public sector), public spending tends to surpass&#13;
revenues by 10-30 percent (except, recently, in Korea).     The three non-oil&#13;
countries now have public expenditures amounting to 16-20 percent of GDP and&#13;
show a remarkable similarity in expenditure patterns, about 4 percent of GDP&#13;
for social and economic services each. Malaysia is the exception, devoting&#13;
more than twice the average proportion of GDP allocated in the other&#13;
countries to each major category of expenditure.&#13;
Production and Income Growth&#13;
Table 3 summarizes the main data on production and incomes. Together&#13;
with Table 2, it shows that the relationship between investment levels and&#13;
GDP-growth has been close within and between the five countries. Investment&#13;
has accelerated simultaneously with growth instead of preceding it. During&#13;
the 1960s, both Thailand and Korea far out-performed the others in GDP&#13;
growth. The Philippines and Malaysia showed lower but respectable growth&#13;
rates, but Indonesia's economy suffered from mismanagement and upheaval. In&#13;
the 1960s, however, the prices of rubber and some other primary exports&#13;
plummeted in a major structural shift, lowering real income in Malaysia and,&#13;
less acutely, in Indonesia and Thailand /8. Translating from production&#13;
into real income, Malaysia's growth was halved in per capita terms /9. Thus,&#13;
in terms of growth of real incomes per capita in the 1960s, the five countries&#13;
fall into two groups:   the rapid growers - Korea and Thailand - and the&#13;
relatively slow growers - Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The&#13;
fast growers outpaced the others in raising their growth rates of not only&#13;
per capita private consumption but also of investment and public revenues&#13;
thus creating favorable conditions for further growth.&#13;
A review of the 1970-77 period along the same lines shows greatly&#13;
improved results in Indonesia and Malaysia.    Both countries reaped benefits&#13;
from the real price increase of petroleum as well as from their own improved&#13;
8.  Table 3 traces movements in international trade and real incomes.     These&#13;
figures should be interpreted cautiously, due to severe problems of measure-&#13;
ment and weight.&#13;
9. This is just an arithmetical comparison. Of course, reduced real income&#13;
growth also had multiplier effects on the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
and more ambitious economic policies. Their growth rates for private&#13;
consumption jumped dramatically, and their investment rates increased.&#13;
Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand, though suffer from rising energy&#13;
prices, increased their average rates of investment. As a result, GDP&#13;
annual growth rates expanded to more than 10 percent in Korea and 6 percent&#13;
in the Philippines. Korea, using accelerated growth to close its foreign&#13;
resource gap, and the Philippines, using it to increase its investment ate,&#13;
held their yearly growth rates of per capita consumption to the 1960s levels&#13;
- 5 percent in Korea, less than 2 percent in the Philippines. Finally, the&#13;
1970-77 period was less favorable for Thailand where the growth rates of&#13;
production, income, and consumption all declined slightly.&#13;
Before turning to the specific influences of these macro developments on&#13;
the poor, some important general factors can be brought, out. First, in all&#13;
countries and periods, production, real incomes, and consumption increased&#13;
more rapidly than population. Nowhere, but in Indonesia in the early 1960s,&#13;
were these results obtained by mortgaging the future by reducing investments&#13;
or government services. While these similarities are important, more&#13;
important still are the dissimilarities, best exemplified by the large&#13;
differentials in the growth rates of private consumption per capita. As&#13;
shown in Table 3, counting five countries over two periods, in 4 instances&#13;
out of 10 the annual growth rate of private consumption was only 1-2 percent,&#13;
but in another 4 it approached or exceeded 5 percent. In the low-growth&#13;
countries, only a small lag behind average growth rates would cause the&#13;
consumption of the poor to stagnate. Conversely, in the countries with high&#13;
average consumption growth, consumption of the poor would stagnate only if&#13;
it lagged far behind. An important question to be explored later in the paper&#13;
then becomes whether such lags are related to the growth rate and if so, how?&#13;
Put in terms of the quality of growth, this question would be: to what&#13;
extent did the pattern of growth benefit the poor? The answer lies partly in&#13;
sectoral emphasis. Because most poverty is rural in East Asia, as elsewhere,&#13;
agriculture is an important sector. In this context, it should be noted that&#13;
the growth rate of agricultural GDP has exceeded 4 percent a year in all&#13;
countries in both decades (with the exception of Indonesia in the 1960s).&#13;
This has been a remarkable achievement. Still, the agricultural growth&#13;
rates lagged well behind the overall rate of economic development. Conse-&#13;
quently, unless compensated by improvements in the domestic terms of trade&#13;
or by relative movements of the population out of agriculture, agricultural&#13;
incomes would tend to fall in relation to the average. The figures in Table 3&#13;
appear to confirm this /10.&#13;
10. The pattern in the Philippines deviates from the general one. The&#13;
relatively low agricultural GDP per worker in Thailand probably stems in&#13;
part from the highly seasonal nature of Thai agriculture and the consequently&#13;
higher than "normal" number of seasonal workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
The manufacturing sector is important for the poor largely through its&#13;
employment potential, as determined by its size and labor intensity.&#13;
Nominally, the Philippines started with the most developed manufacturing&#13;
sector (20 percent of GDP in 1960), but this share was and remains inflated&#13;
by high protection.   Korea and Thailand ranked next, at 12 percent.     Over the&#13;
entire period 1960-77, Korea sustained the astonishing annual manufacturing&#13;
growth rate of 17 percent.   Thailand and Malaysia also showed good but slower&#13;
growth in manufacturing.   Sluggish in the 1960s, the performance of&#13;
manufacturing in the Philippines and Indonesia also improved subsequently.&#13;
In very general terms, manufacturing's labor intensity tends to be&#13;
correlated with its export orientation. In the early 1960s, the five&#13;
countries exported scarcely any manufactures at all. Malaysia, with the&#13;
smallest domestic market, sold manufactures abroad at the rate of $5 per&#13;
capita a year; the Philippines and Korea, at the annual rate of $1.      From&#13;
the figures in Table 3, in 1976 Korea emerges as the only country with a&#13;
clear export orientation for its manufactures, followed at a great distance&#13;
by Malaysia. Despite their recent rapid growth, Thailand and the Philippines&#13;
still exported few manufactures; Indonesia, none.     These differences have&#13;
had substantial consequences for the poor.&#13;
3. Quality of Life and Incidence of Poverty&#13;
To what extent have the masses in these five East Asian countries benefited&#13;
from the rapid economic advances? The answer to this question can be&#13;
approached from two angles: the quality of life and the incidence of&#13;
poverty.&#13;
Quality of Life&#13;
There is no doubt that the quality of life for broad segments of the popula-&#13;
tion has improved markedly these five East Asian countries in the last two&#13;
decades.   Table 4 indicates the main accomplishments in this area.     Perhaps&#13;
most telling is the improvement in life expectancy by 7 to 10 years in every&#13;
country.  A life expectancy of 60 years or mDre had been reached by 1977 in&#13;
all countries but Indonesia. Indonesia again excepted, their life&#13;
expectancies were longer than could be expected on the basis of their per&#13;
capita incomes. Indonesia's lag indicates the difficulty of putting added&#13;
petroleum revenues to work quickly to satisfy such basic needs.as health&#13;
care. In input-oriented health indicators, such as medical personnel, Korea&#13;
and Malaysia lead the less wealthy countries, and they also have the highest&#13;
life expectancies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
In education, primary enrollment is complete in Korea and the&#13;
Philippines, and close to it in Malaysia. Indonesia and Thailand lag&#13;
somewhat behind but even in these countries primary enrollment of girls&#13;
surpasses 80 percent. Where enrollment is less than complete, some&#13;
differences remains between the sexes, but in comparison to other regions it&#13;
is not severe. In Korea, secondary enrollment has more than tripled and is&#13;
close to universal, while in the Philippines, it surpasses 50 percent.&#13;
Elsewhere, the secondary enrollment ratios have at least doubled between&#13;
1960 and 1977, but they have not yet caught up with the two leaders.&#13;
Adult literacy made great strides between 1960 and 1977. Even in&#13;
Indonesia, the literacy figure exceeds 60 percent.   In Malaysia literacy&#13;
rates are not commensurate with per capita income. In that country, the low&#13;
literacy rate combined with the high enrollment rate for at least 15 years&#13;
raises questions about the quality of education in the past.&#13;
The five countries have made spectacular advances in population control.&#13;
From a slow start in the late 1960s or early 1970s, a state has now been&#13;
reached where between 20 percent (Indonesia and the Philippines) and 45&#13;
percent (Korea) of married women use contraceptives. The birth rate per&#13;
fertile woman and the total fertility rate (number of births per woman&#13;
completing her fertile period) have fallen concomitantly.. The benefits of&#13;
this momentous change, both from a national and from an individual&#13;
household's point of view, have been briefly discussed in Chapter 2.&#13;
Poverty and Its Incidence&#13;
One weakness of the quality of life indicators is that they apply to the&#13;
population at large, so, for instance, there are no separate life expectancy&#13;
estimates for less-advantaged groups in the population. Changes in those&#13;
groups' circumstances are better reflected by trends in the incidence of&#13;
poverty. Poverty is an income-related concept, and to the extent that&#13;
income can be spent to satisfy many different needs, it is a good measure of&#13;
general welfare. Also, since our definition of poverty is linked to the&#13;
satisfaction of dietary needs, and nutrition is a major determinant of&#13;
health, the poverty concept incorporates an important element of the quality&#13;
of life approach.&#13;
However, the assessment of the incidence of poverty and its trends is&#13;
beset with many conceptual and measurement problems. These are discussed in&#13;
some detail in Appendix A. In summary, a few of the major problems are:&#13;
The Bank employs a poverty line concept based on caloric needs. These,&#13;
however, show wide variations between persons of the same age and sex and&#13;
even for the same person at different times. Caloric needs are also&#13;
ambiguous if a person has been malnourished in the past and therefore has&#13;
not realized his or her physical genetic potential.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*    When aggregated over households, personal income and expenditure&#13;
estimates, the basis for poverty lines and incidences, differ substantially&#13;
from National Accounts data. Those surveys also measure household rather&#13;
than individual incomes and even if household incomes are converted to a per&#13;
capita basis, differentials in needs related to age/sex composition and size&#13;
of the household are seldom taken into account.&#13;
*    There are major difficulties in assessing differences in quality in&#13;
the different groups' consumption baskets.    There is also not enough&#13;
detailed information on rural-urban and regional price differences.      For&#13;
dependable assessments of geographical variations in real incomes.&#13;
-    Surveys measure incomes only over a limited discrete time period, when&#13;
these incomes are subject to incidental, stochastic and life-cycle factors&#13;
(aside from measurement errors). As a result, the surveys cannot distinguish&#13;
between the temporarily and permanently poor, for instance /1.&#13;
*    All these difficulties and potential biases are magnified when&#13;
successive surveys are compared to establish trends in real incomes and the&#13;
incidence of poverty over time.&#13;
In view of these problems and reservations, all the works on poverty&#13;
needs to be interpreted cautiously, and to the extent possible, supplemented&#13;
by other information and careful judgment. Generally, it appears that the&#13;
application of the Bank methodology exaggerates the problem of absolute&#13;
poverty; also real income is probably distrib'uted more evenly around the&#13;
poverty line than is suggested by the survey data on per capita household&#13;
income.&#13;
Appendix B describes and interprets work done on poverty lines in East&#13;
Asia and adjusts these lines to allow broad comparisons between countries.&#13;
In Table 5, corrected poverty lines are called "formal" poverty lines because&#13;
they are based on the Bank's formal methodology. If taken at face value,&#13;
these lines would, however, denote an extraordinarily high incidence of&#13;
poverty (43-80 percent in rural areas) everywhere but in Korea. This&#13;
picture conflicts with life expectancy and other data. The quantitative&#13;
results thus confirm the doubts expressed about the methodology.&#13;
At the present stage of knowledge, corrections can be based only on&#13;
judgment. In this vein, I have set "informal" poverty lines at two-thirds&#13;
the formal ones.   In my judgment, considering the available information on&#13;
1. To mitigate this distortion, instead of using income as a gauge, household&#13;
expenditures, which are less influenced by temporary changes, could serve as&#13;
a basis for assessment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
mortality and nutrition, these informal poverty lines probably give a&#13;
reasonable indication of the incomes needed to avoid significant malnutri-&#13;
tion. The lower poverty lines could then be interpreted as defining&#13;
"definite" poverty, and people with incomes between the two poverty lines&#13;
would be in "marginal" poverty. In any case, in view of all the unanswered&#13;
questions raised earlier, these poverty lines can only be used to estimate&#13;
poverty at the national level, not to identify individual poverty households.&#13;
Given a poverty line, two factors determine the overall incidence of&#13;
poverty in a' country. The first is the per capita availability of consumer&#13;
goods, in relation to the amount indicated by the poverty line. The second&#13;
is the division of these goods among consumers. Table 5 indicates the&#13;
ratio between the (informal) poverty lines and the level of per capita&#13;
consumption. Since this indicator does not reflect differences in the&#13;
availability of consumer goods between urban and rural areas, it cannot be&#13;
used for urban-rural comparisons within countries. Comparing the rural&#13;
situations between the countries, the relation between the incidence of&#13;
poverty and the availability of consumer goods seems close, with countries&#13;
where land has been available (Thailand and Indonesia's other islands) having&#13;
a low incidence of poverty. The single exception to the relation between the&#13;
availability of consumer goods and the incidence of poverty in rural areas&#13;
is Korea, where the second factor equality of incomes plays an important&#13;
role /2. Comparing urban areas in the various countries, the incidence of&#13;
poverty appears to be even more clearly related to overall affluence in&#13;
terms of the availability of consumer goods than was the case in rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
Comparing incidences of poverty across countries, Java is in the worst&#13;
poverty situation of the five countries. Second come the Philippines, which,&#13;
according to these figures, have a more severe poverty problem than&#13;
Indonesia's other islands. On average, the rural areas in Indonesia's other&#13;
islands appear to be better-off than Malaysia, but this is partly due to&#13;
wide variations in affluence within these large islands. At first somewhat&#13;
surprising but understandable in view of its low food prices, Thailand's&#13;
incidence of poverty is lowest of the four southern countries. Finally,&#13;
Korea, according to the not very reliable figures presented here (which do,&#13;
however, seem to conform with general impressions) has done well in rural&#13;
areas but less well in cities.&#13;
2. The data on poverty incidence in Korea, based as they are on a household&#13;
income distribution, are however particularly suspect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
For reasons explained earlier in this section, poverty trends are more&#13;
elusive than poverty levels.   The Bank's broad assessments in various reports&#13;
are also summarized in Table 5. During the 1960s, only Korea and Thailand&#13;
seem to have made progress in alleviating poverty, but in the 1970s all but&#13;
the Philippines did. The countries and periods in which no headway was made&#13;
against poverty are the same ones in which growth in per capita income and&#13;
consumption were very limited (Table 3). Thus, as elsewhere, it appears to&#13;
have been difficult in East Asia to ameliorate the situation of the poor&#13;
unless the economy grew rapidly.&#13;
4. Aspects and Determinants of Poverty&#13;
Poverty thus persists in East Asia despite the unquestionable economic and&#13;
social gains of the past two decades. In the next two sections, an attempt&#13;
is made to identify the main groups of people living in poverty and to&#13;
develop a framework for the analysis of the existence and persistence of&#13;
poverty. This framework is then applied to each of the five countries.&#13;
A Typology of Poverty&#13;
Four major poverty groups can be distinguished. With urbanization limited&#13;
in all the countries but Korea, the two main poverty groups live in rural&#13;
areas. The first group consists of people cultivating poor, rainfed soils,&#13;
most but not all of them practicing subsistence agriculture. In the initial&#13;
stages of settlement, such land is not scarce, and labor is the limiting&#13;
factor in the peak season, which is often brief. This type of poverty&#13;
is usually regional in character: most people of the area are poor, and&#13;
their incomes do not show wide variation. Because most of these areas are&#13;
sparsely populated, economic and social infrastructure are expensive.&#13;
Experience in Thailand and elsewhere suggests that "opening up" such&#13;
areas (especially by building roads), while costly, may break the poverty&#13;
cycle. However, increased population pressure in areas with poorer&#13;
soils (Southern Java, parts of the Philippines, East Malaysia) can lead to&#13;
extreme deprivation.   Even without such pressures, many Malaysians and&#13;
Indonesians who raised traditional crops of rubber and coconut on poor land&#13;
were caught without resources to modernize after the collapse of world&#13;
prices for these commodities. A smaller number of Thais and Filipinos&#13;
were similarly hurt. Any productivity increases wrested from such lands or&#13;
on more fertile soil are generally eroded by population increases. Areas&#13;
recently improved are therefore usually better-off.&#13;
The second large group of rural poor is found in "old" developed areas,&#13;
often irrigated, where population pressure has caught up with resources&#13;
(much of rural Java, for example). Here, physical and social infrastructure&#13;
is fairly complete; income, rather than access, limits its use. The higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
population density supports activities outside agriculture, and some local&#13;
multiplier effects occur. There may be work opportunities for everyone, but&#13;
labor is too plentiful, and labor incomes are low. Displacement of&#13;
traditional labor-intensive activities exacerbates this situation. If&#13;
combined with significant problem of landlessness or tenancy, widespread&#13;
poverty then occurs among people dependent largely or solely on labor&#13;
incomes.&#13;
A third poverty group is the urban one. As elsewhere, population&#13;
pressures in rural areas have spilled over into the cities of East Asia.&#13;
The usual push-pull factors are involved, together with complex labor market&#13;
mechanisms. The high cost of living in some cities may discourage in-migra-&#13;
tion.  In Jakarta, for example, transportation is costly and water has to be&#13;
purchased from a water carrier. In other cases, open land frontiers, as&#13;
in Thailand, may reduce the tendency to urbanize.&#13;
The fourth and especially vulnerable poverty group consists of people&#13;
whose participation in the productive process is limited: the disabled and&#13;
the aged. While the exended family in traditional societies usually takes&#13;
care of the old, this group may become more isolated as a result of social&#13;
changes accompanying economic development. As successful socioeconomic&#13;
development eliminates other groups of poor, poverty tends to concentrate in&#13;
groups of the old and disabled. There are signs that this has been&#13;
occurring in Korea, the most advanced country of the five. Economic&#13;
development will do little to help these hard-core poor who must look to&#13;
special government programs for support.&#13;
The Life Cycle of the Poor&#13;
Poverty households contain an above-average number of children; as a&#13;
result the incidence of poverty is higher for children than for adults A.&#13;
This relation, which has also been established in East Asia, remains valid&#13;
even if average per capita household incomes are calculated on an adult-&#13;
equivalent basis. Furthermore, the distribution of consumption items&#13;
(especially food) within the household, tends to be biased against children&#13;
(and in favor of adult males). Thus, children are almost invariably&#13;
malnourished in poverty households. Disease and parasites aggravate their&#13;
plight. Nutritional surveys in the East Asian countries confirm these&#13;
impressions.&#13;
1. During the early phase of a country's reduction in fertility, fertility&#13;
differences between the poor and nonpoor may be exacerbated. However,&#13;
contraception in most East Asian countries is now so widespread that it&#13;
probably also extends to the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
While countrywide infant and child mortality rates are down, it is likely&#13;
that they are still relatively high among the poor. On a regional basis,&#13;
poverty and mortality go hand-in-hand. Put bluntly, a Mlalthusian population&#13;
adjustment mechanism seems still to be at work among the poor. A poor infant&#13;
who survives its first year faces an arduous childhood and th- possibility&#13;
that its physical and perhaps its mental capabilities will be impaired.&#13;
In East Asia, the sex of a child, while determining most of his or&#13;
her role in life, will not be too much of a direct basis for discrimination.&#13;
Irrespective of sex, access to school may, however, be a problem for children&#13;
in poor agricultural areas. Moreover, for the first poverty group living in&#13;
these areas, where labor often is scarce, the opportunity cost of keeping&#13;
children in school can be high. These opportunity costs are probably lower&#13;
for the other poverty groups and in the usual labor-surplus conditions where&#13;
they live, may be exceeded by the private returns on education. On grounds&#13;
of access as well as demand for education (perhaps also because of quality&#13;
differences), poor children in more densely populated rural areas and cities&#13;
probably have a better chance of receiving an education than do those in&#13;
less-developed rural areas.&#13;
Poor parents must generally make substantial sacrifices in out-of-pocket&#13;
and opportunity costs to put their children through school. One study, for&#13;
Malaysia, /2 showed out-of-pocket expenses for a primary school child to be&#13;
9 percent of household income in the poorest quintile;/3 for a secondary&#13;
school child, the percentage was twice as high. Poverty households investing&#13;
in education (often for several children simultaneously) have to curtail&#13;
severely expenditures on other basic items. This is likely to affect chil-&#13;
dren most, to the possible detriment of their learning ability. Unless the&#13;
public sector helps to bear the cost of education, poor children will then&#13;
be caught in a no-win situation and will end up with little education.&#13;
Considering the well-established link between education and income in adult&#13;
life such a handicap contributes to the transmission of poverty from&#13;
generation to generation.&#13;
As the child grows up but remains at home, the household's number of&#13;
potential earners increases, and its income may improve, especially in an&#13;
environment where labor is short. In a severe labor-surplus environment.&#13;

however, where many youngsters enter the labor market, competition for work&#13;
may be fierce and the return low. The incentive for a young adult to leave&#13;
such an area will be strong, but much depends on perceived opportunities&#13;
elsewhere. Here, sex becomes an important determinant because it is more&#13;
difficult for girls to start out on their own. The situation at home also&#13;
remains important: if the parents own some land on which returns have&#13;
recently increased through irrigation or new technology, the household may&#13;
decide to absorb another member permanently spreading the work among the&#13;
family./4&#13;
The next generation repeats this pattern. The land may be subdivided&#13;
further and further, especially under Muslim inheritance laws in Malaysia&#13;
and parts of Indonesia. Even if the land the family initially had continues&#13;
to be farmed as a unit, problems of management often arise. Divorce or&#13;
death may break up households. Female-headed households usually show low&#13;
incomes, but their average size is also smaller and poverty no worse than&#13;
for the average household./5 In old age, much depends on the continued&#13;
existence of traditional support systems. When younger family members,&#13;
seeking a better life, move away from the impoverished countryside, their&#13;
little-educated, old relatives may face a bleak 'old age. This is happening&#13;
in parts of Malaysia, for instance.&#13;
Determinants of Poverty: A Framework for Analysis&#13;
In light of all these factors and the country experiences described in the&#13;
next section, what are the main determinants of poverty in East Asia?&#13;
Much of what has been has a clear Malthusian ring -- and indeed&#13;
developments in the past two decades reflect the pressure on resources&#13;
caused by the unprecedented growth in population and in the labor force.&#13;
With regard to the future, while the growth in the annual number of births&#13;
has already decelerated or even stopped (Table 1), and dependency rates are&#13;
starting to decline, the growth in the working-age population will not abate&#13;
much in the next decade. In a simple and perhaps simplistic view, this&#13;
abundance of labor will, if all other factors remain constant, depress labor&#13;
incomes to the disadvantage of the labor-dependent poor.&#13;
A second aspect of poverty in East Asia is its largely rural and&#13;
agricultural character, until economic development is considerably advanced&#13;
as in Korea. In large and complex agricultural sectors, such as those in&#13;
the major East Asian countries, technology, prices, and cropping patterns&#13;
4. Geertz has described the "agricultural involution" in Java.&#13;
5. This situation may already reflects a poverty-adjustment mechanism,&#13;
whereby someone other than the single parent takes care of children.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

undergo constant change, changes that often influence incomes and poverty&#13;
more in the short and medium term than do the longer term demographic&#13;
factors. But eventually, demographic influences assert themselves constantly&#13;
and inexorably, unless offset by other powerful influences, such as the&#13;
absorption of workers outside agriculture. Thus, demographic pressure,&#13;
farm income, and demand for labor weave a complex web of trends that have&#13;
to be untangled if basic factors and relations that entrap major segments of&#13;
the population in poverty are to be understood.&#13;
A growing population can be absorbed relatively easily if. new land as&#13;
good as the marginal land already under cultivation can be developed easily,&#13;
without large private investments or government support. As long as&#13;
technology and prices in the original marginal agricultural activity remain&#13;
static, and this activity initially occupied many people, such lateral&#13;
expansion will occur at roughly constant incomes for the marginal groups in&#13;
agriculture. As indicated by experience in Thailand, the incidence of&#13;
poverty in agriculture may still decline significantly under these&#13;
conditions, as some areas or groups (including possibly those in the newly&#13;
developed areas) benefit from government programs, improved technology or&#13;
prices, or the opening of markets for new crops. In most cases, such&#13;
beneftits; are not netitralized quickly by permanent rural migration, though&#13;
they tend to wither away gradually by differential rural-urban migration, as&#13;
poverty pushes fewer people out of these more affluent areas.&#13;
In these circumstances, a well-functioning labor market with an elastic&#13;
supply of labor from the large marginal group in agriculture will keep&#13;
unskilled wages down throughout the country and will also moderate rural-&#13;
urban migration. As long as nonagricultural labor absorption remains small&#13;
in relation to the size of the marginal agricultural group, its influence on&#13;
the labor market and on labor incomes of the marginal groups will remain&#13;
limited. On the other hand, any increase in the incomes of the large&#13;
marginal group in agriculture will rapidly influence labor incomes in other&#13;
groups and sectors, including urban ones.&#13;
The "easy" situation of an ample supply of at least moderately&#13;
productive land has existed mainly in Thailand, but even there the land&#13;
resources have been dwindling rapidly. Where such land is not available,&#13;
the determinants of poverty become much more complicated, because there is&#13;
no basic "floor" under poverty incomes. In agriculture, applying more labor&#13;
to the same land base (or bringing less-fertile land under cultivation)&#13;
drives down returns on labor and increases those on (old) land./6 These&#13;
long-term factors are intertwined with regional and product-specific changes&#13;
6. Apart from any direct effect this may have on the distribution of&#13;
income, it will increase the incentive to distinguish ownership from&#13;
cultivatorship of the land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
in production technology and prices, which always occur. Some of these&#13;
changes may directly influence the demand for labor. Others may, through&#13;
income change, modify the tendency of the growing household labor force to&#13;
stay on the farm rather than try its luck elsewhere. In other words,&#13;
income increases in specific agricultural households, even if they are not&#13;
poor, may influence the net supply of labor from these households to the&#13;
economy and, through that process, marginal labor incomes and the situation&#13;
of the poor.&#13;
Unless employment and incomes on already cultivated land increase&#13;
rapidly, the effect of dwindling land availability will be that many more&#13;
workers enter the nonagricultural'labor market. The all-important question&#13;
for the poor then becomes: What level of labor incomes can they obtain in&#13;
the market?&#13;
Information about labor markets and their functioning has generally&#13;
been scant, and its analysis difficult. With some important exceptions,&#13;
notably Malaysia, labor markets appear to have worked well in the East Asia&#13;
region.  Conceptually, job creation can be divided into primary, secondary,&#13;
and residual categories.j7 Primary jobs can be defined as those created by&#13;
overcoming supply constraints (mainly through investment)./8    Secondary jobs&#13;
are spinoffs from primary ones through interindustry and demand effects&#13;
(employment multipliers). Residual jobs are those that emerge to balance&#13;
the labor market, since the poor cannot afford to be unemployed./9. As long&#13;
as this residual is positive, it tends to drive down labor incomes. The&#13;
trouble with this conceptual categorization of jobs is that statistical&#13;
information on employment always is ex post, and therefore includes the&#13;
residual category. Unless this category can be isolated, information on&#13;
"Jobs created" is therefore not necessarily useful for analyzing labor&#13;
market trends. In fact, a rapid increase in employment may mean that the&#13;
poor have to work harder to make ends meet.&#13;
Since it is so difficult to determine employment trends ex ante, the&#13;
situation on the labor market has generally been deduced from trends in real&#13;
wages, rather than the other way around. However, information also tends to&#13;
be scant on unskilled wages in general, on those in the traditional sector&#13;
7. In this discussion, jobs include self-employment. The discussion refers&#13;
mainly to the informal sector, where most of the employment is at present.&#13;
8. This category should be net of negative effects on jobs elsewhere,&#13;
especially in the traditional sector.&#13;
9.  In East Asia, as elsewhere, unemployment appears to be concenrated among&#13;
secondary earners in nonpoverty households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
in particular, and on movements in prices paid by the poor. As a result,&#13;
real trends for the lowest wages have been difficult to establish. The work&#13;
on labor markets and wages in East Asian countries has therefore consisted&#13;
mainly of attempts to fit various pieces of circumstantial evidence into a&#13;
plausible pattern. Much remains to be done in this area.&#13;
Finally, how does the labor market link back to the dynamics of&#13;
poverty? Much of the agricultural development in already cultivated areas&#13;
has occurred through (increased) irrigation or technological changes in many&#13;
cases enhanced by improved agricultural terms of trade in the last decade.&#13;
While most of the direct benefits may have gone to the owners or cultivators&#13;
of the land, other groups have benefited from multiplier effects. These&#13;
local (and probably also total) multipliers could have been higher had rural&#13;
industrialization been more successful (as in Taiwan). In all countries,&#13;
except to some extent in Korea, manufacturing development, however,&#13;
clustered in or around large cities. Many jobs were created in export&#13;
manufacturing in Korea, appreciable numbers in Malaysia, and much smaller&#13;
ones (in relation to the size of the economy) in Thailand and the&#13;
Philippines (Table 3, last line). The multiplier effects were no doubt&#13;
substantial, as were those of natural resource-financed increases in public&#13;
expenditures in Indonesia and Malaysia. Rainfed areas, where technology&#13;
progressed slowly if at all and few multiplier effects developed often&#13;
lagged behind. Where the population in these areas or in those with high&#13;
initial population pressures constituted a significant part of the total,&#13;
the labor market had difficulty in absorbing the overflow, with adverse&#13;
consequences for the poor throughout the economy (as in the Philippines).&#13;
On the other hand, where both agricultural and industrial development&#13;
succeeded (as in Korea) the creation of primary and secondary jobs outpaced&#13;
the growth in the labor force, labor incomes rose throughout the economy,&#13;
and poverty was significantly reduced.&#13;
5. Country Experiences&#13;
Against the background of the preceding discussion, the principal determi-&#13;
nants of poverty levels and trends in each of the five countries are discussed&#13;
in this section. To concentrate on essentials, much enlightening detail must&#13;
be eliminated. Readers in search of more complete material should consult the&#13;
main sources mentioned in the bibliography. In addition, most of the data&#13;
on poverty and its incidence are now some four years old, and since then&#13;
trends may have changed. The purpose of this paper is, however, not so much&#13;
to assess comparative performances in the alleviation of poverty but rather&#13;
to reflect on the policies and processes that may have ameliorated&#13;
or aggravated poverty. This should help in formulating more integrated,&#13;
concrete strategies to deal with poverty in different countries according to&#13;
their own country-specific constraints.&#13;

Thailand: Poverty Reduction under Favorable Land Availability&#13;
Thailand is one of the few food-exporting developing countries.    It&#13;
remains primarily a country of farmers. In 1977 three-quarters of Thai&#13;
workers were still engaged in agriculture. But this sector produced&#13;
only 28 percent of total value added that year. One important damper on&#13;
agricultural incomes has been the export tax on rice which has, however,&#13;
also kept domestic food prices low and in that sense has helped the poor.&#13;
Until recently, to protect domestic industry, fertilizer prices have been&#13;
high; this has adversely influenced the level of inputs and technical&#13;
sophistication of agriculture. These adverse factors have been largely&#13;
offset by the ready availability of land. Since 1960 the area under&#13;
holdings has grown 4 percent a year and average farm size has expanded. But&#13;
this favorable situation is now rapidly ending.&#13;
Stimulated by active private trading in agricultural products and by a&#13;
large public road-building program, Thai agriculture has not only expanded&#13;
geographically but has also diversified tremendously in the last two&#13;
decades. Rubber, kenaf, maize, cassava, and sugar have become major crops,&#13;
in addition to the traditional rice. Except for rubber and cassava, the&#13;
agricultural terms of trade improved, partly as a result of a reduction in&#13;
the export tax on rice. Between 1962 and 1976, the average agricultural&#13;
household's real income is estimated to have increased by 60 percent; a&#13;
third of this gain resulted from improved terms of trade.&#13;
Among the 12 subregional "typical" agricultural households distinguished&#13;
in the Bank's 1978 Basic Report, levels of income and changes therein have&#13;
varied widely. The main causes of this variation were the levels of initial&#13;
incomes, opportunities for cultivating new land and new crops, the extent of&#13;
water control, and prices. Four of these typical households, in regions&#13;
accounting for 43 percent of all households, had household incomes of less&#13;
than US$500 a year in 1976, an average per capita income of less than $100.&#13;
The other typical household groups all had average incomes above $600, and&#13;
those located on the east and west of the Central Plains, which grow mainly&#13;
upland crops commercially and account for 9 percent of all agricultural&#13;
households, even had incomes above $1,000. Despite this regional diversity,&#13;
one pattern is clear: the closer a province is to Bangkok, the higher is its&#13;
per capita income.&#13;
While there is in each (sub)region a considerable variation in&#13;
characteristics around the "typical" farm, the favorable land availability&#13;
has prevented the emergence of a class of very small farmers. Typically,&#13;
also, those cultivating less land have higher off-farm incomes. Neither is&#13;
tenancy a pervasive problem. Thus, poverty is largely concentrated in areas&#13;
of low agricultural income and, within those areas, in households having&#13;
low skills and high dependency ratios. Of the 43 percent of farm households&#13;
mentioned above which "typically" had per capita incomes below $100 in 1976&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(compared to an informal poverty line of $82), two-thirds live in the upper&#13;
and lower Northeast. Most of them grow rice under unfavorable soil and&#13;
climatic conditions, have poor access to services and markets, and uncertain&#13;
titles to their land. The other large group of farmers with low-income&#13;
increases over the last 15 years and currently low-income levels lives in&#13;
the upper North, outside the irrigated areas, where the land-man ratio is&#13;
unfavorable. Few technological packages have yet been developed or&#13;
introduced to those farmers, and unlike farmers in other areas they still&#13;
grow largely the same crops under the same conditions as their fathers did.&#13;
Because price indices by income group and rural region are not&#13;
available, trends in rural poverty are difficult to assess. From all&#13;
available information -- including national and regional accounts,&#13;
expenditure surveys, and work on the regional typology of farmers -- the&#13;
incidence of rural poverty appears to have been reduced significantly,&#13;
probably by as much as 40 percent. The exceptions were some of the poorest&#13;
groups of farmers in the North and Northeast.&#13;
The labor market picture has been dominated by the absorption of&#13;
labor on newly cultivated land. In the 1960s and 1970s, agriculture absorbed&#13;
60-65 percent of the additional workers without a drop in marginal real&#13;
agricultural incomes.L1 With the other sectors only providing modest, though&#13;
gradually increasing, opportunities for employment, and given relatively&#13;
well functioning labor markets, the marginal returns to labor in agriculture&#13;
seem to be the main determinants of wage levels throughout the economy,&#13;
after allowing for the costs of migration. The crucial and largest agricul-&#13;
tural area is the Northeast. There, real wage rates have stagnated since&#13;
1960, causing stagnation of unskilled laborers' real wages and self-employed&#13;
workers' real incomes in the nonagricultural sectors of the rest of the&#13;
economy (including Bangkok).&#13;
In other rural areas, especially in the double-cropped parts of the&#13;
Central Plains and the North, real wages increased in the 1970s after a&#13;
decade of stagnation. This gain can be explained by the tigntness of local&#13;
labor markets during seasonal peaks and by the relatively high costs of&#13;
short-term movements of labor over long distances.&#13;
In 1976-77 agricultural wages in the Northeast were in the range of&#13;
US$0.60 to $1.00 a day, depending on the season and type of work.L2 In&#13;
1. In fact, incomes in some of the newly developed areas were higher than&#13;
elsewhere. There were no indications that agriculture was absorbing residual&#13;
labor (as defined in the previous section).&#13;
2. By comparison, a poor farmer's annual income, divided by 250 working days&#13;
in the year, was less than $0.50.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
the Northern and Central regions they were 25 percent and 50 percent higher,&#13;
respectively. Nonagricultural wages were $1.30 to $1.50 a day. Considering&#13;
that these wages were paid mainly in urban areas where the poverty line is&#13;
much higher, they were only moderately higher in real terms than agricultural&#13;
wages in the Northeast./3 At the lowest of these rates, an urban worker&#13;
would have to be employed 250 days a year to support one other person at the&#13;
formal poverty line (Table 5). At the lower informal poverty line, two&#13;
persons could be supported. In a normal household of five to six persons&#13;
fully dependent on incomes from unskilled labor, at least two members and,&#13;
under less favorable conditions or assumptions, three members must work to&#13;
keep the household out of poverty. At higher skill levels, the need for&#13;
employment diminishes: in Bangkok in 1975, for example, a mechanic earned&#13;
1.75 times the wage of an unskilled worker in manufacturing.&#13;
Because of the high participation rates of the less affluent in urban&#13;
areas, and the absence of labor market pressure from rural areas, the&#13;
inciden'ce of urban poverty has been low. Stagnating real wages have,&#13;
however, left the incidence of poverty almost unchanged since the late 1960s.&#13;
Whatever improvement has occurred has come from an upgrading of the labor&#13;
force.&#13;
Public policy in Thailand has generally not favored the poor. According&#13;
to Bank estimates, until 1972 the direct incidence of Thailand's overall tax&#13;
system was roughly proportional to incomes. So was its expenditure. Govern-&#13;
ment expenditures per capita per province have been positively correlated&#13;
with provincial per capita incomes, which are in turn correlated with&#13;
proximity to Bangkok. This pattern of expenditures is reflected in the&#13;
geographical distribution of public services.    Education, for instance, has&#13;
lagged in the North and Northeast. This has important long-term implications&#13;
for these poor regions, since it has been shown that education beyond four&#13;
years is clearly related to output by Thailand's rice farmers, and infant&#13;
mortality in rural areas is correlated with the education of the mother.&#13;
Health care facilities are also unevenly distributed. The government has&#13;
started a program to improve rural facilities below the provincial level,&#13;
which suffer from underutilization.&#13;
Family planning has progressed rapidly. By 1975 45 percent of fertile&#13;
couples were using contraceptives in the North and Central Regions, 30 percent&#13;
in the Northeast, 18 percent in the (Muslim) South, and 50 percent in&#13;
Bangkok. Provincial differences in fertility'reduction and use of contra-&#13;
ceptives appear in some instances to be related to land scarcity, with&#13;

may also reflect some skill differential between marginal urban and rural&#13;
jobs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
fertility lowest in the land-hungry upper North. The reduction in fertility&#13;
has started to influence the outlook for population growth substantially.&#13;
In view of Thailand's dwindling land resources, this significantly increases&#13;
the opportunities for a continued reduction in the incidence of poverty in&#13;
the future.&#13;
The Philippines: EmerRinR Evidence of Increasing Poverty&#13;
While the Philippines and Thailand are at a comparable stage of&#13;
economic development, the land frontier has been closed over much of the&#13;
Philippines for some time. Partly as a result of this, the Philippine&#13;
economy has been growing somewhat more slowly (Table 3). In view also of&#13;
the rather capital-intensive character of the Philippines' industrial&#13;
development, it has been difficult to absorb the large additions to the&#13;
labor force. As a result, over the decade 1965-75, real labor incomes have&#13;
been dropping, and the incidence of poverty has been increasing.&#13;
There are several signs that labor demand and supply have been balanced&#13;
only with the help of residual job creation (as defined in Section 4).&#13;
Migration appears to be substantially related to the availability of land.&#13;
In important parts of the service sector, labor absorption has grown faster&#13;
than production, and overall productivity has fallen. The decline in labor&#13;
participation rates among the young seems greater than can be explained by-&#13;
the increase in educational enrollment. Most importantly, it appears that,&#13;
starting in the 1960s, real wages declined in both urban and rural areas, in&#13;
every region and in nearly every occupation./4&#13;
Occupational mobility in the labor force appears substantial,&#13;
especially in rural areas. As a result, agricutural wages seem to differ&#13;
little from the marginal return to labor working on the family farm. Because&#13;
of the scarcity of land, there are, however, problems of landlessness and&#13;
tenancy. Also, many farmer-owners hold only limited amounts of land, and&#13;
the incidence of poverty among them is not much lower than among tenants or&#13;
farm latorers. While agricultural growth has not been much slower than in&#13;
Thailand, its benefits have largely accrued to a limited number of existing&#13;
land owners.&#13;
4. This finding, as well as the one indicating an increasing incidence of&#13;
poverty, of course depend on the price deflator chosen. While there is as&#13;
yet no indication that this deflator is too high, price data are few and may&#13;
not be fully dependable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
In 1975 agricultural wage rates in most regions were around US$0.80&#13;
a day, only about twice the level of the informal poverty line, assuming 250&#13;
working days per year./5 Under those circumstances, the incidence of rural&#13;
poverty had' to be high. In Manila and suburbs,, the average daily unskilled&#13;
wage rate in industry was about $1.90 in 1977. Because of the much higher.&#13;
cost of living there (about 35 percent above the average for urban areas,&#13;
indicated in the poverty lines of Table 5), /6 this net wage was in real&#13;
terms only moderately higher than in rural areas. Some special area studies&#13;
show significantly lower incomes in the urban traditional sector. Thus, the&#13;
incidence of poverty cannot be much lower in urban areas than in rural&#13;
areas. Indeed, the data in Table 5 show that urban poverty, which used to&#13;
be lower, has nearly caught up with rural poverty.&#13;
The information on trends in real labor incomes and in the incidence of&#13;
poverty, while not easy to interpret, seems to be consistent. The real wage&#13;
rates of agricultural workers and of unskilled workers in Manila have&#13;
followed a downward trend since 1960, with fairly significant fluctuations&#13;
in between (especially a recovery in the late 19609). Skilled labor wages&#13;
in Manila dropped much more than those of the unskilled, indicating an&#13;
especially unfavorable labor market for skilled workers as well as reduced&#13;
returns on education. The marked decline in real wages in 1972-74, and a&#13;
subsequent recovery in real wages in agriculture (but not in urban areas)&#13;
are, however, not easily explained with reference to long-term developments&#13;
on the labor market./7 These fluctuations may have been related to rapidly&#13;
accelerating inflation and lagging nominal wages. Such an explanation&#13;
appears more relevant to wages in the fonmal sector than to the overall&#13;
level of labor incomes, where the informal sector has a large weight (the&#13;
statistics may largely reflect formal wages).&#13;
With regard to trends in the incidence of poverty, major technical&#13;
problems arise in comparing the various surveys, especially those before&#13;
1965. For whatever they Are worth, the comparisons show a significant&#13;
reduction in the incidence of poverty between 1957 and 1965 (perhaps mainly&#13;
5. For this comparison, wages were inflated to the 1977 level by the&#13;
consumer price index.&#13;
6. This large cost difference within the urban grouping shows how crude&#13;
poverty estimates are that do not reflect such differences.&#13;
7. In his contribution to the Philippine Poverty Report, D. Lal has&#13;
suggested that these short-term fluctuations can be explained by relative&#13;
movements in the prices of various end products (produced with differing&#13;
labor intensity) which in turn have largely been caused by changes in&#13;
government policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
along the lines experienced in Thailand), a roughly constant incidence&#13;
between 1965 and 1971, and a large deterioration between 1971 and 1975. The&#13;
extent of poverty in 1975 is probably exaggerated by a significant undercount&#13;
of expenditures in that year, and incidental factors may also have con-&#13;
tributed to the increase in poverty. All other evidence, including that on&#13;
wages, confirms that a deterioration did indeed occur, especially in urban&#13;
areas.&#13;
Other data also indicate that poverty is a serious problem in the&#13;
Philippines. Nutrition surveys show that malnutrition among children was&#13;
worse in 1976 than in 1958-67, on average. While life expectancy is high,/8&#13;
so is infant mortality,/9 and the combination of the two is consistent with&#13;
the existence of poverty.&#13;
Most health care facilities are run by the private sector, and their&#13;
high cost limits access to the poor. There are large disparities in the&#13;
levels of services between urban and rural areas. Government expenditures&#13;
in the health sector, with relatively heavy emphasis on curative services,&#13;
amount to less than 0.6 percent of GNP.&#13;
In education, the Philippines compare well with other developing&#13;
countries, and even with some developed ones. Primary education, which is&#13;
free, shows full enrollment, but dropout rates are high, especially in poor&#13;
rural areas. The private sector plays a large role in secondary and higher&#13;
education; fees are charged and subsidies to the rich for these types of&#13;
education are lower than in many other countries. Because of the Philippines'&#13;
high level of secondary and tertiary education and the slow growth of modern&#13;
sector employment, social and private returns on education have probably&#13;
declined to low levels.&#13;
Korea: Rapid Labor Absorption at Increasing Incomes&#13;
Korea's "success story" has been documented in many studies, both inside and&#13;
outside the Bank. Part of the reason lies in Korea's wealth of statistics.&#13;
But, these data are often incomplete or contradictory. It has recently been&#13;
shown, for instance, that when gaps in coverage are taken into account, the&#13;
Korean income distribution, though good by international comparison, is&#13;
significantly less equal than had generally been believed./10 The information&#13;
8. It does not appear to have improved much since the late 1960s.&#13;
9. In 1975 children under the age of 10 accounted for 40 percent of all&#13;
deaths, and about half of these were of infants under one year of age.&#13;

a Reassessment" 1979.&#13;

on prices is also weak. Various price indices show quite different rates of&#13;
inflation, and this makes the assessment of trends in real income difficult.&#13;
One fact is certain: in Korea, itnlike the other countries, the growth rate&#13;
of the working age population has recently peaked and is gradually slowing.&#13;
Korea ran out of arable land a long time ago. The little land there is&#13;
was redistributed soon after World War II, and since then rules on maximum&#13;
ownership have been strictly enforced. Unlike the Philippines, economic&#13;
growth and labor absorption have been high outside agriculture. Korea's&#13;
manufacturing sector (especially its exports:) contributed heavily to Korean&#13;
development. In 1964-68, the takeoff period, nearly half of new employment&#13;
was created in industry; in 1972-77, more than half. The intervening years&#13;
1968-72, when many workers were absorbed into agriculture, were a time not&#13;
only of less buoyant industrial growth but also of strong improvements in&#13;
the agricultural terms of trade.&#13;
There is strong evidence that, contrary to developments in the&#13;
Philippines, the labor market has been tightening in Korea. Productivity&#13;
has risen rapidly not only in industry but also in the services sector,&#13;
which in a situation of land scarcity may easily become a reservoir of&#13;
residual employment. The participation rate has been rising, especially&#13;
among secondary earners. While direct statistical information on real labor&#13;
incomes is problematic, there can be no doubt that real labor incomes have&#13;
increased substantially,. if only because they could not possibly have been&#13;
at their current level two decades ago, given Korea's low level of national&#13;
income at that time.&#13;
Compared with the other four countries, Korean labor incomes are&#13;
considerably higher, even if they are discounted by differences in poverty&#13;
lines. In Korea's closely knit economy, with its well-functioning labor&#13;
markets, the differences between nominal urban and rural wages are small;&#13;
differences in wages appear to be related mainly to sex. The average&#13;
unskilled daily wage rate in agriculture and manufacturing (for long hours)&#13;
in 1977 was more than US$4 for males and more than $3 for females. Farm&#13;
income per worker was about the same; income per worker in the service&#13;
sector somewhat lower. Of course, many workers earned less than the average.&#13;
An estimated 6 percent of male and 20 percent of female workers earned less&#13;
than $2.40 a day in 1977. Even that amount is, however, three times the&#13;
formal and 4.5 times the informal poverty line income in rural areas. For&#13;
the urban areas, these ratios and therefore the ability to support&#13;
dependents were somewhat lower, 2.5 and nearly 4, respectively. This, and&#13;
the lower female participation rate, explains the higher poverty incidence&#13;
in urban areas. These favorable ratios between labor incomes and the cost&#13;
of living at the poverty line, together with high and increasing&#13;
participation rates (notwithstanding increased educational enrollment),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
rapidly dropping dependency ratios,/11 and a relatively even distribution of&#13;
income in rural areas make for a low incidence of poverty in Korea.      Poverty&#13;
is probably confined mainly to the handicapped and households with a high&#13;
dependency ratio.&#13;
The available figures on trends in the incidence of poverty suffer from&#13;
uncertainty about the deflator which should be used. In addition, data on&#13;
income distribution are available only on a household basis rather than on a&#13;
per capita household one. Some estimates that indicate the incidence of&#13;
poverty to have been reduced by up to two-thirds from 1965 to 1977 appear&#13;
plausible. The picture with regard to real labor income points in the&#13;
direction of large gains in the early period of rapid growth in industrial&#13;
employment (1964-68), continued increases in the period of renewed absorption&#13;
of labor into agriculture under the influence of improved terms of trade&#13;
(1968-72), but slower growth thereafter until 1977-78 boom. The slackening&#13;
of labor income growth in 1972-77 may have hbt-n par    -.y .lated to the&#13;
extremely rapid expansion of the labor force in those years (4 percent a&#13;
year).&#13;
Apart from its overall economic and growth policy, which had a profound&#13;
positive influence on the alleviation of poverty, the government also&#13;
directly influenced incomes and their distribution. While the tax system&#13;
appears to be regressive in urban areaAs and only mildly progressive in rural&#13;
areas, public expendititr'-.'4    t ag !.istributive effect in that the poor&#13;
benefit more than the rich in relation to their incomes (though not in&#13;
absolute amounts). The earlier land reform and the later support system for&#13;
foodgrain prices have also been of great significance. While the food price&#13;
supports have raised Korea's domestic food prices well above international&#13;
levels, their direct effect on the real incomes of poor consumers has been&#13;
-itigated by subsidies, especially on "poor-men's foods" such as barley.&#13;
The food price policies have no doubt increased incomes in the (generally&#13;
poorer) rural areas. Their indirect effect has been to keep more people on&#13;
the farm and therefore reduce the pressure on the labor market, thereby also&#13;
benefiting the poor.&#13;
Compared with many developing countries, Korea's social development&#13;
expenditures have been 'nol- Ei relation to GNP.      Nevertheless, the rapid&#13;
increases in privatet          teid in absolute expenditures for social&#13;
development that accompanied fast economic growth have enabled improvements&#13;
in health, high levels of educational attainment, and good access to basic&#13;
services. The rural development program has been particularly successful in&#13;
improving the quality of rural life.&#13;
11.  Because of the steep dro) hi. fertility, the population of working age&#13;
increased from 54% of the total in 1960 to 60% in 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Despite this progress, a number of problems persist. Health services&#13;
are less accessible in rural than in urban areas, the cost of hospitalization&#13;
is beyond the reach of many Koreans, and there are emerging problems of&#13;
crowding and pollution. Primary education, though compulsory, is not yet&#13;
eill charges.   In middle and high schools, fees and other costs put a&#13;
heavy burden on poor families.&#13;
One of Korea's most successful efforts' has been in population control.&#13;
The proportion of married women of reproductive age practicing contraception&#13;
increased from 9 percent to 44 percent from 1964 to 1976. A similar increase&#13;
occurred in the proportion of women who had "ever had" an abortion. As a&#13;
result, the total fertil.Liy rai: ,Ll which was over six in the late 1950s,&#13;
was approximately halved 20 years later. In recent years, the government&#13;
has greatly stepped up its investments in the social sectors. If Korea&#13;
fulfills current expectations and reaches developed-country income levels in&#13;
little more than a decade, social services must be greatly improved if&#13;
social development is not to lag substantially behind economic development.&#13;
1Malaysia: Persistent Poverty in a Fraamented Economy&#13;
For so small a country, Malaysia distinguishes itself by its internal&#13;
diversity. Not only are Peninsular /13 and East Malaysia much different,&#13;
b'ut the East and West sides of Peninsular Malaysia are also differert.&#13;
There is great ethnic diversity. The numerically dominant Malays are largely&#13;
identified with smallholder agriculture; the Chinese with the "modern"&#13;
sector in the cities, and the Indians with the estates and some professions.&#13;
Within the government, the states are vested with strong prerogatives,&#13;
especially in their access to land.&#13;
The economy reflects all these divisions in a high degree of income in-&#13;
equality and in segmented labor markets. As a result of this fragmentation&#13;
and the large real price decline in the 1960s of rubber, its major&#13;
export product, Malaysia suffers from a high degree of poverty relative to&#13;
its available resources and its level of per capita income.&#13;
Aside from its fragmented economic, social, and institutional structtire,&#13;
other factors have militated against the use of Malaysia's conisieleable&#13;
resources (described in Section 2) for the alleviation of poverty. Much of&#13;
Malaysia's exports, amounting to some 50 percent of GNP, are in primary&#13;
commodities, which are subject to wide price fluctuations. There has there-&#13;
fore been a tendency to project revenues from these resources cautiously.&#13;
12. Average number of children born to women finishing their fertile period.&#13;
13.  Much of this discussion refers to Peninsular Malaysia, with 85 percent&#13;
of the country's population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
In addition, much of the increased revenues, especially from oil, have&#13;
accrued to the public sector. A policy of using these revenues to stimulate&#13;
the private sector, which is largely in the hands of foreigners and non-Malay&#13;
residents, could conflict with the government's objective of restructuring&#13;
corporate ownership under its New Economic Policy. Finally, perhaps because&#13;
compromises must be carefully constructed between various interest groups,&#13;
planning is adjusted only slowly to changing circumstances, while implementa-&#13;
tion responds slowly to new planning directives.&#13;
During the 1960s, demographic factors and unfavorable economic&#13;
conditions limited the growth of the labor force and probably induced some&#13;
out-migration. As these effects wore off in the 1970s, labor force growth&#13;
accelerated to mwre than 3 percent a year.    It will be some time before the&#13;
reduction of fertility, which began in the 1960s, significantly slows the&#13;
growth of labor force. As a result, the economy will have to absorb about&#13;
140,000 workers a year from 1975 to 1990, nearly three times more in&#13;
absolute terms than the number absorbed annually in the 1960s.&#13;
Around 1975, agriculture provided work for nearly half the labor&#13;
force./14 As a result of severe constraints on annual cropping, most of the&#13;
cultivated land is under tree crops, except for the relatively small river&#13;
valleys which are under paddy. Even after 15 years of diversification, in&#13;
1975 about 55 percent of the cultivated area in Peninsular Malaysia was&#13;
still under rubber./15 The steep structural fall in rubber prices in the&#13;
1960s thus dealt the economy a major blow. While the estates and larger&#13;
farmers could afford to replant with much more productive varieties, many&#13;
smallholders could not and suffered severe income losses. In addition, the&#13;
profit squeezed estates reduced their labor force. This cutback resulted in&#13;
open unemployment, out-migration, and absorption of many workers into the&#13;
tertiary sector, probably in residual employment. Systematic data on real&#13;
labor incomes are not available, but the real wages of lower-paid workers in&#13;
the organized sector seem to have stagnated or have declined in most of the&#13;
1960s.&#13;
On the positive side, the 1960s and 1970s were a time of significant&#13;
diversification for Malaysia, out of rubber and into palm oil, forestry, and&#13;
manufacturing, and, most recently, petroleum. These shifts prepared the&#13;
country well to benefit from the world commodity boom of the early 1970s.&#13;
14. Because of the high export ratio and the consequently high degree of&#13;
commercialization of the economy, the service sector is relatively large.&#13;
15. In substantial parts of East Malaysia hill paddy is grown under&#13;
conditions of extremely low productivity and severe poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
In addition, the New Economic Policy's ambitious development goals contri-&#13;
buted to greatly accelerated growth in production and incomes. Many new&#13;
jobs were created in labor-intensive light manufacturing, largely export-&#13;
oriented. Increased activity in the public sector also created jobs, through&#13;
land development, for instance. Apart from some cyclical fluctuations, the&#13;
effects of these developments on real wages have, however, not yet been very&#13;
pronounced.&#13;
The main reason for this disappointing result apears to be that the&#13;
benefits of development have largely focused on a number of special groups.&#13;
The modern manufacturing sector, geographically concentrated in and around&#13;
large towns and sectorally concentrated in textiles, clothing, and electro-&#13;
nics, mainly hired young girls, and the effect has not percolated throughout&#13;
the countryside, where many of the disadvantaged appear to be undereducated&#13;
older farmers, mostly Malay. The government's development program has&#13;
brought substantial benefits to agriculture, but only for a limited number&#13;
of households.&#13;
In so segmented a labor market, the incomes of each group of workers&#13;
must be examined separately. Rubber smallholders as a group, on an average&#13;
household basis, may have experienced a fall of up to 20 percent in real&#13;
income in the 1960s, and a return to slightly more than the 1960 level in&#13;
the 1970s. But this average contains households with plots of up to 40&#13;
hectares as well as new settlers on government-developed land with plots of&#13;
4 to 5 hectares, who must have done better than the average. On the other&#13;
hand, small farmers who could not afford to replant must have fared worse.&#13;
Although paddy farmers on average improved their incomes by some 20 percent&#13;
in the 1960s and another 20 percent in the 1970s, these gains must also have&#13;
been heavily concentrated among the beneficiaries of new irrigation projects.&#13;
It is probable that the smaller group of farmers dependent on coconut&#13;
cultivation also saw its income decline.&#13;
In general, the problems of agricultural poverty are related to small&#13;
farm size and low returns per hectare, often in combination because a small&#13;
farmer cannot finance the investments or inputs to improve yields. In&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia in 1977, smallholder agriculture consisted of nearly&#13;
800,000 households cultivating an average area of 2.8 hectares, or 0.5&#13;
hectares per person. To stay ahead of poverty without outside means, a&#13;
household with such a holding must secure returns per hectare of twice the&#13;
poverty lines in Table 5, US$400 and $265, respectively, for the formal and&#13;
informal poverty lines. Most crops provide such returns (an important&#13;
exception being "old" rubber at $100 a hectare), but many farmers have&#13;
smaller holdings or obtain less than average yields. Problems of tenancy&#13;
close the noose, consigning many smallholder households to live in poverty.&#13;
In comparison, workers in the organized sector are well off (for&#13;
the unorganized nonagricultural sector, no data on labor incomes are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
available). In 1977 daily %rnskilled wages for males were about US$3.00 in&#13;
urban and $2.40 in rural areas. For females, the rates were $2.40 and $2.00,&#13;
respectively. At these rates, substantial numbers of dependents can be&#13;
supported. Considering also that employment for secondary earners is more&#13;
readily available in large urban centers, this explaJns the relatively low&#13;
incidence of poverty in urban areas, where probably only a relatively small&#13;
number of workers in the informal sector are in poverty. Rural workers in&#13;
the formal sector, especially on the estates, may, however, find it ditficult&#13;
to secure secondary incomes for a sufficient number of family memabers.&#13;
With regard to public policy on the provision of basic services, the&#13;
poor are well represented in the use of public medical care and primary&#13;
education, but many cannot afford to pay for utilities, even if they have&#13;
access to them. Recent achievements in education have been impressive, with&#13;
regard both to enrollment and to the correction of racial imbalances. Adult&#13;
illiteracy among the old remains a problem, however, and probably contributes&#13;
significantly to rural poverty. In health, standards of preventive care are&#13;
high. Fertility started to drop in the early 1960s, and by 1977 the&#13;
estimated total fertility rate had declined to 3.8 children.&#13;
Although the government has demonstrated its commitment to the allevia-&#13;
tion of poverty, weaknesses persist in policy coordination. The inability&#13;
to apply abundant resources to the alleviation of poverty has been mentioned.&#13;
Heavy export taxes are levied on rubber, even though rubber smallholders are&#13;
one of the most important poverty groups. Information on poverty households&#13;
in rubber is available only at the State level, not at federal level. Rubber&#13;
replanting grants have been adjusted only sluggishly for inflation, and have&#13;
never covered income supplements while new trees reached maturity. Regulatory&#13;
interventions in private enterprise to achieve ethnic restructuring have&#13;
probably not taken sufficient account of their negative indirect effect on&#13;
such restructuring through dampening overall activity. Accumulating petro-&#13;
leum revenues may be devoted to capital-intensive investments in the petro-&#13;
leum and petrochemical sectors, while poverty alleviation proceeds only&#13;
slowly. On the other hand, some major policies, such as the stimulation of&#13;
manufactured exports and the long-standing commitment to publicly organized&#13;
land development have undoubtedly helped to alleviate poverty.&#13;
Indonesia: Complexities of a Rapidly Growing Poor Economy&#13;
Indonesia's case is too complex to be explored satisfactorily in this short&#13;
paper. Large and internally diverse, this country underwent a major socio-&#13;
political upheaval in the 1960s so that meaningful comparisons can only&#13;
be made for the extremely short period 1970-76. Furthermore, whatever data&#13;
are available on poverty are subject to wide differences of interpretation.&#13;
The complexity of the labor market structure contributes to the analytical&#13;
difficulties, especially in Java where the number of impoverished indivi-&#13;
duals probably exceeds the combined totals of the other four countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
The extreme scarcity of land has forced many persons, especially the poor&#13;
and landless, to eke out a living in a multitude of mainly informal&#13;
activities, further complicating the labor market.&#13;
There nevertheless are many points of agreement. Indonesia is at&#13;
the lowest welfare level of the five countries, according not only to per&#13;
capita income level but also to such basic indicators as life expectancy&#13;
(below 50 years in 1977). The incidence of poverty is high.&#13;
Compared with the other countries, population growth has been low for&#13;
some time, especially in Java. Recent growth of the working-age population&#13;
has been above 2.5 percent. Overall labor absorption over the period&#13;
1971-76 has been high, between 3 percent and 5 percent in 1971-76 (depending&#13;
on the interpretation of statistical data). Labor absorption into modern&#13;
manufacturing has been disappointingly low, and much labor has gone into the&#13;
residual-service and cottage-industry sectors. Badly rundown infrastructure&#13;
has been repaired and expanded, using labor-intensive methods wherever&#13;
possible.&#13;
Judging from the consumption and expenditure surveys of 1970 and 1976,&#13;
there has been widespread agreement that large segments of the Indonesian&#13;
population, including middle-income owners of land or other assets, have&#13;
probably benefited from the country's rapid recovery from the grave economic&#13;
conditions of the mid- and late 1960s. Since these middle groups were&#13;
initially below the poverty line, there is little question that the&#13;
incidence of poverty has declined.&#13;
Based on this evidence, its own findings of firmness in wage trends,&#13;
and increased expenditures by the poor, the Bank concluded in its 1979&#13;
Employment and Basic Reports that the welfare of the poorest improved in the&#13;
1970s. This view has been challenged by myself and others both inside and&#13;
outside the Bank on the grounds that the wage information is scant and incon-&#13;
clusive, that the caloric consumption of the poor has not increased,/16 and&#13;
that in the stratified Javanese society the poor may not have access to the&#13;
better-paid Jobs covered by the statistics. Either interpretation could fit&#13;
into the general framework of Section 4. In the optimistic view, largely&#13;
government-initiated (and oil-financed) primary impulses, together with&#13;
substantial multipliers (proceeds from nonoil taxes showed a relative&#13;
16. It appears that the very poor used most, if not all, of the "real"&#13;
consumption increase to shift from maize to rice, and within rice to the&#13;
better qualities (changes not measured by a fixed-weight index). Even if&#13;
interpreted as revealed preference by very poor consumers (an assumption&#13;
which may be challenged) this casts a special light on the character of the&#13;
consumption increase that the very poor were able to obtain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
decline) could have been large enough to absorb substantial additional labor&#13;
at constant labor incomes. Thus, the poor were able to increase their labor&#13;
input in exchange for higher consumption. In the pessimistic interpretation,&#13;
development was accompanied by a decline in the availability of poor man's&#13;
foods (and perhaps some traditional jobs were eliminated) forcing the poorest&#13;
to work harder to keep their real consumption constant.&#13;
Data collected in connection with the government's public works program&#13;
in 1977 indicate daily wages of US$0.70 to $1.00 in rural and urban Java&#13;
alike. Assuming 250 days of work a year, these wages allow only about one&#13;
dependent a worker in the poorer rural and in the urban areas, even if the&#13;
informal poverty line is used. These wage data are thus roughly consistent&#13;
with data on the incidence of poverty. In the other islands, wages are&#13;
considerably higher ($1.00 to $1.50 a day). These areas tend to conform&#13;
more to the first type of poverty (Section 4) where land productivity is&#13;
low, and labor may not be in surplus.&#13;
The government exercises significant control over the industrial sector,&#13;
but apart from the large subsidy on oil products Cif yalued at international&#13;
prices) it seldom intervenes directly in the market. The government&#13;
has used its oil revenues and increased external borrowing to finance public&#13;
expenditures (including many capitalintensive projects), badly needed&#13;
increases in civil servants' pay, and successful public works programs. The&#13;
decision to use part of the oil revenues to finance domestic expenditures&#13;
has put pressure on the domestic prices weakening Indonesia's international&#13;
competitive position and limiting the availability of domestic credit to the&#13;
private sector.   Both factors have worked against the government's intended&#13;
development of private labor-intensive enterprise. Recently, the exchange&#13;
rate has been adjusted.&#13;
With regard to the provision of basic services, Indonesia's comparative&#13;
performance can be seen in Table 4. In health care, the government's&#13;
approach has been appropriate, but rural facilities remain underutilized.&#13;
Child mortality rates remain high, and the supply of safe water is tight. On&#13;
the positive side, Java's innovative family planning program has been very&#13;
successful, but it has been introduced only recently in most of the other&#13;
islands. Many new primary schools have been built under the public works&#13;
program, major progress has been made in the provision of books, and primary&#13;
education now reaches more than 80 percent of school-age children. Progress&#13;
in secondary and higher education has, on the other hand, been too slow to&#13;
make a significant impact on the current shortage of middle- and higher-level&#13;
manpower, which will probably grow more severe. In terms of geographical&#13;
distribution, government expenditures appear to have been allocated&#13;
equitably. In general, the less-populated provinces have received higher&#13;
allocations per capita, but these have been roughly offset by higher prices&#13;
in the "Other Islands."&#13;

6. Conclusions and Implications for Policy&#13;
As mentiond in the introduction, this paper has focused less on direct&#13;
measures to alleviate poverty, than on the socioeconomic mechanisms that&#13;
cause poverty to occur and persist in East Asia and probably elsewhere. If&#13;
effective policies to alleviate poverty are to be developed, these mechanisms&#13;
have to be understood. I have organized my conclusions, many of which still&#13;
are tentative, under the headings: macro and labor market aspects; sectoral&#13;
and regional aspects; basic needs and human resource aspects; thoughts on the&#13;
Bank's work and country relations; and the need to devise integrated strate-&#13;
gies for poverty alleviation.&#13;
Macro and Labor Market Aspects&#13;
No matter how weak the statistics, in East Asia there appears to have&#13;
been a clear relation, over countries and periods, between the growth of&#13;
national income (and private consumption) and success in the alleviation&#13;
of poverty. It has been argued in the Bank's reports on Korea and Malaysia&#13;
and in its 1975 Basic Report on Indonesia that very rapid growth -- of some&#13;
9 percent a year -- would be necessary for the benefits of economic develop-&#13;
ment to reach the poor. As in this paper, the argument was made mainly in&#13;
terms of the need to absorb sufficient labor./l    It is probably no coinci-&#13;
dence that, except for Indonesia, the countries for which the argument was&#13;
made most strongly were close to or already realizing the proposed growth&#13;
rates.&#13;
Elsewhere, the proposed strategies to deal with poverty have of&#13;
necessity been less clear-cUt. To the extent that they address the problems&#13;
of poor farmers, the proposals have a sectoral slant (see below); where the&#13;
problem is mainly population pressure and lack of assets, they tend to center&#13;
around measures to increase labor productivity.    I find these proposals often&#13;
less than convincing since much of the potential surplus labor is engaged in&#13;
traditional service and handicraft activities where demand rather than supply&#13;
is the limiting factor. Under those circumstances one worker's gain in&#13;
productivity and sales means reduced opportunity for another.&#13;
1. The main elements in the argument are as follows. Given already high&#13;
labor intensity in agriculture (or constraints on land development, as in&#13;
Malaysia) it is difficult to obtain an increase in (nonresidual) agricultural&#13;
employment which exceeds 1 percent a year. If half the labor force is in&#13;
agriculture and the objective is to absorb labor productively at a rate of&#13;
3 percent a year, this implies an absorption of 5 percent a year, outside&#13;
agriculture. Assuming an employment elasticity of 0.5, this implies a&#13;
nonagricultural GDP growth of 10 percent a year, and an overall economic&#13;
growth (including 5 percent for agriculture) of 8.5-9 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Sectoral and Regional Aspects&#13;
Short of advising all countries to attempt to grow as fast as Korea,&#13;
what useful suggestions can be made? If an important poverty group consists&#13;
of owner-cultivators, agricultural development can be an essential elemert in&#13;
the poverty reduction strategy. The focus should then be on the poorest&#13;
farmers. In Thailand, for instance, further development of relatively rich&#13;
rural areas will contribute little (and then only indirectly, see below) to&#13;
the eradication of poverty. On the other hand, increasing the incomes of the&#13;
marginal farmers, as a group, in the North and Northeast would also improve&#13;
the situation of the poor in Bangkok. Unfortunately, for one important group&#13;
of farmers, those on rainfed poor soils, technology packages have been slow to&#13;
materialize, and the methods by which their incomes can be increased are&#13;
therefore not clear./2 For farmers on richer, and often irrigated soils,&#13;
technological solutions are clearer. Unless these lands are very evenly&#13;
distributed, however, the landless rather than those farmers form the major&#13;
poverty group. (The Korean example illustrates the importance of timely&#13;
land reform. Once the typical farm size falls below a certain minimum, as&#13;
it has in Java, land redistribution becomes problematical).    To the extent&#13;
that improved conditions for the less poor who own some land can increase&#13;
demand for hired labor and also help to keep landowners and their children&#13;
on farms and out of the labor market, agricultural development for the&#13;
higher income group of farmers can improve the conditions of the poor. Thus a&#13;
carefully conceived agricultural development policy can and must play a&#13;
leading role in an integrated antipoverty strategy.&#13;
Agricultural and food prices present another very important issue.&#13;
Two of the five countries (Thailand and Korea) have let their domestic food&#13;
prices deviate substantially from international levels, but in opposite&#13;
directions. Yet both have been successful in the alleviation of poverty. In&#13;
Korea, farm-price supports for grains (only partly paid by consumers) have&#13;
increased farm incomes substantially, both directly and via their incentive&#13;
effect on production. In Thailand, the opposite has occurred, with severe&#13;
repurcussions on the group of very poor farmers growing rice under rainfed&#13;
conditions and unable to diversify.&#13;
On the other side of the argument, comparison of labor incomes to poverty&#13;
lines in all five countries has shown the importance of low food prices for&#13;
the poor. Considering also, however, that farm price supports can benefit the&#13;
urban poor to the extent that they keep people on the farm and therefore&#13;
tighten the labor market, the balance of the argument tends to come out in&#13;
favor of farm prices set at least at international levels. This conclusion is&#13;
strengthened if the possibility is recognized of intervention in the markets&#13;
2. This is not true for tree crops. There financial resources or a lack of&#13;
public implementation capacity are generally the constraint.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
for poor men's foods. In this connection it should be pointed out that until&#13;
recently some governments (for example, in Indonesia) have emphasized rice&#13;
production over the production of cheaper foods. Apart from foodgrains,&#13;
governments have influenced other agricultural prices, the export tax on&#13;
rubber in Malaysia (which has been a heavy burden on poor smallholders) being&#13;
a clear example.&#13;
With regard to other sectors, manufacturing is second only to agriculture&#13;
in importance for the alleviation of poverty. Its historic role is well known&#13;
in the creation of employment not only in Korea but also in Taiwan and in the&#13;
city-states of Hong Kong and Singapore, and to a lesser extent in Malaysia.&#13;
In the manufacturing sector, labor intensity is an essential requirement, and&#13;
the East Asia region also contains two examples of lack of success in this&#13;
area (Indonesia and the Philippines). Experience also indicates that the&#13;
multiplier and other indirect effects of development of light industry are&#13;
substantial.&#13;
Policies in other sectors, such as power and transport, are also impor-&#13;
tant because they absorb major parts of scarce investment resources. A theme&#13;
that recurs in a number of countries is the importance of communications,&#13;
especially rural roads, for the alleviation of poverty (through opening new&#13;
areas, decreasing transport and marketing margins, and spreading resources).&#13;
Another strategic question concerns rural and regional development: it is&#13;
argued in all countries (in my view convincingly) that placing economic&#13;
activity, and especially manufacturing, in the countryside will significantly&#13;
enhance its local multipliers and will therefore be important for the alle-&#13;
viation of poverty. Experience in Japan and Taiwan supports the argument.&#13;
However, this appears to be a case where private and social gains may diverge,&#13;
and few regional policy successes can documented in the five countries. This&#13;
issue deserves substantial attention in the context of integrated antipoverty&#13;
strategies.&#13;
Basic Needs and Human Resource Aspects&#13;
In this paper I have not dwelled on the possible tradeoffs between human&#13;
resource development and economic growth. Considering the very high payoff&#13;
that rapid economic development has had in terms of human welfare in East&#13;
Asia, and considering also the fact that, except perhaps in Indonesia, this&#13;
growth does not appear to have been constrained by human resource factors, the&#13;
temptation is great to give priority to growth and to let it furnish the&#13;
resources for human resource development. However, anyone who reviews the&#13;
growing body of evidence on the transmission of poverty from generation to&#13;
generation through malnutrition and undereducation of children cannot fail to&#13;
be impressed by it. Intervention in this area therefore appears well&#13;
warranted, and the five countries can probably afford them. The question is&#13;
how effective they can be. Conclusions should not be drawn hastily, but the&#13;
fact that simple curative health services in the countryside appear to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
suffer from underutilization in several countries gives food for thought.&#13;
Preventive health measures should probably receive priority, but that is&#13;
easier said than done.&#13;
With regard to education, wage differences between skilled and unskilled&#13;
workers seem to have decreased in some of the countries. Whether this helps&#13;
or hurts the poor remains to be seen.   In some cases (rice production and&#13;
infant mortality in Thailand, for example), the direct impact of education&#13;
on welfare seems great. The question is whether the desired effects can be&#13;
achieved using shortcuts or whether only full education can do that. There&#13;
is also the question of the undereducated older people being left behind in&#13;
the countryside: can education do anything for them? I have found no easy&#13;
answers to these questions.&#13;
The Bank's Work and Country Relations&#13;
Since the World Bank started to address the basic question of poverty,&#13;
progress has been made in defining and analyzing the problem. Still, much&#13;
remains to be done. Considering that so many factors and policies that&#13;
influence the welfare of the poor, what has been missing is an integrated&#13;
approach to the problem, one in which the right hand indeed knows what the&#13;
left one is doing. If substantive efforts are to be made to help the&#13;
client countries in the development of integrated strategies that are&#13;
substantially centered around the poverty problem, this subject needs much&#13;
more attention.&#13;
Successful analysis and policy formulation however depend on improved&#13;
information on the actual situation and trends. In this paper, I have&#13;
attempted to show that we still know very little about poverty and its&#13;
causes and even less about changes in the real incomes of the poor. Large&#13;
periodic surveys are undertaken in the countries, but major questions&#13;
surround the accuracy of the observations, and the manipulation of large&#13;
data sets has proven to be difficult. Micro-studies have their own&#13;
limitations, but it is my impression that much more could be learned from&#13;
them, and from careful longitudinal observation of the lives of poor people,&#13;
even if the sample is small. Improved information demands intensive&#13;
collaboration with researchers in the countries.    In this context, the&#13;
Bank's Living Standard Measurement Study is urgent and timely.&#13;
However, it is questionable whether the Bank can make decisive contri-&#13;
butions toward the observation of poverty trends and the formulation and&#13;
execution of integrated antipoverty strategies with its present level of&#13;
manpower and expertise. It appears to me that significant progress can be&#13;
made only if, in close collaboration between client countrles and the Bank,&#13;
a minimal critical mass of analytical talent is deployed and permanently&#13;
assigned to analyze poverty issues in each country or group of countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
To be successful, such a technical effort needs to be supported by periodic&#13;
review at high level meetings between the country and the Bank.&#13;
Are Integrated Antipoverty Strategies Necessary?&#13;
But why should all the above be attempted? Is it really necessary&#13;
to develop and implement integrated anti-poverty strategies to succeed in&#13;
gradually eliminating poverty?   Perhaps not.   The Kuznets curve is there to&#13;
show that after a period of getting worse, income distribution will tend to&#13;
get better. Apart from that it can also be argued that, historically, major&#13;
changes have not often come about in a planned manner. Perhaps it is no more&#13;
than a technocrat's dream that broad strategies could be developed and&#13;
implemented to attain such changes.&#13;
In my view, however, the evidence presented in this paper clearly shows&#13;
that a specific focus on poverty in the review and initiation of both general&#13;
as well as more narrowly focused socioeconomic policies would not fail to make&#13;
the overall policy package more consistent and effective in getting to grips&#13;
with poverty. Given the importance of this issue to many millions of people,&#13;
it appears that the cost of such an effort can be very small in relation to&#13;
the potential gains.&#13;
The experiences discussed in this paper give little cause for compla-&#13;
cency. In the five countries and over two decades (for 10 "countrydecades"&#13;
together), poverty was reduced only in six. Two of these successes (in&#13;
Thailand) were linked to continued land availability, (a favorable factor now&#13;
ending) and one (in Indonesia) was partly related to a recovery from a period&#13;
of disastrous economic management. The "score" thus stands at about&#13;
fifty-fifty in a period characterized by unprecedented worldwide economic&#13;
growth. While population growth has indeed been reduced very significantly&#13;
since then, the labor force will continue to grow rapidly in nearly all the&#13;
countries. There then appears to be a significant risk of stagnating or even&#13;
falling labor incomes in East Asia, with inequalities and perhaps even&#13;
absolute poverty increasing. It appears imperative to attempt to minimize&#13;
that risk.&#13;

Appendix A&#13;
The Concept of Poverty and Its Limitations&#13;
Once poverty is seen as a problem,/1 policymakers must assess its overall&#13;
severity and the urgency of dealing with it, identify the poor, and track&#13;
changes in the welfare of different poverty groups. Ideally, information&#13;
should then be collected at designated times about each individual's ability&#13;
to satisfy his or her basic human needs. This implies setting standards for&#13;
the satisfaction of these needs. Because it is impractical to look at all&#13;
needs, income is used as a convenient indicator of welfare, and the standard&#13;
to be set becomes one for income. This limits the methodology in that&#13;
income, cannot satisfy all needs. Those needs individuals cannot provide for&#13;
themselves then have to be examined separately (the Bank is doing this in&#13;
the context of work on Basic Needs).&#13;
The Bank's methodology sets income standards with reference to&#13;
food intake. Theoretically, such standards specify sufficient quantities&#13;
of calories, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, but in&#13;
practice, in view of the varied diets consumed in East Asia, attention has&#13;
focused on caloric needs./2    Caloric standards are difficult to set, however,&#13;
malnutrition has been prevalent and a large part of the population has not&#13;
attained its physical potential. Standards based on the attainment of that&#13;
potential overstate the individual's daily food needs while criteria based&#13;
on actual body weight understate them. This problem has not been solved.&#13;
Another limitation of the methodology arises be'cause the unit of&#13;
observation in income and expenditure surveys is the household rather than&#13;
the individual. The satisfaction of individual needs is not measured.&#13;
Moreover, in some studies, the income distribution is compiled on the basis&#13;
of total household incomes. This leads to heavily biased results since&#13;
household size is not properly accounted for./3 Even if household incomes&#13;
1. The conceptual and measurement problems of poverty are discussed in more&#13;
detail in C. Grootaert, "Methodological Issues in the Identification of the&#13;
Poor" World Bank (December 1979).&#13;
2. In some geographical areas, too few of certain elements are consumed.&#13;
Correcting such deficiencies, which is seldom costly, should be part of a&#13;
basic needs strategy.&#13;
3. In one study, it was shown that 70 percentage of the households change&#13;
income decile in moving from a household to a per capita household income&#13;
distribution. It is now well established that the latter is the more&#13;
relevant one, even though there are economies of scale in running a&#13;
household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Appendix A&#13;
are converted to per capita incowes,/4 the theoretical adequacy of average&#13;
income per household member is tested not the satisfaction of individual&#13;
household members'needs. Recently, evidence has accumulated that within&#13;
households there are significant disparities in welfare, with children and&#13;
often also women being less well provided for. Again, this aspect, omitted&#13;
from conventional poverty analyses, should be taken into account separately&#13;
in policy formulation.&#13;
Apart from the practical limitations on the poverty concept, there&#13;
is the more fundamental question whether or not the application of general&#13;
standards to specific households or individuals can lead to valid conclu-&#13;
sions. For instance, households differ in composition and size. Young&#13;
children have smaller needs than adults, and the satisfation of at least&#13;
some needs (housing, for example) is subject to economies of scale. Since&#13;
both the number of small children and the size of the household tend to be&#13;
negatively correlated with per capita household income, the combined effect&#13;
of these two factors can be significant./5&#13;
Important questions have also been raised recently about interpersonal&#13;
and intrapersonal /6 variations in the need for food.    To the extent that an&#13;
individual's reduced need for food leads to reduced intake and causes him to&#13;
be identified as poor, measurement errors will occur.&#13;
Finally, the poverty concept as applied by the Bank divides the&#13;
population into just two groups, the poor and the nonpoor, resulting in the&#13;
loss of information about relative degrees of poverty.. To begin to deal&#13;
with this problem, at least one further distinction should be made -- between&#13;
the poor and the very poor.&#13;
Practical Problems in the Measurement of Poverty&#13;
In the study and measurement of poverty in the five countries, practical&#13;
as well as theoretical problems also arise, especially in setting the&#13;
poverty line income and in applying the poverty line to survey data.&#13;
4. This needs to be done for each household separately, rather than for&#13;
grouped data.   It is a complicated conversion, which statistical offices&#13;
are not always well equipped to make.&#13;
5. Where investigated, the effect of the conversion to adult consumption&#13;
equivalents on poverty incidence has been found to be limited; the second&#13;
factor has seldom been investigated.&#13;
6. In the sense that an individual's food needs move along cyclical patterns&#13;
of several weeks or longer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
A poverty line is not difficult to set if it can be based on an&#13;
income and expenditure survey that includes not only information on amounts&#13;
spent on the items consumed but also on the quantities consumed or prices&#13;
paid. It is then possible to convert the quantities of food consumed by the&#13;
various income groups into calories, determine the income level at which&#13;
sufficient calories are consumed, and draw the poverty line accordingly.&#13;
While everything still hinges on the quality of the survey, this method at&#13;
least provides a consistent framework for estimating poverty.&#13;
Among the five countries, such survey materials are available only for&#13;
Indonesia./7 Even there, only limited rural-urban regional disaggregation&#13;
has been possible. In the other countries, prices of major consumption&#13;
items had to be estimated from separate sources, and in none of them were&#13;
these price data sufficiently disaggregated by regions and rural-urban areas&#13;
to allow the accurate reflection of geographical variations in the cost of&#13;
living. As long as lack of information precludes the full incorporation of&#13;
this factor in intracountry poverty comparisons, they must be severely&#13;
qualified./8&#13;
In addition to the question of price differentials, the question also&#13;
arises about the quality of the items consumed. For rice, the major staple&#13;
in the region, the prices of different grades sold in a rural market can vary&#13;
by 20-25 percent, with broken rice falling well outside this range. The&#13;
poor may also substitute other cereals for rice. For animal proteins, the&#13;
range of qualities and prices is perhaps even wider. The absence of detailed&#13;
information on the specific items consumed by various income groups thus&#13;
introduces substantial ucertainty in estimating the poverty line. To&#13;
overcome these difficulties a "poor-man's diet" (including qualities) can be&#13;
postulated and priced. Such an approach, however, fails to take account of&#13;
the specific cultural, social, and economic conditions under which the poor&#13;
decide their consumption pattern, and therefore mDves the whole exercise&#13;
even farther away from reality. These difficulties are compounded when an&#13;
attempt is made to make real income comparisons over time. Yet, without&#13;
such comparisons, how are trends to be assessed in the real incomes of the&#13;
poor in relation to the "average" consumer? And what to do if price&#13;
7. Surveys in some other countries have collected, but have not fully&#13;
processed, data on quantities.&#13;
8. Evidence has been accumulating that there are wide rural-urban and&#13;
regional disparities in price levels, which are often correlated with&#13;
variations in incomes. The uniform application of national or even&#13;
rural-urban poverty lines will lead to biased results (mostly in the&#13;
direction of overestimation of the incidence of poverty and variations&#13;
therein).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Appendix A&#13;
movements are at least implicitly available (as in Indonesia) but the&#13;
quality of the food basket changes over time? That these are not only&#13;
esoteric questions of statistical methodology is evidenced by the fact that&#13;
the outcome of the debate on what has happened to the "real" incomes of&#13;
Indonesia's poorest partly hinges on the answer to this question.&#13;
With regard to the applciation of the poverty line to survey data,&#13;
surveys always show national income and expenditure totals 20-40 percel.t&#13;
below those in the National Accounts.   Most practitioners feel tha. the&#13;
National Accounts, partly based on observed commodity flows, are to be&#13;
preferred. The surveys are generally presumed to be underestimated at the&#13;
top of the income distribution and perhaps also at the bottom (because of&#13;
understimated income and consumption in kind). This may bias the estimate&#13;
of the total incidence of poverty as well as its breakdown over various&#13;
groups. These biases may be exacerbated when successive surveys are compared&#13;
to establish true trends. This danger is ignored when the usual assumption&#13;
is made that the various biases remain the same over time, but this&#13;
assumption is more difficult to maintain if the national accounts show&#13;
different trends.&#13;
Apart from the above questions of measurement, infrequently taken&#13;
surveys cannot deal satisfactorily with short-run variation in income,&#13;
whether due to incidental factors affecting many households (such as the&#13;
weather) or to purely stochastic factors affecting individual households.&#13;
If incidental influences are large (for example, the Thai survey of 1972-73)&#13;
the results have to be discarded. However, the weather is seldom completely&#13;
"normal"; unrecognized variations in it can significantly influence the&#13;
outcome for the rural poor. Stochastic factors work differently, causing an&#13;
unknown number of households in any particular survey to be counted as poor,&#13;
when on an average of two-to-five years' income they are not poor./9&#13;
Finally, over the longer term, the life cycle effect may cause households to&#13;
be temporarily poor (especially while the children are small), while over&#13;
the longer term they are not. All this is not to belittle the problems of&#13;
uncertainty or illiquidity, which may be severe for persons whose incomes are&#13;
temporarily low but who are, over a longer period, not clearly in poverty.&#13;
Uncertainty and fear should actually be recognized as negative welfata.    In&#13;
addition, income fluctuations can have permanent effects if, for example,&#13;
land has to be sold. Nevertheless, temporary poverty is different from&#13;
permanent poverty, and its alleviation needs different policy interventions.&#13;
9. This short-term variability in incomes may be one reason why annual&#13;
surveys disclose so much dissaving among the poor, which is not sustainable&#13;
over a longer period. If not, it would have to be concluded that the&#13;
incomes of the poor are indeed systematically underestimated (see page ..).&#13;

In summary, the poverty concept and its practical application&#13;
suffer from many shortcomings. The current statistical base is just too&#13;
thin, and its extention deserves a high priority. In the meantime, micro&#13;
studies and other corroborative evidence should be used judiciously to&#13;
identify poverty and its trends. Pending improvements in the data base,&#13;
much of the discussion in this paper is tentative.&#13;

Appendix B&#13;
Actual Poverty Line Estimates&#13;
Poverty lines, as estimated in the course of country economic work,/1 are&#13;
listed in Table BI.   They have been converted into 1977 prices, and assume a&#13;
uniform caloric intake of 2,100 kilocalories per day. To facilitate com-&#13;
parison, data on the caloric composition of the diet and on food prices are&#13;
also included. No detailed review of these data is intended here, but a few&#13;
things stand out. With regard to prices, the high domestic rice price in&#13;
Korea is clearly reflected in the poverty line estimates, as is the low price&#13;
of rice (and other foods) in Thailand.   In the latter country, however, the&#13;
poverty line is unduly low because the assumed main staple in the diet is&#13;
100 percentage broken rice, which in fact is rarely used for human consump-&#13;
tion. With regard to the quality of the diets, there are relatively large&#13;
differences in the amounts of (expensive) animal proteins included, with the&#13;
Korean diet being particularly austere. A more uniform reliance on consump-&#13;
tion of animal protein in the diets would make a difference.L2 So would the&#13;
inclusion of spices, beverages, and tobacco in the Thai diet. Also, assuming&#13;
roughly equal textile prices between the countries, the amounts included in&#13;
Indonesia appear unduly low. Finally, although this is more speculative,&#13;
the amounts provided for "other" items in the Philippines appear to be on&#13;
the high side.&#13;
At the bottom of Table B1 the country poverty lines are roughly&#13;
adjusted for the above factors so as to enable their comparison. Still&#13;
these poverty line estimates leave much to be desired, especially with&#13;
regard to the urban-rural split, which for most countries does not have a&#13;
reasonably firm statistical base (see Appendix A, page 46). In this&#13;
connection it is perhaps significant that for Indonesia, where the data used&#13;
are at least internally consistent, the urban-rural differential is much&#13;
larger than for the other countries. In general, it appears likely that, at&#13;
least for cities, the price differential with the rural areas is larger than&#13;
those numbers indicate. In contrast, the intercountry variations, based&#13;
largely on food price differentials, and on higher needs for clothing and&#13;
shelter in Korea, appear reasonably firm.&#13;
1. In the case of Korea, they are based on a Bank-supported project of the&#13;
Korea Development Institute. _&#13;
2. On the other hand, there are undeniable cultural influences on the&#13;
composition of the diets.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Objectives of the Paper. This paper discusses the major human&#13;
resource problems in Africa south of the Sahara and suggests a possible role&#13;
for the Bank in assisting governments to alleviate them. It is argued that&#13;
the lack of human resources constitutes the major constraint on the develop-&#13;
ment of the region and that the strategies for removing this constraint should&#13;
involve (a) a strengthening of public administration at both central and local&#13;
government levels; (b) greater efforts at manpower development to improve&#13;
the absorptive capacity of the modern sector and, equally important (c)&#13;
formal and non-formal education programs associated with programs in health,&#13;
sanitation, nutrition, family planning and water supplies, to transform the&#13;
cultural characteristics of individuals and groups in rural areas--in short,&#13;
to create in rural areas, a healthy human agent capable of perceiving and&#13;
acting upon the opportunities for economic improvement provided by modern&#13;
science and technology.&#13;
The Setting. Almost all of the 42 countries in this region became&#13;
independent national entities in the 1960's. Unfortunately, part of their&#13;
legacy from the colonial period were boundaries which were determined with&#13;
little regard to their political and economic viability. Almost without&#13;
exception, the new states were not politically cohesive; individuals identified,&#13;
with their tribal groups more than with their new "nationality" and national&#13;
boundaries often bisected tribal areas. The political cohesiveness and the&#13;
governability of the new states were further handicapped by poor communications;&#13;
most countries have a number of indigenous languages (Nigeria has over 300)&#13;
which makes inter group communications difficult. Moreover, poor roads denied&#13;
the poorest groups in rural areas access to the few government services which&#13;
existed, such as health and education services which are associated with&#13;
national governments and which could contribute to establishing political&#13;
constituencies and a sense of common nationality.&#13;
The physical isolation of the preponderant majorities of the new&#13;
countries' populations has served to reinforce the traditional rural social&#13;
and economic organizations, the basic unit of which is usually the village.&#13;
Typically, in the villages, councils composed of the noblest and richest&#13;
members, headed by a chief, exercise control over the lives of the villagers,&#13;
including the division of labor and the distribution of products. At indepen-&#13;
dence, these councils were the effective level of government for most Africans.&#13;
While improvements in communications, and central government efforts to foster&#13;
economic, social and political development have altered the traditional social&#13;
and economic organization in many rural areas, these organizations still play&#13;
an important role in most peoples' lives.&#13;
In some countries, such as Mali, the central government has conscious-&#13;
ly reinforced the powers of local councils as part of its political and economic&#13;
development efforts. In Kenya, leadership in local councils has, since long&#13;
before independence, served as a basis for entry into national politics. In&#13;
fact, Kenya's local councils have, traditionally, taken the initiative from the&#13;
central government in development efforts, particularly in the establishment&#13;
of schools. In Nigeria, the powers of traditional rural social organizations&#13;
have both consciously and unconsciously been diminished, partly as a result&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
of efforts to create greater national unity, but also as a consequence of&#13;
the mobility of the rural population made possible by rapid growth in the&#13;
modern urban sector, agricultural stagnation and by an extended family&#13;
system with households in both the villages and in the towns which facili-&#13;
tates migration.&#13;
The economies of traditional rural African communities are, of&#13;
course, viable, albeit at some of the lowest levels of living in the world.&#13;
With a subsistence agriculture and physical isolation, some rural communities&#13;
are essentially self-sufficient and largely independent of larger regional&#13;
and national economies, to say nothing of the international economy. How-&#13;
ever, most now produce a cash crop of marketable surplus upon which they are&#13;
dependent for a substantial portion of their income. Unfortunately, ineffi-&#13;
cient markets and government pricing policies, which are often explicitly&#13;
designed to favor the more politically volatile urban workers, diminish the&#13;
benefits which are received by peasant farmers. Also, most African govern-&#13;
ments have traditionally used parastatal marketing boards and administered&#13;
prices to extract a surplus from farmers to finance public sector development&#13;
programs which are often not of direct benefit to farmers.&#13;
Because of their technological backwardness, undeveloped markets&#13;
and inappropriate administered prices, many rural African communities are not&#13;
viable in the sense that they can, without significant technological and&#13;
social change, provide for the basic needs of rural people as these needs&#13;
are defined in terms of nutrition, health, education, housing and water&#13;
supplies. The preponderant reliance of most Africans on subsistence agricul-&#13;
ture accounts for the fact that of the 32 poorest countries in the world, 22&#13;
are in Africa South of the Sahara. In 1977, the 310 million people in the&#13;
region (excluding South Africa) had an annual per capita income of less than&#13;
US$300. In 10 of the countries, per capita income was less than US$150. The&#13;
per capita income of the people dependent upon subsistence agriculture,&#13;
typically comprising 60-90 percent of the population of African countries,&#13;
ranges from about US$100 (in the Sahelian countries) to less than US$200,&#13;
and is largely dependent upon the amount of rainfall and cultivable land&#13;
available.&#13;
In more concrete terms, these levels of living reflect adult illiter-&#13;
acy rates which are the highest in the world (up to 85% in some countries)&#13;
and health conditions which are among the poorest. Crude death rates range&#13;
as high as 30 per thousand and life expectancy averages 41.6 years and is as&#13;
low as 37 years (in some parts of the Sahel). Morbidity rates are very high,&#13;
with children being the most vulnerable group, particularly to malaria, measles&#13;
and malnutrition. Infant mortality rates average 128 per 1,000 live births&#13;
and are, also, the highest in the world.&#13;
The role of government. The agendas of the new African governments&#13;
are formidable, with the first priorities being the achievement of defacto&#13;
political and economic independence and the creation of national unity among&#13;
different groups, the latter involving primarily the establishment of a legiti-&#13;
mate and useful role for government itself, the institution preeminently&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
associated with "nationhood". The achievement of political and economic&#13;
independence has generally been perceived as involving the replacement of&#13;
expatriate administrators and entrepreneurs by technical assistance personnel,&#13;
the accelerated promotion of Africans to senior positions and the indigenization&#13;
in the ownership and staffing of private industry.&#13;
Without exception, the new African governments have promoted national&#13;
unity and a sense of nationhood by using their preeminent powers for marshall-&#13;
ing both internal and external resources to establish their role as agents of&#13;
economic development. Unfortunately, the governments have been severely handi-&#13;
capped in performing a developmental role by the interrelated constraints of&#13;
lack of resources, weak administrations, a paucity of instruments through which&#13;
they may effect economic improvement and uncertainty about what would consti-&#13;
tute a correct development strategy.&#13;
Lack of resources. African governments have typically been unable&#13;
to marshall more than 20 percent of GDP for public sector activities and&#13;
revenues tend not to be buoyant relative to income. Because of the recurrent&#13;
budget implications of past development (capital) outlays, the governments of&#13;
even the richest countries (Nigeria, Gabon, Ivory Coast) are now faced with&#13;
serious financial problems. With both planners and foreign donors very nearly&#13;
exclusively concerned with capital projects, governments have tended to under-&#13;
fund ongoing activities particularly education and road maintenance to finance&#13;
new capital plant, the operation of which, in turn, cannot be adequately funded.&#13;
Only France has assisted some countries by financing substantial proportions&#13;
of their associated recurrent budgets.&#13;
Further, many governments do not use the scarce resources available&#13;
to them very efficiently because of weak economic management and failure to&#13;
introduce technologies and organizations which will economize on these resour-&#13;
ces. For example, a more intensive use of teachers, whose salaries often claim&#13;
30 percent of total government budgets could permit sizeable increases in en-&#13;
rollments at little additional cost. A reorganization of health systems&#13;
toward preventive village-base health services could profoundly improve their&#13;
accessibility and, consequently, their effectiveness, also at little additional&#13;
cost.&#13;
The more serious resource constraint affecting both the public and&#13;
private sectors has been a lack of high and middle level manpower to staff&#13;
existing government programs, much less to expand them.       consequence&#13;
of this scarcity has been that African governments have relied far more&#13;
heavily upon official technical assistance to man the public sector and&#13;
other expatriate personnel to man the private sector than the governments&#13;
of any other region. Removal of the manpower constraint is proving far more&#13;
difficult than originally envisaged. Contrary to earlier perceptions, an&#13;
expansion in the enrollments in and outputs from formal educational and&#13;
training institutions will not automatically assure the effective staffing&#13;
of public and private institutions. The development of adequate career&#13;
structures to provide normal periods of on-the-job training for novices,&#13;
incentive systems, management, discipline and an adequate funding of operations&#13;
are equally important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Further, providing the manpower required for staffing institutions&#13;
which can operate effectively at the village level require, first of all, the&#13;
definition, at least conceptually, of the activities of such institutions and&#13;
the associated manpower profiles. Since few countries have made very much&#13;
progress in planning, much less establishing such institutions, appropriate&#13;
training programs have generally neither been designed nor established.&#13;
Inadequacy of public administration. The public administrations&#13;
of the new governments were established by the colonial powers to maintain&#13;
law and order and to foster the economic exploitation of the continent's&#13;
economic resources. Until shortly before independence, in most countries,&#13;
even expenditures on health and education were essentially aimed at creating&#13;
environmental conditions under which Europeans could work and in establishing&#13;
a productive labor force for foreign commercial and industrial enterprises.&#13;
Very little attention was given to improving the living levels of the great&#13;
majority of Africans residing in rural areas who were almost totally dependent&#13;
upon subsistence agriculture. The new governments were neither sufficiently&#13;
staffed nor properly organized to assume a larger role of fostering more&#13;
rapid and broadly based economic and social development. Moreover, the policy&#13;
instruments were limited to those available to the colonial administration&#13;
which, in the absence of efficient product and factor markets, relied heavily&#13;
upon horizontally integrated public enterprises, administered prices and direct&#13;
controls. The indirect controls through economic incentives, which are avail-&#13;
able to well developed market economies with good communications and entrepre-&#13;
neurial capacity, were regarded as relatively ineffective.&#13;
The public sector was and continues to be heavily dominated by&#13;
these parastatals with their administered prices and direct controls. After&#13;
independence, the new governments expanded the roles of parastatals even&#13;
further to include, particularly in the former French colonies, responsibility&#13;
for regional agricultural development. However, the expansion in the number&#13;
of parastatals often represented attempts to achieve new objectives other than&#13;
an intensification of the pre-independence development strategy which supported&#13;
the commercial exploitation of primary commodities. These new objectives were&#13;
sometimes ideological. For example, a desire on the part of Government for&#13;
greater public ownership of the means for production. Other objectives included&#13;
the promotion of industrial investment through government participation in&#13;
risk, the provision of subsidized services and the creation of employment.&#13;
Too often, the new parastatals did little to transform the lives of the majority&#13;
of Africans; in many countries, some parastatals have become positive liabi-&#13;
lities. They have been used as employers of last resort (particularly in&#13;
Mali and Ghana); they have often been immunized from criteria of profitability&#13;
by government subsidies and, where profitable, surpluses have often been used&#13;
in ways which provide little benefit to rural people (the West African Marketing&#13;
Boards).&#13;
Since independence, the roles and styles of central government&#13;
administrations have reflected the purposes for which they were established&#13;
in the first instance and preeminent among these activities was the management&#13;
and administration of formal school systems. While the point should not be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
stressed, at least partially as a consequence of this specialization, educa-&#13;
tion, in almost all countries, stands second only to defense expenditures in&#13;
its claim on government resources. In Ivory Coast and Nigeria, education&#13;
claims well over 35 percent of the governments' budgets and current plans&#13;
will elevate this proportion even higher.&#13;
More significantly, the health services managed by the public&#13;
administration were set up along European lines very largely to provide&#13;
curative medical care to expatriates, to the priviledged African elite and&#13;
to the modern sector labor force. They are not only too costly to expand&#13;
to cater to the needs of the great majority of Africans in rural areas, but&#13;
they are also incapable of dealing with African health problems which are&#13;
essentially environmental. These environmental problems are both social&#13;
and physical and involve actions to improve sanitation, water, insect control,&#13;
and the elimination of maladaptive practices through health education. In&#13;
Africa, too little progress has been made in establishing and administering&#13;
a health system accessible to villagers.&#13;
The new governments, with a few exceptions, have not been very&#13;
bold in establishing administrative systems and institutions which would&#13;
enable them to have much of an impact upon the rural poor; those countries&#13;
which made bold attempts (most notably Tanzania, Mali and, more recently,&#13;
Benin and Ethiopia) have shown results which are mixed and controversial&#13;
at best in terms of improvements in welfare. They have, nevertheless,&#13;
established the basic institutions and instruments through which governments&#13;
can affect development at the village level.&#13;
Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there has been a&#13;
clear trend in increasing numbers of countries to experiment, on a pilot basis,&#13;
with a variety of forms of new institutions. The Kenya Rural Development&#13;
Scheme, the Promovillage scheme in Ivory Coast and Bank-financed agricultural&#13;
projects in Malawi and Northern Nigeria are examples.&#13;
The generalizations which can be drawn, based on experience with&#13;
these schemes, are:&#13;
(a) there is an emormous eclecticism in the new rural institutions&#13;
which are emerging with differences based largely on ideology and&#13;
social and economic circumstances;&#13;
(b) the success of new institutions depends upon the political&#13;
mobilization of the peasantry and their organization for partici-&#13;
pation in decision-making to overcome their fears of victimization&#13;
by the wealthy;&#13;
(c) the activities of new rural institutions are multisectoral and&#13;
depend upon the coordination between,and strong administrative and&#13;
logistical support from,the traditional ministries in the central&#13;
government. Almost without exception, the new institutions suffer&#13;
from weaknesses of the central government in these areas;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
(d)  lack of management and technical skills at all levels of adminis-&#13;
tration, including the new administrative institutions, is the&#13;
most serious constraint on the development of the latter;&#13;
(e) the next most serious constraints are a lack of supporting&#13;
resources and inadequate communications;&#13;
(f) finally, the success of new rural institutions depends upon&#13;
close attention to social, economic and political incentives&#13;
which can be provided to engender acceptance of change.&#13;
Experimentation with, and the development of, new administrative&#13;
institutions in support of new agrarian systems will be the most important&#13;
development task of the countries in Africa South of the Sahara during the&#13;
1980s. Human resource development will be the most important objective of&#13;
these new institutions and, conversely, the most important constraint upon&#13;
their development.&#13;
Human resource problems. The lack of skills and experience to&#13;
man the modern public and private sectors has always been regarded as the&#13;
major constraint on economic development in Africa and, hence, the most&#13;
serious human resource problem. Other types of human resource problems,&#13;
such as health, nutrition, basic and general education, were usually&#13;
regarded to be of secondary importance -- problems which would be solved&#13;
more or less automatically if the constraint on development imposed by lack&#13;
of skilled manpower were removed. Implicit in this development strategy&#13;
was the conviction that the development and spread of the modern sector,&#13;
including modern plantation agriculture, would, through incentives provided&#13;
by the growing and increasingly efficient factor and product markets, trans-&#13;
form the traditional economies of rural areas. Another part of the strategy&#13;
was that priority should be given, except for manpower development, to&#13;
directly productive activities which would produce resources for further&#13;
development. The strategy had considerable respectability, being strongly&#13;
endorsed by influential academic and practicing development economists.&#13;
Fortunately, for the African governments which considered this&#13;
strategy, it was the type of development with which their administrations&#13;
could most easily deal. Unfortunately, especially in a region where the&#13;
proportion of people deriving their livelihoods from subsistence agriculture&#13;
was the highest in the world, the strategy, where adopted, does not seem to&#13;
have worked very well.&#13;
Evidence strongly suggests that the incidence of poverty in Africa&#13;
has either been static or has increased absolutely during the last 10 years&#13;
(Section II). Most governments were unable or unwilling to adhere to all of&#13;
the priorities dictated by the accepted economic scenario. In response to&#13;
popular demand, almost all were politically compelled to spend heavily on&#13;
primary and general education. Some, notably Tanzania and Mali, have since&#13;
independence, concentrated their efforts on the transformation of traditionAl&#13;
rural institutions. In this context, Mali has given priority to the develop-&#13;
ment of human resources in rural areas and has devoted considerable effort to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
the creation of the political and economic institutions through which this&#13;
might be accomplished.&#13;
The gradual realization of failure to ameliorate poverty in rural&#13;
areas has prompted a reexamination of the accepted set of development priori-&#13;
ties in almost all countries in the region. Throughout the region, a new&#13;
set of priorities has been emerging which places emphasis on village-based&#13;
rural development and investments in human resources at the village level,&#13;
particularly basic education, health and nutrition. The strengthening of&#13;
central government services through reorganization and greater, although&#13;
somewhat differently oriented, manpower development schemes are increasingly&#13;
regarded as important to provide the support required for the implementation&#13;
of the new strategy.&#13;
Further, the role in development of basic and general education,&#13;
health and nutrition are being reexamined and, while there remains consider-&#13;
able, though diminishing, controversy, donor agencies have generally accepted&#13;
these areas as having priority. The unresolved controversies generally&#13;
center on the argument that directly productive activities are preferable to&#13;
those which are not, on the economic benefits from human resource investments&#13;
other than manpower training and the complementarities between different&#13;
kind of human resource investments, on the one hand, and between human&#13;
resource investments and investments in directly productive activities on&#13;
the other. Because of their complexity, these issues do not promise early&#13;
resolution.&#13;
The following sections of this paper discuss human resource&#13;
development in the region under the following headings: Poverty in Africa;&#13;
Evidence of Failure; Manpower Development; Issues in Education; Health and&#13;
Population and, finally, The Role of the Bank in Improving Human Resources&#13;
in the Region.&#13;
Confusion about appropriate development strategies. Because of&#13;
the failure of the social sciences to resolve the issues concerning the&#13;
relationship of human resources to development satisfactorily, governments&#13;
have few guidelines to assist them in the formulation of overall development&#13;
strategies. However, what is clear is that the objectives of an overall&#13;
development strategy are the most important determinants of the priorities&#13;
assigned to different human resource investments.&#13;
For example, a strategy which is aimed at maximizing the growth in&#13;
GNP would give a high priority to directly productive activities in the&#13;
modern sector including large plantation agriculture. The appropriate&#13;
complementary educational investments would favor secondary and tertiary&#13;
levels of education, and technical and vocational training to support a&#13;
largely urban based industrial development. In health, priorities would&#13;
be given to a largely urban based system and to the maintenance of the&#13;
health of productive adults. It is usually believed that the cost of select-&#13;
ing this strategy is a growing inequality in the distribution of income&#13;
between urban workers and the preponderous majority living in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Those who favor this strategy argue that the rapid growth in GNP will provide&#13;
the resource base which would later enable governments to adapt policies&#13;
favorable to the rural poor.&#13;
A development strategy which would result in a different set of human&#13;
resource investment priorities might regard human resources as the ultimate&#13;
basis of national wealth and increases in GNP a consequence of the development&#13;
and efficient use of these resources. This strategy would entail investments&#13;
in the health and education of the entire population and would regard small&#13;
increases in income of the rural majorities as important as relatively specta-&#13;
cular increases in total income in one or more of the modern sectors. In the&#13;
education sector, this strategy would give priority to basic education in&#13;
rural areas and, in the health sector, to village based systems emphasizing&#13;
maternal and child health.&#13;
In Africa, the countries which have most closely approximated the&#13;
former strategy are Ivory Coast, Gabon, Kenya, Zaire and Zambia and the latter&#13;
strategy, Tanzania, Somalia, Ethiopia, the Central African Republic and, more&#13;
recently, Benin. At the outset, the choice of strategy in each case appears&#13;
to have been as closely related to ideology as to an analysis of the economic&#13;
and social consequences of choosing one strategy over another. More recently,&#13;
changes and alterations in strategy have been based upon experience and lean&#13;
very strongly in favor of the human resource development strategy.&#13;
Given the low level of human resource development in Africa and&#13;
its general relationship to rural poverty, a strong case can be made for&#13;
favoring a general human resource development strategy in most African&#13;
countries. The following sections of this paper show that African countries&#13;
significantly lag behind countries in other regions in terms of major indica-&#13;
tors of human resource development and that, not coincidentally, Africa&#13;
contains the poorest people in the world.&#13;
Unfortunately, it is difficult to make generalizations about the&#13;
connections between human resource investments, in particular investments in&#13;
education and health, and improvements in income and the alleviation of poverty;&#13;
this is one of the serious shortcomings of a broadly based human resource de-&#13;
velopment strategy. However, while it is known that improving skills and&#13;
knowledge in rural working environments can be an effective, perhaps the&#13;
most effective, means for alleviating poverty, it is also known that such&#13;
improvements can be expensive and difficult, normally requiring complementary&#13;
investments in technical manpower and new organizations which in turn make&#13;
demands on already weak administrations and on the overburdened education&#13;
and training systems. While there is some evidence that formal education&#13;
can improve farmer productivity, to say nothing of having impacts on fertility&#13;
and health practices, it also usually results in migration from rural areas&#13;
and less than the desired impact on agricultural productivity. It is also&#13;
known that investments in a health service accessible to villages can be a&#13;
particularly attractive means for improving the welfare of the poorest people&#13;
but, like investments in rural skills, they are difficult to implement and&#13;
require complementary investments in technical manpower and in new organiza-&#13;
tions.&#13;

II. POVERTY IN AFRICA: EVIDENCE OF FAILURE&#13;
The statistical evidence on poverty and income inequality in Africa&#13;
South of the Sahara is limited. However limited, it suggests that (a) poverty&#13;
has grown in incidence and income inequalities have increased over the last&#13;
decade, (b) poverty is primarily a rural problem and its incidence among&#13;
people in rural areas does not differ much among countries at different&#13;
levels of development. Roughly 60 percent of the rural population of African&#13;
countries are poor and these comprise, almost entirely, subsistence and small&#13;
scale farmers, (c) poverty measures relating to nutrition, sanitation, water&#13;
supplies, health and education indicate that rural Africa contains the poorest&#13;
people in the world and, with respect to nutrition, may be retrogressing,&#13;
(d) income inequalities are among the highest in the world and appear to be,&#13;
in some countries, increasing, (e) in recent years, agricultural output grew&#13;
at a slower rate than population growth in the poorest countries and barely&#13;
kept pace with population growth in the middle income countries. This de-&#13;
velopment suggests that the incidence of poverty may be growing in the rural&#13;
areas of many African countries.&#13;
The Incidence of Poverty&#13;
Poverty may be defined in two ways. It can be defined in terms of&#13;
some minimum income level or in terms of the minimum consumption of specified&#13;
goods and services. Using 1969 data, and assuming that an annual income of&#13;
less than US$75 constituted poverty, a World Bank study concluded that 60&#13;
percent of the population was poor. Using 1972 data and defining poverty&#13;
as persons with incomes less than US$117, an ILO study found that 65 percent&#13;
of the population on the continent may be considered poverty-stricken.&#13;
More recently, a Bank study, using mostly 1975 data, found- that many African&#13;
countries had a poverty incidence of at least 50 percent.&#13;
Studies of household consumption in selected countries either tend&#13;
to confirm the estimates of poverty incidence based on income levels or&#13;
suggest that such estimates may, in fact, be underestimates. The results of&#13;
household survey data from 6 countries are shown in Table 2.1. Consumption&#13;
studies indicate that when 50 percent of income from all sources is used&#13;
for food, the household is in a state of poverty. If 70 percent is used&#13;
for food, a household is suffering extreme deprivation. The household&#13;
survey data therefore indicate that the incidence of rural poverty in&#13;
Africa is much higher than the 60 percent generally estimated by using&#13;
income data alone.&#13;

The Kenya and Ghana household survey data are particularly alarming&#13;
for they were derived from relatively rich areas with long established cash&#13;
cropping and show that an unexpectedly large proportion of the populations&#13;
are in extreme poverty.&#13;
In another study undertaken at the ILO by Assefa Bequela and Rolf&#13;
van der Hoeven, an attempt was made to define minimum "baskets' of goods and&#13;
services and to price them for 7 African countries, for urban and rural areas,&#13;
at different levels of development. The results are shown in Table 2.1. The&#13;
study tends to confirm estimates of the incidence of poverty based upon income&#13;
base lines and, moreover, underscores the essentially rural character of poverty.&#13;
Nutrition data from the FAO show that a basic indicator of poverty,&#13;
the shortage of food, is widespread on the African continent. In 16 of the&#13;
24 countries listed in Table 2.3, at least 30 percent of the population was&#13;
undernourished in the period 1972/74. Moreover, the incidence of undernourish-&#13;
ment increased between the two dates in 13 of the 24 countries, was unchanged&#13;
in 5 and declined in 6. The increased incidence was particularly sharp in&#13;
the Sahelian countries which, during this period, were suffering the worst&#13;
drought in recent history.&#13;
An indicator that the incidence of poverty may have grown during&#13;
the last decade is the data available on the real wages of agricultural&#13;
workers in 6 African countries. The time series in Table 2.4 show that the&#13;
real wages of agricultural workers declined in all 6 countries over the&#13;
periods for which they were recorded.&#13;
Income inequality. Estimates of income inequality in Africa reveal&#13;
some surprises. It is generally believed that there is little inequality&#13;
among African peasants and that mass poverty are results of primitive techno-&#13;
logies and social and environmental constraints. Bank sector studies on&#13;
Health in Mali and Agriculture in Chad and Mali tend to confirm this belief&#13;
by showing that a kind of population arbritage equalizes per capita incomes&#13;
between areas with high rainfall and good soil fertility and low rainfall&#13;
and poor soil fertility. Comparisons of per capita incomes between areas,&#13;
of course, reveal little about the distribution of income among households&#13;
within areas.&#13;
Table 2.5 shows the Gini coefficients for households and income&#13;
earners for 13 African countries. The coefficients for rural Lesotho,&#13;
Sierra Leone, Zambia and Sudan are not significantly different from those&#13;
found in Asia; the coefficient for Botswana is high even by Asian standards.&#13;
The income inequality estimates tend to be confirmed by comparable&#13;
estimates of land concentration shown in Table 2.6. These data show that in&#13;
5 of the 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the degree of land concentration&#13;
was higher than in countries such as Sri Lanka, Thailand and South Korea.&#13;
The data presented and other studies show that there are great&#13;
differences among African countries in the degree of income inequality. In-&#13;
come inequalities in such countries as Gabon, Kenya, Swaziland and Zambia are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
among the bighest in the world. In Zambia, in 1974, both the richest 2 per-&#13;
cent and the poorest 50 percent claimed 20 percent of total income each. In&#13;
Swaziland, in 1974, 24 percent of the total wage bill was paid to expatriate&#13;
workers comprising only 5 percent of the work force.&#13;
Another indicator of inequality in Africa is the comparison between&#13;
agricultural and non-agricultural incomes; non-agricultural incomes are 4-9&#13;
times agricultural incomes. All other countries in the world have ratios&#13;
which are lower, 2 and 2.5.&#13;
Trends. Available data give an overall impression of stagnation&#13;
in per capita income in a number of African countries and absolute decline&#13;
in a number of others over the period 1960-1976. Per capita incomes seem&#13;
to have declined in Chad, Somalia, Niger, Madagascar, Senegal and Ghana and&#13;
stagnated in Mali, Rwanda, Upper Volta, Benin, Guinea, Sudan, Uganda and&#13;
the Central African Republic. In over 20 countries, there was a decline&#13;
in per capita food production, by as much as 20 percent in some countries;&#13;
by the late 1970s, Africa had become a larger importer of food on a per capita&#13;
basis than any other region in the world.&#13;

III. MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT&#13;
At independence, the lack of skilled and experienced high and middle-&#13;
level manpower was regarded by African governments as the most serious impedi-&#13;
ment to economic growth, a problem made more serious by the ambitious develop-&#13;
ment plans which most countries embarked on shortly after independence. Many&#13;
of the countries attempted to solve these problems by the most systematic&#13;
means available, beginning with manpower surveys which were to be used as a&#13;
basis for the planning of education and training systems. These surveys, some&#13;
of which were undertaken a number of years after independence, revealed the&#13;
seriousness of the problem. One indicator of the magnitude of manpower short-&#13;
ages was the large proportion of expatriates occupying positions requiring a&#13;
minimum of primary education plus one year of formal training. These are shown&#13;
in Table 3.1.&#13;

The shortages were most serious for high level manpower, i.e., for&#13;
occupations requiring a university degree. In five of the countries surveyed&#13;
(Ivory Coast, Kenya, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zambia), more than 75% of all&#13;
high level manpower were expatriates. In all of the countries except Nigeria&#13;
(39%), Sudan (12%) and Somalia (7%), more than 50% were expatriates. For&#13;
middle-level manpower (occupations requiring a secondary education plus a&#13;
minimum of 2 years of training), shortages were not quite as severe. Never-&#13;
theless, in five of the countries listed above, at least 50% of all jobs in&#13;
this category were occupied by expatriates.&#13;
In terms of occupations, the greatest shortages of high level man-&#13;
power were for doctors, dentists, engineers, architects, managers, accountants,&#13;
agronomists, foresters, livestock specialists, and for secondary school teachers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
particularly teachers of mathematics and-science subjects. The greatest short-&#13;
ages of middle level manpower were for technicians in all fields, skilled&#13;
artisans and mechanics, bookkeepers, primary school teachers and for a variety&#13;
of specialized vocations in agriculture, industry, business and government.&#13;
While the largest percentages of expatriates were employed in high&#13;
level occupations, the absolute numbers were small. On the other hand, the&#13;
percentage of expatriates in middle level occupations was small, but given the&#13;
very large total employment in this manpower category, their numbers were&#13;
enormous.&#13;
The manpower surveys and plans, which have now been undertaken by&#13;
virtually every country in the region, established the economic justification&#13;
for investments in education sought by economic planners, most of whom were&#13;
expatriates, and by donors.   The methodologies used placed clear priorities on&#13;
secondary and higher education, on science and mathematics and upon the intro-&#13;
duction of vocational training into the general school curriculum. They almost Ih&#13;
completely discounted the value of further investments in primary education&#13;
because, in spite of low enrollment ratios, adequate numbers would be forth-&#13;
coming at this level to provide intakes into secondary education. Moreover,&#13;
it was argued, given the long period of time between an investment in primary&#13;
education and any possible resulting increase in income, such investments were&#13;
"uneconomic" at any reasonable discount rate.   The Bank's lending program for&#13;
education in the 1960's and early 1970's in Africa as elsewhere reflected this&#13;
bias.&#13;
As suggested in the introduction to this paper, few African govern-&#13;
ments regarded the prescriptions of manpower planners as more than guidelines.&#13;
With the exceptions of Tanzania and Botswana, all have regarded their manpower&#13;
plans as a justification for doing what they intended to do in any event;&#13;
expand enrollments in secondary and higher education; manpower studies which&#13;
suggested a curtailment of expansion were ignored. One consequence has been&#13;
tumultuous expansions of enrollments in secondary and higher education far&#13;
in excess of prospects that all graduates will be employed. With the exception&#13;
of Ivory Coast, which has made significant progress in replacing expatriates&#13;
in recent years, and a few countries in Southern Africa, virtually all top&#13;
government posts and most of the top posts in the parastatals and in the private&#13;
sector are now occupied by nationals.&#13;
Most countries in Africa are now troubled with a growing and polit-&#13;
ically volatile group of unemployed secondary school leavers, and several&#13;
countries with prospects that university graduates will soon have difficulties&#13;
finding employment. There are strong pressures for governments to become&#13;
employers of last resort and many, notably Mali, Ghana and the Central African&#13;
Republic have become so with serious consequences for their public financial&#13;
situations. Measures are now required in these countries to reduce public&#13;
payrollsi&#13;
In spite of the rapid expansion of the education system, growing&#13;
numbers of unemployed secondary school leavers and prospects for unemployed&#13;
university graduates, almost all countries still face the anomaly of rather&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
severe high and middle level manpower shortages in the very occupations for&#13;
which shortages existed at independence and, in particular, for managerial&#13;
and technical manpower. The continuing existence of manpower shortages is&#13;
attributable to insufficient attention to formal and on-the-job training as&#13;
opposed to general education, the inadequate numbers of students who receive&#13;
good preparation in science and mathematics in preparation for entry into science-&#13;
based occupations and personnel policies in the public sector which permit and&#13;
even encourage rapid rotation of staff, precluding satisfactory on-the-job train-&#13;
ing through supervision. Because managers responsible for the operation of&#13;
training institutions often fail to maintain sufficient liaison with employers,&#13;
the skill profiles of trainees frequently fail to meet the requirements of the&#13;
jobs which are available. Further, novices entering public service, which&#13;
tends to dominate modern sector employment in most African countries, often&#13;
have very little to do and, therefore, little opportunity to improve their&#13;
skills, because of insufficient operating budgets. Finally, public sector&#13;
salaries often do not provide sufficient incentives for civil servants to make&#13;
special efforts to advance in their careers or, for that matter, to remain&#13;
in the civil service. The resolution of these problems should have the highest&#13;
manpower development priority during the 1980s.&#13;
The training of staff with entirely new occupational profiles for new&#13;
institutions designed to give direct assistance to villagers in a wide variety&#13;
of activities such as health, sanitation, agriculture, nutrition and education&#13;
will be another major task during the 1980s. This work is just beginning in&#13;
countries which have experimented with new institutions with new activities and&#13;
have, consequently, gained a sufficient definition of what the associated job&#13;
profiles are.&#13;

IV. EDUCATION AND TRAINING&#13;
Educational achievements. The educational achievements of the&#13;
population in Africa are the lowest in the world. In 1976, about 85 percent&#13;
of African adults were illiterate.   Only Bangladesh (88%), Nepal (81%) and&#13;
Pakistan (79%) and, in the Middle East, Yemen (87%) have comparably high&#13;
illiteracy rates. All other countries in the world have lower rates. The&#13;
lowest rates of illiteracy in the region are in Tanzania (34%) and Somalia&#13;
(50%) which in the early 1970s assigned adult education a top national&#13;
priority and mounted innovative military style campaigns to train adults.&#13;
Other indicators of educational achievement are enrollment ratios&#13;
for primary, secondary and higher education (Tables 4.1 - 4.3). The ratios&#13;
show that Africa as a whole, nearly two decades after independence, still&#13;
lags substantially behind all other regions at all levels of education. How-&#13;
ever, this does not detract from the region's substantial achievement; overall,&#13;
the region has improved its position relative to other developing areas and&#13;
this is reflected in a comparison of educational growth rates shown in Table&#13;
4.4.&#13;

Middle East&#13;
In a decade and a half, the region has experienced a veritable explo-&#13;
sion in educational enrollments with total enrollments rising from about 14&#13;
million in 1960 to about 39 million in 1976. Enrollment ratios have also risen&#13;
considerably. The percentage of the age group enrolled at the primary level&#13;
throughout Africa rose from about 38 percent in 1960 to about 60 percent in&#13;
1976; at the secondary level from 4 to 14 percent; and in higher education from&#13;
0.6 to 1.8 percent.&#13;
A number of countries now have reasonable expectations of achieving&#13;
universal primary education during the decade 1980-1990. These include Togo,&#13;
Kenya, Botswana, Swaziland, Zambia, Gabon, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. On the&#13;
other hand, in a number of the poorest countries, UPE is not a reasonable&#13;
expectation in this century; these include the Sahelian countries of Mauritania,&#13;
Mali, Niger, Upper Volta and Chad as well as Sierra Leone and Ethiopia. Table&#13;
4.5 shows the structure of enrollments in the formal education system in 1975.&#13;

There have been important changes within the structure of enrollments&#13;
between different types of education. Contrary to what was hoped in the early&#13;
1960s, there has been some decline in the proportion of students enrolled in&#13;
technical and vocational subjects and in increase in the proportion enrolled&#13;
in general education. Also, the objective of increasing the proportions of&#13;
students in secondary and higher education has not been achieved.&#13;
Further progress in improving access to education. In the future,&#13;
progress in expanding enrollments, particularly at the primary school level,&#13;
will be more difficult than in the past because; (a) schools have already been&#13;
established in the most accessible, richest areas. What remains is the least&#13;
accessible, poorest areas where, moreover, enthusiasm for education may be&#13;
lower; (b) most governments in Africa, providing education at all levels which&#13;
is either free or heavily subsidized, have become financially strapped with&#13;
education claiming the largest share of their budgets. Further progress will&#13;
require financial reform of education and a greater sharing of the costs of&#13;
education; (c) other priorities are increasing in importance. For example,&#13;
the rapidly expanding enrollments in the past were usually achieved at a cost&#13;
of declining quality, particularly at the Primary school level where large&#13;
numbers of unqualified school teachers have been used. Upgrading the teaching&#13;
force, the provision of teaching materials and better logistical support for&#13;
schools have become objectives of paramount importance.&#13;
In the poorest of African countries which have both low enrollment&#13;
ratios and financially improvident governments, progress in improving access&#13;
will depend upon success in lowering costs, finding alternative means of&#13;
financing education, increasing student/teacher ratios, and perhaps, devising&#13;
low cost alternatives to primary education. There have been numberous experi-&#13;
ments, many assisted by the Bank. Some countries have attempted to help&#13;
finance schools by adding productive activities (Chad, Benin, Botwana). Others&#13;
have attempted to find alternative forms of basic education by reforming&#13;
Koranic schools (Mauritania) or focussing on adolescents in rural areas (Mali,&#13;
Upper Volta, Benin, Senegal).&#13;

In the 21 low income African countries, women have lower access&#13;
to education than in any other other region except low income Asia. However,&#13;
improvements in income seem to have a significant effect on access for women.&#13;
In the low income African countries about 38 percent of total primary level&#13;
enrollments are women, while in the middle income African countries, about&#13;
45 percent are women. However, during the period 1960-1975, the access of&#13;
women to schooling has improved phenomenally in the low income countries;&#13;
in 1960 only about 28 percent of total primary school enrollments were&#13;
women. The access of women to secondary education in the region, has not&#13;
improved significantly since 1960 and, in a number of countries, it may have&#13;
declined.&#13;
Efficiency. The quality of education is sometimes measured, rather&#13;
crudely, by data or dropout and repetition rates, and percent of teachers who&#13;
are unqualified. In Africa, on the average, because of repetition and drop-&#13;
outs, it requires 10 pupil years to produce 1 primary school graduate in a&#13;
6-year course. Experience at the university level varies widely. In Nigeria&#13;
and Kenya, for example, repetition and drop-out rates are low, while in&#13;
Ivory Coast, they are phenomenally high; in some courses at the University&#13;
of Abidjan, it requires over 10 student years to produce a graduate of a&#13;
three year course. Much of the problem of repetition in primary schools in&#13;
Africa is attributable to high repetition in the last year of school. Given&#13;
limited entry into secondary schools, students in almost every country very&#13;
often elect to repeat the last year to improve their chances on secondary&#13;
school entry examinations.&#13;
Teacher quality varies widely in the region and between areas within&#13;
countries. The majority of countries have more than 50 percent of their primary&#13;
school teachers unqualified. The situation is significantly better in secondary&#13;
schools where there is a heavy reliance on expatriates; in fact, it is not&#13;
uncommon to find that a majority of teachers at this level are expatriates.&#13;
The heavy use of expatriate secondary school teachers very largely accounts&#13;
for the fact that the region absorbs 75 percent of all technical assistance&#13;
available worldwide.&#13;
The external efficiency of African school systems largely refers to&#13;
their ability to satisfy manpower requirements and to the ability of school&#13;
leavers to find jobs. The manpower situation has been discussed in Section II,&#13;
above. It has also been noted that the problem of unemployed school leavers&#13;
has assumed serious proportions in some countries and that at least three&#13;
Governments (Mali, Ghana and CAR) have become employers of last resort.&#13;
Ronald Dore in a study conducted several years ago, demonstrated the&#13;
magnitude of the problem by comparing projected modern sector employment growth&#13;
with the projected supply of school leavers. The results of his study are&#13;
shown in Table 4.6.&#13;

Note: New job creation refers to the net increase in formal sector employ-&#13;
ment on the assumption of a 2 or 5 percent per annum increase in such employment.&#13;
Even under optimistic assumptions with respect to both employment (high) and&#13;
enrollment growth (low), the job situation for school leavers is poor and&#13;
deteriorating.&#13;
A major result of growing school leaver unemployment is an escalation&#13;
of minimum entry requirements for jobs and, as a consequence, an increased&#13;
demand for additional years of schooling. The ILO World Employment Program's&#13;
study of employment in Kenya discusses this unresolved problem in some depth.&#13;
However, the study underscores that the problems of open unemployment espe-&#13;
cially among school leavers is no-where near as important as the underemployment&#13;
and poverty in the country; unemployed school leavers are a small, but politi-&#13;
cally troublesome group.&#13;
Finance. Improving access to education and its quality in Africa has&#13;
become severely constrained by the current high costs of operating the existing&#13;
educational systems. Of the 34 countries in the region for which the Bank&#13;
maintains comparative educational data; 19 committed a larger percentage of&#13;
their GDP to education than the median of all countries (3.9 percent). Benin,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
Botswana, Congo, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesalke, Senegal, Zaire and Zambia fall&#13;
in the- first quartile (5.1 percent) of all countries, spending more than 5&#13;
percent of GDP on education; Lesothe spends a phenomenal 12 percent. With&#13;
the excention of 5 of the 34 countries (for which data are available) in the&#13;
region, all devote a larger percentage of their national budget to education,&#13;
than all other developing countries; world-wide, this is about 16 percent.&#13;
Only Chad (10%), Ethiopia (12.5%), Gambia (11.5%), Liberia (13.2%), Malawi&#13;
(9.3%) and Somalia (12%) spent less. Benin, Mali, Ivory Coast and Nigeria&#13;
commit more than 30 percent of their governments' budgets to education;&#13;
current plans should escalate this percentage to closer to 40 percent in&#13;
Nigeria and Ivory Coast.&#13;
Unit costs in Africa, as a percent of GDP per capita are, by far,&#13;
the highest in the world, as shown in Table 4.7.&#13;

Unit Costs as a Percent of GDP Per Capita in Africa has clearly becom'e&#13;
far more burdensome on individuals, national economies and on governments than&#13;
in other regions.&#13;
The unit costs of education are high not only relative to GDP per&#13;
capita, but in absolute terms. In terms of capital and recurrent costs per&#13;
student, African governments spend at levels normally associated with countries&#13;
which have per capita incomes which are at least 3 and as much as 8 times higher.&#13;
The reasons for these high costs are several: (a) the use of educational techno-&#13;
logies which tend to be relatively fixed, requiring the use of comparable inputs&#13;
at all levels of income; (b) high teacher's salaries which comprise up to 90 per-&#13;
cent of the recurrent costs of education; (c) high capital costs which are a&#13;
consequence of attempts to maintain European standards of buildings and equipment;&#13;
(d) the prevelance of poorly developed and inefficient construction industry; (a)&#13;
high transportation costs; (f) the use of boarding facilities at levels of educ-&#13;
ation above primary school. The attempt to meet these standards results in the&#13;
high cost importation of building materials and equipment. Attempts to reduce&#13;
costs will require a concerted effort in all of these areas, and, in particular,&#13;
on the costs of teachers per student. Problems of financing education in Africa&#13;
threaten to become much worse before the end of the century because, unlike the&#13;
rest of the world, population growth rates in the region continue to increase.&#13;
Simply to retain the low enrollment ratios of 1980, most countries will have to&#13;
more than double total enrollments by the end of the century.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Administration and Management. Like the public service in general,&#13;
the management of Africa's school systems is weak.   Essential data for decision-&#13;
making are often years out of date, if not totally lacking; ministries are not&#13;
properly staffed and lack operating funds, and; both morale and discipline are&#13;
typically poor. Weak from the outset, education administrations have been able&#13;
to cope with the tumultuous development, and later management, of very large&#13;
school systems. Bank project experience in the region shows that education&#13;
ministries have great difficulties preparing and later, implementing, projects.&#13;
Improvement will involve not only more training for staff in all occupations,&#13;
especially managers, but reform in general government personnel policies,&#13;
reorganization, and a better funding of operations.&#13;

V. HEALTH AND POPULATION&#13;
Like other indicators of human resource development, data on health&#13;
show that Africans have the poorest health in the world. What is more, they&#13;
appear to be losing ground relative to the populations of other regions in&#13;
terms of rates of improvement. This is reflected in existing crude death&#13;
rates and their rates of decline since 1950/55.&#13;

In terms of life expectancy at birth, infant mortality per 1000 live births&#13;
and child mortality, these indicators show that Africans are substantially&#13;
worse off than the people in the less-developed countries of any other&#13;
region.&#13;
These measures are, of course, averages. The data for the countries&#13;
in the Sahel reflect health conditions which are substantially worse. In&#13;
Mali, for example, the crude death rate is about 30 per 1000, life expectancy&#13;
is 37 years and the infant mortality rate is about 188 per 1,000 live births.&#13;
The principal cause of death in Africa is malaria to which children&#13;
under 5 years are particularly vulnerable. Without medication programs, as&#13;
many as 80 percent of the children in an area can be infected. However, with&#13;
public medication programs, this incidence has been reduced to 10 percent and&#13;
less.&#13;
Intestinal diseases, while especially common, are often not reported.&#13;
Where water supplies and sanitation are not secure, most of the population&#13;
can be infected. Intestinal diseases account for about 30 percent of all&#13;
deaths, with amebic and vacillary dysentary the major causes of loss of time&#13;
from work among adults. Control of dysentary and intestinal parasites will&#13;
depend upon changing the behavioral patterns affecting sanitation.&#13;
Measles, tragically, is the main killer of small children; it is&#13;
tragic because it is easily prevented, the main constraint being technical,&#13;
the maintenance of an appropriate temperature range for the vaccine. Mortali-&#13;
ty from measles can also significantly be reduced with better child nutrition.&#13;
Tetanus is highly prevalent and is a particularly acute problem&#13;
for women and children at childbirth. Tuberculosis is a major threat to&#13;
health, although it has probably received more attention than other diseases.&#13;
Locally, guinea worm, polioniyelitis, meningitis, shistosomaisis and trypano-&#13;
somiasis can be extremely serious threats to health. Onchocerciosis, primarily&#13;
prevalent in a small area in West Africa, provides that area, agriculturally&#13;
one of Africa's most fertile- with the highest incidence of blindness in the&#13;
world.&#13;
Morbidity and mortality attributable to infectious diseases and&#13;
nutritional status are closely linked. The undernourishment of large segments&#13;
of the African population, mostly in rural areas, reduces their resistance&#13;
to disease and serves to increase morbidity and mortality rates.&#13;
African health services. Generally, the region's governments have&#13;
not given the same attention to health as they have to education. In 22&#13;
countries for which data are available, government expenditures as a percent&#13;
of the total budget averaged only 5.5 percent. In 1975, Malawi committed&#13;
the largest portion of its budget to health and Gabon, only 1.6 percent (which&#13;
still provided Gabon's'population with the largest per capita expenditure).&#13;
Table 5.3 shows the range of expenditures on health in selected countries.&#13;
In examining these data, it should be noted that Western European countries&#13;
and the U.S. allocate very nearly $1,700 per capita to health. The average&#13;
for Africa of both public and private expenditures is almost certainly some-&#13;
what less than US$10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
This level of per capita expenditures will not support the same&#13;
type of health services as are prevalent in the developed countries of&#13;
Europe and North America; nor would these services be appropriate even&#13;
if they could be afforded. In Europe, health programs are based on treat-&#13;
ment by physicians of biological disorders and health policy is overwhelmingly&#13;
directed toward the establishment of curative facilities, the training of&#13;
personnel to man them and toward biological research. The European system&#13;
reflects the historical amelioration, through development, of the environmental&#13;
cultural, economic and demographic causes of ill health. The system has now&#13;
become highly specialized for the cure of exceptional illnesses and the&#13;
prevention of diseases mostly attributable to affluence, industrial pollution&#13;
and old age. Unfortunately, most African countries have European type systems&#13;
where, often, hospitals and their staff, located primarily in the large towns,&#13;
absorb almost all of the governments' health budgets. In 1975, a single&#13;
hospital in Liberia absorbed more than 50 percent of the government's health&#13;
budget. These services are largely curative and do not reach very many&#13;
people.&#13;
It is not always true that the current African system of health&#13;
care was imposed by the former colonial governments; some simply developed&#13;
along European lines after independence. Among African colonial powers,&#13;
the French, with the Germans and the Belgians, long ago recognized that&#13;
European medicine could not be transplanted into Africa and, as early as&#13;
1917, cooperated in the establishment of an international program which&#13;
they believed to be better adapted, first against trypanosomiasis. Between&#13;
1917 and the gaining of independence by African countries in the early&#13;
1960s, this program developed through successive reorganizations to include&#13;
vaccination against other diseases, treatment and health education. The&#13;
system, which is still in existence in some countries under the name of&#13;
l'Organisation de Cooperation et de Coordination pour la Lutte contre les&#13;
Grandes Endemies, was characterized by its low cost, its strong orientation&#13;
toward preventive medicine, mobile as opposed to fixed base services and&#13;
autonomy vis-a-vis the colonial administration. During the colonial period,&#13;
curative services developed independently of the Grandes Endemies; however,&#13;
the curative services experienced their greatest growth after independence&#13;
while the Lutte contre les Grandes Endemies suffered a decline. In short,&#13;
the French, German and Belgian colonial powers did not impose a completely&#13;
inappropriate public health system in their colonies; the growing dominance&#13;
of fixed base curative services is a consequence of unbalanced development&#13;
since independence.&#13;
The major constraints on the establishment of a village based&#13;
health service in Africa are the scarcity of high and middle level manpower,&#13;
finance and, decreasingly, the strong orientation of senior health officials&#13;
in many countries toward western-type medicine. Further, it is usually&#13;
difficult to provide sufficient incentives for health staff, particularly&#13;
physicians, to work under rural conditions which are often harsh.&#13;
The high level manpower required in an African health system would&#13;
largely consist of physicians who, in a village-based system, would perform&#13;
supervisory training and diagnostic roles. Many of the physicians now&#13;
practising would require retraining to perform these roles. Actual treatment&#13;
and village level extension services would be the responsibilities of subor-&#13;
dinate paramedicals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
The data for Africa underscores the need to relieve physicians of&#13;
many of their traditional curative activities to enable their knowledge to&#13;
be applied more extensively. Table 5.4 shows the ratios of population to&#13;
physicians for the period 1960-1975. With few exceptions, these are by far&#13;
the highest ratios in the world. The time series reflect first the growth&#13;
in population and second, in many countries, the employment of the first&#13;
graduates from medical schools established after independence. Thus, in&#13;
many countries, the ratios increased until 1970, and thereafter declined.&#13;
Some countries -- Benin, Tanzania, Cuinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Uganda, Angola,&#13;
Botswana, Congo, Somalia and Swaziland currently have higher ratios than&#13;
in 1960, although the Kenya ratio is now beginning to decline because of&#13;
increases in medical school graduates. Overall, since independence the&#13;
region has not made much progress in satisfying the need for physicians and&#13;
medical schools with appropriate curricula deserve very high priority in&#13;
the investment programs, of most African countries.&#13;
Institution building for village-based rural health services. There&#13;
has now been a considerable amount of experimentation with village based&#13;
services in Africa, most notably in Mali where WHO and USAID have established&#13;
pilot schemes, in Northern Nigeria where Ahmadu Bello University has provided&#13;
leadership, in Kenya, and in Tanzania. The lessons learned from these&#13;
experiments are:&#13;
(a) While the main focus of attention for village-based health care&#13;
should be preventive, it should not be divorced from the curative&#13;
services.&#13;
(b)  Good communications and strong logistical support is required for&#13;
rural services which are essentially educationally oriented.&#13;
(c) Priority should be given to instructing women of child bearing age&#13;
on child care, nutrition and family planning.&#13;
(d) The instruction of all villagers and investments in sanitation are&#13;
crucial to good health.&#13;
(e) A major purpose of providing cleaner water to villagers is to&#13;
relieve women of the need to carry it, sometimes for great distances.&#13;
Similarly, better child care and nutrition depends upon relieving&#13;
women of some of their burdens in carrying wood and milling grain.&#13;
(f) Attention must be given to changes in the division of labor and the&#13;
welfare of individual family members which might result from new&#13;
cash cropping schemes. These schemes can diminish the welfare of&#13;
women and children.&#13;
(g) Improved health in Africa will be best achieved through a variety&#13;
of policy interventions, most of which do not involve ministries&#13;
of health. Because of the complementarities of these interventions,&#13;
a close coordination among government services is required. Chart&#13;
I outlines the interrelationships of these interventions.&#13;

VI.   THE ROLE OF THE BANK IN HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Summary of Prior Activities in Africa.    The Bank's assistance to African&#13;
countries in the area of human resources has been predominantly to further the&#13;
development of the formal education system. Until the mid-1970s priority was&#13;
given to activities which would ameliorate scarcities of high and middle level&#13;
manpower, i.e. to secondary education, technical and vocational training and&#13;
primary and secondary teacher training. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the Bank&#13;
began to give serious consideration to primary and nonformal education and&#13;
established several innovative pilot projects in Ethiopia, Mali, Upper Volta,&#13;
Benin, Senegal and Chad. While firm conclusions cannot yet be drawn from&#13;
these projects which would serve as a basis for their replication elsewhere,&#13;
initial evidence suggests that projects of this type are difficult to implement&#13;
and more expensive and less effective than was anticipated.&#13;
Also, beginning in the mid-1970s, the Bank began to consider a role&#13;
for project related training, primarily as a consequence of experience which&#13;
showed that projects in railways, roads, ports, electric power and agriculture&#13;
required associated manpower training if they were to be fully effective.&#13;
Lending for project related training has since become sizeable. Experience has&#13;
shown that project related training can be a very efficient way of relieving&#13;
manpower shortages because curricula are designed to meet specific employer&#13;
needs, training is financed by employers and is regarded as part of overall&#13;
staff development programs. Most importantly, there is virtually no danger of&#13;
a wasteful overproduction of skilled workers.&#13;
While the Bank conducted a health sector survey in Mali in 1978 in&#13;
anticipation of a free standing health project, investments in health services&#13;
have taken place only as minor components of agricultural projects and as&#13;
formal training components of education projects. The exception is the Bank's&#13;
participation with a consortium of donors in an onchosclerosis program in West&#13;
Africa. The functional literacy program in Mali is also an exception; this&#13;
education project trains adolescents to become functionally literate as village&#13;
health workers and is an important experiment in the type of paramedical&#13;
training required in the region. Little effort has been made in projects to&#13;
reach women with the kinds of information and assistance they require for&#13;
improved maternal health, child care, family planning or nutrition. No effort&#13;
has been made in Bank projects to reduce the work load of women (except in&#13;
provision of water) or to assist them with improving their traditional acti-&#13;
vities in poultry raising, cultivation of non-staple components in their diets&#13;
or in marketing.&#13;
Historically, efforts to improve public administration have generally&#13;
been confined to fellowships in projects for training government staff; little&#13;
attempt has been made to evaluate their effectiveness in achieving project&#13;
objectives. More recently, concerted efforts have been made in some projects&#13;
and in some sectors to improving administration in selected ministries and&#13;
parastatals. For example, the second education project in Liberia provided for&#13;
a systematic reorganization of the Ministry of Education and for the training&#13;
of Ministry staff. In Senegal, in two projects, one of which is a technical&#13;
assistance project, efforts are being made to improve administration and&#13;
management of both government ministries and of parastatals. Throughout the&#13;
region attention is increasingly being given in railway, highway, ports,&#13;
electricity, water and agricultural projects to improving the management of&#13;
parastatals, or the government ministry which is responsible for the activity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
being assisted. However, these efforts have not been completely successful&#13;
because, generally, too little attention was given to their preparation as&#13;
relatively small components of large projects.&#13;
A sector approach to the improvement of management and public&#13;
administration in agriculture has been initiated in West Africa, beginning&#13;
with a regional study of agricultural management and administration and the&#13;
establishment, in Nigeria, of an agricultural Management Training School&#13;
assisted by a Bank project. Although results will not be available for several&#13;
years, these efforts are novel and appear to be in the right direction.&#13;
Future Strateay. A human resource strategy for the Bank in Africa&#13;
has thus been slowly evolving. The essential features of the emerging strategy&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)  The strengthening of public administration and management&#13;
through training and reorganization to make government and&#13;
parastatals more effective in preparing and 'implementing&#13;
their development programs.&#13;
(b) Increased attention to the development of village or local&#13;
area based institutions for basic education, health,&#13;
agricultural improvement, water supplies and sanitation.&#13;
(c) Training the manpower required to operate and manage&#13;
village based institutions.&#13;
(d) Increased attention to primary education, primary teacher&#13;
training, technical education and science and mathematics&#13;
at all levels.&#13;
(e) Increased attention to the implications of recurrent costs&#13;
in project identification and for project design.&#13;
While the emergence of this strategy appears immutable, it is not one&#13;
to which the Bank is accustomed, nor will it be easily implementable. First,&#13;
projects are likely to be generally smaller in the amount of total lending&#13;
involved. Second, projects will require a type of expertise which the Bank&#13;
does not have, particularly in public administration, management and health.&#13;
Third, projects will require a level of cooperation not only between government&#13;
ministries, but also between Bank project divisions to which both are un-&#13;
accustomed. In Africa, at least, programs divisions of the Bank will acquire&#13;
new responsibilities for project coordination. Fourth, project supervision&#13;
will be difficult because it will be intensive and, moreover, may require the&#13;
participation of two or more project divisions which would create new&#13;
management problems. Fifth, the political sensitivity of projects will increase&#13;
and hence, the Bank's exposure.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
The development of South Asia is unquestionably a problem of effec-&#13;
tive human resource utilization.' Of the mid-1977 population of almost 1.3&#13;
billion persons in low-income countries (those having per-capita GDP's less&#13;
than $300) two out of every three lived in South Asia. Indeed three-quarters&#13;
of these lived in India alone. Furthermore the population of South Asia&#13;
represents the world's largest concentration of the poor. Average per-capita&#13;
income in the region reached only $147 in 1977 and an estimated range of 450-&#13;
500 million peo le lived in households characterized by per-capita income&#13;
levels less than 70 in current prices. While recognizing that effective&#13;
human resource utilization is primarily a matter of improving productivity&#13;
and income generation, governments in South Asia have also focussed on directly&#13;
improving the nutritional, health and educational status of the poor who are&#13;
severely disadvantaged in each of these areas. Such efforts are intended both&#13;
to raise living standards and to develop greater earning capacity. This paper&#13;
addresses two broad dimensions of that challenge: (i) the scope and charac-&#13;
teristics of the human resource condition in South Asia and (ii) special&#13;
policies and programs for human resource development that have been adopted&#13;
or proposed in various countries of the region.&#13;
Prior to the detailed analysis, an important consideration is the&#13;
economic environment in which human resource development is pursued. Not only&#13;
are absolute levels of per-capita income low in South Asia but growth perform-&#13;
ance has also been disappointing with a regional average growth rate of 1.2%&#13;
per annum between 1960 and 1977 in per-capita income. While the relationship&#13;
between human resource development and economic growth is not a topic that can&#13;
be adequately or even appropriately discussed in the context of this paper,&#13;
South Asian experience does point-up important aspects of the relationship.&#13;
Human resource development encompasses elements of both consumpt,ion and&#13;
investment. High levels of consumption of education and health services&#13;
are generally associated with quite high income levels, both cross-sectionally&#13;
across individuals within countries and across country aggregates. 1/ To the&#13;
extent that consumption of education and health services are desired outcomes&#13;
of the economic growth process and that South Asian countries will be several&#13;
decades in reaching per-capita income levels associated with the average&#13;
levels of educational attainment and health status attained by middle-income&#13;
countries, there is a strong case for direct welfare-improving investment in&#13;
human resources. Experience in Sri Lanka and Kerala suggests that the attain-&#13;
ment of high levels of welfare as measured by the consumption of education and&#13;
1/   For example in 1975 the South Asia region had an adult literacy,rate of&#13;
35% and a life expectancy at birth of 50 years (both comparable to the&#13;
averages for all low income countries) while middle-income countries&#13;
averaged 69% and 60 years respectively at an average income level almost&#13;
8 times that of South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
health services is not contingent on the prior attainment of high income&#13;
levels. 1/&#13;
It must also be stressed that effective human resource utilization&#13;
is an important concomitant of any human development strategy. Effective&#13;
utilization ties the consumption of education and health services to higher&#13;
levels of productivity in either the formal or non-formal sectors. These&#13;
conditions can only occur in an economy with relatively rapidly expanding&#13;
economic opportunities. Here the record of South Asian countries is uniformly&#13;
discouraging. Not only is open unemployment a serious problem with estimated&#13;
rates ranging from 30% in Bangladesh, 20% in Sri Lanka to somewhat less than&#13;
10% in India, but low productivity is evidenced by the large number of full-&#13;
time participants in the labor force earning substantially less than the&#13;
minimum subsistence level of income. Human resource development in South Asia&#13;
must therefore be complementary with more rapid economic growth even if it is&#13;
viewed as a direct welfare-improving activity. 2/&#13;
This association with growth oriented policies and the very limited&#13;
resources for growth in South Asia require that human resource development be&#13;
undertaken in the most cost-effective manner possible and that programs be&#13;
targetted as accurately as possible. In the face of these constraints govern-&#13;
ments in South Asia have responded with innovative approaches in some sectors&#13;
while retaining over-ambitious objectives matched by underfunded, understaffed&#13;
programs in other sectors. A major focus of this analysis, therefore, will be&#13;
to supplement the description of the environment for human resource development&#13;
in South Asia with a review of important education, nutrition and health&#13;
programs (either planned or actually in implementation) and policies. In this&#13;
context the examples of Kerala and Sri Lanka may again be cited in support of&#13;
the potential compatibility of growth and human resource development. Both&#13;
experienced rates of per-capita income growth above the average for the&#13;
1/   In terms of the basic indicators cited in footnote 1 Sri Lanka had an&#13;
adult literacy rate of 78% in 1975 and a life expectancy at birth of 69&#13;
years, both considerably above the average for middle-income countries.&#13;
2/   Of course, there are many reasons to advocate investment in human&#13;
resources as itself an important determinant of the growth process&#13;
contributing directly to the alleviation of poverty: these will&#13;
receive more detailed treatment below.&#13;
&#13;

region as a whole during the past two decades. 1/ The consideration of&#13;
current programs and policies should indicate prospects for replicating this&#13;
experience not only in the remainder of South Asia but in other low-income&#13;
countries as well.&#13;
The remainder of this paper will be divided into four parts: the&#13;
first will describe the basic demographic and human resource environment of&#13;
the region. The second will deal with economy-wide or "macro" issues of&#13;
human resource development in South Asia while the third part will focus on&#13;
"micro" issues affecting the internal efficiency of human resource develop-&#13;
ment programs. The final section will, return to the issues raised in this&#13;
introduction concerning the role that human resource development can play&#13;
in South Asia.&#13;
The Environment for Human Resource Development in South Asia&#13;
The structural characteristics of the population play an important&#13;
role in determining the stock of potential human resources and the composition&#13;
of demand for services in health and education. Demographic aggregates are of&#13;
daunting magnitude in South Asia. By mid-1980 an estimated 896 million people&#13;
will live in the sub-continent from Pakistan to Burma. As indicated in Table&#13;
1 almost 75% of this total live in India with another 19% in Bangladesh and&#13;
Pakistan.&#13;
1/   Sri Lanka's growth rate between 1960 and 1977 averaged 2.0% per annum&#13;
and Kerala's 1.4% compared to 1.2% for the region. Growth performance&#13;
in Sri Lanka has however declined considerably during the 1970s from&#13;
over 3.0% per-capita in the late 1960s to approximately 1.0% between&#13;
1970 and 1976. While Sri Lanka's commitment to an extensive program&#13;
of health, education, and other services may have inhibited a more&#13;
timely adjustment to the international environment of the 1970s, it is&#13;
probable that that adjustment could have been made without significant&#13;
setback to Sri Lanka's human resource development objectives. Kerala, of&#13;
course, operates within the framework of the sluggish Indian economy so&#13;
that international comparisons are not strictly appropriate. However,&#13;
Kerala does rank 5th among Indian states in per capita income growth over&#13;
this period. Kerala's growth may also be understated in ways which relate&#13;
directly to the role of human resource development as Kerala has&#13;
served as a source of educated manpower, particularly in the health&#13;
sector, throughout India and more recently in the Persian Gulf area.&#13;
Remittances to the state have played an important role in raising&#13;
welfare levels but have not been captured in conventional state GDP&#13;
accounting.&#13;

*    Alternative projections based on moderately more successful&#13;
family planning activities reducing growth rates by only 0.1&#13;
percentage point. The major impact is made in India which must&#13;
implement more effective population activities from an already&#13;
reduced growth rate. Nevertheless India is expected to make&#13;
relatively greater progress.&#13;
The impact of this growth on the demand for education and health services&#13;
is the equivalent of adding to the region another India populated exclusively&#13;
by individuals from preschool and school age through those forming new&#13;
families, the very ages for which the potential demand for maternal and child&#13;
health services is greatest. These projections represent little decline in&#13;
the population growth rates achieved during the 1970s. Moderately greater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

success in family planning efforts (yielding an average reduction in growth&#13;
rates of 0.1 percentage point) could make a difference to the region of almost&#13;
40 million individuals (see starred column in Table 2).&#13;
While precise effects of population growth on the age structure of&#13;
the population will depend on the relative contribution of fertility and&#13;
mortality trends, some likely trends in the demand for education and health&#13;
services can be indicated. Over the next twenty years, declining population&#13;
growth rates are likely to have the greatest impact on the demand for primary&#13;
education services as successive primary school age cohorts stabilize or&#13;
actually decline in size. In contrast most women of child-bearing age over&#13;
the next twenty years have already been born. This, in combination with the&#13;
relatively young age structure of South Asia's population, means that the&#13;
demand for basic health services, most importantly maternal and child health,&#13;
will increase considerably faster than total population growth between 1980&#13;
and 2000. Illustrative calculations are indicated for the three major&#13;
countries of the region in Table 3. 1/&#13;
1/   The parameters of these estimates are the same for the smaller countries.&#13;
Reasonably rapid decline in the population growth rate will have a&#13;
stabilizing effect on the primary school age within a very few years;&#13;
however, past rapid rates of growth associated with a young age distri-&#13;
bution (see Table 1) will inevitably result in rapid growth of the cohort&#13;
of women of childbearing age. Of the smaller countries, Nepal is clearly&#13;
most vulnerable on both counts with only a slight projected decline in&#13;
population growth rates and an exceptionally young current age-distribution.&#13;
Nepal will have to face rapidly expanding demand for both education and&#13;
health services just on the basis of demographic trends alone. Sri Lanka&#13;
is best placed at the opposite end of the spectrum, with little demographic&#13;
pressure on either count. Burma follows, broadly, the demographic pattern&#13;
of the larger countries, with considerably more demographic pressure in&#13;
health than in education.&#13;

Note:  Figures in the various sources are not necessarily comparable to WDR&#13;
population projections, in terms of time span, age-groups, and more&#13;
important, underlying fertility and mortality assumptions. Adjustments&#13;
have been made to facilitate comparison but the estimates remain only&#13;
illustrative.&#13;
To the extent that such projections are at all useful they illustrate&#13;
significant differences among countries in the relative burdens of responding&#13;
to future demands for human resource investment. The likely demands on India's&#13;
primary education system are large in magnitude (19 million additional places&#13;
by 2000) but represent an increment of little more than 20% over existing&#13;
"demand". In the case of Bangladesh this increment amounts to almost 40% and&#13;
for Pakistan, over 60%. Similar disparities exist in the anticipated demand&#13;
for the expansion of maternal and child health facilities, with India having&#13;
to keep only a little ahead of overall population growth while Bangladesh and&#13;
Pakistan, in particular, will face quite rapidly expanding demand. 1/&#13;
Another dimension of population structure in South Asia with&#13;
important implications for human resource development concerns the low sex&#13;
ratios in several countries. These are reported in Table 1 and indicate&#13;
considerable variation across the Region. While the sex ratio (here taken&#13;
to be the ratio of females to males) at birth is approximately .93, a dif-&#13;
ferential pattern of mortality in most countries results in sex-ratios rapidly&#13;
approaching or indeed exceeding parity. In South Asia the opposite results:&#13;
7 days after birth the sex ratio of mortality has been estimated to approach&#13;
1/   The rapid growth in the number of women of childbearing age in Pakistan&#13;
is due primarily to this category being particularly depressed in the&#13;
current sex-age structure of the population (the female/male ratio&#13;
ages 15-49 was .889 in the adjusted 1972 population estimates.&#13;
With relatively high population growth rates in the 1970s and early&#13;
1980s and projected improvements in mortality throughout the period,&#13;
a "bulge" in the age-structure results by 2000, with obvious feedback&#13;
on the growth of school-age population.&#13;

Moreover this situation appears to culminate a marked decline in the relative&#13;
survival rates of women in South Asia which apparently commenced as early as&#13;
1900.&#13;

Although these data are unadjusted for migration, they are consistent&#13;
with mortality evidence cited above and imply very little improvement, if not&#13;
actually deterioration, in the circumstances of women in South Asia. The&#13;
orientation of government services and programs that contributes to this&#13;
situation will be addressed below, but this aspect of the demographic environ-&#13;
ment illustrates the entrenched biases against women in the South Asia environ-&#13;
ment. Inadequate attention to the health needs of girls and women will result&#13;
in persistently'high rates of infant mortality; furthermore, low social value&#13;
will continue to be attached to the education of women as their ultimate earn-&#13;
ing capacity and economic contribution continues to be undermined by repeated&#13;
pregnancies and greater likelihood of early death. Statewise evidence from&#13;
India and the comparison with Sri Lanka'support the general importance accorded&#13;
the sex ratio in relation to general human resource development. 2/&#13;
1/   Evidence on these points is brought together by Asok Mitra, Implications&#13;
of the Declining Sex Ratio in India's Population, New Delhi 1979.&#13;
2/   In this regard a caveat concerning Nepal should be mentioned, in that&#13;
Nepal while having low indicators of human resource development, has&#13;
the highest sex ratio. This may reflect general equality in the distri-&#13;
bution of the very inadequate level of health services.&#13;
&#13;

Research conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research reveals&#13;
that 70% of pregnant women in India suffer from anaemia which has proved&#13;
resistant to extremely high dosages of iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12.&#13;
Chronic malnutrition, poor drinking water and lack of adequate sanitation&#13;
are blamed for the resilience of anaemia. This condition contributes to&#13;
India's extremely high rates of maternal mortality estimated to be 573&#13;
per 100,000 livebirths in 1968 compared to an extimate for Sri Lanka of&#13;
300 in 1962. Women also suffer differentially higher mortality from the&#13;
major illnesses related to generally low health standards such as gastro-&#13;
enteritis, bronchiopneumonia, avitaminosis and other dietary deficiencies.&#13;
A final structural aspect of the demographic environment in South&#13;
Asia is spatial distribution including the rural-urban split. Four out of&#13;
five residents in South Asia live in rural areas, ranging from a low of 75%&#13;
in Pakistan to 91% in Bangladesh and 96% in Nepal. With this overwhelmingly&#13;
rural disposition of the population it is nevertheless still true that human&#13;
resource development has proceeded with a pronounced urban bias. In India&#13;
for example literacy rates in 1971 were 120% higher in urban areas than rural;&#13;
in Bangladesh, 100% higher in 1974. The differential was even greater with&#13;
regard to female literacy: 220% higher in urban versus rural India and&#13;
150% in Bangladesh.&#13;
Similar differentials exist in the case of health outcomes. For&#13;
example, infant mortality rates are only about 70% as high in urban areas of&#13;
India and Pakistan as in the rural areas. In the provision of health services&#13;
the disparities are even greater with roughly 8 times as many hospital beds&#13;
in urban areas as in rural areas. Numerous studies document the inverse&#13;
correlation between remoteness and adequate staffing of even existing facili-&#13;
ties.     There are special problems of remoteness and accessibility in almost&#13;
all South Asian countries. In India, the tribal population which is concen-&#13;
trated in remote areas, constitutes nearly 7% of the population or over 46&#13;
million people. While conditions vary regionally these groups suffer special&#13;
disadvantages due to lack of access to both education and health services.&#13;
Many tribals lack even the necessary economic base to provide food for more&#13;
than 200-250 days throughout the year. An analogous situation obtains in&#13;
Nepal where over 60% of the population lives in the hill regions where there&#13;
are very difficult problems of access. In Pakistan, Bangladesh and India an&#13;
inadequate network of roads is a major obstacle to the delivery of services,&#13;
particularly in the monsoon season. In India, for example, it is estimated&#13;
that almost 10% of the half-million villages are without road connection to&#13;
the outside world. Such isolation severely limits appropriate delivery&#13;
systems for human resource development.&#13;
Equally severe problems of accessibility can exist within a village,&#13;
as large numbers of individuals nominally served by existing institutions are&#13;
traditionally denied access to economic and government resources. Scheduled&#13;
castes in India amount to almost 15% of the total population (100 million&#13;
individuals). Although various policies have long been instituted to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -&#13;
provide greater access to government services for these groups, little pro-&#13;
gress has been made except in male primary school enrollment (and even then&#13;
dropout rates remain much higher than average). While there have been some&#13;
successes in involving these groups in the "development process" (notably,&#13;
projects under the sponsorship of the National Dairy Development Board),&#13;
their lower educational and health status is not likely to be significantly&#13;
improved without explicit attention to the problems of penetrating the rigid&#13;
stratification of village society. 1/&#13;
Current Status of Human Resource Development. Some of the obstacles&#13;
constraining the more rapid development of human resources in South Asia have&#13;
been broached already in the discussion of demographic characteristics. This&#13;
section will survey in greater detail the actual status of human resource&#13;
development. But first one should draw attention to an important factor in&#13;
South Asia which is the general interdependence of poverty, inadequate nutri-&#13;
tion, poor health, and low educational attainments. Both cross-national and&#13;
intra-country studies have demonstrated significant linkages between parental&#13;
education and child health in developing countries. A recent review of these&#13;
studies has concluded that, on average, an additional year of schooling for&#13;
the mother is associated with a reduction of 9-10 per 1,000 in child mortality.&#13;
Mothers of malnourished children were also found to have significantly higher&#13;
probabilities of being illiterate. 2/ The common thread running through all&#13;
these elements is the low social and economic status of women.    In South Asia&#13;
this is apparent through differential attainments in both education and&#13;
health, but even more important, in the interaction between female literacy&#13;
and health status. A recent case study of health improvement in Kerala&#13;
concludes that the "high level of literacy and education among females in&#13;
1/   Although the particular problems of caste stratification are most severe&#13;
in India, there is also evidence that class divisions are also quite&#13;
strong in both Pakistan and Bangladesh, see, for example, Cain, Khanam,&#13;
Nahar, Class, Patriarchy, and the Structure of Women's Work in Rural&#13;
Bangladesh, Population Council, New York 1979. In Sri Lanka, although&#13;
general accessibility is quite high, there are significant problems in&#13;
reaching groups such as estate laborers who slip through Sri Lanka's&#13;
generally finer net of social services. The minority status of these&#13;
individuals in the population is undoubtedly a contributory factor.&#13;
2/   These studies have been reviewed in S.H. Cochrane and ofhers, "The Effects&#13;
of Education on Health," World Bank Staff Working Paper, no. 405 (Washington,&#13;
D.C., July 1980). The linkages have been explored in the case of Sri Lanka in&#13;
P. Isenman, The Relationship of Basic Needs to Growth:    the Case of Sri&#13;
Lanka. Some indirect evidence on the education - nutrition - health&#13;
status linkage is also provided in the analysis of the nutrition com-&#13;
ponent of the Narangwal experiment (Taylor, et. al. Malnutrition,&#13;
Infection, Growth and Development: The Narangwal Expe ience    which&#13;
documented that mid-caste families, with occupations requiring some&#13;
numeracy and literacy (shopkeepers, civil servants) had children with&#13;
weight grains comparable to those of landowner cultivator families who&#13;
were providing significantly higher levels of calories.&#13;

Kerala is the one factor which, in our judgment, has contributed most to the&#13;
improvement of the health status of infants and children." 1/&#13;
Education. Basic parameters in education are presented in Table 6.&#13;
Before discussing these in detail, it is worthwhile to compare the current&#13;
situation with that in 1950 or earlier. In 1950 the incidence of literacy&#13;
in India was just under 30% for adult males and 9% for females. In Pakistan&#13;
(including present-day Bangladesh) only 25% of adult males were counted&#13;
literate but almost 12% of the female population had attained this status. At&#13;
the extremes were Nepal where only 10% of males and less than 1% of females&#13;
were literate contrasted to Burma which at that time had already reached a&#13;
level of 55-60% adult literacy, and to Sri Lanka which had attained the&#13;
proportions 78% and 45% for males and females respectively. 2/ During the&#13;
post-war period progress in India was relatively greatest (even though the&#13;
absolute numbers of illiterates grew between 1950 and 1970). However, con-&#13;
siderable progress in female literacy was made in Sri Lanka (accounting for&#13;
about two-thirds of its overall gain between 1945 and 1970).&#13;
If literacy rates give a rough indication of the stock of basic&#13;
skills with which the period of independent development in South Asia began&#13;
a comparison of enrollment ratios in the mid-1930s with the mid-1950s is&#13;
interesting evidence of the type of strategy that was intended to provide&#13;
the human resource base for accelerated economic growth. Table 5 indicates&#13;
enrollment ratios for the two periods for Sri Lanka and India.&#13;

independence. The relatively slow progress is primary school enrollment in&#13;
India even from the low base of the 1930s is in striking contrast to Sri Lanka's&#13;
rapid progress during this period and indicates that in the education sector&#13;
India's initial policies were heavily biased toward a "capital" intensive&#13;
pattern (the returns to which appear to have been relatively low). India's&#13;
recent progress in primary school enrollment (see Table 6) clearly does repre-&#13;
sent a break with the past but this expansion has been primarily at the expense&#13;
of secondary schooling for which enrollment ratios are only little higher in&#13;
1970 than they were twenty years earlier. Higher education however has con-&#13;
tinued to expand rapidly.&#13;
Literacy in South Asia does not vary significantly from the average&#13;
for all low income countries but the range with the six countries of the&#13;
region nearly incorporates the range of the entire group. In Sri Lanka, at&#13;
the high end, only 1 in 5 persons remains illiterate contrasted with Nepal&#13;
where the same proportion is classified as literate. However, even these&#13;
national aggregates mask considerable variation. Literacy rates for women&#13;
appear to range from one-third to one-half those for males. As noted above&#13;
this differential has serious ramifications for human resource development&#13;
in education and other sectors as literate women are much more likely to&#13;
send their daughters to school, to undertake family planning, to be aware&#13;
of nutritional requirements of infants and young children, and to assume&#13;
some responsibility for the health status of their families.&#13;
Considerable inter-regional variation within countries is also&#13;
subsumed in the national aggregates. As indicated in Table 7 the range for&#13;
15 major states of India nearly encompasses the range for the region as a&#13;
whole:&#13;
Table 7&#13;
Statewide Literacy Rates for India, 1971&#13;
(est. on basis of population age 5 and above)&#13;
Kerala         69%        West Bengal       38%         Andhra Pradesh   38%&#13;
Tamil Nadu     45%        Karnataka         36%        Madhya Pradesh    25%&#13;
Maharashtra    45%        Assam &amp; Mizoram   33%         Uttar Pradesh    25%&#13;
Gujarat        41%        Haryana           31%         Bihar            23%&#13;
Punjab         39%        Orissa            30%         Rajasthan        21%&#13;
The standard deviation among these states is 12 percentage points which repre-&#13;
sents a very diverse range of conditions within India. Even within some states&#13;
there remain significant variations, as between coastal and northern Andhra&#13;
Pradesh, or coastal and northern Karnataka or coastal and southern Orissa - in&#13;
each case the coastal region have significantly higher literacy rates. While&#13;
it is difficult to separate the demand and supply sides it seems probable that&#13;
these intra-state variations reflect the significant variations in demand for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
literacy which result from variations in socio-economic conditions. 1/&#13;
Although there is relatively little variation among the four divisions&#13;
of Bangladesh with literacy rates ranging from 19% in Rajshahi to 25% in&#13;
Chittagong Division, there is wider variation among districts particularly&#13;
in female literacy with the range stretching from 8% in Rangpu to 22% in&#13;
Bakergang.&#13;
Of course, with growing coverage of the primary school system, the&#13;
incidence of illiteracy might be expected to diminish over time so that it&#13;
could not be regarded as a problem distinct from the spread of education.&#13;
However, as Table 8 makes apparent, the age distribution of literates in&#13;
India and Bangladesh is such that a high percentage of illiterates persist&#13;
even in the age ranges of 10-20 years, especially among females. Not only&#13;
will this cohort likely remain a significant drag on overall improvement&#13;
during the next twenty to thirty years but they will provide the core of&#13;
resistence to increases in primary school enrollment in the next generation.&#13;

Without a successful approach to adult literacy particularly in the age&#13;
cohort 10-19, attainment of basic literacy by greater than 40-50% of the&#13;
population will be difficult. 2/&#13;
The likelihood of little rapid progress particularly with respect&#13;
to women is further brought out in a review of the primary school enrollment&#13;
1/   The coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in particular are&#13;
associated with a much more advanced level of agricultural development.&#13;
Southern Orissa, on the other hand, is abnormally depressed because of&#13;
high concentricities of scheduled castes and tribes although agricultural&#13;
output per hectare is not significantly below that of the coastal belt.&#13;
This illustrates how social constraints may continue, in some cases, to&#13;
dominate economic factors as determinants of demand for human resource&#13;
services.&#13;
2/   In this connection it is particularly disturbing to note the deteriora-&#13;
tion in the rates for males in Bangladesh in the 10-14 age range. This&#13;
and the very low percentage of literates in the 5-9 age group (12% for&#13;
all persons as compared to 23% in India) point to significant quality&#13;
problems in the current educational system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
ratios (Table 6). While inter-country comparison must be treated cautiously&#13;
there are significant differences worthy of comment. Both Burma and Sri Lanka&#13;
have come near to achieving male/female parity at enrollment rates for persons&#13;
not significantly different from those in India and Nepal. (That both Burma&#13;
and Sri Lanka. have such significantly higher literacy rates with comparable&#13;
enrollment ratios is indicative of the much longer period that these enroll-&#13;
ment levels have been attained and of lower dropout rates resulting in a more&#13;
efficient educational system.) Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal all have&#13;
particularly serious problems with the under-enrollment of girls with the&#13;
enrollment ratio for girls in Bangladesh estimated at 38% and for Nepal and&#13;
Pakistan both at 25%.&#13;
Secondary enrollment ratios portray a slightly different picture&#13;
of regional disparity. Sri Lanka maintains a high enrollment ratio at 55%&#13;
of the relevant age group but those for the other countries fall significantly.&#13;
Table 9 indicates the ratio between secondary and primary enrollment ratios:&#13;
Table 9&#13;
Ratio of Secondary to Primary Enrollment Ratios&#13;
(mid-1970s, percentages)&#13;

/a The ratio for Bangladesh may be somewhat&#13;
overstated as the two enrollment ratios are&#13;
estimated from somewhat different sources.&#13;
Source: Table 6&#13;
The extent to which this disparity may be appropriate given differential&#13;
rates of return between primary and secondary education based on employment&#13;
prospects and other labor market characteristics will be considered below in&#13;
the discussion of economy-wide issues. However, it may certainly be argued&#13;
that a reorientation of curriculum toward content relevant to non-university&#13;
bound graduates should receive priority over secondary enrollment expansion.&#13;
Health. Indicators of the health status of South Asia, which are&#13;
presented in Table 10, indicate that the situation in South Asia differs&#13;
little from that of low-income countries as a group (which, of course, South&#13;
Asia would be expected to dominate in terms of population weighting).&#13;
As in education, the striking element of the data is the perform-&#13;
ance of Sri Lanka, which in turn raises important issues of strategy and&#13;
policy. In the first place it is apparent that neither calorie supply nor&#13;
access to safe water are necessary conditions for improvement in overall&#13;
health status. In the former case, there is remarkably little variation&#13;
among South Asia but Sri Lanka is on the low side. Of course, the aggregate&#13;
statistics can conceal quite different patterns of distribution. There is&#13;
certainly evidence to indicate that consumption is distributed more equitably&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
in Sri Lanka, especially taking into account the distribution of food subsi-&#13;
dies; however, Sri Lanka's performance in terms of health indicators was&#13;
already quite high in 1960 at a time when income was distributed considerably&#13;
less equitably than at present. 1/ In safe water supply, Sri Lanka also has&#13;
a far lower coverage than Bangladesh, India, or Pakistan with apparently little&#13;
adverse impact on relative health status. These instances simply illustrate&#13;
that health and education status are subject to multiple and interactive in-&#13;
fluences. For example, a dispersed infrastructure of basic health services,&#13;
as in Sri Lanka, combined with less nutritional vulnerability can counteract&#13;
the lack of safe water, particularly in a more literate population with con-&#13;
sequently enhanced ability to modify cooking and hygienic practices according&#13;
to environmental requirements. Without the receptivity that literacy brings,&#13;
health, sanitation, and nutritional dimensions must be attacked through&#13;
government initiatives which are rarely successful in counteracting and&#13;
exploiting the linkages which exist.&#13;
The sources of mortality which give rise to the pattern of life&#13;
expectancy and mortality reported in Table 10 are broadly similar across&#13;
South Asia. They are briefly summarized in Table 11 though the caveat must&#13;
be made that conditions of diagnosis vary tremendously and that there is&#13;
often inadequate information to distinguish between diseases with similar&#13;
symptoms.&#13;
1/   This relationship i's discussed by P. Isenman, op. cit. pp. 7-11, 24-28.&#13;
The food rationing system has undoubtedly played an important role in&#13;
Sri Lanka over the past 35 years as it has provided a minimum subsistence&#13;
floor below which low money income did not lead to starvation or mal-&#13;
nutrition. D. Gwatkin has estimated, for example, that in Sri Lanka only&#13;
5% of the population consumes fewer than 1900 calories per day while in&#13;
Bangladesh as many as 25% of the population consume fewer than 1,700&#13;
calaries (D. Gwatkin, "Nutritional Planning and Physical Well-Being in&#13;
Kerala and Sri Lanka" mimeo, Washington, D.C. 1978). Although less&#13;
extensive, the public distribution system in Kerala may have performed&#13;
a similar role in improving nutritional status. See S. Kumar "Impact&#13;
of Subsidized Rice on Food Consumption and Nutrition in Kerala" IFPRI,&#13;
Washington, D.C. 1979. In Kerala, the widespread cultivation of cassava,&#13;
may also provide an effective floor at least in terms of calories.&#13;

Another major caveat is that these data do not reflect the serious, underlying&#13;
debilitating conditions which dominate daily life in South Asia, such as low&#13;
levels of nutrition and inadequate environmental sanitation and personal&#13;
hygiene. Attacking these factors directly through preventive programs could&#13;
dramatically improve the reported mortality and morbidity conditions. These&#13;
data also serve to suggest the major causes of time lost due to illness. Two&#13;
pieces of evidence from India indicate the potential magnitude of the effect&#13;
of morbidity on productivity and employment in South Asia. Recently summary&#13;
results from the Rural Labor Enquiry indicate that over 25 days per year are&#13;
reported lost due to illness by men in rural labor households and over 43 days&#13;
are similarly reported by women. Both these figures were above the levels&#13;
reported ten years earlier in the preceding Rural Labor Enquiry, the difference&#13;
being 7 days for men and over 18 days for women. Fewer days were reported lost&#13;
by children - 20 days in 1974 - but there was marked deterioration over 1964/65&#13;
when only 11 days were so reported. 1/   The second piece of evidence concerning&#13;
the incidence of morbidity dates from a 1956 survey of four community develop-&#13;
ment blocks in Rajasthan which reported an average duration of illness per&#13;
person per year of 41 days for ages one to five years, 37 days for ages 5 to&#13;
15 years, and 73 days for ages 15 to 55 years. 2/   Although figures of this&#13;
magnitude may not now be so widely prevalent because of the expansion of cura-&#13;
tive services, the underlying debilitating conditions referred to above have not&#13;
changed dramatically so that indirect losses in earnings and output through low&#13;

productive capacity are likely to be still an effective constraint on the&#13;
alleviation of poverty through "traditional" expansion of economic activity.&#13;
Malnutrition is undoubtedly the single most widespread and severe&#13;
health problem in South Asia. In spite of recent improvements in the per-&#13;
capita availability of foodgrains, significant portions of the population&#13;
are estimated to suffer from inordinately low calorie intake and inadequate&#13;
levels of protein and deficiencies in various micro-nutrients. While there&#13;
are numerous measurement problems which confound various estimates of the&#13;
extent of malnutrition, none of these alters the basic situation that in all&#13;
South Asian countries, excepting Burma, there exists an aggregate calorie&#13;
deficiency in relation to average requirements varying from 5-11% in the&#13;
mid-1970s. 1/ In India where average food intake appears the lowest in rela-&#13;
tion to "requirements," various local nutritional surveys have established&#13;
that as many as 40% of pre-school children in moderate and low income groups&#13;
exhibited some clinical signs of malnutrition. Common features of such&#13;
studies are the far greater prevalence of malnutrition among female than&#13;
male children and among higher than lower birth orders.&#13;
In Pakistan, the National Nutrition Survey indicated that about&#13;
46% of families have inadequate caloric intake. Again, the main impact of&#13;
family deficits is born by women and children. This impact could be quite&#13;
severe, for as many as 11% of the families, consumption standards were less&#13;
than 70% of the recommended levels. Micro-nutrient deficiencies involved&#13;
vitamin A, iron deficiency anemia, riboflavin, vitamin C and iodine in north-&#13;
ern areas. These deficiencies greatly increase individual susceptibility&#13;
to disease. Due to the rapid population growth of recent years in Nepal&#13;
compounded by stagnating paddy production, food availability and the inci-&#13;
dence of malnutrition have significantly worsened in that country during the&#13;
past decade. A recent WHO survey reported severe "protein-energy" malnutri-&#13;
tion among 5-15% of the children a level wbich the organization ranks as&#13;
among the highest in the world. Again there are problems of maldistribution&#13;
with calorie supply for the 60% of Nepal's population living in the hills&#13;
and mountains considerably below the 95% average for the country as a whole.&#13;
Indeed some 17% of the Hill.population are considered severely undernourished.&#13;
Iodine deficiency is a severe micronutrient problem with as many as 50% of&#13;
the entire population affected. Bangladesh has suffered similarly serious&#13;

Poverty Estimates, draft mimeo. The problems relate, inter alia to&#13;
(i) appropriate definitions of nutritional standards, (ii) the distribu-&#13;
tion of individual nutritional requirements around the estimated mean&#13;
and to (iii) the lack of data on intra-family allocations which could&#13;
considerably alter the nutritional impact of aggregated household&#13;
estimates.&#13;

problems with sharp rural-urban disparities and high seasonal variation in&#13;
the availability of food. 1/&#13;
The organization of health services follows basically the same&#13;
pattern throughout the region: the rural health center is intended as the&#13;
basic unit from which community-oriented health activities at the village&#13;
level are supervised and difficult cases are referred to the much less pre-&#13;
valent rural or district hospitals. The rural center is therefore expected&#13;
to be the primary locus of supervisory activity for preventative and promotive&#13;
services. This basic pattern was enunciated as long ago as 1946 in the "Bohr&#13;
Committee" report. However, wholehearted acceptance of this approach is still&#13;
far from widespread among political and social leaders and medical practitioners&#13;
each with their own special interests to protect. Furthermore, the existing&#13;
health infrastructure is ill-adapted to shift rapidly to a low-cost promotive&#13;
and preventive approach to health care.&#13;
As illustrated in Table 12, there is significant variation in the&#13;
incidence of both doctors and nurses in the populations of the six countries.&#13;

The most striking factor, however, is the extreme difference in the ratio of&#13;
doctors to nurses in South Asia, excepting Sri Lanka, to that in other low&#13;
1/   It is striking that Sri Lanka can sustain aggregate health outcomes far&#13;
above those of other South Asian countries with per-capita availability&#13;
of calories at a level 9% below average requirements (lowest but one&#13;
of the countries in the region). Much more equitable distribution of&#13;
calories due to the foodgrain ration system, better utilization of food&#13;
due to the widespread availability of health services, and better intra-&#13;
family distribution due to high levels of female literacy undoubtedly all&#13;
play a role in explaining this apparent anomaly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
income countries.  This ratio which is close to unity in low-income countries&#13;
generally and less than one-half in middle-income countries averages 2.5 for&#13;
South Asia (again excluding Sri Lanka). The rationale is that South Asia has&#13;
roughly twice the low income country average number of doctors per capita&#13;
combined with a slightly lower than the average number of nurses per-capita.&#13;
As performance on health indicators for South Asia is approximately comparable&#13;
to that for low-income countries in general, it would appear that the approach&#13;
followed in South Asia has, at least in a macro-sense, utilized highly trained&#13;
manpower to substitute for facilities, and particularly for middle-level per-&#13;
sonnel. Judged on the basis of health outcomes, this would appear to have&#13;
been an inefficient strategy more concerned with promoting a medical infra-&#13;
structure than with developing human resources. As a result most South Asia&#13;
countries are ill-prepared to make the transition to the decentralized, rural-&#13;
oriented health delivery system that is now widely recognized as appropriate.&#13;
In contrast, Sri Lanka's achievement in the health sector has not relied on&#13;
heavy investments in manpower training. The key elements seem rather to have&#13;
been an appropriate ratio of middle-level manpower and a broad-based provision&#13;
of infrastructure that promoted easy accessibility.&#13;
A final aspect of the health system in South Asia which should not&#13;
be underestimated in importance though difficult to quantify concerns the&#13;
role of indigenous systems of medicine, particularly the homeopathic,&#13;
ayurvedic, and unani systems. 1/ These are officially recognized in most&#13;
South Asian countries and governments generally support training in them. 2/&#13;
Although the extent of their influence has not been systematically evaluated&#13;
they do provide widespread coverage even in remote rural areas and therefore&#13;
generally more accessible to the bulk of the population. In Bangladesh it has&#13;
been estimated that 75% of medical consultations are provided by practitioners&#13;
of indigenous systems. Although government support has brought improvements&#13;
to the practice of these systems, it has not succeeded any more than with&#13;
regard to the western systems in reorienting activities toward promotive and&#13;
preventive aspects of health. Dais or traditional midwives are also extremely&#13;
widespread in rural South Asia. There have been efforts to involve these&#13;
personnel in family planning promotion, but this has again not spread rapidly&#13;
as an activity. The training of dai's in fundamentals of hygiene probably has&#13;
played an important part in reducing both infant and maternal mortality. Low&#13;
social acceptability of these ttaditional practitioners in new roles and&#13;
functions, often compounded by their own antipathy to modern, preventive&#13;
1/   Briefly homeopathic medicine relies on the use of "natural" remedies as&#13;
contrasted to drug-based treatment of allopathic or western medicine.&#13;
Ayurvedic practice follows the precepts of the Hindu Vedas while the&#13;
Unani system was developed under the Moghuls and is based on the&#13;
ancient Greek concept of four humors which must be kept in balance to&#13;
maintain health.&#13;
2/   Large numbers of registered medical practitioners under these various&#13;
systems contribute to the low population per doctor figures for India&#13;
and Pakistan recorded in Table 12. For example, in India in 1976 only&#13;
32% of registered medical practitioners were trained in "western,"&#13;
allopathic medicine. Of the remainder approximately one-third were&#13;
trained in homeopathy and two-thirds in ayurvedic and unani practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

concepts has proved to be a significant obstacle, at least in some areas of&#13;
the region.&#13;
Economy Wide Issues in Human Resource Development&#13;
Given the generally low levels of human resource development in&#13;
South Asia and the obvious requirement of significant government involvement&#13;
and investment in the sector if improvements are to be made, the question&#13;
natually arises of the linkages between human resource development and the&#13;
important economy-wide issues of growth, productivity, and poverty. Tradi-&#13;
tional analysis has focussed on the rates of return to investments in education&#13;
as measured by years of attainment and similarly on productivity effects of&#13;
improvements in health status. Also important in the context of development&#13;
policy are the linkages among human resource sectors particularly health,&#13;
education, nutrition, and family planning and the relationship between&#13;
poverty alleviation and human resource development.&#13;
Returns to Human Resource Investments. The formal calculation&#13;
of rates of return to education in South Asia has been undertaken primarily&#13;
with respect to India and the relevant studies have been reviewed elsewhere. 1/&#13;
Most such studies have been limited to cross-sectional samples of data col-&#13;
lected during the 1960s from urban areas for males within single industries.&#13;
The rapid expansion of educational cohorts during the late 1960s and early&#13;
1970s must have had a depressing effect on returns particularly in view of&#13;
stagnating income and employment during the decade 1965-75. Nevertheless,&#13;
certain conclusions appear plausible, in particular the structure of rates&#13;
of return (both private and social) which appear to decline, almost without&#13;
exception, from primary through middle, secondary and graduate levels. Table&#13;
13 summarizes the information indicating that social rates of return to pri-&#13;
mary education averaging almost 3 percentage points above those for middle&#13;
and secondary school, which in turn average more than 3 points above those&#13;
for baccalaureate.&#13;

None of these rate of return studies have made appropriate adjustments for&#13;
shadow prices or distribution weights: such revisions should result in some-&#13;
what higher rates although these may be offsetting factors. 1/ At any rate,&#13;
these calculations would not contradict a view of the returns to educational&#13;
investment in India as not radically out of line with returns to investment in&#13;
other sectors at least in the 1960s.&#13;
An important factor which has dampened rates of return to certain&#13;
educational investments beyon"d the primary level in all South Asian countries&#13;
is the high incidence of unemployment particularly among secondary and college&#13;
generalists. The situation in Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and India is summarized&#13;

1/   The use of shadow wage rates for unskilled labor would reduce the&#13;
opportunity costs of foregone employment but could also reduce post-&#13;
education returns depending on the extent to which graduate unemploy-&#13;
ment rates were taken into account in theL original studies. While&#13;
the distributional impact of past educational investments has been&#13;
regressive thus depressing past average rates of return, future&#13;
expansion of the educational system, especially at the primary and&#13;
middle levels would be more redistributive.&#13;

The rate of unemployment for all graduates in India was estimated by the&#13;
Planning Committee to 10.8% in 1977/78. This figure varied considerably&#13;
by sector from 1.9% among medical graduates to 16.1% among science graduetes.&#13;
Although India places heavy emphasis on employment creation in her current&#13;
five-year plan, that document projects the rate of graduate unemployment to&#13;
increase to 15% by 1983 with over 40% of the increase in the number of arts,&#13;
science, and commerce graduates remaining unemployed through 1983.&#13;
Although much less information is available concerning human&#13;
resource development in Burma, a recent study of manpower utilization reveals&#13;
significant imbalances with surplusses in the professional categories which&#13;
would imply an unemployment rate for graduates in 1981-82 well over 20%. In&#13;
contrast sub-professionals and skilled workers are in short supply, a situa-&#13;
tion which is expected to worsen over the medium term. Significant unemploy-&#13;
ment re-emerges at the semi-skilled level corresponding to middle school&#13;
graduates with the 1978/79 underutilization rate of 10.6% forecast to grow&#13;
to 16% by the mid-1980s. 2/ While crude labor market information such as&#13;
this cannot tell one much concerning the economics of education in Burma it&#13;
does imply that the mesh between the economy and the output of the education&#13;
system is by no means an even one.&#13;
The length of unemployment in both Pakistan and India has been&#13;
found to be positively correlated with educational status indicating that&#13;
those who are better educated can afford to wait for suitable employment (or&#13;
at least until expectations and opportunities come more into balance). The&#13;
age breakdown illustrates another dimension of the problem, namely its con-&#13;
centration among younger age groups. In sum there appears to be a queuing&#13;
operation at work after graduation for those with higher educational creden-&#13;
tials. Once employed subsequent periods of unemployment for graduates are&#13;
significantly reduced. Unfortunately, time series data on the queueing&#13;
phenomenon in South Asia do not permit an analysis of the co-variance among&#13;
length of queues, age of participants and rates of economic growth. Although,&#13;
given the generally poor growth performance in South Asia during the early&#13;
1970s, one should be somewhat circumspect in reaching conclusions, it would&#13;

it has been estimated that as many as 50% of the output of graduate&#13;
institutions including polytechnics were unemployed or in jobs&#13;
unrelated to graduate training up to 6 months after graduation.&#13;
This statistic would appear to reflect an employment situation at&#13;
least as bad a those reported in Table 14.&#13;

appear that further expansion of the primary education should receive much&#13;
greater relative emphasis than it has in the *past. 1/&#13;
Many would argue that the greatest pay-off from education to the&#13;
development of South Asia relates to indirect, and even non-market, effects&#13;
of education on the economy. For example, literacy and numeracy have been&#13;
correlated with more rapid adoption of technological change in agriculture.&#13;
Research conducted in the Terai region of Nepal has confirmed the significance&#13;
of numeracy, in particular, as a determinant of enhanced agricultural perform-&#13;
ance. When an identifiable technological package involving water, fertilizer,&#13;
high-yielding varieties, and credit is readily available as it is in much&#13;
of South Asia, the economic returns of the more rapid and successful adop-&#13;
tion of the package brought about through widespread literacy and numeracy&#13;
can be quite significant. Literacy and numeracy can also make a significant&#13;
contribution to the more rapid spread of community based decentralized plan-&#13;
ning which, though widely accepted as desirable in South Asia, has yet to be&#13;
implemented to any perceptible degree. Further, the role of education in&#13;
breaking down communal and sectarian barriers, although impossible to quan-&#13;
tify, should not be discounted in a region with such deep and persistent&#13;
cultural divisions. Education brings with it many non-quantifiable but&#13;
important constituents of structural change such as adaptability, "modern"&#13;
attitudes, and accelerated aspirations. It is likely that if South Asian&#13;
economies are to begin the transition to a period of sustained industriali-&#13;
zation, these factors related to basic education could be crucial in facili-&#13;
tating the shift of manpower from traditional to modern, non-agricultural&#13;
activities and thereby sustaining the process of structural transformation. 2/&#13;

health and nutrition improvements on productivity can be strongly presumed&#13;
1/   This may seem a somewhat tentative endorsement given the current&#13;
received wisdom that primary education has been relatively underfunded&#13;
and inadequately stressed in most developing countries. But the only&#13;
rate of return study in India based on an all-India sample of males&#13;
and females found higher rates of return to middle-school than to&#13;
primary education (15.5 as opposed to 13.4%). Returns to middle school&#13;
education may reflect more of a screening element than returns to&#13;
primary education and the non-market effects discussed in the following&#13;
paragraph are also likely to be associated to a relatively greater&#13;
extent with primary completion so that one cannot place excessive&#13;
reliance on a single rate-of-return study.&#13;
2/   The export of educated manpower from South Asian countries has recently&#13;
grown dramatically in magnitude and illustrates the capacity for respond-&#13;
ing to structural imbalances and resulting demands though in this case&#13;
the growth effects are external to the countries in question with foreign&#13;
exchange remittances the primary benefit. Some analyses have questioned&#13;
whether the benefit cost ratio exceeds unity in this process and further&#13;
investigations have been undertaken. For the purpose at hand one may&#13;
note that those states and regions within countries benefitting rela-&#13;
tively more are precisely the areas with significantly higher levels of&#13;
educational attainment (e.g. Kerala and Punjab in India).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
because of the widespread incidence of malnutrition and morbidity, l/ there&#13;
has been little success in quantifying their impact on growth. However,&#13;
recent work in the case of Sri Lanka has quantified some of the linkages&#13;
between various dimensions of human resource development. In particular, Sri&#13;
Lanka's high life expectancy accounts for about 3/4 of the difference between&#13;
Sri Lanka's expected fertility rate (based on cross-section regression analysis&#13;
among countries with per-capita income as the independent variable) and her&#13;
actual rate of almost half the expected value. Furthermore, using similar&#13;
techniques Sri Lanka's higher than "expected" literacy rate was found to&#13;
account for over one-half the difference in life expectancy between "expected"&#13;
and actual values. 2/ A similar relationship has been demonstrated for Kerala&#13;
among the states of India. 3/&#13;
Improved health and nutrition status is equally likely to have an&#13;
important effect on the productivity of investments of education. Perhaps&#13;
as many as 50% of children attending primary school and a much greater per-&#13;
centage of those children from poor families who do attend school have vir-&#13;
tually no meal either before or during the school day. Even if eventually&#13;
their individual low-level calorie requirements are met, the daily pattern&#13;
of hunger and associated listlessness must be a factor in poor learning&#13;
retention, disillusionment with school and eventual dropping out, factors&#13;
which considerably reduce the efficiency of investments in primary education.&#13;
An effect of better nutrition on school enrollment has been hypothesized&#13;
from the association of high primary enrollment ratios and school feeding&#13;
programs; in terms of an incentive, school-feeding functions like any other&#13;
subsidy which can be costed out in terms of augmented family resources. But&#13;
efforts to document a relationship between school feeding and health or&#13;
education performance have been neither frequent nor successful. 4/&#13;
1/   See section on current health status above.   It has been estimated that&#13;
in any given week one-quarter of the population of India is ill, with&#13;
the morbidity rate over twice as great in rural as in urban areas - 29.5%&#13;
to 13.1% (World Bank&#13;
2/   World Bank unpublished report and P. Isenman .L. cit.    Although the&#13;
cross-national correlations cannot by themselves confirm causality,&#13;
they are consistent with intra-country longitudinal data as reported&#13;
by Cochrane, et. al., op. cit.&#13;
3/   P. G. K. Panikar, "Resources Not the Constraint on Health Improvement:&#13;
A Case Study of Kerala," Political and Economic Weekly, op. cit.&#13;
4/   One of the few studies of the impact of school-feeding was conducted&#13;
in Orissa in 1970-72. It concluded that class enrollments particu-&#13;
larly in lower primary were enhanced by school feeding, especially in&#13;
tribal areas. There was also some indication that the incidence of&#13;
long-term absenteeism due to illness and drop-out rates were reduced&#13;
but these data were not statistically significant. See P. Roy and&#13;
R.N. Rath, School Lunch in Orissa, Council for Social Development,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
Another obvious point which nevertheless should be noted in the&#13;
context of South Asia is the reciprocal effect of longer life expectancy&#13;
and reduced morbidity on increasing the returns to education, essentially&#13;
by extending the recovery period and allowing for greater intensity of&#13;
work resulting in greater productivity. This would be particularly true&#13;
for individuals having attained middle and secondary levels for whom there&#13;
may well be, if data from developed countries is any guide, an interaction&#13;
between experience and years of schooling in shifting out the lifetime&#13;
earnings path. l/&#13;
Human Resource Development and Poverty. The relative magnitude&#13;
of the poverty problem in South Asia varies considerably among countries.&#13;
Sri Lanka appears to be at the low end with "acute" poverty characterizing&#13;
approximately 22% of the population. In Pakistan an estimated 35% of the&#13;
rural population and 23.3% of the urban were classified below the poverty&#13;
line while in India the respective estimates were 48% of the rural popula-&#13;
tion and 41% of the urban population below the poverty line as defined by&#13;
the Planning Commission. Lower income levels in Bangladesh result in an&#13;
estimated 60% of the rural population in 1976/77 being considered extremely&#13;
poor. 2/ Based on these estimates, a rough calculation of the extent of&#13;
poverty in South Asia in 1980 yields a figure of approximately 410 million&#13;
persons corresponding to an average incidence in the region of 46%. 3/.&#13;
1/   Of course, it is true, as noted above, that education and literacy&#13;
also have significant effects on health outcomes and longevity. This&#13;
reciprocal relationship is an important reason why the expansion of&#13;
health services should be viewed as a complementary investment to&#13;
programs for universalizing primary education or adult literacy.&#13;
2/   The definitions and sources for these various estimates are diverse but&#13;
some rough comparability should exist. For Pakistan, the estimate is&#13;
derived from adjusted Planning Division estimates reported in Employment&#13;
Strategy - Pakistan, ILO, Geneva, 1977. The Sri Lanka estimates are&#13;
based on the income levels necessary "to sustain a consumption level&#13;
considered acceptable relative to minimum welfare standards." P. J.&#13;
Alailima, "A Profile of Poverty in Sri Lanka," mimeo, undated. The&#13;
Indian estimates are based on the mid-point of the expenditure class&#13;
associated with purchasing power sufficient to obtain "recommended&#13;
nutritional requirements," as reported in the Draft Five Year Plan, GOI,&#13;
New Delhi, 1978. The Bangladesh figures are based on a per-capita income&#13;
level representing 85 percent of the minimum recommended average calorie&#13;
standard. 86 percent of the Bangladesh population live in households with&#13;
per-capita incomes below the level associated with average recommended&#13;
calorie intake. These estimates are reported in 0. Nijhawan, Bangladesh:&#13;
Consumption Levels, Inequality and Poverty 1963-1976, draft mimeo, 1979.&#13;
3/   The average incidence for the four countries discussed above was applied&#13;
to Burma and Nepal to get a rough estimate of the overall extent of poverty&#13;
in the region. Variations in the poverty line which correspond to one&#13;
or another interpretation of "hardcore" poverty would obviously affect&#13;
this percentage which is admittedly arbitrary. I. J. Singh reviews the&#13;
range of estimates and their various implications in Annex I to his Small&#13;
Farmers and the Landless in South Asia, World Bank Working Paper No. 320.&#13;

In order to evaluate strategies for poverty alleviation and their&#13;
relationship to human resource development, it is important to understand, at&#13;
least in broad terms, the characteristics of poor households with respect to&#13;
their occupational and social status as well as their human resource attain-&#13;
ments. In broad terms the rural poor in India have been grouped in four major&#13;
categories: (i) landless agricultural laborers; (ii) agricultural labor&#13;
households with very little land (too little to serve as a significant source&#13;
of income); (iii) other rural labor household dependent on non-farm employment;&#13;
and (iv) small farmers with fewer than five acres (and usually with higher&#13;
than average dependency ratios). 1/ Further evidence on the distribution of&#13;
poor persons in terms of usual activity is indicated for two Indian states in&#13;

bracket the all-India average. Clearly employees and agricultural laborers,&#13;
in particular, are much more heavily represented among the poor than in the&#13;
population at large. While there are also significant numbers of owner-&#13;
cultivators among the poor, very few of these operate significant holdings&#13;
as the average size of land holding of cultivating households in the lower two&#13;
deciles was 4.5 acres in Gujarat and 4.9 in Maharashtra compared to statewide&#13;
averages of 7.4 and 7.6 acres respectively (again excluding landless households). 1/&#13;
A similar profile of the poor characterizes other South Asian coun-&#13;
tries. A socio-economic survey of Sri Lanka undertaken in 1969/70 indicates&#13;
that almost 40% of the poor were estate laborers with another 9% general&#13;
agricultural labor. Poor cultivators accounted for almost 30% of the total&#13;
with remainder made up of laborers in non-farm enterprises and individuals&#13;
self-employed in traditional activities. 2/ While comparable occupational&#13;
breakdown is not available for Bangladesh, Table 16 indicates sources of&#13;
household income for the lower four income deciles (aggregated) compared to&#13;
all groups for 1973/74 and 1976/77.&#13;

It is clear that the poor receive a significantly lower proportion of their&#13;
income from agriculture than the population at large; furthermore, this pro-&#13;
portion declined during the 1970s with a growing proletization of the poor&#13;
(indeed of all groups) as the proportion of income originating from wage labor&#13;
1/   The average per-capita land-holding of poor households is less than half&#13;
the statewide averages because household sizes are inversely correlated&#13;
with monthly per-capita expenditure levels (although there is a positive&#13;
correlation between size of land-holding and family size).&#13;
2/   Although a comparable breakdown for all income groups is not available,&#13;
estate workers constituted only 12% of all households as compared to 17%&#13;
of households receiving less than Rs. 200/month in 1969/70 (the poverty&#13;
criterion used in the occupational breakdown). Figures in the text refer&#13;
to proportions of income receivers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
increased markedly. l/ The reduced importance of agricultural income is&#13;
underscored by the distribution of land ownership in Bangladesh where over&#13;
three-fourths of rural households hold slightly over 20% of the cultivable&#13;
land. An estimated 50% of rural households in Bangladesh are e-timated to&#13;
be "functionally" landless according to the Land Occupancy Survey of 1978. 2/&#13;
The situation in Pakistan is less clear, but evidence from a 1971/1972 house-&#13;
hold survey indicates that 30% of rural households whose head was self-employed&#13;
fell below a poverty line of Rs. 30 per month per capita (1971/1972 prices)&#13;
while 35% of households with wage-earner heads were classified as poor under&#13;
the same criterion. These percentages are not dissimilar from the 1973/1974&#13;
figures for Bangladesh. Whether or not a shift of the poor into the wage-&#13;
earner category has also occurred during the 1970s in Pakistan, it seems clear&#13;
that a general pattern prevails across the region. Low productivity and&#13;
income with resulting depressed consumption levels is concentrated among&#13;
agricultural labor households and among cultivators with marginal landholdings.&#13;
Furthermore, the significance of agricultural labor households in characteriz-&#13;
ing the poor appears to have generally increased during the past decade. 3/&#13;
With little direct access to complementary inputs, whether land&#13;
or capital, the status of human resource development among the poor becomes&#13;
an important consideration in assessing the prospects for improving levels of&#13;
welfare. Although the distribution of educational and health outcomes appears&#13;
less skewed than income or physical assets (see, for example, Table 17 below),&#13;
the poor are still at a significant disadvantage. Available data from India&#13;
indicate that literacy rates are uniformly positively associated with family&#13;
mean per-capita expenditure. 4/ The dynamic aspects of this relationship are&#13;
indicated by the association of literacy rates for different age cohorts with&#13;
family expenditure. The analysis of P. Visaria indicates that while younger&#13;
groups in all expenditure deciles have higher proportions of literates, the&#13;
literacy rates for individuals, age 45-49, in the top two expenditure deciles&#13;
were up to 40% higher than individuals, age 10-15, in the lower two expenditure&#13;
deciles. Over time the sex differential in literacy attainment has tended to&#13;
disappear among the top expenditures deciles but not among the bottom deciles.&#13;
Thus while literacy in India does appear to be spreading among the poor, with&#13;
1/   The major source of this shift for the poor was a reduced role for&#13;
"other" income sources. The extent to which these changes might relate&#13;
to definitional changes between surveys is not known.&#13;

2/   This discussion draws heavily on the presentation of P. Visaria in&#13;
Living Standards, Employment and Education in Western India, 1972-73,&#13;

and Gujarat. The data stem from the National Sample Survey, Round 27,&#13;

15-29 was less than half the improvement of the 15-29 cohort over the&#13;

These data illustrate that across South Asia, the differential&#13;
degree of participation in the educational system by income class varies&#13;
strikingly. The lowest income class in Sri Lanka participates in primary&#13;
education at a rate about 50% greater than children of the highest class&#13;
in Bangladesh and 15% greater than in India. Nevertheless, there remained&#13;
a differential of 24 percentage points in participation rates between the&#13;
top and bottom classes in Sri Lanka. This was about the same as the top to&#13;
bottom differential in Bangladesh but considerably less than the 34-37 point&#13;
differential in India. Sex differentials among income classes are also quite&#13;
pronounced. In India these differentials practically disappear in the top&#13;
expenditure decile but female participation rates average only 60-70% of male&#13;
rates through all other deciles (even dropping to 30% for the bottom deciles&#13;
in Gujarat).&#13;
These data make clear that programs which aim at the universaliza-&#13;
tion of primary education will necessarily be progressive in their impact on&#13;
the distribution of public services and perhaps ultimately on the distribution&#13;
of income through improved earning capacity for children of the poor. Such&#13;
a result would be much more difficult to predict in the case of the extension&#13;
of health services. On the one hand, it is certainly true that the poor&#13;
in South Asia are characterized by lower health status. Even in Sri Lanka&#13;
with an extensive health care system which is apparently utilized by the poor&#13;
as frequently as by the rich, the morbidity rates for those in the lowest&#13;
income groups were 12.5% higher than the average for all groups. Similarly&#13;
poor families were estimated to suffer an incidence of third-degree protein-&#13;
calorie malnutrition (weight loss of 40% relative to normal weight for height&#13;
standard) of close to 20% - a condition which did not occur in the highest&#13;
income group at all. 1/ On the other hand, it is much less easy to identify&#13;
the actual impact on health of alternative health service patterns. It is&#13;
quite likely that even if the poor had equal access to health services that&#13;
outcomes would still be skewed in favor of the better nourished and better&#13;
housed. Furthermore, in the highly stratified environment of many South&#13;
Asian villages, equal access itself would be very difficult to define since&#13;
the distribution of many health services depends greatly on demand, which,&#13;
particularly in the absence of widespread literacy, is likely to be skewed&#13;
decidedly in favor of the relatively advantaged groups.&#13;
One aspect of the maldistribution of health services which undoubted-&#13;
ly contributes to limiting their impact on poverty alleviation is a strong&#13;
urban bias. Data from India indicate that as many as 75% of all hospitals and&#13;
89% of all hospital beds were in urban areas (having 20% of the population).&#13;
1/   P.J. Alailima, op. cit.   Using the same income classes as in Table 17&#13;
above, Alailima reports that the percentage of population attending&#13;
government health facilities in Sri Lanka rises slightly from 22% in&#13;
the lowest income group (below Rs 100) to 24% in the next three groups&#13;
(spanning Rs 100 to Rs 599) and then declining to only 11% among those&#13;
in the highest income group (who rely on private practitioners to a&#13;
much greater extent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The urban death rate was about 60% of the rural rate with the comparison of&#13;
infant mortality rates being only slightly less favorable. 1/ And, although&#13;
the environmental conditions of urban slums are often decried it is estimated&#13;
in India that only 28% of urban dwellings have walls of poor or inadequate&#13;
materials while 70% of rural houses fall into this category. Of course, urban&#13;
health services are often available to those from rural areas but it is quite&#13;
unlikely that the rural poor would be proportionately represented. Under these&#13;
circumstances simply more rapid extension of basic health facilities to rural&#13;
areas would be likely to have a redistributive effect even if special redis-&#13;
tributive provisions were not built into the programs.&#13;
Internal Efficiency in the Delivery of Human Resource Services.&#13;
While the preponderance of evidence presented in the previous section&#13;
implies that human resource development could make a significant impact on&#13;
poverty alleviation, the countries of South Asia must operate under severe&#13;
resource constraints which lead many observers to question whether more rapid&#13;
prgress in human resource investment is possble. While a redistribution of&#13;
public expenditures toward the human resource sectors need not damage, indeed&#13;
should enhance long-term growth prospects, the efficiency of present delivery&#13;
systems in education and health is so poor that a simultaneous restructuring&#13;
would be required to justify any significant reallocation of resources. Sig-&#13;
nificant elements of this restructuring could be and in some cases are being&#13;
undertaken without significant budgetary commitment and should result in better&#13;
outcomes in the context of "normal" expenditure growth. Nevertheless, it&#13;
seems clear that long-term improvement will require an increased share of&#13;
government resources directed to human resource development. In some sectors&#13;
and countries, this may not necessarily imply an increased share of GDP. For&#13;
example, in Pakistan it is estimated that private expenditures on health&#13;
exceed by a factor of three-to-four expenditures in the public sector. Almost&#13;
50% of these expenditures go to physicians in private practice and another 20%&#13;
to traditional healers. Programs which broaden the access to preventive and&#13;
simple curative care and which provide support for individuals to take greater&#13;
responsibility for their own health could considerably reduce private sector&#13;
expenditures while improving health care standards. But the initial years of&#13;
any widespread promotive, preventive program will likely require higher levels&#13;
of government expenditure without any immediate fall-off in private, curative&#13;
expenditure.&#13;
Comparable estimates for direct private expenditures on education&#13;
do not exist but it is likely that these will constitute a significant&#13;
portion of public expenditures although the distribution of private and&#13;
public expenditures will vary among educational stages.    In Bangladesh rough&#13;
estimates put direct private expenditure on education, primarily at the&#13;
secondary and college level, equal to approximately one-half government&#13;
expenditures. This proportion is likely to be less in Pakistan and India&#13;
where government assumes responsibility for all schools. In general, South&#13;
1/   The incidence of infant mortality is an estimated 80 per thousand in urban&#13;
areas to 115 in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Asian countries spend relatively less than other low income countries on&#13;
education: referring back to Table 6, expenditures as a proportion of GDP&#13;
for the six South Asian countries ranged from 38% of the norm for low income&#13;
countries in the case of Nepal to 82% of the norm in the case of India. 1/&#13;
Sri Lanka was also high at 79% of the norm with all remaining countries around&#13;
50%. Those countries which are less than half of the low-income country norms&#13;
of public expenditure to GDP - Nepal, Bangladesh and Burma - are unlikely to&#13;
be able to significantly improve the quality or coverage of service without&#13;
relative increases in expenditure. In contrast, India with performance levels&#13;
considerably below those of Sri Lanka should be able to make considerable&#13;
progress from reallocation within the sector.&#13;
The usual pattern of expenditures per student being highly skewed&#13;
toward upper educational levels is very pronounced in South Asia. Table 18&#13;
presents some representative calculations for the three major countries.&#13;
Table 18: RATIOS OF EDUCATIONAL EXPENDITURES PER STUDENT BY LEVEL&#13;
Year      Prima      Secondary to Primary     Graduate to Primary&#13;
India          69/70        5               208                     6,810&#13;
Bangladesh     74/75      3-4               143                     4,286&#13;
Pakistan       75/76       17               250                     1,694&#13;
These disparities would be even greater if the wastage at early stages of&#13;
primary education did not significantly reduce enrollments.     As the estimated&#13;
dropout rates in Table 6 indicate less than half the number of students that&#13;
entered the 1st class, complete the 5th. This means that on average from 10&#13;
to 12.5 years of instruction is given for every primary school graduate from&#13;
the 5 year program. This situation worsens if adjustments are made for actual&#13;
attendance as opposed to official enrollment. Typical attendance averages&#13;
only about two-thirds for both students and teachers in Bangladesh and is&#13;
reportedly not much better in parts of India and Pakistan. 2/ The effect&#13;
of absenteeism in Bangladesh is such that on an average of every other day&#13;
the teaching and supervision load of students per teacher would be doubled to&#13;
over 80. The implications of these rates of teacher absenteeism are discour-&#13;
aging for those hoping that a revitalization of the existing primary education&#13;
structure could improve the efficiency of the whole system. With many teachers&#13;
rarely in attendance, and a large percentage of those who are, preoccupied&#13;
mainly with keeping order while relying almost exclusively on rote learning&#13;
techniques of instruction, there is little basis for reform.&#13;
1/   Part of the explanation may relate to the relatively low wage levels in&#13;
South Asia for skilled manpower (as compared to other low-income coun-&#13;
tries). On the basis of purchasing power parity exchange rate conver-&#13;
sions, the position of South Asia would improve but the relative rankings&#13;
within the region and general conclusion are unlikely to be significantly&#13;
altered.&#13;
2/   This may be the "reverse" side of the low-wage standards for primary&#13;
teachers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
If the consequences of poor teacher motivation are regrettable, the&#13;
causes are understandable. Living conditions in rural areas are often diffi-&#13;
cult and many teachers are "forced" or choose to live a considerable distance&#13;
from their schools. A survey in Bangladesh revealed that almost 20% of all&#13;
teachers reside three or more miles from the school, a distance which could&#13;
require from three to four hours per day in commuting (on foot). The conditions&#13;
in schools are hardly encouraging to those teachers who do come. Schools are&#13;
often ill-constructed, without pacca walls, floors or roofs in almost half the&#13;
cases.  While education can certainly be conducted in the open or under primi-&#13;
tive shelters, this bucolic "ideal" fails in monsoon weather, in the summer&#13;
dust and heat, and never, even in the best weather, can it provide the teaching&#13;
and storage facilities necessary for a modernized curriculum. The type of&#13;
facilities which are often not available are not "frills" to a basic education.&#13;
They include blackboards, benches for seating, rudimentary play areas and maps.&#13;
In addition almost 70% of the schools in Bangladesh have no sanitary facilities&#13;
- a statistic which is unlikely to be out of line with conditions throughout&#13;
South Asia. 1/ This factor alone is an important impediment to an increase&#13;
in the enrollment and attendance of girls in rural areas. 2/&#13;

The impact of these factors is perhaps best summed up by the authors of&#13;
the NFHRD survey, "most of our schools are ugly, gloomy and forlorn. They&#13;
fail to inspire lofty imagination or to provide a nice parlance for the&#13;
demonstration of noble manners. Most of them look rustic, primitive and&#13;
uninteresting ... Many schools have stinky atmospheres, suffocating to&#13;
moderately clean people."&#13;
2/   In India, sanitary facilities for girls were reported in only one-half&#13;
the schools sampled in an evaluation of special programs for girls&#13;
education conducted by the Programme Evaluation Organization of the&#13;
Planning Commission.&#13;

Under these circumstances, even the most dedicated teacher could&#13;
not be faulted for failing to sustain a high level of motivation. Indeed&#13;
conscientious teachers are faced with difficult trade-offs between quantity&#13;
of throughput and quality of outcome for those who do persevere and attend&#13;
throughout the year. Those familiar with rural conditions indicate that&#13;
teachers readily discriminate among their students, concentrating attention&#13;
on those they deem most likely to succeed. Others are either directly&#13;
encouraged to drop-out, or leave as a result of sheer boredom. Given the&#13;
highly stratified nature of most South Asia villages, such selection proce-&#13;
dures are not likely to be made on a purely meritocratic basis: children of&#13;
larger landowners and other important community members are far more likely&#13;
to receive at least the minimum attention required to sustain interest. 1/&#13;
In spite of the operation of this discriminatory but perhaps inevit-&#13;
able selection process, the evidence seems to indicate that the sacrifice of&#13;
quantity has not resulted in acceptable levels of quality. Evidence on the&#13;
latter has been provided by the International Assessment of Education Achieve-&#13;
ment. 2/ At the end of the primary period Indian children learned on average&#13;
only 50% as much science and 48% as much native language reading as children&#13;
in Europe, Japan or the USA. The median score in 15 countries on reading&#13;
comprehension was 26 with India's score of 5 ranking lowest. Given the&#13;
sharply pyramidal structure of education in India in both enrollment and,&#13;
inversely in expenditure, one might expect this gap to narrow after secondary&#13;
school. Just the opposite occurs: by the upper secondary level, Indian&#13;
students have apparently learned only 28% as much science and only 14% as&#13;
much in reading comprehension. While there may be numerous problems with&#13;
cross country comparability, these results must cast serious doubt on the&#13;
advisability of simply expanding the present educational systems in South&#13;
Asia without thorough going efforts to implement improved curricula.&#13;
While this discussion of "internal" efficiency has drawn on evidence&#13;
primarily from the education sector, other human resource sectors suffer from&#13;
quite similar problems. If anything, problems in the health and nutrition&#13;
sectors are even more severe in terms of the inappropriateness of services&#13;
available and reaching those most in need. Some of the problems which persist&#13;
despite plans and programs to the contrary are indicated in an interim evalua-&#13;
tion of India's Integrated Child Development Services program where it was&#13;
found more difficult to organize and implement health and nutrition services&#13;
for preschool children than to provide the educational inputs. One of the&#13;
main reasons relates to the (again, understandable) lack of motivation on the&#13;
part of health personnel to seek out the population at greatest risk. Lack&#13;
of critical equipment to identify and monitor the progress of such groups&#13;
1/   Girls also appear to be losers in this process as they suffer relatively&#13;
higher drop-out rates at all levels through primary school. This is not&#13;
the case in secondary school, but those girls surviving that far can&#13;
already be presumed to be relatively advantaged or exceptionally&#13;
determined.&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
undoubtedly contributes to this situation. 1/ The general pattern in both&#13;
health and education appears to be poor motivation among the staff who are&#13;
responsible for the delivery of these services compounded by a severe lack&#13;
of complementary inputs and inadequate infrastructure.&#13;
Programs and Policy Alternatives for Human Resource Development&#13;
This section deals primarily with the situation in India and&#13;
Bangladesh. The policy dilemmas in these countries are quite analogous to&#13;
those in Nepal and Pakistan; however the latter two countries are either&#13;
currently facing, or have recently emerged from, a period of some political&#13;
uncertainty, which renders analysis of their current plans somewhat more&#13;
speculative.&#13;
Both in India and Bangladesh human resource development programs&#13;
are being considered in the context of five year development plans. A revised&#13;
version of India's Draft Plan, 1978-83, has been prepared but will not be&#13;
approved until the Planning Commission is reconstituted following the change&#13;
of government in January, 1980. However, few changes have been made in those&#13;
chapters dealing with human resources. 2/ The Goverment of Bangladesh is in&#13;
the process of preparing a new five-year plan which will likely set certain&#13;
objectives in human resource development in education, and in a more limited&#13;
way, health, which - though unlikely to be achieved in the plan period - will&#13;
provide a direction and standard for judging financial and administrative&#13;
commitment.&#13;
The universalization of primary education is given prominence in&#13;
both the Indian and Bangladesh planning exercises. In India the objective&#13;
appears in the context of a revised Minimum Needs program which sets the&#13;
objective that all children between the ages of 6 and 14 should be in schools&#13;
by 1988. On the basis of class size norms approaching 50 the Planning Com-&#13;
mission hopes to meet half the estimated increment of 72 million places&#13;

on the State of Preparedness of the Integrated Child Development Services&#13;
Projects," New Delhi 1978.&#13;
2/   These form separate chapters in the case of education, health and family&#13;
welfare, and social welfare (including nutrition). Programs in these&#13;
and other sectors are also dealt with in the chapter on Minimum Needs.&#13;
The primary change in India's current revised plan was the inclusion of&#13;
a strategy section for each minimum needs component. Unfortunately,&#13;
these sections have not yet been made publicly available. Once the&#13;
new government is in place and settled, further revisions to the plan&#13;
will undoubtedly be undertaken, necessitated by the deteriorating&#13;
economic conditions of the past year. However, the Planning Commission,&#13;
and the new Congress government, is likely to maintain a strong emphasis&#13;
on the Minimum Needs Program.&#13;
&#13;

through the formal system which would involve accommodating 18 million new&#13;
entrants in existing classes and the creation of approximately 350,000 new&#13;
classes. The per pupil expenditure implied in this exercise is approximately&#13;
$17.5 in the formal system and half that in the non-formal system. Thus the&#13;
total incremental cost of universalization on the basis of Indi .'s current&#13;
plans could be as great as $3.7 billion (in 1978 prices) over the entire 10&#13;
year implementation period. This implies a virtual doubling of current (1978)&#13;
levels of plan expenditure on education, which though feasible, would require&#13;
difficult decisions concerning reallocation from other sectors (assuming&#13;
overall plan resources to be fixed). Although similar (and perhaps misleading)&#13;
precision is not yet possible in evaluating Bangladesh's objectives (pending&#13;
the completion of the plan), the enrollment and dropout situation is such that&#13;
despite excess capacity at some levels, the relative financial impact is likely&#13;
to be even greater. 1/&#13;
In rural health, India's plans are at a somewhat more advanced stage&#13;
but similar approaches have been put forward in both Bangladesh and Pakistan.&#13;
Under India's revised minimum needs program a norm of one primary health center&#13;
per 50 thousand population with 10 associated sub-centers (1 per 5,000 popula-&#13;
tion) has been put forward. By 1988 these goals would require the construc-&#13;
tion and staffing of 6,241 primary health centers. On the order of 40,000&#13;
sub-centers would be required by 1988. In addition the plan proposes upgrading&#13;
2,400 primary health centers to become rural hospitals. Although the major&#13;
implementation of these goals is planned for the 1983-88 period (ranging from.&#13;
83% of rural hospitals to virtually all new primary health centers), the cost&#13;
of the 1978-83 program was estimated at almost $600 million. On this basis,&#13;
the total cost could go as high as $6-10 billion (in 1978 prices). Again,&#13;
relative costs in other South Asia countries desiring to achieve similar service&#13;
levels are not likely to be much lower.&#13;
Of course, cost projections such as these can be misleading when&#13;
there exists, as there does in South Asia, considerable scope for more effi-&#13;
cient resource management within the sectors. But the ease with which sectoral&#13;
reorganization can be undertaken should not be overestimated. Establishing&#13;
effective control over the provision of services is an extremely difficult&#13;
and time-consuming task, even when objectives are well-defined and accepted.&#13;
The sort of political difficulties which make reallocation from one sector to&#13;
another very problematic are just as likely to plague intra-sectoral reorgani-&#13;
zation efforts. In this context there has recently been considerable attention&#13;
devoted in South Asian countries, particularly India, to finding new, inexpen-&#13;
sive, decentralized approaches to problems of poverty and human resource devel-&#13;
opment. Such approaches are intended to complement and in some instances&#13;
substitute for the expansion of traditional services as outlined above. Before&#13;
reviewing a few of the most promising programs, mention should be made of two&#13;
1/   For reasons apparent from the discussions above progress is also likely&#13;
to be quite slow unless some additional resources are committed to re-&#13;
vamp existing but inadequate physical facilities. In addition, poor&#13;
teacher training, non-supportive, in some cases, virtually non-existent&#13;
supervision, irrelevant curricula, and inappropriate promotional criteria&#13;
for students and teachers all contribute to implementation problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
general points concerning policies affecting human resource development in&#13;
South Asia.&#13;
The first concerns one of the most frequently stressed points by&#13;
those in and out of government in South Asia, which is the crucial importance&#13;
of community participation/involvement. One could interpret this as a reali-&#13;
zation of the key role of demand. If villagers become aware of the services&#13;
that should/could be available to them, they can play a major role in determin-&#13;
ing the success of appropriate government programs. In contrast government&#13;
programs are generally dominated by supply considerations - the construction&#13;
of physical infrastructure, the (re)organization of government personnel, in&#13;
general, the delivery of services. In many sectors, this orientation of&#13;
government to the supply side is less critical. Industry and agriculture are,&#13;
ultimately, market-oriented activities which provide at least some feedback to&#13;
the users of government services. 1/ (In other sectors, e.g. defense, govern-&#13;
ment itself is the consumer). But few human resource development programs, no&#13;
matter how well-conceived, can raise public welfare without being utilized by&#13;
the intended recipients, that is, without there being expressed demand. 2/&#13;
Of course, the key role of community involvement is in no way a novel&#13;
observation. It underlay the formation of panchayati raj and the community&#13;
development movement in India and, more recently, gave impetus to the emphasis&#13;
on "block-level" planning in the context of the sixth five-year plan. But&#13;
with some notable exceptions, few policy interventions have been successful&#13;
in generating effective local demand. The observation is often made in South&#13;
Asia that the linkages among various aspects of human resource development are&#13;
sufficiently great so that one successful program could have possible spin-&#13;
offs in several directions, if the administrative capacity were there to meet&#13;
nascent demands. For example, the inauguration of village water supply often&#13;
frees girls and women from an onerous and time consuming task. This measure&#13;
alone can open the possibility for increased school attendance, for higher&#13;
standards of personal hygiene and improved environmental sanitation. Adult&#13;
education programs can have considerable impact on school attendance partic-&#13;
ularly through the effect of increased adult literacy among women on the&#13;
1/   The term "market-oriented" could of course include a whole range of&#13;
organizational alternatives, but in every case imbalances are registered&#13;
with reasonably appropriate signals of one form or another.&#13;
2/   There are exceptions:   the malaria-eradication program in India is a&#13;
notable example of a successful supply-dominated activity which signi-&#13;
ficantly improved the health status and productivity of Indians in all&#13;
socio-economic strata. The relatively loose connection between socio-&#13;
economic status and mosquitoe bites as well as the primarily technolo-&#13;
gical nature of vector control contributed to this success. However,&#13;
even here "success" may have proved illusory in that subsequent retrain-&#13;
ing and reassignment of malaria control personnel has been associated&#13;
with a resurgence of the disease. Without community "demand", there&#13;
seems to be little permanent effect of policy interventions with the&#13;
result that maintaining an effective service becomes a continuing and&#13;
large drain on manpower and fiscal resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
school enrollment of girls. However, it is unfortunately clear that no single&#13;
program is going to promote these linkages universally across South Asia. The&#13;
physical and socio-economic environment varies so greatly that decentralization&#13;
becomes imperatve. It would appear that a successful strategy of human&#13;
resource development must focus on identifying and delivering a very limited&#13;
number of servIces well and must begin by generating or meeting the demand for&#13;
those services than can be delivered. 1/&#13;
The second general issue which has been repeatedly stressed in this&#13;
analysis and which is also an important aspect of the community participation&#13;
problem is the involvement of women in human resource development programs.&#13;
It is a striking fact that women and girls constitute a vastly disproportion-&#13;
ate share of those who must be reached if primary school enrollment is to be&#13;
raised, if infant and child mortality is to be brought down, if adult literacy&#13;
is to be spread, and if the productivity of landless laborers and other espe-&#13;
cially disadvantaged groups is to be raised. Here again, the recognition&#13;
of the problem is banal; it is rather its complexity which is insufficiently&#13;
appreciated.&#13;
In rural areas of Pakistan, across northern and central India, to&#13;
Bangladesh, a large majority of young girls and even married women are inacces-&#13;
sible to even village based development programs. When girls are normally&#13;
withdrawn from school by age 8 or 9 and often remain in virtual seclusion&#13;
until they are married 4 or 5 years later, there is little headway to be&#13;
gained by pressing for expansion of the male-dominated primary school system&#13;
as it currently exists. Nor can one argue for the greater posting of women&#13;
teachers, which could charge the situation, given current conditions of rural&#13;
village life. There are similar and equally daunting problems in meeting the&#13;
health needs of young mothers and children which, by all accounts, constitute&#13;
the sub-continent's single greatest health problem. Although village health&#13;
workers or volunteers can make an impact in the delivery of many needcd&#13;
services, they are quite unlikely, as the programs are currently conceived in&#13;
India or Bangladesh, to improve maternal and child health. 2/ As with community&#13;
participation in general, no clear uniform courses of action to overcome these&#13;
problems can be recommended. Strategies must vary with local (district or&#13;
l/   For example, the reorientation of health services away from curative,&#13;
symptomatic treatment toward a preventive and epidemiological focus is&#13;
going to be continually frustrated in South Asia until the health demands&#13;
of villagers are met in a way which can both provide for symptomatic&#13;
treatment and create a demand for preventive (including, of course,&#13;
nutrition and MCH) and epidemiological measures.&#13;
2/   There are two main reasons for this pessimistic view:    (i) the training&#13;
of community health volunteers has virtually no input on MCH and nutri-&#13;
tion and (ii) CHV's are 98% men. In principle, both these factors are&#13;
remediable, but in practice there are significant administrative, and&#13;
social factors which underlie the current situation and inhibit rapid&#13;
change.&#13;

state) circumstances. The one thing that can be argued is that fitting&#13;
strategies to circumstances will itself require a much greater devolution&#13;
of responsibilities and resources.&#13;
Recognizing this need for a more decentralized approach, the Gov-&#13;
ernment of India has in the past few years initiated several new programs&#13;
which are intended to become major instruments for human resource development.&#13;
Most notable among them are the following:&#13;
(a) Community Health Volunteers Scheme - approximately 100,000&#13;
volunteers have been "trained" of whom virtually all are&#13;
male. The program appears to have high community accept-&#13;
ability and is well suited to certain-tasks such as chlori-&#13;
nation of wells in addition to basic symptomatic treatment.&#13;
However, major weaknesses remain in training, follow-up&#13;
support, and basic orientation of volunteers. The program is&#13;
still dependent on strength of local institutions (effective&#13;
village panchayats), but its potential should be rated high,&#13;
particularly if women can eventually be involved as&#13;
"co-volunteers" so that important groups at risk, mothers&#13;
and young children, can be reached.&#13;
(b) National Adult Education Program - coverage has been extended&#13;
to approximately 100,000 villages involving nearly 30 million&#13;
participants. Literacy programs are self-targeting in that&#13;
illiterates who will attend such centers are almost all from&#13;
groups which are socio-economically disadvantaged. The program&#13;
has made greater progress than CHV's in reaching women, but&#13;
training of volunteer instructors is currently very weak,&#13;
resulting in low efficiency as many participants quickly&#13;
lose unreinforced skills. Program potential is high if not&#13;
co-opted or otherwise undermined by village elites. One of&#13;
the major benefits of a successful adult literacy program&#13;
would be an increased demand for primary education for&#13;
children of newly literate adults. This could lead to&#13;
greater community involvement and support to the education&#13;
system.&#13;
(c) Antyodaha - although only indirectly related to human resource&#13;
sectors as education and health, this community oriented&#13;
poverty alleviation program aims at identifying succes-&#13;
sive waves of the five poorest families in each village and&#13;
bringing them up to the minimum income level. This program&#13;
is one of the most innovative and potentially far-reaching&#13;
efforts at making development programs serve the needs of&#13;
poor; however, it depends on strong political leadership to&#13;
win community support and promote consensus. Follow-up&#13;
measures to help families utilize new assets have been&#13;
identified as seriously weak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
(d) Finally, it should be noted that undoubtedly the largest&#13;
and most significant adult education program in India is&#13;
the training and visit system in agricultural extension.&#13;
This program has brought to approximately 30 million Indian&#13;
farmers 'the most recent field techniques available for in-&#13;
corporating relevant agricultural research. This "on-the-&#13;
job training program" in agriculture has had direct and&#13;
highly significant effects on agricultural productivity&#13;
for small as well as large farmers.&#13;
Future Policy Options. Even if planners in South Asia were con-&#13;
vinced that a greater share of public investment resources in South Asia&#13;
should be devoted to human resource development, it seems quite clear that&#13;
plans for expansion based on current, traditional programs in health and&#13;
education would gobble up such funds with little chance that appropriate&#13;
improvements in services and outcomes would materialize for those who are&#13;
especially disadvantaged: women, the landless, others of particularly low&#13;
economic or social status in rural areas. One approach does seem to lie&#13;
in programs such as those discussed briefly above which attempt to create a&#13;
sense of community participation and responsibility for health and education&#13;
outcomes. These programs are relatively low cost; but they will, as the&#13;
uneven progress with the training and visit system in agricultural extension&#13;
has demonstrated, encounter obstacles other than finance as they confront&#13;
varying local circumstances. The degree of administrative commitment required&#13;
to overcome these must exceed that of normal programs while actual program&#13;
size and "clout" will be a fraction of the bureaucratic establishment.&#13;
Nevertheless, as the rapid initial progress with community health volunteers,&#13;
adult education, and to a lesser degree, the Antyodaha scheme, and the con-&#13;
tinued success of the training and visit system demonstrate, human resource&#13;
development schemes which are sensitive to community needs receive widespread&#13;
acceptance and support.&#13;
In terms of overall development strategy human resource development&#13;
must be considered in the context of competing investment priorities. Given&#13;
the levels of poverty and relatively slow growth performance of the South&#13;
Asia region, high priority must be given to increasing the rate of growth in&#13;
the agricultural sector which provides the livelihood for around two-thirds&#13;
of the region's population. But it is also clear that even rapidly growing&#13;
agriculture will not provide jobs for the increment which will augment the&#13;
labor force in the next twenty years (consisting largely of individuals already&#13;
born). Consequently, policies and investment which will encourage a more&#13;
rapid industrial transformation of the region's economy are crucial. These&#13;
will primarily involve public investments in infrastructure and key industries&#13;
as well as appropriate industrial policies to encourage the private sector&#13;
(assuming that the current mixed economy framework is maintained). An impor-&#13;
tant aspect of this infrastructure is the stock of human capital. There would&#13;
appear to be considerable scope for improving the efficiency of investments&#13;
in the human resource sectors of education and health which, although not&#13;
necessarily easy to implement, should be fully exploited before evaluating&#13;
whether large shifts in public investment priorities should be undertaken.&#13;
But before that point can be reached, marginal adjustments in priorities may&#13;
be required because, first, more resources may be necessary to facilitate the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
intra-sectoral improvements in efficiency that are advocated here and second,&#13;
there is evidence that investments in basic education have yielded average&#13;
returns greater than the cost of capital while having numerous desirable&#13;
spin-offs affecting fertility, health, and general modernization. There is&#13;
a presumptior too that improvements in health status can have direct produc-&#13;
tivity effects given the serious incidence of morbidity even among those of&#13;
working age and these benefits again combined with effects on fertility would&#13;
yield quite significant returns if they could be appropriately valued.&#13;
Governments, however, also have distributional objectives, and&#13;
these are particularly'prominent in South Asia with its predominance of the&#13;
world's poor. As it is clear that individuals readily choose better health&#13;
status and more education as income levels rise, governments in South Asia&#13;
have expressed objectives of providing services adequate to enable all the&#13;
population to attain minimum levels of-educational and health status. Al-&#13;
though distributional objectives may be paramount there is also the realization&#13;
that substantial numbers of the poor have few resources beyond their own labor&#13;
which can be directly augmented. With limited employment prospects for un-&#13;
skilled labor, human resource development can potentially play an important&#13;
redistributive role which would also serve to raise its social rate of return&#13;
as a productive investment. While expenditures on some programs such as basic&#13;
education or literacy are self-targetting in this respect, other programs,&#13;
particularly in the health sector will likely require administrative reorgan-&#13;
ization and strict monitoring if they are to serve this dual function of&#13;
redistribution and investment. The danger of program co-opting by traditional&#13;
elites, which remain a potent force in rural South Asia, and by urban middle-&#13;
classes requires careful evaluation of wholesale expansion with a presumption&#13;
that a selective approach to human resource development programs can lead to&#13;
both the more productive utilization of manpower which is the crux of develop-&#13;
ment and to an acceptable minimum standards of nutrition, health and education&#13;
for the half billion poor of South Asia.&#13;

A. Income Levels and Poverty&#13;
In 1977, the 215 million or so inhabitants of the Middle East and&#13;
North Africa (MENA) had per capita incomes on average of $1,332 in prices of&#13;
that year. The presence within the group of some oil-producing countries with&#13;
incomes in excess of $6,000 leads to a considerable overstatement of this&#13;
average however. If one excludes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya, the average&#13;
in 1977 falls to $1,009 per capita. Of the 16 countries in the region with&#13;
populations of more than 1 million, only one falls into the WDR classification&#13;
of low income (Afghanistan), while the 12 other countries in the group, i.e.&#13;
excluding the three oil exporters cited above, are all middle income. The&#13;
range of income levels within the countries of the MENA region can be seen&#13;
more clearly from the following classification: First, the low income MENA&#13;
with incomes from $190 to $600 per capita at 1977 prices (Afghanistan, Egypt,&#13;
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Yemen Arab Republic and Morocco);&#13;
second, middle income MENA with a range from $600 to $1,200 per capita (Jordan,&#13;
Tunisia, Syria, Algeria, Turkey and Lebanon); third, high income MENA (Iraq at&#13;
$1,550 per capita and Iran at $2,160).&#13;
The decade of the seventies has been a good one for most of the&#13;
countries of the MENA region. In the period between 1968 and 1973 the high&#13;
rates of growth in Northern Europe provided a market for large exports of&#13;
labor and agricultural products from Turkey, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.&#13;
Since end-1973 the oil receipts which have flowed into the region have spilled&#13;
over into a large number of non-oil producing countries as well. Large&#13;
numbers of workers have gone from Egypt, the YAR, PDRY, Jordan, Syria and&#13;
Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, Libya and Iran. The remit-&#13;
tances of these workers have become a major source of foreign exchange earn-&#13;
ings for the sending countries. In addition there have been direct transfers&#13;
of both official and private capital mainly from Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states&#13;
and Libya to Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Morocco and the YAR. During the sixties,&#13;
growth in the region was 5 percent per annum, during the seventies it has&#13;
spurted to 7 percent. Looked at on a per capita basis this is even more&#13;
impressive since it means that, during the seventies, annual growth of per&#13;
capita income has been almost double the level of the previous decade.&#13;
The benefits of the rapid rise in regional income are perhaps&#13;
less apparent for the poor of the region, or at least for those poor who are&#13;
unable or unwilling to migrate. In the absence of specific government programs,&#13;
higher income for the poorest groups depends primarily on the emergence of&#13;
labor scarcities and the consequent bidding up of rural wage rates. This has&#13;
indeed happened in some countries, most notably the YAR. 1/ It is a moot&#13;
1/   One might theorize that a limit will be reached when rural wage rates&#13;
become competitive with the returns from small-holder farming by tradi-&#13;
tional methods at which point there would be an enormous increase in the&#13;
labor supply in these countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
point whether the rise in money wages has in all cases been sufficient to&#13;
outweigh the rise in prices of those products which are in demand in the high&#13;
income areas. Demand from Iran for example, has led to sharp price rises for&#13;
agricultural produce in border areas of Afghanistan. Although wage levels in&#13;
these areas have risen as well it is not clear that the very poorest groups&#13;
are better off. Worker remittances and high domestic growth rates may result&#13;
in an increase in the relative prices of those food items which are highly&#13;
income-elastic, and leave individual families worse off rather than better&#13;
off.&#13;
The question of how the relative and absolute incomes of the poor&#13;
change over time as the economy grows has not been much addressed in the MENA&#13;
countries, perhaps because of the scarcity of data for individual countries&#13;
over a significant period of time. One might take a cross-section of&#13;
countries at different income levels as a proxy for a single country time&#13;
series. In Afghanistan, the absolute poverty cut-off in 1977 for rural&#13;
areas was $85, in Egypt $150, in Morocco $200, and in Turkey it was estimated&#13;
at about $230, per capita. 1/ It is not clear to what extent this reflects&#13;
relative price differences and to what extent it simply reflects inadequate&#13;
data and different assumptions made by those who have done the calculations.&#13;
Since the ratio of income between Afghanistan, Egypt and Morocco is not very&#13;
different from the ratio of the poverty cut off point, this suggests that the&#13;
real cost of the bundle of goods which the poor consume rises with per capita&#13;
income growth up to a point where the income elasticity of the products&#13;
consumed by the poor begins to decline. A country might therefore need to get&#13;
rather far up the income scale before growth without any change in income&#13;
distribution has an impact on the living standards of the poor. It would be&#13;
interesting to review a much larger sample to see how robust this interpre-&#13;
tation might be.&#13;
How many absolute poor are there in the MENA countries? This has&#13;
indeed been one of the most difficult areas of judgement. I have attempted&#13;
to get a qualitative and/or quantitative assessment from those who are familiar&#13;
with individual countries, but in many cases the paucity of data reduces&#13;
the exercise to informed arbitrariness. I offer the following numbers only as&#13;
rough estimates providing a starting point for future refinement and investiga-&#13;
tion.&#13;
1/   The definition of poverty cut-off is the standard one used in the Bank;&#13;
the cost of providing minimum calorie requirements inflated by non-food&#13;
expenditures of the 20th percentile.&#13;

If figures were available for 1960 they would probably show a very impressive&#13;
decrease in percentage terms and judging what one knows of individual coun-&#13;
tries, a small decrease in absolute terms as well. In 1960 the region had a&#13;
total population of 137.3 million. If the same number were poor in that year&#13;
as in 1977, the proportion would have been about 35 percent. There have&#13;
probably been notable declines in the numbers of poor in the YAR, Jordan,&#13;
Tunisia, Syria, Algeria, Iraq and Iran. In the remaining countries in the&#13;
region the number of absolute poor has probably risen, but in all cases except&#13;
Afghanistan and PDRY, the percentage of the population which is poor has&#13;
almost certainly fallen. In Afghanistan the percentage of absolute poor in the&#13;
population has probably remained the same. PDRY is a rather special case since&#13;
the removal of substantial exogenous income from the port and military base in&#13;
Aden, may have resulted in an increase in both the percentage and numbers of&#13;
the absolute poor. The varying degrees of success achieved in reducing&#13;
poverty and their relation to the strategies pursued are the key to the study&#13;
at hand.&#13;
It is of course the relationship between the level of per capita&#13;
income in a country and its distribution which determines the numbers of the&#13;
absolute poor. The bottom quintile in the MENA region receive between 3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
percent and 7 percent of total income in the countries of the region, i.e.&#13;
the average income of the bottom quintile is between 15 and 35 percent of the&#13;
national income per capita. In Afghanistan one would need an income which&#13;
is 45 percent of the national average in order to move out of the poverty&#13;
category. At Turkey's income level, about 20 percent of the national average&#13;
would be sufficient, however, in Turkey the bottom quintile receive only 17&#13;
percent of the national income per capita, so that the numbers of the absolute&#13;
poor in Turkey remain high. Tunisia which has a per capita income of $860&#13;
compared to Turkey's $1110, nevertheless has a smaller percentage of absolute&#13;
poor since the bottom quintile in Tunisia receives on average 25 percent of&#13;
the national per capita income or $215 as compared to $190 in Turkey.&#13;
Who are the 50 million or so poor in the MENA countries? The&#13;
broad characteristics differ little from other regions. In almost every&#13;
country where six or more people are dependent for their consumption needs&#13;
on the earnings of one major wage earner who derives his living from unskilled&#13;
labor in the agricultural, construction or urban informal sector 1/, the chances&#13;
are that the family will be part of the absolute poor, unless they are assisted&#13;
by other members of the extended family. Similarly those who own farms less&#13;
than a ratio of land to family members which differs from one situation to&#13;
another, will be poor. 2/ A similar relationship could be derived from the&#13;
ratio of the turnover of petty traders to family size. In addition there are&#13;
certain poverty problems which are almost structural in nature, such as some&#13;
groups among the Palestinian refugees and those displaced by the war in&#13;
Lebanon who remain in camps, various relatively isolated tribal groups and&#13;
large proportions of the nomadic population.&#13;
There are some grounds for thinking that movement both in and out of&#13;
the absolute poverty category may be greater than in other regions. Years of&#13;
drought are a factor in MENA (as they are also in Africa, but less in East&#13;
Asia and Latin America). These are particularly serious for the many in&#13;
the region who depend on livestock. Herds are often decimated through the&#13;
destruction of natural vegetation in years of drought. Small farmers as in&#13;
other regions may have to borrow at high interest rates to tide themselves&#13;
over such periods and there will be less work for the landless. As against&#13;
this traditions in the MENA countries place considerable responsibility&#13;
on the rich to help poor relatives and others during such periods. The life&#13;
cycle of the family is also a factor. Older children until marriage contribute&#13;
to the family's total income so that a family with a few wage earners will be&#13;
better off at least for a period of time. The marriage itself however may be&#13;
a source of impoverishment through large dowries paid from borrowed funds.&#13;
1/   The urban informal sector ranges in Cairo for example from the artisan&#13;
to the pickpocket, but does not include those unemployed who can afford&#13;
to wait for a suitable job to come their way.&#13;
2/   In Afghanistan for example a family of six needs for subsistence 21&#13;
hectares of dry land, or from one to five hectares of irrigated land&#13;
depending on cropping patterns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
A composite picture of a poor MENA family might look like this.&#13;
Mansur the head of the family is about thirty-seven years old, his wife&#13;
Waheeda about nine years younger. They have been married for thirteen years&#13;
sr.d have five curviving children out of seven. Mansur's mother and one&#13;
divorced sister live with them. Neither Mansur nor his wife went to school.&#13;
The eldest boy attended the government school in a village two kilometers away&#13;
for three years but has not gone back since he has begun to earn some income&#13;
tending a richer neighbor's sheep.   Mansur is a laborer and has no land.&#13;
Meals for the family are mainly wheat bread with beans cooked in' oil or some&#13;
onions, yogurt, and tea with sugar. In the season there may be melons and on&#13;
special occasions some mutton for dinner. The house has two or three small&#13;
rooms and the family cooks inside in the winter for warmth and outside in the&#13;
summer. There is no furniture in the house just an old carpet which is&#13;
practically worn through.   There is a large town ten miles away and a direct&#13;
bus and Mansur has occasionally found some casual employment there during the&#13;
off-season. He has heard talk in the village that there are jobs in other&#13;
countries and the unmarried brother of one of the farmers who employs him&#13;
during the harvest season went away and returned with enough money to begin&#13;
the construction of a new house. But Mansur cannot leave. His two brothers&#13;
are also farm workers and cannot support his family as well as their own. In&#13;
any case how would he raise the money for the trip and for the payments which&#13;
'he has been told he will have to make to the border officials along the way.&#13;
There is little question that poverty in the MENA region is' concen-&#13;
'trated in the rural areas. Roughly 44 percent of the region's population&#13;
is defined as urban (93.3 million). The evidence is that only about 20&#13;
percent of the region's poor at the outside would be in urban areas.    The&#13;
urban poor seem to be concentrated in Egypt and to a lesser extent Turkey,&#13;
Algeria and Morocco. The main reason for lower urban poverty is that the&#13;
major increases in national product are accruing in these areas at a rate&#13;
which is greater than migration into these areas, and the relatively efficient&#13;
functioning of the urban labor market allows increased income to be translated&#13;
into new employment opportunities. Of course higher urban incomes than rural&#13;
(e.g. in Egypt median urban incomes are 40 percent above median rural incomes)&#13;
may be compensated by higher urban costs, particularly food. It is the policy&#13;
of many governments in the region however to provide substantial subsidies for&#13;
food. These subsidies often make the cost of food in urban areas not very&#13;
different from the ex farm prices that small farmers in the rural areas would&#13;
be able to get i.e. the government absorbs the middlemen's costs and margins.&#13;
Since it is these margins which typically make it necessary to earn a much&#13;
higher wage in urban than in the rural areas to achieve the same standard of&#13;
living, the differentials may be somewhat lower in this region than in other&#13;
parts of the world.&#13;
The rural poor appear to be regionally concentrated to a surprising&#13;
extent. Often they are in the more remote areas where land distribution is&#13;
uneven and/or less land is irrigaterd. Eastern Anatolia in Turkey, the South of&#13;
Tunisia, Upper Egypt, are all well known examples of poverty concentrations.&#13;
The plight of landless laborers in these areas is particularly distressing.&#13;
Agricultural wages tend to be low. Labor markets are fragmented in rural&#13;
areas and there is little information on where excess demand for workers is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
located. In Morocco one of the main causes of low productivity of landless&#13;
laborers was found to be the distance and time between places of employment&#13;
combined with this lack of information. In addition subsidized foodstuffs&#13;
often do not reach them. Egypt is an example of a country where rural&#13;
workers probably pay more for some basic food items than urban workers.&#13;
On balance then, while poverty in the MENA region is probably dimin-&#13;
ishing relative to population, there can be little cause for complacency.&#13;
Poverty remains a significant problem affecting one out of every five people&#13;
in the region. In addition, as we will see later, for any given level of&#13;
disposable income, the health and educational status of the population of the&#13;
MENA countries is probably somewhat lower than in similar countries in Latin&#13;
America or Asia.&#13;
B. Demography and Poverty&#13;
Population growth in the MENA region has averaged 2.6 percent per&#13;
annum between 1960 and 1977. These rates are high historically for the region&#13;
and comparable to those in the middle income ldcs in Africa and Latin America.&#13;
By the end of this century, the population in the region will have risen from&#13;
213.6'million in 1977 to something of the order of 364 million. While the&#13;
projections assume a lowering of the percentage increase over the past, the&#13;
number of additional people is the factor which creates concern. Whereas in&#13;
the past twenty years something of the order of 85 million people were added&#13;
to the region's population, the next twenty years will see the addition of&#13;
about 145 million. It is going to be very difficult to tackle the absolute&#13;
poverty problem in that kind of situation.&#13;
In every country in the region, the percentage fall in the birth&#13;
rate from 1960 to 1977 was less than that of the death rate. Only in three&#13;
countries was the absolute fall greater in the case of birth rates than death&#13;
rates: Turkey, Tunisia and Lebanon. In seven countries there was virtually&#13;
no decline in birth rates between 1960 and 1977: Afghanistan, PDRY, YAR,&#13;
Jordan, Syria, Algeria and Iraq. 1/ Of nine countries in the world with total&#13;
fertility rates still above 7.0 in 1977, no less than six of them are in the&#13;
MENA region: PDRY, YAR, Jordan, Syria, Algeria and Iraq.&#13;
There is one element that could make the picture even worse. The&#13;
region lags badly in the sphere of infant mortality. Infant mortality rates&#13;
are over 100 per 1000 births in four of the most populous countries in the&#13;
region: Turkey, Egypt, Morocco and Iran. It is in large part for this reason&#13;
that life expectancy at birth in the region still lags considerably behind&#13;
other middle income ldcs. It is above 60 years only in Turkey, Lebanon and&#13;
Kuwait; and below 50 years in Afghanistan, PDRY, YAR and Saudi Arabia. Infant&#13;
1/   Demographic data in the cases of Afghanistan, PDRY and YAR are so weak&#13;
that the conclusions should be regarded as tentative in these cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
mortality can and should be substantially reduced in these countries and if it&#13;
is then there might well be a spurt in population growth, though it could&#13;
reasonably be argued that the sorts of factors which will lead to lower infant&#13;
mortality are also those which lead in turn to lower birth rates (better edu-&#13;
cation of women and access to health facilities).&#13;
How do high rates of population growth impact on poverty in the&#13;
region? First there is the very obvious link between population and social&#13;
services. Even with rather high proportions of government expenditure on&#13;
health and education in the countries of the region, governments are far from&#13;
achieving full coverage of the population - Tunisia and Morocco are good&#13;
examples. High rates of population growth simply delay the achievement of&#13;
full coverage and since by and large the poor are at the bottom of the waiting&#13;
list for facilities the delay will be greatest in their case. Substantial&#13;
government subsidies for health and education services, which in almost every&#13;
MENA country benefit the better-off disproportionately, compound the cost of&#13;
expanded coverage in the context of rapid population growth. Another factor&#13;
is the employment problem. Large annual additions to the labor force are very&#13;
difficult for most of these countries to absorb into their modern sectors&#13;
which begin from a rather limited base. There is a fair amount of unemployment&#13;
in countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia and Iran and decided slack in&#13;
Morocco and Algeria, if somewhat less open unemployment. This is an increas-&#13;
ingly serious problem for the countries in the region especially when it is&#13;
remembered that female participation rates in the MENA countries are expanding&#13;
very rapidly from an extremely low base. One calculation in Algeria suggested&#13;
that a 9 percent GDP growth rate would be required until the year 2000 to&#13;
create employment for all the additions to the labor force if present trends&#13;
continue. This problem may become explosive in the MENA region if and when&#13;
the oil-producing countries can no longer absorb the additions to the labor&#13;
force and must even begin to repatriate existing workers as has happened in&#13;
Northern Europe already.&#13;
But the costs of rapid population growth are not only apparent at&#13;
the macro-level. Within the family as well there are serious implications.&#13;
One very clear instance is the evidence of malnutrition in children between&#13;
one and five years of age. The children are transferred to an unsuitable diet&#13;
too soon, since the mother must begin to feed the new addition to the family.&#13;
Better spacing of births would improve this situation. The ability of parents&#13;
to select appropriate points in their lives for having children can lead to an&#13;
immense improvement in the quality of life, which is only incidentally related&#13;
to the question of the eventual size of the family. By choosing to delay&#13;
births at certain points, they may be able to improve the family's long-term&#13;
economic viability and the education and nutrition of individual children, to&#13;
a considerable extent.&#13;
The governments of the region seem to be increasingly aware of the&#13;
importance of mounting effective population control programs. The most&#13;
impressive performance in this field is that of Tunisia where the achievements&#13;
have been striking. Egypt is also a positive example, though the commitment&#13;
of the government to the programs has been questioned at times in the past.&#13;
In Turkey, population growth declined substantially despite the lack of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -&#13;
enthusiasm of the government. The latest convert to the importance of popula-&#13;
tion planning is Morocco. Attitudes in other countries have been quite mixed.&#13;
The size of a country's population has sometimes been confused by leaders of&#13;
the MENA countries as being synonomous with its power and world-standing.&#13;
O~' vra  however there does seem to be a trend of growing awareness of the&#13;
strains which population growth might impose on these societies. And the&#13;
potential impact of programs is much more significant than is sometimes&#13;
realized. Tunisia, with considerable population pressure on arable land&#13;
resources began a program in the early sixties when its population was&#13;
about 4.5 million. By the year 2000 its population will have grown to 9&#13;
million. But if its population had grown since 1960 at the same rate as&#13;
Algeria, it would have had 14 million people in the year 2000. Similarly&#13;
Turkey would have had 91 million people instead of the 64 million which is now&#13;
projected, and, perhaps most terrifying of all, Egypt would have had 86&#13;
million instead of the 58 million now projected. These reductions are of&#13;
course only in part of consequence of official population control programs,&#13;
but the Tunisia case clearly shows how much impact government efforts in a&#13;
variety of areas related to improved educational and employment status of&#13;
women as well as family planning itself, can have.&#13;
C. Nutrition and Poverty&#13;
One of the most important consequences of the foreign exchange&#13;
resources which have flowed through the region since late 1973 has been to&#13;
enable governments in the region to increase the import of food supplies.&#13;
Iran and the YAR provide good examples of this. Probably only Afghanistan&#13;
and perhaps PDRY now remain below 100 percent of the estimated average per&#13;
capita needs. 1/ In at least three countries in the region, food imports in&#13;
1976 were more than one-quarter of total imports: Egypt, YAR and Jordan while&#13;
in others particularly the oil-producing countries, food imports are a very&#13;
high proportion of total food consumption, though a lower proportion of total&#13;
imports. Only the South Asian countries have similar dependence on imported&#13;
food. In most of the remaining countries of the region, food imports were&#13;
between 10 and 20 percent of total imports in 1976, still a high proportion&#13;
by world standards. Only Turkey was significantly below this with a mere 3&#13;
percent of imports being food items.&#13;
The figures for total agricultural production in the MENA countries&#13;
are an adequate proxy for food production. Since 1970 agricultural growth has&#13;
been particularly disappointing in Morocco and Iraq where it has been virtually&#13;
stagnant. It has more or less kept pace with population growth in Afghanistan,&#13;
Egypt and Algeria and has slightly exceeded it in Turkey. It has substantially&#13;
exceeded population growth in YAR, Tunisia, Syria and Iran, although the&#13;
figures for the last-mentioned have been seriously questioned. It is difficult&#13;
to draw conclusions of any kind from this rather mixed pattern. I suspect&#13;
1/   World Development Indicators gives a figure of 88 percent for Algeria.&#13;
This is regarded as incomprehensible by those who know that country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -&#13;
that a conclusion that food production per capita remained constant in the&#13;
past decade, but that larger imports have increased food availability per&#13;
capita, despite a population increase of 2.6 percent per annum, would&#13;
be correct.&#13;
Has this increase in food reached the poor? The answer to that&#13;
question depends on the price at which food is sold relative to the incomes of&#13;
the poor. As far as the urban areas are concerned there is little doubt&#13;
that food is reaching those who need it. This is in part because in almost&#13;
every country in the region food prices are subsidized by governments. The&#13;
extremes are represented by Afghanistan where subsidies are limited to govern-&#13;
ment civil servants and Egypt where massive food subsidies on a large number&#13;
of food items account for about 5 percent of GNP and a sizeable share of&#13;
government current expenditures. Subsidies are also important in Algeria,&#13;
Morocco, Syria and of course all the major oil exporting cbuntries in the&#13;
region. A wide range of products are subsidized. The grain staple is sub-&#13;
sidized in every country. In most there are subsidies for cooking oils as&#13;
well. Other commodities which are frequently subsidized include tea, sugar,&#13;
kerosene, onions and some meat items. The package of food products is oriented&#13;
to the consumption of the urban consumer and by and large does assure him of&#13;
supply of a wide range of food items at a price within the reach of a modern&#13;
sector worker. The urban poor (the unemployed and informal sector workers)&#13;
would be able to get the staple at a price which is within their range. 1/&#13;
The subsidized commodities often do not reach the rural areas however.&#13;
This may be less important for the staple which is available at least after&#13;
the harvest at prices which may be competitive with subsidized prices in the&#13;
towns. But it is important for the other commodities and during the off-&#13;
season.&#13;
The other side of the coin of food subsidies are guaranteed prices&#13;
to farmers and heavy subsidies on inputs. In theory such an income transfer&#13;
to the rural areas should bid up the wage rate and enable the rural landless&#13;
to share in higher income as well as providing additional income to small, but&#13;
surplus farmers. In practice this has not been the case. The subsidies&#13;
benefit disproportionately the larger farmers who make use of these inputs.&#13;
In addition one of the most potent subsidies is the availability of cheap&#13;
credit which has led to a rash of mechanization in many countries of the&#13;
region. Turkey is a good example of this. This in turn reduces the demand&#13;
for unskilled labor on the farm.&#13;
The rural poor derive little or no direct benefits from massive gov-&#13;
ernment expenditures on subsidizing food and agricultural inputs in the MENA&#13;
countries. That these subsidies persist nevertheless is of course a function&#13;
1/   Though even in their case supply may be a problem.   The bakeries in&#13;
Egyptian cities are often sold out of subsidized bread within an hour&#13;
or two of opening in the morning. The rich can send their servants to&#13;
queue, but the poor may be at work during those hours.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
of the political weakness of the poor in the rural areas. The urban poor are&#13;
a far greater political risk and are often able to resort to popular action&#13;
to exert pressure on governments. The food riots in Egypt in 1977 which&#13;
succeeded in reversing a decision to reduce the level of subsidies provided&#13;
clear evidence of this. The political influence of large landowners in some&#13;
countries has been a major factor in the high level of agricultural subsidies.&#13;
Analysis done in one or two countries in the region shows that the rural poor&#13;
could be helped to a far greater extent by programs directed specifically at&#13;
rural development if moneys used for food subsidies could be channelled into&#13;
these programs. One of the approaches often suggested to reduce the budgetary&#13;
burden of food subsidies is to target them to the poor rather than to subsidize&#13;
indiscriminately. Unfortunately no country in the region has as yet been able&#13;
to overcome the political and administrative constraints to doing so.&#13;
School feeding is often a very effective means of overcoming nutri-&#13;
tional deficiencies of some of the most vulnerable groups. In countries where&#13;
enrolment is less than 100 percent of the age group, and this is true for most&#13;
of the countries of. the region, especially for girls, it is usually the&#13;
poorest that are not enrolled in schools, so that feeding schemes are not&#13;
always effective in helping them. However it is a program which has the dual&#13;
benefits of both overcoming some of the opportunity costs of primary education&#13;
to the poorest families, and also directly promoting the nutrition of children.&#13;
It therefore deserves consideration in rather more countries in the region&#13;
than at present. There are major administrative and financial constraints to&#13;
these programs of course, and they should not be entered into lightly without&#13;
adequate provision for staffing and recurrent costs. It would seem to be worth&#13;
some effort to see whether low-cost, easily administered programs can be&#13;
developed in this area. The efforts of Algeria, with its nationwide school&#13;
lunch program, merit closer study in this regard.&#13;
It was pointed out in the previous section that malnutrition is&#13;
not solely a consequence of overall lack of calories. In the cases of Eygpt,&#13;
Afghanistan and Morocco, it has been observed that when children are put on&#13;
an unsuitable diet after one year, because the arrival of a new baby means&#13;
that the mother stops breat-feeding the older child, there is serious malnutri-&#13;
tion in the child which only begins to reverse itself from age 3. 1/ It is&#13;
not clear whether there are longer term consequences of this deprivation&#13;
during childhood. This is a matter of post-natal and general education, as&#13;
well as family planning services. The prevalence of food and water-borne&#13;
parasites in areas where hygiene standards are low also means that the full&#13;
benefits of food consumption cannot be derived by the individual. The linkages&#13;
between nutrition and other basic needs have been particularly neglected in&#13;
the MENA countries. In Egypt, for example, where over one million pre-school&#13;
children suffer from chronic malnutrition (17 percent of the total), the&#13;
problem is greatly exacerbated by the fact that 30 percent of all children&#13;
suffer from communicable diseases at any given time and thus cannot derive the&#13;
full nutritional benefit from the food they consume. Once again these problems&#13;
are far more likely to face the poor in the region, than the better off.&#13;
1/   In Morocco the mother stops feeding as soon as she is aware that she&#13;
is pregnant again, since custom says that continued feeding will harm the&#13;
child in the womb.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
There is still a serious nutritional problem among the rural poor&#13;
in the MENA countries. This is not a question of famine and starvation except&#13;
perhaps in Afghanistan where, given the very undeveloped nature of the food&#13;
distribution system, starvation can become a reality in drought years as was&#13;
indeed the case in 1970 and 1971. In the other countries in the region&#13;
however, sufficient foreign exchange resources have more or less ensured that&#13;
famine has been consigned to history. But not malnutrition alas. The example&#13;
of Egypt where recent figures put the per capita per diem food availability at&#13;
3000 calories (the FAO minimum for Egypt is 2350), yet sizeable pockets of&#13;
malnutrition persist, is evidence of the fact that increased food availability&#13;
alone will not be enough to solve this stubborn problem. The linkages with&#13;
income distribution, health and education must be explored further.&#13;
D. Health and Poverty&#13;
If life expectancy at birth is an adequate proxy for health standards,&#13;
then the MENA countries have done extremely well in the period between 1960 and&#13;
1977. The weighted average life expectancy at birth has improved from 46 years&#13;
of age at the beginning of the period, to 55 years at the end. This compares&#13;
with an improvement for all middle-income countries from 53 to 60. As is&#13;
evident the MENA countries started from a lower base than the middle income&#13;
countries in Latin America and East Asia for example, but have in some cases&#13;
substantially reduced the deficit and in others at least maintained their&#13;
position. It is surprising how uniform their progress in the period has been.&#13;
Even in the worst case, Iran, life expectancy at birth rose from 46 years to&#13;
52 years, while in the best cases, the Yemens, it went up from 36 years to&#13;
47 years.&#13;
There is no great secret about why this improvement has taken place -&#13;
the elements have been well documented and relate to better nutrition and&#13;
education, control of epidemic diseases, increased access to safe water,&#13;
spread of medication and health facilities, better standards of hygiene, etc.&#13;
The WDR publishes figures which show population per physician and nursing&#13;
person in 1960 and 1977, and it is tempting to try to relate these to what is&#13;
happening to health in the countries of the region. The picture which emerges&#13;
from doing this is a confusing one however, as Table II indicates.&#13;
Table II: LIFE EXPECTANCY AND AVAILABILITY OF MEDICAL&#13;
PERSONNEL IN SELECTED MENA COUNTRIES IN 1977.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154 -&#13;
The figures certainly seem to suggest that the numbers of doctors and nurses&#13;
matter little to overall life expectancy. Of course there are all sorts of&#13;
possible explanations; the most obvious one is the lags which are inherent&#13;
bztween increasing the number of medical personnel and having an impact on&#13;
life expectancy. It could also be argued, convincingly I think, that the&#13;
quality of life is not taken into account adequately by the life expectancy&#13;
figure alone and that the role which medical personnel and facilities play in&#13;
reducing the pain and discomfort of ailments is equally significant.&#13;
One area where one would have expected the availability of medical&#13;
facilities to have had much more of an impact is infant mortality. As explain-&#13;
ed earlier, rates of infant mortality remain extremely high in some of the&#13;
larger countries of the region. Data reliability is an enormous problem in&#13;
this field and there must be some suspicion that better data would indicate&#13;
that the problem is more serious than the figures suggest in most countries&#13;
of the region.   For all those countries in the region where figures are quoted&#13;
in Bank sources, the estimates are very near to 100 deaths per 1,000 births or&#13;
even substantially above that - the figure rises to nearly 1 death in every 4&#13;
births in the case of Afghanistan and 1 in 6 in Morocco. The failure of even&#13;
a rather advanced country like Turkey to reduce its infant mortality rate&#13;
below 118 at the most recent estimate is extremely puzzling. 1/ Given the&#13;
urban/rural distribution of income and health facilities in Turkey, this&#13;
probably means that the infant mortality rate is something like one in five&#13;
among the rural poor of that country. And this would be equally true of other&#13;
countries in the region. An average infant mortality rate of one in ten means&#13;
a rate among the rural poor which is very much higher. High infant mortality&#13;
is a product of many factors most prominently nutrition and hygienic practices&#13;
(the latter is simply a proxy for the education of the mother). In Egypt, 45&#13;
percent of reported infant deaths are from diseases of the digestive system. 2/&#13;
In Algeria the housing congestion with often 7 or more people to a room, makes&#13;
it difficult to isolate small children from contagious illnesses of other&#13;
family members. The stubborn continuance of high rates of infant mortality in&#13;
the MENA countries is an important area for research. Unfortunately the exist-&#13;
ing data in this area are very weak.&#13;
The figures for hospital beds are a little more reliable but mask&#13;
important urban/rural discrepancies. In some countries in the region the&#13;
use of health facilities is often limited by the difficulties which women and&#13;
children may have in travelling to them or in leaving home for extended&#13;
periods. In some countries there is still reluctance among husbands to permit&#13;
their wives to be examined by male doctors, and of course, the number of&#13;
female doctors lags badly with their lesser enrolment in the education system.&#13;
Studies in Afghanistan discovered a heavy bias towards adult male users of&#13;
medical facilities. There is little doubt however among the peoples of the&#13;
region of the efficacy of modern medicine and particularly pharmaceutical&#13;
1/   The Turkish figure reflects accurate reporting however, while the apparent&#13;
success of a country like Egypt in reducing its infant mortality rate to&#13;
112 per thousand i.e. below Turkey at less than 30 percent of Turkey's&#13;
per capita income, is probably mainly due to under-reporting.&#13;
2/   A recent study on Egypt makes the point that the simple medical technique&#13;
of oral rehydration could prevent many of these deaths.&#13;

products. A range of these are sold in the smallest village stores, including&#13;
some which are only available by prescription in Northern Europe for example.&#13;
If figures were available, I have little doubt that they would show&#13;
that health status is still a serious form of deprivation for the poor of the&#13;
MENA region. Even where the facilities and personnel seem to be available,&#13;
they are often not located where the poor are, i.e. in the more remote rural&#13;
regions or near the urban slums or shanty towns (bidonvilles). Afghanistan&#13;
with about 1,000 doctors overall, has 800 of them serving the less than one&#13;
million people in the capital city, while the other 200 are scattered among&#13;
the other 13 or 14 million of its population. All the countries in the region&#13;
have government health services, yet very few provide the kind of extra allow-&#13;
ances and subsidization to doctors which would induce them to practice in the&#13;
remote rural areas where they are most badly needed. Even if they can be&#13;
induced to go there, the logistical support which is needed to back them up is&#13;
often unavailable. In most countries the medical schools are in the largest&#13;
cities, the medical students are from the wealthier sections of those cities,&#13;
and when they are qualified they are expected to somehow want to go to eastern&#13;
Anatolia or Upper Egypt to practice. Inevitably what has happened has been a&#13;
drain of Egyptian doctors to Libya, Saudi Arabia or the Gulf, Iranian doctors&#13;
to the U.K and U.S., and North African doctors and nurses to France. Meanwhile&#13;
the sizeable populations in the rural areas without adequate access to medical&#13;
care go untreated.&#13;
The problems of the poor are not only a consequence of inadequate&#13;
facilities and personnel of course. They are the least educated section of&#13;
the population and therefore the least aware of basic hygienic practices.&#13;
Even if they were aware however, one wonders how much they would be able to do&#13;
about it. It can be quite costly to boil water in areas which are dependent&#13;
on dung and wood for fuel; soap and detergent is similarly often beyond the&#13;
range of the poor rural consumer. Improved nutritional practices usually mean&#13;
a more varied diet than the family can afford. Proper fuel for heating and&#13;
better shelter would doubtless cut down the heavy incidence of respiratory&#13;
diseases in areas which are snowbound in winter such as central Afghanistan,&#13;
parts of Iran and Turkey, and the mountainous areas of North Africa, but&#13;
these, along with warm clothing are also a matter of adequate incomes. Twenty&#13;
percent of the incomes of the poor in rural Turkey is spent on fuel. It is&#13;
sometimes forgotten that of the very few developing countries with below&#13;
freezing winter temperature perhaps half are in the MENA region.&#13;
Large expenditures on health in the MENA countries do not seem to&#13;
have had quite the impact on the health status of the poor which might have&#13;
been expected. Almost every report on the subject written in the region has&#13;
argued that this is because the expenditure has been concentrated on rela-&#13;
tively high quality curative medicine at the expense of the rapid expansion&#13;
of preventive medicine. If that is the case, then it is certainly hard to&#13;
account for the inadequacy and overcrowding in the large urban hospitals in&#13;
many of the MENA countries. These urban srvices are usually pro%ided free and&#13;
are an important component of health care for the urban poor. The long waits&#13;
and low quality of care effectively rations these services to those who cannot&#13;
afford private health care. I suspect that the term 'preventive medicine' is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -&#13;
used as shorthand for two quite different things. The first is the expansion&#13;
of essentially curative, basic health services into the rural areas. 1/ The&#13;
second is the linkages between health programs and other sectors; water&#13;
supply, nutrition, education and shelter.&#13;
The expansion of health facilities in the small towns and rural&#13;
areas of the MENA countries is proceeding at a rapid pace, though they tend&#13;
to be inadequately staffed for the reasons mentioned earlier. A particular&#13;
problem concerns suitably staffed facilities for women and small children,&#13;
and it would seem to be a matter of high priority to try to train more women&#13;
doctors. Aside from that however, the attention should be given to trying to&#13;
target health programs directly to the poor. 2/ In the process there is a&#13;
good chance that the rest of the population will have its needs taken care of.&#13;
This may not be the case however, if the objective is simply to expand in&#13;
orderly fashion the coverage of the present health services. As pointed out&#13;
before, however, the expansion of health services will not be enough to ensure&#13;
the necessary improvements in health status. That will require correlated&#13;
improvements in income, education, nutrition and shelter. The countries of&#13;
the MENA region are only beginning to take this broader view of the conditions&#13;
for improved health and life expectancy.&#13;
E. Education and Poverty&#13;
The countries of the MENA region clearly lag behind the comparable&#13;
East Asian and Latin American countries in the educational status of their&#13;
populations. Adult literacy in 1976 was only 54 percent in the MENA countries&#13;
as compared to 69 percent for all middle income developing countries. A closer&#13;
look at the figures makes the source of this lag quite clear. Whereas for&#13;
education of males at the primary level, the MENA countries have a higher&#13;
ratio of enrollment than other middle income ldcs (99 percent as against 94&#13;
percent), there is a radical difference in the educational position of girls.&#13;
Only 67 percent of the relevant age group is currently enrolled in primary&#13;
education as against 86 percent for all middle income ldcs. When it is&#13;
remembered that these figures almost always include a large number of overage&#13;
students and repeaters, it would probably not be far off the mark to say that&#13;
only about half of the girls in the primary age group in the MENA countries go&#13;
to school.&#13;
1/ The relative underutilization of many 'of these rural health facilities&#13;
is a topic which merits further study in the region.&#13;
2/ This is easier said than done. It is clear in extreme cases, for example,&#13;
facilities for relatively sophisticated surgical procedures may have low&#13;
priority for most countries in the region. There are' a wide range of&#13;
other activities, however, where the specifics of targetting health&#13;
programs to the poor are unclear. This seems to be another area which&#13;
might benefit from closer analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
If these figures could be broken down further they would almost&#13;
certainly reveal a startling dichotomy between the city and the countryside.&#13;
Educational facilities in general are much more limited in the rural areas&#13;
than in the cities and towns. (Primary education in Algeria is a notable&#13;
exception.) In some countries this is simply a budgetary problem. Even with&#13;
very rapid expansion, the coverage has not yet reached more remote rural areas&#13;
where costs per student may be quite high. Since primary schooling in many of&#13;
the countries in the region separates boys and girls this may be an additional&#13;
problem since in many areas population may be too spread out to justify a&#13;
classroom unless adequate transport facilities exist. This is a particularly&#13;
difficult problem in Morocco and Tunisia where the rural population lives on&#13;
its farm holdings, and is not clustered in small villages as is the case in&#13;
Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan for example. The problem of securing suitable&#13;
female teachers for remote rural areas is a particularly difficult one for&#13;
many of the countries where female education is largely urban.&#13;
But the problem is not only on the side of the supply of facilities.&#13;
In some cases the demand is also a factor. There are opportunity costs of&#13;
sending children to school. In parts of Morocco for example, girls from the&#13;
age of 5 to 12 are of great importance to household income through their&#13;
involvement in carpet-weaving. The role of boys in sheep and cattle herding&#13;
is also significant. Although the perception is gaining that the benefits of&#13;
education in the long run, particularly for boys, outweigh the costs, the very&#13;
poorest families may still experience great difficulty in being able to do&#13;
without the income from children. In such cases it is common for some of the&#13;
children in the family to attend school and others not. In Southern Tunisia&#13;
where many classrooms stand empty it seems clear that while parents maintain a&#13;
positive attitude to education they are reluctant to undertake costs which&#13;
seem high in relation to the benefits. Unemployment of school leavers in&#13;
Tunisia is very high. Low rates of enrolment in Southern Tunisia seem&#13;
therefore to have a substantial demand element in them. 1/&#13;
It would be hard to argue however, that the low rates of female&#13;
enrolment in the MENA region reflect the particularly high financial oppor-&#13;
tunity cost to the family of sending girls to school in these countries rela-&#13;
tive to other parts of the world. Clearly socio-cultural traditions are a&#13;
major factor in this regard. The early age of marriage and child-bearing is a&#13;
factor. Limited opportunities for women to benefit from their education&#13;
through employment is still a very important consideration. And finally an&#13;
unwillingness for girls and women to participate in the social situations&#13;
involved in attending a school which is a considerable distance from the home.&#13;
While these factors are very significant, the speed with which they are chang-&#13;
ing is perhaps even more impressive. In 1960, primary enrolment of girls&#13;
in the region was only 39 percent, as against 74 percent for all middle-income&#13;
ldcs. In 1976 the gap had narrowed to 67 percent in the MENA countries to 86&#13;
percent in all middle-income ldcs. If the MENA countries can keep up the same&#13;
1/   This is not to say that the appropriate policy response might not be to&#13;
increase the supply of facilities and thus bring down the cost to a point&#13;
where it is lower than what are perceived as rather limited private bene-&#13;
fits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
rate of progress in the eighties and the other middle-income ldcs continue at&#13;
their earlier pace then the gap between the two will be closed before the end&#13;
of the decade.&#13;
It is somewhat more difficult to generalize about higher education.&#13;
Some MENA countries have very high rates of secondary and higher enrolment,&#13;
others very low. No pattern is discernable. Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iran, Libya&#13;
and Kuwait have more than 40 percent secondary enrolment - the average for all&#13;
middle income ldcs is 36 percent. On the other hand Afghanistan, PDRY, YAR,&#13;
Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria had about 20 percent or less in 1977. Once again&#13;
the relevant comparator may be the increase since 1960. In that year only&#13;
Jordan and Kuwait had more than 20 percent of the relevant age group in&#13;
secondary education. Admittedly the rate of increase has been very rapid in&#13;
other comparable ldcs as well. Egypt is a particularly striking case with&#13;
regard to the percentages of enrolment for a country at its income level. The&#13;
ratios of primary to secondary to higher enrolment in Egypt are 10:6:2, as&#13;
compared to all middle income ldcs ratio of 10:4:1. This is a very question-&#13;
able composition for a country with only 72 percent primary enrolment overall,&#13;
given the costs of higher education and the fact that it is geared to middle&#13;
and upper income groups.&#13;
There is some basis for arguing that higher education as it is being&#13;
carried out today in the countries of the MENA region, and in other ldc's for&#13;
that matter, is regressive in its impact on income distribution and is re-&#13;
inforcing inequalities rather than redressing them. 1/ The first aspect of&#13;
this is who attends secondary schools. The 20 to 50 percent of the age group&#13;
which typically goes to high school in the MENA countries is heavily urban,&#13;
middle class and male. The probability of attending secondary school is one&#13;
would imagine, 100 percent for an urban male in the top 50 percent of the&#13;
income category, and zero for a rural female in the bottom 50 percent of the&#13;
income earning households. Yet not only do governments invest the large and&#13;
increasing amounts needed to provide facilities and teaching staff, which is&#13;
understandable, given overall developmental needs for trained and skilled&#13;
personnel, but they also subsidize students directly in many countries for&#13;
secondary and post-secondary attendance. The stipend for university students&#13;
has become an almost universal feature of the countries of the MENA region.&#13;
Free board and lodging is .given to students, pocket money for other expenses,&#13;
and then at the end of their studies the government guarantees employment to&#13;
graduates. In some countries there is an effort to limit these to genuine&#13;
scholarship cases, but for the most part the stipend has become a general&#13;
subsidy, eating up substantial budgetary resources. 2/ The argument that it&#13;
1/   This does not apply to some countries in the region (Algeria, Iraq,&#13;
Libya and PDRY) where income differentials are smaller and education has&#13;
been in the forefront of modernization programs.&#13;
2/   I cannot resist quoting the comment of one economist that:    "The govern-&#13;
ment provides rich students with pocket money to go and chase the girls&#13;
and put gasoline in the sports car."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
is difficult to apply a means test for subsidies in developing countries is&#13;
over-stressed - perhaps by government officials who might be ruled out from&#13;
receiving subsidies by the application of such a test. It should be possible&#13;
to develop a set of easily enforceable criteria 'hich would entail no more&#13;
bureaucratic procedures than the present system.&#13;
In *st of the countries of the region, the commitment to education&#13;
is very apparent. Perhaps the most remarkable example is the literacy campaign&#13;
on which Iraq has recently embarked. Classes are given for adults and it is&#13;
a criminal offence punishable by a $30 fine for an illiterate to refuse to&#13;
attend these (needless to say there is a fine of $90 and a one month jail&#13;
sentence for anyone who claims he can read but is then found to be illiterate).&#13;
Large proportions of the budget in countries such as Tunisia, Morocco and&#13;
Egypt are already being channelled into the education sector and it is dificult&#13;
to see that still more resources could reasonably be channelled into the&#13;
sector. What is needed is a shift in priorities in the near term away from&#13;
university education for the middle classes (often liberal arts programs with&#13;
little obvious impact on the society as a whole 1/), and greater emphasis on&#13;
extending primary education and with it basic literacy and numeracy to the&#13;
population as a whole. Once this has been done of course secondarv and higher&#13;
education will have to be expanded to meet the greater demand for places.&#13;
This will then require re-thinking curricula at secondary schools to orient&#13;
them towards vocational objectives rather than simply university entry, and&#13;
re-shaping university programs to respond more closely to future developmental&#13;
needs.&#13;
The need for more vocational and skill training is another of the&#13;
axioms which recur in almost every Bank report on the MENA region. Advice on&#13;
this subject needs to be a good deal more discriminating than it has been in&#13;
the past, in identifying the country situations which are relevant. Another&#13;
key factor is the kind of training to be given. Tunisia has two vocational&#13;
training programs. One, run by the Ministry of Education, has not been effec-&#13;
tive, and only 50 percent of the graduates have been able to find employment&#13;
within a year of graduation. A second, run by the Ministry of Labor is care-&#13;
fully related to the projected needs of private and public industry, and in&#13;
this case 92 percent of graduates have been placed within a year.&#13;
Education, which should be one of the most powerful instruments for&#13;
the poor of the MENA countries to improve their incomes and the quality of&#13;
their lives, is not adequately serving this function at present. In many&#13;
countries it is simply re-inforcing traditional socio-economic structures,&#13;
and producing unemployable graduates. Where governments have adequate resour-&#13;
ces, most notably in the oil-producing countries, there is a tremendous&#13;
expansion of educational facilities. Where resources are contrained however,&#13;
the choice is too often being made on the side of pouring funds into intensive&#13;
programs focussed on the urban middle-classes and not enough or extensive&#13;
programs to achieve proper coverage of the rural poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -&#13;
F. The Urban/Rural Contrast&#13;
The contrast between urban and rural living standards has emerged as&#13;
a constant theme in the preceding sections. There are a number of reasons&#13;
why this should be so. They do not differ I suspect from the pattern in other&#13;
regions. On the income side the problems relate to low levels of agricultural&#13;
productivity, unequal distribution of land holdings and fragmented labor&#13;
markets in rural areas. In urban areas on the other hand there are usually&#13;
high rates of modern sector investment being undertaken in most cases by the&#13;
government in state run enterprises or utilities, and the labor market operates&#13;
somewhat more efficiently, at least for the private sector. As mentioned&#13;
earlier, higher urban incomes are not always offset by higher urban living&#13;
costs. In Tunisia average incomes are 160 percent of the national average in&#13;
the big cities and 72 percent of the national average in the rural areas, and&#13;
food subsidies still chiefly benefit those in the urban areas. But the&#13;
contrast between rural and urban areas is even more striking with respect to&#13;
the availability of social services. Why is this the case? Perhaps the most&#13;
important factor is the sheer logic of expanding a program from a small base.&#13;
When the question arises of rural water supply in Afghanistan for example, it&#13;
is rightly pointed out that the responsible institution hardly has the capacity&#13;
to reach more than a very small proportion of the better off residents of the&#13;
capital city, let alone expand its activities to encompass the rural areas.&#13;
Even where a separate institution was created to deal with rural water supply&#13;
its capacity to contruct and maintain systems limited it to a tiny number of&#13;
villages in the initial years of the program. The example could be generalized&#13;
to most spheres of development activity and certainly to most of the social&#13;
programs.&#13;
But even where there is a competent central organization which could&#13;
organise the expansion of social programs, there may be constraints of resources&#13;
and staffing. Many, though not all, social services are more expensive to&#13;
distribute in the rural areas where population is spread out, and rates of&#13;
capacity utilization may be low. Governments which reach 70 or 80 percent of&#13;
the population in fields such as primary education, including a good proportion&#13;
of the rural population, are often put off by the costs of reaching the last&#13;
20 and 30 percent who may be spread over large areas with low-density settle-&#13;
ments. The expansion of primary education in Southern Tunisia is an excellent&#13;
example of this. Getting suitably trained school teachers to go out to small&#13;
rural communities, particularly women teachers, or for that matter trained&#13;
personnel in any area of the social services, is often very difficult. This&#13;
is not merely a matter of a preference for being near the city or near their&#13;
family. Often the move to rural areas may involve economic hardship such as&#13;
the loss of a second job or supplementary income from private practice or extra&#13;
lessons. Few governments in the region provide adequate financial incentives&#13;
to personnel to re-locate in rural areas.&#13;
The reasons for rural neglect go beyond these factors however, to&#13;
the relative weakness of the lobbies for rural social expenditures. On the&#13;
one hand this is by default. The urban lobbies are much more powerful polit-&#13;
ically with the opportunity to make their presence felt directly. Where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161-&#13;
governments are forced into explicit choices between say food subsidies which&#13;
are substantially geared to assisting the urban working class, particularly&#13;
the middle and lower ranks of the civil service, and direct investment expendi-&#13;
tures on rural development, the experience in say Turkey and Egypt is that it&#13;
is the former which wins out. The civil service itself is a powerful lobby&#13;
against the kind of development which might require a devolution of authority&#13;
from the center to the regions and might even necessitate their own re-location&#13;
in the rural areas. It would not be very difficult for a government to&#13;
require that service in rural areas is a requirement for entry into or promo-&#13;
tion or whatever at some stage of a civil service career, yet very few coun-&#13;
tries in the region have such a requirement and then only in specific fields.&#13;
The consequence of this is urban growth rates of four to five percent&#13;
per annum in most countries of the region, and a disproportion between rural&#13;
and urban indicators that is quite striking. If it were possible to show each&#13;
of the main social indicators according to this breakdown, the urban figure in&#13;
most categories would be about double the rural figure in primary enrolment and&#13;
far higher in secondary enrolment and ratios of health facilities and personnel&#13;
to population. One should probably sub-divide the categories into the major&#13;
cities and other urban areas, because even between these groups there would be&#13;
significant differences. Similarly the rural areas often divide up between&#13;
those which are substantially modernized with a good deal of exchange with&#13;
relatively accessible nearby cities and towns, and others which are more&#13;
remote and essentially subsistence in character. The Mediterranean areas&#13;
of many of the countries of the region contrast quite strikingly with the&#13;
interior areas.&#13;
It would be unfair not to allow for the possibility that it may make&#13;
perfect sense, given the difficulties of administration and finance, for&#13;
governments to neglect the expansion of social services in the rural areas and&#13;
implicitly encourage urban migration and increasing concentration of the popu-&#13;
lation. The slums of Cairo, the bidonvilles of Morocco and the extreme over-&#13;
crowding in Algerian cities, suggest however, that a pace of urbanization&#13;
which is greater than the administration can deal with may not be to the&#13;
countries' best advantage, nor even minimize the costs of providing social&#13;
services in the longer run. The marginal cost of providing adequate housing&#13;
within a very short period, may for example, be much higher in the urban&#13;
than in the rural areas. 1/ It would seem that a re-direction of government&#13;
expenditures to rural areas, combined with greater devolution of administra-&#13;
tion and financial authority to the local level would offer a better balance&#13;
than at present. There is at least one example of this in the region which is&#13;
well on the way to being a success story. The YAR has used a limited amount&#13;
1/   This must be qualified however.   Although the housing stock in the rural,&#13;
areas is more adequate than in urban areas given differential population&#13;
growth rates, rural housing remains a major problem in the poverty&#13;
complex in the MENA region. Compared to any other less developed region,&#13;
the need is far greater in the MENA countries for a structure which keeps&#13;
out winter _cond. This is another area in which real costs in the rural&#13;
areas may not be as different from the urban areas as is usually assumed.&#13;
The rural housing problem in these countries has been much too little&#13;
studied relative to its importance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
162 -&#13;
of central government resources as the seed for subtantial development activi-&#13;
ties through largely independent Local Development Associations. While these&#13;
are still at an early stage, the achievements in a short period have been&#13;
notable and suggest that other countries in the region would do well to&#13;
consider similar experiments of this kind.&#13;
G. The Male/Female Contrast&#13;
The contrast between the standards of education and health of men&#13;
and women in the countries of the MENA region is apparent in the discussion&#13;
in the preceding sections. It is not clear to what extent such differences&#13;
reflect the social and cultural traditions of the countries of the region&#13;
and to what extent they are simply the same aspects of underdevelopment which&#13;
characterize other countries of similar income levels. The evidence that was&#13;
drawn from the sections on education and health suggests that the problem is&#13;
somewhat more serious than in countries at similar income levels in other&#13;
regions, and this may indeed reflect the role which women play in those&#13;
societies which interpret Islamic traditions in a very conservative fashion.&#13;
In many of the MENA countries however, the change which is taking place,&#13;
in the perception of women's role, is very striking indeed. The emphasis being&#13;
placed in very recent years on education of girls in societies such as Saudi&#13;
Arabia, Iraq and Algeria, provides evidence of a new recognition, not just of&#13;
the potential economic role which women can play in these societies, but the&#13;
inter-relation between women's education and standards of nutrition and&#13;
health.  It isn't possible to establish a neat causal relationship between&#13;
these other aspects of development and women's education, but there is little&#13;
reason to doubt such a relationship. The most striking examples of women's&#13;
advancement have been' in Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt where among the urban&#13;
middle-classes a degree of equality has been attained which is impressive by&#13;
any standards. The short distance to the rural areas even in these countries,&#13;
however, will reveal the substantial distance which still has to be travelled.&#13;
There have been d'isturbing reversals of this trend-recently, in&#13;
countries in which political change seems to have become identified with a&#13;
rejection of what are perceived as modern or western values. The position of&#13;
women has become a rallying point for those who seek a return to traditional&#13;
ways. It is valid to ask whether such a reaction might not be the precursor&#13;
of similar movements in other countries, whether associated with fundamental&#13;
political changes or not. This is an important question which a study of this&#13;
kind can only pay very casual attention to. It would seem politic to give&#13;
thought to the kind of development which poses the least threat in the&#13;
short-term to traditional values, through for example the development of&#13;
separate facilities in health and education and even in areas related to the&#13;
economy. It may involve some costly duplication in the short run, but it&#13;
might better insure the success of the objectives of upgrading the health and&#13;
education standards of the whole population in the long run.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 163 -&#13;
It is apparent that the position of women is a poverty issue and&#13;
not only a social one. There are few girls schools in rural areas. The rich&#13;
can afford to send their daughters to board with relatives in the cities, but&#13;
not the poor. The contrast between the better off and the rest of the popula-&#13;
tion is never as sharp as with respect to women's education in the rural&#13;
areas.   It is in large measure a question of getting suitable women teachers&#13;
and for that matter nurses and doctors to the rural areas, and in this regard&#13;
the discussions earlier about providing appropriate incentives are a relevant&#13;
consideration. One additional point concerns the problems which often face&#13;
divorced women in these societies. This is perhaps more serious in MENA than&#13;
other regions given the relative ease and frequency of divorce, and the&#13;
helplessness of these uneducated and untrained women from poor families which&#13;
can provide little support to them.&#13;
H. The Impact of Migration&#13;
Migration across national borders has become an increasingly signifi-&#13;
cant variable in the socio-economic future of the MENA countries. The total&#13;
number of migrants who live and work voluntarily in countries other than&#13;
their country of origin is probably of the order of 6 million people. While&#13;
this is only equal to about 3 percent of the region's population, when it&#13;
is remembered that these are mainly single men who often support large families&#13;
at home, the impact of migration can be seen to be much more significant. It&#13;
is probably fair to say that about one in every ten people in the MENA coun-&#13;
tries now obtains a portion of their total income from earners who work in&#13;
other countries. Taking total migrants of 6 million and assuming that each&#13;
sends back only $1,000 a year, already brings the total income from remittances&#13;
to $6 billion or $30 for every MENA resident. In fact, average remittances&#13;
are probably considerably larger than this figure. In Morocco they average&#13;
$4000 per migrant per year, and in Turkey about $2000. Even $30 per capita in&#13;
countries such as Afghanistan, Egypt, YAR and PDRY is a useful addition to the&#13;
available income, however.&#13;
Initially the migrants were not the poorest members of the community.&#13;
They usually came from families with a little land, so that the harvest could&#13;
provide the capital for the first trip abroad. The landless were not able to&#13;
migrate because their savings were inadequate to pay the initial expenses and&#13;
to support the family during the waiting period before the first transfer of&#13;
income. They were usually from families in which one or more of the sons was&#13;
underemployed on the family holding. Of course there was migration from the&#13;
urban areas as well, fueled by the open unemployment in many of the urban&#13;
areas. By now however, migration comes from almost every section of the&#13;
society. The evident high returns have made it possible for even some of the&#13;
poorer families to borrow to pay for a son to travel to Saudi Arabia or Libya,&#13;
or for that matter France and Germany, though there is no longer net migration&#13;
to Northern Europe.&#13;
55.       It would be nice to be able to answer questions such as whether&#13;
there has been a substantial brain drain from certain countries and whether&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 -&#13;
income from remittances is sufficient to reimburse the country for the invest-&#13;
ment in educating professionals and skilled workers. The benefits from the&#13;
migration of unskilled workers are less ambiguous. Most of the sending&#13;
countries have unemployment or underemployment at home and the workers abroad&#13;
may pick up basic skills which are useful to the country on their return. And&#13;
by and large the workers in other Arab countries do return. Th4s is less&#13;
clear in the case of the Turkish migration to Germany and the North African&#13;
migration to France, where those who return, do 8o mainly for retirement.&#13;
What happens to the money the migrants send back? Is it channelled&#13;
into investment, or does it go into consumption of durables or for that matter&#13;
simply the family's subsistence? Once again the facts are slim. There are&#13;
micro studies on the impact of migrant earnings on rural communities in Turkey&#13;
and Tunisia. The one case where special efforts have been made to try to&#13;
channel migrant earnings into investment, particularly in agriculture, is in&#13;
Turkey where there are schemes based on the co-operatives and private groups.&#13;
For the rest, migrant earnings seem to go mainly into constructing a house or&#13;
purchasing land or a car. In Algeria so much of the remittances went into&#13;
large cars and taxis that the government has now put a stop to it. In Turkey&#13;
there were also imports of cars and tractors - the latter contributing to the&#13;
over-mechanization of agriculture. It is a common sight in many of the&#13;
countries of the region to see houses in various stages of completion waiting&#13;
for the next transfer to come from the father, brother or son abroad, before&#13;
the work is re-commenced. The example of the YAR local development associa-&#13;
tions, quoted earlier, is good evidence of what can be done if attempts are&#13;
made to channel the considerable funds flowing into the rural areas in the&#13;
MENA countries into development projects which have a base of popular support.&#13;
Another good example is the successful efforts of the Credits Populaires in&#13;
North Africa to attract immigrants savings and re-lend them for small-scale&#13;
projects.&#13;
I. Eliminating Poverty in the Region&#13;
For most of the countries in the region the goal should not be&#13;
reducing poverty, but eliminating it. It is convenient to discuss this in&#13;
terms of the growth of income and population on the one hand and the distribu-&#13;
tion of income on the other. The starting point is growth in total income.&#13;
Can the 7 percent per annum which has been achieved so far in the 70s, be&#13;
maintained during the rest of the century. This is of course in large part a&#13;
guess about the future trend in oil revenues. It seems unlikely that the real&#13;
growth can be maintained over such a long period.   In addition, some resis-&#13;
tance is likely to develop to increasing numbers of migrant workers in the&#13;
recipient countries. However, other forms of spillover may become signif-&#13;
icant. The investment by oil producing countries in other MENA countries has&#13;
been a trickle so far. In addition the flow of exports from other MENA coun-&#13;
tries into the oil producing states in the form of agricultural commodities&#13;
and manufactured consumer goods, is also likely to accelerate.&#13;
The political volatility of the MENA region and the uncertainties&#13;
about oil prices make any attempt to project income trends extremely hazardous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-- .65 -&#13;
A first group of countries in which growth prospects appear good, include the&#13;
oil producing countries which have been politically stable over the past&#13;
decade: Algeria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya. The outlook is also&#13;
promising in those countries which are well placed to benefit from remittances&#13;
and agricultural exports, particularly Jordan, Syria and YAR. Finally Tunisia,&#13;
with its proven record of good economic management, should continue to grow at&#13;
a rapid pace. The picture is more mixed in the remaining MENA countries,&#13;
where political instability and/or the need to come to grips with economic&#13;
and administrative constraints may limit growth in the period. The last group&#13;
includes some of the most populous countries in the region; and four of the&#13;
five poorest countries as well. It is reasonable to expect growth in the&#13;
first group of countries mentioned above of the order of 5 to 8 percent&#13;
per annum, while for the countries in the second group a range of 3 to 6&#13;
percent per annum might be more realistic.&#13;
Population has grown at 2.6 percent per annum between 1960 and 1977&#13;
in the MENA region. What will be the growth rate through the remainder of&#13;
this century? The factors which will determine population growth are first of&#13;
all the rate of growth and distribution of income, second the spread of health&#13;
and education facilities and third the commitment of MENA governments to popu-&#13;
lation planning. It is surprising how important this last factor seems to&#13;
have been in determining different country achievements in the past. If the&#13;
mix of factors is no different from the past then only a small decline can be&#13;
projected in the rate of population growth. That there will be any decline at&#13;
all is largely attributable to the fact that the major improvement in death&#13;
rates has already taken place so that future declines in birth rates will not&#13;
be offset by more than proportionate lowering of death rates. In three coun-&#13;
tries, Afghanistan, YAR and PDRY, this is not the case, however, and the pros-&#13;
pects are for a higher rate of population growth. In other countries in the&#13;
region declines can be expected. In most cases the year 2000 should see birth&#13;
rates down to 30, except for Turkey and Tunisia where they should be lower&#13;
still. A best guess would be a population growth rate of 2.0 percent in the&#13;
year 2000 and an average of 2.3 percent per annum in the intervening period.&#13;
I shall leave aside for the moment the question of whether this should be an&#13;
acceptable scenario to the governments of the region.&#13;
Growth in per capita income in the MENA region from the present to&#13;
the year 2000, may average something of the order of 2.2 percent per annum.&#13;
This rather low figure is in large part a consequence of the heavy weighting&#13;
of large countries in which growth is projected below the average. This&#13;
assumes much the same mix of economic policies as in the past, and the limited&#13;
population planning efforts cited in the preceding paragraph. The consequence&#13;
of this would be average income in the region 70 percent above the 1977 level&#13;
by the year 2000 i.e. $2264 per capita, but under $1700 if the three high&#13;
income oil producing countries are excluded (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya). 1/&#13;
In para. 2, I classified the countries in the region into low income (below&#13;
$600), middle-income ($600-$1200) and high income (above $1200). Three&#13;
of the five countries in the low income groups would still fall into that&#13;
1/   All figures in this and succeeding paragraphs are in 1977 dollars unless&#13;
otherwise indicated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 166 -&#13;
category in the year 2000 (Afghanistan, Egypt, and PDRY). The other two low&#13;
income countries would move into the middle income group (Morocco and YAR).&#13;
All six countries which are currently in the middle income group would move&#13;
well beyond it into an income category between $1500 to $2000 (Jordan, Tunisia,&#13;
Syria, Algeria, Turkey and Lebanon). This widening disparity on a regional&#13;
basis reflects the assumption cited above that policies and population efforts&#13;
are not changed. In practice one wonders whether there would not be profound&#13;
political changes in the lagging economies in the face of continuing slow&#13;
growth. In addition large labor forces at relatively low wages in countries&#13;
like Egypt and Morocco might well make them an attractive focus for capital&#13;
investment from the oil surplus countries.&#13;
The high income countries in the region will have the resources to&#13;
eliminate poverty. Whether this will indeed be achieved will depend on the&#13;
distribution of income in those countries. A useful proxy for this can be got&#13;
by using the data on income distribution in Turkey and Tunisia which are among&#13;
the more reliable for any countries in the region. In 1973 the bottom 20 per-&#13;
cent in Turkey had an income which was on average 17 percent of the national&#13;
per capita income. In 1977 this would have been equivalent to $190 per capita&#13;
as compared to the national average of $1110. In that same year the poverty&#13;
cut-off was $230 in the rural areas and about $400 in the urban areas. In the&#13;
year 2000 we can estimate income levels in Turkey at about $1800 per capita.&#13;
With no change in income distribution the bottom 20 percent will receive on&#13;
average $306 per capita in the year 2000. Even with no change in the real&#13;
level of the poverty cut-off, a reasonable assumption about distribution of&#13;
income within the bottom quintile suggests that there will still be a substan-&#13;
tial number of absolute poor in Turkey in that year. Tunisia should have the&#13;
same real income per capita as Turkey by the year 2000 (i.e. $1800), but with&#13;
the bottom quintile receiving 25 percent of the national income per capita on&#13;
average, their income level would be $450 which could reasonably be expected to&#13;
result in the virtual elimination of poverty. The significance of rather small&#13;
shifts in the share of the bottom quintile is important. It suggests that if&#13;
the richer countries were able to target even two or three percent of their GNP&#13;
in programs which would directly assist the very poorest groups, the problems&#13;
of the poor, at least in the high income MENA countries, would be well on the&#13;
way to solution. The poverty problem is far less sensitive to even major&#13;
acceleration in the rate of growth of income. For the bottom quintile in&#13;
Turkey to achieve the same income level in the year 2000 as the bottom quintile&#13;
in Tunisia, income in Turkey would need to reach $2650 instead of the $1800&#13;
which is projected above, in the absence of changes in income distribution.&#13;
This assumption of no change in income distribution can be tested&#13;
with the help of Tunisian consumption surveys undertaken in 1966 and 1975.&#13;
During this period, the share of the bottom quintile in total income fell from&#13;
7 percent to 5 percent. In other words, while per capita income rose during&#13;
the period by 60 percent on average, from $510 to $820, the income of the&#13;
bottom quintile rose by only 14 percent on average, from $180 to $205. The&#13;
data suggests that the participation of the very poorest group in the growth&#13;
of one of the world's most rapidly expanding economies, was disappointing.&#13;
The Tunisian data raises a number of interesting questions. Why, for example&#13;
was the second lowest quintile able to maintain its share of income? Is there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
perhaps some rigidity in the labor market which prevents demand from reaching&#13;
the poorest group? If one went back before 1966 would one observe a redistri-&#13;
bution towards the poor as a consequence of the social programs of the early&#13;
sixties, and could the levelling off of expenditures on these programs be a&#13;
factor in the worsening relative position of the lowest 20 percent?&#13;
The generalization I would draw from the foregoing is that without&#13;
redistributive programs targetted at the bottom 20 percent the mixed economies&#13;
which will fall into the category of high income MENA will still have substan-&#13;
tial pockets of poverty remaining in the year 2000 (Turkey, Tunisia and Iran).&#13;
This may also apply to those countries with major exogenous income sources&#13;
which go directly to the state. In their cases, however, the constraint will&#13;
relate to the effectiveness of the redistributive program which they are&#13;
pursuing, i.e. their capacity to design and implement such programs (Algeria&#13;
and Iraq).&#13;
The more serious problem for the region is the countries which will&#13;
still fall into the categories of low and middle income MENA by the year 2000.&#13;
These five countries (Afghanistan, Egypt, PDRY, Morocco and YAR) have 36 per-&#13;
cent of the region's population (77 millions), but 50 percent of its poor (24&#13;
millions). The first four of the countries in this group are also expected to&#13;
be among the slowest growing in the region, so that overall there is little&#13;
confidence that the numbers of the poor will decline in absolute terms.&#13;
What can these countries do about poverty during the next two&#13;
decades? It is perhaps inevitable that the countries where the poverty&#13;
problems are severest are also those which are worst placed in terms of&#13;
financial and administrative capacity to tackle them. Expenditures on&#13;
basic needs activities in these countries are already a high proportion of&#13;
total public expenditures (about 50 percent in Egypt for example). Can we&#13;
in good conscience suggest further increases? In Egypt and Afghanistan a&#13;
number of observers have suggested that the government should indeed adopt&#13;
strategies which are specifically basic needs oriented. Although in both&#13;
these countries the proposals are couched in terms of shifting public&#13;
expenditures out of costly indiscriminate subsidies and programs in health and&#13;
education which emphasize quality and have little benefit for the poor, there&#13;
is still a large additional amount which must be funded. In Egypt, it was&#13;
estimated that the total amount required annually to provide full satisfaction&#13;
of basic needs, was nearly three times the level of gross domestic investment.&#13;
That comparison makes the trade-off between growth and accelerating&#13;
the time schedule for poverty elimination all too apparent. Is it reasonable&#13;
to ask the very poorest countries in the region to slow their growth rate in&#13;
order to achieve the income distribution implied by a basic needs strategy?&#13;
Even if it could be argued that additional resources would be made available&#13;
from external sources to do this, is it reasonable even to ask that those&#13;
additional resources be used for basic needs and not for more investment. Up&#13;
to a point it probably is. The lack of basic literacy and numeracy, and&#13;
simple mechanical skills is a major development constraint in many of the&#13;
countries of the region, and certainly in Afghanistan and Morocco. The same&#13;
can be said about preventive medicine and the availability of basic health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
care. In many countries in the region the limits to such programs are set by&#13;
the lack of capacity to plan, staff and administer them, rather than just&#13;
financial resources. The Tunisian experience suggests that the active pursuit&#13;
of basic needs can promote development rather than delay it.&#13;
There are no hard and fast rules for the poorest countries. It is&#13;
a matter of balancing a program of carefully selected high return investment&#13;
projects on the one hand with the expansion of basic needs through low cost&#13;
programs at a rate consistent with the capacity to staff and administer such&#13;
programs. In practice it is perhaps easier than it sounds to indicate at&#13;
least the direction in which a better balance might be achieved. The regime&#13;
in Afghanistan prior to 1977 with its strong etatist biases attempted to steer&#13;
donors in the direction of establishing heavy industry with demonstrably low&#13;
or negative returns. At the same time, despite a literacy rate of 10 percent&#13;
and infant mortality of 269 per thousand births, there was little effort at&#13;
breaking the administrative bottlenecks to expanding health and education&#13;
programs. It required no great analytical expertise to see that the wrong&#13;
balance had been struck in that situation. On the other hand in Egypt the&#13;
Bank has argued that subsidies and costly programs which do not reach the&#13;
poor should be more carefully targetted so as to benefit them and that the&#13;
savings from doing this would then be available either for expanded coverage&#13;
of the basic needs of the poor or to expand productive investment. This of&#13;
course still begs the question of the choice between the two alternatives, but&#13;
the decision can be a pragmatic one which examines the relative costs and&#13;
returns of individual programs and projects.&#13;
Poverty elimination is a matter of either raising the incomes of the&#13;
poor through growth or through increasing their share in total income. Care-&#13;
fully targetted basic needs programs can be a major means of achieving both&#13;
these objectives. There are however many other approaches which ought to&#13;
complement such programs and it would take a separate study to cover them&#13;
adequately, but for the sake of completeness let me deal with them briefly.&#13;
There is the potential for redistribution of assets through nationalization of&#13;
private industry and trade and particularly through land reform. Nationalizing&#13;
private business would have no direct impact on the poor; in principle profits&#13;
which earlier accrued to private industrialists could be channelled into&#13;
social programs, but in practice the experience has been that public enterprises&#13;
become a drain on the budget rather than a source of additional funds. It is&#13;
not clear to what extent land reform programs in the very poorest countries&#13;
(e.g. Afghanistan, Egypt and Morocco) would actually help the poorest and to&#13;
what extent they would mainly affect the relative shares of the higher quintiles.&#13;
The lowest quintile which comprises mainly the landless agricultural workers&#13;
might not be much helped by such programs, depending on their design. This&#13;
carries no implication on the desirability or otherwise of the land reform&#13;
program but cautions that its impact on poverty may be less than is sometimes&#13;
thought. The most important impact of asset redistribution on poverty may be&#13;
through changing the political power structure within the country. In addition&#13;
to direct re-distributive measures, governments can choose investments or&#13;
introduce polices which have a disproportionate impact on the poor. Pilot&#13;
rural development programs have appeared to be very effective in the MENA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
region in this regard but questions of their replicability in terms of re-&#13;
sources and management remain. Policies to promote small industry and to&#13;
insure that labor markets function efficiently can also have high returns in&#13;
terms of their poverty impact.&#13;
Are the MENA government committed to poverty alleviation? I would&#13;
answer a qualified yes. There has always been a strong streak of mutual&#13;
responsibility in the social fabric of the MENA countries, which comes at&#13;
least in part from their traditions. The rich have responsibilities towards&#13;
the poor. Nor are there social barriers between income groups of the kind&#13;
that prevail in other parts of the world. The richest man in the village&#13;
would think nothing of squatting next to his poorest neighbor at the nearby&#13;
'chaikhana' in Afghanistan or Turkey and discussing matters of common interest.&#13;
In the rather arid countries of the region, irrigation systems also impose a&#13;
mutual interdependence. The performance of governments of quite different&#13;
stripe in Algeria, Tunisia, Iraq and YAR provides ample evidence of commitment&#13;
to poverty elimination. The yes is qualified however, because of the political&#13;
volatility of the region. At times of political uncertainty and during&#13;
recurrent periods of national rivalries, the interests of the poor seem&#13;
to get lost in the shuffle. Resources which might be directed towards the&#13;
struggle against poverty have been funnelled into military hardware and large&#13;
standing armies as in Iran prior to 1979, 1/ or have been used to benefit&#13;
disproportionately politically powerful groups such as the civil servants and&#13;
modern sector workers in certain countries in the region. The fate of the&#13;
poor in the MENA countries may lie as much if not more in the settlement of&#13;
the region's political conflicts than in the mechanisms of economic policy.&#13;
J. Some Conclusions and Questions&#13;
What will the region look like in the year 2000? The average income&#13;
of the countries other than Saudi Arabia, Libya and Kuwait would be around&#13;
$1700. The social indicators would still lag somewhat relative to income.&#13;
Life expectancy would probably have risen to about 62 or 63. Literacy levels&#13;
should have moved up to about 60 percent of the population in the region&#13;
(perhaps 80 percent of males and 40 percent of females). Infant mortality&#13;
1/   The impact of high levels of mobilization on income distribution is quite&#13;
complex however. In a static sense the relatively poor almost certainly&#13;
gain since most servicemen would be drawn from lower income groups while&#13;
taxes would be paid mainly by upper income groups. However the poor are&#13;
probably worse off in the long run since services and investments which&#13;
affect them directly are often residually determined and this residual&#13;
will be smaller if there is a large military budget to be financed. This&#13;
will only be true however if it is assumed that the tax effort would be&#13;
maintained in the context of a reduction in military expenditure - a&#13;
questionable assumption. This topic seems to raise a set of questions&#13;
which might repay further examination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 170 -&#13;
should have come down from over 100 per 1000 births to around 70. The propor-&#13;
tion of the population which is urban will have moved up from about 45 percent&#13;
at present to about 60 percent and open unemployment and problems relating to&#13;
urban congestion are likely to be among the most serious which policy-makers&#13;
will face.&#13;
When one deals with the very long term it is often difficult to see&#13;
the relevance of factors like efficiency or alternative growth strategies.&#13;
The inexorable effect of compounding positive trends seems to reduce all poli-&#13;
cies to seeming insignificance. For example if Egypt were to be able to halve&#13;
its population growth rate immediately it would achieve its growth target for&#13;
the year 2000 by the year 1995. When you reduce such an enormous change to&#13;
a matter of a few years of growth it becomes harder to motivate administrators&#13;
to make the kinds of effort which are implied. Similarly with the indicators&#13;
for human resource development. A figure of say 30 to 35 million poor in the&#13;
year 2000 for example is only 8 to 10 percent of the region's population in&#13;
that year and it is tempting to project a few years beyond that and demons-&#13;
trate that by the year 2020 absolute poverty in the region is close to being&#13;
entirely eliminated.&#13;
We are not in the business of taking the long historical view,&#13;
however. Each point on the growth rate may be only five years of difference&#13;
but that is too long a stretch in the life of an individual for us to write it&#13;
off. Choosing wisely from among the policies which offer the greatest good to&#13;
the greatest number within a time-frame which recognizes the rights of the&#13;
present without mortgaging those of the future - this should be active pursuit&#13;
of the governments of the MENA region. It may be true that in time everyone&#13;
will get their share of the benefits of growth, but if 'in time' covers a&#13;
period when large-scale poverty persists, huge numbers remain uneducated,&#13;
and one in ten infants die before their first birthday, then it is not enough.&#13;
We have suggested in the course of these pages that there are things the&#13;
governments'of the MENA region could do, which they are not now doing, to&#13;
improve the situation of the poor and develop human resources more rapidly.&#13;
I can only delineate in general terms the areas which this brief&#13;
study has suggested would repay further analysis and review.    These include:&#13;
a.   An assessment of the costs of rapid population growth, not only&#13;
at the macro level, but also in terms of the quality of life of&#13;
the family. An examination of the relative success of Tunisia in&#13;
reducing population, and the continued high population growth, even&#13;
with substantial income growth, in Algeria and Syria. Will higher&#13;
incomes and increased education and employment of women in the&#13;
MENA region be sufficient in themselves to bring down the very&#13;
high crude.birth rates which persist overall?&#13;
b.   A study of the impact of food subsidies on the poor. Is subsidized&#13;
food reaching the rural areas? Is this an efficient form of income&#13;
redistribution? Is it possible to develop alternative approaches&#13;
which limit the number of commodities, or are targetted to specific&#13;
sub-groups of the population? Would alternate packages of invest-&#13;
ment, geared more narrowly to urban or rural poverty groups, be more&#13;
effective?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 171 -&#13;
c.   Food supplies in the region are adequate, yet chronic malnutrition&#13;
persists in many areas. The linkages between nutrition and popula-&#13;
tion growth, health, education and income distribution need a great&#13;
deal more analysis to identify appropriate policies in this area.&#13;
d.   Relsted to this is the question of school-feeding schemes.    This&#13;
has only been introduced to a limited extent in the MENA region and&#13;
then only in the more accessible, usually urban areas. Would such&#13;
schemes be more effective in targetting food supplies to vulnerable&#13;
groups? Are there low-cost schemes and fairly simple approaches to&#13;
prevent corruption which could be replicated in the MENA region?&#13;
How successful has the Algerian school lunch program been in these&#13;
respects?&#13;
e.   A study on the factors which lead to continuing high rates of infant&#13;
mortality in the MENA region. What are the components of programs&#13;
which could lead to an improvement? Could such components be&#13;
introduced on an efficient low-cost basis?&#13;
f.   A comparative examination of the countries of the MENA region to&#13;
see where increased coverage of the population by health personnel&#13;
and facilities has been achieved with relatively low cost. A study&#13;
of programs to expand the training of women doctors and nurses.&#13;
Can incentives be provided to encourage doctors to practice in&#13;
rural areas and can the enormous problem of enabling women doctors&#13;
and nurses to practice in such areas be solved?&#13;
g.   A study of the education of girls in the MENA region.    How can the&#13;
bottleneck of educating girls in the rural areas be broken? Has&#13;
it been done successfully in individual cases and what is the basis&#13;
for that success?&#13;
h.   The budgetary implications of full coverage.    Can the average cost&#13;
per student be brought down? Can higher education be made more&#13;
cost-effective and can the stipends now given largely indiscrim-&#13;
inately to college students, be targetted to those who really need&#13;
them?&#13;
i.   An examination of the special problem of providing education and&#13;
other social services in areas of low-density settlement. Are there&#13;
approaches through boarding, or transportation of either pupils or&#13;
teachers which could be cost-effective in dealing with these diffi-&#13;
cult but important fringes of population? The education of nomads&#13;
should also be considered in this category.&#13;
j.   Are curricula in the MENA region at the secondary and higher levels&#13;
adequately geared to the needs of developing countries? Can and&#13;
should the automatic link between higher education and government&#13;
employment be broken?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
172 -&#13;
k.   Is there scope to do more in the way of non-formal education of&#13;
adults? The experiment in Iraq and also the program which is&#13;
underway in Afghanistan should be monitored closely to assess their&#13;
impact.&#13;
1.   How can rural neglect be redressed?   What is the experience with&#13;
devolution of administrative and financial authority to local units,&#13;
in the MENA countries? Could compulsory rural service by civil&#13;
servants contribute to this? The Local Development Association&#13;
in YAR are a particularly impressive example of what can be done.&#13;
This should be monitored and an attempt made to assess the kinds of&#13;
factors which have made it successful.&#13;
m.   Are there traditional constraints to the development of women in&#13;
some MENA countries which could be relieved through a careful program&#13;
which builds on traditional values in the first instance rather than&#13;
issuing a direct challenge to them? Should some of these countries&#13;
consider 'affirmative action' for women in areas such as education&#13;
and employment?&#13;
n.   How can the resources, which migration is transferring to the rural&#13;
areas of many of the MENA countries, be channelled into activities&#13;
which will have a long term impact? What measures have been taken by&#13;
countries in the region so far?&#13;
O.   Much more work is needed in the MENA countries on how rural labor&#13;
markets operate and how increased labor demand can be translated&#13;
into effective income redistribution through wage rates and employ-&#13;
ment levels.&#13;
74.       I make no apologies for concluding with a set of questions rather&#13;
than answers.  I think they are important questions and in many cases have&#13;
not been asked at all or at least not asked loudly enough, which is why&#13;
there are so few answers around. Of the various less developed regions, the&#13;
MENA countries are likely to face the least constraints in terms of resources&#13;
in providing answers to these questions. It will be pity if they do not face&#13;
up to the questions and try to develop responses which could lead to improve-&#13;
ments in living standards of all the people in the region - a goal which would&#13;
seem to be in reach given the resources the countries in the region will have&#13;
at their disposal.&#13;

Historical and Political Setting&#13;
Latin America was colonized by the Spanish and the Portuguese who&#13;
imposed a centralized political and cultural system. Pre-Columbian cultures&#13;
survived only beyond the effective reach of European colonization, and were&#13;
not allowed to influence the formal system of education; the bulk of the&#13;
native populations of, Latin America were in effect left out until Independence&#13;
(and often much later) of the formal system of human resources development&#13;
and speak little or no Spanish. 'This is in contrast to some parts of the&#13;
developing world where a strong cultural heritage survived the introduction&#13;
of Western civilization, and where there is considerable cultural homogeneity.&#13;
There the provision of social services such as health and education has, as&#13;
everywhere, evolved originally to cater to the elites and have later spread&#13;
out to reach a larger part of the population.&#13;
In Spanish America this process has from the time of colonization&#13;
onward been profoundly marked by ethnic cleavages between the Indian populations&#13;
on one hand and the colonists and their descendants on the other. The distinc-&#13;
tion has been blurred with the passage of time, as persons of Indian, Spanish,&#13;
Portuguese and other origins intermarried, but the ethnic cleavage remains&#13;
relevant to this day where sizeable Indian communities exist. This concerns&#13;
particularly Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, but is of relevance&#13;
to all continental Spanish American countries with the exception of Panama,&#13;
the Caribbean, Costa Rica, Uruguay, and Argentina, where hardly any Indians&#13;
live today.&#13;
The second cleavage which is common to most countries in the world&#13;
is between urban and rural areas. Education and health services were developed&#13;
first in the towns and radiated only very gradually into the rural areas.&#13;
During colonial times a very small fraction of the population had access to&#13;
social services, which were overwhelmingly the responsibility of the Church.&#13;
After Independence Latin America went through a period of political turmoil&#13;
which lasted for over a century, during which little progress was achieved&#13;
in the provision of social services, except in the "Southern Cone" areas of&#13;
important nineteenth century European settlement (Argentina, southern Brazil,&#13;
Uruguay, and Chile). This turmoil lasted, in most of Latin America, until&#13;
the early (and in some countries, mid-) twentieth century, and retarded social&#13;
progress by undermining institution-building. Once education and (to a lesser&#13;
extent) health programs were allowed to develop owing to lessened political&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
insecurity, their progress focused essentially on the urban centers. Pre-war&#13;
efforts at extending education (and later health) to the rural areas were made&#13;
mainly in the areas of European settlement, and in Mexico, during the late&#13;
1930s, when the revolutionary aspects of the Constitution of 1917 were being&#13;
stressed. The remainder of Latin America had to await the post-war era and&#13;
particularly the 1950s and 1960s to witness the extension of public education&#13;
(and to a lesser extent) health facilities into the rural areas.&#13;
The urban/rural split has been aggravated by the very success that&#13;
Latin America experienced in developing nonagricultural activities. More than&#13;
in any other area of the developing world, cities grew at phenomenal rates in&#13;
Latin America. By 1970 the urban population made up more than 75 percent of&#13;
the total population in the Southern Cone area. In Mexico and Brazil the&#13;
share was near 60 percent. Between 1950 and 1970 the population of Brazil&#13;
and Mexico went up by 63 million persons; out of these, 50 million were added&#13;
to urban areas, or 80 percent of population growth.iI This enormous proportion&#13;
is not atypical for many countries in Latin America. In the face of such&#13;
powerful demands for social services on the part of the urban populations&#13;
rural expansion was given lower priority, even though some 40 percent of the&#13;
Region's population still live in rural areas.&#13;
In most of Latin America the center of gravity of political power&#13;
has shifted away from the rural areas and into urban areas, as a result of&#13;
urbanization and of the development of nonrural forms of activity. Thus&#13;
matters of national interest have come to be identified more and more with&#13;
the interests of the urban populations (or urban elites and middle classes).&#13;
The exclusion of the illiterate from voting in national elections (either&#13;
formally as in Brazil, Peru, and, until 1979, Ecuador, or informally as in&#13;
much of the rest of Latin America) combines with the phenomenal surge of&#13;
urbanization to bias the allocation of public education and health funds&#13;
overwhelmingly in favor of the cities. Until recently urban education and&#13;
health services were geared mainly to the needs of the middle classes, but as&#13;
these needs were satisfied in city after city, expansion of basic services&#13;
benefited more of the urban poor.&#13;
This left much of the rural areas backwaters of national life, except&#13;
for a few prosperous agricultural areas found mainly in the Southern Cone.&#13;
Rural politics, in the remainder of Latin America, became largely local&#13;
politics. Whether this "marginalization" of rural political power had an&#13;
effect on the welfare of the rural population cannot be stated with certainty.&#13;
In some cases the shift may have been beneficial; for example, in Peru the&#13;
opposition of many hacienda owners to the creation of primary schools has&#13;
been weakened considerably as their assets have become largely urban. In&#13;
some cases the shift may have been detrimental, as when the weak political&#13;
power the rural populations had been able to exert through their representatives&#13;
in the capital was weakened further. On the other hand, from a purely&#13;
financial point of view, the cost of extending basic education and health&#13;
services to the rural areas has clearly gone down sharply relative to resource&#13;
availabilities as the rural areas have been losing demographic weight. This&#13;
should make it less expensive than in the past to provide better social services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
in these areas. Together with the gradual saturation of basic social needs&#13;
in the cities and the natural tendency of national bureaucracies (including&#13;
those dealing with basic education and health) to expand their sphere of&#13;
activity, the relative cheapening of attacking the rural problem helps&#13;
explain recent initiatives in these areas.&#13;
The Present Situation&#13;
As in most developing regions in the world, the social conditions&#13;
of Latin America remain deeply influenced by the rural/urban cleavage. But&#13;
there may have been more progress in the urban areas than in other parts of&#13;
the developing world. In the absence of reliable aggregate statistics for&#13;
the Region this section focuses on the situation in a few countries. Latin&#13;
America can bw divided into four groups of countries. The first (Group A)&#13;
includes Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile (as well as the south of Brazil).&#13;
These areas have reached advanced levels of "basic needs satisfaction," and&#13;
can be found on most "social indicators scales" about three-quarters of the&#13;
way toward Canada, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The second group&#13;
(Group B) includes Costa Rica, Cuba, Panama, and most English-speaking&#13;
Caribbean countries. These countries have made particularly strong efforts&#13;
in education and health and have achieved impressive results without, however,&#13;
reaching the coverage of the first group in higher education. The third&#13;
(Group C) is the largest because it includes Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru,&#13;
and Venezuela. These countries have achieved considerable economic and&#13;
social success and clearly belong to the "middle-income countries," but they&#13;
are also dualistic, with very large differences in social coverage between&#13;
urban and rural areas and between Indian groups and the rest of the population.&#13;
The last group (Group D) of countries is predominantly rural, and is also&#13;
characterized by sharp differences between urban and rural social coverage.&#13;
It includes Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Paraguay,&#13;
as well as Haiti and the Dominican Republic. This last group of countries&#13;
has yet to provide full primary education coverage, but this problem also&#13;
remains in the rural areas of the third group of countries. In fact, except&#13;
for the absence of a fairly advanced urban sector, the countries in the last&#13;
group share the problems of the poorer rural areas in the third (and largest)&#13;
group. Thus, leaving aside the European settlement areas of the Southern&#13;
Cone, and a few countries in the second group, the bulk of Latin America can&#13;
be considered as one when dealing with the poorer rural areas. The following&#13;
table illustrates the dimensions of the problem in 1970:&#13;
Latin America and the Caribbean&#13;
Total Population    Rural Population  Urban-to-Rural Ratio&#13;
(million)           (million)&#13;
Groups A and B                50*                14             2.6 to 1&#13;
Group C                      190*                79              1.4 to 1&#13;
Group D                       34                 24              0.4 to 1&#13;
*Brazil is in Group C even though its Southern population should be included&#13;
in the first group. Countries with a population of under one million (1970)&#13;
are left out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 180 -&#13;
The table suggests that out of a total (1970) population of about 275 million,&#13;
a little over 100 million lived in rural areas of countries that are either&#13;
dualistic and/or among the poorest in the Region. The right-hand column provides&#13;
a guide to the degree of effort required for the modern (urban) part of society&#13;
to generate the means to improve the social conditions of the poorer (rural)&#13;
population. The following paragraphs try to present a picture of social&#13;
characteristics of these hundred million persons, drawing illustrations from&#13;
countries in Groups C as well as D.&#13;
The association between rural life and poor education and health&#13;
can be illustrated in many Latin American countries. The examples presented&#13;
here are from Brazil and Mexico, the Region's two most populou   countries.&#13;
More rigorous statistical evidence might be found in the State Census.volumes&#13;
but this is not needed to establish the point. The illiteracy rate was&#13;
25 percent in Brazil (1973) and 26 percent in Mexico (1970) for persons aged&#13;
15 and over. Among the larger states of Mexico, the following have the highest&#13;
rates of illiteracy (1970): Guerrero (48%), Oaxaca and Chiapas (46%), and&#13;
Hidalgo (42%). These are also the four states with the highest share of&#13;
rural population averaging 70 percent compared to a national share of 41 percent.&#13;
Conversely, the three entities with the lowest rates of illiteracy are the&#13;
Federal District and the States of Nuevo Le6n and Coahuila; these are also the&#13;
most urbanized parts of Mexico. Likewise, in Brazil the states of the Northeast&#13;
are characterized by the highest rates of illiteracy and are also the most&#13;
heavily rural as measured by the distribution of the population. Typically,&#13;
urban rates of illiteracy in the poorer rural states are five to six times&#13;
higher than in the major metropolitan areas and their surroundings, Of course&#13;
even in the poorer states, the situation is better than average for the urban&#13;
population. The situation is very similar in respect to health services.]./&#13;
Much of the rural population of Latin America lives in small isolated&#13;
villages. These' are reached only sporadically by government social service&#13;
administrations. Typically the inhabitants of these villages have access to&#13;
only one school room offering but a few grades of (low quality) tuition; they&#13;
also overwhelmingly lack the most elementary health facilities. The following&#13;
statistics for 1969 illustrate the situation vividly. They are drawn from an&#13;
inventory of public overhead in some 11,000 Mexican villages with a population&#13;
of 500 to 2,500, encompassing about half Mexico's rural population. There was&#13;
no classroom whatsoever in 34 percent of the villages. In the states of&#13;
Guerrero, Hidalgo, and Puebla more than 60 percent of the villages have no&#13;
classroom at all.4/&#13;
In only 14 percent of the villages was there a health post. And while&#13;
the (1970) number of persons per medical doctor in Mexico City was 474 (far&#13;
less than the national averages in France, the U.S., Sweden, and Switzerland),&#13;
in the state of Oaxaca there were 5,612 persons per doctor (a lesser coverage&#13;
than the national averages in Gabon, India, and Pakistan). The discrepancy&#13;
between urban and rural coverage is much higher in health than in education.&#13;
The situation in Mexico is not very different from that in the other countries&#13;
in Group C.5/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 181 -&#13;
In the less advanced countries (Group D) coverage of social services&#13;
is thinner still. In Guatemala, for example, in 1968 only 37 percent of the&#13;
primary-school-age population (7-14 years) regularly attended school, but&#13;
attendance was between 65% and 70% in urban areas, and about 20% in rural&#13;
areas; in many rural localities, there were no primary schools. Two-thirds&#13;
of rural schools did not offer more than the third grade. The rate of rural&#13;
illiteracy was over 75% for the rural working population of Guatemala, where&#13;
ethnic differences are an important fact of life. The provision of health&#13;
services to the rural population has also been minimal. Qre-half of the 325&#13;
municipalities in Guatemala lacked a health post in 1968.2/ Similarly, in&#13;
El Salvador, fewer than 20 percent of rural children reached the sixth grade&#13;
in 1976. Only 30 percent of rural schools offered fifth grade or higher&#13;
levels. About 50 percent of the population over age 25 is illiterate. The&#13;
health coverage is similarly poor in the rural areas. While in the department&#13;
of San Salvador, the capital city, there were 1,100 persons per doctor, there&#13;
were over 30,000 persons per doctor in four predominantly rural departments&#13;
(1976) .1"&#13;
These statistics should not be allowed to conceal the considerable&#13;
efforts which have been made duri-ng the post-war decades. In countries of&#13;
Group A progress has been aimed at "deepening" coverage in social services&#13;
while expanding them. In Group B coverage has increased rapidly, while&#13;
"deepening" was also achieved. The countries in Group C (encompassing the&#13;
bulk of Latin America's population) have also made considerable efforts at&#13;
improving both coverage and quality of social services. This progress is&#13;
indicated, for example, by the fall in the rate of illiteracy from older to&#13;
younger persons. In Brazil (1973) the rate falls steadily from 53 percent&#13;
for persons aged 70 and over and 31 percent for persons aged 40-49, to 19&#13;
percent (ages 25-29), 15 percent (ages 20-24), and 12 percent (ages 10-19).,/&#13;
However, because of rapid demographic expansion, and because of the cultural&#13;
and/or geographical isolation of the "core poverty groups," the absolute&#13;
number of illiterate persons aged 15 and over did not decline in Mexico&#13;
between 1960 and 1970 (some 6.7 million). Nor did the number of Brazilians&#13;
aged 5 and over without any formal schooling fall between 1950 and 1976&#13;
(29 and 31 million persons, respectively). At the same time the rate of&#13;
illiteracy in Mexico fell from 35 to 26 percent,i/ and the percentaae of&#13;
persons with no formal schooling in Brazil declined from 67 to 35.:U/ Public&#13;
health figures are likely to parallel these trends, judging by the declines&#13;
in overall infant mortality rates and the persistence of very high rates in&#13;
particular regions.&#13;
The following table shows how relative success has not been limited&#13;
to the more urbanized areas and has been impressive in some of the poorest&#13;
states of Mexico. It also shows, however, that the absolute number of illiterates&#13;
has not declined in the most urbanized states of Mexico (largely because of&#13;
the massive influx of migrants) and has declined only little in the poorest&#13;
states.&#13;

These trends in a country that has made a serious effort to expand coverage&#13;
clearly show the difficulties involved in improving coverage, especially in&#13;
the face of rapid urban growth. To some extent these trends reflect the rapid&#13;
demographic growth which in turn has led to a high proportion of school-age&#13;
children (42 percent of Latin Americans are under 15 years of age; in Peru the&#13;
proportion is as high as 48 percent).      In rural areas of heavy emigration&#13;
the ratio is even higher. This makes the task of educating the young incomparably&#13;
more difficult than in Europe in the nineteenth century, when the proportion of&#13;
young people was less than one half of the present-day Latin American levels,&#13;
and expectations may have been lesser.&#13;
The Future&#13;
The financial aspects of human resources improvements are dealt with&#13;
in a separate section. This section merely pulls together some of the main&#13;
forces and constraints that will continue to be at work in Latin America over&#13;
the next few decades. The discussion is limited to education but developments&#13;
in health and nutrition are unlikely to diverge from what occurs in education.&#13;
Throughout most of Latin America individual demands for education&#13;
are clearly strong. This is evidenced by a large number of private education&#13;
establishments at all levels, which are competing with public education. These&#13;
demands are also made clear by the prevalence across a wide spectrum of the&#13;
population of persons taking evening or other part-time courses, including&#13;
domestic servants. These courses often provide little more than a certificate&#13;
which may facilitate a modest degree of upward mobility. The "micro-economic"&#13;
demand for education is also illustrated in the rural areas of some countries&#13;
where a school teacher becomes the focal point of social and often political&#13;
mobilization against various forms of local monopolies or oligopolies, as&#13;
well as an important intermediary between the villagers and government&#13;
bureaucracy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 183 -&#13;
On a "macro-economic" level, the educational profile of the population&#13;
of any country is naturally closely related to the occupational structure of&#13;
the labor force. So, for example, while in Brazil 40 percent of the population&#13;
employed in agriculture had no formal schooling in 1973, only 11 percent of those&#13;
employed outside agriculture were in that situation; likewise, the proportion&#13;
of persons with secondary education was, respectively, 3 and 26 percent.13/&#13;
In Argentina 13 percent of those employed in agriculture had nc formal schooling,&#13;
but only 3.5 percent in manufacturing; similarly, only 5 percent of those&#13;
working in agriculture had one or more yearssecondary school, while 20 percent&#13;
of those worXing in the manufacturing sector had reached that level of formal&#13;
education. /&#13;
The following table shows a very simple illustrative projection based&#13;
on the relationships between sector of occupation and education in Brazil.&#13;
The (extreme) assumption is that no "human capital deepening" will occur in&#13;
each of the sectors of occupation; the difference between the figures for Brazil&#13;
and Argentina mentioned in the previous paragraph shows that this is unrealistic.&#13;
Therefore a second projection will sketch out what demands would be made on the&#13;
Brazilian education system if the educational structure within sectors were&#13;
to tend toward that of Argentina. But the first projection below is already&#13;
highly suggestive of the minimum demands for education. The only change between&#13;
the 1973 figures and those for "the future" is that the share of agriculture in&#13;
total employment declines from 40 to 25 percent. The proportion of persons&#13;
by levels of education within each of the two sectors of the economy is held&#13;
constant.&#13;

The right-hand column suggests that the simple structural shift from agriculture&#13;
to nonagricultural occupations alone would generate substantial demands for&#13;
secondary and university education. The increases in the proportion of the&#13;

total employed population that would be required is of 17 percent in secondary&#13;
education and 25 percent in university education. To achieve such an increase&#13;
in the total employed population requires far larger increases in educational&#13;
efforts, since nearly all the increase will concentrlate on younger persons.&#13;
The second projection brings "Brazil today" to the structure of&#13;
"Argentina today."&#13;

The demands on the educational system are somewhat stronger in this case,&#13;
especially at the higher levels (the share of the total employed population&#13;
with university education would rise from 4 to 6 percent). But the most striking&#13;
difference between the two projections is the considerable reduction in the&#13;
proportion of persons without any formal schooling involved in the shift between&#13;
"Brazil today" and "Argentina today."&#13;
The past trends are consistent with these projections. The pattern&#13;
in Latin American educational expansion can be gathered from the following table:&#13;
Enrollment Indexes (1960 = 100)11/&#13;

University                 318                     626&#13;
Much the strongest increases in enrollment have occurred at the university&#13;
level, followed at quite a distance by secondary enrollment. Primary enrollment&#13;
increased least of all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 185 -&#13;
The implications of these simple calculations are of great importance&#13;
for the future of human resources improvements in Latin America. The very&#13;
strong suggestion is that changes in the composition of the labor market&#13;
that go hand in hand with modernization are likely to put the greatest pressure&#13;
on secondary teacher training and university facilities. This is a characteristic&#13;
that has been much criticized in the past, yet which is quite consistent with&#13;
gradual structural changes and modernization. If the developments follow&#13;
these trends (and there are overwhelming reasons to believe that they should&#13;
as part and parcel of economic progress), then occupational shifts out of&#13;
agriculture will continue to be one of the most influential forces shaping&#13;
the demand for education. This means that migration to the cities and improve-&#13;
ments there will continue to dominate the scene, and, unless rural industries&#13;
develop at an unprecedented rate, rural education should be heavily geared&#13;
to prepare would-be migrants.&#13;
The implication of continued rural-urban migration on a large scale&#13;
is that it should become easier to reach high rates of education coverage as&#13;
more people live in the cities (where they can be educated more effectively).&#13;
The following arithmetic example suggests that even if rural coverage remains&#13;
constant and urban coverage increases gradually, the overall coverage will&#13;
increase substantially.&#13;

1990           30               50%            70              85%          74%&#13;
2000           25               50%            75              90%          80%&#13;
In some Latin American countries the rate of urbanization has been strong enough&#13;
to stabilize or reduce the absolute size of the rural population. As more&#13;
countries cross this thresh,old, rural education and health coverage can be&#13;
expanded with less additional effort. In this respect Latin America differs&#13;
from most developing regions in the world.&#13;
The implication is, then, that the "forces of development" will not&#13;
suffice to provide reasonably good education (and associated health and nutrition)&#13;
services to the bulk of the populations now residing in the rural areas, and&#13;
indeed that the "hard core" of rural poor may not benefit from better services&#13;
unless direct action on the part of the governments is intensified. It is&#13;
unclear, however, where the political forces that would be conducive to such&#13;
direct impact programs would be generated, since the potential beneficiaries&#13;
are most marginal in terms of political power and are likely to be considered&#13;
increasingly so with continued structural change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 186 -&#13;
Costs of Exanding Social Services&#13;
A number of recent World Bank and other reports have attempted to&#13;
quantify the costs of extending social services to the entire population of&#13;
various countries. These calculations are typically cast in the form of&#13;
projections. These projections include some assumptions about overhead costs&#13;
(central administration) and the multiplication of unit costs by the numbers&#13;
of individuals to be "covered." Generally, projections of this kind lead to&#13;
the conclusion that social services can be provided "cheaply" (in terms of&#13;
percentages of GNP) even when unit costs are computed very conservatively&#13;
(i.e., very high). Often, however, the same reports point to nonfinancial&#13;
problems that stand in the way of universal coverage, but fail to come to&#13;
terms with these problems -- essentially problems of "delivery" or "access."&#13;
The impression is often left, therefore, that political interests alone are&#13;
inhibiting the expansion of social services. And since political science&#13;
usually lies outside the stated realm of competence of the authors of such&#13;
papers, one is left with an uncomfortable feeling about their conclusions.&#13;
The low costs projected in such reports often contain two assumptions.&#13;
First, some form of fairly radical administrative change is often assumed&#13;
(barefoot doctors and their equivalents in education). Whether or not these&#13;
changes are acceptable to government bureaucracies, teachers' trade unions,&#13;
medical associations, etc. depends greatly on the circumstances of particular&#13;
societies. Unit costs may rise as the demand for qualified teachers and&#13;
medical personnel accelerates. Even where such changes are dncouraged by&#13;
government, they will usually occur on an experimental basis in the form&#13;
of pilot projects. Thus the pace at which the new systems will become a&#13;
significant part of the education and health bureaucracies becomes an important&#13;
question. Projections often are overoptimistic on the pace of extension of&#13;
new-style systems, and do not deal explicitly with problems such as the&#13;
acceptability of new systems (a) in rural areas so far not covered at all;&#13;
(b) in rural areas where the new and old systems would both exist at the same&#13;
time in different villages; and (c) in urban areas, usually in slums. Since&#13;
in most Latin American countries these new systems are quite recent (and are&#13;
indeed parts of pilot schemes), it is hard to assess the true cost of general-&#13;
izing them and is also very tempting to exaggerate the pace at which the new&#13;
systems can be expected to become more generalized. These enormous areas of&#13;
uncertainty allow for great variations in the projected costs of providing&#13;
universal services.&#13;
A second assumption commonly found in projections of this kind is&#13;
that of ceteris paribus.. New-style basic services are expanded while the&#13;
less basic services (secondary, vocational, university education; traditional&#13;
hospitals; urban facility improvements) are to grow only slowly if at all.&#13;
This ceteris paribus subsumes that the most powerful and vocal political&#13;
groups, i.e., the  haves," including particularly those persons who have only&#13;
just reached the lower rungs of the urban middle class and whose position on&#13;
the social ladder is still insecure, will accept a redirection of effort, if&#13;
it means a slow-down (or even, perhaps, only the slight attenuation of&#13;
acceleration) as far as the provision of social services to their families&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 187 -&#13;
is concerned. Far more likely, the government will be submitted to strong&#13;
pressures to continue improvements in "nonbasic" facilities on the part of&#13;
those who benefit from them. Thus, for every unit of additional expenditure&#13;
among the poor, it may be realistic to budget for several units of expenditure&#13;
for the improvement of "nonbasic" social services.&#13;
Finally, in Latin America public service strategies have as a rule&#13;
meant upgrading as well as expanding services, even in the rural areas. Countries&#13;
that have achieved very high coverage (e.g. Panama and Cuba) have clearly followed&#13;
a strategy of applying urban expenditure levels to rural areas. The importance&#13;
of large private education and health systems in most Latin American countries,&#13;
which compete with public services, may have reinforced the tendency on the&#13;
part of governments to strive at "more than basic" objectives.&#13;
Statistics on education and health unit costs are very poor. There-&#13;
fore it is not possible to support or refute "inexpensive projections"&#13;
unequivocally in the light of experience. Attachment Table 1 shows current&#13;
costs per primary school student by country in 1965 and 1975, and gross&#13;
primary school enrollment. The following matrix emerges.&#13;

With the exception of Guatemala, where unit costs were marginally&#13;
above the regional average, and Venezuela, where unit costs are high but&#13;
coverage (and increase in coverage) are not, the countries cluster into two&#13;
clear groups: those with high enrollment and high unit costs, and those with&#13;
low enrollment and low unit costs. Furthermore, in six out of eight countries&#13;
with high enrollment, unit costs have risen, over the period 1965-1975, faster&#13;
than average.  These associations are very far from statistical perfection but&#13;
they are consistent with the hypothesis that historically in Latin America and&#13;
the Caribbean wide coverage education services require substantially more&#13;
financial resources than poor ones. This is intuitively fairly obvious but&#13;
may be at variance with the "basic needs coverage" projections mentioned above.&#13;
These associations certainly do not rule out the possibility of profound&#13;
changes that might lead to the feasibility of low-cost adequate and comprehensive&#13;
education services, but merely suggest that until now there is no such experience&#13;
in Latin America on a scale large enough to influence overall cost figures.&#13;
Attachment Table 2 shows education expenditure (for all levels) as a share of&#13;
central government financial flows. While in some countries poor education&#13;
coverage absorbs a high share of government revenue (Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras,&#13;
Peru), in Costa Rica and Panama, where coverage is high both in urban and rural&#13;
areas, and the quality of education better than in most Latin American countries,&#13;
education absorbs the highest proportion of central government flows (some&#13;
37-40 percent of total tax revenue and, in Costa Rica, one third of total&#13;
central government expenditure as compared to an average, respectively,&#13;
of 24 and 19 percent for all countries on Attachment Table 2). In spite of&#13;
reasonably high tax revenues, Costa Rica and Panama have been facing frequent&#13;
fiscal problems.&#13;
Vocational training has also proved to be expensive if it is to be&#13;
effective. It involves expensive capital equipment (automotive, office&#13;
equipment, machine tools, etc.) This is probably why some of the most&#13;
effective vocational training schemes in Latin America are financed largely&#13;
out of earmarked industrial and commercial taxes rather than general government&#13;
revenues.&#13;
Nonformal education does not seem to offer an inexpensive solution&#13;
either. At the November 1976 Washington conference on the financing of&#13;
education in Latin America it was the consensus view that nonformal education&#13;
expansion runs into rising unit costs. This is attributed to (a) the need for&#13;
better and more dedicated teachers, implying higher salaries; (b) the need&#13;
for better materials, particularly printed materials; (c) the need for&#13;
better facilities (school rooms), and (d) the need for more central services&#13;
for coordination, supervision, etc.&#13;
Local communities might contribute more to financing education.&#13;
According to project experiences in Panama, Honduras, and Cuba, between 25&#13;
and 50 percent of operation and maintenance costs can be financed out of&#13;
community contributions; and 15 to 30 percent of capital costs can be financed&#13;
out of community contributions. Furthermore, between 25 and 50 percent of&#13;
operation and maintenance costs can be financed out of surplus from sales&#13;
of goods produced at school.   However, in practice school farms have not been&#13;
successful in Latin America because of low levels of technology and competence.16/&#13;

A further (and perhaps more feasible) source of financing is the&#13;
ixtroduction of private fees in secondary and higher education institutions,&#13;
for students whose parents can afford to pay.&#13;
At a recent conference on the costs and financing of education&#13;
(Mexico, November-December 1978) a calculation was presented of the scope&#13;
for private financing of education (by substituting fees to government&#13;
financing) and of the increase in the public education budget required to&#13;
provide broader primary coverage. The results are s = ed up in the following&#13;
table:&#13;

as a result of&#13;
payment of secondary&#13;
and university fees&#13;
Since Latin American countries typically spend 3 to 4 percent of GNP on public&#13;
education, making up 15 to 20 percent of central government expenditure, this&#13;
table suggests that especially in the least advanced countries the costs of&#13;
universal coverage are quite substantialt even for a goal as modest as four&#13;
years' primary school for all children.1 / Furthermore, the scope for substi-&#13;
tuting private fees for public financing is narrowest in the countries that&#13;
require the greatest increase in expenditure. These findings are consistent&#13;
with the historical record outlined earlier, and with the hypothesis put&#13;
forward at the beginning of this section, which is likely to apply in health&#13;
as well as in education.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Bussink treats human development as one
            strand in a broad discussion of issues bearing on poverty in
            East Asian countries. Davies presents an overview of poverty
            in Sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on selected human
            development issues: these include the relation between
            higher and middle level manpower and institutional
            development on the one hand and the human development of the
            poor on the other. Grawe emphasizes questions of population
            growth and the status of women in South Asia and stresses
            the efficiency of education and health systems, as well as
            reallocation of expenditures within human development areas
            toward more basic programs having a larger impact on the
            poor. Kavalsky also pays attention to fertility and the
            large disparity between males and females in the Middle East
            and North Africa, including the effect of migration on
            poverty. He also illustrates how human development can lag
            behind natural-resource-based income growth: that is, how
            human and institutional development takes time even where
            there are no serious financial constraints, as in some of
            the oil-exporting countries of the region. Pfeffermann
            focuses on some educational issues in Latin America and on
            the more general question of the difficulty of reaching the
            poorest groups with human development programs.
