        <abstracts>
            In the 1990s, the Socialist Republic of
            Vietnam formulated a new policy, strategy, and program to
            meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and national
            targets to improve rural water supply and sanitation. While
            progress in water supply increased rapidly, progress in
            sanitation lagged behind. By 1998, just 24 percent of rural
            Vietnamese households had sanitary toilets, placing the
            achievement of MDG targets for sanitation by 2015 at risk.
            The study provides valuable insights to practitioners
            working on projects related to sanitation marketing.
