INDIA&#13;
SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:           India, acting by its President.&#13;
Beneficiaries:       Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) and Madras Metropolitan Water Supply&#13;
and Sewerage Board (MMWSSB).&#13;
Amount:              IBRD Loan: US$275.8 million equivalent.&#13;
Terms:               Loan repayable in 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at standard variable&#13;
interest rate.&#13;
On-Lending Terms:  Government of India (GOI) to GOTN: As part of the central assistance to States&#13;
for development projects on terms and conditions applicable at the time.&#13;
GOTN to MMWSSB: Not less than 13.5% per annum rate of interest with&#13;
repayment over 20 years, including 5 years of grace of both principal and&#13;
interest.&#13;
GOI would bear the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Project Objectives    Madras has the lowest level of water supply of all metropolitan areas in India&#13;
and Description:     and great susceptibility to drought. The project's major objectives are to: (a)&#13;
provide water from a reliable source within the State to Madras on an urgent&#13;
basis; (b) improve the distribution of water within Madras; and (c) strengthen&#13;
conservation.&#13;
The project would consist of the following: (a) source works at the existing&#13;
Veeranam irrigation tank to the south of Madras; (b) a transmission pipeline&#13;
from Veeranam to Madras, a distance of 235 km, with associated treatment and&#13;
pumping facilities which will supply 180 million liters per day or about 38% of&#13;
existing supplies to the city, and resettlement and rehabilitation of persons&#13;
displaced on the right of way; (c) continuation of distribution improvements&#13;
within Madras being undertaken in the First Madras Water Supply Project (LN&#13;
2846/CR. 1822-IN); (d) a water conservation program including physical works&#13;
such as leak detection and repairs and tariff increases to encourage more&#13;
efficient use of water; and (e) technical assistance in the form of project&#13;
preparation and implementation support. Adequate steps would be taken to&#13;
ensure people adversely affected benefit from the project where this is possible&#13;
and otherwise are made no worse off as a result. To remove possible farmer&#13;
resistance to the proposals at Veeranam, a new regime to regulate the flow has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv-&#13;
been introduced following consultation under which the irrigation flows would&#13;
exceed those that would otherwise have occurred.&#13;
Benefits:             The major direct benefits of the project would be the provision of: (a) an&#13;
improved level of water supply service; (b) a more equitable distribution of&#13;
water; (c) improved conservation of water; and (d) financial and institutional&#13;
strengthening of the MMWSSB with the result of achieving better management&#13;
of services. These direct benefits would yield secondary benefits of health,&#13;
convenience to consumers, improved economic performance by the city's&#13;
industries and reduced over-exploitation of the shallow aquifers by substituting&#13;
piped supplies for private abstractions.&#13;
Risks:                The major risks likely to face the project are: (a) the capability of the water&#13;
entities in Tamil Nadu to successfully construct the transmission main; (b)&#13;
popular resistance to tariff increases that would be necessary to ensure the&#13;
satisfactory financing of the project; and (c) additionally, a risk considered&#13;
small, of failure of the source in an extremely bad drought year or sequence of&#13;
years to provide the planned volume of water. The capacity of the entities would&#13;
be addressed by careful engineering preparation using international consultants&#13;
and by the decision to assign experienced consultants, also international, to&#13;
supervise the construction phase, and by stringent pre-qualification of&#13;
contractors. Concerning tariffs, GOTN has been in compliance during the First&#13;
Project with financial covenants which have required substantial tariff increases&#13;
including an increase of about 250% on April 1, 1994.&#13;

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
I. WATER SUPPLY SECTOR OVERVIEW&#13;
1.1    Some 217 million people in India live in urban areas (1991 census) and nearly 60% of India's&#13;
Net Domestic Product is generated in its towns and cities. Forecasts by the United Nations suggest that&#13;
the urban population may grow by over 400 million up to the year 2025. Urban growth is placing great&#13;
strain on already under-provided urban infrastructure and services, especially water supply. There is an&#13;
urgent need for sustainable modes of delivery which must be compatible with, and meet the requirements&#13;
of a market-oriented economy while providing efficient and effective safety nets of protection for the&#13;
urban poor.&#13;
A.    Water Supply Sector Development and Organization&#13;
1.2    Service Levels in Urban India. In 1992 the proportion of the Indian urban population receiving&#13;
water supply was 85% with approximately two-thirds served by private connections and one-third by&#13;
standposts. Coverage figures alone are an inadequate indicator of the status of the water supply sector,&#13;
however, and mask the issues of the level of service. In most Indian cities, supplies to the consumer are&#13;
intermittent and are frequently reduced to as little as two hours a day, often at very low pressures. This&#13;
has implications for the quality of water received by the consumer and increases the risk of health-&#13;
threatening contamination as a result of back-flow in the poorly maintained distribution systems.&#13;
Intermittent supplies to industrial consumers also have serious economic implications for production&#13;
particularly in water-intensive industries, such as petro-chemicals, which invest heavily in their own&#13;
sources, storage and pumping equipment.&#13;
1.3    Sector Organization at National and State Levels. Under India's constitution, the primary&#13;
responsibility for water supply rests with the states. Central Government influences the sector through&#13;
approvals of state development plans and through operations of central level institutions. The central&#13;
focal point is the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment. Central Government provides technical&#13;
reviews of major investment proposals from the states and guidance on design standards, coordination of&#13;
training and support for funding institutions such as the Housing and Urban Development Corporation of&#13;
India (HUDCO).&#13;
1.4    Within the framework set by Central Government, state governments determine the policies for&#13;
the water supply sector and influence sector developments through the processes of regulation of sector&#13;
agencies and resource allocations from state budgets. It is common for state governments in India to&#13;
have established special purpose entities to provide the planning, design and construction of water supply&#13;
and sanitation infrastructure. In Tamil Nadu this is with the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage&#13;
Board (TWAD). Municipalities in India are the primary local bodies responsible for providing water&#13;
supply in urban areas though for a few of the larger cities, including Madras, special purpose entities&#13;
have been established. In Madras this is the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board&#13;
(MMWSSB, sometimes referred to as Madras MetroWater).&#13;
1.5    Tamil Nadu is located in the south of India and ranks seventh in state population and eleventh in&#13;
area. Madras is the State's capital, and the nation's fourth largest metropolitan area. The population of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Madras Metropolitan Area (MMA) is 5.9 million (1991 census) which includes the Madras&#13;
Metropolitan Corporation (MMC) with 3.8 million and surrounding jurisdictions covering six municipal&#13;
areas, three municipal townships, 27 town panchayats, 10 panchayat unions and one contonment board&#13;
which together, amount to 2.1 million. Madras is an administrative and commercial center and has a&#13;
number of industries including the port, textiles, electrical equipment, machinery and vehicles with&#13;
petro-chemical and fertilizer industries in north Madras.&#13;
1.6    Existing Sources and Distribution in Madras. Water supply for Madras is currently obtained&#13;
from ground water sources, about 13 in number depending on how they are categorized into groups, and&#13;
three inter-connected reservoirs at Poondi, Cholavaram and Redhills. A recent survey of consumers has&#13;
found that many have their own supplies of groundwater obtained from shallow wells which, for the&#13;
domestic sector, are used for washing and cleaning purposes leaving the piped supply for drinking and&#13;
cooking. There has been underinvestment in the water distribution system for many years, leading to&#13;
poor coverage, inequitable distribution and considerable wastage through leakage and abuse.&#13;
1.7   Existing Level of Service in Madras. The maximum availability of water for Madras from&#13;
existing sources is about 290 mid which provides an average for areas covered of about 70&#13;
liters/capita/day (Ipcd) inclusive of demands by industry and other non-domestic consumers. The&#13;
corresponding figures for other cities are Bombay 253, Delhi 220, Calcutta 190 and Bangalore 125 Ipcd,&#13;
making Madras the lowest-supplied metropolitan area in India. The average per capita domestic daily&#13;
availability in Madras is only 47 liters which is well below the Indian standard of 70-100 lpcd for&#13;
individual connections in urban areas and 50 Ipcd for consumers using stand pipes.&#13;
1.8   In poor monsoon years, the water supply is reduced to periods of one to three hours on alternate&#13;
days. Occasionally this low level of supply for domestic use can only be maintained by diversion of&#13;
industrial water supply requiring industries to curtail or even cease their operations. Failure of the&#13;
monsoon combined with the practice of overdrawing the reservoir system has in the past resulted in&#13;
almost complete depletion of the storage reservoirs.&#13;
1.9   TWAD. With the exception of the MMA, the State-wide responsibility for planning, design and&#13;
construction of water supply and sewerage systems rests with TWAD. This organization was established&#13;
in 1971 for the purpose of regulating and developing drinking water and drainage investments. TWAD&#13;
has no responsibility for irrigation which has rested with the irrigation wing of the State Government's&#13;
Public Works Department (PWD), reorganized in early 1995 into the Water Resources Organization&#13;
(WRO). Generally, after commissioning, TWAD hands projects over to local bodies for operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M). TWAD is the oldest board of this type in the country and has well developed&#13;
policies and procedures.&#13;
1.10   MMWSSB.   MMWSSB was formed as an autonomous body in 1978, and assumed sector&#13;
responsibilities formerly held by MMC. Over time its jurisdiction has extended to the MMA.&#13;
MMWSSB is a state agency, with the Chairman and Managing Director appointed by the State&#13;
Government. The Secretary to Government for Municipal Administration and Water Supply and other&#13;
senior secretaries are its directors. MMWSSB is organized in six separate sections for management&#13;
purposes: water supply and sewerage construction; operations; resource planning, project planning and&#13;
design; finance, accounting and internal audit; personnel and administration; and, inventory control and&#13;
purchasing. The total current labor force is 3,950, which has fallen since 1978 from 6,878. MMWSSB&#13;
is generally a well run utility and over the years has expanded its management systems to include&#13;
performnance budgeting and cost centers. MMWSSB has also computerized its billing and collection,&#13;
budgeting and planning. As at August 1994, there were 220,000 consumers of which 10, 000,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
predominantly industrial and commercial consumers, were metered. There are 7,554 stand pipes in the&#13;
city serving 1.8 million people.&#13;
B.    Strategies of Governments&#13;
1.11   Central Government. A national water policy document produced by the GOI's Ministry of&#13;
Water Resources in 1987 provided clear guidelines in the allocation of priorities, stating that drinking&#13;
water would be top priority in the planning and operation of water systems. It stressed that with the&#13;
increasing scarcity of water, "optimal, economical and equitable use has become a matter of the utmost&#13;
urgency". Consistent with this approach, strategies identified in India's Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97)&#13;
include: (a) management of water as a commodity, as with any other resource; (b) the need to charge&#13;
appropriate tariffs to cover O&amp;M and development costs where appropriate; (c) encouragement of the&#13;
private sector to develop water supply projects; (d) reduction of pollution by provision of appropriate&#13;
treatment facilities for waste and sewage; and (e) separation of the water supply and sanitation budget&#13;
from general municipal budgets for better planning, monitoring and control. Water resource&#13;
management has become an emerging feature of Central Government's strategy since the start of the&#13;
Eighth Plan. However, there is still a major gap between strategy and practice on the ground.&#13;
1.12   State Governments. While many States recognize the importance of adopting Central&#13;
Government strategies for the sector, these still need to be addressed with appropriate policies and&#13;
actions. Significant reform in the sector is taking place in only a few states, including Tamil Nadu. A&#13;
State Water Policy paper was issued by GOTN in 1994 which is consistent with GOI's paper. Tamil&#13;
Nadu was the first state to prepare such a paper. Major sector issues which need to be addressed in the&#13;
context of the project are indicated below.&#13;
C.    Sector Issues&#13;
1.13   Water Resource Management. There is a need for coherent state water resource policies&#13;
incorporating planning of river basins and covering all uses, as spelt out in the Bank's policy paper,&#13;
Water Resources Management (1993) which was discussed by the Board in May, 1993. State agencies,&#13;
including the irrigation departments, special agencies like TWAD and the municipalities need to have&#13;
greater regard to improvements in financial, managerial and technical performance; more autonomy, and&#13;
increased user involvement in management matters. A proposed Bank project, the Tamil Nadu Water&#13;
Resources Consolidation Project, would support initiatives in the State to introduce multi-sectoral water&#13;
plann;ng based on river basins, and to strengthen the State's institutional and technical capability in&#13;
water development, management and planning. It would build on the Tamil Nadu Drinking Water&#13;
Supply Sector Plan Study which has just been completed under the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Project (see para. 1.20). It is recognized that growing needs of urban centers are likely&#13;
increasingly to dominate investment choices. The importance of these choices is reflected in the&#13;
establishment of an apex "Water Resources Control and Review Council" as the State's most senior&#13;
body, chaired by the Chief Minister and with three other key Ministers as Vice Chairmen. TWAD and&#13;
MMWSSB are represented in the Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.14   Water Conservation. The demand for additional urban water supply infrastructure and&#13;
services arises from the accommodation of growth and from existing deficiencies in either coverage or&#13;
service levels, or both. In most urban areas there is an overriding need to increase the quantity of piped&#13;
water to consumers in order to reduce intermittent supplies and low pressures. This requires additional&#13;
sources and strengthened and enlarged distribution systems. Such improvements require a combination&#13;
of superior organization to facilitate these changes, better mobilization of resources to pay for them,&#13;
greater attention to the quality of construction, operation and maintenance of assets, and measures to&#13;
conserve water including appropriate tariff structures and levels. The proposed project addresses these&#13;
concerns and has a component which reflects these requirements for conservation of water including&#13;
metering, leak detection and repair and progressive introduction of tariff reforms.&#13;
1.15   Cost Recovery and Institutional Strengthening. Inadequate cost recovery is a major&#13;
constraint to improved sector performance. Raising the level of cost recovery requires the establishment&#13;
of effective systems of charging for water and sewerage. Such charges will only be effective if based on&#13;
the volume of water consumed, with proportional charges for sewerage. Linked to a system of&#13;
continuous supply at acceptable pressures, it becomes technically possible to organize the charging&#13;
system on a volumetric basis and while this principle is widely accepted in India these systems of&#13;
charging do not exist fully in any of the larger Indian towns or cities. A fully metered system of supply&#13;
would permit greater control over leakage, waste and other forms of unaccounted for water, encourage&#13;
effective conservation and would reduce operating costs. Financial strengthening is one element of&#13;
institutional strengthening, and is important for preparation of entities for corporatization. Improved&#13;
engineering, accounting and management procedures are also required. Again, the proposed project&#13;
builds on actions already being unidertaken to support these requirements by incorporating progressive&#13;
metering, a move to full volumetric charging and substantial tariff increases.&#13;
1.16   Construction Quality. Througlhout the sector, the quality of construction of new works is&#13;
extremely poor. Many local authority staff are insufficiently qualified or experienced for the tasks.&#13;
Relationships between local authority engineers and contractors are invariably strained and the use of&#13;
qualified consultants is limited. Poorly managed procurement procedures for goods, works and services&#13;
remain a major problem throughout the sector. Preparation of tender documents and evaluation of&#13;
tenders are slow. The common practice of fragmentation of works into a large number of contracts is&#13;
wasteful in administrative time and r esults in difficulties of coordination and management. The&#13;
proposed project would include major project components and would bring international expertise to the&#13;
tasks of their design and supervision.&#13;
1.17   Links to Environmental Sanitation. The provision of sanitation arrangements must go hand in&#13;
hand with water supply. Increasing the supply of water will have a consequential impact on the disposal&#13;
of wastes. In most Indian cities there is a wide gap between the level of water service and the even more&#13;
serious situation with inadequate sanitation and the outcome has been a segmental approach. As a result,&#13;
the discharges of waste leads to pollution, health risks and environmental degradation. These problems&#13;
are exacerbated by poor maintenance of drainage channels where much of the waste is routed. Although&#13;
the proposed project does not have a sanitation component, this is an important part of MMWSSB's&#13;
investment program under the existing Bank First Project (see para. 1.20), and under a future project&#13;
proposal (see para. 2.2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D.    Lessons Learned from the Bank's Involvement in the Sector&#13;
1.18   Bank's Prior Experience in India. The Bank Group began supporting urban water supply and&#13;
sanitation projects in India in 1974 and through to the end of FY1994 had approved twelve projects,&#13;
which account for US$814 million in IDA Credits and US$173 million in World Bank Loans. Most of&#13;
the further eleven urban development projects accounting for US$990 million and US$69 million&#13;
respectively Credits and Loans, have contained substantial components of water supply and sanitation&#13;
investments. A schedule of these projects is in Annex 9. Of the twelve urban water supply and&#13;
sanitation projects, five have been single city projects mainly in the metropolitan cities.&#13;
1.19   Experience has been that the physical works financed by the Bank Group have been&#13;
implemented in a satisfactory manner although some implementation delays have been experienced in&#13;
most cases. Past projects have been less than fully successful in achieving institutional, financial or&#13;
economic improvements, which have focused on management information systems, accounting and the&#13;
achievement of full or substantial cost recovery. Failure to implement agreed initiatives within projects&#13;
has contributed to inefficiencies, inadequate cost recovery and insufficient financing of O&amp;M. The&#13;
institutional reforms have not always been thoroughly developed or properly presented. Realistic&#13;
schedules have not always been planned, nor coordinated with the training and other technical assistance&#13;
needed to facilitate the changes. Nevertheless, there is growing acceptance by the Government of India&#13;
(GOI) and many state governments of the fundamental objectives incorporated in the Bank's sector&#13;
program. The main lessons learned are the need for: (a) use of legal covenants where the action is&#13;
critical to project success; (b) greater flexibility and use of operational action plans to be revised in the&#13;
light of changing conditions; (c) greater attention to project preparation prior to project effectiveness;&#13;
(d) persistent supervision; and (e) the active participation by central and state governments and agencies&#13;
as policy intermediaries for biringing about the necessary reforms in the sector framework.&#13;
1.20   Bank's Prior Experience in the Sector in Tamil Nadu and Madras. The Bank is funding one&#13;
on-going water supply and sanitation project in Madras, (the First Madras Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Project (LN. 2846/CR. 1822-IN) or the First Project) and has funded the recently completed Tamil Nadu&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Project (CR. 1454-IN). CR. 1454-IN in the amount of US$73 million&#13;
equivalent (Board date of March 1984 and final closing date of December 1994) met its development&#13;
objectives with substantial compliance of major covenants. There was a need for design changes and&#13;
project restructuring in 1990 because of prolonged drought which extended the original closing date from&#13;
June 1990 to December 1994. The First Project in the amount of US$69 million equivalent, for which&#13;
the Board date was June 1987 with a closing date of December 1995, should meet its development&#13;
objectives with the exception of a full 35% increase in the supply of water for Madras. Less than full&#13;
supply arises from delays in the construction of some check dams and lower than expected yields from&#13;
existing well fields due to the impact of the drought which has affected the region since the early 1980s.&#13;
Implementation has been satisfactory and legal covenants, including financial performance, are in&#13;
compliance.&#13;
E.    Bank's Sector Role&#13;
1.21   Bank support to the urban water supply sector is dependent on commitments by central and state&#13;
governments to reform. In the medium term, Bank lending would be in areas where progress has been&#13;
made in dealing with sector constraints and where there is clear sign of reform effort. The Bank's&#13;
strategy has been to seek: (al) the efficient utilization of resources through appropriate technology&#13;
choices and sound engineering design and construction; (b) an improvement in institutional capacity;&#13;
(c) pricing policies which ericourage conservation of water yet which render services affordable to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
poor while ensuring adequate financing of current expenditures and the production of internally&#13;
generated funds for further investment; (d) the development of water resource planning; and (e) in the&#13;
medium term, the "commercialization" of water utilities and the involvement of the private sector. The&#13;
proposed project would be consistent with all these strategic aims.&#13;
II.    THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Origin and Rationale for Bank Support&#13;
2.1    Proposed Sources of Supply. The water shortage in Madras will continue until large sources of&#13;
supply are developed. The severity of the water shortage is apparent when comparing theoretical water&#13;
demand with quantities of water that are available or likely to become available in the foreseeable future.&#13;
The main new sources are the proposed Project, which is based on the Cauvery River as a source to the&#13;
south of Madras, and the development of a source of supply based on the Krishna River located in the&#13;
State of Andhra Pradesh to the north. Works are currently underway (not financed by the Bank) to&#13;
provide water by new canal and dam investments from the Krishna River which will supply the Madras&#13;
reservoir system. Krishna water will feed into Redhills from late 1995 or early 1996, where a treatment&#13;
plant is under construction under the First Project, and the water will enter the Madras distribution&#13;
system directly from the Redhills treatment plant. The estimated "theoretical" requirement for the&#13;
metropolitan area is some 1750 mld sometime after the turn of the century assuming demand of some&#13;
200 lpcd. The current project will supply 180 mid and the Krishna project is expected to supply about&#13;
400 mld in the first phase rising later to 930 mld. The overall availability is summarized in Table 2. 1,&#13;
which shows that, even after the proposed supply augmentations, there will remain significant overall&#13;
shortfalls, exceeding some 600 mid.&#13;
Table 2.1: Estimated Water Requirements &amp; Supplies'&#13;
Estimated Net Theoretical Demand  =  I170SAlm&#13;
Current Sources                 =   290 mid&#13;
Veeranam Project                =   180 mid&#13;
Krishna - I st phase                400 mld&#13;
Krishna - later phases              530 mld&#13;
1400 mld&#13;
Less losses in distribution at 20%    = 280 mld&#13;
Remaining Overall Shortfall     =   630 mld&#13;
At about the time that the proposed project will be completed, after year 2000.&#13;
2.2    The Investment Program for Madras Water Supply. The ongoing First Project is resulting in&#13;
strengthening of the distribution system in the city and reducing waste. The priority now is to provide&#13;
more water while continuing with the distribution improvements and waste reduction. This Second&#13;
Madras Water Supply Project (the Second Project) is seen by the GOTN as an "interim" project to supply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
much needed additional water through a 235 km long pipeline from the Veeranam irrigation tank to&#13;
alleviate the chronic shortage and to continue the work of distribution strengthening. It is proposed to&#13;
complete the work of the First and Second Projects to strengthen the distribution system, undertake&#13;
conservation measures and improve waste management in a Third Project which is under preparation.&#13;
Thus, the present Second Project must be viewed as part of a continuum of work, linking together the&#13;
First and Third Projects. From Table 2.1 it is clear that although Veeranam is a modest component of the&#13;
long-term supply, it adds 38 percent to current supply. Annex I provides descriptions of the First and&#13;
Third Projects.&#13;
2.3    There was an earlier scheme (not financed by the Bank) to bring water to Madras from the&#13;
Veeranam tank in the 1970s but this was abandoned shortly after the start of implementation due to&#13;
technical difficulties arising from the design. The current project uses basically the same transmission&#13;
concept as this earlier scheme and, for this reason, is sometimes referred to as the New Veeranam&#13;
Project. However, there are important design and implementation management changes to ensure&#13;
successful completion.&#13;
2.4    Rationale and Link to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Following the achievement of&#13;
many of the objectives of structural reform at the Center, priority of the CAS (draft of March 14, 1995, to&#13;
be reviewed by Board in June 1995) places priority on implementing state-level sector reforms and&#13;
improving state finances. These are essential if state governments are to play their key role in the&#13;
provision of critically needed infrastructure. The lending strategy should reflect the requirements and&#13;
characteristics of individual states. The proposed project is consistent with this priority. Through&#13;
increasing the supply of water to the city of Madras, the opportunity for sector reform is increased. The&#13;
project enhances the drive for financial strengthening of MMWSSB and the program of water&#13;
conservation. The project improves the framework and environment for private sector-led economic&#13;
growth by strengthening the public sector's effectiveness in providing an essential service.&#13;
B.    Objectives&#13;
2.5    The proposed Second Project would increase the supply of water to Madras and would lead to&#13;
significant improvements in distribution and conservation with consequential benefits for the population,&#13;
economy and the environment. The Bank's involvement would be to assist with the financing of the&#13;
works and development and of providing the stimulus for needed conservation measures and financial&#13;
discipline. The project would safeguard the interests of persons adversely affected by the project.&#13;
2.6    The major project objectives are to:&#13;
(a)    provide water to Madras on an urgent basis;&#13;
(b)    improve the distribution of water within Madras; and&#13;
(c)    strengthen conservation of water through physical means such as leakage detection and&#13;
repair and the introduction of revised water tariffs and other measures.&#13;
C.    Project Description&#13;
2.7    Overview of the Project. The Second Project would exploit part of the yield of an existing&#13;
agricultural water source, the Veeranam tank, which is a shallow balancing reservoir formed by earth&#13;
embankments on the Cauvery River system. The Veeranam tank is supplied from the Mettur Reservoir&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
located on the Tamil Nadu side of the border with Karnataka through a complex series of channels and&#13;
weirs and from its own and other catchment areas. Infrastructure would be constructed under the project&#13;
to increase the capacity of the Veeranam tank which, with additional releases from Mettur and a new&#13;
operating regime at Veeranam, would remove any impact of withdrawing water from the irrigation&#13;
system which serves local farmers. From the Veeranam tank raw water would be pumped and&#13;
transported by pipeline to a treatment plant at Vadakkuthu some 20 km away. Thereafter, the treated&#13;
water would be transported by pipeline to Madras to a terminal reservoir to be provided at Porur, in the&#13;
south-west of the city. The overall distance from Veeranam to Porur is about 235 km. 192 mid will be&#13;
withdrawn on a continuous basis from the Veeranam tank, of which 180 mid would reach Madras with&#13;
about 4% used in operating the treatment plant and 2% losses along the transmission line. From Porur&#13;
the treated water would be pumped to the city's distribution system. A project component is included to&#13;
continue the improvement of the distribution system which is underway using Bank assistance under the&#13;
First Project and also using HUDCO's financing. To the extent financially and technically feasible,&#13;
distribution system improvements in the proposed project would be targeted at lower income areas of the&#13;
city. In addition, water conservation improvements would be achieved by MMWSSB through revisions&#13;
of water tariffs linked to a metering program and physical works which are part of a distribution system&#13;
strengthening strategy.&#13;
2.8    Component 1: Source Works (US$22.1 million; 6.8 percent of base cost). Veeranam tank is an&#13;
ancient source of irrigation water for the surrounding region. The bund has been formed by a three to&#13;
four meter earthen embankment nearly 16 km long and a foreshore bund which is 9 km long. Its present&#13;
3                                          2&#13;
storage capacity is 27.7 Mm  and the water surface area of the tank is 20.8 km . The proposed major&#13;
engineering works include: raising the Veeranam bund by about 0.6 m by excavating accumulated silt&#13;
from the floor of the tank, and transporting, placing and consolidating this material to form new&#13;
embankments or to repair existing embankments; the construction of a parapet wall and other works for&#13;
prevention of wave erosion; restoration of the existing bunds; construction of a short length of new&#13;
foreshore bund to prevent submergence of land due to the raising of the reservoir, and the necessary&#13;
modifications to weirs and the spill-way. Additionally, there will be lining improvements to the&#13;
principal canal which serves the tank, the Vadavar Channel, and minor irrigation works as part of the&#13;
effort to safeguard the interests of local farmers. There will be limited displacement of population on the&#13;
embankments and nearby for which a program of compensation and reinstatement has been agreed (see&#13;
Annex 6).&#13;
2.9    Component 2: Water Transmission, Treatment and Resettlement (US$229.4 million: 70.4&#13;
percent). Construction is proposed of: a raw water intake and pumping station; rehabilitation of existing&#13;
underground storage facilities and construction of an additional storage tank; and, the laying of a&#13;
transmission main for the raw water from the tank to the treatment plant of 180 mid capacity at&#13;
Vadakkuthu. The structure for the treatment plant, constructed as part of the 1970s scheme but&#13;
abandoned, would be renovated and new mechanical and electrical equipment installed. Thereafter there&#13;
would be the laying of a single transmission main between 1525 and 1875 mm in diameter to convey the&#13;
water to Porur. The clear water would be pumped from Vadakkuthu to a high level transmission&#13;
reservoir at Kadam Pulliyar Ridge from where it would flow by gravity. There will be displacement of&#13;
encroachers on the right of way, and on road margins in Madras. As for the Source Works, a&#13;
compensation relocation and rehabilitation program has been agreed so as to ensure the restoration or&#13;
enhancement of their standard of living up to or above levels enjoyed by them prior to the&#13;
commencement of the implementation of the project (Annex 6). Operationally the project treatment of&#13;
resettlement will be as an integral part of the transmission works, but given the nature of the&#13;
expenditures to be incurred the costs are included under Component 5 of the project cost tables (Annex&#13;
13). A map showing the location of transmission and treatment proposals is provided at IBRD 26858.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.10   The transmission pipeline will not be used for the supply of water to communities along the&#13;
right-of-way. It would not be economic to serve local communities as the water in the transmission main&#13;
will have been raised to high pressure in order that it will reach Madras, which would be too high for&#13;
water supply systems for small communities. TWAD, in association with local bodies, will be&#13;
undertaking a number of small water supply schemes in parallel with thie construction of the pipeline for&#13;
these communities which is a more economical solution. To remove as far as possible the chances of&#13;
disruption of supply due to illegal interference, and to maintain access to lands behind road margins, it is&#13;
proposed to lay and cover the pipeline in a trench for virtually its whole length. It will be supported&#13;
above ground at river and other crossings and in marshy areas.&#13;
2.11   Component 3: City Distribution (US$32.5 million; 10.0 percent). A terminal reservoir and&#13;
pumping station would be constructed at Porur. The works associated with improvements to the&#13;
distribution system will continue those of the First Project. The works would involve improvement to&#13;
the Porur-Volluvar Kottam distribution main and development of six distribution centers as part of a 16&#13;
zone system.&#13;
2.12   Component 4: Water Conservation (US$31.5 million; 9.7 percent). There will be a clearly&#13;
defined program for the successive rehabilitation of the distribution zones including leak detection and&#13;
repairs, replacements, strengthening and bulk and consumer metering. There would be progressive&#13;
introduction of comprehensive coverage of domestic metering in each zone. The program of water&#13;
conservation will include tariff increases to bring about more efficient use of water by consumers,&#13;
particularly domestic consumers who are not presently metered. The tariff increases will be required to&#13;
satisfy the financing plan and, specifically, MMWSSB's need to generate funds for its share of the&#13;
investment financing requirements (see D below). A map showing the location of distribution and&#13;
conservation measures in the city under Components 3 and 4 is provided as IBRD 26865.&#13;
2.13   Component 5: Technical Assistance for Project Preparation and Implementation Support&#13;
(US$10.5 million; 3.2 percent). The project would include preparation work and supervision of&#13;
construction for the transmission mains and other facilities, studies for and supervision of the relocation&#13;
and rehabilitation of displaced persons (see the description for Componenit 2) and preparation studies for&#13;
the Second and Third Projects relating to distribution, conservation and environmental sanitation. No&#13;
training is envisaged. The technical assistance will not include policy support or institution building in&#13;
this project.&#13;
D.    Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
2.14   Cost estimates for the project are summarized in Table 2.2 and presented in more detail in Annex&#13;
13. Total project costs are estimated at US$421.0 million (Rs. 16,380.37 million), including US$64.1&#13;
million for physical contingencies, US$31.0 million for price contingencies and US$28.6 million for&#13;
duties and taxes. The foreign exchange component is about US$107.8 million or 25.6% of the total&#13;
project cost.&#13;
2.15   The cost estimates are based on the findings of consultant-assisted project preparation studies.&#13;
The foreign exchange component estimates rely on the consultants' judgment based on experience and&#13;
include both direct and indirect elements of foreign exchange. The physical contingencies allowances&#13;
throughout are at the rate of 20% for works and equipment and 10% for services. Assumptions regarding&#13;
price escalation are provided in Annex 8 and include international and local inflation rates by calendar&#13;
year and movements in the US$/Re. exchange rate over the project period.&#13;

Technical assistance would be for project preparation and implementation support only. No policy support on institution&#13;
building is envisaged.&#13;
2.16   Project Financing. An IBRD Loan of US$275.8 million is recommended for the proposed&#13;
project. This would provide about 70.0% of total project costs, net of taxes and duties, or about 65.5%&#13;
including taxes and duties. It would finance all the foreign currency costs. The Loan would be made&#13;
available to the GOI, who would make the proceeds available to the GOTN in accordance with GOI's&#13;
standard arrangements for developmental assistance to the states of India. The balance of the financing&#13;
will be in the form of a GOTN grant to MMWSSB of about 17.2% of total project cost and MMWSSB&#13;
internally generated cash of 17.2% of total project cost. Justification for the GOTN grant is, in part, to&#13;
finance some items of the project which are not the direct responsibility of MMWSSB, and as such&#13;
should not be a charge to the Madras consumers, such as irrigation works and the village water schemes&#13;
on the pipeline route. The financing plan is provided in Table 2.3.&#13;

pn principal and interest. The MMWSSB contribution through internally generated cash would be yearly&#13;
throughout the project period. In order to generate sufficient cash to meet this financing requirement,&#13;
MMWSSB will adjust tariffs each year and take other actions to enable sufficient funds to be generated.&#13;
Aareement was reached at negotiations for MMWSSB to p2rovide to the Bank by the end of December of&#13;
the year preceding the relevant fiscal year, a report outlining the steps to be taken to ensure that its&#13;
contribution will be generated.&#13;
E.    Procurement&#13;
2.18   Procurement arrangements for the project elements are summarized in Table 2.4. Annex 10&#13;
provides details of procurement by Project Components. Agreement was reached at negotiations that&#13;
MMWSSB and TWAD would procure works. goods and services required for the proiect in accordance&#13;

2.19   Civil Works. The project includes about US$387.4 million in civil works. Civil works&#13;
estimated to cost the equivalent of about US$276.6 million would be carried out on the basis of&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB), in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement,&#13;
January 1995, representing primarily the transmission mains. These works would be awarded using the&#13;
"Supply and Lay" type of contracts. In view of the large value of this component, contractors would be&#13;
prequalified before inviting them to submit their bids. The civil works at the source (estimated to cost&#13;
US$27.7 million) will be undertaken by national competitive bidding (NCB) following bidding&#13;
procedures satisfactory and acceptable to the Bank. As this work at the source is limited to a few months&#13;
each year during the non-irrigation season, it would be implemented by awarding about 12-15 contracts&#13;
each year for four years and therefore would not be of interest to foreign contractors. City distribution&#13;
and water conservation works estimates to cost US$83.1 million would also be awarded under NCB&#13;
procedures. For all civil works contracts awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, local&#13;
contractors will be eligible for a margin of preference as allowed under the Bank's Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.20   Goods. The project includes about US$2 1.3 million for goods. The pumping stations (about&#13;
US$6.2 million) would be procured following ICB procedures, using the "Supply and Erect" type of&#13;
contracts. The water treatment plant (about US$2.9 million) where the work consists mainly of&#13;
replacement of mechanical and electrical equipment in the existing structure constructed under the 1970s&#13;
project and abandoned (including some rehabilitation of the civil works) anid the city distribution and&#13;
water conservation components as described in Ann1ex 4 would be procured following NCB procedures.&#13;
The project supports expenditures on equipment and materials for maintenance also, including vehicles.&#13;
Heavy equipment and smaller equipment in packages aggregating to US$ 1.00 million would be procured&#13;
through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. All major goods and equipment supply contracts&#13;
which are awarded on the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelinies would give a preferential&#13;
margin to local suppliers equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs of the competing imports or the existing rate of&#13;
customs duty, whichever is less. Other equipmenit available locally would be procured unider NCB&#13;
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. However, vehicles consisting of four-wheel drive, maintenance&#13;
trucks and cars for supervision up to a value of US$1.00 million would be procured in batches over the&#13;
project period following national shopping by obtaining quotationis from at least three reputed suppliers.&#13;
2.21   Consultants Services. Detailed engineerinig and supervisioni services (US$12.2 million) would&#13;
be carried out by consultants for purposes of project preparation and implemenitation support whose&#13;
qualifications, experience and terms and conditionis shall be satisfactory to the Bank. These will be&#13;
selected in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Use of Consultanits by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). The contract for the detailed engineerinig design of&#13;
the transmission main system to be financed ulider the First Project was signed with Acer Consultants&#13;
Ltd. of the United Kingdom in association with Shalh Teclhnical Consultants Pvt. ILtd. of Bombay in&#13;
February 1995. It is expected to finish by October 1995 with over 50%1/o of the work completed by June&#13;
1995. Submission of final designs and tender documents satisfactory to the Bank and incorpora&#13;
recommendations of an independent engineerinlg reviewv would be conditionis of Loan effectiveness.&#13;
2.22   The GOTN has agreed to employ international engineering conIsultanits to supervise construction&#13;
of the transmission main and would appoint them following selection procedures as per the Banik's&#13;
Guidelines. The role of the consultant would be defined in the Bidding DoctIMnetits and the conistruction&#13;
contract between TWAD and the construction coiitractor ultimately selected for the work as well as In&#13;
the contract to be finalized between TWAD and the consultant selected to supervise the constructioln&#13;
work. Agreement was reached at negotiationis that: the construction supervision consultanits would be&#13;
appointed before award of the transinission main constructioni contract: TWAD will submit final designs&#13;
and tender documents for rural water supply along the right of way satisfactory to the Bank by June 30,&#13;

US$200,000 and all consulting contracts in excess of US$ 100,000 for firms, US$50,000 for individuals,&#13;
will be subject to prior review by the Bank. With respect to all consulting contracts, irrespective of&#13;
value, prior review will continue to be required for: (a) terms of reference; (b) single source contracts&#13;
regardless of value; (c) all consultant contracts anid assignmenits of a critical nature (for exaniple, because&#13;
of environmental safety or public healtlh considerations) regardless of value; and (d) contract&#13;
amendments valued at more than US$ 100,000 equivalent, or those that raise the total contract value&#13;
about US$100,000 equivalent. All Prequalification Documents would be subject to the Bank's review&#13;
prior to inviting prospective applicants to prequalify. The Bank would also review prequalification&#13;
evaluation reports before the borrower notifies the successful applicants.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.24   The Bank's latest Stanclard Bidding Documents for Works (including Prequalifications), Goods&#13;
and Consulting Services will be used during the implementation of this project. Contractors will be pre-&#13;
qualified for the major and complex works such as the transmission mains. For city distribution and&#13;
water conservation, contracts would be single responsibility contracts whereby contractors will be&#13;
responsible for the supply of materials. The consultant acting as the Engineer to supervise construction&#13;
will be appointed under the same general conditions of contract as used by the Municipal Corporation of&#13;
Greater Bombay for the marine outfalls in preparation for the proposed Bombay Sewer Outfalls Project.&#13;

2.28   Special Account. To facilitate project implementation and to reduce the volume of withdrawal&#13;
applications, a Special Account will be established in US dollars with an authorized allocation to the&#13;
Reserve Bank of India of up to US$ 12.0 million, which is equal to the estimate of four-monthly average&#13;
disbursements, apart from very large contracts. Replenishment would be made quarterly or whenever the&#13;
special account is drawn down by about 50% of its initial deposit, whichever comes earlier. Agreemen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
was reached at negotiations that the Special Account will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to&#13;
the Bank and accounts and audits would be provided within nine months of the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
2.29   Retroactive Financing. GOTN have requested the Bank's retroactive financing for works at the&#13;
Veeranam tank and for priority distribution works. It is recommended that retroactive financing of up to&#13;
US$8.60 million is made for expenditure incurred after November 1, 1994 for priority distribution works&#13;
(valued at US$8.00 million) in the city of Madras and initial source works (valued at US$600,000) at&#13;
Veeranam tank. Retroactive financing would apply only where procurement is carried out in accordance&#13;
with Bank guidelines.&#13;
G.    Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M)&#13;
2.30   When completed, the entire project works from the Veeranam tank off-take will form an integral&#13;
part of the MMWSSB's water supply system. The works will be shown on the balance sheet of&#13;
MMWSSB which will have full responsibility for O&amp;M. As the major part of the transmission system is&#13;
outside the jurisdiction of MMWSSB, the tasks of operations and maintenance may be entrusted under&#13;
appropriate agreements to third parties, which could include TWAD. The tank itself will remain&#13;
primarily a facility for irrigation and as such will continue to be operated and maintained by the WRO.&#13;
H.    Dam Safety&#13;
2.31   Veeranam Tank. The Veeranam tank storage capacity is to be raised by financing provided&#13;
under the project. Under Bank guidelines for dam safety. a panel of experts would be appointed to&#13;
review the safety of the embankment. The task of the panel of experts should be greatly eased by&#13;
recently completed geotechnical investigations of the existing structure. The State's Dam Safety&#13;
Directorate inspected the tank in February, 1995.&#13;
2.32   Mettur Dam. No works are proposed at the Mettur Dam under the proposed project but this&#13;
does provide source water for the Veeranam tank. The PWD has provided the Bank with the last&#13;
inspection report by the State Dam Safety Directorate in November 1994. The report of this inspection is&#13;
being reviewed by the Bank's dam safety specialists.&#13;
I.     Environmental Assessment&#13;
2.33   The project activities during the pre-construction, construction and operational phases will have&#13;
both positive and negative impacts on various elements of the environment. Environmental mitigation&#13;
and monitoring plans have been prepared that address the potential adverse impacts and are presented&#13;
along with a summary of the findings of the Environmental Assessment (EA) undertaken by the National&#13;
Environmental Engineering Research Institute of Nagpur in Annex 14.&#13;
2.34   Positive Impacts. The most significant impact will be the improvement expected in public&#13;
health through the increased quantity, quality and reliability of water supply in the MMA. Augmentation&#13;
of the city's water supply is expected to reduce abstraction from the shallow aquifers in and around the&#13;
city, helping to reduce over-exploitation and possibly saline intrusion.&#13;
2.35   Negative Impacts. Increased supply will, of course, lead to increased wastewater volume.&#13;
Madras is one of the few cities in India to have invested on a large scale in secondary treatment of&#13;
wastewater as well as reuse of treated effluent. Expansion and upgrading of wastewater collection and&#13;
treatment systems are not included in this project as they are already components of the First Project and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
are proposed, along with low cost sanitation, as components of the Third Project. Annex I provides&#13;
further information on environmental sanitation arrangements in the First and Third Projects.&#13;
Construction of bunds at the Veeranam tank, transmission mains and related infrastructure will result in&#13;
the loss of some agricultural land for which there will be appropriate compensation and rehabilitation&#13;
and resettlement of project affected persons. There will be adequate mitigation measures to minimize&#13;
soil erosion due to the excavation of trenches for transmission pipelines. There will be some&#13;
concentration of dust and noise nuisance during construction activities for which, again, there are&#13;
mitigation measures in the plan. Normal traffic flow will be interrupted during construction particularly&#13;
along stretches of national and state highways. The conclusion of the environmental assessment for the&#13;
project, however, is that the environmental impact will on balance be significant and positive.&#13;
2.36   Assurances were received at negotiations that all involved agencies will receive adequate&#13;
numbers of copies of the Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan and include the mitigation and&#13;
monitoring measures in their designs, tender documents, construction supervision procedures and&#13;
operating procedures, as appropriate. In particular, in preparing terms of reference for consultants to&#13;
supervise the construction of the transmission main, TWAD will be required to define explicitly the&#13;
consultants' responsibility to monitor and enforce implementation of mitigation measures that are the&#13;
contractor's responsibility. Once augmented by these consultants, TWAD and MMWSSB and WRO&#13;
have adequate staff and equipment to supervise implementation of mitigation measures during&#13;
construction. Some specialized training may be required. Each agency currently has its own training&#13;
center and on-going training programs for its managerial, administrative and technical staff and where&#13;
appropriate, the programs will be adjusted to cover environmental topics which are pertinent to this&#13;
project. TWAD's laboratory has capability to perform the standard water quality analyses recommended&#13;
in the environmental management plan. TWAD will contract with qualified agencies for more&#13;
specialized testing and for the recommended air quality and noise monitoring during construction.&#13;
2.37   Assurances were obtained at negotiations that TWAD would make arrangements for public&#13;
contact offices to provide information to and receive questions and complaints from the public during&#13;
construction activities. MMWSSB already has a public relations office which could serve this purpose.&#13;
The District Collectors' offices, which will be playing a key role in coordinating road closures, will be&#13;
provided with advance information on the nature of and schedule for planned construction activities.&#13;
Annex 14 reports on the public consultation and disclosure activities conducted as part of the EA&#13;
preparation.&#13;
J.     Safeguards for Farmers&#13;
2.38   The Veeranam tank will have increased capacity following the source works under Component I&#13;
of the proposed project which will be used to store additional releases at certain times from Mettur. The&#13;
supply available to local farmers for irrigation purposes will exceed the supplies currently received in&#13;
normal, bad and very bad years. Thus the interest of the farmers are safeguarded despite the offtake for&#13;
Madras. However, during public consultations carried out as part of the project environmental&#13;
assessment, the farmers in the Veeranam command area stressed the need for formal operating rules at&#13;
the Veeranam tank. As a result of these discussions the GOTN has issued operating rules and a&#13;
contingency plan in a Government Order in October 1994. Government also has mechanisms in place&#13;
throughout the State to deal with and compensate for crop failure caused by drought which would apply&#13;
to the Veeranam irrigation command area. GOTN agreed at negotiations to continue the process of&#13;
public consultations with the affected farmers using a Non Governmental Organization (NGO). the&#13;
farmers associations and local governments, to ensure that full consensus continues to be achieved in the&#13;
application of the operating rules.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
K.    Relocation and Rehabilitation&#13;
2.39   The number of project-affected persons is 168 and project affected encroachers is 1,261, a total&#13;
of 1,429. Of these, 521 will require only resettlement, 864 will require only rehabilitation and 44 will&#13;
require both resettlement and rehabilitation (R&amp;R). An R&amp;R policy has been prepared, which is similar&#13;
to the proposed Tamil Nadu Water Resources Consolidation Project, along with an R&amp;R action plan.&#13;
These are incorporated into a Government Order which has been reviewed by the Bank for consistency&#13;
with the relevant Operational Directive (OD 4.30). Implementation of the R&amp;R policy will reflect the&#13;
progress of the project, with displacement to be undertaken as needs arise. Implementation will be&#13;
GOTN's responsibility working through District R&amp;R Committees under the District Collector, and&#13;
NGOs will be used to facilitate the process, for example, by finding alternative sites and undertaking&#13;
training. Most displacement will be along the pipeline right-of-way where there is scope for many of the&#13;
affected persons to be re-settled at their pre-existing locations following the works. TWAD will&#13;
undertake monitoring and evaluation of implementation and will report findings to the PMG. The action&#13;
plan is estimated to cost Rs 9.9 million (US$0.3 million), but assurances have been received that&#13;
additional funds would be made available if required. Implementation of the R&amp;R action plan would be&#13;
a covenant in the legal agreements. Details of the R&amp;R policy and action plan are provided in Annex 6.&#13;
L.    Land Acquisition&#13;
2.40   The transmission right-of-way and land for associated facilities is already in TWAD ownership.&#13;
Additional small quantities of land currently held by GOTN will be required to allow construction of&#13;
four distribution zone headworks in Madras.&#13;
2.41   TWAD have obtained agreements in principle from the relevant highway authorities to allow the&#13;
transmission main to be constructed in the highway reserves in the outskirts of Madras between&#13;
Kelambakkam and Porur.&#13;
M.    Status of Preparation&#13;
2.42   Detailed engineering designs, satisfactory to the Bank, have been completed for at least 50% of&#13;
total project costs. Prior to effectiveness. TWAD would submit final designs and tender documents for&#13;
the transmission main, pumping stations and treatment plant satisfactory to the Bank. incorporating the&#13;
recommendations on an independent engineering review. It would be covenanted that by December 31.&#13;
1995 MMWSSB award a contract to consultants acceptable to the Bank for preparation of final designs&#13;
and tender documents for the initial phase of work for the distribution system component. and that&#13;
documents satisfactory to the Bank would be submitted by December 31. 1996.&#13;
N.    Accounts and Audits&#13;
2.43   MMWSSB has developed its entity accounting and management information systems under the&#13;
ongoing First Project. The accounts are produced according to commercial accounting procedures and&#13;
are produced in a timely fashion and without substantial audit comment. Both MMWSSB and the GOI&#13;
have complied with audit covenants under the First Project. The entity accounts are audited by an&#13;
auditor acceptable to the Bank within nine months of the end of the fiscal year and assurances would be&#13;
sought at negotiations to continue this arrangement under the proposed Second Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.44   PMG (para 3. 1) will make reimbursement claims, submit SOEs and maintain separate project&#13;
accounts. Agreement was reached at negotiations that SOEs and project accounts will be audited by an&#13;
auditor acceptable to the Bank and provided within nine months of the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
2.45   Under the financing arrangements for the project (para 2.16) MMWSSB will be required to&#13;
generate about 17.2% of the annual investment program by internal cash generation. Agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations that a plan acceptable to the Bank will be submitted by the end of December of&#13;
the year preceding the commencement of the relevant fiscal year providing details of the steps to be&#13;
taken by MMWSSB to generate the required funds.&#13;
0.    Insurance&#13;
2.46   Agreement was reached at negotiations that MMWSSB and TWAD will take out and maintain&#13;
with responsible insurers, or make other provision satisfactory to the Bank, adequate insurance consistent&#13;
with appropriate practice.&#13;
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Management Arrangements&#13;
3.1    Three agencies are concerned with the implementation of the project, MMWSSB, TWAD and&#13;
the WRO, the former irrigation wing of PWD. A Project Management Group (PMG) chaired by the&#13;
Secretary, Municipal Administration and Water Supply and consisting of technical, administrative and&#13;
finance staff deputed from all three agencies has been established by GOTN to oversee the&#13;
implementation of the project. TWAD is the agency responsible for the construction of the pumping,&#13;
transmission and treatment systems. MMWSSB is responsible for implementation of the distribution&#13;
and conservation component. WRO is the agency responsible for all source-related works.&#13;
3.2    An updated operational action plan (OAP) for implementation of the project was discussed at&#13;
loan negotiations. All items in the preliminary draft OAP are being satisfactorily addressed. Agreemen&#13;
was reached at negotiations that the MMWSSB and TWAID would carry out the project in accordance&#13;
with the implementation program (Annex 11).&#13;
B.    Supervision and Monitoring&#13;
3.3    The PMG will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the project. The OAP would be&#13;
updated annually or as circumstances require. The OAP will include a detailed implementation schedule,&#13;
monitoring indicators and allocation of budgets according to sound project management procedures and&#13;
analyses. It is proposed to use project management software for tracking progress and revising schedules&#13;
according to optimizing procedures which would be shared by the PMG and Bank supervision team&#13;
members. Additionally, at negotiations agreement was reached concerning the content of regular.&#13;
quarterly monitoring reports to be submitted to the Bank. The time required for project supervision by&#13;
Bank staff and consultants is not expected to be substantially different from the average for water and&#13;
sanitation projects in the Region, which is currently about twelve weeks per year. The proposal is for&#13;
two supervision missions annually. One to report on covenant compliance and sort out problems will be&#13;
longer in duration, and the other to be concerned with monitoring progress will be shorter. As&#13;
supervision efforts for this project will be undertaken in parallel with the supervision of the remaining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
phases of the First Project, and the preparation and initial phases of supervision for the Third Project, it is&#13;
likely that there will be some significant supervision cost sharing between these projects and that&#13;
supervision costs will be below average for the proposed project. A supervision plan is provided in&#13;
Annex 16.&#13;
3.4    Monitoring Indicators. During negotiations it was agreed that the indicators which appear in&#13;
Annex 5 would be reviewed on a quarterly basis except for the source works which would be reviewed&#13;
annually in July. These indicators cover physical implementation, water conservation and key financial&#13;
indicators related to the project.&#13;
C.    Implementation Schedule&#13;
3.5    Table 3.1 provides schedules for the design, procurement, construction and commissioning of the&#13;
project components involving works. The project is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2001&#13;
and the Loan would close June 30, 2002. Commissioning of the augmentation of water supply through&#13;
the transmission pipeline is expected towards the end of year 1999 or early 2000.&#13;

D.    Role of Bank During Project Implementation&#13;
3.6    Procurement documents, following standard bid documents for India agreed December 1993, for&#13;
the major project components, are subject to Bank prior review. Progress of the engineering works will&#13;
be closely monitored and corrective actions recommended, as appropriate, to avoid undue delays in&#13;
implementation. Attention of Bank staff will also be directed towards monitoring progress by&#13;
MMWSSB in water conservation improvements and the associated revisions of water tariffs, an&#13;
improved water metering program and distribution system improvement strategy. Close attention will be&#13;
given to the R&amp;R aspects of the project and to the implementation of provisions to safeguard the&#13;
irrigation rights of farmers in the Veeranam Command area. Agreement was reached at negotiations that&#13;
a mid-term review of the project would be carried out by GOTN, MMWSSB. WRO and TWAD by&#13;
September 30. 1998 and that a report would be prepared by about March 31, 1998, under terms of&#13;
reference satisfactory to the Bank, which would provide the foundation for the mid-term review. A&#13;
Supervision Plan is provided in Annex 16.&#13;
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A.    MMWSSB: Recent Financial Performance&#13;
4.1    Actions which have been undertaken as part of the First Project have significantly improved the&#13;
overall performance of MMWSSB including its financial performance. Financial Statements covering&#13;
the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Sources and Applications of Funds are to be found in Annex&#13;
8. The Income Statements are summarized in Table 4.1 for the years 1991/92 to 1994/95 (provisional).&#13;
The net income of the entity has transformed from a deficit at the start of this period to an expected profit&#13;
of Rs. 229 million last fiscal year. This improvement has occurred despite the significant problems&#13;
encotintered with the drought which led to substantial increases in operating expenses for which there&#13;
was, in 1993/94, an exceptional Government operating subsidy.&#13;

4.2    Tariff Increases. There was a major water tariff revision effective April 1, 1994 which largely&#13;
accounts for the expected increase of net income for 1994/95. Domestic flat rates were increased from&#13;
Rs. 12 per month to Rs. 30 per month, while industrial rates were increased from Rs. 12 per m3 to Rs. 30&#13;
per m3 with similar increases for all other consumer categories. The tariff revision and changes which&#13;
have occurred in the property tax assessments are expected to increase MMWSSB's projected internal&#13;
cash generation to Rs. 223 million in 1994/95, from Rs. 20 million generated in 1993/94. This projected&#13;
internal cash generation is more than sufficient to meet the OAP target cost recovery as covenanted for&#13;
the current fiscal year under the First Project. As part of project preparation a comprehensive tariff study&#13;
has been undertaken which provides substantial and reliable data on the use and affordability of water in&#13;
Madras, including evidence of the water obtained by consumers from sources other than MMWSSB.&#13;
B.     Water Conservation&#13;
4.3    The proposed project will continue the work started under the First Project to improve the&#13;
conservation of water. A water distribution and conservation strategy has been prepared and details are&#13;
provided in Annex 7. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the water distribution and&#13;
conservation strategv would be adopted and implemented in order to realize the full benefits from&#13;
reducing leakage, wastage and unaccounted for water generally.&#13;
4.4    The strategy for water conservation has three main elements: equitable distribution; metering;&#13;
and, a program of leak detection and rectification. More equitable distribution will be achieved through&#13;
the component of the project which provides for strengthening the distribution system. These distribution&#13;
works would include pumping mains and trunk mains; distribution stations each comprising a ground&#13;
level reservoir, pumping station and elevated reservoir to serve each zone; and, zonal distribution&#13;
networks. These distribution improvements will ensure that the pressure will be better maintained and&#13;
that tail-end areas do not suffer from very low pressure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
4.5    Metering.    Meters are not fully effective under a low pressure and intermittent supply. At&#13;
the present time metering is restricted to high volume consumers. It is proposed to implement a metering&#13;
program for all consumers sequentially, in zones covered by the project, and to move as quickly as&#13;
practicable to a volumetric charging system for all but the stand-pipe consumers during the course of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.6    Leak Detection and Rectification.    Studies were carried out in 1989/90 covering about 10%&#13;
of the city's water supply distribution system to identify sources of unaccounted for water and to evolve&#13;
a sequential program for carrying out detection and remedial actions. MMWSSB is undertaking a&#13;
program of replacement of mains. Mains of sizes 200 mm and below which are more than 50 years old&#13;
have been replaced during the last ten years. Work will continue with appropriate identification and&#13;
rectification measures including removal of illegal connections, improved billing performance, metering&#13;
and water repairs. Savings would certainly increase with the quantity of water distributed within the&#13;
system with the proposed project and with the arrival of Krishna water. About 20% of the city's water&#13;
distribution system has been covered by a program of unaccounted-for water reduction and a further 15%&#13;
would be covered by the First Project. At present bids are being invited in respect to works covering&#13;
60% of the city area.&#13;
4.7    Some additions to the water conservation strategy were agreed at the time of negotiations: (a)&#13;
inclusion of a public awareness program for the conservation of water; (b) introduction of completion&#13;
targets at semi-annual dates for the physical components of the water conservation plan; and, (c)&#13;
introduction of progressive volumetric tariffs as the metering program is expanded. Implementation of&#13;
the water distribution and conservation strategy would be a dated covenant in the legal agreements.&#13;
C.    Water Tariffs and Project Financial Analysis&#13;
4.8    The significant increase in tariffs introduced on April 1, 1994 (para 4.2) puts MMWSSB in a&#13;
strong position to move forward to implement the proposed project. Additionally, it has been agreed that&#13;
there shall be at least 10% annual increases in tariffs over the project period. However, the requirement&#13;
of the financing plan that 17.2% of the cash requirements for investment should be internally generated&#13;
by MMWSSB will mean that the tariff increase will need to significantly exceed 10% in some years.&#13;
Financial projections have been performed for MMWSSB which appear in Annex 8. On the assumption&#13;
that the Krishna water does not enter the system and the Third Project is not implemented (that is,&#13;
assuming a stand-alone Second Project), the domestic charge per connection will need to rise from Rs.&#13;
30 to about Rs. 50 in the year 2000 and the tariff for industry will need to rise from about an average of&#13;
Rs. 25 per m3 to about Rs. 40 per m3 in the year 2000 which is consistent with the 10% annual increase.&#13;
Thereafter, there would be significant one-time increase in the year 2001 when tariffs would need to&#13;
increase by an additional 30% as the cash requirements to cover the debt servicing of the project&#13;
following the five-year grace period start to come into effect. It would be covenanted that MMWSSB&#13;
would need to generate its contribution to the financing plan of 17.2 percent from internal cash&#13;
generation (para. 2.17) which mainly would arise from tariff increases. The tariff study indicates that for&#13;
domestic consumers with private connections increases of this order of magnitude are affordable. Slum&#13;
dwellers are shielded from the tariff and tax increases as they receive water from standpipes at no charge.&#13;
4.9    Financial projections are conservatively stated as they do not fully take into account&#13;
improvements in financial performance because of the implementation of the water conservation&#13;
strategy. It is not practicable at this stage to estimate the tariff implications of the proposed conservation&#13;
measures but they would be beneficial, increasing as the implementation of the plan extends&#13;
incrementally across the whole city. Additionally, the financial projections do not take into account&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
additional net income from the Krishna River source. Sensitivity analyses have been performed&#13;
incorporating the Krishna water and the expected incremental costs of the Third Project. These&#13;
sensitivity analyses show that there would be additional sales early on, starting from 1996/97 and&#13;
increasing through to about 2001, which would add about Rs. 700 million annually to the net income of&#13;
MMWSSB assuming that the 10% per annum tariff increase applies. After about the year 2001 the&#13;
additional costs of the Third Project would reduce the net income to a deficit in at least a few years and&#13;
some additional tariff increase beyond that projected for the Second Project would be required to meet&#13;
the investment cost requirements from internally generated sources. The conclusion of the sensitivity&#13;
analyses therefore is that the Krishna water would be beneficial to the financial performance of&#13;
MMWSSB during the project period (although not necessarily later on) which adds reassurance that the&#13;
contribution to the Second Project investment costs will be forthcoming from MMWSSB.&#13;
V.    PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A.    Economic Evaluation&#13;
5.1    The major direct effects of the proposed project would be the provision of: (a) an improved level&#13;
of water supply service; (b) improved distribution within the city leading to a more equitable outcome;&#13;
(c) improved conservation of water; and (d) better management of the services. These direct benefits&#13;
would yield secondary benefits. Greater domestic supply would provide health improvements and&#13;
convenience benefits to the general public and to the poor. With the shortage of water experienced in&#13;
Madras the risk of epidemics is high, and reducing the risk would be a major benefit. The city's&#13;
economy is mostly dependent on the public water supply and there would be cost savings from the&#13;
improved service. Environmental benefits would arise due to reduced over-exploitation from private&#13;
tapping of the shallow aquifers.&#13;
5.2    The costs of the project include construction and incremental O&amp;M. The transmission mains&#13;
and associated works are dominant for both aspects of costs, with power for pumping being the single&#13;
largest item of O&amp;M. Optimization of the pipeline options involved a least cost analysis incorporating&#13;
these factors (Annex 4), utilizing the economic costs of power supply.&#13;
5.3    Economic Rate of Return (ERR). Calculations have been performed for the transmission&#13;
mains and related works only, since estimation of the benefits arising from distribution improvements in&#13;
the city would be complicated by their programmatic nature, being part of the continuous upgrading&#13;
started in the First Project and continuing with the Third. The principal benefit arising from the&#13;
transmission main is the supply of additional water to Madras. The ERR calculations were carried out&#13;
using constant February 1995 prices, and the application of a standard conversion factor of 0.9 to all&#13;
items valued in Indian currency. 180 mid is assumed to be delivered at Porur from the transmission main&#13;
and to enter the distribution system where losses after the year 2000 are assumed to be 20%, following&#13;
distribution and conservation improvements.&#13;
5.4    The benefits of the incremental water have been calculated using willingness to pay derived from&#13;
high cost tanker purchases for domestic consumers, and payments made for water by industrial and&#13;
commercial consumers from all sources, including MMWSSB. This evidence was obtained from the&#13;
recently completed tariff study. Actual payments will understate the ERR since consumers may be&#13;
willing to pay more than they do pay. Moreover, the water will augment the city's supply and there will&#13;
be widespread benefit to all consumers, including the urban poor and industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
5.5    Annex 2 sets out the economic analysis according to basic assumptions and results of sensitivity&#13;
analyses. The ERR for the project is calculated to be 13.0 percent. A delay of two years in construction&#13;
execution would reduce the ERR to 11.0 percent as a consequence of deferral of the project benefits, and&#13;
a three-year delay would reduce the ERR to 10.1 percent. A 10 percent increase in capital costs over and&#13;
above the project's physical contingencies, which have been included as basic assumptions, would&#13;
reduce the ERR to 11.9 percent. The findings of the economic analysis are that: the ERR is above the&#13;
commonly adopted target for infrastructure projects (12.0 percent); compares favorably with other&#13;
projects in the water supply sector; and, is robust with respect to assumptions regarding capital costs.&#13;
Non-quantified benefits which should be considered in the overall assessment include the significant&#13;
reduction in the risks of epidemics and other health hazards in the city of Madras, convenience of&#13;
consumers, and the opportunities provided for more efficient utilization of water derived from the&#13;
implementation of the water conservation strategy.&#13;
B.    Impact on the Urban Poor&#13;
5.6    The project will benefit all consumers directly and indirectly. Residents will receive increased&#13;
and more reliable supplies. The poor will benefit particularly since they suffer most from the adverse&#13;
impacts of health and inconvenience due to inadequate water supply at present. They are less able to&#13;
afford the privately owned borewells and without private connections they are unable to store water.&#13;
Thus, although benefits of the project will be widely distributed in Madras, there will be particular&#13;
benefits to the poor which will be enhanced by the policy of providing supplies free at public standpipes.&#13;
The poor will also benefit indirectly through the strengthening of the economy of the city through direct&#13;
and indirect employment opportunities.&#13;
C.    Environmental Benefits&#13;
5.7    The most obvious and significant positive environmental impact of the Second Project will be&#13;
improvements expected in public health through increased quality, quantity and reliability of water&#13;
supply in the MMA. Additionally, the augmentation of water supply is expected to reduce abstraction of&#13;
ground water from shallow aquifers in and around the MMA. Adverse environmental effects of the&#13;
project have been safeguarded (paras. 2.33 to 2.36 and Annex 14.)&#13;
D.    Project Risks&#13;
5.8    The major risks likely to face the project are: (a) the capability of TWAD to&#13;
successfully construct the 235 km long transmission main; (b) the popular resistance to tariff&#13;
increases particularly around the year 2000 when they may need to exceed 10% annually; and (c)&#13;
a small risk that the source may in an exceptionally bad year or sequence of years fail to yield the full&#13;
192 mid (Annex 3).&#13;
5.9    The risk of inadequate execution capacity by TWAD will be mitigated by careful engineering&#13;
preparation using international consultants and also by the decision to assign experienced international&#13;
consultants to supervise the construction phase. Stringent prequalification of construction contractors&#13;
will also reduce the risk of time and cost overruns. The risk of default by GOTN in granting tariff&#13;
increases is not great as covenants relating to cost recovery in the First Project are in compliance and the&#13;
Government supports the principles of full cost recovery. A substantial tariff increase took place on&#13;
April 1, 1994 without significant incident.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
5.10   It is clear that for the purpose of the project it will not be feasible to obtain any form of assurance&#13;
from the Government of Karnataka that the release of water from the Cauvery system into the Mettur&#13;
dam will continue. Nevertheless, there is a long established arrangement between the States of Tamil&#13;
Nadu and Karnataka and there is no indicationi that it would be discontinued. The quantity of water to&#13;
Madras represents 1.5% of Cauvery River releases to Tamil Nadu. It is recommended to proceed with&#13;
the project since this r isk must be weighed against the advantages in relieving the hardships being&#13;
experienced by the people in the MMA. Tlhere are no indications to date that the farmers at Veeranam&#13;
will reject the proposals for safeguarding their irrigation interests, but consultations facilitated by an&#13;
NGO, the farmers associations arid local governments are underwav, and will be continued in order to&#13;
achieve and maintain full consenisus.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Descriptions of the First Madras Water Supply and Sanitation Project and&#13;
Proposed Third Madras Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project&#13;
1.    The proposed Second Project should be considered as part of a program of actions which will&#13;
greatly enhance the water supply of the city and the quality of water management. This Annex outlines&#13;
the characteristics of the First Project, currently ongoing, and the Third Project, under preparation, so&#13;
that the context for the proposed Second Project can be better appreciated.&#13;
The First Madras Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
2.    This project is financing about 60% of MMWSSB's investment program and is aimed at&#13;
increasing water supply and improving water distribution and sewage services in the MMA. The project&#13;
optimizes the use of existing resources and assists MMWSSB with the development of a plan for&#13;
managing medium and long-term water supply solutions of larger scope, including the Veeranam and&#13;
Krishna supplies. It also strengthens MMWSSB's financial and operational performance and is leading&#13;
to significant improvements in its capacity to manage the sector.&#13;
3.    The project components are as follows:&#13;
(a)    Augmentation of water supply sources (US$ 44.10 million]). This component increases&#13;
the amount of water supply to the city by about 102 mid and improves the reliability of&#13;
supply in drought years through a program of surface/ground water conjunctive use. It&#13;
includes the development of three new well fields, construction of check dams across the&#13;
Kortalaiyar River to retain seasonal floods and increase groundwater recharge and the&#13;
seasonal transfer of flood waters from the Arani River into the Kortalaiyar River through&#13;
a linking canal.&#13;
(b)    Improvements to the water supply and distribution system (US$ 11.06 million). This&#13;
component is rehabilitating, upgrading and extending the water supply and distribution&#13;
system in Madras. The component consists of construction of transmission mains,&#13;
ground level storage and pumping stations to distribute the additional water and&#13;
strengthening the existing distribution network.&#13;
(c)   Improvements to the sewage system (US$ 11.33 million). This component is improving&#13;
the effectiveness and extending the existing sewage collection system that provides&#13;
services to slums and low-lying areas of Madras. It consists of laying new and&#13;
replacement sewers, improving ten sewage pumping stations, and the provision of&#13;
collection, transmission and disposal arrangements for sewage.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(d)    Institutional strengthening (US$ 7.60 million). This component consists of the provision&#13;
of training, technical assistance and employee incentive program which is: (i)&#13;
strengthening the productivity of MMWSSB in three key areas - engineering design&#13;
and planning, O&amp;M and financial recovery; (ii) promoting the regulation of groundwater&#13;
extraction; (iii) assisting the planning and development of medium and long term water&#13;
supply solutions; (iv) providing a low cost sanitation program; and (v) improving policy&#13;
formulation, analysis and setting priorities.&#13;
4.     The planned area for the First Project is larger in size than the pre-existing water supply and&#13;
sewerage areas. These new areas are planned to be serviced in stages. The First Project serves Madras&#13;
city where the water, sewerage and sanitation needs are most pressing, and the Manali Industrial Park.&#13;
Under the project the area of piped water is being extended from 151 sq. km to about 163 sq. km. and&#13;
from about 117 sq. km. for water-borne sewerage services to about 145 sq. km.&#13;
The Proposed Third Madras Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project&#13;
5.     While the First Project is essentially intended to stem the deterioration of the existing water&#13;
supply and sewerage systems the scale of the tasks is such that a further program of works and&#13;
institutional strengthening is required. However, for the investments to be economically and socially&#13;
viable, there needs to be considerable increase in the supply of water to the city. The Second Project&#13;
will greatly assist. The investments currently under way to bring water from the Krishna River will also&#13;
increase the supply to Madras by a considerable amount. In essence, the Second Project and Krishna&#13;
Water will at least quadruple the water available to Madras. In order to utilize the new flows of water&#13;
effectively, a rehabilitation and expansion of existing water and sewerage systems, going beyond the&#13;
actions under the First and Second Projects, is essential.&#13;
6.     Thus, the Third Project has the objectives of further expanding and strengthening the water&#13;
supply and sewerage systems to effectively utilize the new flows of water to the city, increase the&#13;
cleanliness of the city and its water ways, improve access by the poor to sanitary excreta disposal and to&#13;
further strengthen the relevant environmental sanitation and water supply institutions. The area which&#13;
the project will cover will include Madras city and adjacent urban areas together totaling 335 sq. km.&#13;
7.     The proposed Third Project is expected to have five principal components as follows:&#13;
(a)    Water supply rehabilitation and expansion (estimated base cost of US$ 126.47 million).&#13;
This component will provide facilities to treat and distribute 400 mid of water to Madras&#13;
and adjacent urban areas. It includes the construction of rural and clear water&#13;
transmission mains, ring mains, headwork, leak detection and repair and the installation&#13;
of water meters.&#13;
(b)    Sewerage system improvements (US$ 72.00 million). The sewerage system will be&#13;
reinforced to handle the additional flow of sewage and waste. Specifically: (i) the&#13;
existing system will be rehabilitated, replaced and extended; (ii) sewer cleaning&#13;
equipment will be provided; (iii) new sewage pumping stations and force mains will be&#13;
constructed and existing ones improved and renovated; and (iv) the existing sewage&#13;
treatment plants will be rehabilitated and expanded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
(c)    Environmental sanitation (US$ 39.2 million). This component will be part of a long&#13;
term program to improve sanitation in the Metropolitan Area targeting especially for&#13;
vulnerable groups. It will include low cost sanitation, solid waste collection and&#13;
disposal, toxic waste collection and disposal and drainage and sullage disposal in&#13;
deficient areas within the city which would be served with water under the project. Also&#13;
included will be dredging, grading, desludging and filling of major waterways. There&#13;
will be a program of community awareness and hygiene education.&#13;
(d)    Institutional strengthening (US$ 6.43 million). This component will continue to&#13;
strengthen MMWSSB through training and technical assistance in five principal areas:&#13;
(i) use of consultants for the design and supervision of construction; (ii) strengthening&#13;
management information systems; (iii) contracting out certain O&amp;M operations; (iv)&#13;
providing additional training in specific areas.&#13;
(e)    Project support and technical assistance (US$ 27.7 million). This component would&#13;
include steps necessary to facilitate implementation of the project including consulting&#13;
services for project preparation, leak detection, the Project Management Unit and&#13;
hygiene education.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
I.    An economic analysis has been performed of the project focusing on the provision of 180 mid of&#13;
additional water to the city. The incremental costs of this additional water are the capital costs of source&#13;
works, transmission pipelines and related facilities and reception at the sump at Porur on the outskirts of&#13;
Madras, and the incremental O&amp;M costs associated with the provision of this water. The benefits are&#13;
those arising from the increased supply to the city.&#13;
2.    The analysis is contained in the accompanying table. All values are in FLb-95 constant prices.&#13;
The project period is assumed to be 30 years from commissioning. Pumps and other equipment are&#13;
assumed to be replace in year 15 from commissioning. From Porur there will be losses of water in&#13;
distribution which have been assumed at 20% giving a supply to the city consumers of 144 mid.&#13;
3.     Benefits and capital and O&amp;M costs (expressed in local (Indian) prices) have been adjusted&#13;
using the stanidard conversion factor of 0.9. Benefits are measured using the willingness to pay by&#13;
consumers based on their actual payments. Payments used for this purpose are the marginal alternative&#13;
supplies from tankers for domestic consumers, who are paying currently about Rs. 32 per m3 from this&#13;
source, and from all sources of supply for industrial and commercial consumers, who are currently&#13;
paying about Rs. 25 per m3 on average. Evidence for these payments was obtained from the recently&#13;
completed tariff study. Benefits have been increased in line with projected tariff increases (in real terms)&#13;
to year 2000, and weighted according to consumption quantities between domestic and non-domestic&#13;
consumers. On this basis the benefit has been assumed to be Rs. 44 per mi. It is fully recognized that the&#13;
use of tanker prices may underestimate the benefits, both directly since consumers may be willing to pay&#13;
more, and indirectly through health and other social benefits which are not counted.&#13;
4.     On the assumptions made the ERR is 13.0 percent.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.     Sensitivity anayses have been undertaken focussing on the adverse effects on the ERR of&#13;
changes to the assumptions on capital costs. Specifically, the ERR has been recalculated assuming:&#13;
implementation delays in the execution of the project, and hence in the realization of project benefits and&#13;
the incurring of O&amp;M costs, by two and three years; and, increases in the capital costs of 10, 20 and&#13;
30%. The following results were obtained:&#13;
Change in basic                               Economic Rate of Return&#13;
assumption&#13;
Two years execution delay                     11.0 percent&#13;
Three years execution delay                   10.1 percent&#13;
Capital costs increased by 10%                11.9 percent&#13;
Capital costs increased by 20%                11.0 percent&#13;
Capital costs increased by 30%                10.1 percent&#13;

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Reliability of Yield at the Veeranam Tank&#13;
I     The Veeranam tank is a shallow tank formed by an earth embankment 16 km long. The tank&#13;
origins date to the 11th Century. The tank now acts as a balancing reservoir for irrigation demands. It is&#13;
supplied primarily by the water released from the Mettur Reservoir located close to the Karnataka/Tamil&#13;
Nadu State border. The conveyance system to the Veeranam tank consists of a long stretch of the river&#13;
Colleroon and an unlined water course called the Vadavar Canal, which is 22 km long and terminates at&#13;
the tank. Attached is a schematic diagram of the Veeranam tank conveyance system.&#13;
2.     The capacity of the Veeranam tank is 27.74 Mm3 and its water surface area at full tank level is&#13;
about 20.83 sq. km. In 1923 its capacity was reported to be 40 .80 Mm3 indicating considerable silting&#13;
since that time. The tank supplies irrigation water to an area of 18, 158 ha in the South Arcot district, but&#13;
additionally the tank is used to supply irrigation water to a neighboring system, Sethiathope Anicut, at&#13;
the time of the latter's shortfall.&#13;
3.    The proposed project would increase the storage of the tank to 41.48 Mm3 by raising the level by&#13;
0.61 m. In the context of supplying water to Madras, the Government has stipulated that there should be&#13;
supplies made available during the irrigation season from July to February by keeping the tank full at the&#13;
enhanced storage ievel. From February to June there are normally no relk-a-es from Mett!r. The&#13;
additional capacity at Vecianam tank will ensure the Madras supplies at that time.&#13;
4.     Analyses have been performed of the potential yield of the tank using historical data. This&#13;
historical data has utilized daily flows over a 29-year period from 1965-1993. A simulation model has&#13;
been constructed for assessing the dependability of the tank for irrigation and Madras city water supply&#13;
under a 100-year scenario.&#13;
5.     The historic studies indicate there were six drought years over the period 1983-1990, in 1983,&#13;
1985, 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990 of which the last four were consecutively very bad years. It is a bad&#13;
year when the south west monsoon fails and the Mettur Reservoir is not open for irrigation until the end&#13;
of July, and a very bad year when along with the failure of the south-west monsoon, the north-east&#13;
monsoon also fails.&#13;
6.     An investigation has been made of the capacity of the Mettur Dam, considering the contents of&#13;
the Dam at the end of February and end of June since 1983, that is, looking at bad and very bad years. It&#13;
was found that there will always be live storage present in Mettur even after the releases for the special&#13;
supplementation for Madras and to meet the stipulated irrigation requirements for the farmers served by&#13;
Veeranam. This was so even in a!l four bad years from 1986 to 1989.&#13;
7.     An assessment has been made of the geology and seismicity of the zone. This shows clearly that&#13;
even though the region under consideration is not completely aseismic, there is no seismogenic feature&#13;
such as a fault line at the location of the tank or nearby. The Veeranam tank has a very wide spread and&#13;
reservoir induced seismicity is not applicable.&#13;
8.     The conclusions from the historical studies are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(a)   the Veeranam tank as it exists today is capable of satisfying irrigation demands with a&#13;
reliability of 72% (that is, in 72 years out of 100);&#13;
(b)    if the Madras city water demands of 190 mid are also to be met from the tank without&#13;
improvement and enlargement, the dependability of the irrigation releases falls to 66%&#13;
and the dependability of the supply to Madras would be 79%;&#13;
(c)   the reliability of the irrigation releases could be maintained at 72% and Madras&#13;
reliability increased to 81% by restoring the tank to its capacity in 1923 through&#13;
desilting and by lining the Vadavar Channel; and&#13;
(d)   the reliability of the water supply to Madras could be further increased to 95% with the&#13;
improvements proposed under the protect to both the tank and the Vadavar Canal, if an&#13;
additional average quantity of 10 Mm per annum were made available from Mettur.&#13;

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Description of Project Components&#13;
Component 1: Source Works&#13;
1.    In order to enable drawal of 192 mid of water and to meet the stipulated demands for irrigation&#13;
the Project envisages the following works at the Veeranam location:&#13;
(a)   improvements to the Vadavar Channel which serves the tank and which runs for a&#13;
distance of 22 km, through desilting and lining;&#13;
(b)    restoration and raising of the bund of the Veeranam tank by 0.61 m;&#13;
(c)   removal of a portion of shoal from near the inlet point of Vadavar and elsewhere inside&#13;
the tank;&#13;
(d)    rehabilitation and improvements to the existing surplus arrangements;&#13;
(e)    construction of cement concrete retaining wall in the upstream side of the bund of the&#13;
Veeranam tank in the deep bed sections;&#13;
(f)    weed clearance inside the tank and improvements to all sluices;&#13;
(g)   improvements to the tank drainage;&#13;
(h)    strengthening the existing foreshore bunds and forming new foreshore bunds for the&#13;
raised tank level;&#13;
(i)   improvements to the irrigation system including repairs to shutters and improvements to&#13;
channels and sluices;&#13;
(j)    formation of a new road on the raised bund of the tank and construction of a retaining&#13;
wall near a main road and local village.&#13;
2.    The WRO of GOTN would implement the above works.&#13;
Component 2: Transmission, Treatment and Resettlement&#13;
3.    Raw water from the Veeranam tank will be drawn through an open channel and will enter a&#13;
pumping station at Sethiathope nearby. A system will be provided for pre-chlorination. Transmission&#13;
from the Veeranam tank to the pumping station is by gravity main from where the raw water will be&#13;
pumped to the treatment plant at Vadakkuthu about 20 km away.&#13;
4.    The treatment plant at Vadakkuthu will utilize the existing structure provided for an earlier&#13;
scheme in the 1970s. The structure will be rehabilitated and new equipment installed. The existing&#13;
treatment plant consist of the following major structures; 4 clarifiers; a filter house; an overhead tank; a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
clear-water underground tank; and, a chemical house, administration and laboratory building. In addition&#13;
to the existing facilities, a clarifyier sludge/filter back-wash water processing/disposal system will be&#13;
provided. Treated water from the filters will be led to the existing treated water storage tank of 8,000&#13;
Mm3 capacity.&#13;
5.     A new pumphouse will be provided from where the treated water will be pumped to a higher&#13;
level reservoir at Kadam Pulliyar Ridge some 8 kms from the treatment plant, from where the water will&#13;
flow by gravity main to the terminal reservoir at Porur in the south-west of the city of Madras.&#13;
6.     It is proposed to use steel pipes with internal cement mortar lining and external gunniting. It&#13;
would be for the contractor to determine the precise mode of supply but most probably these pipes would&#13;
be fabricated from mild steel plates on a site using the locations that were adopted in the earlier 1970s&#13;
scheme for which there would need to be some clearance of the old fabrication plant and equipment. The&#13;
diameters of the transmission pipeline vary according to the sections: intake to the treatment plant at&#13;
Vadakkuthu, 1800 mm; treatment plant to Kadam Pulliyur Ridge, 1775 mm; Kadam Pulliyur Ridge to&#13;
Aringiar, 1875 mm; Aringiar to Porur, 1525 mm.&#13;
7.     The right-of-way mostly follows highway reserves and margins. In six places there are runs&#13;
across country, mostly across paddy. There will be displacement of people along the right of way, for&#13;
which provision has been made to ensure the restoration or enhancement of their standard of living up to&#13;
or above levels enjoyed by them prior to the commencement of the implementation of the project&#13;
(described in detail in Annex 6). The treatment of displacement of population will be as an integral part&#13;
of Component 2 but given the nature of the expenditures to be incurred, costs for resettlement are shown&#13;
against Component 5, Technical Assistance and Support in the project cost tables (Annex 13). There are&#13;
eighteen river and stream crossings for the pipeline for which seven pipe bridges are in existence from&#13;
the earlier scheme. There are seventeen major road crossings with fifteen culverts already constructed&#13;
and four railway crossings with three culverts already constructed and with the possibility of using an&#13;
existing culvert for the fourth crossing.&#13;
8.     Four alternative schemes were shortlisted and investigated for the water transmission, treatment&#13;
and pumping system. These four alternatives varied according to the location of the treatment plant and&#13;
the dimensions of the steel pipe for different sections. The optimization was based on a least cost&#13;
analysis incorporating the construction costs and power tariffs costs and interest rates over a range of&#13;
altemative assumptions. The preferred scheme was the one with an evaluated cost which was the lowest&#13;
which also provide for the greatest reliability of supply.&#13;
9.     Only a single transmission main is proposed. The pipe will be underground for its length except&#13;
at river and stream crossings where the pipe will be on bridges, and in marshy areas where it will be on&#13;
saddles. Pipes that are buried will be provided with RCC jacketing in deep cuts and below minor road&#13;
crossings.&#13;
10.    At Porur land has been acquired sufficient to provide an underground storage reservoir of 8000&#13;
Mm capacity, the same as at the treatment plant at Vadakkuthu. In addition a pumphouse will be&#13;
provided for pumping the water into the transmission system.&#13;
Component 3: City Distribution&#13;
11.    The terminal reservoir and pumping station at Porur is included in this component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
12.    There is an immediate need, for which retroactive financing has been requested, for&#13;
improvements to the distribution system costing some Rs.250 million. These works form part of the&#13;
overall master plan. They include pipelines, pumps and accessories relating to a clear water transmission&#13;
main from the Redhills treatment works to the junction of Arcot Road and the inner ring road in Madras&#13;
and extensions to the system to the southern headworks at Valluvarkottam and strengthening supply to&#13;
the Adyar Zone. Additional works for retroactive financing under the Project include replacement of old&#13;
pipes at the Adyar River crossing, additional pipelines from the junction of Sardar Patel Road and&#13;
Gandhi Mandapan Road to the Pallipettu headworks, additional pump sets at Pallipettu, and additional&#13;
works at a number of other pumping installations.&#13;
13.    After the first stage of distribution improvements which are scheduled to be completed during&#13;
1995, a further program of works will be undertaken. These additional works will be the subject of&#13;
feasibility studies and detailed engineering design still to be undertaken.&#13;
Component 4: Water Conservation&#13;
14.    There will be a clear defined program for the successive rehabilitation of the distribution zones&#13;
including leak detection and repairs, replacements, strengthening and bulk metering. Also involved&#13;
would be progressive introduction of comprehensive coverage of domestic metering in each zone. The&#13;
program of water conservation will include tariff increases to bring about more efficient use of water by&#13;
consumers, particularly domestic. The tariff increases will be required to satisfy the financing plan and,&#13;
specifically, MMWSSB's need to generate funds for its share of the investment financing requirements.&#13;
Component 5: Technical Assistance for Project Preparation and Implementation Support&#13;
15.    The project would include: preparation work and supervision of construction for the transmission&#13;
mains and other facilities; studies for and supervision of the relocation and rehabilitation of displaced&#13;
persons, the costs of which are included in this component, and also preparation studies for the Second&#13;
and Third Projects relating to distribution, conservation and environmental sanitation.&#13;

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
The Relocation and Rehabilitation Plan&#13;
I.    An R&amp;R policy has been prepared which is similar to the Bank's Proposed Tamil Nadu Water&#13;
Resources Conservation Project, with an action plan to implement the policy. Implementation of the&#13;
R&amp;R will reflect the progress of the Project, with displacement occurring ahead of the works. There is&#13;
scope for many displaced persons to be resettled at their pre-existing locations following temporary&#13;
relocation during the works and this will be achieved as far as possible. The policy and action plan were&#13;
found to be in conformity with the Bank's requirements as defined in OD 4.30. The main objectives of&#13;
GOTN for the policy are:&#13;
(a)   to minimize displacement as much as possible and avoid displacements altogether&#13;
wherever possible by adopting alternative plans;&#13;
(b)    wherever resettlement is unavoidable, ensure that the displaced persons gain greater&#13;
social benefit than hardship as a result;&#13;
(c)    provide community benefits which clearly exceed the disbenefits to the project affected&#13;
families (PAFs);&#13;
(d)    provide the PAFs with a share in the project benefits wherever practicable including&#13;
improved income and employment opportunities, land, infrastructure, roads etc.&#13;
(e)    provide appropriate personalized attention to the PAFs during the resettlement period;&#13;
(f)    provide proper compensation to the PAFs for their losses at full replacement costs;&#13;
(g)    give support during the physical movement of belongings and personnel;&#13;
(h)    ensure restoration or improvement in prior income levels;&#13;
(i)    for poorer sections, provide new development programs to improve standards of living;&#13;
and&#13;
(j)    encourage community participation in planning the implementation of the resettlement&#13;
program at all stages using where appropriate, existing social and cultural institutions.&#13;
Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and Activities&#13;
2.     The R&amp;R issues arise from land displacement at the source and of encroachers along the right-&#13;
of-way of the transmission line. At the source some 22.56 ha of patta (private) land have been acquired&#13;
and 2.09 ha of Government land. 68 families are affected but not displaced. These are mostly farmers&#13;
with land holdings that are not viable for income generation even prior to acquisition. Ninety-one&#13;
families would be displaced from the tank bund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.     Between the Veeranam tank and Kelambakkam, a distance 190 km there are 641 encroachers on&#13;
the transmission right-of-way owned by TWAD consisting of 465 houses (which include 42 living in the&#13;
pipes of the earlier 1970s scheme), 145 shops and 31 agriculturists. Not all of these will need to be&#13;
displaced. About 75% of the houses will be lost and 22% of the shops. Where there has been&#13;
encroachment of agricultural land holdings, the encroachment is less than 10% of these encroachers total&#13;
land holdings.&#13;
4.     From Kttambakkam to Porur, a distance of about 46 km there are 64 families that are&#13;
encroaching on Highway Department land to be evicted. 43 of these consist of a house only and the&#13;
others include shops.&#13;
5.     Considering all categories, there were found to be 1,429 PAPs consisting of 168 project affected&#13;
persons and 1,261 project affected encroachers. Of these, 521 will require only resettlement, 864 will&#13;
require only rehabilitation and 44 will require both resettlement and rehabilitation. Details of the&#13;
classification of the PAPs and their entitlements are provided in paragraph 7 below.&#13;
6.     Other structures will be affected by the transmission pipeline which number 61 in all, including&#13;
bus shelters and wells.&#13;
Classification of Project Affected Persons&#13;
7.     The plan categorizes the PAPs into twelve as follows:&#13;
Category       Description                           Summary of Proposed Compensation&#13;

8.     GOTN will be responsible for implementation of the RAP, working through District R&amp;R&#13;
Committees headed by the District Collector who has financial powers. Implementation will be&#13;
facilitated by the appointment of NGOs, for example, to identify alternative lands and assist with training&#13;
for alternative vocations. The involvement of NGOs will provide valuable assistance in the endeavor to&#13;
ensure viable communities. The Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA)&#13;
program will be extended to cover all the PAPs. There would be local committees to hear grievances and&#13;
take necessary actions. TWAD will carry out monitoring and evaluation of the RAP implementation,&#13;
and will report to the Project Management Group on indicators of progress.&#13;
Costs&#13;
9.     The estimated cost of the R&amp;R plan is Rs. 9.9 million (US$0.3 million) made up as follows: (a)&#13;
land, wells, plots and structures - Rs 3.7 million; (b) resettlement grants, transportation grants,   0&#13;
rehabilitation loans and grants, and maintenance allowances - Rs 3.0 million; (c)training - Rs 0.9&#13;
million; (d) civic amenities - Rs 0.4 million; (e) project management and monitoring expenses and NGO&#13;
oosts - Rs 0.5 million; and. (f) consultations and studies - Rs 0.5 million, plus contingencies at 10% - Rs&#13;
0.9 million. GOTN has provided a written undertaking to allocate additional funds for R&amp;R, including&#13;
maintenance allowance, should the need arise.&#13;

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Water Conservation Strategy&#13;
1.    MMWSSB has adopted a strategy for water conservation with three primary objectives:&#13;
(a)    to ensure a more equitable distribution of water;&#13;
(b)   to introduce and make effective metering for all consumers in a phased program; and&#13;
(c)   to continue with the program of leak detection and rectification, extending from the 20%&#13;
of the city already completed to 100%.&#13;
2.     Equitable Distribution. Supply is intermittent with restricted hours and parts of the&#13;
system with zero pressure. The intention is to increase the number of distribution stations from 4&#13;
at present to 16 eventually in order to reduce the distance of the tail-end areas from the reservoir thereby&#13;
increasing the pressure to the remoter parts.&#13;
3.     Metering. The effectiveness of meters is low when the pressure in the system is low and&#13;
supply is intermittent. Accordingly, the metering installation program must go hand in hand with&#13;
the distribution strengthening and increases in supply. As the zonal improvements take place so the&#13;
conservation strategy requires that all consumers become metered. Charging on a volumetric basic&#13;
would encourage consumers to reduce waste.&#13;
4.     At present all the non-domestic consumers are metered. More than 80% of revenue is collected&#13;
through these metered connections. No domestic consumers are metered and the charges are on a flat-&#13;
rate basis. The meters presently available operate where the velocity of water is measured in a rotating&#13;
vane and converted to a volumetric measure which is registered on the dial. These meters are not&#13;
suitable for intermittent supply. Inquiries are taking place to identify meters which can work reliably&#13;
under intermittent supply and which are expected to work for extended periods. It is proposed to have a&#13;
consultancy for the metering program during 1995 to investigate the options and work out a program for&#13;
metering installation. It is anticipated that the metering program would be completed by September&#13;
1997.&#13;
5.    Leak Detection. 20% of the city has been completed and rectification undertaken and the leak&#13;
detection program will continue until there is 100% coverage.&#13;
6.     Much of the distribution system is more than 100 years old but mains of sizes 200 mm and&#13;
below which are more than 50 years old have been replaced over the last ten years. Studies were carried&#13;
out in 1989/90 on a pilot basis covering 10% of the city in order to study the distribution system and&#13;
identify possible areas and zones where leak and waste detection programs could be carried out. The&#13;
study also evolved a program for carrying out the surveys of leak and waste detection and a&#13;
quantification of the water lost. A methodology was established for studying unaccounted for water&#13;
suitable for Madras and 14,600 connections in 215 field tests were covered and rectification works were&#13;
carried out. The economics of the actions taken were found to be favorable.&#13;
&#13;

7.     As part of a continuous program, another 10% of the distribution system under a second phase&#13;
was awarded to the consultants and work is under progress. It is proposed to continue with this work&#13;
eventually to cover the entire city. Currently, bids are being called for a further 60% of the area. It is&#13;
hoped that the full program may be completed by December 1997.&#13;

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Financial Projections and Tariffs&#13;
I.    During the First Project MMWSSB has considerably strengthened its finances. In 1986/87&#13;
internal cash generation by MMWSSB was nil but was Rs 26 million in 1993/94 and may rise to Rs 247&#13;
million in 1994/95. Over the same period water charges and water/sewer tax collection efficiencies rose&#13;
from 50% and 40% to 82% and 78% respectively. Financial cost recovery covenants have been&#13;
achieved, despite difficult operating conditions with the drought. Improving the finances is important for&#13;
cost recovery and as part of the long term aim to corporatise the entity. Financial strengthening is part of&#13;
the overall strengthening of the institution. MMWSSB is already in a position to privatize some of its&#13;
operations such as the sewage pumping stations, sewer cleaning (on a pilot basis), sewer connections and&#13;
O&amp;M of handpumps. The intention is to sustain the financial strengthening under the Second Project&#13;
through a continuous program of institutional improvements leading to efficiency gains, and to maintain&#13;
upward pressure on tariffs to recover costs and encourage conservation.&#13;
2.     The water from the Veeranam source will be costly, and probably will constitute the most&#13;
expensive source of supply. Cost recovery requirements will dictate continuing increased in tariffs and&#13;
control over costs. A major tariff study has been completed as part of project preparation and it is&#13;
intended that this study will be the basis for tariff reforms during the course of the project. MMWSSB&#13;
must contribute a share of the total project cost equal to about 17.2 percent out of internal cash&#13;
generation. This will require substantial tariff increases. In order to explore the implications of the&#13;
project for the finances of the entity a financial analysis has been performed by the Finance Department&#13;
of MMWSSB which is reported below. MMWSSB produces accounts on the commercial (accruals)&#13;
basis. Three sets of statements have been prepared, the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Sources&#13;
and Applications of Funds, with associated performance ratios.&#13;
Recent Financial Performance and Financial Issues&#13;
3.     The statements provide actual outturns for FY92 to FY94. During this time there were&#13;
exceptional drought conditions. Despite these conditions net income rose from Rs -65 million to Rs 11&#13;
million. A substantial tariff revision on April 1, 1994 of about 250 percent is expected to lead to a net&#13;
income in the current FY of about Rs 229 million. Thus there has been considerable improvement in the&#13;
overall financial position of the entity.&#13;
4.     Nevertheless, MMWSSEI remains inefficient when compared with water utilities in other&#13;
developing countries. Manning levels are high. For example, the volume of water sold is about 17,000&#13;
m3 per employee per annum, but 100,000 m3 would be reasonable. Staff costs are a high proportion of&#13;
operations costs, at around 60 percent, but 40 percent would represent an efficient level based on&#13;
experience elsewhere. The tariff structure needs revision. At the present time industrial consumers are&#13;
using about 25 percent of the volume supplied and are paying about 75 percent of the total revenues.&#13;
There is a need to move to volumetric charging for all consumers with private connections with a shift in&#13;
the relative contributions of consumers to the domestic sector and away from the industrial.&#13;
Additionally, sewerage revenues comprise 20% of water revenues for consumers with an access to a&#13;
sewer, but sewerage costs are much higher relative to water charges than this relative position implies.&#13;

Projections&#13;
5.    Key Assumptions. Projections have been made to the end of the project period in FY2002, and&#13;
beyond to FY2005. The following inflation and exchange rate assumptions have been used both in the&#13;
financial analysis and also the preparation of the cost tables in the main text of this SAR:&#13;
Calendar   External       Indian      Exchange&#13;
Year      Inflation    Inflation       Rate&#13;
(%)          (%)         Rs/US $&#13;

1997        2.6          8.0           37.4&#13;
1998        2.5          7.0           39.8&#13;
1999        2.5          6.0           42.0&#13;
2000        2.5          6.0           44.3&#13;
2001        2.5          6.0           46.7&#13;
2002        2.4          6.0           49.3&#13;
2003        2.1          6.0           51.2&#13;
2004        2.1          6.0           53.1&#13;
6.    Investments included in the financial projections include the First Project, other investments&#13;
being undertaken by MMWSSB which are largely being financed by HUDCO as well as the proposed&#13;
Second Project. These projections do not include the effects of the proposed Third Project which is,&#13;
however, subject to sensitivity analysis.&#13;
7.    Revenues. These have been projected to increase by 10 percent annually except for those years&#13;
where they need to be higher when it is not possible to achieve the cost recovery and financing targets of&#13;
17.2 percent contribution to Total Project Cost. The need for additional revenue beyond that generated&#13;
by a 10% annual increase in tariffs occurs about FY99-2000 when the grace period on principal and&#13;
interest for the Second Project comes to an end.&#13;
8.    The average revenue per m3 consumed will increase from about Rs 8.26 in 1995 to Rs 25.00 in&#13;
2002. Increased revenues will derive from the tariff increase and the additional quantity of water&#13;
supplied, and the benefits from the program of water conservation which includes metering and&#13;
reduction in unaccounted for water.&#13;
9.    Operating Expenses. In making the projections the number of employees is maintained at&#13;
current levels, about 3,950, but with increasing volume of water sold this will mean significant efficiency&#13;
gains. Unit charges for salaries, power and other items are projected to increase with the rate of&#13;
inflation. From the year 1999 there is a significant increase in power costs due to pumping and other&#13;
requirements due to additional water flow from Veeranam.&#13;
10.   Interest and Depreciation. Depreciation is assumed to be 2.8% of gross fixed assets which&#13;
represents MMWSSB's weighted average of depreciation applied to all categories of assets. Interest is&#13;
charged on market borrowing, project loans following the five year grace period, and the GOTN loans&#13;
for both existing and new projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
I1.    Findings. On the basis of the assumptions made, the rate of return on fixed assets will be&#13;
positive throughout the project period and in the range 1-9% pa. The Operating Ratio, the ratio of&#13;
operating revenues to operating expenses plus depreciation, is well over 1.00, and mostly over 2.00&#13;
signifying generous cost recovery margins. The most critical time in the forecast period is about the&#13;
years 1999-2000 when MMWSSB starts to bear the significant capital charges for the Second Project,&#13;
although this is the time when the water from Veeranam becomes available for sale. The principal&#13;
finding is that MMWSSB is able to achieve its cost recovery and financing targets whilst still making&#13;
water affordable.&#13;
Sensitivity of Findings to the Third Project&#13;
12.    During the implementation of the Second Project, water is expected to arrive at the Madras&#13;
reservoir system from the Krishna River source. The city distribution system will not have capacity to&#13;
absorb all the flows immediately, but as the distribution strengthening takes place under both the on&#13;
goinig First Project and the Second Project there will be additional water for sale which will greatly assist&#13;
with revenue generation. During this time it is anticipated that the Third Project will also be&#13;
implemented which will lead to a completion of the distribution strengthening and water conservation&#13;
measures throughout the City. The main costs for the Third Project would be incurred after the year&#13;
2000 on the assumption of a five year grace period for principal and interest. Accordingly, the Third&#13;
Project will increase MMWSSB's revenue position during the Second Project period and will have&#13;
significant cost implications well after this period. The Third Project will assist with the financial&#13;
strengthening of MMWSSB and may mean a lower level of tariff increases than is implied in the&#13;
projections.&#13;

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment Summary&#13;
A.    The Environmental Assessment Process&#13;
1.    The environmental assessment (EA) for the project was undertaken by National Environmental&#13;
Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) under contract to Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage&#13;
Board (TWAD), beginning in January 1994. The EA report was prepared in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of World Bank OD 4.01, Environmental Assessment, applicable to Category A projects.&#13;
2.    In many respects, this project could have been handled as Category B. The transmission main&#13;
right of way (ROW) had already been acquired, as had the sites that were being considered for the water&#13;
treatment works. A treatment plant had already been constructed at one of them, but never placed in&#13;
operation. There were no significant environmental issues associated with these aspects of the project.&#13;
Much of the background information and baseline data on the Madras Metropolitan Area (MMA) had&#13;
already been assembled in an EA prepared by NEERI in 1991 for the Water Supply Project then being&#13;
considered as the Second Madras Water Supply Project but now likely to become the Third.&#13;
Consequently, the EA Terms of References focused the bulk of the consultant's effort on a few particular&#13;
topics in which complex and significant adverse impacts were possible: (i) the potential impacts the&#13;
allocation of water for public supply from Veeranam Tank would have on farmers currently depending&#13;
on the tank for irrigation; (ii) safety issues associated with increasing the height of the bund at Veeranam&#13;
Tank and constructing and operating the treatment works, pumping stations, and transmission main; (iii)&#13;
ecological and land use impacts in the vicinity of Veeranam Tank; and (iv) water quality effects of&#13;
increased wastewater flows from Madras. Other areas of emphasis were: (i) impacts of water treatment&#13;
plant operation; (ii) any alternatives that should be considered at this stage of project development; (iii)&#13;
the opinions and concerns of affected persons, particularly in the Veeranam Command Area and along&#13;
the ROW; and (iv) development of an Environmental Managenient Plan for the project. The consultant&#13;
was directed to update and supplement the information in the 1991 EA as necessary, to conduct&#13;
reconnaissance to verify conditions along the transmissionl main right of way, to identify any other&#13;
significant issues that might not have been anticipated, but to otherwise limit collection of new field data&#13;
beyond that needed to address the main issues.&#13;
3.     The Final Report was completed in October, 1994 and made available for public inspection and&#13;
comment at multiple locations in the study area in accordance with BP 17.50, Disclosure of Operational&#13;
Information. It was officially submitted to tlhe Bank by Department of Economic Affairs, GOI in&#13;
February, 1995.&#13;
B.    Baseline Environmental Conditions&#13;
The Study Area&#13;
4.     The study area encompasses the Madras Metropolitan Area (MMA); areas presently irrigated&#13;
from the Veeranam Tank; land surrounding Veeranam Tank: the routes of the water supply canals which&#13;
transport water to Veeranam and need to be rehabilitated; the routes of the transmission main from&#13;
Veeranam to the proposed distribution storage reservoir site at Porur: and the sites of the proposed water&#13;
treatment plant, pumping stations/booster stations, and distribution reservoirs.&#13;
&#13;

Physical Environment&#13;
5.    Madras city is located on the coast of Bay of Bengal at latitude 130 04' N and longitude 0800 15'&#13;
E. The terrain is generally low-lying and flat with an average slope of less than 1:1500. Most parts of the&#13;
city are within 4 to 5 m above mean sea level. The city is traversed by two small rivers, the Cooum and&#13;
the Adyar. In addition, the Buckingham Canal passes through the city parallel to the coast. The climate is&#13;
tropical with a mean annual temperature of about 300C and relative humidity ranging between 65% and&#13;
80%. The city experiences a southwest monsoon from June to September, and a northeast monsoon from&#13;
October to December. The northeast monsoon brings a large share of the annual rainfall which averages&#13;
about 1300 mm.&#13;
6.    The topography along the proposed alignment of Veeranam pipeline (ROW) is undulating and is&#13;
crossed by rivers, drainage channels, railways, and state/ national highways. The Veeranam Tank and its&#13;
watershed are situated in the rain shadow region for the southwest monsoon. The 50 year average rainfall&#13;
of the area is about 11 00mm.&#13;
7.    The existing surface and groundwater resources in MMA have been strained to the maximum&#13;
with no scope for their further development to meet the needs of the city. Over-extraction of groundwater&#13;
in some areas has already produced signs of saline water intrusion in the aquifers near the sea. Based on&#13;
the population projections and the per capita supply rate for various categories of users, the present total&#13;
water requirement has been estimated as 1750 mid.&#13;
8.    The city is divided into five major zones for sewerage service, each comprising a large number&#13;
of collection areas. Each area is served by a sewage pumping station. There are presently 83 such&#13;
pumping stations with 10 more auxiliary ones discharging into the main pumping stations. Each zone has&#13;
independent collection, conveyance, treatment and disposal facilities. However, the major waterways in&#13;
MMA are highly polluted due to discharge of wastewater from public and commercial buildings not&#13;
connected to the sewerage systems and sewage and sullage from the squatter settlements.&#13;
Biological Environment&#13;
9.     The MMA borders the Coromandal coast of Tamil Nadu. Natural vegetative cover is poor, with&#13;
tremendous pressure from developmental activities and agriculture. However, efforts are being made to&#13;
increase cover through aforestation, protection of natural habitats such as sanctuaries and national parks,&#13;
and social forestry. Most of the land that would be traversed by the transmission main is not in natural&#13;
cover; it is either developed for residential use or used for agriculture or silviculture. Cashew plantations&#13;
are very common in South Arcot district, one of the districts along the ROW. There are nevertheless a&#13;
few patches of natural forest and reserve forest. Many aquatic weeds have been recorded from the area&#13;
around Veeranam Tank, and the shallow parts of the tank support substantial weed growth.&#13;
10.   The major surface water resources in the study area include Kortalaiyar River, Cooum River,&#13;
Buckingham Canal, Cholavaram Reservoir, Redhills Tank, and coastal marine waters with considerable&#13;
fisheries potential.&#13;
11.    Environmentally sensitive areas in the region include Guindy National Park, Anna Zoological&#13;
Park, Vedanthangal Water Bird Sanctuary, Karikili Bird Sanctuary, Madras Snake Park, Adyar Estuary&#13;
and isolated patches of protected forest.&#13;
&#13;

12.    Among the species of mosquitoes reported in and around Madras area are Anopheles stephensi&#13;
and A. culcifacies, vectors for malaria, and Culex quinquefasciatus which transmits filaria.&#13;
Socio-cultural Environment&#13;
13.   The MMA has witnessed rapid growth during the last few decades, with increased population&#13;
density in the already crowded central urban areas and strip development along the major transportation&#13;
corridors leading into Madras. The population of Madras city has grown from 0.55 million in 1901 to&#13;
3.84 million in 1991. The population in MMA (excluding the city) has grown from about 0.44 million in&#13;
1951 to about 1.47 million in 1991. The overall population densities in MMA are low with the maximum&#13;
being less than 100 persons per hectare. The predominant land use in the central urban areas is&#13;
residential, with a relatively even distribution of service-oriented commercial activities. Most of the large&#13;
industries are located along the major transportation corridors.&#13;
14.    There are many temples and important architectural monuments in and around Madras.&#13;
However, the project activities will not have any adverse impact on cultural properties. The study area&#13;
also does not have any distinct tribal communities which are likely to be affected due to the project.&#13;
15.    There has been a general increase in the incidence of diarrheal diseases, cholera and malaria in&#13;
the project area over the last two to three years, and a declining trend in incidence of filaria. The&#13;
incidence of Japanese encephalitis is highest in Villupuram Ramasamy Padayatchiyar district.&#13;
D. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Project&#13;
Overall Impact&#13;
16.   The most obvious and significant environmental impact of the project will be the improvement&#13;
expected in public health and quality of urban life through increased quantity, quality and reliability of&#13;
water supply in the MMA. In addition, the augmentation of surface water supply sources should allow&#13;
reduction in the abstraction of groundwater from the shallow aquifers of the river basins in and around&#13;
the MMA. This would lower the risk of both saline water intrusion into the aquifers and the incidence of&#13;
water-borne diseases caused by consumption of contaminated water from shallow wells.&#13;
17.   The proposed withdrawal of 192 mld of water from Veeranam Tank for supply to Madras will&#13;
not affect the traditional irrigation rights of farmers in the area irrigated by the Tank due to the proposed&#13;
increase in the storage capacity of the tank that will be provided in the project and the additional release&#13;
of 11.4 million cubic meters of water annually from Mettur storage.&#13;
18.    Activities related to the raising of reservoir bunds, laying of transmission main and construction&#13;
of pumping stations and storage reservoirs will result in the conversion of small amounts of agricultural&#13;
land. The transmission main construction will affect normal traffic flow and cause temporary but&#13;
unavoidable congestion in different parts of the city and along certain stretches of the national and state&#13;
highway between Kelambakkam and Porur. Consequent inconvenience to the public and commerce&#13;
could be minimized by proper planning, advance notification, accurate scheduling and efficient&#13;
management of construction activities and regulation of traffic. This can only be accomplished through&#13;
good coordination among all concerned agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 14&#13;
Page 4 of 13&#13;
19.    Environmental impacts of the proposed project have been evaluated using the Battelle&#13;
Environmental Evaluation System (BEES). Forty-eight parameters relevant to the project have been&#13;
identified under the categories of ecology, environimenital pollution, aesthetics and human interest. They&#13;
were used to compare the environmenital implications of implemilenting the project as originally designed,&#13;
implementing the project together with the Environimenital Management Plan (EMP) elaborated in the&#13;
EA, and not implementing the project at all. A summary of the evaluation is presented in Table 1. The&#13;
net change in environmental quality resulting fiom the proposed project compared to "no action" is&#13;
positive, even with no measures to mitigate potential adverse impacts. The improvement becomes larger&#13;
still when implementation of the EMP is assumed.&#13;
Potential Impacts During Construction&#13;
20.    Most of the construction phase impacts are of short duration and temporary. The construction&#13;
would lead to localized increases in dust and suspended particulate matter in the ambient air. Noise&#13;
impact on nearby communities will not be significant. However, transmission main installation in or&#13;
along the highways between Kelambakkam and Porur is likely to seriously disrupt vehicle traffic,&#13;
pedestrian access and commerce. Careful management can partially mitigate this impact, but some&#13;
disruption is unavoidable.&#13;
21.    Vegetative cover (i.e. forest, avenue trees, and agricultural land) is likely to be reduced. Natural&#13;
drainage in the area may be affected due to earthwork excavation and construction activity. Movement of&#13;
heavy machinery for pipe-layilg activity may cause a narrow strip of agricultural land along the&#13;
transmission main ROW to become uncultivatable temporarily, and compaction may alter the natural&#13;
properties of the soils. The overall effect on agricultural production will not be significant.&#13;
Potential Impacts During Operation&#13;
22.    With the augmentation of water supply by 180 mid from Veeranam, the per capita water supply&#13;
for the various categories of consumers in Madras city will increase. The need for augmenting individual&#13;
household supplies through private wells or commercial vendors will be reduced, with attendant savings&#13;
in time, labor and money. With the increase in water supply and consequent increase in wastewater flow,&#13;
the functionality of the existing sewerage system and the waterways water quality will improve.&#13;
23.    With increased water supply from Veeranam, the general health status and well&#13;
being of the people of Madras city will be significantly enhanced. The augmentation of water supply in&#13;
the project area will trigger an all round increase in developmental activity such as housing,&#13;
transportation, education and culture which would have a considerable impact on the life style of the&#13;
population. In sum, the overall impact of the project on the socio-economic environment is expected to&#13;
be beneficial and positive:&#13;
(a)    With the increased availability of water, the duration of water supply will increase and&#13;
the distribution network will remain charged with water under pressure for a longer&#13;
duration. This would reduce the chances of contamination in the water mains and&#13;
associated public health risks leading to reduced incidence of diseases, improved health&#13;
and productivity, and economic well-being of the community.&#13;
(b)    Another significant impact intrinsic in keeping the system charged for a longer duration&#13;
is the reduction in the potential for internal corrosion of distribution pipe lines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 5 of 13&#13;
(c)    As for the people in the area irrigated by Veeranam Tank, no socio-economic impact is&#13;
expected as there will be no reduction in their traditional irrigation water rights.&#13;
24.    Construction of the proposed straight cut to Godavari drain will significantly improve the&#13;
drainage of the surrounding area which is presently affected due to water logging and attendant reduction&#13;
in crop yield.&#13;
25.    The treatment plant will produce wastes in the form of clarifier sludge and filter backwash water.&#13;
While not hazardous, these can cause pollution of water or soil if not properly managed.&#13;
26.    Due to the storage of water in Veeranam Tank throughout the year and the associated vegetation,&#13;
micro-climatic changes would occur especially in and around the reservoir site. Increase in the&#13;
groundwater table in the area surrounding the Tank will have beneficial effect on vegetation and the&#13;
grazing fields. Social plantations will be successful to a large extent. Diversity of plant species will&#13;
increase showing healthier environment.&#13;
27.    The year round availability of water due to storage in the Tank may help to increase the number&#13;
of clean water flora and fauna such as diatoms. The potential for fisheries would also increase with the&#13;
availability of water in the reservoir throughout the year.&#13;
28.    Deweeding activity and increase in water level would bring about a change in the aquatic weed&#13;
growth which will not only reduce water loss due to transpiration but also the associated disease vectors,&#13;
especially mosquito larvae. The water quality may also improve.&#13;
29.    Bird migration to the Veeranam Tank may take place due to availability of water throughout the&#13;
year with possible increase in nesting sites/habitats. This will result in improving the diversity of animal&#13;
species in the project area.&#13;
30.    Use of fertilizers and insecticides in the catchment is relatively low. Should fertilizer come to be&#13;
applied excessively, nuisance algae blooms could occur in the tank and raw water quality could&#13;
deteriorate.&#13;
31.    Changes in soil quality may occur during construction mainly due to clearing of vegetative cover&#13;
along the right of way thereby causing soil erosion resulting in turbidity in surface runoff. The clearing&#13;
of forests and field habitats would result in destruction of terrestrial organisms.&#13;
32.    Due to storage of water in Veeranam Tank all through the year, the groundwater potential in the&#13;
surrounding area is likely to increase. This may improve the prospects of raising additional crops in the&#13;
area.&#13;
33.    Due to the project activities there is a great potential for employment both during construction&#13;
stage (short term) and during the post construction/ operation stage (long term). This, in turn, will have a&#13;
positive impact on the economy of the population, both local and regional.&#13;
34.    The proposed construction of a terrace along the foreshore bund in Suthamalli village with lawn&#13;
facilities using a part of the soil to be taken out from within the Tank is expected to improve the&#13;
aesthetics of the area with the potential for tourism promotion.&#13;

E. Analysis of Alternatives&#13;
35.   Three alternative transmission main alignments were considered for the section from&#13;
Kelambakkam to Porur in the region of Madras. The original right of way alignment of the 1970s&#13;
scheme was rejected to reduce the extent of involuntary resettlement. From the standpoint of potential&#13;
impacts, the route Vandalur, Pallavaram, and Alandur has been recommended.&#13;
36.   Two treatment plant locations were considered. Neither site-Vadakuthu or Mangalam-poses&#13;
significant environmental constraints. Use of Vadakuthu would involve less expenditure of resources&#13;
since treatment works already exist there and can be refurbished.&#13;
37.   The M.S. pipes with cement mortar lining inside and outside, proposed to be used as&#13;
transmission main will be safe from corrosion in the context of Veeranam water quality and the&#13;
characteristics of the soil along the pipeline ROW.&#13;
F. Environmental Impact Mitigation and Monitoring Plans&#13;
38.    Table 2 is a consolidated summary of the measures proposed for mitigating potential adverse&#13;
impacts and for monitoring changes in the environment during construction and operation of the project.&#13;
I. Revisions to the Environmental Assessment as a Result of Appraisal&#13;
39.    The appraisal mission did not identify any technical areas in which the assessment needed to be&#13;
modified. Improvements to the distribution system were added as a project component after the EA had&#13;
been completed, but there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the planned work.&#13;
Adherence to accepted design and construction practices, traffic management and worker safety procedures&#13;
should be sufficient environmental safeguards for the component. MMWSSB, which will be responsible&#13;
for the designs, will include the relevant mitigation measures from Chapter 8 of the EA and the worker&#13;
safety provisions of EA Annex 8.1 in tender documents.&#13;
40.   The mission reviewed arrangements for implementation of the Environmental Mitigation and&#13;
Monitoring Plans contained in the EA and determined that the arrangements are adequate. The WRO,&#13;
which is responsible for the design of the works at Veeranam, and design consultant for the transmission&#13;
main and treatment works have been given the EA and directed to incorporate design features that&#13;
respond to the EA recommendations for environmental protectien, including chlorine safety, clarifier&#13;
sludge and filter backwash water disposal, corrosion control, and landscaping. The designers will review&#13;
draft documents with the EA team prior to producing final versions. The designers will also incorporate&#13;
the recommended mitigation measures to control construction-related impacts and protect workers.&#13;
Environmental management training for construction supervisors will be added to the curricula at the&#13;
training centers already operated by PWD, TWAD and MMWSSB. The Terms of Reference for the&#13;
consultant that will supervise the transmission main construction will require provision of specialized&#13;
training in construction supervision to any TWAD personnel assigned to supervise this component.&#13;
41.   PWD, TWAD and MMWSSB report that they have sufficient staff and laboratory facilities to&#13;
undertake their construction management and operation, maintenance and monitoring responsibilities.&#13;

42.    On the particular topic of management of transmission line construction in congested areas to&#13;
minimize disruption of traffic, access and commerce, TWAD proposes to provide advance information&#13;
and updates to the District Collectors, who are well positioned to coordinate road closings, traffic police,&#13;
public information, and response to complaints. MMWSSB will undertake the same functions itself in&#13;
the distribution system improvements component. MMWSSB already has a Public Relations Cell, and&#13;
citizens are also able to bring complaints and questions to any of its depots (approximately 100) in the&#13;
metropolitan area.&#13;
J. Public Information and Consultation&#13;
43.   In order to identify any new issues in the implementation of the project, three public meetings&#13;
were organized in the project area by the project proponents with the assistance of NEERI. Six major&#13;
issues were raised by participants.&#13;
(a)    No objection to the project aimed at augmenting the water supply to Madras city&#13;
provided the withdrawal of 192 mid of water from Veeranam does not affect the existing&#13;
irrigation rights.&#13;
(b)    Need for a formal agreement between the Government and the agriculturists'&#13;
associations to safeguard their existing agricultural rights and to formulate operational&#13;
procedures for withdrawal of water from Veeranam tank for water supply to Madras.&#13;
(c)    Priority for completion of all works related to source improvement before commencing&#13;
drawal of water to Madras.&#13;
(d)    Concerns regarding compensation, and rehabilitation and resettlement of the project&#13;
affected persons in some cases.&#13;
(e)    Stress on employment opportunities to the extent possible to the local people.&#13;
(f)    An appeal to the project proponents to consider the possibility of providing water supply&#13;
from the transmission pipeline to the needy habitations en route.&#13;
44.    All these issues have been addressed during project preparation. Most significant was the&#13;
issuance of Government Order NO. 1084 dated October 26, 1994. The Order establishes operating rules&#13;
for Veeranam Tank that protect the irrigation rights of the farmers in the ayacut (command area) in bad&#13;
and very bad years (failure of one monsoon and both monsoons, respectively).&#13;
45.    GOTN has continued public consultation on the irrigation rights issue. On February 4, 1995,&#13;
PWD organized a meeting of farmers in Cuddalore to publicize the new operating rules and solicit&#13;
comments. The meeting attendees passed resolutions expressing their satisfaction with the operating&#13;
rules as sufficient to protect their rights, and their support for the New Veeranam Project. GOTN plans&#13;
further consultation activities: (i) publication of a Tamil-language brochure on the operating rules; and&#13;
(ii) a series of additional meetings (with the assistance of an NGO) so that a sample of farmers and farm&#13;
laborers that fully represent the ayacut can discuss the rules and express their opinions.&#13;

            India - Second Madras Water Supply Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Madras has the lowest level of water
            supply of all metropolitan areas in India and great
            susceptibility to drought. The project's major
            objectives are to: 1) provide water from a reliable source
            within the State to Madras on an urgent basis; 2) improve
            the distribution of water within Madras; and 3) strengthen
            conservation. The project will consist of the following: 1)
            source works at the existing Veeranam irrigation tank to the
            south of Madras; 2) a transmission pipeline from Veeranam to
            Madras, a distance of 235 km, with associated treatment and
            pumping facilities; 3) continuation of distribution
            improvements within Madras being undertaken in the First
            Madras Supply Project; 4) a water conservation program
            including physical works such as leak detection and repairs
            and tariff increases to encourage more efficient use of
            water; and 5) technical assistance in the form of project
            preparation and implementation support. Adequate steps will
            be taken to ensure people adversely affected benefit from
            the project where this is possible and otherwise are made no
            worse off as a result. To remove possible farmer resistance
            to the proposals at Veeranam, a new regime to regulate the
            flow has been introduced following consultation under which
            the irrigation flows will exceed those that would otherwise
            have occurred.
