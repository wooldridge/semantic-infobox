 Note 1-Organization&#13;
&#13;
 The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) was established on&#13;
 October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes&#13;
 between States and nationals of other States. On February 13, 1967, the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction andDevelopment (the Bank) andthe Centre entered intoAdministrative Arrange-&#13;
ments which were effective as of the date ofthe establishment of the Centre.The Memorandumof&#13;
Administrative Arrangements (the Memorandum) provides that, except.tothe extent that the Cen-&#13;
tre may b e reimbursedby the parties to proceedings for fees and expenses of members of Con-&#13;
ciliation Commissions, Arbitral Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the Bank shall provide facilities&#13;
and services to the Centre, as described inNotes 2 and 3.&#13;
&#13;
Note 2-Summnary of Significant Accounting Policies&#13;
&#13;
Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation: The financial statements have&#13;
beenprepared inaccordance with generally accepted accounting principles inthe United States&#13;
and with InternationdAccounting Standards. Such financial statements are presented in accor-&#13;
dance with Statement of FinancialAccounting Standard No. 117,"Financial StatementsofNot-For-&#13;
Profit-Organizations" (SFAS No. 117). SFAS No. 117 requires that net assets are classified in&#13;
accordance with donor restrictions;however,there are nonet assets as ofJune 30, 1998 and 1997.&#13;
&#13;
Use ofEstimates: The preparation of financial statements inconformity with generally accepted&#13;
accountingprinciples requires management to make estimates andassumptions that affect the re-&#13;
ported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the&#13;
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during&#13;
the reporting period.Actual results could differ from these estimates.&#13;
&#13;
Cash Equivalents: The Centre considers all highlyliquiddebt investments purchased with an&#13;
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#13;
&#13;
Value of services provided by the Bank and in-kind contributions: Inaccordance with State-&#13;
ment of FinancialAccounting StandardNo. 116,"Accountingfor Contributions Received and Con-&#13;
tributions Made," the value of services provided by the Bank is determined by the estimated fair&#13;
value of these services and is recorded by the Centre as in-kindcontributions and also as ex-&#13;
penses of the Centre.&#13;

         (2) other administrative services and facilities, such as travel,communications, office accom-&#13;
             modations,furniture, equipment, supplies and printing.&#13;
&#13;
    Revenue recognition from arbitration proceedings: The Centre does not haveresources of its&#13;
    own.The Centre's direct expenses attributable to arbitration proceedings are borne by the par-&#13;
    ties inaccordance withthe Centre'sAdministrative andFinancialRegulations (Regulations). Inac-&#13;
    cordance with these Regulations,the Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance&#13;
    deposits with the Centre from time to time to defray these anticipated expenses.Accordingly the&#13;
    Centre recognizes revenues from these exchange transactions duringthe period of and to the ex-&#13;
    tent of expenses incurredrelated to arbitration proceedings: If,after the completion of an arbitra-&#13;
    tion proceeding, it is determinedthat there is a cashsurplus,such surplus shall b e refundedto the&#13;
    parties inproportion to the amounts advanced by each party to the Centre.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 To International Centre for Settlement&#13;
      of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position of the International Centre for&#13;
 Settlement of InvestmentDisputes (the Centre) as ofJune 30, 1998,and the related statements of&#13;
 activities andcash flows for the year then ended.These financial statements are the responsibility&#13;
of the management of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Developm.ent (IBRD) and of&#13;
the Centre. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our&#13;
audit. The financial statements of the Centre for the year endedJune 30, 1991were audited by&#13;
other auditors whose report,datedJuly28, 1991,expressed an unquaiified opiniononthose state-&#13;
ments,&#13;
&#13;
We conducied our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards inthe IJnited&#13;
States of America and with the International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that&#13;
we plan and perform our audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial state-&#13;
ments are free of material misstatement.An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence&#13;
supportingthe amounts anddisclosures inthe financial statements.An audit also includes assess-&#13;
ingthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,as well as&#13;
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.We believe that our audit provides a rea-&#13;
sonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
Inour opinion, such 1998financial statements present fairly inallmaterial respects,the financial&#13;
position of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes as ofJune 30, 1998, and&#13;
the changes inits net assets and cash flows for the year then ended inconformity with generally&#13;
accepted accounting principles inthe UnitedStates ofAmerica andwith InternationalAccounting&#13;
Standards,&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This report concerns the International
            Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Fiscal
            year 1998 was a notable one for the Centre in many respects.
            In this period, ICSID's membership has continued to
            grow and its activities have continued to be enhanced in
            virtually every dimension. During the year, there were 19
            cases before the Centre. This report provides information on
            activities of the Centre and on disputes pending before
            ICSID, as well as articles on topics of current interest. In
            the course of the year, three new releases for the
            Centre's seven-volume collection of Investment Treaties
            were published. Today ICSID has gained recognition as a
            leading institution in the area of international investment
            law, and its experience will no doubt contribute
            significantly to the future development of that law. The
            achievements of ICSID at the close of fiscal year 1998 show
            that it is rapidly fulfilling, if not surpassing, the role
            envisaged for it by its founders.
