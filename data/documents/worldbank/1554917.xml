ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper presents estimates of efficiency and social accounting&#13;
prices for commodities and factors of production in Egypt which are&#13;
appropriate for the period 1979-1985. Shadow price estimates for commodities&#13;
are based on a modified input-output method which decomposes domestic supply&#13;
prices into foreign exchange and primary factor content. Particular attention&#13;
has also been given to modeling of the market for skilled and unskilled labor&#13;
in the formal sector and to determination of the shadow wage.&#13;

Chapter 1: Introduction and Summary&#13;
1.1 Concepts and Assumptions&#13;
This paper presents estimates of shadow, or as we shall frequently&#13;
call them, accounting prices for goods and factors of production in Egypt. In&#13;
this chapter we briefly introduce the methodology which provides the framework&#13;
for our estimates and discuss the major results. Chapters 2 to 4 provide&#13;
detailed information on the data, assumptions and methods employed in our work.&#13;
Shadow prices may differ from prices observed in the market because&#13;
of non-competitive behavior, externalities, and distortions introduced by&#13;
government policy. In Egypt, as in many developing economies, policy induced&#13;
distortions are perhaps the most pervasive and at the same time the most&#13;
complex cause of divergence between market and shadow prices. In these&#13;
circumstances market signals may provide an inadequate guide for investment&#13;
planning and project appraisal, and the need for a consistent set of prices&#13;
which reflect the resource costs and social benefits of a proposed course of&#13;
action becomes apparent.&#13;
The general procedure used to estimate the shadow price of a given&#13;
resource is to determine the change in social welfare which occurs as a result&#13;
of withdrawing one unit of the good or factor from its existing employment in&#13;
the economy. This "welfare accounting" approach implies that accounting&#13;
prices depend on both the objectives of the country and on the economic&#13;
environment within which the marginal changes take place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
There exist in the literature two basic approaches to the social&#13;
valuation of resources. The first argues that shadow prices should be defined&#13;
solely with respect to the obj c-time-o-f-economic-elfficiency.  Other objectives&#13;
are recognized but the use of policies to achieve those objectives is&#13;
generally perceived as having an economic cost valued at efficiency prices.&#13;
An alternative approach is to build into shadow price estimates the weights&#13;
attached to various national goals. Benefits accruing to different income&#13;
groups, for example, may be assigned different-values taking into account the&#13;
objective of altering the income distribution, or savings may be valued&#13;
differently from consumption in circumstances where there are constraints on&#13;
achieving the desired level of investment and growth.&#13;
The approach adopted here is to provide-estimates of accounting&#13;
f prices based both on the efficiency criterion and on a limited set of other&#13;
goals.  In many instances, for example in evaluating the shadow prices of&#13;
commodities, the two sets of prices are nearly identical. There are, however,&#13;
some important parameters such as the shadow wage rate where efficiency prices&#13;
and social accounting prices may diverge significantly. In an economy like&#13;
Egypt's, where there is a long and extensive history of interventions by the&#13;
government designed to alter the distribution of income among contemporaries,&#13;
the need to have a consistent set of prices which reflect as closely as&#13;
possible the social gains and losses associated with changes in the&#13;
distribution of income is apparent. In the absence of such a set of prices,&#13;
it is impossible, for example, to arrive at a meaningful judgement concerning&#13;
the costs and benefits of the program of consumer subsidies.&#13;
If there are historical policy-imposed distortions in the economic&#13;
system, the estimation of shadow prices will vary depending on whether these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
distortions are expected to be removed. In calculating "first-best" shadow&#13;
prices one has to assume that all government imposed distortions will be&#13;
eliminated except insofar as they contribute to the optimal allocation of&#13;
resources. In this sense "shadow pricing" amounts to predicting the market&#13;
prices which would prevail when policies have been changed. "Second-best"&#13;
shadow prices, on the other hand, assume that existing non-optimal policies&#13;
will remain in effect during the period of the analysis. This is equivalent&#13;
to deriving the first-order conditions for welfare maximization with market&#13;
distortions acting as constraints.&#13;
We have in general assumed that the economic environment in Egypt&#13;
will not alter radically in the next few years, and the shadow prices we&#13;
estimate reflect the taxes, subsidies and other interventions prevailing in&#13;
the period 1979-1981,. although where there is evidence of changing policies,&#13;
we have attempted to take into account the emerging trend. This should not be&#13;
interpreted as implying that we view existing policies as necessary or&#13;
permanent; indeed; as we shall indicate below, our shadow prices provide&#13;
substantial information that can be used as a basis for designing policies to&#13;
remove many of the existing price distortions.&#13;
Given these assumptions, if all goods are (potentially) tradable, the&#13;
efficiency price (or opportunity cost) of-any commodity or factor is given by&#13;
the decline in national income expressed in terms of world prices which occurs&#13;
as a result of withdrawing the resource from alternative uses. 1/&#13;
1/ There are, of course, a number of restrictive assumptions including the&#13;
absence of quantative trade restrictions and monopoly power in&#13;
international trade which must be met, but these may be relaxed at the&#13;
cost of complicating somewhat the welfare accounting process. We deal in&#13;
greater detail with these issues in Chapter 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The justification for this valuation, rather than using domestic prices that&#13;
reflect consumers' marginal preferences, is that as long as the ratio of&#13;
domestic market prices to world prices is constant, consumer prices are&#13;
invariant with respect to changes in the allocation of resources. In other&#13;
words, it is possible to deal with the productive sphere of the economy&#13;
without having to worry about changes in the consumption sphere. Welfare&#13;
depends only on the level of purchasing power over the world's goods and&#13;
services and can be measured by national income denominated in world prices.&#13;
Because of the possibility of trade at fiscal world prices, resources should&#13;
be allocated so as to maximize production expressed in these world prices.&#13;
In social pricing changes in the incomes of various groups in the&#13;
society become relevant. Social benefits must be expressed in terms of a&#13;
common unit of account or numeraire. Any commodity or factor may be chosen&#13;
for this purpose - in the efficiency pricing criterion discussed above, we&#13;
have implicitly chosen foreign exchange as the unit of account - but once it&#13;
is chosen all values must consistently be expressed in terms of the numeraire.&#13;
In this paper, we follow the now well established practice of valuing&#13;
all commodities and factors in terms of their impact on uncommitted foreign&#13;
exchange in the hands of the Egyptian government. 1/ Thus we retain as the&#13;
basis of our welfare accounting system the use of international prices, but we&#13;
add the additional consideration that incomes at international prices accruing&#13;
to various groups in the society may be more or less valuable than uncommitted&#13;
foreign exchange in the hands of the government. The social price of a&#13;
1/ This is the Little and Mirrlees (1974) unit of account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
commodity is, therefore, equal to the efficiency price plus an adjustment for&#13;
the distributional impact of altering the existing allocation of resources.&#13;
(See Squire and van der Tak (1976)).&#13;
Social pricing will bias project selection according to the value&#13;
judgements implicit in the adjustments made to reflect social objectives.&#13;
First, we simply attempt to establish the value of average private consumption&#13;
relative to uncommitted social income. This value depends on the uses to&#13;
which the government puts its income and on the change in the value of average&#13;
consumption resulting from these uses. In cases where the value of public&#13;
income exceeds the value assigned to average consumption, social prices&#13;
reflect the objective of increasing uncommitted public income. The accounting&#13;
prices which we estimate based on adjustments for changes in the levels of&#13;
public sector and average private sector incomes we have called "extended&#13;
efficiency prices". Secondly, we have considered the case in which welfare&#13;
weights are assigned to the incomes of various classes of private individuals.&#13;
Hence, it is not only the distribution between public sector income and&#13;
private consumption which matters, but also the distribution of private sector&#13;
income among individuals. In this system of shadow prices, it is possible for&#13;
the welfare weights assigned to some classes of individuals to exceed the&#13;
value of public sector income, and the shadow prices derived from these&#13;
weights reflect the objective of increasing the incomes of certain classes of&#13;
private individuals relative to both their contemporaries and to public sector&#13;
income. We have called the set of accounting prices based on this set of&#13;
objectives "social accounting prices".&#13;
Not all commodities are traded, however.    It is the presence of&#13;
non-traded goods that constitutes the real challenge to shadow pricing.&#13;
Because the price for non-tradables is set in the local market, changes in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6&#13;
supply of a non-traded commodity can affect domestic consumer prices.&#13;
Moreover, as a result of market imperfections or policy induced distortions&#13;
(for example indirect taxes), the marginal value of non-traded goods to&#13;
consumers may differ from their marginal production cost. This divergence&#13;
does not create problems in the case of traded goods because their supply can-&#13;
always be increased at a fixed world price. In the case of non-tradables,&#13;
however, it is important to know whether an incremental unit of the good is&#13;
obtained by an increase in production, by depriving other users, or by a&#13;
combination of the two. Depending on which of the three cases applies, the&#13;
shadow price of such goods may be the demand price (marginal social benefit),&#13;
the supply price (marginal social cost), or may lie between the two.&#13;
There are no fully satisfactory solutions to dealing with these&#13;
complications short of trying to build a full empirical general equilibrium&#13;
model of the economy. We have generally assumed that incremental changes in&#13;
the demand for non-traded goods are met by an increase in supply, and that the&#13;
per unit cost of production is constant. The result of these two simplifying&#13;
assumptions is to allow us to approximate the shadow price of a non-traded&#13;
good by its marginal social cost of production. Moreover, because the&#13;
long-run supply curve is horizontal shadow prices are again independent of the&#13;
structure of domestic preferences.    This in turn allows us to express the&#13;
marginal social cost of production of a non-traded commodity in terms of the&#13;
costs of the inputs which are needed for its production. Some of these inputs&#13;
will be traded commodities that can be valued at world prices. Others will be&#13;
non-traded inputs and finally there are, of course, primary inputs in the form&#13;
of capital, land and labor. Wherever we encounter a non-traded input in this&#13;
chain, we decompose the cost of producing it until finally we are left with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7&#13;
only primary_fa-aco.r_ costs and traded input costs. In this way the&#13;
international prices of traded commodities determine the efficiency prices of&#13;
tradables and primary inputs which in turn determine the efficiency prices of&#13;
non-tradables. Extended efficiency prices and social accounting prices of&#13;
non-tradables differ from their efficiency prices only insofar as changes in&#13;
the output of non-tradables affect the distribution of incomes between the&#13;
public sector and various private individuals.&#13;
Our welfare accounting approach to the estimation of factor shadow&#13;
prices is essentially partial equilibrium in nature. In general equilibrium&#13;
consumption and production of most goods would be expected to change as a&#13;
result of withdrawing a unit of any resource from the rest of the economy.&#13;
Estimating these changes in a world of many commodities would be a formidable&#13;
task. One alternative is to work with a limited number of aggregate commodity&#13;
groups, such as imports, exports and non-tradables. The conditions for&#13;
aggregation, however, are very stringent and the possibility of estimating&#13;
operationally useful shadow price parameters from such an aggregate approach&#13;
is quite limited.&#13;
A more practical alternative is to investigate the activities from&#13;
which the factor is likely to be withdrawn in order to estimate the change in&#13;
national income measured in terms of the unit of account which would occur as&#13;
a result of withdrawing the factor from its alternative employment. This&#13;
procedure requires considerable knowledge of how the relevant product and&#13;
factor markets work, and to the extent that the government is directly&#13;
involved in allocating resources, it also requires an understanding of how its&#13;
decisions are likely to be made.    This is the approach which we have adopted&#13;
to estimate the social opportunity cost of such factors of production as&#13;
skilled and unskilled labor and capital.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

1.2 Method&#13;
If the benefits and cost of projects are to be consistently and&#13;
efficiently weighed up according to the principles outlined above, they must&#13;
be expressed in terms of a common unit of account. What we have done in the&#13;
remainder of this paper is to show the methods by which we express the&#13;
accounting prices of many commodities and factors of production in terms of&#13;
our unit of account which is uncommitted foreign exchange in the hands of the&#13;
Egyptian government. By foreign exchange we mean currency which is&#13;
convertable into any other. For conveience, we shall express foreign exchange&#13;
in terms of its Egyptian Pound equivalent, but we are still referring to&#13;
foreign exchange and could express our shadow prices in dollars or any other&#13;
foreign currency. 1/ We do not assume that all benefits and costs of a&#13;
project take the form of actual increases or decreases in the foreign exchange&#13;
reserves of the public sector. Rather we attempt to express the actual&#13;
benefits and costs in terms of equivalent value to such increases or decreases.&#13;
Our results could be expressed either as absolute accounting prices&#13;
or as the ratio of accounting prices to market prices (accounting ratios).&#13;
Although we give a few absolute accounting prices, for example, the shadow&#13;
wage and the accounting rate of interest, all of our results are expressed as&#13;
accounting ratios as these are generally more useful in giving an overall view&#13;
of the structure of price distortions in the economy.&#13;
(a) Valuing Commodities&#13;
Given our assumptions,-the social value of commodities is equal to the&#13;
value at international prices of delivering them to a representative project.&#13;
1/ In the case of multiple exchange rates it is important to choose a&#13;
consistent accounting rule for the conversion of "border pounds" into&#13;
foreign currency values. A discussion of these issues and our accounting&#13;
rules is presented in Section 2.2 below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
For tradable goods, this consists of the world price of the commodity plus the&#13;
value at international prices of the port charges, transportation and handling&#13;
required to deliver it to the user. In order to find the equivalent value at&#13;
international prices of non-tradables, given our assumption of constant&#13;
marginal costs, we decompose costs of production into tradable inputs,&#13;
non-tradable inputs and the costs of a class of inputs which we shall define&#13;
as "primary inputs", for example, labor and foreign exchange. We know the&#13;
shadow prices of the traded commodities used as inputs; further, we can break&#13;
down the non-tradable inputs into their traded, non-traded, and primary input&#13;
cost components. If we move through several rounds of analysis in this&#13;
fashion, we can reduce the social cost of any commodity to its equivalent cost&#13;
in terms of tradable commodities (foreign exchange) and primary inputs. This&#13;
is simply an application of input-output analysis. The shadow price of the&#13;
commodity is then given by the sum of the shadow value of traded inputs plus&#13;
the shadow value of the primary inputs.&#13;
The problem then reduces to estimating the shadow prices of primary&#13;
inputs. Unfortunately, the shadow prices of primary inputs themselves depend&#13;
on changes in national income (or public sector income) denominated in terms&#13;
of foreign exchange, so that they depend ultimately on the shadow prices of&#13;
commodities. The solution to this simultaneity problem is simple in&#13;
principle; all we need to do is to build a model which will simultaneously&#13;
provide the shadow prices of commodities and factors. In practice it is&#13;
difficult to implement in a world of many goods and factors.&#13;
The main device which we have used is first to express the cost of&#13;
any commodity as the sum of its direct plus indirect primary input costs (at&#13;
market prices). Because all production functions are linear, the total&#13;
(direct plus indirect) primary input content of all commodities may be&#13;
determined by the solution to a large number of simultaneous linear equations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(see Chapter 2). We then make rough estimates of the accounting-ratios for&#13;
the primary inputs, and multiply the total primary input costs by these&#13;
accounting ratios. This gives us corresponding accounting ratios for&#13;
commodities. We then use these preliminary accounting ratios for commodities&#13;
to arrive at better estimates of the accounting ratios for primary inputs and&#13;
by iteration arrive at a mutually consistant. set of accounting ratios for&#13;
everything.&#13;
The essentials of the method are illustrated in Table 1-1. Consider&#13;
a project which uses I.E 100 worth of packaging materials which are imported as&#13;
an input. The customs duty on these is 30 percent, assuming that no special&#13;
rebate is allowed, and the port handling, transportation, and handling margins&#13;
are as listed in the table. By our input-output method, we may convert these&#13;
direct inputs into the direct plus indirect primary input cost coefficients&#13;
listed in column (2). We then multiply the total primary input cost&#13;
coefficients by their respective accounting ratios and arrive at a weighted&#13;
average accounting ratio of .811. The total cost of packaging materials to&#13;
the project is therefore LE 81 at border prices.&#13;
Several points may be noted. The accounting ratio for foreign&#13;
exchange is simply 1.00 since this is our unit of account. The accounting&#13;
ratios for taxes, and subsidies are zero, since these are simply transfers&#13;
within the public sector. The accounting ratios for capital inputs reflect&#13;
their foreign exchange costs; those for labor reflect the estimated change in&#13;
national income evaluated at border prices which would occur as a result of&#13;
diverting a unit of labor from its existing allocation, expressed as a&#13;
percentage of the market wage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Once we have the accounting ratios for a large number of goods and&#13;
services we need not always increase the size of our input-output table to&#13;
find an accounting ratio for a single new commodity. If the accounting ratios&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
to provide an estimate of the accounting ratio of the new good or service. As&#13;
an illustration we include the estimated direct-only accounting ratio for&#13;
packaging materials in Table 1-1. The two accounting ratios are of course&#13;
identical.&#13;
The choice of primary inputs is to some extent a matter of&#13;
convenience. Our list is given in Table 1-2. Ultimately we wish to express&#13;
everything in terms of P1, costs in terms of the unit of account, and PlO and&#13;
Pll transfers within the public sector (social surplus), so these must be&#13;
included. In between, we put items which cannot be easily expressed as linear&#13;
combinations of other accounting ratios -- for example labor, and non-traded&#13;
agricultural products -- or about whose values we are particularly uncertain&#13;
(to facilitate sensitivity analysis) -- e.g. extra incomes of the private&#13;
sector --, and we include capital inputs for the convenience of knowing the&#13;
direct plus indirect social cost of capital per unit of output. Our list&#13;
includes all of the important items for which the problem of weighting&#13;
benefits in social pricing arises. It is therefore relatively easy for&#13;
someone who would like to try alternative weights to work out the effects of&#13;
taking a different weighting scheme.&#13;
(b) Valuing Factors of Production&#13;
The same principles which governed our estimates of accounting prices&#13;
for commodities apply to our estimates of the accounting prices for factors of&#13;
production. In a proper cost benefit analysis there are no capital inputs per&#13;
se. All inputs and outputs are dated with respect to time, and a rate of&#13;
discount is used to make them comensurable. The rate of discount appropriate&#13;
to our analysis is that which reflects the rate of fall in the welfare value&#13;
of the numeraire over time. For efficiency pricing this is the marginal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
productivity of public sector investment at international prices. In social&#13;
pricing, it is the Accounting Rate of Interest (ARI), the rate of decline in&#13;
the welfare value of public sector income dg,ominated in terms of foreign&#13;
exchange.   In an economy in full capital market'-equilibrium, and with the&#13;
desired income distribution, the two rates of d'is6ount will be equal and will&#13;
equal the consumption discount rate. Where constraints exist on the&#13;
distribution of income or on the allocation of national income between&#13;
consumption and savings these discount rates will differ. The relationship&#13;
among them and estimates of their likely magnitudes are further discussed in&#13;
Chapter 3. In general it is expected that the Accounting Rate of Interest&#13;
will lie below the marginal productivity of capital at border prices and above&#13;
the Consumption Rate of Interest. We have found this to be the case in Egypt.&#13;
The shadow wage is the change in the numeraire value of national&#13;
income which occurs when a marginal worker is taken from his existing&#13;
employment and placed in a project created job. It consists of three&#13;
elements: (i) the efficiency cost of labor which is the decline in national&#13;
income expressed in border prices which occurs as a result of withdrawing the&#13;
worker from his previous employment (the value of his marginal product at&#13;
border prices); (ii) the cost of providing the resources to meet the increased&#13;
consumption of the worker and his household arising out of any excess of wages&#13;
in his new employment over those in his previous employment; (iii) the social&#13;
value assigned to the benefit accruing to the worker and his household as a&#13;
result of the increase in household income. Efficiency prices consider only&#13;
element (i) of the shadow wage. For extended efficiency prices and social&#13;
accounting prices we must also estimate elements (ii) and (iii). This is done&#13;
in the second half of Chapter 3 and applied to the problem of determining the&#13;
shadow wage in Chapter 4.&#13;

1.3 The Main Results and Some Implications&#13;
The main results of our analysis are summarized in Table 1-2 and in&#13;
Figure 1-1. Table 1-2 presents accounting ratios for primary inputs and for a&#13;
number of categories of expenditure, as well as the values of a number of&#13;
distributional parameters which are intermediate inputs into the estimation of&#13;
social accounting prices. Figure 1-1 summarizes the frequency distributions&#13;
of accounting ratios for the'130 commodities included in the study and for&#13;
important subsets of these commodities.&#13;
The most obvious point which'emerges is that the median accounting&#13;
ratio is close to one.   Those familiar with other studies of (border)&#13;
accounting prices or effective protection in developing countries may find&#13;
this result striking. In most countries, protection of a wide range of&#13;
tradable consumer and intermediate goods results in accounting ratios for.&#13;
tradable commodities which are below unity, often by a wide margin. The&#13;
median of our sample of 94 traded commodities is .97, and fully 43 percent of&#13;
the accounting ratios for tradables exceed one. Since non-traded goods are&#13;
linear combinations of tradables and primary inputs it is not very surprising&#13;
to find that their accounting ratios are also close to and often exceed unity.&#13;
What is the source of this shadow pricing phenomenon in Egypt? Since&#13;
the opening of the Egyptian economy in 1973, the government has tried to&#13;
insulate certain consumer goods and producer intermediates from changes in&#13;
world prices and in the nominal exchange rate via a system of price controls&#13;
and subsidies. Among these commodities are domestically consumed petroleum&#13;
products, basic agricultural staples, including wheat and other food grains,&#13;
oils, sugar and meat, locally produced and imported intermediate products such&#13;
as steel reinforcing rods, cement, and other construction materials, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
consumer products produced by the public enterprises including shoes,&#13;
clothing, and cotton cloth. Various rationing schemes have been implemented&#13;
to control excess demand in the markets for these commodities and prices have&#13;
not been allowed to increase in line with international prices.&#13;
At the same time, agricultural policy has permitted the coexistance&#13;
of implicit taxes via fixed producer prices set at levels below the import and&#13;
export parity prices of agricultural commodities combined with subsidies on&#13;
major agricultural inputs. One consequence of this structure of subsidies and&#13;
taxes has been to make the accounting ratios for a large number of&#13;
agricultural inputs and outputs greater than one. A possible exception to&#13;
this rule is the accounting ratio for extra long staple cotton. Our analysis&#13;
in Chapter Appendix 2-2 indicates that the farmgate price of extra long staple&#13;
cotton, a product over which Egypt exercises monopoly power, may lie above its&#13;
marginal export revenue, although our best estimate of the accounting ratio is&#13;
about 1.17.&#13;
The overall impact of the system of taxes and subsidies is apparent&#13;
from Figure 1-1. The median of our full distribution of 130 commodities is&#13;
.99. If this is typical of the central tendency of the distribution of&#13;
accounting ratios for all commodities in Egypt (including those whose&#13;
accounting ratios we have failed to estimate) it indicates that, on average,&#13;
there is little overvaluation of the Egyptian currency resulting from the&#13;
structure of nominal protection. In other words, the shadow exchange rate for&#13;
the Egyptian economy lies very close to the official exchange rate. This&#13;
result is a consequence of the existing structure of taxes and subsidies in&#13;
Egypt. Since the shadow exchange rate in the Little-Mirrlees sense is simply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a'summary measure of the relationship between world prices and domestic&#13;
prices, our finding that it is close to the official rate (that is that the&#13;
standard conversion factor is close to one) indicates that the distortionary&#13;
effects of import duties, export taxes and consumer subsidies approximately&#13;
cancel out in the aggregate. If the existing structure of protection were to&#13;
be eliminated and domestic prices were permitted to adjust to their border&#13;
price equivalents, there would be about as many domestic prices that would&#13;
rise as there would be prices that would decline in the absence of any&#13;
adjustment in the nominal exchange rate. It is likely then that there would&#13;
be very little need for an exchange rate adjustment to compensate for the&#13;
change in the pattern of taxes and subsidies. This result contrasts with the&#13;
more usual estimates of standard conversion factors which are less than&#13;
unity. In those cases prior to any nominal exchange rate adjustment the&#13;
prices of most goods would decline to their international equivalents. The&#13;
nominal exchange rate would then increase to restore equilibrium in the goods&#13;
market.&#13;
It is important to note here that the exchange rate adjustment&#13;
discussed with respect to changes in the structure of protection is a&#13;
comparative static one, reflecting changes in the levels of tariffs, subsidies&#13;
and price controls. Our accounting ratios fail to provide any information on&#13;
the equally important dynamic question of possible exchange rate adjustments&#13;
in response to long-term changes in the availability of external resources.&#13;
Because Egypt derives a significant portion of it foreign exchange from such&#13;
"exogenous" sources as rents paid on petroleum exports and the Suez Canal as&#13;
well as from workers' remittances, changes in the availability of these&#13;
resources, for example arising from exhaustion of petroleum reserves, may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
result in the need for an adjustment of the exchange rate. Any resulting&#13;
change in the relative prices of traded and non-traded goods would need to be&#13;
reflected in our shadow pricing system. This problem of possible shifts in&#13;
long-term resource availabilities is considered in a paper which will appear&#13;
as a companion to this study. 1/&#13;
Focusing on the median, however, tends to obscure important sectoral&#13;
variations in the structure of relative accounting and market prices in&#13;
Egypt. There is great variability in the accounting ratios. The standard&#13;
deviation of the scatter of 130 commodities is 1.70 and exceeds the mean by&#13;
ten percent. Clearly, the process of administrative price determination in&#13;
Egypt has resulted in extreme variability in the relationship between market&#13;
prices and opportunity costs. Thus, any summary measure of the pattern of&#13;
price distinctions such as the standard conversion factor or the shadow&#13;
exchange rate marks important sectoral variations in the relationship between&#13;
accounting prices and market.prices.&#13;
These general observations are borne out by a more detailed&#13;
examination of certain subsets of commodities. The median value for exports&#13;
is .98 which exceeds slightly that for importables of .96. In both cases, the&#13;
standard deviation is less than the mean, indicating that the distributions&#13;
are somewhat more compact than the overall distribution.&#13;
The closeness of the median accounting ratios for importables and&#13;
exportables indicates that the expected gains from shifting resources within&#13;
the traded goods sector from import competing to export production are likely&#13;
to be small. Reductions in the output of one sector carry a social cost which&#13;
is almost precisely offset by the social gains from the increase in the other&#13;

sector' s output. The median values do mask substantial variations in&#13;
individual accounting ratios, however, and therefore fail to provide&#13;
sufficiently accurate measures of the opportunity costs of individual&#13;
commodities. Proposed investments in the traded goods sector should be&#13;
appraised individually. Summary conversion factors are inadequate guides to&#13;
the social costs and benefits of any particular investment. Non-traded goods&#13;
and services are more closely grouped (coefficient of variation .54) which&#13;
reflects the fact that they are the weighted averages of a large number of&#13;
items. Both the mean and the median of the distribution of non-traded goods,&#13;
however, exceed one by a substantial margin (1.33 and 1.21, respectively).&#13;
When we recall that the accounting ratio for a non-traded good is the ratio of&#13;
its marginal social cost of production to the domestic market price, the&#13;
impact of the system of subsidies on intermediate goods and on the&#13;
relationship between market and social profitability becomes apparent. Those&#13;
activities which intensively use such non-traded goods and services as&#13;
electricity, construction, and road and rail transport receive substantial&#13;
implicit subsidies relative to the opportunity cost of providing those&#13;
inputs. If the accounting ratio applicable to their output is close to the&#13;
median value of one, it is quite likely that profits at market prices will&#13;
exceed social profits. Moreover, the fact that private costs are below social&#13;
costs for these items may encourage excessive substitution of these inputs for&#13;
others relative to the optimum input proportions at social accounting prices. 1/&#13;
1/ It is perhaps useful to re-emphasize here that our accounting ratios for&#13;
non-traded goods are supply prices and hence are appropriate to evaluating&#13;
the social cost of an input. They do not provide the accounting value&#13;
appropriate to the output of a project producing the non-tradable. This&#13;
is set by the demand price for-the commodity converted into equivalent&#13;
value in terms of the unit of account&#13;

The relationship between the median accounting ratios for non-traded&#13;
goods and the standard conversion factor has an important implication for&#13;
judgements concerning the existing allocation of resources between tradables&#13;
and non-tradables. The marginal social benefit accruing from the production&#13;
of a non-traded good is measured by domestic willingness to pay converted into&#13;
the numeraire. A first approximation to willingness to pay in terms of the&#13;
unit of account is given by the product of the domestic price and the standard&#13;
conversion factor. 1/ Because the standard conversion factor is close to one,&#13;
the domestic price is a fairly good approximation of marginal social benefit.&#13;
We know from our estimates of accounting ratios for non-traded goods that&#13;
marginal social costs exceed marginal private costs for the typical non-traded&#13;
good in Egypt. Hence, at the margin, social costs exceed social benefits for&#13;
the typical non-traded activity. If the existing structure of taxes and&#13;
subsidies were removed, the supply curve for non-tradables would shift upward&#13;
and we would expect a rise in the domestic price of non-tradables and a&#13;
reduction in their output. Thus relative to a distortion free environment,&#13;
there is over production of non-tradables at the expense of traded goods&#13;
producing activities.&#13;
A similar argument may be advanced concerning petroleum products sold&#13;
domestically. The median accounting ratio for these products is 5.88. This&#13;
means that for each pound spent on petroleum products in Egypt, the&#13;
opportunity cost in terms of foreign exchange earnings foregone is&#13;
approximately six pounds. It is difficult to find a more dramatic example of&#13;
1/ We could achieve greater precision by employing a demand price conversion&#13;
factor appropriate to the non-traded commodity in question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the divergence, between market and accounting prices. Proposed investments&#13;
which are intensiye in the use of petroleum products will tend to use them&#13;
excessively relative-to appropriate factor proportions at accounting prices&#13;
and will have higher levels of private than social profitability.&#13;
The most striking aspect of the accounting ratios for organized&#13;
sector labor is the great difference in the ratio of the shadow wage to the&#13;
market wage for skilled and unskilled labor. The shadow wage for skilled&#13;
labor exceeds the market wage, while that for unskilled labor is between&#13;
one-half and three fourths of the market wage depending on the nature of the&#13;
weighting scheme used to evaluate distributional benefits. These differences&#13;
reflect the nature of the market for skilled and unskilled labor in Egypt.&#13;
Substantial migration of workers in skilled jobs to other Arab countries has&#13;
resulted in significant tightening of the market for skilled labor.    The&#13;
marginal cost in terms of foregone remittances of reducing external migration&#13;
by one skilled worker exceeds the domestic wage; hence, the accounting ratio&#13;
for skilled workers drawn from the pool of potential migrants exceeds one.&#13;
Interestingly, the accounting ratio for skilled workers drawn from alternative&#13;
employment within Egypt is also close to one at efficiency prices and extended&#13;
efficiency prices. This reflects the fact that wages in the market for&#13;
skilled labor approximate the marginal value product of labor at market&#13;
prices. Since the standard conversion factor is close to one, the market wage&#13;
is a good estimate of the marginal value product at accounting prices.&#13;
Because there is no slack in the market for skilled labor, any&#13;
increase in the domestic demand for skilled workers should give rise to&#13;
bidding up of the skilled wage. This will result in a transfer of income from&#13;
consumers and producers of commodities intensive in the use of skilled labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
to skilled workers. We have estimated that on average consumers of the&#13;
products of skilled workers are less well off than skilled workers&#13;
themselves. Thus, any bidding up of wages generates a welfare cost which is&#13;
reflected in our estimate of the social accounting wage. At social accounting&#13;
prices, the sum of output foregone pLus the welfare cost of the bidding up of&#13;
wages exceeds the market wage and, surprisingly, the opportunity cost of&#13;
foregone migrants.&#13;
Since the shadow wage for skilled labor is a weighted average of the&#13;
opportunity cost of foregone migrants and of skilled workers drawn from other&#13;
employment within Egypt, it must inevitably lie close to the market wage.&#13;
Given our most reasonable assumptions concerning the proportions of workers&#13;
drawn from each source, the accounting ratio for skilled labor exceeds one.&#13;
Turning to the market for unskilled labor, we find that although&#13;
there has been some tightening in the agricultural labor market, there remains&#13;
a substantial differential-between the earnings of a fully employed&#13;
agricultural laborer and the annual wage paid to unskilled workers in full&#13;
time employment in the public sector or private, formal-sector enterprise.&#13;
Given the competitive nature of the agricultural labor market, the annual wage&#13;
provides a reasonable estimate of the marginal value product of labor at&#13;
market prices. We believe that the accouting ratio applicable to this&#13;
estimate of opportunity cost is rather more than one, but it is not&#13;
sufficiently high to offset the rural-urban wage differential. Moreover,&#13;
because we believe that in Egypt, unlike most developing countries, there is&#13;
no significant difference in rural and urban costs of living, the higher wages&#13;
in formal sector employment commit the society to a substantial cost in terms&#13;
of the unit of account of providing for the increased consumption of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
worker and his household. At extended efficiency prices, this resource cost&#13;
is not fully offset by our estimate of the welfare gain; society would have&#13;
been better off if the committed consumption could have been retained as&#13;
public sector income. At social accounting prices, the welfare gain to the&#13;
household of the higher income almost precisely offsets the resource cost.&#13;
Thus the efficiency wage and the social accounting wage are approximately&#13;
equal. It is important to recall here that the accounting ratios for&#13;
unskilled labor apply only to full time employment in the urban or rural&#13;
formal sector. They should not be misinterpreted to imply that shadow wages&#13;
are lower than actual wages throughout the economy. Accounting ratios for&#13;
other types of employment and alternate wage rates could be worked out given&#13;
the data and methods in Chapter 3.&#13;
Given any of our accounting prices for unskilled labor, the&#13;
implications of the relationship between market and accounting prices are&#13;
clear. Market prices in Egypt discourage the adoption of labor intensive&#13;
techniques relative to the optimum choice of technique at accounting prices.&#13;
They encourage the substitution of skilled labor and capital for unskilled&#13;
labor and tend to raise the private profitability of enterprises which are&#13;
intensive in the use of skilled labor and capital above social returns.&#13;
Finally, we consider briefly the implications of our estimates of&#13;
discount rates. Our best guess for the consumption rate of interest of 5.5&#13;
percent per year reflects quite moderate assumptions about the decline in&#13;
social welfare resulting from marginal increases in income (the elasticity of&#13;
the marginal valuation of income) and a pure rate time preference of one&#13;
percent. On the other hand, it is also based on an assumption of sustained&#13;
growth of per capita income of between 4 and 5 percent in the 1980's,&#13;
reflecting our assessment of Egypt's growth potential and moderate optimism&#13;
about the pace of policy reform. Our consumption discount rate is high,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
therefore, because when incomes are growing rapidly maginal increases in the&#13;
future ought to be worth relatively less than the same increase in the present.&#13;
The consumption rate of interest, however, is not the appropriate&#13;
rate of discount to use in project evaluation. Our numeraire is uncommitted&#13;
public income denominated in foreign exchange, not consumption. Thus, the&#13;
rate of discount appropriate to projects evaluated at shadow prices is the&#13;
Accounting Rate of Interest (ARI), which may be expressed as the sum of the&#13;
CRI and the rate of change in the value of uncommitted public income relative&#13;
to average per capita consumption. In Chapter 3, we give our reasuns for&#13;
selecting 6 percent as the best estimate of the ARI.&#13;
With the Accounting Rate of Interest set at 6 percent and projects&#13;
evaluated in social prices, it is likely that more projects will be approved&#13;
than if the Bank's usual 10 percent cut-off rule is used for projects&#13;
appraised using only efficiency prices. Also, projects which have long&#13;
gestation periods and yield benefits far into the future will have a better&#13;
chance to be selected for implementation. We believe that policies which&#13;
shift resources in the public sector away from commitments to consumption&#13;
towards investment are desirable and hence, that the Accounting Rate of&#13;
Interest advocated is reasonable in light of Egypt's goals and constraints.&#13;
While we believe 6 percent to be a reasonable discount rate to govern Egypt's&#13;
investment program, it is of course a separate question whether the Bank&#13;
should use the same discount rate for its own projects. While it can be&#13;
argued that the Bank should limit itself to the "best" projects (in terms of&#13;
the ERR) it should also be stressed that use of higher discount rates biases&#13;
the selection process against projects with long gestation lags. Given that&#13;
the Bank is the institution providing loans with the longest maturities, these&#13;
may be the types of projects for which Bank financing may be most appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
The main lesson to be drawn from our estimates of accounting prices&#13;
is that in Egypt, as in many countries,.private profits provide an inadequate&#13;
indicator of the social profitaility of investment and of potential areas for&#13;
efficient competition in export or import markets. In Egypt, however, the&#13;
great variety and large number of interventions in product markets, and the&#13;
resulting great variability in the distribution of accounting ratios, means&#13;
that simple adjustments of market rates of return for general patterns of&#13;
distortions are also impossible. In economies, for example, where the typical&#13;
accounting ratio is less than one and the distribution is relatively compact,&#13;
it is almost uniformly true that projects producing exports for which the&#13;
international elasticity of demand is high and purchasing inputs on the&#13;
domestic market will have higher rates of return at accounting prices than at&#13;
market prices. If such projects are commercially viable, they are socially&#13;
desirable. In Egypt no such rule of thumb applies and each project must be&#13;
evaluated to determine its social profitability. This is due in large part to&#13;
the fact that Egyptian relative prices are seriously out of alignment with&#13;
international relative prices. It is, therefore, clear that in the longer&#13;
term there will be substantial social benefits to policies which seek to&#13;
adjust the pattern of domestic relative prices to reflect economic opportunity&#13;
costs. This will permit a greater concordance between commercial viability&#13;
and economic efficiency and thus assist in achieving an efficient allocation&#13;
of investment.&#13;

Chapter 2: Accounting Ratios for Commodities&#13;
This chapter outlines the methodology, data, and assumptions employed&#13;
in estimating the shadow prices, accounting ratios and factor cost&#13;
coefficients of more than one hundred goods in Egypt. It consists of four&#13;
sections. The first section describes the manner in which the production and&#13;
distribution costs of commodity inputs are transformed into their&#13;
direct-plus-indirect factor costs and thence into shadow prices. The second&#13;
section consists of discussion of the data and assumptions used in making the&#13;
estimates of the cost composition of tradable and non tradable goods. The&#13;
final two sections provide estimates of conversion factors for a number of&#13;
homogenous expenditure categories -- e.g. consumption, savings, investment and&#13;
the standard conversion factor -- which are required for future analysis.&#13;
2.1      The Valuation of Commodity Inputs&#13;
The method of estimating accounting prices followed in this paper is&#13;
an adaptation of a procedure which is now generally accepted in the literature&#13;
on social cost benefit analysis. 1/ The market prices of goods and services&#13;
are divided into their foreign exchange and domestic cost components; these&#13;
are then valued in terms of the numeraire (unit of account) and summed to give&#13;
the accounting or shadow price of the commodity. It is also possible to&#13;
describe the shadow price structure in terms of ratios of the shadow prices of&#13;
1/ See for example Scott, McArthur and Newbery (1976), Page (1976) or&#13;
Ray (1980).&#13;

commodities to their market prices. When data are given in terms of domestic&#13;
currency values rather than in terms of physical quantities this formulation -&#13;
entitled the "accounting ratio" is particularly convenient.&#13;
To estimate the marginal social cost of a commodity we begin by&#13;
distinguishing between two classes of inputs into its production, goods and&#13;
services and primary factors. Primary factors are inputs which have their&#13;
accounting prices determined outside the goods market - for example foreign&#13;
exchange, labor, and capital -- or which represent transfers of income -- for&#13;
example taxes/subsidies and incomes accruing to private individuals. The&#13;
choice of primary factors is somewhat arbitrary. Our list, along with&#13;
estimates of the accounting ratios applicable to each input, is contained in&#13;
Table 2-1. Ultimately we wish to express the costs/benefits of any commodity&#13;
in terms of P1, foreign exchange. The intervening inputs are designated&#13;
either because we wish to be able to test the sensitivity of our estimated&#13;
accounting ratio to assumptions made concerning their accounting prices or as&#13;
a matter of convenience in having the total (direct plus indirect) content of&#13;
the item for some of our analytical work. Thus, unlike other studies of this&#13;
type, we distinguish taxes and subsidies as separate input items in order to&#13;
trace the direct plus indirect effect of consumer subsidies on commodity&#13;
prices. Similarly, because we shall wish to use as a cost-benefit criterion&#13;
the DRC or resource cost ratio, capital inputs - buildings, machinery and&#13;
vehicles - are included as primary factors, rather than as direct commodity&#13;
inputs. Our list includes all of the important items for which the problem of&#13;
weighing benefits arises. Thus it is relatively simple to trace the impact of&#13;
alternative assumptions concerning the weights assigned on the system of&#13;
social prices.&#13;

The market price of an input is transformed into its shadow price in&#13;
two stages. First, the direct factor costs and costs of the commodity inputs&#13;
involved in supplying one LE of the good are estimated. For example, the&#13;
costs of supplying an imported input such as machinery spare parts to the&#13;
final purchaser will consist of the direct foreign exchange cost (cif value),&#13;
tariffs, transportation, port handling and the distributor's margin. The cost&#13;
composition of a non-traded good can be found in a similar manner.&#13;
In the second stage of the analysis the direct plus indirect factor&#13;
cost content of supplying the commodity is estimated by tracing the factor&#13;
cost of supplying the intermediate inputs into the production of the commodity&#13;
in question. The sum of the direct factor inputs and those used indirectly in&#13;
providing intermediate inputs are then multiplied by the relevant accounting&#13;
prices to determine the shadow price of the good or service.&#13;
The similarity of the method to input-output analysis is apparent,&#13;
but the construction of the input-output matrix for the economy proceeds along&#13;
somewhat different lines. The input-output accounting tableau appropriate for&#13;
this method appears in Figure 2.1. Those familiar with orthodox input-output&#13;
tables will recognize some important departures from the standard&#13;
presentation. First, goods are divided into the categories tradable and&#13;
non-tradable; and domestic activities sub-matrices are reported for each. In&#13;
accordance with the standard efficiency pricing methodology, tradable&#13;
activities are treated as if the marginal source of supply is represented by&#13;
changes in the demand for importables and/or the supply of exportables.&#13;
Import competing and export producing activities are dropped from the&#13;
input-output table and replaced by the transport and distribution and trade&#13;
and taxes sub-matrices which summarize the direct marginal social cost content&#13;
(at domestic market prices) of a unit increase in final demand.&#13;

For non-traded activities the Leontief column consists of four&#13;
components: (a) a tradable content vector, (b) a domestic activities vector,&#13;
(c) a transport and distribution vector, and (d) a value added vector.&#13;
Tradable inputs into non-traded activities are treated symmetrically with&#13;
tradable deliveries to final demand, since at the margin tradable imports have&#13;
their accounting prices fixed on the international market. Thus, the only&#13;
domestic activities rows which provide inputs into non-tradables are other&#13;
non-tradable activities.&#13;
The primary factors matrices show the foreign exchange and tax&#13;
content of tradable commodities (the trade and taxes sub-matrix) and the value&#13;
added content of non-tradable activities. The sum of any column across both&#13;
commodities and factors is LE ;.00 at market prices.&#13;
Let us denote the two input value matrices in Figure 2.1 as:&#13;
A = (a..) a square matrix (nxn) in which each of the a.. shows&#13;
the direct input of commodity i per unit of commodity j.&#13;
P = (P j) a rectangular matrix (pn) which shows the direct primary&#13;
factor inputs into the delivery of one LE of the good at market&#13;
prices.&#13;
Let the accounting ratio for each primary factor be defined as r    (s =&#13;
1,...P) and the commodity accounting ratios by f. (j = 1,.. .n).   Then in&#13;
matrix notation&#13;
f = Af + Pr                                                          (1)&#13;
in which f and r are the vectors of commodity and primary input accounting&#13;
ratios respectively. This yields&#13;
-A  P&#13;
F = (I-A)  Pr = Pr                                                   (2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
where P = (I-A)   P, the matrix of total direct plus indirect requirements of&#13;
primary inputs. Clearly, if we have estimates of the primary input accounting&#13;
ratios, the commodity accounting ratios follow quite simply, once the A and P&#13;
matrices have been specified. Since the parameter estimates of some of the&#13;
primary factor accounting ratios depend themselves on the commodity accounting&#13;
ratios - for example the shadow wage rate - it is necessary to follow an&#13;
iterative procedure. First, reasonable but arbitrary values are assigned to&#13;
the primary input categories and preliminary estimates of commodity accounting&#13;
ratios are derived. These are then used to estimate improved values of the&#13;
factor accounting prices and the process is repeated. Convergence to a&#13;
reasonably stable set of values can normally be achieved in two to three&#13;
iterations.&#13;
The estimates of direct and total factor costs and the accounting&#13;
ratios derived from them apply to the period 1979/80, although in some cases&#13;
it was necessary to refer to data from earlier years to provide a picture of&#13;
the cost composition of certain non-traded activities. The estimated&#13;
accounting ratios for the commodities evaluated by the above method are&#13;
presented in Table 2-2.&#13;

The 130 commodities in Table 2-2 are divided into six major groups -&#13;
tradable intermediates, agricultural inputs and outputs, petroleum products,&#13;
tradable urban consumer goods, tradable rural consumer goods, and&#13;
non-tradables. Our coverage of commodities includes all of the major SITC&#13;
three digit categories in Egypt's external trade statistics, major consumer&#13;
goods, and all of the non-tradable sectors represented in the 1977&#13;
input-output table. Thus the frequency distribution of accounting ratios in&#13;
Table 2-2 is quite representative of the overall relationship between&#13;
accounting and market prices in the Egyptian economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
A summary measure of the "typical" accounting ratio is the median of&#13;
the distribution of all 130 commodities which is .993. The mean is 1.549&#13;
indicating the effect of a number of commodities with extremely high ratios of&#13;
the accounting price to the market price. There are relatively few&#13;
commodities with low accounting ratios in our distribution, and these are&#13;
consumer goods which are typically heavily taxed, tobacco, coffee, tea and&#13;
alcohol. Because of the heavy subsidization of many consumer items, the&#13;
median accounting ratio for tradable consumer goods is .970. The median of&#13;
the distribution of petroleum products is 5.88 indicating the magnitude of the&#13;
subsidies to petroleum products. Subsidies and production taxes in the&#13;
agricultural sector are similarly indicated by the median of the distribution&#13;
of agricultural inputs and outputs of 1.28. The system of subsidies also&#13;
works its way through the structure of production and exerts a major influence&#13;
on the social marginal cost of non-traded commodities. Non-traded goods in&#13;
our sample have a median accounting ratio of 1.21, thus for the typical&#13;
non-traded good the accounting price exceeds its market price by approximately&#13;
21 percent.&#13;
Overall the picture which emerges is of a distribution of accounting&#13;
ratios characterized by high variance and a large incidence of values&#13;
exceeding unity. There are few heavily protected sectors of the Egyptian&#13;
economy, and in contrast to many developing countries there are a substantial&#13;
number of activities in which pricing policy has suppressed the domestic&#13;
market price below the shadow price. The most notable of these sectors is&#13;
petroleum, but accounting prices exceeding unity are also found in agriculture&#13;
and among subsidized urban consumer goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Before turning to a detailed discussion of data and the methods used&#13;
to establish the input structures of the commodities listed in Table 2-2, it&#13;
may be useful to review briefly a number of general issues which affect the&#13;
appropriateness of our methodology. These are the degree of tradability,&#13;
increasing returns to scale, variable relationships between international and&#13;
domestic prices, and inelastic world supply and demand. These topics also&#13;
introduce the important issues of the time perspective of the analysis and the&#13;
degree to which individual project analysts should undertake supplementary&#13;
shadow price estimates in addition to those presented here.&#13;
(a) The Degree of Tradability&#13;
A crucial underpinning of the border price rule on which our system&#13;
of accounting prices is based is that potentially tradable goods are in fact&#13;
traded at the margin. In the absence of that assumption -- s.ay for example&#13;
because of fixed import quotas or heterogeneity of products -- changes in the&#13;
domestic supply of or demand for potentially tradable commodities may result&#13;
in changes in their domestic price with no effect on the trade balance. In&#13;
such circumstances accounting ratios based on the relationship between border&#13;
and domestic prices will not provide a correct estimate of marginal welfare&#13;
change and, hence, of the marginal social cost/benefit associated with the&#13;
commodity.   The cost-benefit analyst has essentially two options in dealing&#13;
with commodities for which the degree of tradability is uncertain. The first&#13;
is to treat all potentially tradable commodities as traded on the rationale&#13;
that it is likely that for minor changes in final demand imposed by the&#13;
project, quotas or other quantative interventions will be adjusted upward to&#13;
reflect the increased demand. The alternative is to treat such commodities as&#13;
non-traded goods. It is then possible to analyze their social costs of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
production in the manner described above, or in the case of commodities which&#13;
are in inelastic domestic supply to estimate the changes in producer's and&#13;
consumer's surplus which occur as a consequence of a marginal change in supply&#13;
or demand. Clearly the second alternative involves substantially more work&#13;
for the project analyst and introduces a greater margin for error. Therefore&#13;
most cost benefit studies have, wherever possible, treated tradables as fully&#13;
traded. We shall follow that approach here, but with several important&#13;
exceptions. These are primarily in the area of subsized and rationed consumer&#13;
goods, notably textiles and clothing, where the level of product quality is&#13;
substantially lower than the minimum standard in international trade. Thus&#13;
although these items fall into a category which is potentially tradable, they&#13;
are in fact non-traded goods, and we shall detail the assumptions made&#13;
concerning their social cost in the notes on specific industries below.&#13;
(b) Constant Costs vs Variable Returns to Scale&#13;
The input-output method outlined above implicitly assumes that the&#13;
separate items making up the marginal social cost of a commodity vary linearly&#13;
with the quantity of the good demanded. If this were not so, the A and P&#13;
matrices would vary with the scale of demand. This is not precisely the same&#13;
thing as assuming constancy of average costs, since the accounting prices are&#13;
applicable only to marginal changes in supply or demand. Where large changes&#13;
in the availability of an item are contemplated the project analyst must, as&#13;
always, carefully consider the possible changes in social costs associated&#13;
with non-marginal changes, and the accounting ratios presented here would not&#13;
in general be applicable. Otherwise the constancy of the A and P matrices&#13;
implies constancy of marginal social costs. Allowances for variable returns&#13;
to scale may be made by allowing variations in the a.. and p . over&#13;
ii      Si&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
different intervals of output. In practice this can be done only to a limited&#13;
extent. Moreover, given our limited knowledge of returns to scale in the&#13;
non-traded goods sectors of the Egyptian economy, any such adjustments would&#13;
be largely arbitrary, and we have therefore chosen not to make them. The&#13;
marginal social cost coefficients in our input-output structure represent the&#13;
best information we have on the cost composition of those activities.&#13;
(c) Variable Relationships Between International and Domestic Prices&#13;
Wherever domestic prices are admihistratively set, as for example is&#13;
the case with fixed producer and consumer prices, the relationship between&#13;
domestic and international prices may vary over time with changes in either&#13;
price. 1/ This has rather vexing consequences for accounting ratios based&#13;
upon the relationship between the market and shadow price of a commodity taken&#13;
at one particular moment. Although the appropriate accounting price remains&#13;
the border price, when the ratio of prices changes, the accounting ratio must&#13;
also change. In the case of agricultural commodities which exhibit&#13;
considerable year to year variations in international prices, the presence of&#13;
fixed domestic prices could imply almost continuous updating of accounting&#13;
ratios. In general, the economist estimating a set of shadow prices must use&#13;
his judgement concerning the medium term relationship beteen domestic and&#13;
foreign prices. In the Egyptian context whete there have been substantial&#13;
changes in domestic prices of price controlled traded commodities since 1979&#13;
l/ Obviously the presence of quantative restrictions is another example of a&#13;
variable relationship between world and domestic prices, since changes in&#13;
domestic demand or supply will alter the quota premium of the commodity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
we have in general focused on the relationship between these domestic prices&#13;
which, given past practice, may be expected to prevail for several years and&#13;
the "normal" world price as represented by the average of the past several&#13;
years prices. These accounting ratios should remain relatively stable over&#13;
the next few years, but major movements in either price would require revision&#13;
of the input-output value coefficients and the accounting ratios.&#13;
(d) Inelastic World Supply or Demand&#13;
Cases in which a country faces less than perfectly elastic foreign&#13;
supply or demand curves for a commodity pose a slight complication in the&#13;
estimation of accounting ratios, but can be allowed for within the general&#13;
approach by adjusting the input coefficients to reflect the marginal export&#13;
revenue or marginal import cost of the commodity. Social pricing exercises&#13;
will also require that the change in producer and consumer incomes resulting&#13;
from the price change be evaluated. For Egypt the major commodity market in&#13;
which the quantity exported could have a significant impact on the world price&#13;
is that for long staple cotton. Thus we devote some attention to working out&#13;
the plausible value of the marginal export revenue from cotton.&#13;
It should be clear from the foregoing discussion that the general&#13;
system of estimating shadow prices is quite flexible with regard to its&#13;
ability to accommodate various institutional and policy constraints which&#13;
affect the relationship between market and social prices.- The implementation&#13;
of these procedures, however, in order to calculate a basic set of shadow&#13;
prices for an economy such as Egypt, is a fairly laborious and time consuming&#13;
1/ Two levels of aggregation are represented by the "trade data approach" of&#13;
Squire and van der Tak (1975) and the input-output approach advocated by&#13;
Schohl (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
task. This is because the construction of the A and P matrices requires&#13;
detailed analyses of the markets for commodities, a project which can use&#13;
almost unlimited amounts of information. In view of the alternative methods&#13;
available for estimating more aggregated national parameters in cost-benefit&#13;
studies what are the advantages of a more detailed approach? From the point&#13;
of view of the present study we would argue that there are three important&#13;
gains from taking the greater time required for a highly detailed shadow&#13;
pricing exercise:&#13;
(i) It requires a careful examination of the workings of many commodity&#13;
markets and industries and thus generates valuable information about&#13;
the economic factors underlying the present situation. This is of&#13;
particular value in an economy like Egypt where administered pricing&#13;
decisions impinge at both the producer and consumer margins in the&#13;
markets for many commodities. Our approach allows us to trace the&#13;
impact of these interventions through a number of interconnected&#13;
markets.&#13;
(ii) Because we wish to apply our accounting prices to an examination of&#13;
comparative advantage and international competitiveness in several&#13;
Egyptian industries, quite a wide array of accounting prices is&#13;
required, and it is convenient to estimate them within the context of&#13;
a general shadow pricing exercise.&#13;
(iii) The work, once completed, can be updated relatively easily to reflect&#13;
changes in the policy environment. Once the impact of a policy&#13;
change on the coefficients of the A and P matrices has been worked&#13;
out, it is simple to trace the impact of these changes on the full&#13;
set of accounting ratios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Thus we have attempted to work with as wide a range of items as&#13;
possible within the resources available. By distinguishing between various&#13;
types of commodities - e.g. types of transport, agricultural products,&#13;
petroleum products, etc. - we are able to consider in detail the ways in which&#13;
government pricing and taxation policies are affecting the incentive structure&#13;
of the economy relative to what might be desirable in view of the structure of&#13;
social costs and benefits.&#13;
2.2 Exchange Rate Changes and Multiple Exchange Rates&#13;
Recall that we have chosen to express all values of commodities and&#13;
factors of production in terms of constant 1979 "border Egyptian Pounds" -&#13;
that is Egyptian pounds freely convertible at the average nominal exchange&#13;
rate prevailing in 1979. If one wished to switch from border pounds to&#13;
dollars as the unit of account it is simple to divide the accounting value by&#13;
the nominal exchange rate. Either unit of account provides a consistent&#13;
welfare index differing only by a scalar value.&#13;
Since 1979, however, two changes have occurred in the exchange rate&#13;
regime which must be addressed. First, there has been a marked widening in&#13;
the exchange rates offered in each of the three segments of the Egyptian&#13;
foreign exchange market - the "central bank pool", the "commercial bank pool",&#13;
and the "free" market financing own exchange imports. In 1979, transactions&#13;
in the commercial bank and central bank pools both took place at a rate of&#13;
.70 LE to the dollar, and those on the "free" market took place at rates not&#13;
exceeding .78. By 1981, although the central bank rate remained at .70, the&#13;
commercial bank rate had increased to .84 and the parallel market rate had&#13;
increased to around 1.00. Hence, the weighted average nominal exchange rate&#13;
has increased to .80. Thus, the period from 1979 to 1981 was marked by a&#13;
shift from an essentially unified to a multiple exchange rate regime and by a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
nominal depreciation of the Egyptian pound. How do these two actions affect&#13;
our estimates of accounting prices and accounting ratios?&#13;
Let us first consider the question of a nominal devaluation. The&#13;
change in the exchange rate will have no impact on the world price of tradable&#13;
commodities (denominated in terms of foreign currency) for which Egypt is a&#13;
price taker. Domestic prices will rise by the amount of the devaluation but&#13;
relative traded goods prices will be unaffected. Accounting ratios for traded&#13;
goods will also be unaffected. To see this, consider the case of a tradable&#13;
commodity which is subject to an ad valorem tariff = (l+t). The accounting&#13;
price denominated in dollars is P   and in terms of border pound is P R,&#13;
where R is the nominal average rate of exchange.   The domestic price is P R T&#13;
and the accounting ratio is therefore:&#13;
f. = P R/P RT = 1/T.                                                 (3)&#13;
The level of the nominal exchange rate is irrelevant to the shadow price of&#13;
the traded commodity and to its accounting ratio. It nevertheless remains&#13;
true that because a nominal value has changed (in this case R) we have to&#13;
deflate to constant 1979 prices if we wish to compare real resource costs in&#13;
the two periods. If our unit of account is dollars and dollar denominated&#13;
world prices are unchanged this may be accomplished simply by dividing border&#13;
pounds in each period by the nominal average exchange rate prevailing in that&#13;
period. If we wish to retain border pounds of constant purchasing power as&#13;
the unit of account then we must deflate the nominal border pounds in each&#13;
period by a discount factor equal to Dt = R79 / Rt;(t = 79,.. .N).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45 -&#13;
Either approach provides a consistent index of the real resource cost of a&#13;
traded commodity. 1/&#13;
A similar argument applies to the accounting prices and accounting&#13;
ratios applicable to non-traded goods, as long as the devaluation is nominal&#13;
and not real. A nominal devaluation implies that non-traded goods prices rise&#13;
in the same proportion as the adjustment in the exchange rate and that&#13;
therefore the relative price of traded and non-traded goods remains constant.&#13;
With constant relative prices, the structure of production is invariant to the&#13;
change in the exchange rate; hence the input-output structure on which&#13;
non-traded goods shadow prices are based remains unchanged as do the shadow&#13;
price and accounting ratio.&#13;
If the devaluation is real, in the sense that the relative prices of&#13;
tradable and non-tradable goods change after the devaluation, the effect of&#13;
the exchange rate adjustment is more complex. The relative price change will&#13;
1/ To illustrate this consider the following simple example. A project uses&#13;
100 units of an input in both 1979 and 1981 with a constant world price of&#13;
US $1.00. The commodity is subject to a tariff of 10 percent ad valorem.&#13;
The effect of the exchange rate adjustment may be seen from the following&#13;
table:&#13;
Year  Units   Pw  Accounting Value    R   Value in    Domestic  Accounting&#13;
US $               Border LE   Value        Ratio&#13;
1979   100     1         100           .70     70          77        .909&#13;
1981   100     1         100           .80     80          88        .909&#13;
It is clear from the table that the real resource cost of the input -- its&#13;
accounting value in US dollars is unchanged between the two periods, as is&#13;
the accounting ratio. In moving from domestic market values to accounting&#13;
values one would first multiply by the accounting ratio to arrive at&#13;
current border pounds. To arrive at 1979 US dollar values one would&#13;
divide by the nominal exchange rate (R). To value commodities in border&#13;
pounds of constant purchasing power one would multiply the 1981 current&#13;
border value by the discount factor 70/80 = .875. Both techniques yield&#13;
the correct answer that the real resource cost of the input is unchanged&#13;
between the two periods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
alter the input-output coefficients on which the shadow pricing system is&#13;
based and will also change the estimates of the marginal social products of&#13;
labor and capital. A real exchange rate adjustment therefore alters the&#13;
accounting ratios applicable to non-tradables and, hence, affects the overall&#13;
distribution of accounting ratios in the economy.    Predicting the net effect&#13;
of this adjustment on the accounting price system is quite difficult. 1/ In&#13;
the case of Egypt, we do not believe that the adjustment in the exchange rate&#13;
between 1979 and 1981 reflects a real exchange rate adjustment. Indeed,&#13;
increases in non-traded goods prices may have led the exchange rate,&#13;
suggesting that the nominal change from .70 to .82 reflects adjustment in the&#13;
foreign exchange market to maintain constancy of the real exchange rate.&#13;
The shift from a unified exchange rate regime to a multiple exchange&#13;
rates poses somewhat different problems. In Egypt access to various elements&#13;
of the foreign exchange market is determined by the ownership of the&#13;
enterprise as well as by the type of good. Thus, it is possible for a single&#13;
commodity to be imported at three different rates of exchange depending on the&#13;
final user or importer. The exchange rate system, therefore, operates like a&#13;
system of indirect taxes and subsidies. Enterprises with access to the&#13;
central bank pool receive an implicit subsidy on imports entering at the rate&#13;
of .70, but pay an implicit tax on exports receiving the same rate, relative&#13;
to the commercial bank and parallel market rates. A similar, although&#13;
converse argument, applies to firms importing and exporting exclusively at the&#13;
parallel rate. Differences in the exchange rates represent transfers between&#13;
1/ Very little work has been done on predicting the impact of a real exchange&#13;
rate adjustment on a system of shadow prices. See Little and Mirrlees&#13;
(1976) and Ray (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
suppliers and users of foreign exchange, rather than variations in the real&#13;
resource costs of commodities supplied to various categories of users.&#13;
If the exchange rates were specific to commodities it would be&#13;
possible to handle the implicit tax/subsidy element of the multiple exchange&#13;
rate system in a symetric fashion to that applied to trade taxes and&#13;
subsidies. One would choose one exchange rate as a base and show deviations&#13;
in the market price border price relationship due to different exchange rates&#13;
as taxes or subsidies. Because in Egypt the exchange rate may differ for&#13;
differing commodity-user pairings we have adopted a slightly different&#13;
approach. We choose as a base border Egyptian pounds convertable at a rate of&#13;
.70 in 1981. (Note that this is equivalent to constant price 1979 border&#13;
Egyptian pounds and was, therefore, chosen for convenience.) We can then&#13;
specify two "exchange rate accounting ratios", EAR's, which allow us to&#13;
convert from border LE at the commercial or parallel rate to border LE at the&#13;
central bank rate. To find the accounting value of a traded commodity whose&#13;
price is denominated in terms of domestic currency in 1981, we multiply by&#13;
both the commodity accounting ratio and the exchange rate accounting ratio to&#13;
arrive at the resource cost in terms of border pounds convertible at the&#13;
central bank rate. This value in turn may be converted into dollars at the&#13;
central bank rate if desired.&#13;
The purpose of making this adjustment is very similar to the&#13;
rationale for expressing values in terms of constant purchasing power. We&#13;
wish to reflect the ultimate impact on the trade balance of a change in&#13;
expenditure at domestic prices. Consider the commodity discussed above with&#13;
world price P , tariff rate T and accounting ratio f.      The domestic price&#13;
is variously P, = P RT &lt; P= P RcT - P.       P R f  , depending&#13;

- 48 -&#13;
on the exchange market to which the purchaser has access, where R, R    and&#13;
R are the exchange rates in the central bank, commercial bank, and free&#13;
market pools respectively. Since the world price is constant, border pound&#13;
prices must also reflect the constancy of the opportunity cost of the good.&#13;
Define the exchange rate accounting ratios EAR   = R/Rc and EAR   =&#13;
f&#13;
R/Rf. The accounting value of the commodity in border pounds (central bank&#13;
rate) may be found by:&#13;
P f  = P f EAR   = P f EAR  = P RT(1/T) = P R T(1/T)(R/Rc) =                 (4)&#13;
lj     2i          3j         w &#13;
P R Tf(l/T)(R/R ),&#13;
w&#13;
which obviously differs only by a scalar, R, from the world price P . Hence&#13;
the effective accounting ratio for any commodity-user pair consists of the&#13;
product of the commodity accounting ratio f. and the exchange rate&#13;
accounting ratio EAR (i = c,f). The exchange rate accounting ratios are&#13;
central bank rate, 1.00, commercial bank rate, .70/.84 = .833, and parallel&#13;
market rate, .70/1.00 = .70. Note that when the exchange rate accounting&#13;
ratios are applied there is no need for a further adjustment to arrive at 1979&#13;
border pound since the exchange rate is equal in both periods. 1/&#13;
2.3 Data and Assumptions&#13;
Estimation of accounting ratios by the methods described above&#13;
requires a substantial amount of information on the composition of commodity&#13;
and factor inputs used in the production and supply of goods and services. We&#13;
1/ For the project analyst whose accounts are given mainly in US dollars an&#13;
alternative approach is to convert the central bank border price values of&#13;
non-traded goods and labor given in this paper to dollar values using the&#13;
rate of .70. Either approach provides a consistent index of social value&#13;
and the choice is dictated largely by convenience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
have drawn our estimates of input-output coefficients from several statistical&#13;
sources of varying reliability.   Inevitably some of the data are not as recent&#13;
as one would desire, and given the major structural changes in the Egyptian&#13;
economy in the past several years, this represents a limitation which should&#13;
be corrected as additional information becomes available.&#13;
The cost composition breakdowns for goods and services contained in&#13;
Table 2-2 appear in Appendix 2-1. Here we shall focus on the general sources&#13;
of data employed and highlight major assumptions and methods of deriving the&#13;
input coefficients. Two major references are available on the structure of&#13;
production in Egypt. The first and most comprehensive is the 1977&#13;
input-output table. The second is the production accounts of public sector&#13;
enterprises for which the last year available is 1979. Transport and&#13;
distribution margins may be imputed from both of these sources for several&#13;
categories of traded goods, and they provide the best information available on&#13;
the cost structure of non-traded activities.   In general we have used the&#13;
public sector production accounts as our principal source supplemented by the&#13;
input-output table.&#13;
The accounting ratios estimated in this study, except in the case of&#13;
items entering into rural or urban consumption, are applicable to producer&#13;
prices. These are more appropriate for empirical studies of industrial&#13;
comparative advantage and have the additional advantage of requiring fewer&#13;
assumptions to be made regarding distribution margins.&#13;
2.3.1    The Cost Composition of Traded Goods&#13;
Cost breakdowns for more than eighty tradable goods are presented in&#13;
the Appendix tables.  These goods fall into two categories, consumer goods&#13;
used in estimating the consumption conversion ratio and producer goods which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

are significant inputs into domestic Egyptian industries. Data for the cost&#13;
analysis were drawn from published sources and from some unpublished&#13;
Government of Egypt memoranda.&#13;
Wherever possible an attempt was made to determine the cost&#13;
composition of an importable by direct comparison of cif, wholesale and retail&#13;
prices. In most instances, however, aggregation problems made direct&#13;
comparison of unit prices uncertain, and in the case of some producers goods&#13;
market prices were unavailable. Thus for approximately half of the traded&#13;
goods analyzed a border price estimate was derived from the external trade&#13;
statistics. Estimated duty rates, port handling charges, transport costs, and&#13;
distributor's margins were added to the border price to arrive at an estimate&#13;
of the final delivered costs. In other instances, principally for&#13;
non-agricultural consumer goods, it was more convenient to work backward from&#13;
the market price.&#13;
Duty rates for 1979/80 were compiled on the basis of unpublished data&#13;
provided by the Department of Customs and Excise. The compilations included&#13;
estimates of both statutory rates and actual collections. Where substantial&#13;
differences existed between the two figures, the ad valorem equivalent of the&#13;
actual collections was used as the relevant rate. If several duty rates were&#13;
applicable to items within a single category of tradable goods -- e.g.,&#13;
industrial chemicals -- a weighted average duty was estimated for the category&#13;
using the 1979 levels of imports.&#13;
Information on excise and other indirect taxes and on price&#13;
differentials charged by public sector distribution agencies were taken from&#13;
the public sector accounts and several additional unpublished sources. 1/&#13;

For traded agricultural commodities transport and distribution margins and the&#13;
implicit subsidy for urban consumer goods were taken from two recent&#13;
agricultural price policy studies carried out by the Bank. 1/&#13;
Port handling costs were estimated from per ton handling charges at&#13;
Alexandria Harbour. Where these data did not exist we attempted to impute&#13;
"typical!' handling margins from comparable categories of goods.&#13;
Road and rail transport costs were available from data provided in&#13;
the Egypt National Transport Study (Netherlands Engineering Consultants&#13;
(1981)). The various volumes of this report provided estimates of ton/mile&#13;
charges for major commodity groups by both rail and lorry.&#13;
Perhaps the weakest link in our analysis of the cost composition of&#13;
tradables is in the distribution margins imputed on the basis of data from the&#13;
input-output table and the public sector accounts. In the absence of a survey&#13;
of distributive trades, these represent the best information available; but&#13;
the estimates could be considerably improved. Average retail and wholesale&#13;
margins derived from these sources were 19.0 and 16.8 percent respectively&#13;
which seem a bit high by comparison with other countries, especially with&#13;
respect to Egypt's relatively compact spacial distribution. We have&#13;
nevertheless employed these margins in the absence of alternative information.&#13;
There were several tradable activities which required special&#13;
consideration. Notes on these specific industries are found in Appendix 2-1.&#13;

2.2.2    Non-Traded Goods and Services&#13;
Cost breakdowns for forty non-traded goods and services are presented&#13;
in the Appendix tables. These are the major activities which are either&#13;
(i) important inputs into industrial production or (ii) major components of&#13;
rural and urban consumption. The principal sources of information on the&#13;
non-traded sector were the 1977 input-output table and the public sector&#13;
production accounts. These were supplemented by sector studies in&#13;
transportation and limited personal interviews. Although none of the sources&#13;
offered exhaustive information on all activities the estimates derived from&#13;
them should prove sufficiently accurate for the estimation of accounting&#13;
prices. In the remainder of this chapter we deal generally with the problems&#13;
encountered in estimating the input-output coefficients for non-traded&#13;
industries and direct specific remarks to industries where the estimates are&#13;
unusual or uncertain.&#13;
The cost coefficients for most non-traded activities are based on the&#13;
long run average cost of production. It was assumed that the industries&#13;
operated under conditions of constant marginal costs over the range of output&#13;
involved in the estimates. Hence, average Leontief type production&#13;
coefficients are appropriate for the evaluation of marginal social costs of&#13;
production. 1/ An exception to this general rule was made in the case of&#13;
railway transportation, for which evidence indicated that economies of scale&#13;
were significant, and that 1979-80 market prices differed from marginal costs.&#13;
1/ An alternative approach would have been to assume a plausible value for&#13;
the divergence between marginal and average costs for industries in which&#13;
economies of scale were believed to be significant. Data on potential&#13;
economies of scale in Egyptian industries are unavailable, however.&#13;
Rather than use estimates derived from data on other countries it was felt&#13;
appropriate to assume generally constant costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
By assuming all costs to be variable, possible benefits from&#13;
increased utilization of industrial capacity resulting from project induced&#13;
increases in demand are ignored. Excess capacity in Egypt occurred most&#13;
frequently in those import substitution industries which are treated here as&#13;
tradable goods. Non-tradable activities which provide direct inputs into the&#13;
manufacturing sector are generally services, and output may reasonably be&#13;
assumed to keep pace with increases in demand. Thus, as a rule, the use of&#13;
long run average costs should provide accurate estimates of the marginal&#13;
social cost of non-traded goods. An exception to the general procedure was&#13;
made in the case of certain quota restricted inputs into Egyptian&#13;
manufacturing. The assumptions made regarding the marginal social cost of&#13;
these industries are dealt with in the notes on specific activities.&#13;
The Allocation of Wages and Salaries&#13;
The distribution of labor costs between payments to skilled labor and&#13;
payments to unskilled labor has important implications for the final estimates&#13;
of resource costs, since the opportunity costs of skilled and unskilled&#13;
workers differ significantly. The division between skilled and unskilled&#13;
labor is in fact a division between labor which is assumed to be fully&#13;
employed in the economy and labor which is either unemployed or&#13;
underemployed. Skilled labor is labor which is assumed to be engaged in&#13;
occupations where the market wage represents the private opportunity cost of&#13;
the worker. The distinction between skilled and unskilled workers requires&#13;
that the latter category include all workers whose jobs require limited or no&#13;
on-the-job training. Such "semi-skilled" occupations as machine paced&#13;
operatives or drivers ought to be counted as unskilled labor, since these&#13;
occupations can be readily filled with limited training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
The nature of the data provided on non-traded activities made a high&#13;
degree of approximation and some arbitrary classifications necessary in making&#13;
the allocation of labor costs. For approximately half of the non-traded&#13;
activities examined an estimated breakdown between payments to skilled and&#13;
unskilled labor was available. 1/ For the remaining activities the principle&#13;
sources of data on wage payments were the Public Sector Enterprise Accounts&#13;
and the ILO (1981) labor force study. The public sector accounts provided&#13;
information on the distribution of wages and salaries between production and&#13;
other (technical, managerial, and clerical) workers. In cases where this was&#13;
the only information available, all production workers were allotted to the&#13;
unskilled category while other employees were considered skilled. Where&#13;
possible, data from the public enterprise accounts were supplemented by&#13;
reference to the ILO report. All unskilled labor in industrial non-tradable&#13;
activities was assumed to be urban unskilled labor. Although this assumption&#13;
is not strictly correct for such activities as road transportation and&#13;
distributive trades where rural enterprises are important components of the&#13;
industry, it was impossible to estimate the relevant proportions of rural and&#13;
urban workers in these activities.&#13;
The Treatment of Indirect Capital Inputs&#13;
To estimate the indirect inputs of capital into a project it is&#13;
necessary to know something about the size and composition of the capital&#13;
stocks of industries supplying inputs into the project under evaluation. It&#13;
is also necessary to convert capital inputs whose economic lives extend over&#13;
more than a single period into current inputs without distorting the resulting&#13;
estimates of accounting prices.&#13;
1/ These were industries covered by the author's personal interviews or by&#13;
other firm level returns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
The approach adopted in this study was to identify three primary&#13;
input categories of capital -- buildings, machinery, and vehicles. Estimates&#13;
of the annual inputs of capital services provided by each of these three&#13;
categories of assets were computed for each non-traded activity. The&#13;
procedure for estimating the annual input of capital services at market prices&#13;
was quite simple. An annuity factor based on the marginal product of capital&#13;
and an assumed economic life of the capital input was applied to the estimated&#13;
value of the capital stock of the asset. This annuity gave the annual&#13;
equivalent of the depreciation and return to capital at market prices, and was&#13;
entered as a direct primary factor cost of the activity employing the capital&#13;
input. In this manner, cost coefficients for capital inputs were derived for&#13;
each non-traded activity. As our best estimate of the marginal productivity&#13;
of capital at market prices we employ 10 percent (net of tax). Ideally, it&#13;
would have been desirable to estimate the annual input of working capital for&#13;
firms in addition to the input of fixed capital. Unfortunately, information&#13;
on the level of working capital existed only for distributive trades; thus&#13;
working capital was excluded from all cost estimates except those for&#13;
wholesaling and retailing.&#13;
Information existed on the size and composition of the capital stock&#13;
for 15 of the 40 non-traded activities analyzed. The estimated values,&#13;
however, referred to years ranging from 1976 through 1980. To deal with these&#13;
estimates in the simplest manner possible it was assumed that the percentage&#13;
composition of capital costs in total costs in the reference year was the same&#13;
as in 1979-80. For the remaining industries the only information on capital&#13;
costs was an estimate of value added minus wages and salaries. This figure&#13;
presumably includes interest, depreciation, profits, and direct taxes. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
order to provide an approximate distribution of capital costs among the three&#13;
categories of domestic capital inputs an estimated breakdown of aggregate&#13;
figures was made on the basis of the average composition of assets for firms&#13;
in Egypt. The average composition of assets for firms was determined from&#13;
information on the composition of investment contained in the 1978 plan (World&#13;
Bank (1981b)). The percentage of each asset category in the total was&#13;
multiplied by its annuity factor to provide an estimate of the percentage&#13;
composition of capital costs in gross profits.&#13;
Miscellaneous-Costs and Extra Capitalists' Incomes&#13;
These two input categories are elements in the cost structure of a&#13;
limited number of non-traded activities. If extra incomes accrue to owners of&#13;
activities supplying inputs into a project under analysis, these extra incomes&#13;
should be counted as indirect costs of employing the non-traded good. While&#13;
it is not difficult to estimate the value of direct extra capitalists' incomes&#13;
resulting from:.an investment, the limited data available on supplying&#13;
industries made the estimation of extra capitalists' incomes in non-traded&#13;
activities supply inputs very uncertain. In general, therefore, it was&#13;
assumed that extra incomes did not accrue to the private owners of non-traded&#13;
activities. Any discrepancy between the estimated long run average costs of&#13;
production (including a normal return to capital) and the value of output was&#13;
assumed to consist of miscellaneous costs which were not included in the&#13;
initial cost estimate. The implication of the procedure adopted is that the&#13;
net of tax return available to investors in Egypt is close to a real rate of&#13;
10 percent. We shall argue in Chapter 3 that this assumption is quite&#13;
reasonable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
There were several industries in which our estimates were&#13;
particularly uncertain or in which special assumptions which departed from the&#13;
general scheme outlined above were required. These activities are discussed&#13;
in Appendix 2-1.&#13;
2.4 Household Income and Expenditure: Conversion Factors for Consumption and&#13;
Savings&#13;
Consumption Conversion Factors&#13;
Before we can proceed to estimate the accounting prices of factors of&#13;
production it is necessary to construct accounting ratios for marginal&#13;
increases in consumption by various income categories. These consumption&#13;
conversion factors will be used in Chapters 3 and 4 when we attempt to&#13;
estimate the cost in terms of the unit of account of policies which increase&#13;
the level of consumption by various households at market prices. Since&#13;
consumer expenditure represents an important commitment of resources, we&#13;
devote considerable attention to establishing the value of a unit increase in&#13;
consumption at accounting prices. The value of a unit increase in consumption&#13;
at market prices in terms of the numeraire depends upon the commodity&#13;
composition of marginal consumer expenditure. Only one reasonably reliable&#13;
source of data on consumer expenditure exists for rural and urban households&#13;
in Egypt, the Household Expenditure Survey 1974-75. The expenditure survey&#13;
covers 3000 households in rural and urban areas and represents the only&#13;
comprehensive source of expenditure data by income class for Egypt in the&#13;
1970's.&#13;
In principle, our estimates should apply to marginal increases in&#13;
consumption and therefore require the use of marginal expenditure weights.&#13;
Lacking estimates of expenditure elasticities, we have been compelled to work&#13;
with the average weights from the expenditure survey. This introduces one&#13;
important potential source of bias on our estimates of consumption conversion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
ratios. Incomes have grown rapidly in Egypt since 1975, and it is reasonable&#13;
to expect that, particularly in urban areas, the expenditure weights for&#13;
agricultural commodities and subsidized basic consumer goods may have declined&#13;
somewhat from the 1974/75 levels. Because of the high accounting ratios&#13;
applicable to subsidized urban consumer goods, this may cause our estimates of&#13;
consumption conversion ratios to overstate the accounting cost of average&#13;
urban consumption somewhat.&#13;
The categories for which consumption conversion ratios were&#13;
calculated cover average rural and urban consumption plus high and low income&#13;
conversion ratios for urban consumers. The lower limit for high income&#13;
households was taken as LE 1000 per annum in 1974/75, which roughly defines&#13;
the upper decile of all urban households by income. The upper limit for low&#13;
income households was taken as LE 200 per annum which defines roughly the&#13;
bottom three deciles of the urban household distribution. In our general&#13;
analysis we shall use the conversion ratios applicable to average&#13;
consumption. It is useful, however, both for the appraisal of specific&#13;
projects and policies and for the insights which can be gained into the&#13;
existing tax and subsidy structure to supplement these with the conversion&#13;
factors for specific groups of households.&#13;
The expenditure distributions and the resulting estimates of&#13;
conversion ratios are presented in Tables 2-3 and 2-4. The most striking&#13;
results are the differences between rural and urban conversion ratios and the&#13;
magnitude of the conversion ratio for average urban consumption. For each LE&#13;
100 increase in average urban consumption the commitment of foreign exchange&#13;
convertable at the official rate is LE 111. An increase in average rural&#13;
consumption on the other hand commits the economy to only LE 107 for each LE&#13;
100 in expenditure at market prices. The effects of the current policy of&#13;
heavily subsidizing urban consumption are readily apparent in these numbers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Evaluating Household Savings&#13;
The conversion factor for savings of wage recipients will depend on&#13;
the form in which increases in wealth are held. Because little evidence&#13;
exists on the asset choice of households in Egypt, a simple model for&#13;
determining the social cost of several forms of assets is developed, and&#13;
plausible values for the parameters are used to provide an approximate.&#13;
estimate of the accounting ratio for savings. 1/&#13;
If the savings of an average worker's household increase by one LE&#13;
(i.e., if household income increases by the reciprocal of the marginal&#13;
propensity to save), the household is assumed to hold its increased wealth in&#13;
one of three forms, as an increase in the level of cash balances, as a deposit&#13;
in the banking system, or as an investment in housing, agriculture or casual&#13;
sector activities (e.g. small scale enterprise or petty trading). 2/&#13;
1/ The 1974/75 expenditure survey contains no information on household&#13;
savings behavior or on the asset composition of households.&#13;
2/ This simplified description of asset choice may not be altogether&#13;
incorrect for Egyptian workers' households. Land is not among assets&#13;
acquired by workers. Direct investment in industrial enterprises is also&#13;
not a feasible alternative for most workers. Deposits in the banking&#13;
system, especially in the government-owned savings and commercial banks,&#13;
are a form in which workers' households choose to hold their savings, and&#13;
anecdotal evidence suggests there is substantial investment in agriculture&#13;
by urban workers and by migrant laborers via remittances. Casual sector&#13;
activities remain an important source of employment (although perhaps not&#13;
of income) for other members of fully employed workers' households, and it&#13;
seems worthwhile to include the alternative despite the absence of data.&#13;

The average saver is assumed to be infinitely lived and does not dissave.&#13;
Thus, his additional savings represent a permanent increase in the stock of&#13;
wealth and are not drawn down at a later point in life-cycle of the household&#13;
to finance consumption. 1/ The social cost of each type of asset is&#13;
separately estimated, and the social cost of savings in general may then be&#13;
found by weighting the social cost of each asset by its proportion of the&#13;
typical savers portfolio.&#13;
The social cost of an increase in cash holdings is most easily&#13;
estimated. Given the assumptions, the increase in cash balances held by the&#13;
household is permanent. Because the saver is not expected to draw down these&#13;
cash holdings at any future date to finance further consumption or the&#13;
purchase of alternative forms of assets, the social cost is zero.&#13;
Assets held in the form of investments in the banking system in&#13;
agriculture or in the casual sector represent an addition to the stock of&#13;
capital. If the unit of savings is invested in capital goods with a market&#13;
1/ The assumption of an infinitely lived saver, although not essential for&#13;
the analysis, greatly simplifies the algebra. It is consistent with a&#13;
life-cycle savings hypothesis in which the amount of household income&#13;
allocated to consumption over the life cycle of each cohort is equal to&#13;
the resources accruing to the household over its lifetime. In such a&#13;
model, households in each cohort first save and then dissave to maintain a&#13;
preferred level of consumption. It has been shown that in the presence of&#13;
steady population growth and/or growth of income, the saving and&#13;
wealth-income ratio will remain constant for all cohorts taken together.&#13;
Thus, the infinitely lived saver represents the average over all cohorts&#13;
in the population, and if the conditions of steady growth of population or&#13;
income are approximately fulfilled, he will not dissave and his savings&#13;
and wealth-income ratios will remain constant, as hypothesized. See&#13;

and the Supply of Capital", Social Research, 33, No.2, pp. 160-217.&#13;

value of K , the accounting cost of the unit of investment is equal to&#13;
fkK , where fk is the accounting ratio applicable to capital goods of&#13;
the type purchased. The investment generates an annual stream of income at&#13;
accounting prices determined by the social rate of return on the investment&#13;
activity. If the investment is in the public sector, as for example, when the&#13;
increase in savings is held in the banking system, the social return is&#13;
assumed equal to the accounting rate of interest. 1/ Hence, the annual social&#13;
income from the investment in period t is RfkKt at accounting prices when&#13;
R is the accounting rate of interest. If the assets are privately held they&#13;
are assumed to earn a real rate of return of r per cent per annum at market&#13;
prices. The annual stream of social income produced by the private casual&#13;
sector investment may be found by multiplying the annual returns at market&#13;
prices by an accounting factor for gross profits, fp. The accounting ratio&#13;
for gross profits is the ratio of value added at world prices less wages&#13;
evaluated at the shadow wage rate to value added less wages at market prices.&#13;
The act of saving and investment by the household entitles it to an&#13;
annual income equal to the return on the asset at market prices. Deposits&#13;
held in the banking system are assumed to earn a real rate of return of i per&#13;
cent per annum; the annual income from the investment is, therefore, iKt.&#13;
Investments in casual sector activities earn an annual return of rKt. The&#13;
household is assumed to consume a portion of the increase in income and to&#13;
1/ This is clearly true for government-owned banks which hold the bulk of&#13;
workers' savings. Privately-owned banks may also be assumed to lend to&#13;
the government from marginal increase in funds.&#13;

save the remainder in the same ratio for other forms of income. 1/ Thus, in&#13;
any year the distribution of consumption and savings out of interest income&#13;
from the initial unit of savings is given by:&#13;
iK t(c + s)              c + s = 1                                     (3)&#13;
Savings out of interest income are assumed to be reinvested in the banking&#13;
system. If the rates of interest and the marginal propensity to save are&#13;
assumed constant over time, wealth and government investment out of the&#13;
initial unit of savings grow at a rate:&#13;
K  = K (I + si)t                                                       (4)&#13;
t    0&#13;
The social cost of the consumption and investment out of interest in any year&#13;
is given by:&#13;
ct = iK t(cfc+ sf k.                                                   (5)&#13;
where fc is the conversion ratio applicable to the consumption of the&#13;
household. If savings are invested in agriculture or casual sector activities&#13;
consumption and savings out of the return to the investment may be found in a&#13;
similar manner. Adding the simplifying assumption that all savings are plowed&#13;
back into the same activity, the social cost of consumption and investment in&#13;
year t arising out of the return to the initial investment is given by:&#13;
Ct = rK t(f cc + f ks)                                                 (6)&#13;
The social cost of unit of savings held as bank deposits in year 0 is&#13;
given by the accounting cost of the investment in year zero less the present&#13;
discounted value of the returns to the investment plus the present value of&#13;
1/ Direct taxes are ignored because the savers whose accounting ratio we are&#13;
trying to estimate escape the direct tax net. Because the accounting&#13;
ratio for taxes is zero, it would be possible to include tax payments in&#13;
the derivation of the accounting ratio for savings of workers without&#13;
difficulty.&#13;

Setting Ko = 1 and substituting from above, the accounting ratio for savings&#13;
held on bank deposits may be expressed as:&#13;
fd   fk    (Rf- cif    - sif )/(R - si)                                (9)&#13;

Empirical values for savings held as bank deposits and in casual&#13;
sector investments are presented in Table 2-5. In column 1 a unit of savings&#13;
is assumed to be held as deposits in the banking system. Sources of the&#13;
estimated parameter values are given in the notes accompanying the table. The&#13;
accounting ratio for bank deposits is quite robust with reference to&#13;
reasonable changes in the parameter values. Stipulating that all interest&#13;
income is consumed raises the accounting ratio only slightly to .160.&#13;
Allowing the accounting rate of interest to increase to 10 percent results in&#13;
a fall in the accounting ratio to .102.&#13;
Estimated parameter values for only three casual sector activities&#13;
are applied to the model. The activities considered are petty trading,&#13;
housing and small scale enterprise which are probably the most important uses&#13;
of investible funds in the casual sector.&#13;

for the average composition of capital stock. The real rate of&#13;
return on bank deposits is assumed to be 1.0 percent. Deposit&#13;
rates vary from 9-15 percent in nominal terms. With expected&#13;
inflation between 12 and 15 percent real rates of interest may&#13;
range from -6 to 3.0 percent. Real rates of return to casual&#13;

The set of parameter values in Column 2 refers to savings which are&#13;
held as a permanent increase in the capital stocks of the casual sector. The&#13;
accounting ratio, fk5 is a simple average of consumption items frequently&#13;
manufactured and sold by the casual sector in Egypt.     In estimating fp it&#13;
was assumed that implicit "wage costs" of the self-employed trader represented&#13;
75 percent of value added in petty trading and that market traders purchase no&#13;
inputs other than items in their inventory. Thus the accounting ratio for&#13;
output and purchased inputs was .96, the accounting ratio for labor inputs was&#13;
taken as .77, and fp was estimated at .90.&#13;
The most difficult of.the parameters to estimate was the rate of&#13;
return to petty trading activities. No careful study of the casual sector has&#13;
yet been undertaken. The limited evidence available indicates that rates of&#13;
return to small scale manufacturing and petty trading may be quite low.&#13;
Incomes of petty traders are among the lowest of all occupational groups and&#13;
frequently small scale manufacturing is undertaken by workers queueing or&#13;
formal sector or migrant labor employment. In Table 2-5 it was assumed that&#13;
the marginal rate of return to investments in the casual sector was 5.0&#13;
percent per annum. Because this was only a guess, alternate rates of return&#13;
of 2.0 percent and 8.0 percent were also tried, with corresponding accounting&#13;
ratios of 1.08 and 1.26 respectively. If the assumption that savings are&#13;
ploughed back into the activity is abandoned and replaced by an assumption&#13;
that all profits are consumed by the household, the accounting ratio rises to&#13;
1.20. Not surprisingly, the accounting ratio for assets held in this form&#13;
substantially exceeds the accounting ratio for deposits held in the banking&#13;
system. Because the rate of return in casual sector activities is assumed to&#13;
be much lower than the accounting rate of interest, the social cost of the&#13;
investment and the increase in consumption made possible by the investment are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
not offset by the additions to uncommitted social income which would arise&#13;
from an investment in the public sector. If the parameters presented in Table&#13;
2.5 are approximately correct, it appears that the government of Egypt could&#13;
increase the social return to savings of workers by increasing the incentives&#13;
to hold assets as deposits in the banking system rather than as investments in&#13;
casual sector activities.&#13;
Column 3 refers to the case in which the unit of savings is invested&#13;
in agriculture. For simplicity the agricultural investment is assumed to take&#13;
the form of an increase in working capital which will be spent on additional&#13;
implements or seeds.   An approximate accounting ratio, fk' is given by an&#13;
average of the accounting ratios for agricultural products and hardware. The&#13;
value of fp and the rate of return are estimated from Cuddihy (1980) and&#13;
World Bank (1981).&#13;
The investment is assumed to be in marginal food crop agricultural&#13;
activities, either on urban plots by the worker and his household or by&#13;
relatives in the rural sector to whom the worker remits a portion of his&#13;
income.  The accounting ratio fp is set equal to 1.71.    Again the rate of&#13;
return is the most difficult parameter to estimate. Internal rates of return&#13;
for food crops range from below zero to more than 50 percent. Since the&#13;
agricultural investment in question is assumed to be marginal, it is likely&#13;
that the return will be at the lower end of this very broad range. As a&#13;
tentative estimate r is set equal to .10. The estimate is highly uncertain&#13;
and, therefore, alternative values of .05 and .15 were also tried. Estimates&#13;
of the accounting ratio for savings invested in agriculture ranged from .677&#13;
to -.073, with a preferred value of .107.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
The final asset choice considered is investment in housing&#13;
construction. Studies of urbanization in Egypt indicate that construction of&#13;
a house either in the city or in their native villages is an important use of&#13;
savings of urban residents. For investments of this type data are again quite&#13;
limited. The cost breakdowns for housing construction permitted an estimate&#13;
of fk and fp.   The rate of return to housing construction was placed at&#13;
12 percent in the absence of evidence on actual returns. Because much of the&#13;
investment in housing occurs in response to the desire to establish a home in&#13;
a rural village, it does not seem unreasonable to believe that the rates of&#13;
return on such investments may be lower than the very high rates of return to&#13;
urban housing.   Given the assumptions, the cost qf a unit of savings held in&#13;
the form of an investment in housing is equal to 1.88.&#13;
The aggregate accounting ratio for savings of workers is made up of&#13;
the weighted average of the accounting ratios for each of the asset choices&#13;
considered. Again lack of data severely limits the accuracy of the estimated&#13;
accounting ratio. The distribution of savings among assets held has not been&#13;
analyzed for any class of Egyptian households. For this reason alternative&#13;
accounting ratios are worked out in Table 2-6 on the basis of several&#13;
plausible assumptions concerning the composition of savings. The range of&#13;
results -- from 1.02 to .43 -- indicates that the accounting ratio for savings&#13;
is quite sensitive to assumptions regarding portfolio composition. In the&#13;
absence of better information the accounting ratio for savings is set equal to&#13;
.60, which is near the lower end of the range, reflecting an assumption that&#13;
about 30 percent of the portfolio is held in the form of cash balances and&#13;
deposits.&#13;

2.5 Conversion Ratios for Other Expenditure Categories&#13;
In this section we present estimates of summary parameters which may&#13;
be useful in providing rough estimates of the shadow cost of several&#13;
categories of expenditure. We shall calculate the standard conversion factor&#13;
and conversion factors for intermediate and capital goods.&#13;
(a) The Standard Conversion Factor&#13;
The standard conversion factor is useful in converting the market&#13;
value of minor non-traded items into their equivalent value at border prices,&#13;
and it may be used to express the results of changes in consumer and producer&#13;
surplus in terms of the numeraire. It also provides a summary measure of the&#13;
relationship in the economy between shadow prices and market prices and, under&#13;
certain simplifying assumptions, can be thought of as the ratio of the market&#13;
exchange rate to the shadow exchange rate. 1/ Given the large number of goods&#13;
for which we have estimated accounting ratios, the best estimate of the&#13;
standard conversion factor is provided by the median of the frequency&#13;
distribution of an appropriately selected set of tradable and non-tradable&#13;
commodities.  The median of the full distribution of 130 commodities is .993.&#13;
This may slightly overstate the standard conversion factor because we have&#13;
included a large number of petroleum products in our sample, and, hence, the&#13;
full sample may overrepresent commodities which are highly subsidized. An&#13;
alternative estimate is provided by taking the median of the sets of tradable&#13;
inputs (T1-38), urban consumption goods (Ul-28) and non-tradables (Nl-36).&#13;
The estimate of the SCF is .960, which is very similar to our first estimate.&#13;
1/ On this point see Scott (1974) or Little and Mirrless (1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
We therefore take as our best estimate of the standard conversion factor a&#13;
value of .965, which is also the median of the distribution of the 75 major&#13;
tradable and non-tradable commodities in our sample.&#13;
(b) A Conversion Factor for Investment&#13;
The conversion factor for investment is useful in cases where the&#13;
only estimate of the capital cost of an inp'pt consists of a single value&#13;
figure for total investment or of the'residual of value added minus wages. In&#13;
such circumstances,,the social cost of the capital input may be estimated by&#13;
combining information on the average distribution of investment by type (eg.&#13;
buildings, machinery etc.) and the accounting ratios for investment goods. We&#13;
present two conversion factors for capital inputs. The first is applicable to&#13;
total investment expressed in LE. The second is the accounting ratio for&#13;
rental of capital and is applicable to annualized capital cost data such as&#13;
value added minus wages. It is found by taking the annual amortization of the&#13;
capital stock by type at' the Accounting Rate of Interest as weights and&#13;
applying the relevant conversion ratios. Results of the estimates are set out&#13;
in Table 2-7. Because the accounting ratio for building and construction&#13;
exceeds unity by a large margin the accounting ratios for investment are also&#13;
generally above one.&#13;
(c)  A Conversion Factor for Intermediate Goods&#13;
We present a summary measure of the accounting ratio for intermediate&#13;
goods for reasons similar to those applicable to the conversion factor for&#13;
investment. In some circumstances, miscellaneous intermediates may be lumped&#13;
together as a cost item and may, therefore, require a general conversion&#13;
factor. This accounting ratio should not be used in circumstances when&#13;
individual cost items are specified. We take as our estimate of the&#13;
accounting ratio for intermediates the median of the distribution of tradables&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
(Tl-38), agricultural inputs and outputs (Al-13) and non-tradables (Nl-36)&#13;
which is .980. Clearly we would not go far wrong in using the standard&#13;
conversion factor to value miscellaneous intermediate inputs.&#13;

Appendix 2-1: Cost Coefficients for Commodities in Egypt&#13;
The cost breakdowns for 130 commodities in Egypt are presented in&#13;
this appendix. These cost breakdowns are the precentage of the delivered cost&#13;
of a commodity at market prices made up of other commodity inputs and primary&#13;
inputs. The list of commodities and primary inputs is in Table A2-1-1. Cost&#13;
coefficients are presented in Table A2-1-2. To find the cost breakdown of any&#13;
commodity, find its identification number in Table A2-2-1. For example, the&#13;
identification number for textile machinery is 18. Commodity cost&#13;
coefficients are then given by the second entries corresponding to that&#13;
identification number. Thus, 18, 117 gives the port charges coefficient for&#13;
textile machinery. Primary input cost coefficients are also available in the&#13;
P matrix.   To find these values, locate the column corresponding to the item&#13;
identification number.    Primary input cost contents are given by the row&#13;
values 1-11. The total direct primary input cost is given by row 12.&#13;
Total (direct plus indirect) cost coefficients are available in Table&#13;
A2-1-3, the P matrix. In this case the matrix is transposed. Commodities are&#13;
listed as rows; primary input coefficients are listed as columns. To find the&#13;

Notes on Specific Industries&#13;
(a) Subsidized Producer Goods&#13;
A number of producer goods including cement, building materials,&#13;
steel reinforcing rods, and certain industrial chemicals are both produced in&#13;
Egypt and imported. These commodities are distributed through public sector&#13;
&#13;

authorities and are sold at subsidized prices. In certain cases, however,&#13;
there is a price differential charged between imported and domestic sources of&#13;
supply and the domestic production is sold at a rationed price below that of&#13;
the competing import. The nature of the market for these commodities is&#13;
illustrated in Figure A2-1. The domestic demand curve is represented by DD.&#13;
Domestic supply is given by SS which is displaced downward by production&#13;
subsidies to S'S'. Production is given by OA which is sold at a price of&#13;
PD. If the public sector marketing authority fills remaining domestic&#13;
demand at PD by imports AB, a per unit subsidy of PWPD is implied and&#13;
the appropriate accounting ratio is Pw /P . If on the other hand the&#13;
supply authority allows the domestic price on the imported commodity to rise&#13;
to PW (while rationing the domestically produced quantity) import demand&#13;
declines to AB'; and the appropriate accounting ratio is 1.0. Note that in&#13;
both cases the appropriate accounting price is the world price, but that the&#13;
ratio of the accounting price to the domestic price changes in response to the&#13;
behavior of the marketing authorities. The presence of a production subsidy&#13;
is irrelevant to the determination of the accounting price since in both cases&#13;
the incremental change in demand is met by changes in the volume of imports.&#13;
We have in general estimated two sets of accounting ratios for these products:&#13;
one based on the assumption that the supply authority charges a uniform price&#13;
for the commodity and the other based on the assumption that the subsidized&#13;
domestic price is charged only to limited categories of users with the&#13;
consequence that market prices for the non-rationed segment of the market have&#13;
as their basis the import price of the commodity. In general we shall use the&#13;
latter accounting ratio except in the case of cement in which the former set&#13;
of assumptions applies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
(b) Cement&#13;
Cement has shifted from an exportable to an importable in recent&#13;
years, and Egypt has embarked on a major investment campaign which should&#13;
permit local production to fill domestic demand within ten years. In this&#13;
study cement has been treated as an importable with a CIF price based on the&#13;
normal level of interntional prices, since in recent years there have been&#13;
substantial year to year variations in the international price. As we noted&#13;
above, cement is sold at a control price below the import parity price by the&#13;
Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction, thus its accounting ratio exceeds 1.0.&#13;
(c) Fertilizer&#13;
Fertilizer is a second industrial sector in which it is possible that&#13;
a reversal of trade flows may take place in the medium term. Although at&#13;
present Egypt is a net importer of fertilizer, there are sufficient planned&#13;
investments in capacity expansion to achieve self-sufficiency, and possibly to&#13;
generate an exportable surplus. Experience suggests that the investment&#13;
program may slip somewhat. Hence fertilizers are treated in this report as&#13;
importables, but major increases in domestic supply could call for a revision&#13;
of the direction of trade assumption.&#13;
(d) Textiles and Clothing&#13;
Product heterogeneity represents the principal impediment to accurate&#13;
shadow pricing in the textile sector. Egypt is a major exporter of cotton&#13;
textiles which are its principal manufactured export. There are however some&#13;
segments of the textile industry which produce wholly non-traded varieties of&#13;
cloth, and the high incidence of trade in textiles with bilateral payments&#13;
trading partners makes it difficult to establish the appropriate international&#13;
price for much of the sector's traded output. We have,adopted the following&#13;
simplified approach to the textiles sector. Rationed cloth which is of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 7 -&#13;
standard below that entering international trade has been treated as a&#13;
non-tradable. Cotton yarn and non-rationed cloth are treated as exportable&#13;
with a "normal" international price based on their unit values in trade with&#13;
the industrialized countries. Unit prices for trade with the eastern bloc are&#13;
not employed.&#13;
Clothing is a mixed sector as well. There are limited exports of&#13;
clothing, again largely to the non-OECD countries, which coexist with limited&#13;
imports of clothing for the urban high-income consumer. The bulk of output,&#13;
though, is the nontraded product of small scale enterprises. We have&#13;
considered two categories of clothing, importable and non-traded.&#13;
It is important to recall that although these accounting ratios are&#13;
sufficient to establish the accounting costs of rural and urban consumption&#13;
and to provide some rough indication of the relative social returns to textile&#13;
production, appraisal of textile projects would require substantially more&#13;
detailed analysis of the proposed output of the project. The aggregate&#13;
accounting ratios for the textiles sector should be used with caution.&#13;
(e) Subsidized Agricultural Products&#13;
As we noted in section 2.1 above, the major problem with subsidized&#13;
agricultural products is that the relationship between domestic prices and&#13;
international prices may fluctuate greatly over time. The accounting ratios&#13;
which we have employed are based on mean international prices for the period&#13;
1977-80 and on the 1980 levels of producer and consumer prices. These&#13;
relative values should remain roughly constant in the short to medium term,&#13;
but any major change in either the international price or the administered&#13;
domestic price will require a revision of the accounting ratio. We have&#13;
provided three sets of accounting ratios for agricultural commodities - one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
each for rural and urban consumption and one for farm output - based on the&#13;
relationship of the domestic price to the international price.&#13;
(f) Cotton&#13;
Cotton is the only commodity in which Egypt faces a less than&#13;
perfectly elastic demand curve for its exports. The appropriate accounting&#13;
ratio is therefore based on the marginal export revenue rather than the&#13;
average FOB price. In Appendix 2-2 we derive an accounting ratio for cotton&#13;
and explore the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative estimates of the&#13;
elasticity of demand for long staple cotton.&#13;
(g) Petroleum Products&#13;
Petroleum is the largest single Egyptian export by value, and&#13;
domestically produced petroleum products play a major role in determining the&#13;
social cost of such important non-traded activities as transport and&#13;
electrical generation. The significance of these products in our analysis is&#13;
greatly increased by the fact that all of them sell at domestic prices which&#13;
are far below the export parity price. The presence of major implicit&#13;
subsidies in the market for domestic petroleum products raises no major&#13;
problems with the method of analysis, beyond our previously mentioned caveat&#13;
regarding potential variability in the relationship between domestic and&#13;
international prices, though it raises extremely important policy issues. For&#13;
each product the implicit subsidy to consumption may be estimated by working&#13;
back from the domestic price imputing transport and distribution margins and&#13;
thereby arriving at the ex-factory value. This may then be compared with the&#13;
border price. Our estimates of implicit subsidies and accounting ratios are&#13;
taken from the Petroleum Products Pricing Study (Pierce, Whitman (1981)) and&#13;
refer to the period 1979/80. Major changes either in domestic or&#13;
international prices would have to be reflected in revised accounting ratios&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
for the products concerned. The magnitude of the price differential is quite&#13;
stunning. Accounting ratios for major petroleum products range between 2.0&#13;
and 15.0.&#13;
Natural gas pricing presents a special problem in that if the volume of&#13;
gas production becomes sufficiently great, gas will shift from being a traded&#13;
to a non-traded good. For the purposes of our analysis we have assumed that&#13;
natural gas is substitutable for fuel oil and have priced it at the thermal&#13;
equivalent of the fuel oil replaced. This is a valid assumption in the medium&#13;
term and gives us about $4.50 per Mcf in 1980 prices. In the longer run&#13;
natural gas production may exceed the scope for replacement of petroleum&#13;
products. At that point its shadow price is set by its marginal value product&#13;
at border prices which may be expected to lie between the thermal equivalent&#13;
of fuel oil replaced and the liquified natural gas (LNG) net back. For&#13;
further discussion of these issues and an estimate of the longer run shadow&#13;
price of natural gas see Dervis, Martin and van Wijnbergen (1982).&#13;
(h)  Rail Transport&#13;
Rail Transport was the only nontraded activity in which we had&#13;
empirical evidence of economies of scale. Moreover the National Transport&#13;
Study indicated that there was great variability in the price marginal cost&#13;
margin by type or rail cargo, with the bulk of cargo transported at rates&#13;
substantially below marginal cost. For this reason several accounting ratios&#13;
for rail transport are estimated. The principal accounting ratio is that&#13;
applicable to marginal cost and gives the resource cost at shadow prices of&#13;
providing one LE of rail services. The other accounting ratios represent the&#13;
price-marginal cost relationship for various important categories of goods and&#13;
vary only in the amount of the implicit subsidy provided by the rate structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
(i) Road Transport&#13;
Road transport which is both a public and private sector activity&#13;
receives an implicit subsidy from the government to the extent that public&#13;
expenditures on construction and maintenance are not recovered by user&#13;
charges. Although we have not been able to obtain reliable estimates of road&#13;
construction expenditures in a form satisfactory to allow their inclusion in&#13;
long run marginal costs, we have included road maintenance expenditure in the&#13;
marginal social cost of providing road transport services. When this item is&#13;
included in the estimates of marginal social cost they show a net direct&#13;
subsidy of 11 percent of revenue.&#13;
(j) Electricity&#13;
The principal issue 'lere is the extent to which the accounting ratio&#13;
for electrical generation should reflect the long run average costs of the&#13;
integrated grid, including hydroelectric power. The electricity sector has&#13;
largely used the full capacity of the generating facilities of the Aswan High&#13;
Dam, and substantial current demand is being met by thermal power generation.&#13;
Thus, we have assumed that marginal increases in electricity demand will be&#13;
met by increased thermal output in the medium term. The marginal social cost&#13;
of production for thermal generation is estimated to be LE .0464/KwH ($.0663)&#13;
border pounds in 1980.&#13;
There are a few large users in the Egyptian public sector which&#13;
receive electricity at rates as low as LE 0.0035/KwH. Our accounting ratio,&#13;
however, should apply to the "typical" marginal user of electricial power. We&#13;
have therefore used a market price of LE .014/KwH that reflects the cost to&#13;
the "typical" incremental user. The total net subsidy coefficient allowing&#13;
for direct and indirect input requirements of subsidized inputs, is 2.32.&#13;
This means that for each LE 100 spent on electrical power generation there is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
a social loss of LE 232 in forgone government revenue. The implicit subsidies&#13;
are clearly reflected in the accounting ratio for electricity of 3.321 which&#13;
is not quite as high as that of petroleum products, but which substantially&#13;
exceeds the conversion factors for capital and intermediate goods. In terms&#13;
of the choice between more or less energy intensive techniques or products it&#13;
is clear that current tariffs, even excluding some "outliers" such as Kima&#13;
(fertilizer) and Nag Hammadi (aluminum), provide a very poor guide to relative&#13;
social costs.&#13;
(k) Distributive Trades&#13;
Wholesale and retail distribution are particularly difficult sectors&#13;
due to the absence of data on the private sector. We have relied entirely on&#13;
the public sector accounts for estimates of the cost structure of distribution&#13;
activities. In the case of distribution, it was necessary to estimate the&#13;
cost of holding stocks, since interest on working capital is a major cost item&#13;
for these activities. In the absence of better information, we have assumed&#13;
that stocks represent about 15 percent of turnover in both wholesaling and&#13;
retailing, which implies that interest on working capital accounts for 10&#13;
percent of total costs. Since these stocks consist of the various products&#13;
being distributed, the social cost of holding them depends on the accounting&#13;
price of the product concerned. This is a case, therefore, of a situation&#13;
where increased demand for a product as an input into a project leads to a&#13;
further increase in demand to maintain the desired level of stocks. To allow&#13;
for this, we assume that for each good in which wholesale or retail&#13;
distribution is an input, 10 percent of these inputs are inputs of the good&#13;
itself and adjust the input-output coefficients accordingly. This has the&#13;
effect of reducing the apparent distribution margin and increasing the foreign&#13;
exchange and tax/subsidy coefficients from their unadjusted levels. Given the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
distribution margins involved, the corrections are not quantitively very&#13;
important -- less than two percent of total costs -- but the adjustment was&#13;
not difficult so we made it.&#13;
(1) Non-Traded-Agricultural Commodities&#13;
Items subsumed under this heading include vegetables, berseem, some&#13;
food grains, staple starches and fresh fish. An increase in demand for these&#13;
products may lead to a rise in the market price and to: (i) an increase in the&#13;
production of these commodities either as a result of increased effort by&#13;
producers or at the expense of other agricultural output which is tradable;&#13;
(ii) a shift by consumers from consumption of these products to substitutes;&#13;
and (iii) a transfer of income from consumers to producers of non-traded&#13;
agricultural products. items (i) and (ii) comprise the social cost of the&#13;
increase in the demand for non-traded agricultural goods. Item (iii) may&#13;
represent a cost or a benefit depending on the welfare weights attached to the&#13;
incomes of producers and-consumers.&#13;
It is possible to devote great time and energy to the estimates of&#13;
plausible values for these three elements, however, the payoff for our present&#13;
purposes would be rather small. Hence, we have assumed that all of the&#13;
increase in output will arise at the expense reduced output of tradable&#13;
agricultural crops. The marginal social cost of production is therefore found&#13;
by taking as input coefficients the proportions in total sown acreage of the&#13;
principal tradable agricultural commodities. This procedure ignores elements&#13;
(ii) and (iii) above, and any detailed use of accounting prices to evaluate&#13;
agricultural projects would require a more careful examination of the social&#13;
costs and benefits of non-traded agricultural production.&#13;

Appendix 2-2: An Accounting Price for Cotton&#13;
The accounting price for cotton is an important parameter both for&#13;
appraisal of agricutural projects and as an element in establishing the social&#13;
value of the marginal product of labor in agriculture. Egypt is a major world&#13;
producer of cotton, supplying more than 50 percent of world demand for extra&#13;
long staple on average since the 1950's. Because of this high share of the&#13;
world cotton market, it is inappropriate to treat the world demand for Egypt's&#13;
cotton exports as infinitely elastic.&#13;
Marginal export revenue may be derived from estimates of two sets of&#13;
parameters, the expected future world market price of cotton and the price&#13;
elasticity of demand for Egyptian cotton exports. It is possible to use a&#13;
simple residual demand model to derive an estimate of the elasticity of demand&#13;
for Egypt's cotton exports from data on the world elasticity of demand for&#13;
cotton, the supply elasticity of other cotton producers, and Egypt's share in&#13;
world cotton output. The demand for Egyptian cotton is viewed as the&#13;
difference between world demand, Q , and the supply of the rest of the&#13;
world, Q .Q   = Q -Q . On the basis of this relationship, the&#13;
elasticity of demand for Egyptian cotton may be written n e =&#13;
(n -e s )/s9, where n   and nw are the price elasticities of demand&#13;
w  r r   ee                w&#13;
for Egyptian exports and world cotton production respectively, e     is the&#13;
supply elasticity of all other cotton producers taken collectively, and s&#13;
and s are the shares of total world production held by Egypt and the rest&#13;
of the world.&#13;
Empirircal estimates of these paramters are quite uncertain. Recent&#13;
research indicates that the long run price elasticity of demand for extra long&#13;
staple cotton by the industrial countries is approximately -.65. (World Bank&#13;
(1981)). Because Egypt maintains significant marketing agreements with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
bilateral payments trading partners, this elasticity may not be appropriate as&#13;
a basis for the evaluation of the elasticity of demand for total cotton&#13;
exports.&#13;
The structure of marketing arrangements in Egypt's principal&#13;
competitors (Sudan, Morocco, and Peru) is such that in each case the&#13;
government intervenes via marketing arrangements or variable tax levies to set&#13;
a producer price, distinct from the world price of cotton. Hence, the&#13;
elasticity of supply is composed of the product of the elasticity of the&#13;
producer price with respect to the world price and the elasticity of supply&#13;
with respect to the producer price. Little is known about either parameter.&#13;
Table A2-2-1 presents alternative estimates of the elasticity of&#13;
demand for cotton under various assumptions regarding the elasticity of supply&#13;
response for the rest of the world and Egypt's share in total extra long&#13;
staple production. Egypt's average share in world production fell in the&#13;
1970's, and predictions of its future value are difficult. The average share&#13;
for the period 1970-1977 was 43 percent. This suggests that, given reasonable&#13;
values for the long run elasticity of supply from competitors, the elasticity&#13;
of demand facing Egypt is probably in the range of -2 to -3.&#13;
Table A2-2-2 explores the sensitivity of the estimated marginal&#13;
export revenue for extra long staple cotton to estimates of the export price&#13;
FOB and the elasticity of foreign demand. Values for the marginal export&#13;
revenue range from LE 400 to LE 666 per ton. We take as our provisional&#13;
estimate of the marginal export revenue a value of LE 600 per ton.&#13;
There is, however, evidence to suggest that extra long staple cotton&#13;
is technically fully substitutable for long staple. Since Egypt is not a&#13;
major supplier of long staple to the world market, it may be viewed as a price&#13;
taker in the market for long staple substitutes. In 1979 the international&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
price of long staple was LE 800 FOB, and this price presumably sets a floor&#13;
under the extra long staple price. Hence, an alternative estimate of the&#13;
marginal export revenue of extra long staple is given by the long staple floor&#13;
price of LE 800. There would be, however, some costs associated with&#13;
marketing of extra long staple as a long staple substitute, and therefore the&#13;
realized marginal revenue would probably lie somewhat below the FOB price.&#13;

To provide an accounting ratio applicable to the farmgate price we&#13;
deduct the costs of transportation and processing. The calculation is set out&#13;
in Table A2-2-3. The ratio of the accounting price to the farmgate price lies&#13;
in the .920 - 1.41 range. The midpoint of the range is 1.17, which, lacking&#13;
further insight into the costs associated with marketing, we choose on our&#13;
best estimates.&#13;

Chapter 3: Discount Rates, The Value of Public Income,&#13;
and Consumption Distribution Weights&#13;
In this chapter we estimate social pricing parameters for the&#13;
distribution of consumption across generations and among contemporaries. The&#13;
first of these distributional issues involves estimation of discount rates for&#13;
project appraisal. We begin by estimating the marginal productivity of&#13;
capital at border prices. This provides us with an important efficiency&#13;
pricing parameter and with part of the empirical basis for estimating the&#13;
Accounting Rate of Interest (ARI). We then turn to estimates of the&#13;
Consumption Rate of Interest (CRI) and the ARI.&#13;
The second half of the chapter attempts to establish a weighting&#13;
system for the distribution of consumption among contemporaries in Egypt and&#13;
employs our estimates of both intertemporal and contemporary income&#13;
distribution parameters to establish a likely value for uncommitted public&#13;
sector income relative to private consumption. In the course of our work on&#13;
estimating distributional weights, we also gain some insights into the likely&#13;
social value of Egypt's consumption subsidies and develop some rather striking&#13;
estimates of rural-urban price differentials.&#13;
The major characteristic of social cost-benefit analysis which&#13;
distinguishes it from other methods of project appraisal is the systematic&#13;
incorporation of distributional considerations into the estimation of shadow&#13;
prices and project rates of return. For some shadow prices - for example the&#13;
shadow wage rate - distributional effects can have a major impact on the final&#13;
value of the parameter, and estimates of social and efficiency prices may&#13;
diverge significantly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
There remains considerable debate as to the relevance of social&#13;
pricing in informing operational decisiors. Nevertheless, in an economy like&#13;
Egypt which is characterized by several important policy interventions&#13;
explicitly designed to alter the distribution of income, any effort to&#13;
estimate a consistent set of accounting prices would be seriously deficient&#13;
without some attempt to establish a set of distributional weights. This&#13;
endeavor yields an additional benefit in that it permits us to evaluate (at&#13;
the margin) the efficacy of a number of redistributional policies - food&#13;
subsidies and public sector wage and employment policies - at the same time&#13;
that they provide information on the Government's implicit judgements&#13;
regarding the distribution of income.&#13;
3.1 The Marginal Productivity of Capital at Border Prices&#13;
The marginal product of capital is the net return earned by a&#13;
marginal unit of public investment when all inputs and outputs are valued at&#13;
border prices. Thus it represents the marginal rate of transformation between&#13;
present and future foreign exchange; its value reflects both the past history&#13;
of investment projects within the economy and the likely returns to new&#13;
investments. In a well fuctioning capital market with access to foreign&#13;
sources of finance it will also reflect the real rates of return to lending or&#13;
borrowing on international capital markets. We consider three sources of&#13;
evidence on the marginal productivity of capital: macroeconomic evidence from&#13;
historical data on the Egyptian economy and the DRM model, microeconomic&#13;
evidence on the rates of return at accounting prices to public sector&#13;
investment, and data on borrowing and lending on international markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
(a) Macroeconomic Evidence on the Rate of Return&#13;
Procedures for estimating the average return to capital at border&#13;
prices from aggregate economic data are well known. 1/ The first method&#13;
involves adjustment of the incremental output capital ratio to net out labor's&#13;
contribution to output and to convert from market to border prices;&#13;
q   rA Q     a    L K] (f /f)(1&#13;
where q is the marginal product of capital at border prices, Q, K, and L are&#13;
output, capital stock and employment, respectively and f /f is the ratio&#13;
v k&#13;
of the accounting ratio for net output to the accounting ratio for capital.&#13;
Our estimates of this approximation to the marginal productivity of capital&#13;
are summarized in Table 3-1. Incremental output capital and employment&#13;
capital ratios are taken from recent economic reporting for Egypt and from&#13;
projections contained in the DRM model. As a proxy for the marginal&#13;
productivity of labor we employ the average real wage. The limitations of&#13;
this assumption are made abundantly clear in Chapter 4; it is sufficient,&#13;
however, given the approximate nature of these estimates.&#13;
A second method employs evidence on the share of profits in national&#13;
income and the assumption that the underlying structure of production is&#13;
Cobb-Douglas with constant returns to scale. In such cases&#13;
q MA      (f /f)                                 (2)&#13;
K v  k&#13;
where a is the elasticity of output with respect to capital. Under perfect&#13;
competition and constant returns to scale a may be estimated by taking the&#13;
share of capital in national income. Results of this calculation are set out&#13;
in Table 3-2.&#13;
1/ See for example Squire and van der Tak (1975) or Mashayekhi (1980)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
Because there are substantial rents to the resource, the marginal&#13;
productivity of capital will be overstated in the macroeconomic accounts&#13;
including the petroleum sector. Hence we have chosen the estimate of the&#13;
marginal productivity of capital exclusive of the petroleum sector. Our&#13;
estimated values of q from these methods lie between .150 and .210.&#13;
Limitations of the techniques are obvious, and great reliance should not be&#13;
placed on these estimates.&#13;

(b) Microeconomic Evidence on the Rate of Return at Border Prices&#13;
Microeconomic evidence at the sector and project levels on the rate&#13;
of return to public sector investment may be drawn principally from two&#13;
sources. The first is a survey of 22 public sector enterprises conducted by&#13;
Professor Heba Handoussa (Handoussa (1980a)) which provides data on rates of&#13;
return at border prices and domestic resource costs of foreign exchange based&#13;
on cross section data from 1977. The second source is the economic rate of&#13;
return estimates from Bank projects in the industrial and agricultural&#13;
sector. Neither source is exactly appropriate for our needs, but taken&#13;
together they provide an indication of the rates of return at border prices of&#13;
a rather broadly based set of public investment projects.&#13;
Table 3-3 presents Handoussa's estimated social (border price) rates&#13;
of return to investments in six public sector industries. There is one major&#13;
problem with the interpretation of these results. Data on the capital stock&#13;
of enterprises in her survey refer to book value of assets at historic cost.&#13;
Both inflation and depreciation (in a growing company) will tend to make this&#13;
an understatement of the replacement cost of productive capital, and hence&#13;
will tend to inflate estimates of the rate of return. If we assume that&#13;
companies have been investing and growing at a real rate g, that the rate of&#13;
inflation in the price of capital goods is p and that the capital stock is&#13;
depreciated on historic cost at a rate d, then the ratio of replacement cost&#13;
at current prices, K, to book value at historic cost, H, is:&#13;
K     (g,T)&#13;
H ~~~~(~~~P~~~d7T ~~~(3)&#13;
H        f(gdp+d,T)&#13;
where O (x,T) =T     ext dt        ex    , and T is the age of the oldest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108 -&#13;
capital still in use. For public sector manufacturing we take g= .05, d= .085&#13;
and p= .08. If the companies. in Handoussa's sample are on average ten years&#13;
old, the ratio of replacement cost to book value is approximately 1.92. Thus&#13;
in columns 2 and 3 of Table 3-3, we deflate her rates of return by the&#13;
reciprocal of this ratio to arrive at rates of return at replacement cost.&#13;
These values range from -14.8 percent for metal products to 16.9 percent for&#13;
cement.&#13;

It is also possible to use Handoussa's data to estimate the rate of&#13;
return to public sector manufacturing as a whole. The relationship between&#13;
the financial rate of return and the social rate of return is approximately:&#13;
q  rf                                                              (4)&#13;
fk&#13;
where fli is the accounting ratio applicable to profits - the ratio of value&#13;
added at world prices minus wages at shadow prices to value added minus wages&#13;
at market prices - and fk is the accounting ratio for capital goods.    Thus&#13;
from data provided on financial and social rates of return it is possible to&#13;
deduce the ratio f /fk for individual industries.    These are listed in&#13;
column (3) of Table 3-3. These ratios may then be combined with data on the&#13;
average financial rate of return in four major categories of public sector&#13;
industry to provide an estimate of the weighted average rate of return to&#13;
public sector industrial enterprises. The estimates are contained in Table&#13;
3-4, and the average rate of return at border prices for the industrial sector&#13;
is approximately 6.6 percent. This rate of return is heavily influenced by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
the low level of social profits in the metal products sector which carries a&#13;
high weight in total public sector output.   It is undoubtedly below the&#13;
marginal return at border prices to industrial projects.&#13;
Evidence from Bank Staff Appraisal Reports on recent investment&#13;
projects indicates that returns to proposed investment activities range from&#13;
16-21 percent at border prices. There is undoubtedly a measure of selectivity&#13;
bias in the sample, since Bank projects are undoubtedly among the proposed&#13;
investments with the highest levels of social profitability, but these data&#13;
provide a plausible upper bound for the economic rate of return to marginal&#13;
investment projects.&#13;
(c) Interest Rates on Foreign Borrowing&#13;
If at the margin a country is borrowing from abroad, the marginal&#13;
productivity of capital at border prices should at least equal the real rate&#13;
of interest on marginal foreign debt. In circumstances where the government&#13;
controls substantial revenues denominated in foreign currency, such as oil&#13;
revenues in Egypt, it also has the option of holding assets denominated in&#13;
dollars rather than undertaking domestic investment. Consistent project&#13;
appraisals would reject marginal investments returning less at border prices&#13;
than could be earned by holding interest bearing claims on foreigners. Thus,&#13;
lending and borrowing rates on the international capital market provide some&#13;
additional evidence on the likely medium term value of the marginal&#13;
productivity of capital at shadow prices. The Government of Egypt has&#13;
borrowed from a number of multilateral and commercial sources in the past, and&#13;
presumably will continue to do so. Interest charges on these loans grange from&#13;
the 1979-1980 World Bank rate of 10.5 percent to a level 1.25-1.75 percent&#13;
above the LIBOR rate. This implies at present an interest rate on new dollar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
indebtedness of approximately 20.5 percent. Even this rate may not reflect&#13;
the marginal cost of borrowing, since increases in the volume of debt service&#13;
tend to push up the margin over the LIBOR rate which Egyptian borrowers have&#13;
to pay. The maturity of Eurocurrency loans is also shorter than the maturity&#13;
of the investments likely to be financed out of those loans. Thus, the debt&#13;
will have to be rolled over at terms which are uncertain. These&#13;
considerations suggest that a risk premium might also be incorporated into the&#13;
estimated marginal cost of borrowing. Allowing for a risk premium suggests&#13;
that the marginal cost of borrowing in nominal terms might be as high as 22-23&#13;
percent.&#13;
It is important to ask whether this rate represents a viable medium&#13;
term estimate of the dollar interest rate. Moreover, borrowing on the&#13;
commercial market has been largely limited to short term portfolio management,&#13;
and may not represent terms at which the Government is willing to finance&#13;
medium and long term capital expenditure. If interest rates are expected to&#13;
decline to more traditional levels in the short to medium term, a marginal&#13;
nominal cost of 10-15 percent might be more appropriate. From either nominal&#13;
rate we must deduct the expected rate of inflation for traded commodities in&#13;
dollar terms to arrive at a real rate of interest. Given the importance of&#13;
petroleum in Egyptian trade, it is difficult to make a sensible projection of&#13;
the rate of inflation. For the purpose of this analysis we will allow 8-12&#13;
percent per annum for inflation which suggests a real rate of interest on&#13;
foreign borrowing in the range of 2-10 percent. Potential real earnings on.&#13;
foreign denominated assets are probably in the range of 3-5 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
(d) A Possible Value for q&#13;
Our estimates of the marginal productivity of capital at border&#13;
prices fall within the rather broad band of 6-20 percent. Any attempt to&#13;
narrow this range must rely more on judgement than on evidence, but it seems&#13;
unlikely that the rate of return at border prices for the typical marginal&#13;
public sector project exceeds 10-12 percent. Indeed our evidence on the past&#13;
performance of public sector industry suggests a range of average returns of&#13;
from 5-12 percent, and if one excludes investments in basic metals and metal&#13;
products the observed rates of return tend to cluster in the interval between&#13;
8 and 12 percent. Thus we choose 10 percent as our most likely value for q,&#13;
and we employ alternative values of 8 and 12 percent in testing the&#13;
sensitivity of several of our parameters.&#13;
3.2 The Consumption Rate of Interest&#13;
The consumption rate of interest is the rate at which the marginal&#13;
valuation on consumption declines over time. As such, it is a policy&#13;
parameter designed to insure that the Government's views on the relative&#13;
desirability of present as opposed to future consumption are adequately&#13;
reflected in the system of social prices. A high consumption rate of interest&#13;
implies that the welfare gains from investments yielding a stream of benefits&#13;
in the future are heavily discounted and, therefore, favors present&#13;
consumption over saving and investment.&#13;
As conventionally defined, the consumption rate of interest is the&#13;
sum of the pure rate of time preference and the product of the long term rate&#13;
of growth of per capita consumption and the elasticity of the marginal utility&#13;
of consumption. Of the three components, only the growth rate of real per&#13;
capita consumption can be estimated without recourse to an explicit value&#13;
judgement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
Our estimates of the real growth of per capita consumption ae taken&#13;
from the "base case" scenario of the DRM model for the Egyptian Economy (World&#13;
Bank (1980a)). For the period 1982-1990, the DRM projections indicate that&#13;
growth rates of total consumption consistent with the existing policy&#13;
framework, resource endowment, and investment behavior fall in the range of&#13;
5-8 percent per annum.. The mean value of the year to year growth rates for&#13;
the entire projection period is 7.2 percent, implying an average growth rate&#13;
of per capita consumption of between 4.5 and 5.0 percent. This is not&#13;
inconsistent with historical evidence from the 1970's. Egypt sustained a rate&#13;
of growth of consumption per head of between 5 and 6 percent at constant&#13;
prices between 1975 and 1980.&#13;
Of the subjective parameters, the pure rate of time preference is the&#13;
one on which we have the least information. The pure rate of time preference&#13;
represents the degree of "impatience" of the Government, the extent to which&#13;
benefits which occur in the future are discounted simply because they accrue&#13;
to future generations. (The possibility that future generations will be&#13;
richer and therefore will value marginal additions to income less highly than&#13;
the present generation is allowed for by the growth of per capita income and&#13;
the elasticity of its marginal valuation.) Other writers on social cost&#13;
benefit analysis have suggested plausible values in the range of 0-5 percent.&#13;
Given the Egyptian Government's commitment to long term growth and its&#13;
apparent willingness to undertake investment projects of long gestation such&#13;
as irrigation and land reclamation, it seems likely that the value of the pure&#13;
rate of time preference is quite low.&#13;
In section 3.5 we present our reasons for setting the elasticity of&#13;
the marginal valuation of consumption at one. This value reflects some degree&#13;
of concern for equity, but is consistent with the observed behavior of the&#13;
Government with regard to horizontal equity among comtemporaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
Table 3-5 sets out the range of estimates of the consumption rate of&#13;
interest. As our best estimate we take the rate of growth of real per capita&#13;
consumption as 4.5 percent, the elasticity of the marginal valuation of income&#13;
as unity, and the pure rate of time preference as 1.0 percent, yielding a&#13;
consumption rate of interest of 5.5 percent.&#13;
It is important to note that Egypt's growth performance in the 1970's&#13;
and its projected sustained., if somewhat more moderate, growth in the 1980's&#13;
are the factors that lead to the relatively high estimate of the consumption&#13;
rate of interest. 1/ We have adopted quite modest values of the pure rate of&#13;
time preference and the elasticity of the marginal valuation of income.&#13;
Higher values of these subjective parameters would raise the CRI accordingly,&#13;
with important implications for the accounting rate of interest and ultimately&#13;
for the selection of projects.&#13;

parameter appropriate to the period 1983-88. The CRI is obviously&#13;
time dependent and will vary with the growth path of per capita&#13;
consumption. For a fuller discussion on the time path of the CRI and&#13;
estimate of its long term behavior see Dervis, Martin and van&#13;
Wijnbergen (1982).&#13;

3.3 The Accounting Rate of Interest&#13;
The accounting rate of interest (ARI) simply measures the rate of&#13;
fall in the social value of the numeraire, uncommitted foreign exchange held&#13;
by the public sector. It provides the principal intertemporal link in project&#13;
appraisal by making it possible to express net benefits (measured in terms of&#13;
the unit of account) which occur at different times in comeasurable units.&#13;
Ideally, projects should be undertaken until the marginal rate of return on&#13;
public sector investments when they are evaluated at social accounting prices&#13;
equals the ARI. If the ARI is set too low, too many projects will be&#13;
approved; conversely, if it is set too high, there will be underinvestment.&#13;
At a full optimum with no constraints on public sector saving and investment&#13;
behavior the level of investment will be pushed until the ARI is equal to the&#13;
CR1.&#13;
In principle, the relationship between the ARI, the CRI and the&#13;
marginal productivity of capital is reasonably straightforward. The CR1&#13;
measures the rate of decline in the social valuation of average per capita&#13;
consumption. The parameter v estimated in section 3.6 measures the social&#13;
value of the numeraire relative to average per capita consumption. Hence&#13;
- v/v = ARI - CRI                                    (5)&#13;
where v/v = (dv/dt)/v. Since the marginal product of capital, q, is a major&#13;
determinant of v, under rather stringent assumptions we can use information on&#13;
the rate of return to public sector investments at accounting prices and our&#13;
estimate of the CRI to arrive at an estimate of the ARI.&#13;
If we assume that the marginal allocation of public expenditure&#13;
between consumption and investment remains constant, the rate of fall in the&#13;
value of public sector income is given by the rate of change in social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
valuation of public sector consumption (vc) and investment (v. ):&#13;
v/v =.s v.   /v.   + (l-s) v /v                                        (6)&#13;
inv  inv           c  c&#13;
where s is the share of investment expenditure in total public expenditure.&#13;
Further, we shall assume that the Government maintains the value of public&#13;
consumption relative to the value of private per capita consumption at the&#13;
existing levels discussed in Section 3.6(a); thus Ic/vc = 0. The social&#13;
valuation of public sector investment vi     falls at a rate equal to the&#13;
difference between the rate at which current public investment can be&#13;
transformed into future public income and the consumption rate of interest.&#13;
Thus:    ARI = s (R - CRI) + CRI                                                (7)&#13;
where R is the internal rate of return on public sector investment which&#13;
depends on q and the length of life of capital investment, T. A set of values&#13;
for the ARI is presented in Table 3-6. Three assumed lifetimes for investment&#13;
are considered, T = 15, T = 20 and T =     , which is tantamount to an&#13;
assumption of steady state growth and reinvestment in the public sector.&#13;
Table 3-6 reveals the sensitivity of the ARI to the assumed&#13;
elasticity of the marginal valuation of income and the marginal productivity&#13;
of capital. Elsewhere in this chapter we presented our arguments for the case&#13;
that in Egypt .08 q .12 and n = 1.0. This suggests a range for the ARI of&#13;
4.7 to 7.0 percent depending on the assumed internal rate of return on public&#13;
sector investment.&#13;

T = X      12.00    5.25      7.13      10.88&#13;
A lower bound for the ARI is surely set by the marginal lending rates&#13;
in dollar terms discussed in Section 3.1(c). There we argued that the real&#13;
rate of interest on dollar denominated assets was in the range of 3-5&#13;
percent. The upper end of this range is consistent with our estimate of the&#13;
ARI derived above, but there is some danger that if we select an ARI as low as&#13;
say 5.0 percent too many investments projects will be approved. On the other&#13;
hand, if we set the ARI at 10 percent this implies a rate of change in v of&#13;
4.5 percent per annum which is extremely rapid. 1/&#13;
Our evidence is quite consistent in suggesting that 4.0&lt; ARI &lt; 8.0&#13;
and we shall therefore take as our best guess a value for the accounting rate&#13;
of interst of 6.0 percent. For projects which are very sensitive to the&#13;
assumed discount rate, alternative values of 4 and 8 percent should be checked.&#13;
1/ An ARI of 10 percent would also imply a rate of increase in the critical&#13;
consumption level of 10 percent per year which is very high given past&#13;
performance on the growth of per capita consumption. On this point see&#13;

3.4 Relative Weights for Per Capita Consumption&#13;
The methodology of estimating income distribution weights is now&#13;
quite well established; (see for example Squire and van der Tak (1975), Scott,&#13;
McArthur and Newbery (1976) or Squire, Little and Durdag (1979)). 1/&#13;
In order to estimate the social benefit which accrues when a&#13;
household receives an increase in disposable income, a number of assumptions&#13;
concerning the Egyptian Government's attitude toward increases in the incomes&#13;
of private citizens are required. One of the simplest, and most conventional,&#13;
of assumptions to make is that planners assign progressively lower marginal&#13;
valuations to income as household incomes rise. Most social cost-benefit&#13;
studies have employed a marginal valuation function of the form:&#13;
U'(Y) = k Yn                                      (8)&#13;
where the single parameter n, the elasticity of the marginal valuation of&#13;
income, summarizes the degree of egalatarian bias of the Government. By&#13;
arbitrarily setting U'(Y) = 1, where Y is the mean level of income, it is&#13;
possible to derive the value of the scaling factor k and the relative weights&#13;
to be assigned to marginal changes in income at varying levels;&#13;
d = U'(Y) =  Yn                                   (9)&#13;
y&#13;
Thus, given estimates of the mean level of income Y and the elasticity of the&#13;
marginal valuation of income, n, it is possible to derive a consistent set of&#13;
welfare weights reflecting the social valuation of marginal changes in private&#13;
incomes.&#13;
1/ Because many of these concepts are more fully developed in Squire and van&#13;
der Tak the reader may refer to their work for additional exposition if&#13;
desired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
Because data on incomes by household are lacking in most developing&#13;
countries, it has become conventional to work with expenditure surveys and to&#13;
use consumption expenditure as a proxy for income. This is the approach which&#13;
we have adopted for Egypt as well. Tables 3-7 and 3-8 present the estimated&#13;
values of the relative welfare weights assigned to marginal increases in&#13;
household incomes by income class for both rural and urban households, based&#13;
on the 1974/75 expenditure survey. Interpretation of the tables is&#13;
straightforward. Because household size varies with income, we have chosen&#13;
household consumption per capita as the appropriate indicator of income&#13;
levels. 1/ The positive association of household size with income means that&#13;
the household income distribution tends to overstate the inequality of income&#13;
and hence the dispersion of the income weights relative to the per capita&#13;
distribution. Three possible values of the elasticity of the marginal&#13;
valuation of income, n, are listed in the tables. Given that Egypt employs a&#13;
progressive income tax system it is doubtful that the appropriate value for n&#13;
is less than or equal to 0; for this would imply that the Government places&#13;
equal weights on marginal increases in the incomes of all individuals or in&#13;
the case of a negative value of n that it values marginal increases in the&#13;
incomes of the rich more highly than those accruing to the poor.&#13;
The relation between n and the weights assigned to marginal increases&#13;
in income is quite clear. With n = .50 the marginal benefit of increasing the&#13;
consumption of a household in the lowest income class by one Pound is slightly&#13;
1/ It would have been more preferable to work with income per adult&#13;
equivalent, which would have permitted correction for household&#13;
composition as well as size, but this is not possible on the basis of the&#13;
1974/75 survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
more than three times the marginal benefit of increasing the consumption of a&#13;
household in the highest income class. With n = 2 on the other hand, the&#13;
welfare weight assigned to the lowest income category is more than 100 times&#13;
the weight assigned to the highest. These values probably bound the&#13;
appropriate parameter estimate for n in Egypt, and we shall consider below&#13;
evidence on its most likely value.&#13;
The relative weights summarized in Tables 3-7 and 3-8 apply to gains&#13;
(or losses) in income occuring at urban prices. If rural and urban prices&#13;
differ, the command over real consumption represented by LE I at urban prices&#13;
may differ greatly from that represented by LE 1 at rural prices. Since&#13;

welfare measures in the final analysis should reflect the society's valuation&#13;
of the benefits of changed command over a bundle of consumption goods, it is&#13;
useful to have a set of absolute welfare indicators expressed in terms of a&#13;
constant set of prices. Put another way, if we take the mean level of urban&#13;
per capita consumption as a base, C , what is the relative value of a unit&#13;
marginal increase in consumption accruing to a rural household with per capita&#13;
consumption at rural prices of C ? Such a question is relevant for example&#13;
in evaluating the welfare gains and losses of transfers between households in&#13;
different sectors.&#13;

N4ote that all values are measured in terms of urban prices. Thus the&#13;
expenditure weights measure the relative value of a transfer of LE 0.91 at&#13;
rural prices or LE 1.0 at urban prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Suppose that the ratio of rural consumer prices to urban prices is p;&#13;
then the rural consumption level C    is equivalent in real terms to an urban&#13;
consumption level of C   = Cr/p.   The appropriate income weight to be&#13;
assigned is therefore d   =     U&#13;
r~~&#13;
It is also important to recall that the value of any transfer in&#13;
nominal income between the rural and urban sectors of the economy must be&#13;
expressed in the same set of constant prices. Consequently, a unit marginal&#13;
increase in the income of a rural household has the same value as an increase&#13;
of l/p accruing to an urban household. The welfare value of a unit increase&#13;
in the income of a rural household with consumption level C     expressed in&#13;
terms of urban purchasing power is therefore:&#13;
i     n                                       (10)&#13;
Table 3-8 expresses the weights assigned to marginal additions to rural&#13;
incomes measured at urban prices.    We shall throughout this study measure all&#13;
incomes and gains in income at urban prices. Rural-urban price differentials&#13;
are discussed in Appendix 3-1.&#13;
3.5 A Possible Value for n&#13;
Although it is reasonable to assert that the Government of Fgypt may&#13;
attach lower value to marginal additions to income for citizens in high income&#13;
brackets, it is difficult to establish the precise value of the elasticity of&#13;
the marginal valuation of income (n). Certainly, many public policy&#13;
statements could lead to the conclusion that the Egyptian Government has a&#13;
strongly egalatarian bias. Such assertions are buttressed to an extent by the&#13;
system of urban consumption subsidies and by the progressive nature of the&#13;
system of direct taxes. The picture is obscured, however, when one considers&#13;
the overall incidence of the tax system. Indirect taxes via the system of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
agricultural price differentials fall disproportionately on rural households&#13;
in the low and middle income range and the overall incidence of rural taxation&#13;
crucially depends on the access of rural households to subsidized farm inputs&#13;
and consumer goods. (See el Edil (1980) and Korayem (1980)).&#13;
Other writers on welfare weights have suggested that a plausible&#13;
range for the elasticity of the marginal valuation of income is between 0 and&#13;
5. The only "objective" estimate of this elasticity available for Egypt can&#13;
be derived from the structure of the income tax system, based on the&#13;
assumption that the tax tables reflect the principle of equal marginal&#13;
sacrifice. Marginal sacrifice, the welfare loss to an individual due to taxes&#13;
collected from an incremental LE 1.00 of income, may be expressed as:&#13;
MS. = u(Y.) t.                                                              (11)&#13;
1       1    1&#13;
where MS. is the marginal sacrifice of household with income Y., U'(Y.)&#13;
31                                                       1      1&#13;
is the marginal valuation of income for a household with income Y. and t.&#13;
is the applicable marginal tax rate. If the Government follows a principal of&#13;
equal marginal sacrifice, the MSi are equal for all income intervals i.&#13;
Thus, taking the lowest income class subject to direct taxation as a base and&#13;
specifying a marginal valuation function of the constant elasticity form in&#13;
(8) we may write:&#13;
Ms~      kY -n t &#13;
MS      ~-nt&#13;
Msb      kY -n tb                                                           (12)&#13;
b&#13;
Simplifying, taking logarithms, and rearranging terms:&#13;
ln(ti/tb) = -n ln(Yb/Yi)                                                    (13)&#13;

squares. Income was taken as the midpoint of the range applicable to each&#13;

(a) The Social Value of Consumption Subsidies&#13;
Egypt has a long-standing commitment to a system of consumer&#13;
subsidies which is one of the most extensive in the non-centrally planned&#13;
economies. The subsidy bill ranged from 8 percent of CDP in 1977 to 11&#13;
percent in 1979 and accounted for approximately one third of central&#13;
government current expenditure in both years. Major consumption subsidies&#13;
exist for a wide range of staple food items including, wheat, corn, bread,&#13;
beans, oils, meat and sugar. Subsidizing these commodities represents an&#13;
effort by the Government of Egypt to insulate urban consumers from the&#13;
effects of rising import prices. In choosing the extent of the subsidy the&#13;
Government has made an implicit judgement regarding the value of public&#13;
income relative to private sector consumption. Thus, from a detailed&#13;
examination of the incidence of the subsidy it is possible to estimate the&#13;
value of public income committed to the subsidy program. Using our&#13;
estimates of the relative welfare weights for marginal additions to&#13;
consumption (d) derived in Section 3.4, it is possible to estimate the&#13;
marginal benefit, the increase in consumer welfare relative to the average&#13;
level of urban per capita income, of an expenditure of LE 1.00 on&#13;
additional consumption subsidies. The cost of the subsidy -- that is the&#13;
reduction in uncommitted public sector income denominated in terms of&#13;
foreign exchange -- is given by the consumption conversion factor f .&#13;
Thus, the welfare valuation of a marginal unit of public income committed&#13;
to consumption subsidies is given by the ratio of the marginal welfare&#13;
benefit to the marginal resource cost:&#13;

specified marginal tax rate. Marginal tax rates range from 4 percent for an&#13;
annual income of LE 325 per year to 92 percent at an annual income of&#13;
LE 8500. Results of the regression are reported in Table 3-9. Rather than&#13;
supress the intercept, we have estimated a standard OLS regression which&#13;
permits us to test for the presence of an intercept significantly different&#13;
from zero.&#13;

The results yield a statistically significant estimate of n      .96, an&#13;
intercept not significantly different from zero, and show a remarkably good&#13;
fit. This is undoubtedly an overestimate of n, since we have made no&#13;
attempt to allow for exemptions and other exclusions of income which might&#13;
lower the marginal tax rates in upper income brackets. It does suggest,&#13;
however, that the upper bound for the elasticity of the marginal valuation&#13;
of income should be set at 1. We have, accordingly, taken 1 as our&#13;
principal estimate. For comparative purposes in some calculations we have&#13;
also employed values of n = 0.5 and n = 2.0.&#13;
3.6 The Value of Public Sector Income (v)&#13;
Our unit of account is public sector income, denominated in terms&#13;
of foreign exchange. Because we wish to express the value of changes in&#13;
private incomes relative to this unit of account, we require an estimate of&#13;
the value of public sector income (the numeraire) relative to marginal&#13;
addditions to private consumption at the average level of urban per capita&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
consumption (income). With this parameter (v) it is then possible to&#13;
transform the relative income weights derived in section 3.4 into a set of&#13;
absolute income weights: w = d/v.&#13;
Because at the margin public sector income may be used for a wide&#13;
range of activities -- investment, education, defense, consumer subsidies,&#13;
general administration etc. -- the appropriate value for v is the weighted&#13;
average of the relative values of public expenditure on these items to&#13;
average per capita consumption. As a practical matter it is difficult to&#13;
establish relative valuations for such activities as education, general&#13;
adminstration or defense. In principle, however, a rational government&#13;
will allocate expenditure to equalize the marginal social benefit of all&#13;
areas of expenditure. In these circumstances, an estimate of one component&#13;
of v is sufficient to provide information on the relative value of the&#13;
numeraire in any other activity. It is doubtful that Egypt has explicitly&#13;
followed such a course of public expenditure analysis, particularly with&#13;
regard to defense, education, and general administration. Lacking&#13;
sufficient information to provide independent estimates of the value of&#13;
expenditure in these areas, however, we shall focus on three areas of&#13;
public expenditure where there is sufficient information to estimate the&#13;
relative value of public sector income; consumption subsidies, public&#13;
sector employment policies, and public sector industrial investment. Since&#13;
the Government of Egypt undoubtedly enjoys greater budgetary discretion&#13;
over these three items than over defense and general administration, they&#13;
may comprise the main component of marginal public expenditure, and hence&#13;
provide an appropriate estimate of v.&#13;

i  ij            I&#13;
expenditure group i relative to that for average per capita consumption in&#13;
the urban sector.&#13;
The calculations of the marginal benefits for subsidies of grains,&#13;
oils, meat, beans, and sugar are set out in Table 3-10. In columns (1) and&#13;
(2) we present the distribution of urban households by income class.&#13;
Columns (3)-(5) present the relative income weights by class of household&#13;
for three values of the elasticity of the marginal valuation of income, and&#13;
columns (6)-(10) provide the consumption weights for each income class for&#13;
each of the five subsidized commodities. The marginal welfare benefit is&#13;
found by multiplying the expenditure weight by the relevant welfare weight&#13;
and summing over all expenditure categories. The results show a value of&#13;
the transfer relative to average per capita income ranging from .967 for&#13;
meat subsidies (n = .5) to 1.61 for beans (n = 2). At our preferred value&#13;
of n = 1 the value of the transfer lies in the interval 1.00 - 1.17&#13;
depending on the product category.&#13;
The relative rankings of the welfare value of the transfer are&#13;
similar under any assumption regarding the elasticity of the marginal&#13;
valuation of income. The greatest welfare benefits accrue to commodities&#13;
which have the highest expenditure weights for low income households, beans&#13;
and grains, and the lowest benefits accrue to high income consumption goods&#13;
such as meat and sugar. Indeed, in the case of meat subsidies the&#13;
Government could achieve approximately the same welfare benefit by&#13;
transferring income directly to individuals at random.&#13;

The cost of the transfer per unit of subsidy is given by the&#13;
consumption conversion factor (f ) for urban consumption, since this&#13;
represents the commitment of foreign exchange per unit of income&#13;
transferred. In Section 2.3, we estimated that the consumption conversion&#13;
ratio was 1.11 for urban consumption. In Table 3-11, we therefore&#13;
calculate the implied value of public income committed to consumption&#13;
subsidies by product category, v;, and estimates of v subs     Our results&#13;
suggest that the subsidy program has been pushed to the point where overall&#13;
marginal benefits are approximately equal to marginal resource costs. If&#13;
we assume n = 1 the value of v       is approximately 1.0, indicating that&#13;
subs&#13;
public income committed to the subsidy program is no more valuable than a&#13;
marginal increase in the income of an individual at the average level of&#13;
urban per capita income.   If n is allowed to rise to 2, v subs is&#13;
approximately 1.3; a result which indicates the importance of the assumed&#13;
degree of pro-egalitarian bias in establishing the value of public income.&#13;

In evaluating these results, several possible limitations should be&#13;
kept in mind. First, the subsidy program may not represent an optimizing&#13;
decision by the Government with respect to the desired level of transfer. For&#13;
example, if the subsidies on some higher income consumption items are&#13;
maintained essentially for political reasons, it would not be surprising to&#13;
find that social costs exceeded social benefits of those programs. If these&#13;
subsidies are expected to remain at their existing levels, marginal changes&#13;
would be concentrated among commodities with higher relative welfare weights.&#13;
We have no evidence to indicate, however, that the composition of the subsidy&#13;
program is likely to change dramatically. Hence, our average values for&#13;
v     represents the expected future value of the subsidy.     Second, because&#13;
some items are sold by coupon or in ration shops, actual consumption of&#13;
subsidized commodities may differ from the assumed distribution based on&#13;
expenditure shares. At the opposite extreme, we may take the assumption that&#13;
consumption of subsidized commodities is the same for all households, which is&#13;
tantamount to assuming that the transfer accrues in proportion to the&#13;
frequency distribution of households in the total population. This assumption&#13;
raises slightly the estimated value of the subsidy, indicating the importance&#13;
of the relatively high income elasticities of demand for meat, oils and sugar&#13;
in determining the overall value of the subsidy program.&#13;
Finally, it is possible that high income consumers do not use certain&#13;
subsidized commodities. This appears to be particularly true for meat.&#13;
Subsidized meat which is imported frozen is regarded as an inferior good in&#13;
Egypt, and high income consumers tend to avoid purchasing it whenever&#13;
possible. It is uncertain at what point on the income distribution this&#13;
becomes a relevant consideration, however, and we have not attempted to adjust&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
our estimate of v. for meat accordingly. For other subsidized commodities,&#13;
there is no evidence to indicate systematic avoidance or exclusion of higher&#13;
income consumers from purchasing subsidized commodities, but any such tendency&#13;
would tend to raise the estimated values of vsubs'&#13;
(b) The Social Value of Public Sector Employment&#13;
Fgyptian policies with regard to the staffing of Government&#13;
administration and public sector enterprises offer another opportunity to&#13;
observe the Government's own perception of the value of public income relative&#13;
to private sector consumption. The problem of overstaffing of general&#13;
administration and public sector enterprises in Egypt has been widely&#13;
discussed. 1/ At various times public policy has guaranteed employment in the&#13;
Government or the public sector to numerous categories of workers including&#13;
university and technical school graduates, secondary school leavers, and&#13;
discharged conscripts. As a consequence, Egypt has experienced rapid rates of&#13;
growth in public sector employment, and the Covernment sector is characterized&#13;
by large redundancies of two very different groups of largely unskilled&#13;
employees, university graduates with high formal education but few appropriate&#13;
skills, and conscripts with little or no formal education.&#13;
The guaranteed employment program for university graduates may be&#13;
viewed as a failure of the educational pl'anning system, since it was&#13;
undoubtedly originally intended to increase the return to formal education and&#13;
thus to encourage human capital formation. The employment program for&#13;
conscripts, however, was an explicit income redistribution scheme. In 1978,&#13;
the guarantee of employment for all returned conscripts was abrogated and the&#13;
1/ See for example, Handoussa (1980c) or ILO (1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
automatic inflow of new workers has stopped, but the problems of overstaffing&#13;
in public sector corporations are still acute. According to Werner&#13;
International (1976), the labor force in Egyptian textile mills was more than&#13;
four times the size of similar mills in Europe. At the largest integrated&#13;
spinning and weaving mill operated by the public sector employment in 1975 was&#13;
35,400. A North American mill with identical equipment, on the other hand,&#13;
would require only 4,600 workers to produce the same level of output. Similar&#13;
evidence for other public industrial sectors suggests that' despite the&#13;
cessation of the employment guarantee for conscripts, labor has been hired&#13;
well beyond the profit maximixing level.&#13;
The pure transfer component of the public sector employment guarantee&#13;
is the difference between the wage for a marginal unskilled worker and his&#13;
marginal value product. As an extreme assumption, we may take the marginal&#13;
value product of a typical conscript worker as zero. The whole of hie wage&#13;
payment of LE 25 per month (at 1975 prices) is therefore a transfer. The&#13;
welfare valution of the marginal IE transferred to a household with an annual&#13;
household income of I.E 300 in 1975 was: 1.25 (n = 0.5), 1.54 (n = 1.0) and&#13;
2.36 (n = 2.0).&#13;
The cost to the Government of the transfer is given by the&#13;
consumption conversion factor of 1.11. Thus the value of public income in&#13;
terms of consumption implied by this policy is:&#13;
Elasticity of Marginal            Marginal Value of&#13;
Valuation of Income (n)       Public Sector Income (v)&#13;
0.5                             1.13&#13;
1.0                             1.39&#13;
2.0                             2.13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
These values are somewhat greater than our estimates of the relative&#13;
value of public income committed to the subsidy program, largely because the&#13;
estimates are based on transfers directed specifically at households with per&#13;
capita incomes below the urban average.&#13;
There is one important limitation of this method of evaluating public&#13;
income. Because the employment guarantee was specifically directed to&#13;
conscripts, it was undoubtedly intended in part to compensate them for income&#13;
earning opportunities lost while in the military; and for the hazards and&#13;
inconvenience of military life. Thus from the welfare gain associated with&#13;
the transfer we should deduct something for the welfare cost of the income&#13;
forgone while in military service and for the disutility of risk. Indeed, the&#13;
true value of the transfer is the annualized difference between the&#13;
military-cum-public sector income stream and the income stream in a&#13;
conscript's alternative employment less a risk premium. Lacking data for such&#13;
an exercise, we simply note that the values for v listed above probably&#13;
overstate the true welfare value of public employment policy.&#13;
The two components of public sector current expenditure which we have&#13;
analyzed yield estimates of the value of public income in the range .994 to&#13;
1.13 (n = 0.5), .985 to 1.39 (n = 1) and 1.29 to 2.13 (n = 2). If our&#13;
argument concerning the likely overestimate of the value of income committed&#13;
to the employment program is correct, the best estimate probably lies toward&#13;
the bottom end of the interval. Hence we take as our estimate of the value of&#13;
public sector income committed to consumption .95 for n = .5, 1.00 for n = 1.0&#13;
and 1.30 for n = 2.0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
(c) The Value of Public Sector Investment&#13;
Investment makes possible a stream of future consumption, the present&#13;
social value of which depends on the marginal productivity of public sector&#13;
industrial activities, the consumption rate of interest, and the social value&#13;
of the incremental consumption made possible by the investment activity. In&#13;
this section we bring together our previous estimates of these parameters to&#13;
provide an estimate of v. nv, the value of public sector resources committed&#13;
to investment relative to consumption at the average level of urban per capita&#13;
income.&#13;
In section 3.1, we considered the marginal social productivity of&#13;
public sector investments. Based on the best available data, the average rate&#13;
of return to public industrial activities at border prices was found to lie in&#13;
the range of 8 - 12 percent. This level of performance at border prices is&#13;
relatively good, and we anticipate that future investments in the public&#13;
sector are unlikely to yield significantly higher marginal productivities of&#13;
capital.&#13;
To determine the value of public sector investment in terms of&#13;
consumption,-we need to identify the uses to which the returns to investment&#13;
are put. In Egypt there are essentially three possible outcomes for the use&#13;
of the incremental profits of public sector enterprises. First the profits&#13;
may be saved and reinvested. This may occur either at the level of the&#13;
enterprise, via retained earnings or in the form of transfers to the&#13;
consolidated public sector account which are subsequently channeled back into&#13;
the investment budget. Second, a portion of the earnings of public sector&#13;
enterprises may leak into private sector consumption in the form of increased&#13;
wage payments. This outcome is most likely to occur if the Government of&#13;
Egypt continues to expand the guaranteed employment schemes for certain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
categories of public sector workers.    Finally, profits from the public&#13;
enterprises may be transfered to public sector current expenditure.&#13;
It is unlikely that a significant amount of profits from new&#13;
industrial investments will leak into the private sector in the form of&#13;
increased wage payments. Recent reforms in public enterprise management have&#13;
sought to free enterprises from the requirements to hire workers in excess of&#13;
their needs. Thus, barring a major return to the guaranteed employment&#13;
programs of the past, the only leakage via the wage bill would be as a&#13;
consequence of the bidding up of wages for certain skill categories of&#13;
workers. We shall consider this possibility in greater detail in our&#13;
discussion of the labor market in Chapter 4, but given the capital intensity&#13;
of most public sector industrial investments, apy leakage via increased wage&#13;
payments is likely to be small. Hence, we assume that the entire return to&#13;
public investments accrues to the public sector. The social value of that&#13;
return is;&#13;

where s is the marginal propensity to save out of public sector income, vc&#13;
is the marginal social value of public sector current expenditure relative to&#13;
average urban per capita consumption, and CRI is the consumption rate of&#13;
interest.   Assuming vinv and vc to be constant over the time horizon&#13;
involved, we obtain:&#13;
Vi      [(l-s) v q *(i,t)]/ [CRI - sq *(i,t)]                            (16)&#13;
w"ere * (i, t) =1 - (1CR)T,&#13;
w-iere         ~~(1+CRI)-&#13;
It is apparent that the value of vi     depends crucially on two&#13;
parameters which we have not previously discussed, the marginal propensity to&#13;
save out of public sector income, s, and the assumed lifetime of public&#13;
investment, T. Public sector savings behavior in Egypt is particularly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
difficult to predict.   Between 1974 and 1979 there was great variation in the&#13;
level of public savings. A simple estimate of the marginal propensity to save&#13;
out of total pubic sector income yeilds the following parameter values:&#13;
SAVINGS =   - 296.5  +  .261 INCOME       R2 = .661&#13;
(280.1)    (.093)         (Standard Errors)&#13;
indicating a marginal propensity to save of approximately 26 percent. The&#13;
marginal propensity to save implicit in the base run projections of the DRM&#13;
model works out to be .225 over the period 1980-1990.     There is one reason to&#13;
believe, however, that these estimates of the marginal propensity to save out&#13;
of total public sector income may understate somewhat the propensity to save&#13;
out of industrial investments. Handousse (1980b) has indicated that there is&#13;
a growing tendency among public sector enterprises to retain earnings for&#13;
self-finance of investments in the form of general reserves, rather than to&#13;
declare the whole of net returns as profits and transfer the stipulated 90&#13;
percent to the treasury. In these circumstances, enterprise accounts&#13;
understate the operating surplus of the public sector and the level of savings&#13;
out of economic profits of public sector industrial investments. Without a&#13;
detailed examination of the accounting practices of the enterprises concerned&#13;
it is impossible to determine the extent to which we should revise our&#13;
estimate of the marginal propensity to save upward. For this reason, we&#13;
experiment with three values of the marginal propensity to save: 0, .25, and&#13;
.50. We also experiment with two values of T. First we assume that the&#13;
public industrial sector saves and grows at a constant rate with a constant&#13;
marginal product of capital q; this is equivalent to assuming that T = oo.&#13;
Such an assumption is not tenable in the long run and has important&#13;
implications for the Accounting Rate of Interest as we noted in Section 3.3&#13;
but it does permit us to establish an upper bound for the value of v .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
As an alternative we have taken T = 15, which is a reasonable estimate of the&#13;
period over which the parameters in (16) may be expected to remain stable.&#13;
The results of our estimates of the value of public income committed&#13;
to investment appear in Table 3-12. The extreme sensitivity of this parameter&#13;
to assumptions regarding savings rates, the lifetime of the investment, and&#13;
the marginal productivity of capital is readily apparent from the table. For&#13;
our best guess as to the savings rate of s = .25 and of n = 1.00 our estimates&#13;
of vi   range between .75(q = .08; T = 15) and 3.60 (q = .12; T = K ).     A&#13;
simple average of the results yields a value of v.     = 1.80.   This is not an&#13;
in v&#13;
unreasonable value and is consistent with a fairly wide range of values for&#13;
the marginal propensity to save, the marginal productivity of capital, and the&#13;
lifetime of the investment.&#13;

(d) The Value of Public Income - v&#13;
The results of our various estimates are set out in Table 3-15. For&#13;
both n = 0.5 and n = 1.0 the rankings of the value of income committed to&#13;
alternative uses is the same, consumption subsidies followed by public&#13;
employment, and finally industrial investment with the greatest social value.&#13;
For n = 2.0, the social value of industrial investment is very low, reflecting&#13;
the high consumption rate of interest relative to the marginal social&#13;
productivity of capital. The reader should also bear in mind our cautionary&#13;
remarks regarding the estimate of the social value of the employment guarantee&#13;
which could conceivably reverse the rankings of the two components of&#13;
consumption expenditure.&#13;
Table 3-13; Best Estimates of the Value of Public Income&#13;
in Alternative Uses&#13;
Elasticity of the Marginal Valuation of Income&#13;
m = 0.5          m = 1.0         m = 2.0&#13;
Consumption subsidies                 .92              .99             1.31&#13;
Public Employment Policy             1.13             1.39             2.13&#13;
Industrial Investment                4.74             1.80             1.05&#13;
The greater consistency of the estimates for n = 1 and for n = 0.5&#13;
provides weak support for our assertion that the elasticity of the marginal&#13;
valuation of income in Egypt probably does not exceed unity. We are now in a&#13;
position to arrive at an overall estimate of the value of v. Taking our best&#13;
estimates of the value of public consumption and investment and weighting by&#13;
the proportions of public expenditure at the margin, we arrive at a weighted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
average value of public income relative to average urban per capita&#13;
consumption. Our best guess of the investment weight, and the one consistent&#13;
with our estimates of the value of public investment, is .25. Hence the&#13;
overall estimate of v is:&#13;
Estimate of n           Estimate of v&#13;
0.5                     1.,90&#13;
1.0                     1.20&#13;
2.0                     1.24&#13;
Thus, whether n = 1 or n = 2 the resulting value of public income is not very&#13;
different, because the value of capital expenditure falls as n rises, while&#13;
the value of current expenditure moves in the opposite direction.&#13;
Nevertheless, we have sound reasons to prefer a value of n approximately equal&#13;
to unity, which suggests that the preferred value of v is 1.2.&#13;
3.7 Consumption Distribution Weights and the Critical Consumption Level&#13;
In this section we combine our estimates of the relative weights&#13;
assigned to marginal changes in consumption (d) and the value of public income&#13;
(v) to produce a set of absolute consumption distribution weights ( LA= d/v)&#13;
which give the value of marginal changes in the consumption of household&#13;
relative to the value of uncommitted public income. We also use our estimated&#13;
consumption weights to estimate the critical consumption level, that level of&#13;
per capita consumption at which the Government is indifferent between&#13;
transferring a marginal unit of income to individuals at that level and&#13;
retaining the income for other Public sector uses, and we examine independent&#13;
evidence on the critical consumption level as a check on the consistency of&#13;
our system of welfare weights.&#13;
&#13;

(a) Consumption Distribution Weights&#13;
Consumption distribution weights by household expenditure category&#13;
for both rural and urban consumption are presented in Tables 3-14 and 3-15.&#13;
The tables reveal the increased concern for equity manifested by greater&#13;
values of n. Indeed, with n set equal to .5 there is no level of household&#13;
income at which the Governm,ent deems a transfer of income to private&#13;
individuals as equal in value to uncommitted public income. Two kinds of&#13;
weighted averages are calculated. In the first in which numbers of households&#13;
are the weights, we obtain the expected welfare value of a marginal transfer&#13;
of income to a household drawn at random.&#13;

The second uses expenditure shares as weights and therefore provides the&#13;
expected welfare value of a transfer of income which accrues to households in&#13;
proportion to their expenditure.&#13;
(d) The Critical Consumption Level&#13;
We can also use the results to calculate the critical consumption&#13;
level - the level of per capita income at which marginal increases in private&#13;
consumption are considered socially as valuable as uncommitted public income.&#13;
At the critical consumption level C*, the welfare value of the transfer of&#13;
LE 1.00 expressed in terms of the numeraire must equal the social cost of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
providing the transfer in terms of the numeraire, which is given by the&#13;
consumption conversion ratio: thus    (C*) = d(C*)/v = f and&#13;
C* = C (v f )lIn     Estimates of the rural and urban critical consumption&#13;
c&#13;
level are listed in Tables 3-14 and 3-15. Not surprisingly, given the&#13;
closeness of the estimated values of v, the critical consumption levels for n&#13;
1 and n = 2 are also rather close together. Both are less than the urban&#13;
per capita average of LE 97.9. Thus, a transfer of income to households with&#13;
per capita levels of income equal to or greater than the urban average is&#13;
considered socially less valuable than public income.&#13;
In the rural economy, the role of the lower foreign exchange cost of&#13;
rural consumption is apparent. The rural consumption conversion ratio of 1.07&#13;
coupled with the fact that in Egypt rural real incomes are below those in&#13;
urban areas for the same nominal income raise the critical consumption level&#13;
for the rural economy to LE 84.3 for n = 1.&#13;
The usefulness of the critical consumption level as a check on the&#13;
assumed value of n is apparent from the estimate of C* derived when n = 0.5.&#13;
The implied level of household income at a per capita level of LE 22 would&#13;
place the household among the lowest one percent of urban households and would&#13;
not provide an adequate level of income for minimum subsistence. Such a&#13;
critical income level is inconsistent with the behavior of the Egyptian&#13;
Government in subsidizing the consumption of households at much higher levels&#13;
of per capita income, and we conclude therefore that n = 0.5 is inconsistent&#13;
with revealed behavior concerning the distribution of income. With n = 1, on&#13;
the other hand, the welfare value of a transfer of income to a household taken&#13;
at random from the urban sector is equal in value to the resource cost of&#13;
providing the transfer; that is the critical consumption level is almost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
precisely equal to the expected per capita income of an urban household chosen&#13;
at random. For n = 2 the critical consumption level is greater than the&#13;
expected per capita income of a randomly chosen household. This may be&#13;
inconsistent with the apparent efforts of the Government of Egypt to target&#13;
consumption subsidies toward commodities with high shares in low income&#13;
expenditure.&#13;
The only independent estimate of the critical consumption level which&#13;
we have is provided by the structure of the direct tax system. El Edel (1980)&#13;
has estimated the incidence of direct taxes by expenditure class for 1974/75.&#13;
Direct taxes via the tax on wages and salaries begin in the expenditure&#13;
interval LE 400-499. Urban households in this income category have a per&#13;
capita income of LE 71.7 which is very close to our estimate of the urban&#13;
critical consumption level for n = 1 of I.E 73.5. With n = 2, the urban&#13;
critical consumption level of 83.4 exceeds the per capita income of households&#13;
subject to minimum direct taxation. Since a consistent government should not&#13;
be prepared to levy direct taxes on the incomes of households at or below the&#13;
critical consumption level, and considerations of incentives may cause it to&#13;
set the base of the tax net above the critical consumption level, the&#13;
relationship implied by n = 2 is not consistent rational public sector tax&#13;
policy. This evidence from the structure of the direct tax system provides&#13;
some additional support for the use of an elasticity of the marginal valuation&#13;
of income of unity.&#13;

Appendix 3-1: Rural-Urban Price Differentials in Egypt 1979/80&#13;
In section 3.4 we discussed the need to express all incomes in terms&#13;
of LE of constant purchasing power. In this appendix, we estimate the extent&#13;
to which rural and urban prices diverged in Egypt in 1979/80 and arrive at the&#13;
somewhat surprising conclusion that, unlike most developing economies, rural&#13;
prices exceeded urban prices by approximately ten percent.&#13;
There is substantial uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Apart&#13;
from the normal index number problems associated with comparisons of different&#13;
consumption baskets and the usual difficulty in comparing heterogeneous goods,&#13;
a crucial assumption regarding the extent to which subsidized food products&#13;
are available in the rural areas has great impact on the magnitude of the&#13;
urban/rural price index. After some consideration, we have assumed that&#13;
subsidized commodities are not in general available in rural areas. This&#13;
implies that rural consumer prices for such commodities as wheat, maize, dry&#13;
beans, and lentils are set by the farmgate price which in most instances is&#13;
substantially above the subsidzed urban consumer price. In many instances the&#13;
rural urban price ratio exceeds 2:1 for major food items.&#13;
A second expenditure category where there is likely to be a major&#13;
rural/urban price differential and where our information is very incomplete is&#13;
in housing. Rental values in Cairo have been rising very rapidly. It is&#13;
therefore not unreasonable to expect a substantial differential to exist in&#13;
rents between urban and rural areas, but it is quite difficult to pin down the&#13;
precise magnitude of the difference. Our discussions have indicated that for&#13;
marginal housing units of equivalent quality the annual rental in urban areas&#13;
is approximately five to ten times that in the countryside. Since it is quite&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
likely that the differential will widen in the medium term, we have chosen a&#13;
rural/urban price ratio of .10.&#13;
Table A3-1 presents the components of the price index. Expenditure&#13;
weights are taken from the 1974/75 household survey. Because incomes have&#13;
been rising quite rapidly since the survey was completed, it is likely that&#13;
the expenditure patterns reported there overstate the share of agricultural&#13;
commodities in consumer expenditure and understate the shares of housing and&#13;
consumer durables. This is likely to impart some upward bias in our estimates&#13;
of the average price ratio.&#13;
Column 4 of Table A3-1 gives the price ratios finally adopted for&#13;
each expenditure category. Rural farmgate prices were converted to retail&#13;
equivalents by adding margins for transport and distribution. For households&#13;
in which there is substantial autoconsumption or those in which incomes are&#13;
received as payments in kind the price differential is accordingly&#13;
overstated. Where no direct price comparison could be made, we assumed that&#13;
rural and urban prices were the same. For some imported (or importable)&#13;
manufactured goods rural prices are likely to be higher than those in urban&#13;
areas. This would tend to reinforce our picture of higher average rural&#13;
relative prices and may offset to some extent the upward biases noted above.&#13;
Using urban weights the rural urban price differential is estimated&#13;
to be about 3 percent. It exceeds 21 percent on the basis of rural&#13;
expenditure shares, which are more heavily weighted toward subsidized&#13;
agricultural commodities. The geometric mean of the two is 1.12, which we&#13;
have rounded down to 1.10 to reflect the possible upward bias in our&#13;
estimates. Indeed, we would not go far wrong if we assumed that rural and&#13;
urban prices were approximately the same.&#13;

Chapter 4: Shadow Wage Rates for Skilled and Unskilled Labor&#13;
In this chapter we consider the shadow wage rate for skilled and&#13;
unskilled labor in Egypt. The principles underlying the estimation of the&#13;
shadow wage are by now well established (see Scott et al (1976) or Squire and&#13;
van der Tak (1975) for example), and we shall not rehearse the arguments&#13;
underlying the approach in great detail. Rather, we focus on those aspects of&#13;
the Egyptian labor market which are relevant in determining the opportunity&#13;
cost of labor supplied to various sectors of the economy. In the first&#13;
section of the chapter we briefly review the structure and functioning of the&#13;
Egyptian labor market. The second section presents a general formula for the&#13;
shadow wage and discusses the relationship between social and efficiency price&#13;
formulations of the shadow wage rate. We then consider estimates of the&#13;
shadow wage rate for skilled and unskilled labor in sections three and four&#13;
respectively.&#13;
4.1 Labor Force, Wage and Employment Trends in Egypt&#13;
There are two recent studies of the Egyptian labor market which&#13;
provide a rather detailed picture of labor force, wage and employment trends&#13;
in the 1970's (Sabot, Taylor and Boutros-Ghali (1981 and ILO (1980)). Rather&#13;
than summarize their findings we shall focus on those aspects of wage and&#13;
employment trends which have particular relevance for our estimates of&#13;
accounting prices for labor.&#13;
Tables 4-1 and 4-2 present the available information on the&#13;
distribution of employment by sector. Over the past 30 years the sectoral&#13;
structure of employment in Egypt has changed significantly. Agriculture's&#13;
share in total employment declined from 58.4 percent in 1947 to 43.8 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
in 1976. Prior to 1970, although agriculture's share in total employment&#13;
declined, the absolute size of the agricultural labor force continued to grow&#13;
slowly. There is now, however, evidence to suggest that the agricultural&#13;
labor force has begun to decline in absolute size. Indeed labor force surveys&#13;
show a rapid decline in male agricultural employment between 1972 and 1979.&#13;
It is not known, however, to what extent this represents a permanent reduction&#13;
in the agricultural labor force, since little is known about the permanence of&#13;
the migration or its effect on the participation of women and children in the&#13;
agricultural labor market. The ILO has suggested that there is apparent&#13;
tightening of the rural labor market and some evidence of an emerging scarcity&#13;
of agricultural labor. In the non-agricultural sectors of the economy&#13;
government and construction stand out as leading sectors in terms of&#13;
employment growth, with manufacturing in third place.&#13;
The leading role of government as an employer in Egypt has important&#13;
implications for the structure and functioning of labor markets in the formal&#13;
sector of the economy. The most important employment generating government&#13;
policies have been the expansion of and overstaffing in the public sector,&#13;
both in public administration and the public sector enterprises. From 1966 to&#13;
1973 government employment - excluding the armed forces - grew at 6.7 percent&#13;
per annum. From 1973 to 1978 the rate of increase was 7.0 percent. In the&#13;
public industrial enterprises managers were compelled to hire labor in excess&#13;
of their requirements and prohibited from making labor, once engaged,&#13;
redundant. In addition, the public enterprises were at various times&#13;
compelled to hire all university graduates and returned conscripts from the&#13;
&#13;

armed forces. The result of these employment policies has been to leave the&#13;
public sector overstaffed with unskilled workers of two very different types,&#13;
largely illiterate former conscripts and highly educated graduates with few&#13;
specific industrial skills. Recent innovations have released public&#13;
enterprises from the requirement to guarantee employment to conscripts and&#13;
have increased the scope for managerial discretion in hiring and firing of&#13;
labor, but there remains a substantial hangover of redundancies from the time&#13;
of the employment drive. In some enterprises, the size of the labor force is&#13;
sufficiently large to introduce the possibility that the marginal product of&#13;
labor is in fact negative, since workers require supervision and&#13;
administration without contributing to output. The extent of overstaffing in&#13;
the public sector and government is difficult to pinpoint, but the ILO has&#13;
estimated that between 1960 and 1976 perhaps as many as 750,000 jobs were&#13;
created in excess of employment requirements.&#13;
The market for skilled labor in contrast has been characterized by&#13;
growing shortages of workers particularly in construction trades and some&#13;
skilled industrial occupations. In recent years, Eygpt has experienced a&#13;
tremendous increase in the scale of external migration of its labor force.&#13;
The number of Egyptians working abroad in 1965 was estimated to be&#13;
approximately 100,000, while in .1976 the figure had reached 1.4 million.&#13;
Out-migration has reduced the rate of growth of the labor force from&#13;
approximately 3 percent per year to 2 percent, with consequent tightening in&#13;
at least some segments of the labor market.&#13;
Thus, the picture of employment trends which enmerges is one of&#13;
increasing scarcity of labor in the agricultural sector, largely as a result&#13;
of pull factors from external migration, government employment and military&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

conscription. Surplus labor appears to be concentrated in the public sector,&#13;
certain types of small-scale agriculture and perhaps in the urban informal&#13;
sector. Among skilled workers there is increasing tightening of the labor&#13;
market in response to external migration. The construction industry is one&#13;
area of acute labor shortage, particularly in skilled trades.&#13;
Recent wage trends appear to reflect the tightening of the labor&#13;
market. Wage formation in Egypt runs from the government and public&#13;
enterprises with their rigid pay scales and grades which exhibit little if any&#13;
response to market forces to the market for hired agricultural labor with its&#13;
apparently highly flexible wage ranges which adjust to clear markets in a&#13;
reasonably efficient fashion. In between are the private industrial&#13;
enterprises which are subject to minimum wage legislation and unionization and&#13;
the small scale and casual sectors, about which very little is known.&#13;
The available information on money wages by sector is summarized in&#13;
Table 4-3. The data are subject to substantial error but they are indicative&#13;
of broad trends. Between 1966 and 1972 both agricultural wages and government&#13;
wages were largely static and therefore declining in real terms. After 1972&#13;
agricultural wages experienced rapid increases while the government wage&#13;
levels increased at more moderate nominal rates. The tightening of the labor&#13;
market in construction is not readily apparent from Table 4-3, but an&#13;
alternative wage series reported in Table 4-4 reveals the extent of wage&#13;
increases in the construction sector.&#13;
Wage differentials in Egypt are large as is the case in most&#13;
developing economies. Table 4-5 shows wage rates on a daily basis for&#13;
selected major sectors in 1966 and 1976. There has been some narrowing of the&#13;
differential between agriculture and public employment in both manufacturing&#13;

4.2 A General Formula for the Shadow Wage&#13;
Consider a project which employs an additional worker. In principle,&#13;
the worker could be drawn from anywhere in the economy, and the social cost of&#13;
employing him in sector i is given by:&#13;
SWR. = z p.(M. + C. - B.)               (1)&#13;
1   J J   J     J    J&#13;
where&#13;
p. =   the probability that the worker will be drawn from sector j&#13;
into sector i;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -&#13;
M. =   the value at accounting prices of the output foregone by&#13;
withdrawing a worker from his previous occupation i into&#13;
occupation j;&#13;
C  =   the social cost in terms of the numeraire of providing the&#13;
additional,resources required to meet any extra consumption,&#13;
and savings of the worker and his household arising from the&#13;
excess of wages in sector (i) over wages in his previous&#13;
employment in sector (j), from any changes in the incomes of&#13;
other household members, and/or from any increase in the&#13;
disposible incomes of workers in sector (j) as a result of&#13;
bidding up of wages in sector (j);&#13;
Bj =   the social benefit evaluated at accounting prices of the&#13;
increase in disposible incomes of workers transferring from&#13;
sector j to sector i, from a change in the income of other&#13;
members of the worker's household, and from any transfer of&#13;
income to workers remaining in sector j as a result of the&#13;
bidding up of wages.&#13;
The values which are assigned to each of the elements of the shadow&#13;
wage and the way in which the probabilities pj are estimated depend upon the&#13;
character of the shadow prices to be estimated and upon the assumed nature of&#13;
the labor market.&#13;
It has become usual in Bank practice to distinguish between shadow&#13;
prices calculated on the so-called "efficiency" basis.and social accounting&#13;
prices. The distinction between them is that efficiency prices measure the&#13;
traditional opportunity cost of using a commodity or primary input while&#13;
social accounting,prices incorporate distributional considerations, either&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
among contemporaries or over generations. Substantial time and ingenuity has&#13;
been devoted to the debate over the relative merits of the two systems,&#13;
largely with the result that the issues have become less rather than more&#13;
clearly defined. It should be apparent that the whole approach of this paper&#13;
has been to argue that project appraisals - particularly in an economy like&#13;
Egypt with a history of policy interventions affecting income distribution -&#13;
should be based on a system of social prices which reflect the relative&#13;
priorities assigned to various policy objectives. Bank practice, however has&#13;
traditionally emphasized the use of efficiency prices. For most commodities&#13;
the differences between social and efficiency prices is negligible, but with&#13;
respect to the shadow wage the distinction is very important. Thus, we shall&#13;
examine the components of the shadow wage expressed in equation (1) which make&#13;
up efficiency and social prices.&#13;
Traditional efficiency prices have been based on estimates of the&#13;
value of the marginal product of labor in its alternative employment expressed&#13;
in terms of the unit of account. Thus the traditional efficiency wage is:&#13;
SWR. =   p.M   = .p.( f.m.)                                           (2)&#13;
i   i  ii     iJ J J    J&#13;
where f. is the accounting ratio assigned to the output of sector j and m.&#13;
is an estimate of the marginal value product of labor in sector j at market&#13;
prices. Note that this formulation introduces a very powerful assumption:&#13;
--p.( C. -B.) = 0                                                      (3)&#13;
that is that the net resource costs of providing additional employment are&#13;
confined to the fall in national income evaluated at border prices resulting&#13;
from a change in the existing allocation of labor.    This is appropriate if&#13;
C. = B. for all j, which implies that the social cost of the resources&#13;
required to finance the increased consumption of each class of households is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
precisely offset by the social benefit of the increased income. This is not .a&#13;
weak distributional assumption; rather it is a very strong one. It implies&#13;
that at the margin public sector income is no more or less valuable than the&#13;
income of any potential private recipient.    Such an assumption is inconsistent&#13;
with the whole tenor of our evaluations of tax and subsidy policy in Egypt and&#13;
with the policy debate surrounding the need to increase public sector savings&#13;
and investment, as well as with the received wisdom of the theory of planning&#13;
and optimal growth.&#13;
Even if we were to assume that wages were the same in all sectors of&#13;
the economy and that the creation of a new public sector job did not result in&#13;
any change in household incomes, if the new job resulted in the migration of a&#13;
worker from rural to urban areas (or vice versa) the combination of different&#13;
expenditure patterns and differential taxes and subsidies mean that the&#13;
resource cost per unit of rural and urban expenditure differ substantially.&#13;
It seems inappropriate to consider the marginal product of labor as a&#13;
legitimate efficiency cost but to ignore the resource costs associated with a&#13;
change in the pattern-of household expenditure. In Egypt, for example, the&#13;
resource cost associated with creation of an urban job is substantially&#13;
greater than that associated with the creation of a rural job. Shadow pricing&#13;
should reflect this phenomenon and guide investment accordingly.&#13;
To this end we also consider what have come to be called "extended&#13;
efficiency prices".   The extended efficiency shadow wage is written as:&#13;
SWR. = Â£p. (M   + C. -&#13;
i   J J   :i    J    U&#13;
= Ep. (f.m. + f .Y.-f .Y. - b(Y. - Y.)                         (4)&#13;
j     jj      cii   C] j            j&#13;
where fcj and fci are the conversion factors applicable to consumption in&#13;
sectors j and i respectively, Yi and Y. are the household incomes in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
present (sector i) and former-(sector j) employment and b is the single income&#13;
weight applicable to the income of all households. This parameter is equal to&#13;
the inverse of the parameter v, the value of uncommitted public income&#13;
relative to urban average per capita consumption. (Note that as v becomes&#13;
large, b declines and the benefit associated with the increase in consumption&#13;
tends to zero.)&#13;
It should be clear from (4) that even if Y. = Y. the extended&#13;
1 J&#13;
efficiency shadow wage will only equal the efficiency shadow wage if&#13;
fci=fcj. In all other cases, the extended efficiency shadow wage will&#13;
reflect changes in the composition and accounting cost of consumption&#13;
expenditure even for equal household incomes.&#13;
Finally, we consider the social accounting wage. This version of the&#13;
shadow wage rate incorporates a full set of differential income weights by&#13;
class of household. Hence&#13;
SWR. =   p.(FM. + C. - B.)&#13;
1   J]I   J     J    J&#13;
=   pj( f m.+f .Y.-f .Y.-b..(Y.-Y.))                           (5)&#13;
i  j         ci. I  C] j  ij  1 j&#13;
where bij is the welfare weight applicable to the change in income&#13;
(Y. - Y.).&#13;
4.3 The Shadow Wage for Skilled Labor&#13;
In setting out the general formulae for the shadow wage in section&#13;
4.2, we noted that the parameter values applicable to each of the components&#13;
of the shadow wage depend upon the structure of the market for the relevant&#13;
type of labor and on the assumptions made concerning the way in which that&#13;
market adjusts to marginal increases in the demand for labor. In this section&#13;
we consider a very simple model of the market for skilled labor in Egypt which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -&#13;
nonetheless captures the essential elements of adjustment to the high levels&#13;
of external migration of skilled labor discussed in section 4.1.&#13;
Our evidence on the structure of the market for urban skilled and&#13;
semi-skilled labor leads to the conclusion that within the Egyptian economy&#13;
wages for these categories of workers are reasonably competitively determined,&#13;
and since there are no domestic restrictions on emigration it may be argued&#13;
that the labor market for skilled and semi-skilled workers is in equilibrium.&#13;
Thus, the marginal migrant should be indifferent between emigrating and&#13;
remaining in Egypt. There is, however, a substantial differential in the wage&#13;
rates paid to homogeneous categories of labor in Egypt and in the Gulf states.&#13;
We, therefore, require a model of the labor market which is&#13;
consistent with our assumption of competitive equilibrium and with the&#13;
persistence of an Egyptian-foreign wage differential for identical categories&#13;
of labor. Such a model of the labor market is depicted in Figure 4-1. We&#13;
assume that the supply of skilled labor is fixed at the level 00'. The&#13;
foreign demand curve for Egyptian skilled labor is given by DfDf and the&#13;
domestic demand curve by D D . The effective supply curve of Egyptian&#13;
skilled labor to foreign employment is given by S S which lies above the&#13;
marginal value product curve D D . Thus we have assumed that the supply&#13;
price of Egyptian labor to foreign demanders exceeds its marginal value&#13;
product (assumed equal to the wage) in Egypt, due for example, to such factors&#13;
as imperfections in information flows, the psychic disutilities of foreign&#13;
migration, the real resource costs of moving from one sector to another, and&#13;
the fact that migrant jobs are not tenured and involve eventual return&#13;

Figure 4-1: Equilibrium in the Labor Market for Migrants&#13;
The shadow wage for skilled labor depends on the process of&#13;
adjustment of this labor market to an increase in the demand for skilled labor&#13;
in Egypt. Assume the demand for skilled labor shifts outward by LL'. The&#13;
reservation wage for Egyptian skilled labor supplied to foreign demanders&#13;
1/ Indeed, a more complete model would treat the migration decision as an&#13;
intemporal optimization problem in which the marginal migrant must equate&#13;
the present discounted values of the stream of benefits and costs of&#13;
migration job search and return to the opportunity cost of remaining&#13;
employed in Egypt. The qualitative results of such a model, under&#13;
reasonable assumptions, lead to a supply price in excess of the static&#13;
wage.&#13;
&#13;

increases accordingly and the effective supply curve of migrants shifts to&#13;
S S . This will raise the wage rates both in the domestic economy and&#13;
e e&#13;
abroad. The increased demand for labor in the domestic economy will be met by&#13;
a reduction in the volume of migrants who are obtained by the bidding up of&#13;
domestic wages as well as by the deprivation of other producers in the&#13;
domestic economy.    The proportions in which workers are drawn from foreign&#13;
and domestic employment into the new project will depend on the elasticities&#13;
of foreign and domestic demand, on the initial allocation of labor between&#13;
foreign and domestic employment and on the elasticity of supply of migrant&#13;
workers. The shadow wage will consist of the cost to the economy of foregoing&#13;
L"L migrants plus the cost of withdrawing L"L' workers from other domestic&#13;
employment plus the resource cost (net of any income benefit) of the increase&#13;
in domestic consumption made possible by the bidding up of the domestic wage&#13;

Let Vf and yd be the elasticities of foreign and domestic demand&#13;
(defined so as to be positive) respectively and     s be the elasticity of&#13;
supply of migrants to foreign employers. Then the proportion of workers drawn&#13;

where sf is the proportion of the Egyptian skilled labor force working&#13;
abroad. The proportion drawn from domestic employment is:&#13;
(1-Pf) =                                                              (7)&#13;

where W   is the domestic market wage and dE/E is the percentage change in&#13;
demand for skilled labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 163 -&#13;
It is now possible to consider the social cost of foregoing an&#13;
incremental migrant. When a skilled laborer is withdrawn from overseas&#13;
employment there is a reduction in Egyptian national income denominated in&#13;
terms of foreign exchange equal to the value of his annual remittances (rem).&#13;
Hence M = rem.&#13;
m&#13;
There is also an increase in the committment of resources to&#13;
consumption and private savings equal to the difference between his domestic&#13;
wage and the amount of total remittances. The resource cost of meeting this&#13;
change in the household income of the migrant and his family is therefore:&#13;
Cm = W (6 kf +(l-6 sk)fc) - (rem)(6 remf s+(- rem )c                        (9)&#13;
where 6sk and 6 e   are the marginal propensities to save out of income of&#13;
households at the level of income associated with skilled workers and out of&#13;
remittance income respectively and f    and fc are the conversion factors&#13;
for savings and consumption as defined in Section 2.3.&#13;
Finally, we consider the benefit from the change in household&#13;
income. Given our assumptions of equilibrium in the labor market, there is no&#13;
net benefit from the change from foreign to domestic employment by the&#13;
marginal migrant. The change in wages is precisely offset by the changes in&#13;
conditions of employment, disutility of migration, differences in real incomes&#13;
etc. Hence we set B = 0.&#13;
m&#13;
We next consider the cost of drawing skilled labor from the existing&#13;
allocation in domestic employment. If we assume that the labor is drawn from&#13;
a variety of industries, both traded and nontraded, it is probably most&#13;
appropriate to identify the value of output foregone with the market wage&#13;
multiplied by the standard conversion factor (f     ).  Therefore;&#13;
M   =W    (f  ).                                                     (10)&#13;
sk    e   sc&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 -&#13;
The bidding up of the domestic wage also results in a transfer of&#13;
income from the consumers of output produced by skilled workers or from their&#13;
employers to the workers employed in the domestic economy. The value at&#13;
market prices of the transfer is:&#13;
(l-sf ) W&#13;
EddW               dE                                                (11)&#13;
dd&#13;
where E d is the level of domestic employment of skilled labor. The&#13;
consumption cost of this transfer per worker (dE = 1) is:&#13;
Csk = EddWe (f ct-fc) = ((S)fWe/Id)fct -fc)                           (12)&#13;
where f    is the conversion ratio for consumption applicable to those who&#13;
ct&#13;
bear the transfer.   In general, we shall assume fct = fc and hence that&#13;
sk&#13;
Finally, we consider the consumption benefit of the transfer:&#13;
Bsk = L(( sf) We)/11U](bt-b k)                                        (13)&#13;
where the parameters bt and b k are the welfare weights assigned to the&#13;
incomes of those bearing and receiving the transfer respectively.&#13;
We put together our best estimates of the various parameters of the&#13;
shadow wage for skilled labor in Table 4-6. First we consider the opportunity&#13;
cost of foregoing one additional migrant. Average remittances for migrant&#13;
workers in 1975 - 1978 (expressed in constant 1975 prices) are LE 917. The&#13;
resource cost of additional consumption is based on two important&#13;
assumptions. First, we take as the market wage of a typical migrant in Egypt&#13;
(W ) an annual value of LE 1092 (at 1975 market prices) which is the average&#13;
of the daily rates for skilled construction workers (masons, carpenters, and&#13;
plumbers) at constant 1975 prices over the period 1975-1977. We also make the&#13;
important assumption that marginal savings out of remittance income are&#13;
significantly higher than those out of domestic employment income.&#13;

The assumed marginal savings rate out of remittance income of 0.5 is&#13;
consistent with the assumptions of the DRM model and with recent evidence&#13;
regarding the commodity composition of own exchange imports which are more&#13;
than 50 percent producer's goods. Our assumed value of the marginal&#13;
propensity to save out of domestic employment income of 0.25 may be too high,&#13;
since as we noted in Chapter 2, we lack any empirircal basis for estimating&#13;
household savings. If the expenditure elasticity of savings is approximately&#13;
1.5 (the value employed by Taylor in World Bank (1980b), a marginal propensity&#13;
to save of .25 would be consistent with a household income in the range LE&#13;
1000 - 1399, and we therefore adopt that value. By assumption we have set&#13;
B = 0.&#13;
m&#13;
The net resource cost of foregoing one migrant is therefore LE 917 +&#13;
289 = 1206, which is our estimate of the shadow wage of a marginal worker&#13;
drawn out of migration (at 1975 constant prices). The ratio of the shadow&#13;
wage to the market wage is 1.10. This accounting ratio is applicable to&#13;
contemporary market price data on skilled labor costs.&#13;
We now turn to an estimate of the resource cost of withdrawing a&#13;
skilled worker from domestic employment. To find the social value of the&#13;
decline in output we multiply our estimate of the market wage (LE 1092) by the&#13;
standard conversion factor of .965. By assumption there is no resource cost&#13;
of the change in the employment, since pre- and post change household incomes,&#13;
behavioral parameters, and accounting ratios are identical.&#13;
To estimate the extent of the income benefit (or cost) which results&#13;
from any bidding up of wages in the domestic economy we assume that skilled&#13;
workers fall in the household income category LE 1000 - 1399. The&#13;
distribution weight appropriate to recipients of the transfer is, therefore,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
.50. Next, we need an estimate of the distribution weight for those losing&#13;
income. If wage increases are passed through to consumers, the impact will be&#13;
to transfer income from households in proportion to their share in total&#13;
consumption expenditure. The income weight appropriate to the expenditure&#13;
weighted average of urban households is .803. This is probably an&#13;
overestimate of the welfare loss of a marginal increase in skilled wages. It&#13;
may be argued that high income consumers account for a disproportionate share&#13;
of the expenditure on skill intensive commodities. Secondly, not all of the&#13;
wage increase may be passed on. That portion of the wage increase which comes&#13;
from private profits will have a welfare cost which depends on the levels of&#13;
savings and consumption by private entrepreneurs and on the social returns to&#13;
private investments. The portion of profits consumed will receive a&#13;
relatively low weight, if capitalists are among the high income groups. But&#13;
the portion committed to savings may carry a relatively high weight, if the&#13;
social returns to private sector investment are high. Finally, if the wage&#13;
increases affect the public sector as well, they may lead to a reduction in&#13;
uncommitted social income, provided that the price increase is not fully&#13;
passed on.&#13;
All of the possibilities described above are likely to occur to some&#13;
extent. Since we have little concrete information regarding which outcomes&#13;
are most likely, we have experimented with two values for bt of .80 and&#13;
.50. In the latter case, there is no benefit from the transfer; in the former&#13;
case, since the welfare loss of those paying the transfer exceeds the gain to&#13;
skilled workers and their households, the effect of the transfer is to&#13;
increase the social cost of skilled labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
Since the extent to which wages are bid up is a function of the&#13;
proportion of workers drawn into employment from the domestic economy and the&#13;
elasticity of domestic demand, the final estimate of the shadow wage is&#13;
sensitive to the assumed value of these two parameters. The shadow wage rate&#13;
for skilled labor as a proportion of the market wage may be written as;&#13;
SWRk                               bt&#13;
We  = 1.10 Pf + (1-pf) if     +     ]                             (14)&#13;
where btf   is the net welfare weight assigned to the transfer, (b t-b k).&#13;
The range of plausible values for pf, the proportion of workers&#13;
drawn from foreign employment, is explored in Table 4-7. The crucial&#13;
relationship involved here is that between the elasticity of foreign demand&#13;
and the elasticity of domestic supply of migrants to foreign demanders. It&#13;
seems reasonable to assume that there is a high elasticity of foreign demand&#13;
for Egyptian migrants, but it may not be perfectly elastic. In order for the&#13;
proportion of workers drawn from-foreign employment to exceed .80 the&#13;
elasticity of foreign demand must exceed the elasticity of supply of migrants&#13;
by a ratio of 22:1. This is not an implausible value and is consistent with&#13;

Estimates of the shadow wage (as a percentage of the market wage) for&#13;
alternative values of the percentage of workers drawn from migrants and the&#13;
elasticity of domestic demand appear in Table 4-8. To interpret the table&#13;
note that if foreign demand for migrants is perfectly elastic pf = 1.0 and&#13;
SWR/W  = 1.10 if it is zero our best estimate of SWR/W     is' 1.22.  The&#13;
range of values depending on the elasticity of domestic demand and the&#13;
proportion of foreign workers drawn into domestic employment is relatively&#13;
compact, lying in the interval 1.07 - 1.19. We select as our best estimate of&#13;
the ratio of the shadow wage to the market wage a value of 1.08 at efficiency&#13;
prices and extended efficiency prices and of 1.12 at social accounting prices.&#13;

4.4 Shadow Wages for Unskilled Labor&#13;
In this section we present estimates of the shadow wage rate for&#13;
urban and rural unskilled male labor. The focus of our effort is to determine&#13;
the social cost of employing an additional unskilled worker in a public sector&#13;
project.&#13;
For the purpose of this analysis the Egyptian economy may be divided&#13;
into four sectors. The formal sector is assumed to consist of private and&#13;
public enterprises which are subject to the minimum wage. The sector roughly&#13;
encompases urban and rural enterprises employing 10 or more workers which are&#13;
engaged in "modern economic" activities. Total employment in the sector in&#13;
1976, the last year for which complete data are available, was 1.03 million.&#13;
The distribution of employees between rural and urban enterprises and among&#13;
categories of industry is estimated in Table 4-2. The casual or informal&#13;
sector consists of traditional non-agricultural activities such as crafts,&#13;
petty trading and personal services. Very little is known about employment&#13;
and incomes in such activities in Egypt.&#13;
The agricultural sector in Egypt consists almost entirely of small&#13;
and medium holders engaged in export or food crop production, and casual or&#13;
permanent agricultural workers. Employment in export production occupies&#13;
approximately one-third of the agricultural labor force and food crop&#13;
production occupies the remaining two-thirds. Hired labor is estimated&#13;
variously at between 13 and 15 percent of the agricultural labor force.&#13;
Unemployment in rural and urban areas forms the forth sector considered. Here&#13;
again data are very scarce, but the best estimate available places the rate of&#13;
unemployment in 1979 at 4.5 percent of the labor force.    (ILO (1980)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 171 -&#13;
At this point it is useful to introduce and discuss several&#13;
assumptions which simplify the application of the general formula for the&#13;
shadow wage. These assumptions specify the mechanisms of adjustment of the&#13;
labor market to an increase in the demand for unskilled labor, and therefore&#13;
define the values of the parameters for the estimates of the social cost of&#13;
labor drawn from each source. First we shall in general assume that new&#13;
workers in the formal sector orginate in one of three other sectors,&#13;
agriculture, the casual sector, or the pool of unemployed. Labor could be&#13;
drawn from other employment in the rural or urban formal sector, but in these&#13;
cases it seems reasonable to assume that any vacancies will be filled by&#13;
workers drawn out of one of the three sectors mentioned. Provided that the&#13;
transfer of occupation within the modern sector has no effect on formal sector&#13;
wage rates, the social cost of obtaining a worker from elsewhere in the formal&#13;
sector may be estimated by finding the cost of his replacement. Thus, he may&#13;
be regarded as having been indirectly drawn from one of the three primary&#13;
sources of modern sector labor. There is one important exception to this&#13;
assumption. As we noted in section 4.1, there is substantial overstaffing of&#13;
many public sector industrial enterprises. If the creation of a new formal&#13;
sector job allows other enterprises to release redundant labor, the social&#13;
cost of that labor will be less than the wage. Thus, we also consider the&#13;
case in which a proportion of workers drawn into new formal sector employment&#13;
originate in the pool of redundant workers in the public sector.&#13;
Second, we shall assume that drawing a worker from the casual sector&#13;
into formal sector employment will result in his immediate replacement by&#13;
another workers from the agricultural sector or from unemployment. In this&#13;
case, withdrawing a worker from the casual sector is analytically equivalent&#13;
to directly drawing his replacement from agriculture or unemployment into the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 172 -&#13;
formal sector. Given the ease of entry from agriculture into casual sector&#13;
activities and the high rate of rural to urban migration, this assumption may&#13;
not be far from accurate. If it is not wholly accurate, it involves making&#13;
two offsetting errors. To the extent that withdrawing a worker from the&#13;
casual sector results in a net decline in casual sector output -- as for&#13;
example, when he is not completely replaced either .by the transfer of another&#13;
worker from agriculture or unemployment or by increased effort on the part of&#13;
remaining workers in the sector -- the price of casual sector goods should&#13;
rise. This will result in a rise in earnings from casual sector employment, a&#13;
transfer of income from consumers to producers of casual sector output, and in&#13;
a decline in the amount of casual sector output demanded. Disregarding the&#13;
net decline in casual sector output and neglecting the resource cost imposed&#13;
by any excess of casual sector wages over wages in the sectors from which new&#13;
casual sector workers are drawn involve neglecting a cost. Failure to fully&#13;
credit the benefit from the increase in disposable incomes of workers drawn&#13;
into the sector and from the transfer of income from consumers to casual&#13;
sector workers involves neglecting a benefit. 1/&#13;
Third, in estimating the social cost of a worker drawn into formal&#13;
sector employment, the effect (if any) of his departure on wages in the sector&#13;
from which he is drawn is assumed to be sufficiently small to be ignored.&#13;
The assumption allows us to take as the shadow wage rate in the sector from&#13;
which the worker is drawn, Mi, the social value of his marginal product.&#13;
1/ When the limited data are applied to an analysis similar to that in the&#13;
appendix, we find that disregarding a potential fall in net output from&#13;
the casual sector will result in an understatement of the "true" shadow&#13;
wage of workers drawn from the informal sector of less than 5 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -&#13;
In the appendix to the chapter a general formula for the shadow wage is&#13;
derived for cases in which the market wage is bid up. 1/&#13;
(a) The Social Cost of Output Foregone&#13;
The preceding assumptions allow us to set the first element of the&#13;
shadow wage rate for formal sector workers, M., equal to the value at&#13;
accounting prices of the marginal product of labor in agriculture or&#13;
unemployment. The value of the marginal product of an unemployed worker is&#13;
taken as equal to zero. Estimating the accounting value of the loss in&#13;
agricultural output requires two parameter values, an estimate of the marginal&#13;
value product at market prices of agricultural labor and an accounting ratio&#13;
applicable to agricultural output.&#13;
There is an active market for hired labor in the Egyptian rural&#13;
economy with a considerable proportion of rural households being dependent&#13;
upon earnings from wage labor and rural off farm employment for their&#13;
livelihood. Table 4-9 summarizes the sources of income of rural households.&#13;
Column (4) of the table shows the proportion of the total number of households&#13;
in the sample which have an income originating from each of the nine sources&#13;
listed in column (1). It emerges that 48 percent of households in the sample&#13;
had income originating from family farms while 35 percent derived at least a&#13;
portion of their total income from agricultural wage employment. Particularly&#13;
striking is the importance of off farm employment as a source of income with&#13;
19 and 30 percent of households reporting sources of income from village and&#13;
non-village off farm employment respectively.&#13;
I/ We find in the Appendix that our estimate of the shadow wage may overstate&#13;
the "true" shadow wage by 5-7 percent if wages are bid up.&#13;

A recent ILO (1980) report argues-that the rural labor market is&#13;
becoming increasingly important and competitive as traditional institutional&#13;
arrangements, sexual differentiation of tasks and cultivation practices are&#13;
abandoned in response to changing economic incentives and technologies. Thus&#13;
it would seem reasonable to use the typical wage rate for hired agricultural&#13;
labor as an estimate of labor's marginal value product. Seasonal fluctuations&#13;
in labor demand, however, result in substantial variations in daily wage rates&#13;
and periods of employment throughout the year, and we must make some allowance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175 -&#13;
for the high incidence of non-farm employment as a source of income since&#13;
withdrawing a typical agricultural worker from the rural economy will also&#13;
result in a decline in off farm output.&#13;
Mohie-Eldin (1980) has estimated that, taking days of employment and&#13;
wages throughout the crop cycle, the average annual income from one farm wage&#13;
employment by male workers was LE 125 in 1976. To this he adds 20 percent for&#13;
off farm employment and arrives at an estimate of the annual income of male&#13;
agricultural wage laborers of LE 150. We convert this to 1975 prices using&#13;
the rural consumer price index and arrive at an estimate of the value of&#13;
output foregone by withdrawing an agricultural worker from employment of&#13;
LE 129 at constant 1975 prices.&#13;
The cost of withdrawing labor from rural employment in terms of the&#13;
unit of account is computed on the assumption that wage labor is withdrawn&#13;
from alternative activities in proportion to its employment.      The relevant&#13;
calculation is set out in Table 4-10. Since the farmgate price lies below the&#13;
international market price for several important commodities, the weighted&#13;
ratio of output foregone at accounting prices to output foregone at market&#13;
prices is approximately 1.18.&#13;
The social value of the marginal product of an agricultural wage&#13;
laborer is given by:&#13;
M = LF 129 (1.18) = 152.22&#13;
a&#13;
at accounting prices which we round down to LE 152.&#13;
Given the assumptions outlined above, the only other sector from&#13;
which a worker is withdrawn without replacement and, therefore, where there is&#13;
possibly some decline in output is in the public industrial sector. Redundant&#13;
workers may have a positive marginal value product despite the fact that it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -&#13;
exceeded by the wage. At this point we shall make the extreme assumption that&#13;
the marginal product of a redundant worker in public industrial enterprises is&#13;
zero. (Indeed some commentators have argued that the marginal value product&#13;
of such workers is negative). We may, however, modify this assumption in&#13;
subsequent work when we have an empirircal basis for estimating the marginal&#13;
productivity of labor in public enterprise.&#13;

(b) The Resource Cost of Workers Transferring Occupations&#13;
When a worker moves from other employment (or unemployment) into a&#13;
formal sector job, his household income will rise by the excess of formal&#13;
sector wages over wages in his previous employment adjusted for any change in&#13;
the earnings of other household members. For example, when an agricultural&#13;
worker migrates to an urban formal sector job, his disposable income increases&#13;
by the excess of formal sector wages over his earnings in agriculture. If he&#13;
migrates with his family, however, household income may not increase by the&#13;

whole of the difference, should earnings of other members decline as a result&#13;
of their move to the city. The second element of the shadow wage is the cost&#13;
in terms of the unit of account of providing the resources to meet the&#13;
increase in expenditure and savings brought about by an increase in household&#13;
income as workers are drawn into formal sector employment. It may be defined&#13;
using the following notation:&#13;
YFi =   household income in final employment in i;&#13;
i = u for urban employment, i = r for rural&#13;
employment.&#13;
YAi =   household income in alternative employment in&#13;
area i.&#13;
s       marginal propensity to save assumed constant&#13;
for all households.&#13;
fs  =   accounting ratio for savings of workers'&#13;
households.&#13;
fci     accounting ratio for marginal increases in&#13;
consumption of low income households in sector&#13;
1.&#13;
fci =   accounting ratio for average consumption of&#13;
low income households in sector i.&#13;
P.  =   the share of household income remitted to&#13;
iJ&#13;
relatives in sector j from sector i.&#13;
P.  =   the value of contributions by relatives in&#13;
iJ&#13;
sector i to the support of unemployed workers&#13;
in sector j.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
It is possible to present two general formulae for the resource cost&#13;
of workers changing occupations depending on whether the worker and his&#13;
household migrate from one area to another to take up final employment.&#13;
Consider first the simple case of a worker changing occupations without&#13;
migrating. A general formula for the resource of his transfer is;&#13;
CFiAi = (YFi -yAi )(sf   + (l - s)f i)                               (2)&#13;
If the worker and his family migrate from one area to another to take up&#13;
employment, the household may face altered relative prices for consumption&#13;
goods. In such circumstances, patterns of expenditure will differ between&#13;
locations and the accounting ratio applicable to pre- and post-migration&#13;
expenditure on consumption will differ. The resource cost for migrants&#13;
changing occupations is given by:&#13;
FiAj   PijYFi(sfs + (1 - s)f .)&#13;
+ ((1 - Pij)YFi    YAj) s&#13;
+ (1 - s)((l - pi j)YFi ci - yAj cj&#13;
If we make the additional simplifying assumption that urban relatives support&#13;
the urban unemployed and rural relatives support the rural unemployed, these&#13;
general formulae also apply to cases of workers drawn from or entering into&#13;
the pool of unemployed. 1/&#13;
l/ Consider for example a worker drawn into employment from the unemployed&#13;
who does not migrate. While he was unemployed relatives contributed&#13;
support Pi    The resource cost of the change in income of the worker&#13;
and his relatives is given by;&#13;
(YFi - Pii)(sfs + (1 - S)fci) + Pii(fss + (1 - S)fci)&#13;
thus receipts from relatives and expenditure by the unemployed cancel out&#13;
and the resource cost is given by the accounting value of the consumption&#13;
and savings out of the wage in employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
Estimates of the resource cost of workers changing occupations are&#13;
contained in Table 4-11. The entries in Column (1) refer to a male head of&#13;
household engaged in the occupations listed. For each type of activity other&#13;
household income is presented in Column (2). This is then divided between&#13;
income accruing to rural and urban households and between consumption and&#13;
savings. Market values are converted to numeraire values using the conversion&#13;
ratios for consumption and savings. The resource cost of a worker changing&#13;
occupations is given by the difference between the resource costs of the two&#13;
occupations required. 1/&#13;
The assumed value of the marginal propensity to save is singularly&#13;
uncertain. For convenience we assume that the marginal propensity to save of&#13;
all households is 10 percent. The national household budget survey does not&#13;
make any effort to examine savings behavior of households. The 10 percent&#13;
value for the marginal propensity to save is similar to that found for example&#13;
in India and Kenya but it cannot be justified on any empirical basis in Egypt.&#13;
All incomes and transfers of income in Table 4-11 are expressed in&#13;
constant 1975 prices. We have previously discussed the origin of our estimate&#13;
of the annual income of a fully employed wage laborer in agriculture. The&#13;
earnings of the rest of the family are based on the same 1977 ILO survey for&#13;
household of the size and composition appropriate to agricultural wage&#13;
employment. In evaluating the household incomes of the rural and urban&#13;
1/ Strictly this may only be done because we have been forced to use marginal&#13;
and average accounting ratios for consumption which are the same. On this&#13;
point, see M. FG. Scott, J. D. McArthur, and D. M. G. Newbery, (1976).&#13;

unemployed we have assumed that there is no change in the earnings of other&#13;
family members. The level of transfers from family members outside the&#13;
household was estimated by taking the household income per capita necessary to&#13;
sustain minimum subsistence (ILO (1980)) and multiplying by the number of&#13;
members in the household at that level of income. The difference between this&#13;
subsistence household income and the earnings of other family members was&#13;
assumed to consist of transfers from relatives. Finally, we consider the&#13;
basis for our estimates of the earnings of fully employed unskilled laborers&#13;
in the formal sector. Earnings of rural formal sector workers were taken from&#13;
the annual earnings of off farm non-village employment from the 1977 ILO&#13;
survey, converted to 1975 prices by the rural CPI. The annual wage for urban&#13;
public sector employees is taken from Handoussa (1980c) which gives average&#13;
earnings of production workers in the textile sector (most of whom are largely&#13;
unskilled) for 1970-1978. The average wage was adjusted downwards by 25&#13;
percent to allow for the effects of seniority and skill composition, and the&#13;
entry in Table 4-11 is the average at constant 1975 prices of this adjusted&#13;
wage for the period 1976-1978. The private sector wage was found by taking&#13;
the average of wages for unskilled construction workers and for production&#13;
employees of private sector manufacturing establishments employing 10 or more&#13;
workers. The annual wage estimated in this way is very close to the adjusted&#13;
wage in the public sector and provides a measure of corroboration of the two&#13;
independently derived estimates.&#13;
Earnings of the remaining members of the household were estimated by&#13;
taking the difference between the average household income of families headed&#13;
by production workers and the estimated earnings of the head of the&#13;
household. The predicted level of earnings of other household members derived&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 182 -&#13;
in this way is quite close to that of a rural household. If correct, this&#13;
indicates that there is little sacrifice of earnings by other family members&#13;
resulting from the migration of an unskilled worker from rural to urban areas&#13;
in Egypt. 1/&#13;
(c) Benefits from Increases in Income of&#13;
Workers Changing Occupations&#13;
When a worker moves from employment in one sector to another, the&#13;
social gain (or loss) resulting from his change of occupations is found by&#13;
evaluating the income gains and losses of all households affected by the&#13;
change of occupation. For example, if an agricultural worker moving into&#13;
formal sector employment remits nothing to relatives, all gains in income&#13;
accrue to the worker and his household.&#13;
The various elements involved in estimating the benefits to the&#13;
worker and his relatives from the change in occupations are summarized in&#13;
Table 4-12. The entry for the "compensation factor" is the pecuniary value of&#13;
compensation for a change in the conditions of work as a result of changing&#13;
occupations. For example, in line 4 the worker is assumed to migrate with his&#13;
family to the urban sector. He remits nothing to family in the rural sector&#13;
but he and his household must pay urban prices. In Table A3-1 the rural urban&#13;
1/ This may not be an unreasonable conclusion for Egypt where there is&#13;
evidence of "circular migration" of households into and out of urban areas&#13;
during the year. Because of the relatively compact spatial organization&#13;
of the country, it is possible for households to engage simultaneously in&#13;
both urban employment an agricultural employment (ILO (1980)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 183 -&#13;
price differential for Egypt was estimated to be 10 percent in favor of urban&#13;
areas. Thus, the worker gains real income at rural prices of LE 33 due to the&#13;
lower urban prices. But there is the possibility that the movement of the&#13;
household from rural to urban employment may entail costs of migration. Given&#13;
our uncertainty concerning the magnitude (and even the direction) of the rural&#13;
urban price differential, we have chosen to consider that the gains in real&#13;
income are offset by other costs of migration and, therefore, that there is no&#13;
pecuniary value of the change in conditions of work in moving from&#13;
agricultural to urban formal sector employment.&#13;
In lines 1 and 2 the worker is assumed to leave agricultural&#13;
employment and enter the rural or urban unemployed. In such cases, relatives&#13;
are assumed to provide subsistence income of I.E 10 per year in rural areas and&#13;
LE 16 per year in urban areas. Urban relatives are assumed to support the&#13;
urban unemployed and rural relatives to support the rural unemployed. Thus,&#13;
the worker and his family sacrifice disposable income equal to LE 119 in rural&#13;
areas or LE 113 in urban areas as a consequence of the head of the household&#13;
becoming voluntarily unemployed. The compensation factor as a result of the&#13;
change in conditions of work is set equal to the loss in disposable income,&#13;
implying that the net loss incurred by the worker as a result of his movement&#13;
into unemployment is zero. The assumption of zero sacrifice may be justified&#13;
along the following lines. If the worker is free to remain in agriculture,&#13;
yet he chooses to be unemployed, he may not feel that he is incurring any loss&#13;
in welfare. His loss in income must then be exactly compensated by an&#13;
increase in leisure and mobility which permits him to seek alternative&#13;
employment, and the net loss resulting from the change in occupations is&#13;
zero. Alternatively, it is possible to allow for the willingness of a worker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 184 -&#13;
to trade current income for the increased probability of finding a formal&#13;
sector job and hence a rise in expected future income. It seems plausible to&#13;
argue that entering rural unemployment will not materially increase the&#13;
probability of finding a formal sector job, and thus the worker should not be&#13;
prepared to make a large pecuniary sacrifice. For workers transferring to the&#13;
urban unemployed, the chance of finding a formal sector job may improve.&#13;
Thus, they may be prepared to incur some monetary loss in order to achieve an&#13;
expected increase in income. Any adjustment, however, would be essentially&#13;
arbitrary, and we shall not pursue the point further.&#13;
The social benefit in terms of the numeraire of the change in&#13;
disposible income is given under two sets of assumptions. In column (7), we&#13;
present the benefit appropriate to the calculation of the extended efficiency&#13;
wage which from Section 4.2 is b = 1/v times the change in income. In column&#13;
(8), we consider the distributional gain associated with the set of welfare&#13;
weights derived in Chapter 3 on the assumption that n = 1. We evaluate the&#13;
welfare function in Section 3 at each income and compute the value of the&#13;
intramarginal change.&#13;
It is possible to use the table to determine the net benefit of&#13;
unemployed workers moving into alternative employment. For example, consider&#13;
a member of the rural unemployed who moves into a rural formal sector job.&#13;
The net social benefit from the transfer of occupations is assumed to be given&#13;
by the difference between the net gains shown in lines 1 and 3 and Table&#13;
4-12. This is strictly correct for marginal workers since the form of the&#13;
utility function is such that if the benefits of moving from YO to YI and&#13;
from YO to Y2 are known the benefit of moving from YI to Y2 can be&#13;
deduced.&#13;
&#13;

r 185 -&#13;
Estimating the Proportion of Workers Drawn from Different Sectors&#13;
In order to draw the estimates of social cost for each of the cases&#13;
discussed into a single estimate of the shadow wage, some measure of the&#13;
probability of drawing a worker from each of the cases examined must be&#13;
constructed. To summarize the relevant simplifying assumptions; workers are&#13;
assumed to be drawn from the agricultural sector, or from the rural or urban&#13;
unemployed. Drawing a worker from the casual sector or out of other formal&#13;
sector employment is assumed to have no effect on employment or wages in&#13;
either sector, and workers drawn from these sectors may be regarded as having&#13;
been indirectly drawn from agriculture or the unemployed. Estimates of the&#13;
proportion of formal sector workers drawn from agriculture and unemployment&#13;
are presented in Table 4-13.&#13;
As a first approximation, it was assumed that workers are recruited&#13;
into the formal sector in direct proportion to their numbers in the pool of&#13;
eligible labor -- represented by the total of agricultural employment, and&#13;
rural plus urban unemployment. Such an assumption is consistent with a&#13;
situation in which the creation of a new formal sector job results in complete&#13;
transmission of information regarding the job opening to all sectors. Workers&#13;
in all sectors are assumed to have equal opportunities to obtain the job.&#13;
In Column (2) of the table we allow for the possibility that the&#13;
creation of a new formal sector job may result in the release of some&#13;
redundant labor from existing public sector enterprises. There is no&#13;
objective method to establish the probability that a worker will be drawn from&#13;
existing redundancies in the public sector. We have, therefore, made the&#13;
assumption that redundant workers are released in proportion to their number&#13;
in urban employment. As a best estimate of the number of redundant workers in&#13;
the public sector we take 20 percent of the public sector labor force.&#13;

The final estimates in Table 4-13 are based on applications of the&#13;
Harris-Todaro model of rural-urban migration. Estimate 3 makes use of the&#13;
simplest version of the model. 1/ Job seekers among the urban unemployed&#13;
equate the expected urban wage to the wage in agriculture, W     = pW , where&#13;
au&#13;
p is the probability of obtaining a formal sector job. In the model&#13;
p = Lf/(Lf + L ), where Lf is the labor force in formal sector urban&#13;
employment and L   is the number of urban unemployed.    If an additional urban&#13;

sector job is created and wages remain constant in both agriculture and the&#13;
formal sector, p must remain constant and dL IdLf = L ILf.     The&#13;
estimates of urban employment and unemployment in Table 4-13, permit a rough&#13;
estimate of dL IdLf of .119. Thus in estimate 3 urban unemployment is&#13;
given a negative weight of -.119.&#13;
Although the simple Harris-Todaro model makes it appear that an&#13;
increase in urban unemployment is inevitable, Scott has argued convincingly&#13;
that in the context of a dynamic model of rural-urban migration there are no a&#13;
priori grounds to assume that unemployment will either increase or decrease as&#13;
a result of increased formal sector employment. l/ Indeed, the limited&#13;
empirical work available does not lend strong support to the Harris-Todaro&#13;
hypothesis in its extreme form. Attempts to correlate the unemployment rate&#13;
in a number of LDC's to formal sector vacancies have been largely&#13;
unsuccessful. This suggests that in Egypt it is conceivable that&#13;
dL /dL  = 0.   In column (4), the proportion of unemployed workers is set&#13;
u f&#13;
equal to zero. Thus all workers entering formal sector employment are assumed&#13;
to originate in agriculture. Corden and Findlay have noted that the&#13;
assumptions underlying estimates 3 and 4 form limiting cases of the more&#13;
general Harris Todaro type model W    = apW  where a is a parameter&#13;
reflecting the average level of risk aversion of migrants. Thus, if the&#13;
Harris-Todaro model is applicable to Egypt the limits of the impact on urban&#13;
unemployment should be given by estimates 3 and 4.&#13;

Our assumptions regarding the sources of rural formal sector&#13;
employment are similar. In columns (1) and (2), we employ the same&#13;
assumptions and proportions as in the case of urban employment. In column&#13;
(3), we allow for the possibility that rural jobs are filled only from the&#13;
rural economy and in column (4), we assume that they are filled wholly from&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
(d) Shadow Wages for Workers Drawn into the Formal Sector&#13;
Tables 4-14 and 4-15 summarize our estimates of the social cost of&#13;
labor drawn into formal sector employment from the four sources in Table&#13;
4-13. Four weighted averages are computed on the basis of the weights&#13;
provided in Section 4.4(c) above. Thus the tables provide a sensitivity&#13;
analysis of the shadow wage with regard to the form of market adjustment&#13;
assumed to take place in the labor market.&#13;
Our estimates of the shadow wage are presented for each of the three&#13;
accounting price methods discussed in Section 4.2. At efficiency prices, the&#13;
urban shadow wage for unskilled labor lies in the range of LE 117-168. Social&#13;
accounting prices yield a similar magnitude for the shadow wage of LE 104-141,&#13;
indicating that given our system of welfare weights the benefits associated&#13;
with the increase in household consumption made possible by the change in&#13;
employment slightly more than offset the costs. At extended efficiency prices&#13;
the shadow wage is substantially higher, in the range from LE 204 to 276. The&#13;
consumption costs of the increase in household income weigh more in the&#13;
extended efficiency price system because of the premium on public sector&#13;
income relative to consumption by individuals at all levels of income.&#13;
Our estimates of the rural shadow wage are qualitatively similar to&#13;
those for urban unskilled labor, although the estimates of social cost at both&#13;

extended efficiency and social accounting prices are substantially lower&#13;
reflecting the lower assumed level of rural formal sector wages and (in the&#13;
case of social accounting prices) the higher welfare weight attached to the&#13;
change in income. Indeed our estimates of the shadow wage at social&#13;
accounting prices are quite low because of the welfare benefits of raising&#13;
rural household incomes.&#13;
All of our estimates of the shadow wage fail to allow for the&#13;
possible effect of bidding up of wages in the agricultural labor market and&#13;
are therefore subject to a measure of upward bias. Our best estimate of the&#13;
shadow wage and the ratio of the shadow wage to the market wage is presented&#13;
in Table 4-16.&#13;

These shadow wage rates apply to formal sector projects in the public sector&#13;
and the "organized" private sector (firms with more than 10 employees) only.&#13;
Our results indicate that in these sectors of the urban economy the shadow&#13;
wage for unskilled labor is about 40 percent of the market wage at both&#13;
efficiency and social accounting prices and about 75 percent of the market&#13;
wage at extended efficiency prices.&#13;

Appendix 4-1: Formulae for the Shadow Wage When Wages are Bid Up&#13;
and Test for Biases in the Estimates of Shadow Wages&#13;
The accounting prices for rural and urban unskilled labor estimated&#13;
in Section 4.4 are based on the assumption that an increase in vacancies in&#13;
the formal sector will not result in any bidding up of wages in the sectors&#13;
from which new formal sector employees are drawn. In this appendix we develop&#13;
a more general formula for the social cost of labor when wages are bid up and&#13;
attempt to estimate the probable direction and magnitude of the biases&#13;
introduced by ignoring the bidding up of wages in our estimates of shadow&#13;
wages.&#13;
Initially, we consider a two sector economy. Labor in the urban&#13;
formal sector is paid an institutionally fixed minimum wage Wf. Labor in&#13;
the alternative sector of the economy, which is assumed to be agriculture is&#13;
paid a competitively determined wage, Wa) which is less than the formal&#13;
sector wage.  There is no urban unemployment, and "Harris-Todaro" effects are&#13;
non-existant. 1/ A new formal sector project is established which withdraws&#13;
labor from the agricultural sector equal to the amount QlQl in Figure A.&#13;
Wages are bid up in the agricultural labor market to W which in the diagram&#13;
a&#13;
results in a net fall in the services of agricultural labor market of&#13;
QlQl- Thus, as we have presented the rural labor market there is some&#13;
elasticity of the supply of effort in agriculture which results from the&#13;
l/ Actually these assumptions are slightly more restrictive than necessary&#13;
for the simple model. We could have assumed that the Harris-Todaro model&#13;
works as in case 4 in Section 4.4, and that the pool of urban unemployed&#13;
remains constant in which case the estimate of the social cost of a worker&#13;
drawn into the formal sector is analytically equivalent to the one&#13;
presented above.&#13;

remaining workers increasing their hours of work or from drawing new&#13;
participants -- wives and children, for example -- into the rural labor force.&#13;
The general formula for the social cost of labor drawn into the&#13;
formal sector from agriculture was given in Section 4:2&#13;
SWR   = M  + C   - B                                                   (a)&#13;
af    a     a    a&#13;
In this case, however, the elements of the shadow wage themselves consist of&#13;
two components, the direct costs and benefits arising from the movement of&#13;
workers dQ = QlQl plus the indirect costs and benefits of changes in&#13;
output and effort in the rural labor market as a result of the rise in wages.&#13;
We introduce the following notation to supplement that of Section 4.4:&#13;
dQd =   The decline in demand for agricultural workers&#13;
remaining in the rural sector as a result of the&#13;
rise in wages, e.g., QlQl in Figure A.&#13;
dQ  =   The increase in the supply of effort from workers&#13;
remaining in the agricultural sector, e.g.,&#13;
dW      The rise in the market wage of agricultural labor&#13;
resulting from the bidding up of wages in the&#13;
sector, e.g., W W.&#13;
a a&#13;
We shall further assume that only the incomes of heads of households&#13;
are affected by a change in occupation or wages. Thus, we derive expressions&#13;
for each element of the shadow wage. If agricultural workers are paid the&#13;
value of their marginal product at market prices, the market value of the&#13;
decline in output is given by the decline in demand for agricultural labor&#13;
multiplied by the wage in the pre-project equilibrium.&#13;
W dQd = Ql- dW   na                                                    (b)&#13;

The social valuation of the loss in output is, therefore:&#13;

The increase in effort on the part of workers remaining in the&#13;
agricultural sector increases their disposable incomes by:&#13;

The increase in disposable incomes of workers transferring from agricultural&#13;
employment to formal sector employment is:&#13;
dQp(Wf - Wa)                                                           (h)&#13;
and the social cost of providing the resources to meet this increase in&#13;
1/  fyr is the conversion factor applicable to marginal increases in rural&#13;
incomes (cfcr + sf5). Because the conversion ratios for rural and&#13;
urban consumption are nearly identical we use this also to apply to&#13;
incomes of agriculturalists moving to urban formal sector employment.&#13;

Finally, we consider the benefits arising from the increases in&#13;
income. We assume that the increase in income of workers in the agricultural&#13;
sector exactly compensates them for the disutility of increased effort, and&#13;
thus there is no net benefit accruing from the rise in disposable income as a&#13;
result of increased effort. The rise in wages, however, also introduces a&#13;
transfer of income from employers of agricultural labor and, perhaps,&#13;
ultimately from consumers of their products to workers in the agricultural&#13;
sector. The value at market prices of this transfer of income is:&#13;
Ql. dW                                                               (j)&#13;

where baw and bae are the welfare weights given to marginal changes in the&#13;
income of agricultural workers and employers (or consumers of agricultural&#13;
output) respectively. These weights are determined in the manner described in&#13;
Section 3.7.&#13;
The social valuation placed on the gain in income to workers drawn&#13;
from agriculture into formal sector employment is determined in the manner set&#13;
out in Section 4.4 for non-marginal changes in income. It may be represented&#13;
here as:&#13;
dQ (W  - W)b                                                         (l)&#13;
p  f    a  af&#13;
where baf is the weight determined on the basis of the formula for&#13;
non-marginal changes in income for typical agricultural workers transferring&#13;
from the agricultural to the formal sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197 -&#13;
The complete expression for the social cost of transferring workers&#13;
dQ   from agriculture into formal sector employment is given by:&#13;
Q dW  nafa + dQ (W f-W a)fyr + Q *dW *g. fyr&#13;

p  f  a    af     a    ae  aw&#13;
rearranging terms and noting that QdW = dQ W/(n      + g ) we derive:&#13;
dQp(wf-WaXf yrf fb    baf)&#13;
dQ W (n f   + gf       (b    - b))                            (n)&#13;
+ -p a    a a     ayT     *aw     ae&#13;
(n  + g&#13;
a    a&#13;
setting dQp = 1, the shadow wage rate for workers drawn from agriculture&#13;
when wages are bid up is:&#13;
SWR   = (W -W )(f    -b  )&#13;
af      f  a   yr  af&#13;

(nr  + g )&#13;
a     a&#13;
Ignoring the effect of rises in agricultural wages in Chapter 4&#13;
allowed us to employ a much simpler version of the shadow wage rate. Because&#13;
we were able to assume that the market value of the fall in output was equal&#13;
to dQ W,a and because there were no indirect effects on the rural labor&#13;
market, the simplified form of the shadow wage was given by:&#13;
NWR   = W= f  + (W -W )(f   -b   )                                       (p)&#13;

Under what circumstances will the two measures approximately coincide and what&#13;
are the biases introduced into the estimates of the shadow wage by use of the&#13;
simplified form in Chapter 4? If wages are in fact bid up, we define the bias&#13;
as:&#13;
afR    SWR    Waf   _ Wanafa    _gafya f  (b   -b    ))               (q)&#13;
afa +g)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
The formula in Chapter 4, SWR fl will equal the true shadow wage in the&#13;
presence of a rise in agricultural wages, if the elasticity of the supply of&#13;
effort in the agricultural sector is zero, and the net benefit from the&#13;
transfer of income from employers to employees (b     -b  ) is also zero.   It&#13;
does not seem unreasonable to assume that for marginal changes in agricultural&#13;
employment and wages the supply curve of labor services is highly inelastic.&#13;
Increases in effort are limited by available working hours and by preferences&#13;
for other activities. It is commonly argued that subsistance farmers exhibit&#13;
a marked preference for leisure, and while it is beyond the scope of the&#13;
present paper to review the literature on labor supply response in traditional&#13;
agriculture low or zero elasticities of supply are not inconsistent with the&#13;
models presented. 1/&#13;
It is interesting to note that the case of a backward bending supply&#13;
curve of labor can also be handled within the general framework for the shadow&#13;
wage presented. In this case, which has been widely discussed in the&#13;
literature on the supply of effort in peasant agriculture, the elasticity of&#13;
supply of labor is negative. Reference to the general formula SWR f&#13;
indicates that in such a case the indirect effect resulting frm the bidding up&#13;
of wages will involve a fall in output greater than the value W dQ at&#13;
market prices. Set against this will be a decline in the resources needed to&#13;
1/ See for example, the contributions by C. Nakajima and J. W. Mellor in&#13;
C. R. Wharton, Jr., Subsistence Agriculture and Economic Development&#13;
(London, Frank Cass, 1970). In the simplest case of all labor in wage&#13;
employment and a utility function in labor income and leisure, the shape&#13;
of the supply curve for agricultural labor depends on the nature of&#13;
preferences of workers. If both income and leisure are normal goods a&#13;
completely price inelastic supply curve of labor can be obtained without&#13;
extreme assumptions regarding the shape of individual preference maps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 199 -&#13;
support the consumption and savings of the rural labor force. The net result&#13;
will in general be that given a backward bending supply curve of labor the&#13;
shadow wage rate will exceed that for forward falling supply curves.&#13;
Note also that as the elasticity of supply approaches infinity the&#13;
estimated bias approaches W f -W f , regardless of the elasticity of&#13;
a a a yr&#13;
labor demand. This is because the increase in effort by remaining workers&#13;
offsets the decline in output caused by removing one worker from the&#13;
agricultural sector, but at a cost in terms of the additional resources needed&#13;
to provide for the extra consumption of those remaining. If the accounting&#13;
ratios for agricultural output and for consumption by agriculturalists are&#13;
approximately equal, as they are in Egypt, the simplified formula for the&#13;
shadow wage which we have used in Chapter 4 is quite a good estimate of the&#13;
social opportunity cost of labor.&#13;
In order for b    to equal ba  the incomes per capita in the&#13;
household of employers and employees must be approximately equal. 1/ To the&#13;
extent that the transfer of income is from farmers in their capacity as&#13;
employers to farmers and their families in their capacity as workers the&#13;
social benefit is nil. Not all of the agricultural labor force is&#13;
self-employed, however, and if on average workers are less well off than their&#13;
employers this portion of the transfer of income will represent a net social&#13;
1/ The manner in which welfare weights are derived from information on income&#13;
per capita is presented in Section 3.7. It should also be noted that if&#13;
the rise in wages were passed wholly on to the consumers of agricultural&#13;
products the transfer of income would be from consumer to workers. Because&#13;
prices for many Egyptian agricultural commodities are administratively&#13;
set, this was not felt to be a major consideration. To the extent that&#13;
the rise is passed on in higher prices the transfer of income will&#13;
increase the benefit somewhat more than the case presented in the text.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 200 -&#13;
benefit. Data on wage employment in agriculture are severely limited. In&#13;
Chapter 4 we arrived at an estimate of the average share of the rural labor&#13;
force in wage employment in agriculture of 15 percent. If we further assume&#13;
that all agricultural laborers belong to the LE 150-199 income class in Table&#13;
3-15 and that employers belong to all households taken at random, the benefit&#13;
resulting from the transfer of income will be equal to&#13;
Wa (2.33-1.87)(.150)/ ri, for an elasticity of the marginal valuation of&#13;
income of one. Thus, for elasticities of demand for agricultural labor equal&#13;
to one or greater than one, the benefit arising from the transfer of income&#13;
will be less than 7 percent of the agricultural wage.&#13;
Table A4-1 presents a sensitivity analysis of the estimated bias in&#13;
the shadow wage caused by our failure to consider the possibility of bidding&#13;
up of agricultural wages. Parameter values underlying the table reflect&#13;
estimates in Chapter 4 of the agricultural wage, the conversion ratios for&#13;
agricultural output and consumption, and the marginal benefits assigned to the&#13;
income transfer. The values in the table are the percentage by which the&#13;
estimate of the social accounting cost of labor drawn from agriculture in&#13;
Chapter 4 of LE 127 at accounting prices exceeds the true social opportunity&#13;
cost when wages are bid up. To interpret the table consider two extreme&#13;
cases. If the elasticity of labor supply is zero, the estimated resource cost&#13;
in Chapter 4 results in an overstatement of the social cost of labor obtained&#13;
from the agricultural sector of about 7 percent due to the welfare benefit of&#13;
the transfer (recall that the increased cost of consumption by workers is&#13;
precisely offset by the reduced consumption of employers). In the other&#13;
extreme, if the elasticity of the supply of effort is infinite the estimated&#13;
resource cost also overstates the opportunity cost, but only by about 10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 201 -&#13;
percent. This is because, althought there is no decline in output, additional&#13;
resources are required to provide for the increased consumption of the&#13;
remaining workers in agriculture.&#13;
If we take as our best guess that the estimated resource cost of the&#13;
marginal worker drawn from agriculture overstates true opportunity cost by 65&#13;
percent, this implies that our estimates of shadow wages at social accounting&#13;
prices overstate the true opportunity cost of labor by between 5-7 percent&#13;
depending on the weighting scheme used. This is well within the confidence&#13;
interval around our point estimate of the shadow wage.&#13;

            This paper presents estimates of
            efficiency and social accounting prices for commodities and
            factors of production in Egypt which are appropriate for the
            period 1979-1985. Shadow price estimates for commodities are
            based on a modified input-output method which decomposes
            domestic supply prices into foreign exchange and primary
            factor content. Shadow prices may differ from prices
            observed in the market because of non-competitive behavior,
            externalities, and distortions introduced by government
            policy. In Egypt, as in many developing economices, policy
            induced distortions are perhaps the most pervasive and at
            the same time the most complex cause of divergence between
            market and shadow prices. In these circumstances market
            signals may provide an inadequate guide for investment
            planning and project appraisal, and the need for a
            consistent set of prices which reflect the resource costs
            and social benefits of a proposed course of action becomes
            apparent. Particular attention has also been given to
            modeling of the market for skilled and unskilled labor in
            the formal sector and to determination of the shadow wage.
