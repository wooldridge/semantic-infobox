            Market power : airports
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the late 1980s and the 1990s many
            countries privatized airports or concessioned their
            operation. The United Kingdom began the trend, followed by
            other countries adopting new forms of infrastructure
            ownership and management. To control infrastructure
            licensing and the "natural monopoly"
            characteristics of some airport services, governments
            developed regulatory policies for airport systems. The
            operation of an airport creates incentives to transfer the
            airport's market power to the air transport market. If
            the airport market is regulated but the airport operator is
            allowed to control at least one airline, those incentives
            can give rise to anticompetitive practices aimed at
            displacing competing airlines. When the regulatory framework
            for airports lacks explicit rules about such vertical
            integration, that can have consequences for competition in
            the air transport market. Australia and Chile, for example,
            have an explicit prohibition on vertical integration. By
            contrast, Argentina has no restrictions on vertical
            integration leaving it to the antitrust agency to decide
            whether to approve or reject a vertical merger. Airlines
            provide air transport services by combining aircraft,
            personnel, airport services, and other inputs. Airports
            supply a series of services to air transport companies and
            to passengers. Aeronautical services (rescue, security,
            firefighting, infrastructure supply, runway and taxiway
            maintenance). Aeronautical-related commercial services
            (catering; supply of fuel and lubricants; baggage,
            passenger, and aircraft assistance). Commercial services
            (banks, hotels, restaurants, car rental, car parking, retail
            shops, duty-free shops).
