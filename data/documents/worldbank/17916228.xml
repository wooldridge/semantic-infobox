                  MR. McNAMARA:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                  And now we'll turn to the next item on the agenda,&#13;
&#13;
                                                                for&#13;
         a proposed loan in the amount of $1.8 million to Gabon&#13;
&#13;
         an education project.    Mr. Ba of the African Department will&#13;
&#13;
         introduce it to you.&#13;
&#13;
                   Mr.   Ba.&#13;
&#13;
                   MR. BA:     Mr Chairman, Members of the Board:&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                  The proposed $1.8 million loan to Gabon for&#13;
&#13;
        education development is a small one compared to the loans&#13;
&#13;
        already granted to Gabon or under consideration, but&#13;
&#13;
        despite its small size, we consider it to be just as important&#13;
&#13;
        as the larger ones.   The amount of money involved is not the&#13;
&#13;
        governing feature of this project.   Its greater effect&#13;
&#13;
        will be found, as we expect, in the technical skills and the&#13;
&#13;
        expertise which it will progressively make available to the&#13;
&#13;
        economy during the years to come.&#13;
&#13;
                  In financial terms, most of the public investment&#13;
&#13;
        program of Gabon has been focussed on transport and&#13;
&#13;
        communications which are among the main factors in the&#13;
&#13;
        development of the country, with the private sector investing&#13;
&#13;
        in mining and timber.   However, the success of these schemes&#13;
&#13;
        will depend on the availability of skilled manpower or trainable&#13;
&#13;
        manpower produced by the education system in Gabon.     The&#13;
&#13;
        educational and skill levels of the population are low:       only&#13;
&#13;
         400 Gabonese students were in post-secondary schools in 1967.&#13;
&#13;
        Almost 90% of the 2,000 high- and middle-level posts of the&#13;
&#13;
         labor force are now occupied by non-Gabonese.&#13;
&#13;
                   The initial big drive for expansion in primary&#13;
&#13;
         education had an adverse effect on academic standards and the&#13;
&#13;
         balanced growth of the system.   Schools became overcrowded,&#13;
&#13;
         furniture and equipment supplies inadequate, and sub-standard&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    10&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        teachers had to be recruited.   The government's present&#13;
&#13;
        plans for the educatiMxsector call for remedying some of&#13;
&#13;
        the shortcomings and imbalances,and for developing national manEower&#13;
&#13;
        resources so that Gabonese can gradually assume wider responsi-&#13;
&#13;
        bilities and functions.&#13;
&#13;
                  This policy has focussed attention on secondary&#13;
&#13;
        education as the supplier of skilled manpower.     Present plans,&#13;
&#13;
        therefore, aim at expansion and improvement of the secondary&#13;
&#13;
        education system, including traifiing in agricultural, technical&#13;
&#13;
        and commercial subjects.    It is within this framework that the&#13;
&#13;
        present Bank project has taken shape.    It will assist the&#13;
&#13;
        first phase of reforms to provide better teachers and rained&#13;
&#13;
        manpower and will help to facilitate the further modernization&#13;
&#13;
        of the Gabonese education system.&#13;
&#13;
                  Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. McNAMARA:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                  Are there questions or comments on this item?&#13;
&#13;
                  Mr. Merchant.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. MERCHANT:    One question, Mr.   Chairman.   To the&#13;
&#13;
        best of my belief, I think this is the first time a Bank&#13;
&#13;
        loan has provided, in the educational field, for the financing&#13;
&#13;
        of external fellowships or scholarships, and that without&#13;
&#13;
        criticizing that in any sense, I think this is a fine project&#13;
&#13;
        and I think quite clearly that the provision of these fellowshi3s&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       11&#13;
STRICTL   CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
          is essential to obtaining in time the indigenous teachers&#13;
&#13;
          corps, but I wondered, since it seems to be a frequent problem&#13;
&#13;
          with developing nations, I wondered whether there were any&#13;
&#13;
          understandings that the Government had or assurances that&#13;
&#13;
          might have been given the Bank as to the efforts to minimize&#13;
&#13;
          the loss of students who go to a university or technical&#13;
&#13;
          school abroad, and then fail to return to the country of their&#13;
&#13;
          origin, and I wondered if the ones who would be the recipients&#13;
&#13;
          of these fellowships, for example, would be under teaching&#13;
&#13;
          contracts to the Government, to some other undertaking or&#13;
&#13;
          understanding to minimize the risk of their loss to the&#13;
&#13;
          country, once they're educated?&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. McNAMARA:    I'll ask Mr. Ba to comment initially&#13;
&#13;
          and then perhaps Mr. Knapp or Mr. Chadenet would wish to&#13;
&#13;
          supplement it.&#13;
&#13;
                    Mr. Ba.&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. BA:     There's no formal agreement that the&#13;
&#13;
          Government will ask the students to come back, but generally&#13;
&#13;
          in the Gabon now they have all the students who have&#13;
&#13;
          fellowships hav6    d sign an agreement to serve ten years in     K&#13;
          the public schools.&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. McNAMARA: I think this is a fundamental point&#13;
&#13;
          and I quite agree with the implication of Mr. Merchant's&#13;
&#13;
                                                          by formal&#13;
          question, that we must assure ourselves, either&#13;
&#13;
           agreement between the Bank Group and recipient, or by&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLI CONFIDENTIAL                                            12&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        examination of contractual arrangements, as in this case,&#13;
&#13;
        between the recipient and the individuals, that they will&#13;
&#13;
        return when financed by us, to their nation to serve it&#13;
&#13;
        for a reasonable period, in this case ten years.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. MERCHANT:     Thank you, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. McNAMARA:     Are there other comments or questions?&#13;
&#13;
                  Yes, Mr. Knapp.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. KNAPP:    I thought perhaps I should comment that&#13;
&#13;
        actually, Mr.   Merchant, you say this is the first case,&#13;
&#13;
        but there have been quite a number of cases, particularly in the&#13;
&#13;
        education field, and we had a meeting of the Loan Committee&#13;
&#13;
        a couple of weeks ago, to review this as a matter of policy,&#13;
&#13;
        to review what we had done and how far it ought to be extended,&#13;
&#13;
        and what administrative arrangements ought to be made between&#13;
&#13;
        us and some other agencies to supervise these fellowships.&#13;
&#13;
        I think at an appropriate time, Mr. Chairman, we might bring&#13;
&#13;
        a paper to the Board on this subject.&#13;
&#13;
                  We have found that part of the answer of course&#13;
&#13;
        lies in providing expatriate personnel for local training, and&#13;
&#13;
        in a sense that's much more effective, reaches a much wider&#13;
&#13;
        group; and if you send people abroad, you have just this&#13;
&#13;
        problem you are speaking of, of which we're very conscious,&#13;
&#13;
        and I think at an appropriate time we will have a paper showing&#13;
&#13;
        how we propose to handle these problems.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       13&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. McNAMARA:      I suspect there will be considerable&#13;
&#13;
         discussion during the forthcoming year on the subject of&#13;
&#13;
         education, as you will see from the administrative budget,&#13;
&#13;
         which will be circulated to the Directors within the next&#13;
&#13;
         week.   We are planning a rather substantial expansion of our&#13;
&#13;
         activity in that field, particularly in the Projects Department,&#13;
&#13;
         hence in the initiation, appraisal, and examination of new&#13;
&#13;
         projects, and many of them will raise new problems of this&#13;
&#13;
         type.&#13;
&#13;
                    Are there other comments?&#13;
&#13;
                    Mr.   Malaplate.&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. MALAPLATE:     Mr. Chairman, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
         say briefly that I am supporting this loan.       This country&#13;
&#13;
         of about one-half the size of France has only one-hundredth&#13;
&#13;
         of the population, it has very large resources in uranium,&#13;
&#13;
         gold, gas, iron, wood, and has every kind of possibility&#13;
&#13;
         and I think that education is really one of the bottlenecks&#13;
&#13;
         and my Government is already helping in that field, and I&#13;
&#13;
         am happy that the Bank is going to help, too, in the field&#13;
&#13;
         of education.&#13;
&#13;
                    I have two small questions, one which concerns not&#13;
&#13;
         the report itself but the report on the economy of Gabon.&#13;
&#13;
         This report is dated May 15, 1968, but in paragraph 14,&#13;
&#13;
         page 4, there are some considerations of the political&#13;
&#13;
         situation in Gabon and although unfortunately President&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    14&#13;
STRICTLN CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
        Leon Mba I think about two months ago, or at least one month&#13;
&#13;
        ago, long before the date of the report, who is mentioned&#13;
&#13;
        as participating in the political life of the country, died,&#13;
&#13;
        which I think isn't right;    and the second question concerns&#13;
&#13;
        the report of the Statutory Committee which was very recently&#13;
&#13;
        distributed, and I think although the Statutory Report has&#13;
&#13;
        to be made, I wonder really what's the use of this report,&#13;
&#13;
        because it is made in such general terms it really does not&#13;
&#13;
        convey any new ideas in the report or on the usefulness&#13;
&#13;
        of the project, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. McNAMARA:    Mr. Knapp.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. KNAPP:   Well, the Statutory Committee is required&#13;
&#13;
        under the Articles to make the report, but I wouldn't want&#13;
&#13;
         to say it's just a sheer formality; we regard it as an importa t&#13;
&#13;
        document in which the senior officers of the Bank, joined&#13;
&#13;
         by a senior representative of the country, go on record as&#13;
&#13;
         endorsing the purposes of the project.     I would doubt&#13;
&#13;
         myself whether building it up into another document, which&#13;
&#13;
         would after all repeat all the things said in the report&#13;
&#13;
         and President's Report, would be useful, but it is for record&#13;
&#13;
                                                           provision&#13;
         purposes, I would say, and in satisfaction of the&#13;
&#13;
         in the Articles of Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
                   MR. McNAMARA:     Dr. Chen.&#13;
&#13;
                   DR. CHEN:   Thank you, Mr.    Chairman.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     15&#13;
STRICTL' CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                    While I support this loan, I have just one minor&#13;
&#13;
        question to ask in regard to the Appraisal Report on the&#13;
&#13;
        basic data of Gabon.     Under Population Growth, it is stated&#13;
&#13;
        it's    .6 percent per annum, which seems to me to be exceptionally&#13;
&#13;
        low for that part of the world, and I wonder whether it&#13;
&#13;
        could be a mistake.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McNAMARA:     Let me ask Mr. Ba to comment on it,&#13;
&#13;
        and then I may have a comment of my own, perhaps.&#13;
&#13;
                     The question is, is it correct to show the&#13;
&#13;
         rate of population growth in Gabon as      .6 percent.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. GERMANACOS:     It is correct, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McNAMARA:     You have confidence in the reliabilit&#13;
&#13;
         of their census statistics and associated data?&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. GERMANACOS: I believe the Economic Survey Report&#13;
&#13;
         also uses this figure.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McNAMARA:     Well, the point I'd make, Dr. Chen,&#13;
&#13;
                                                              of error&#13;
         is    iat I think we have, let's say, larger margins&#13;
                                                                 do in&#13;
         in some of our data relating to these countries than we&#13;
                                                              gather&#13;
         others, and we've noticed that recently in trying to&#13;
&#13;
         together statistics, and I noticed that particular percentage&#13;
&#13;
         here and would simply flag it as a question.&#13;
&#13;
                      But I think it is important, however, to have the&#13;
&#13;
         figure here.     What it really says is we don't believe there&#13;
                                                           I think we all&#13;
         is a population growth prdblem there, and on that&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                                     16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        igree.        Now,   whether it is   .6 or even 1.6, in any case it isn't&#13;
&#13;
        3.6,   and that's the major point to emphasize.&#13;
&#13;
                        Are there any other questions relating to this&#13;
&#13;
        ?roposed loan?          If not, perhaps Mr.   Kochman would care to&#13;
&#13;
           iomment.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. KOCHMAN: Mr. Chairman, I wish to express on&#13;
&#13;
        behalf of the Government of Gabon our deep appreciation for&#13;
&#13;
         he efficient handling of this project by the staff and&#13;
&#13;
        officers of the Bank.            It is also my pleasure to thank very&#13;
&#13;
        warmly my colleagues for approving this loan and to congratulate&#13;
&#13;
        you, Mr.       Chairman, for presenting this proposal to our Board.&#13;
&#13;
                         Finally, I would like to avail myself of this&#13;
&#13;
        opportunity to say how glad I am to see that this project&#13;
&#13;
        has been presented to our Board with eloquence and competence&#13;
&#13;
        by an African staff memb er.&#13;
&#13;
                         Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. McNAMARA:     I share in that feeling, Mr. Kochman.&#13;
&#13;
        Thank you very much, sir, and it will therefore be approved.&#13;
