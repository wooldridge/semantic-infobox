DISEASE CONTROL AND HEALTH DEVELOPMENT&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The development prospects of Cambodia are strongly shaped by three constraints: poorly&#13;
developed official institutions and services as a result of 20 years of war and international&#13;
isolation; a depleted human resource base due to the destructive policies of the Khmer Rouge&#13;
government in the 1970s; and a continuing rural insurgency that isolates certain areas of the&#13;
country and distorts government expenditures. These constraints are balanced by long term&#13;
development potential based on valuable assets: abundant mineral and forest resources,&#13;
compelling tourist attractions, extensive arable land, and trade and investment opportunities with&#13;
the dynamic economies on its borders. The Government's development objectives are structured&#13;
to address the above constraints in the near term and in the longer term to expand the productive&#13;
sustainable use of the country's considerable assets and endowments. The project would address&#13;
a key aspect of human resource development: improving the controi of three communicable&#13;
diseases and rehabilitating primary health care services.&#13;
1.2   Health conditions in the country are particularly unfavorable; mortality levels from easily&#13;
preventable diseases rival the highest rates in the world. Over half of Cambodia's population&#13;
carries the TB bacillus, and from this pool of infection, an estimated 35-40,000 active cases of&#13;
TB are prevalent each year, making TB a leading cause of death among young adults. Malaria is&#13;
also a leading killer, causing up to 5,000 deaths a year out of 500,000 probable cases, and with&#13;
drug resistance a major problem for treatment strategies. HIV/AIDS has grown geometrically&#13;
each year into an epidemic, with risk groups reporting up to 40 percent sero-positivity for HIV.&#13;
The primary health care system is poorly developed to manage and deliver the services that could&#13;
have an impact on these and other preventive and communicable diseases.&#13;
1.3   The Disease Control and Health Development Project (CDCP) will help finance a&#13;
focused five year effort to assist the Government in the reconstruction and expansion of&#13;
Cambodia's health system with particular attention paid to reducing death and sickness from&#13;
three leading communicable diseases: tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS. Tuberculosis and&#13;
malaria control efforts will be expanded and improved and the rapidly expanding HIV/AIDS&#13;
epidemic will be checked through a range of preventive measures focusing on blood safety,&#13;
information and behavioral change. To ensure the effectiveness of these programs and other&#13;
primary health care interventions, the project will also help rehabilitate the long neglected public&#13;
health services and establish modern management techniques focused on objectives and&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. THE SECTOR&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
Health Situation&#13;
2.1    Health conditions in Cambodia are extremely poor and have barely improved over the&#13;
last twenty years, due to the virtual dismantling of the health system during the 1970s and overall&#13;
lack of investment in the health system since then. Data on the health situation is limited,&#13;
however, it is known that Cambodia suffers from a very high burden of mortality from&#13;
preventable and curable diseases. An estimated 115 out of every 1,000 infants under the age of&#13;
one die-nearly three times the regional infant mortality rate of 42 per 1,000 live births -- while&#13;
the under-five mortality rate is 181 per 1,000 live births as compared to the regional rate of 56&#13;
per 1,000 -- with acute respiratory infections, diarrhea and malaria being the leading causes of&#13;
childhood mortality. Maternal health is little better -- the maternal mortality ratio estimated at&#13;
900 per 100,000 births is the highest in East Asia. Tuberculosis and malaria are widespread and&#13;
are leading causes of death, and HIV/AIDS is rapidly reaching epidemic proportions.&#13;
2.2    Tuberculosis. Cambodia harbors some of the highest rates of TB in the world, with&#13;
active TB cases reported to be over 800 per 100,000 population in some areas. Over half the&#13;
population is infected with the TB bacillus, and from this pool of infection, 35-40,000 active&#13;
cases exist at any one time, making TB a leading killer of young adults and a significant threat to&#13;
children.&#13;
2.3   Even with increased disease control efforts, a decrease in the number of active TB cases&#13;
may not be realized for many years. Rather, over the next five years, Cambodia is likely to see&#13;
an increase in the number of TB patients due to the effects of HIV infection, which dramatically&#13;
increases the risk of developing TB; the increased availability and capacity of medical staff to&#13;
diagnose TB; and the increased reliability and quality of TB treatment attracting a greater&#13;
number of patients. In order to decrease the prevalence of TB in the population and reduce the&#13;
number of new cases over a five to ten year time frame, about 70 percent of active cases (24,000&#13;
cases) will need to be treated each year, a 50 percent increase over the number of cases treated in&#13;
1994 and 1995.&#13;
2.4   Malaria. Malaria is a major cause of illness and death in Cambodia, with 100,000&#13;
laboratory confirmed cases and 1,100 recorded deaths in 1994. The real figures may be up to&#13;
five times higher, with the overall case fatality rate estimated at about 1 percent, and rising to&#13;
over 10 percent, in some malaria-prone districts.&#13;
2.5    An estimated 17 percent of the country's population live in areas where there is a high&#13;
risk of malaria transmission. These high risk areas are the forested areas and rubber plantations&#13;
towards the borders of the country. The densely populated central and south-eastern rice&#13;
growing areas, along the Tonle Sap River, are low risk areas for malaria. However, there is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
large transient population, mainly made up of young men, who venture into the forests to make a&#13;
living, thereby increasing the population at high risk of malaria infection.&#13;
2.6   Drug resistant malaria is a rising problem in Cambodia. About 80 percent of the malaria&#13;
infections are caused by Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which has developed a high level of&#13;
drug resistance, especially in the western provinces. An additional problem is that many people&#13;
rely on drugs bought in the marketplace to treat malaria, sometimes spending more than US$100&#13;
on inappropriate and dangerous medicines. Such inappropriate treatment is thought to be a major&#13;
factor behind the high case fatality rates among malaria victims in Cambodia.&#13;
2.7   HIV/AIDS. Compared globally, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) emerged late&#13;
in Cambodia. First detected in 1991, the virus continues a relentless spread in the community,&#13;
and the country faces, potentially, the worst HIV epidemic in Asia. The rate of increase of HIV&#13;
prevalence among blood donors is phenomenal and alarming, rising in Phnom Penh from 0.075&#13;
percent in 1991 to 8 percent in October 1995. Figures of HIV prevalence in mid-1995 derived&#13;
from surveillance activities are similarly of concern. Not surprisingly, prostitutes show the&#13;
highest infection rates, ranging up to 40 percent of those tested in Battambang. Especially&#13;
disturbing is the number of pregnant women found HIV-positive, over 4 percent in Siem Reap&#13;
and Sihanoukville. The military and police are increasingly infected, with around 10 percent of&#13;
the force tested being HIV-positive in some locations, and patients with sexually transmitted&#13;
diseases (STDs) in Phnom Penh showing similar levels of infection in a 1994 survey. Among&#13;
tuberculosis patients in 1995, between 20 and 31 percent were HIV-positive.&#13;
2.8   From the available epidemiological data, the virus appears to be relatively evenly spread&#13;
across the main urban centers. The epidemic is mainly sexually transmitted and of those&#13;
identified with HIV, about 75 percent are men. An assessment of intravenous drug use&#13;
conducted by the World Bank in November 1995 revealed little evidence of such practices&#13;
despite the high volume of drug trafficking in the region. However, there were early indications&#13;
that the situation may be changing. Indiscriminate use of needles for injections by providers of&#13;
medical care is clearly a threat and may have contributed to the rapid rise of HIV prevalence.&#13;
The Health System&#13;
2.9  In theory, the public health system in Cambodia consists of a clinic in each commune, a&#13;
referral hospital in each district capital, and a provincial hospital in each provincial capital. In&#13;
reality, most clinics are non-existent or virtually non-functioning at the commune level, with&#13;
poorly motivated staff offering very limited services. Few of the district hospitals offer referral&#13;
services. Instead they function more like clinics offering an outpatient clinic, mother and child&#13;
health care, vaccinations and limited in-patient care for TB patients. Medical, surgical and&#13;
obstetrical emergencies can only be treated in provincial hospitals, in national hospitals, and in a&#13;
limited number of district hospitals. Overall, existing services are heavily biased in favor of&#13;
Phnom Penh and the provincial capitals, with only 13 percent of the Ministry of Health (MOH)&#13;
workforce employed in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.10   Where services are available, their quality is often poor and utilization of existing&#13;
facilities low. Reasons for this include the poor state of facilities, inadequate equipment and&#13;
drug supplies, the lack of quality and relevant training for health workers, and the low level of&#13;
staff salaries leading to widespread informal fee charging for drugs and services by public health&#13;
workers. The high maternal mortality ratio in Cambodia is to a large extent due to the lack of&#13;
qualified surgeons/obstetricians in the country. Where donors have helped upgrade the clinical&#13;
skills of the staff, ensured a reliable drug supply, and rehabilitated the facilities, utilization has&#13;
increased dramatically, pointing to the large unmet demand for quality modem health services.&#13;
2.11   Up until 1993, the public health system was decentralized, and the provincial authorities&#13;
were relatively autonomous in the management and financing of health services. This resulted in&#13;
a weak central level and a large variation in terms of resource allocation and the quality of health&#13;
care among the different provinces. Since 1993, the Ministry of Health, with the support of&#13;
advisors from WHO and UNICEF, has endeavored to develop policies and plans to restructure&#13;
and rationalize the health system. This resulted in the publication of the "National Health&#13;
Development Plan 1994-1996" which redefines the institutional framework for the health system&#13;
and the services offered at each level, in an aim to rationalize the use of resources. The focus of&#13;
the plan is the development of the district health system to deliver essential primary health care&#13;
to meet communities' basic health needs.&#13;
2.12   The reform of the health system implies a revision of the expected roles of each level of&#13;
care as well as a revision of infrastructure coverage in accordance with population distribution,&#13;
not administrative divisions, as before. Under the Health Plan, the health system is to be&#13;
organized into three levels:&#13;
(a)    Peripheral level (or "operational district"), made up of health centers and district&#13;
referral hospitals.  Health centers will be the point of first contact for the&#13;
population and would provide a minimum package of services (public health and&#13;
minor curative) for a 10,000 person catchment area. Referral hospitals will offer&#13;
first referral support to the health centers and provide a complementary package&#13;
of public health and essential clinical services.&#13;
(b)   Intermediate level consisting of provincial directorates, hospitals and health&#13;
institutions in the province. The Provincial Health Directorate is the link between&#13;
the MOH and the operational districts. Provincial hospitals will act as referral&#13;
hospitals for the district in which they are situated and will offer a number of&#13;
specialized services that are not provided by the district hospitals.&#13;
(c)    Central level consisting of the MOH, national institutes, national programs and&#13;
national hospitals.&#13;
2.13   Health coverage plans are being developed at the provincial level, in consultation with&#13;
local authorities and communities, to define clearly the location of district-level health facilities,&#13;
the services offered and their catchment areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.14  As part of the Health Plan the national disease control programs are to be strengthened,&#13;
including those for TB, malaria and AIDS. In the past, these programs have been run as vertical&#13;
programs with management and reporting structures separate from the general health system.&#13;
However, they are now in the process of being integrated with the other health care services&#13;
provided at the district and provincial level, and the capacity within the MOH to play a more&#13;
active role in their management and evaluation is being developed.&#13;
2.15 National Tuberculosis Program (NTP). The NTP was established in 1980 under the&#13;
management authority of the National Anti-Tuberculosis Center (CENAT) based in Phnom&#13;
Penh. CENAT has responsibility for managing and supervising TB control activities, including&#13;
the definition of drug requirements and equipment for TB diagnosis and treatment and training&#13;
provincial and district-level health workers in diagnosis and patient care. In 1993, a National&#13;
Tuberculosis Control Plan was completed with the assistance of WHO. It sets out objectives and&#13;
targets for the program. The main targets are to increase the case detection rate from 30 percent&#13;
to 70 percent and the cure rate to 85 percent by the year 2000. As of late 1995, the NTP had&#13;
covered over half of all public hospitals with its new short-course therapy procedures, drugs and&#13;
training.&#13;
2.16  Treatment for TB is generally administered on an in-patient basis (directly observed&#13;
treatment) for the first two to three months. Food supplements are provided to patients on a daily&#13;
basis while in the hospital, and on a monthly basis during the follow-up ambulatory phase. This&#13;
food program, mostly financed by the World Food Program until now, encourages patients to&#13;
remain in hospital for intensive treatment and acts as an incentive for completing their therapy as&#13;
an out-patient.&#13;
2.17 National Malaria Program (NMP). The NMP, also established in 1980, is managed at&#13;
the central level by the National Malaria Center (CNM). As with the tuberculosis program,&#13;
malaria treatment activities are undertaken primarily by provincial and district level health&#13;
workers, with CNM providing technical supervision, training and support. Malaria vector&#13;
control activities, including impregnated bednet supervision, is coordinated by CNM at the&#13;
central level.&#13;
2.18  The primary objective of the NMP is to reduce malaria mortality and morbidity, with a&#13;
target of supplying all central, provincial and district hospitals with sufficient antimalarial drugs&#13;
effective for their area and achieving less than 2 percent hospital mortality from malaria by the&#13;
year 2000. A three-fold strategy has been developed to achieve this: first, improve the access to&#13;
early, accurate diagnosis and prompt, effective treatment; second, increase the use of preventive&#13;
measures, particularly impregnated bednets; and third, develop community understanding of the&#13;
prevention and recognition of the disease and its rational treatment. The second objective of the&#13;
NMP is to develop the institutional capacity to control vector borne diseases through improved&#13;
management, training and research.&#13;
2.19 National AIDS Program. Given the relatively recent incidence of AIDS in Cambodia,&#13;
the national program for its prevention and control is relatively undeveloped. The response to&#13;
the epidemic has been largely driven by external concern and support through WHO, UNDP and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
the international NGO community. This has been critical in assisting the Government to focus&#13;
on the issue and organize a response. A National AIDS Committee, chaired by the Minister of&#13;
Health, was formed in 1992 to provide a multisectoral response to the epidemic. In 1993, a&#13;
National AIDS Office (NAO) was established, located within the Ministry of Health. Staffed by&#13;
six professionals, all doctors, the office manages the national program and acts as a de facto&#13;
secretariat for the recently renamed National STD and AIDS Control Committee.&#13;
2.20  Despite the establishment of the NAO, there is still scant intersectoral coordination and&#13;
limited program effort on HIV/AIDS. The NAO has insufficient resources, both human and&#13;
financial, to be able to conduct a program on the scale needed if the epidemic is to be slowed. To&#13;
date, NAO has relied on financing from the WHO/GPA (Global Program on AIDS), which is&#13;
expected to stop at the end of 1995. The termination of WHO/GPA financing creates uncertainty&#13;
and a loss of resources for NAO, which in 1996 and 1997 only has commitments of&#13;
US$150,000/year from UNAIDS and an uncertain future government allocation. Given the&#13;
limited resources for the national program, in effect, most HIV/AIDS activities are supported by&#13;
NGOs. Particularly successful NGO programs include the social marketing of condoms, which&#13;
has expanded the market for safe, reliable condoms. Recently, with the increasing need to take&#13;
action on the HIV issue, the spotlight has been cast on high risk behaviors and how they could be&#13;
modified.&#13;
B. SECTORAL ISSUES&#13;
2.21  Low coverage and impact of public health programs. The public health system in&#13;
Cambodia was virtually dismantled during the 1970s, and today, aside from EPI, national public&#13;
health programs have yet to exert a sustained impact on disease and death from preventable and&#13;
communicable diseases. EPI has been operating for many years with sustained support from&#13;
UNICEF and WHO and is often the only public health service available to rural communities.&#13;
Similar sustained efforts are required to have the desired impact on malaria, TB and AIDS.&#13;
2.22  Low public spending on health services. Public budgets for health have historically&#13;
been very low in Cambodia, rising to about 49 billion riels (approx. US$20 million) or 0.7&#13;
percent of GDP in 1995. This is equivalent to less than US$2 per capita, far less than the US$12&#13;
per capita recommended for low income countries. Cost estimates by the MOH indicate that&#13;
US$5-6 per capita will be needed to provide a minimum package of services at commune clinic&#13;
and district hospital levels alone. The historically low levels of public expenditures for health is&#13;
compounded by the even lower share given to essential services. Currently, government&#13;
resources are dedicated heavily to the running costs of hospital services in Phnom Penh and&#13;
provincial and district facilities -- 50 percent of the government budget is spent on tertiary and&#13;
secondary hospitals. Very limited services are provided in TB, malaria and maternal and child&#13;
care, particularly at the commune level, where only 15 percent of the public health budget is&#13;
directed. The lack of public health services has meant that many people turn to the private sector&#13;
for medical care. The Socio-Economic Survey of Cambodia 1993-94 indicates that households&#13;
spend about US$22 a year per capita on health care, 7 percent of a household budget. These&#13;
expenditures are primarily for drugs purchased at pharmacies and local drug sellers. Often these&#13;
drugs are wrongly prescribed or administered and can worsen health problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
2.23  Inappropriate distribution of health system resources. The present composition of the&#13;
health care workforce and facilities and their distribution are not meeting the health care needs of&#13;
the Cambodian population. An estimated 25 percent of the rural population do not have access&#13;
to public health care. Health workers are poorly trained, poorly motivated and poorly paid.&#13;
Reform of the health system is needed with particular emphasis given to rationalizing and&#13;
improving the services of clinics and referral hospitals, and the managerial links between the&#13;
two. This need is well-recognized by the MOH and is addressed through their strategy of&#13;
developing provincial health coverage plans and an operational district-based health system. The&#13;
main challenge now is to finalize these plans and implement them. The issue of staff pay levels&#13;
is being addressed at the national level, through civil service reform. The MOH is a pilot&#13;
ministry for this effort, which has substantial donor support.&#13;
2.24 Weak management capacity. Management and supervisory linkages between the MOH&#13;
and the provinces are weak, in part because of the historical autonomy of the provincial level.&#13;
Responsibility and accountability between the center and intermediary and peripheral levels of&#13;
the health system are lacking. Few staff are trained in managerial techniques or in planning,&#13;
budgeting and supervision. Invariably, it has been the presence of NGO support or provincial&#13;
health advisors, financed by WHO and UNICEF, that have enabled management issues to be&#13;
dealt with, in spite of system deficiencies. Improving the responsiveness and accountability&#13;
between the Ministry of Health and the provincial and lower levels of the health system will&#13;
require reforming the "contractual" responsibilities of various parties in the public health system,&#13;
to increase the degree of accountability and expected performance of health care providers at all&#13;
levels.&#13;
C. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
2.25 Following a period of intense policy dialogue and assistance from external advisors, the&#13;
Ministry of Health has defined clear policies and service delivery strategies for the health sector.&#13;
The overall aim of the Government's National Health Policy is to "improve the health and well-&#13;
being of the Cambodian people by making full use of both public and private health care&#13;
systems, giving special attention to health education, preventative and curative health care for&#13;
people living in rural areas."&#13;
2.26 At the heart of the Government's strategy is the strengthening of a district-based health&#13;
care system through which a cost-effective but essential minimum package of primary and&#13;
preventive health services can be delivered to rural areas. Other priorities include reducing the&#13;
incidence of communicable diseases, in particular, priority diseases that account for most of the&#13;
burden of disease in Cambodia, including malaria, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases&#13;
and HIV; rehabilitating and upgrading the system infrastructure, including human resources, so&#13;
as to deliver health services more effectively down to the primary service level; ensuring an&#13;
adequate and secure supply of drugs throughout the health system; and ensuring the full&#13;
participation of both the public and private sectors in the delivery of health services, within&#13;
appropriate regulatory frameworks to raise service standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.27  Through a process of restructuring and investment, the Government aims to develop an&#13;
affordable and rational health service that meets the priority health needs of the population. The&#13;
strategy to attain this objective embraces four key principles: increase the direct links between&#13;
MOH and provincial and district systems on policy, budget and management matters; build-up&#13;
the relevant national disease control programs;- expand national budgetary support for the health&#13;
system; and more effectively coordinate donor support to fill identified gaps in financing. Thus,&#13;
malaria and TB control programs require a full range of facilities, equipment and drugs in&#13;
referral hospitals and health centers in order for these programs to be effective.&#13;
2.28 Donors are strongly supportive of the government's health plan and have assisted in its&#13;
development and implementation. In particular, UNICEF and WHO have been supporting local&#13;
service delivery (UNICEF finances provincial health advisors, immunization and essential drug&#13;
programs) and building policy and management capacities at the central MOH (WHO, ODA and&#13;
UNDP). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a Basic Health Services project in&#13;
five provinces, and has coordinated its plans closely with World Bank project preparation.&#13;
Together, the two projects will provide facility, equipment and essential drugs for 15 provinces&#13;
and 80 percent of the population. Overall, donor coordination is good, as is the integration of&#13;
NGO-supported activities into the government's program. NGOs have played an important role&#13;
in providing health services and training in Cambodia over the past five years. Over 70 NGOs&#13;
are active in the health sector, the majority running small-scale primary health care projects in&#13;
rural districts. Many of them have well-qualified and skilled staff and have helped establish&#13;
well-run health facilities. Their experience is likely to prove invaluable in implementing the&#13;
government's district-based health plan.&#13;
D. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
2.29 The Disease Control and Health Development Project (CDCP) has been designed to help&#13;
attain the Government's health sector objectives through financial and technical support of the&#13;
MOH's strategy. The objectives of the Project are consistent with IDA's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy for 1996-1997.&#13;
2.30 The choice among alternative interventions for project financing followed a four step&#13;
process: (i) the epidemiologic profile was assessed to determine leading causes of premature&#13;
mortality; (ii) those leading causes with clear public health characteristics (communicable&#13;
diseases that individuals would not adequately control using their private resources) were&#13;
selected as meriting public financing and project support (heart disease and injuries were ranked&#13;
much lower, for example); (iii) the availability of substantial donor support was estimated so as&#13;
to exclude well financed interventions (family planning and immunizations, for example); and&#13;
(iv) the cost-effectiveness ratios for the remaining interventions were obtained in the secondary&#13;
literature. This process led to the choice of three national disease control programs, namely TB,&#13;
malaria and HIV, all of which are cost-effective interventions, high priorities of the Government,&#13;
and are also underfinanced.&#13;
2.31  The treatment of TB by means of chemotherapy is ranked highly cost effective and is&#13;
considered a core public health intervention. Specifically, short course chemotherapy involving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
two month hospitalization has been estimated to cost US$3 per Disability Adjusted Life Year saved&#13;
(DALY'). Treatment of malaria, another comrmunicable threat to public health, is also justified on&#13;
cost effectiveness and public health grounds, although at higher cost (US$200 per DALY in areas&#13;
of high case fatality and endemicity, as is the case in Cambodia). HIV prevention activities have&#13;
been accorded the highest public health priority, especially in the early phases of the epidemic, as in&#13;
Cambodia. Spread of the disease from the "core" risk groups, such as prostitutes and soldiers, to&#13;
the general population involves a major escalation of the epidemic and of future lives lost. Market&#13;
failure in the control of such an epidemic is widely acknowledged. Moreover, the benefit of saving&#13;
those lives and of averting the high costs to the health system of treating AIDS patients constitutes&#13;
a compelling rationale on cost-effectiveness grounds for early and large scale preventive efforts.&#13;
The epidemic in Cambodia is in just such early stages. Treatment of HIV/AIDS on the other hand&#13;
2&#13;
is not considered highly cost-effective , thus narrowing the intervention choices to preventive&#13;
measures given current medical technologies.&#13;
2.32   Several key strategic choices were agreed with the Government in order to maximize&#13;
sustainability and the impact of project investments. First, the project has opted for a two track&#13;
approach of disease control and health system strengthening. A narrower focus on disease&#13;
control would be simpler to implement centrally, but would encounter capacity and&#13;
implementation constraints at the service delivery level. On the other hand, a health service&#13;
strengthening project alone (facilities, equipment, drugs, training) would inject large quantities of&#13;
inputs into health facilities, but with no clear disease control and public health objective or&#13;
impact. Disease control programs are in fact highly dependent on the integrated service delivery&#13;
structure at the provincial level and below. Given the unexpectedly rapid development of MOH&#13;
and provincial capacities, the project will support both tracks to ensure the success of the disease&#13;
control programs and to build capacities to deliver basic health services.&#13;
2.33 Second, during project design, an analysis of alternatives concerning "least cost" issues&#13;
within the broad disease control strategies was done. For example, distribution of insecticide-&#13;
treated bednets is considered a highly promising intervention to control the disease vector, and&#13;
experiments and pilots in Cambodia have shown impressive results in reducing transmission of&#13;
the disease. Bednet distribution is thus a replacement intervention for household residual&#13;
spraying, the cost-effectiveness of which has been called into question in recent work. To tailor&#13;
the bednet strategy to Cambodia and to identify least cost approaches, two studies were&#13;
undertaken and their results incorporated in the formulation of the bednet distribution strategy of&#13;
the National Malaria Program.&#13;
2.34   Similarly, in the case of TB control, a study on patient food supplements was conducted&#13;
to estimate more accurately the minimum level of such supplementation to assure high patient&#13;
compliance with the short course chemotherapy regimen. Although the project will not finance&#13;
such costs, an effective incentive program for patient compliance is vital to the success of the TB&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
control prograrn. Based on the study, the Government agreed to provide adequate resources to&#13;
this activity at current levels of supplementation in cooperation with the World Food Program.&#13;
2.35   Third, the project will emphasize several management reforms to establish accountability&#13;
for specific health outputs and ultimately outcomes. A MOH-provincial Health Management&#13;
Agreement, limited organizational restructuring at the provincial level, and a special fund to&#13;
support program supervision and management training will be supported by the project to&#13;
improve management practices and orient the system to performance and results.&#13;
2.36  Fourth, given that the current phase of development in Cambodia is one of reconstruction&#13;
and rehabilitation, the project will support the limited reconstruction and expansion of the&#13;
publicly subsidized health system, rather than attempt to restructure the health system or its&#13;
financing. Thus, the project will not seek to implement far-reaching reforms on personnel&#13;
compensation a major issue, as it is tied to wider civil service reform efforts now underway.&#13;
However, it will be structured to support cost recovery schemes both at health centers and in the&#13;
social marketing strategy for bednet distribution. The project will also develop private sector&#13;
capacities in specialized areas where the private sector can be expected to contribute to the public&#13;
health objectives. Social marketing of impregnated bednets through private sector channels will&#13;
be supported, as will NGO and other private sector initiatives in HIV/AIDS prevention and&#13;
outreach.&#13;
2.37  Fifth, the project is structured to finance public subsidies justified on a public&#13;
finance/public good rationale. The government and the Bank agreed at the outset that control of&#13;
communicable diseases is a fundamental priority for any government, and that basic principles of&#13;
public finance and epidemiology dictate a sharp focus on strengthening the capacities of the&#13;
government to exert an impact on the severe public health problems in malaria, TB, and HIV.&#13;
Thus the project will not support tertiary hospitals, sophisticated equipment used in the treatment&#13;
of non-communicable diseases, or training of highly specialized medical personnel.&#13;
2.38  Finally, the project has been costed based upon a programmatic approach. First, the&#13;
government assessed likely donor and budget flows to the three priority programs and made a&#13;
decision on which of its priorities merited ITF financing3. Costs were estimated based on the&#13;
total needs for the Government's public health programs in those project supported areas.&#13;
Available financing from the government and donors has been estimated for these same&#13;
programs, and financing gaps were then calculated. The ITF-assisted project is costed to fill&#13;
these gaps. Primary care priorities, such as maternal and child care, family planning,&#13;
immunizations and nutrition will be assisted indirectly by the health strengthening component,&#13;
and are also receiving considerable support from other donors.&#13;
3  The project will be financed by the Interim Trust Fund (ITF), and IDA will serve as administrator of the ITF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE&#13;
3.1   Project Objectives. The project aims to support the Government of Cambodia in&#13;
pursuing two of its principal health sector objectives: (i) reduce death and sickness from&#13;
preventable diseases, especially malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS; and (ii) rehabilitate the health&#13;
system infrastructure so as to deliver basic health services and disease control programs more&#13;
effectively down to the community level.&#13;
3.2   Project Scope.  To achieve these objectives the project will have the following&#13;
components:&#13;
(a)   National Program Support for the malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS control&#13;
programs, including provision of (i) drugs and laboratory supplies;&#13;
(ii) impregnated bednets; (iii) training; (iv) logistical support; and (v) technical&#13;
assistance in order to expand and increase the impact of these programs.&#13;
(b)   Basic Health Strengthening including investments in (i) the reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation of first and referral-level facilities; (ii) medical equipment and&#13;
furniture; (iii) essential drugs; (iv) in-service training; and (v) MOH&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Component I. National Program Support&#13;
(US$13.0 million equivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
3.3   The project would support three national health programs, namely malaria, tuberculosis&#13;
and HIV/AIDS. In all cases, ITF financing is being directed towards areas where available&#13;
financing from the Government and other donors falls short of projected needs. Since the project&#13;
will cover the estimated total financing gap of these national programs, the geographic coverage&#13;
of this component is effectively nationwide. The parallel ADB supported Basic Health Services&#13;
Project will provide the necessary health strengthening investments in five additional provinces,&#13;
thus enhancing the impact of the three disease control programs nationally.&#13;
National Tuberculosis Program (US$3.0 million equivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
3.4   The overall objective of this sub-component is to assist the NTP (see Annex 1) in its&#13;
efforts to reduce tuberculosis prevalence by sustaining (i) a yearly combined cure rate and&#13;
therapy completion rate of at least 85 percent, and (ii) a sustained yearly relapse rate of less than&#13;
5 percent. Specifically, the sub-component would: (a) improve the quality and accessibility of&#13;
tuberculosis services in health centers and referral hospitals, including case diagnosis and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
management; and (b) strengthen the institutional capacity of the National Anti-Tuberculosis&#13;
Center (CENAT), through improved management, training, and research.&#13;
3.5   The total financing base cost requirement for the NTP throughout the period 1996-2000 is&#13;
estimated to be US$9.3 million base cost. Other major financing for the program is expected&#13;
from the Government, WHO, JICA and the World Food Program (WFP). Under the project, the&#13;
following activities will be supported:&#13;
Disease Management&#13;
3.6   Improvements will be made to laboratories at referral hospitals and health centers with&#13;
TB ward facilities to increase the capability for and accuracy of TB diagnosis. Inputs would&#13;
consist of diagnostic equipment (primarily microscopes), reagents and supplies.  Where&#13;
laboratories are established in referral hospitals, the TB and malaria laboratory services will be&#13;
integrated. In full referral hospitals, radiology equipment and additional TB beds will be&#13;
supplied under Health Strengthening (Component II). TB drugs will also be supplied under&#13;
Component II.&#13;
Program Management&#13;
3.7   Support will be provided to CENAT in the form of (a) staff training including short&#13;
courses in drug treatment and program supervision and short-termn overseas courses; (b) technical&#13;
assistance; (c) office renovation and upgrading; (d) office equipment; and (e) vehicles for&#13;
provincial level supervision.&#13;
3.8   Three different training courses will be supported: the bi-annual NTP meeting with&#13;
approximately 100 participants; the short-course chemotherapy seminar conducted five times&#13;
each year with approximately 80 participants; and workshops conducted five times each year&#13;
with about 40 participants. In addition, the travel and per diem costs of CENAT staff traveling to&#13;
the provinces four times each year for training and supervision will be covered. International&#13;
training activities include participation in the meeting of the International Union Against&#13;
Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, usually held in Europe, the regional tuberculosis control&#13;
meetings (Thailand, Vietnam), and overseas courses in TB control and epidemiology.&#13;
3.9   Technical assistance will consist of a national program advisor and a laboratory advisor.&#13;
To date, these positions have been financed by WHO and JICA on a full-time basis. This&#13;
support is ending at the end of 1997, after which the project will support the cost on a-6 month&#13;
basis in 1998, and four months per year thereafter.&#13;
Evaluation and Research&#13;
3.10 Four types of epidemiologic survey will be financed: a national TB prevalence survey, a&#13;
tuberculin skin test survey every five years, a drug-resistance survey each year, and an HIV&#13;
infection survey among TB patients each year. Per diem costs and equipment are included in the&#13;
financing of the surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3.11  Food requirements for TB patients are included in the costs of the national program.&#13;
However, these costs will be financed by the Government and the WFP, not by ITF.&#13;
Malaria Control Program (US$3.5 million equivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
3.12  The overall objective of this component is to support the CNM in implementing the&#13;
National Malaria Program which aims to reduce malaria transmission and case mortality and&#13;
morbidity through a treatment and community-based preventive program (see Annex 2).&#13;
Specifically, the component would (i) improve the access to early, accurate diagnosis and&#13;
prompt, effective treatment of malaria; (ii) expand the community-level use of impregnated&#13;
mosquito nets in high and medium risk areas; (iii) support pilot testing of a social marketing&#13;
approach for impregnated mosquito nets; and (iv) increase the capacity of the CNM to manage,&#13;
supervise and monitor the program.&#13;
3.13  The total base cost financing for the NMP for the period 1996-2000 is estimated to be&#13;
US$11.9 million. Major financing for the program is expected from WHO, EU, ODA and&#13;
AusAID. The project will support the following activities:&#13;
Disease Management&#13;
3.14 Financing in the area of disease management will assist the CNM to expand diagnostic&#13;
and treatment services into more peripheral areas. Inputs include microscopes and laboratory&#13;
equipment for referral hospitals and selected health centers.  Where feasible, integrated&#13;
laboratories will be established which carry out TB and malaria diagnosis, as well as other&#13;
laboratory tests. The supply of laboratory equipment under the project has, therefore, been&#13;
rationalized to take into account existing stock and shared usage across programs. Anti-malarial&#13;
drugs will also be supplied and are budgeted under the Health Strengthening Component.&#13;
Vector Control&#13;
3.15  A key objective of the NMP is to expand and evaluate the use of insecticide-treated&#13;
mosquito nets, through both public channels and development of a social marketing strategy&#13;
implemented by the private sector and NGOs (see Annex 2). The project would support this&#13;
initiative by financing (a) mosquito nets, insecticide and basic equipment for net treatment (if not&#13;
funded by other donors); (b) vehicles (to be shared with other disease control programs);&#13;
(c) training; (d) IEC materials; (e) operations budget for implementation; and (f) operations&#13;
research in alternative, cost-effective personal protection methods, IEC strategies, cost recovery&#13;
schemes and alternative distribution strategies. Details of the program strategy and its phasing&#13;
are provided in the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
Program Management&#13;
3.16 Support will be provided to CNM in the form of (a) staff training; (b) technical&#13;
assistance; (c) facility renovation and upgrading; (d) office equipment; and (e) vehicles&#13;
(motorcycles) for program supervision at the provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
3.17  Training to be supported includes training of trainers programs, short courses for health&#13;
workers in malaria treatment and control, and CNM staff training, including foreign scholarships,&#13;
in areas such as information, education and communication, health policy and management,&#13;
medical sociology, parasitology/entomology and epidemiology.&#13;
Evaluation and Research&#13;
3.18  Current NMP strategies and activities are based on limited information. The expanded&#13;
interventions that are to be supported will require more effort in evaluation and operational&#13;
research if they are to have the desired impact. Financing will therefore be provided for a series&#13;
of evaluation and research studies, including evaluations of in vivo drug resistance, expanding&#13;
the use of artemesinin based anti-malarials, vector prevalence and mosquito biting habits, malaria&#13;
parasite prevalence, the impact of impregnated mosquito nets, social marketing, and operational&#13;
research into rapid antigen test kits and examination of malaria during pregnancy and early&#13;
childhood.&#13;
HIV/AIDS Program (US$6.5 million equivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
3.19  The objective of this sub-component is to counter the spread of the HIV virus. Assistance&#13;
will be provided to increase the staff and financial resource base of the National AIDS Office&#13;
(NAO) so as to enhance its ability to provide the overall guidance and management of the&#13;
HIV/AIDS program. Providing direction and leadership to the program and coordinating donor&#13;
and NGO contributions will improve a situation marked by a matrix of initiatives, undertaken&#13;
with good intentions but lacking coordination and possibly sustainability.&#13;
3.20  Ultimately, the Bank's support for the HIV/AIDS program is expected to contribute to&#13;
reduction in the transmission rate thus limiting the spread of the virus. Evidence from other&#13;
countries indicates that such an outcome is possible through effecting behavior change. It is&#13;
known to require an intensive effort and to take time. Achieving this objective will result in&#13;
diminished morbidity and mortality among the working population, reduce child mortality and&#13;
the number of orphans and lower the considerable direct and indirect financial burden of an&#13;
unchecked epidemic. The total base cost financing for the HIV/AIDS program for the period&#13;
1996-2000 is estimated to be US$ 10 million.&#13;
3.21  The project will support the key elements of a national strategy to address the problem&#13;
both at the country and provincial level through the following activities:&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
3.22 National Level. The National AIDS Office will be strengthened through the provision of&#13;
(i) supplies and equipment, including communication equipment; (ii) training; (iii) technical&#13;
assistance; and (iv) logistical and financial support for supervision of national activities for&#13;
which the NAO will be directly responsible, as well as of provincial AIDS programs (see&#13;
Annex 3). Travel to attend international meetings about HIV/AIDS and STDs will be provided.&#13;
Technical assistance will be provided to support program management and implementation and&#13;
related activities on a declining basis over the life of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
3.23  Provincial Level. Support in the form of supplies, equipment and motorcycles will be&#13;
provided for provincial HIV/AIDS programs to increase their capacity to implement and&#13;
supervise AIDS program activities, including sentinel surveillance activities, monitoring NGO&#13;
programs funded out of the Small Grants Programs, peer education activities and supervising&#13;
counseling services at the provincial blood banks.&#13;
Prevention Programs&#13;
3.24 Information, Education and Communication. The project will support a broad and&#13;
intensive program of ensuring the population is well informed about the nature of the AIDS&#13;
epidemic and how personal risk may be minimized. It is expected that much of the creative work&#13;
which this entails, such as preparing radio and TV spots, will be contracted out to the private&#13;
sector. Similarly, the actual broadcasting of prepared material will be undertaken by private&#13;
radio and TV stations in addition to Government channels. The resources for this program will&#13;
be managed through the NAO. A media director and supporting staff will be hired by the NAO&#13;
to assist the NAO with its responsibility for managing the IEC program. Technical assistance&#13;
will be provided to assist in the preparation of communication strategies and advise on message&#13;
content and programming.&#13;
3.25  Blood Transfusion Services.  To ensure that the blood supply remains HIV-free,&#13;
financing will be provided for a supply of testing reagents for HIV screening in those centers&#13;
already established and also for in-service training and a quality control program. Selected staff&#13;
at the National Blood Transfusion Center and the provincial level will receive training in&#13;
counseling for donors found to be HIV+. Assistance will also be provided for the establishment&#13;
of a further 8 provincial blood transfusion centers (Kandal, Koh Kong, Mundalkiri, Preah Vihear,&#13;
Prey Veng, Rattanankiri, Sihanoukville, and Stung Treng).&#13;
3.26 Risk Behavior Reduction:&#13;
(a)   Outreach Program. The NAO currently administers an outreach program to&#13;
raise AIDS awareness. This program will be expanded with project support for&#13;
the first two years. During negotiations, agreement was reached that program&#13;
performance will be evaluated and the evaluation report submitted to IDA not&#13;
later than December 31, 1997. Further support for outreach activities will be&#13;
made available from unallocated project funds, provided the evaluation is fully&#13;
satisfactory (para 7.1 (g)). Financing will be made available for motorcycles for&#13;
outreach workers, and supplies such as T-shirts for the peer educators trained by&#13;
the outreach workers; and a program of workshops for the outreach workers,&#13;
which will include counseling skills. A program of central-level support will be&#13;
initiated and technical assistance will be provided to assist with program&#13;
development.  Study tours to neighboring countries will enhance program&#13;
effectiveness through observing alternative approaches and networking with&#13;
colleagues. An incentive program will be maintained for peer educators and&#13;
outreach workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(b)   Condom Promotion. Condoms are successfully socially marketed throughout&#13;
Cambodia, and the project will not support this activity. However, limited&#13;
support will be provided for condom supplies used for special activities, such as&#13;
the outreach program and STD clinics where condoms are initially provided free&#13;
to commercial sex workers and patients.&#13;
Treatment Program for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)&#13;
3.27  The National Center for Dermatology and Venereology will be strengthened to enable it&#13;
to perform more adequately its function as a national referral center for STDs and as a core&#13;
training center. To accomplish this aim, the training and laboratory facilities will be expanded&#13;
and upgraded accompanied by a program of staff improvement both at the laboratory and clinical&#13;
levels. The core staff will be responsible for introducing the syndromic approach to STD&#13;
diagnosis and management through a systematic program of training trainers at the provincial&#13;
AIDS office, who will become responsible for conducting training for provincial and district&#13;
health staff. This will be supported with technical assistance and resources to conduct specific&#13;
epidemiological and other studies related to STD management. At the provincial level, five&#13;
additional STD provincial referral clinics will be established at Kampong Speu, Kampong Thom,&#13;
Kampot/Kep, Kratie and Rattanakiri. Developing activities among private sector providers will&#13;
be entrusted to NGOs through the Small Grants Program.&#13;
Monitoring, Research and Evaluation&#13;
3.28  The sentinel surveillance program will be sustained throughout the life of the project on&#13;
an annual basis. A behavioral surveillance system, which will determine whether behavior&#13;
change is occurring, will be introduced on a trial basis at a limited number of sites. For ongoing&#13;
program monitoring and evaluation, resources for studies and operational research will be&#13;
established to be used in a flexible manner and in response to identified problems and needs. An&#13;
annual program evaluation will be undertaken through a workshop using technical assistance.&#13;
Small Grants Program&#13;
3.29  A fund will be established under the NAO to provide grant financing for HIV/AIDS-&#13;
related activities to be undertaken by the NGO community/private sector. It is anticipated that&#13;
these resources will largely be directed towards local Cambodian NGOs. Identification of&#13;
activities will be a two way process, by the NGOs themselves and by the NAO program which&#13;
may require NGO capacity to carry out Government policy and program interventions. While&#13;
the fund will be managed by the NAO, the decisions on grant awards will be subject to approval&#13;
by a Project Grant Committee, charged with reviewing and approving proposals for Grants&#13;
submitted by prospective Grantees. The proposed operational polices and procedures of the&#13;
Project Grants Program and management arrangements for this committee are detailed in Annex&#13;
3. During negotiations the government provided assurances to appoint an HIVWAIDS Project&#13;
Grant Committee not later than January 31, 1997, with responsibilities and membership&#13;
satisfactory to IDA (para. 7. 1 (s)).&#13;

Component II. Health Service Strengthening&#13;
(US$18.1 million eguivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
3.30  In order to ensure the effectiveness of the malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS programs,&#13;
the overall health delivery system in which these programs operate and on which they depend for&#13;
implementation needs to be strengthened. Under this component, the project will support&#13;
investments to upgrade the Ministry of Health and its basic health service delivery apparatus at&#13;
the provincial level and below and to restore acceptable standards of facilities, equipment, and&#13;
essential drug supply. Basic management procedures will be also introduced to improve&#13;
performance and accountability within the public health system (see para. 5.4).&#13;
3.31   The national Health Coverage Plan, according to which the distribution of facilities,&#13;
equipment, staff and services will be rationalized by population, epidemiologic patterns, special&#13;
access conditions, and affordability, provides a sound framework for planning and phasing the&#13;
health strengthening component. The Government's immediate objective is to increase the flow&#13;
of resources to the peripheral level so as to establish an efficient district health system that&#13;
provides communities with accessible and quality health care. In keeping with this policy,&#13;
project financing will predominantly be directed to upgrading health centers and referral&#13;
hospitals.&#13;
3.32 During the transitional phase while the Health Coverage Plan is being implemented, in&#13;
effect, four categories of health facilities would exist at the district level and below: health&#13;
centers which offer the minimum package of services; district hospitals which would operate as&#13;
health centers in the future, but would maintain their TB diagnosis and treatment capacity; basic&#13;
referral hospitals which would support essential public health programs but would offer only&#13;
limited surgical services; and full referral hospitals which would provide services corresponding&#13;
to the full complementary package of services as defined under the Health Coverage Plan.&#13;
3.33  Selection of Provinces and Facilities for Upgrading.  Due to the widespread&#13;
destruction and neglect of health infrastructure, the total needs for health facility upgrading are&#13;
high, and well exceed the capacity of the MOH to staff, equip, supply and manage over five&#13;
years. Therefore, a set of criteria was developed to prioritize provinces for project investment.&#13;
The five criteria are: (i) disease incidence and prevalence (TB and malaria), (ii) management&#13;
capacity, (iii) accessibility, (iv) population size, and (v) support from the ADB Basic Health&#13;
Services Project (see Annex 4). Using the above methodology, a practical phased program of&#13;
construction and support was developed for ten priority provinces in two phases (I and II). The&#13;
six phase I provinces (upgrading to begin in the first year of implementation) are Battambang,&#13;
Kampot/Kep, Kandal, Kompong Speu, Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. The four phase II provinces&#13;
(upgrading to begin in the second year of implementation) are Kampong Thom, Kratie, Pursat&#13;
and Rattanakiri. The project will support the needs of this program over a five year period,&#13;
beginning in late 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
3.34  The project will support the following activities:&#13;
Facilities Upgrading (US$10.2 million eguivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
3.35  The project will support investments in the construction and rehabilitation of 26 referral&#13;
hospitals and 230 health centers in the ten provinces. 57 health centers (including 26 with TB&#13;
ward renovations), 6 basic referral hospitals and 15 full referral hospitals would be rehabilitated,&#13;
173 health centers would be newly constructed and 2 basic referral hospitals and 3 full referral&#13;
hospitals would undergo major renovations (see Annex 4 for details by province and phasing&#13;
arrangements).&#13;
Medical Equipment, Furniture and Transportation (US$2.9 million equivalent estimated base&#13;
cost)&#13;
3.36 The Health Coverage Plan outlines the minimum package of activities to be provided at&#13;
the first level health center as well as at the referral hospital. Using this as a basis, and in&#13;
consultation with relevant donors, MOH has identified a standard list of. equipment to be&#13;
provided under the project which would support the core public health activities in these&#13;
facilities. Lists of equipment to be provided for the health centers and referral hospitals under&#13;
the project are provided in Annex 5. The quantities of equipment and furniture to be provided at&#13;
each level have been adjusted to reflect expected inputs from other donors. The delivery of&#13;
equipment will be synchronized with the phasing plan for facility upgrading.&#13;
Essential Drugs (US$2.3 million equivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
3.37  The national needs for essential drugs, including those needed for the treatment of&#13;
tuberculosis, malaria and STDs was estimated, based on an agreed list, and the projected costs&#13;
were matched with the expected government and donor financing. The project will provide&#13;
funding at the national level to cover the financing gap. The list of drugs to be supplied is&#13;
provided in Annex 6.&#13;
In-Service Training (US$0.2 million eguivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
3.38  Substantial donor support has already been committed for in-service training, particularly&#13;
through an ADB Basic Skills Development Project and a WHO/UNDP/ODA Health Systems&#13;
Strengthening Project. It is estimated that the total flow of donor funds into in-service training&#13;
will be at least US$5.3 million over the next five years. Based on an analysis of the training&#13;
needs and costs for health staff throughout the country, it appears that in the medium-term no&#13;
additional donor resources are required for training of basic health staff. However, there is an&#13;
urgent need to train surgeons, obstetricians and anesthetists to provide emergency obstetric and&#13;
surgical care. An MOH committee is in the process of designing a national in-service training&#13;
strategy in obstetrics/surgery for the country. A one year curriculum will be developed and&#13;
training institutes identified and strengthened by the end of 1996. The project will directly&#13;
support the training of two surgeons/obstetricians and one anesthetist in each of the full referral&#13;
hospitals upgraded under the project. During project implementation, staff of the MOH and&#13;
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will work closely with the institutions and NGOs involved in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
training to ensure that the management and in-service training needs of other health staff in the&#13;
project provinces are met.&#13;
MOH Strengthening (US$2.6 million equivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
3.39  The Disease Control Project, and the ADB Basic Health Services Project, are the first&#13;
major investment projects in support of the MOH and will require some strengthening of the&#13;
MOH to coordinate and manage. The purpose of this sub-component, therefore, is to establish an&#13;
effective coordination mechanism and management team within the MOH; build-up skills in&#13;
areas such as procurement, disbursement, financial management and accounting; and improve the&#13;
capacity of MOH and the provincial directorates in program management, including field&#13;
supervision, data collection, progress monitoring and reporting.&#13;
3.40  The health centers specified in para 3.32 above are new types of facilities, and very few&#13;
currently exist in the country. Health staff are not used to working in and operating this type of&#13;
facility nor are they used to working as a facility based health service team at anything below the&#13;
current district hospitals. Therefore, a program of training, operational support, and intensive&#13;
supervision needs to be provided to each health center staff team at the time of commissioning of&#13;
the facility. The initial development and implementation of this process will be provided in a&#13;
central technical assistance contract, but the effort should be integrated into provinces' and the&#13;
MOH Training Division's normal operations as quickly as possible. This effort should draw on&#13;
the experience of NGOs who have constructed and commissioned the few health centers which&#13;
exist. This effort should also be supported by provincial health advisors and other managerial&#13;
technical assistance provided to the MOH, particularly the Accelerated District Development&#13;
scheme support. The agreement on quantities and level of effort for this commissioning process&#13;
should form part of each province's annual Health Management Agreements (see Chapter 5,&#13;
Section B).&#13;
3.41  To achieve these objectives, the project will finance: (i) the running costs of a Project&#13;
Coordination Unit (PCU) in MOH, including technical assistance, fellowships and operational&#13;
support; (ii) office equipment and communication equipment to link the center and the provinces;&#13;
(iii) limited renovation and construction of MOH administration buildings and the Department of&#13;
Pharmacy; (iv) a baseline survey to establish current health status and performance indicators&#13;
(ADB will support a final national evaluation survey); (v) a 2.5 year contract for technical&#13;
assistance and operational costs for initial implementation of health centers commissioning (the&#13;
initial recurrent costs and all the costs after the middle of the third year will be the responsibility&#13;
of the Government); and (vi) a provincial Supervision Fund to cover the travel, per diem costs&#13;
and office costs of project supervision within the 10 project provinces.&#13;
3.42  The project will support pilot activities in two areas with cost recovery activities namely:&#13;
the social marketing of bednets and the training and management contract for Phase I health&#13;
centers. During negotiations agreement was reached to implement by January 31, 1997, through&#13;
MOH, a national policy satisfactory to IDA on the collection of service fees in national health&#13;
facilities including the policy on retention of fees, the policy on setting and adjusting the&#13;
schedule offees, and the allowable expenditure offee revenues (para. 7.1 (r)).&#13;

4.2     Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency allowance for unforeseen&#13;
physical additions at 5 percent of base costs (US$1.4 million equivalent) and for inflation at 10&#13;
percent of base costs (US$3.1 million equivalent) based on the standard Bank-wide guideline (for&#13;
foreign inflation) and regional guideline (for domestic inflation).&#13;
4.3     Taxation. The Government has decided to exempt all the imported goods and consultant&#13;
services purchased under the project from  duties and taxes.  Total project costs for these&#13;
categories are, therefore, calculated net of duties and taxes. During negotiations, confirmation&#13;
was obtainedfor this government exemption (para. 7.2 (a)). Local taxes may be levied to civil&#13;
works at the rates of 3-5 percent. The project cost, therefore, allocates 10 percent of civil works&#13;
cost to the Government contribution to cover any possible local taxes.&#13;

4.4     Foreign  Exchange  Components.   Direct and  indirect foreign  exchange  costs are&#13;
estimated at about 52 percent of base costs. The foreign exchange components for various&#13;
expenditure categories are as follows: civil works, 30 percent; equipment and vehicles, 95&#13;
percent; drugs, 95 percent; foreign technical assistance, 95 percent; local technical assistance, 20&#13;
percent; overseas training, 95 percent; local training, 20 percent; studies, 20 percent; grant, 50&#13;
percent; operating cost, 20 percent; and supplies, 50 percent.&#13;
4.5    Incremental Recurrent Cost. The investment in civil works and equipment have been&#13;
carefully designed to avoid an unnecessary recurrent cost burden on the government (see&#13;
Chapter 6). Most of the civil works are renovation or upgrading of existing facilities, and most&#13;
equipment provided under the project involve low-cost maintenance. The costs of maintenance&#13;
for civil works (US$0.6 million, or 2 percent of baseline cost) and for equipment (US$0.5&#13;
million, or 2 percent of baseline cost) will be fully  financed  by  the Government.   The&#13;
Government will also provide salaries for disease control staff (US$0.4 million, or 1 percent of&#13;
baseline cost). However, the three communicable disease control programs require substantial&#13;
field work, such as IEC activities, patient follow-up, mosquito net distribution, data collection&#13;
and monitoring; also each of the ten project provinces will conduct field visits down to commune&#13;
and village levels to supervise the project activities. These represent an extra burden of recurrent&#13;
costs during the life of project implementation, which will be financed on a declining basis under&#13;
the categories of operating cost and supplies (US$2.0 million, or 7 percent of baseline cost), and&#13;
the category of provincial supervision costs (US$0.1 million ).&#13;
&#13;

- 22 -&#13;
B. FINANCING&#13;
4.6     The estimated total project cost of US$35.6 million equivalent, net of taxes, would be&#13;
financed by:&#13;
(a)     a local counterpart funding of US$5.2 million equivalent, or 14.5 percent of the&#13;
total project cost, from the Government;&#13;
(b)     an ITF credit of US$30.4 million equivalent net of taxes, or 85.5 percent of the&#13;
total project cost, from ITF.&#13;
4.7     The project financing plan by expenditure categories is summarized in Table 4.3, and by&#13;
project components and year in Annex 10. The source of IDA administered funds shown in&#13;
Table 4.3 will be the ITF. The overall program financing plan, including donor contribution, is&#13;
available in the project implementation plan.&#13;

4.9   The procurement arrangements for civil works, goods and services financed by ITF&#13;
would be carried out in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loan and IDA Credits, January 19954, and are described as follows:&#13;
(a)   Civil Works.  The civil works (total estimated amount of US$12.1 million&#13;
including contingencies) carried out under the project would be generally small&#13;
and simple, consisting primarily of minor or major renovation of referral hospitals&#13;
and renovations and new construction of health centers, dispersed throughout the&#13;
ten project provinces. The average construction cost for a basic referral hospital&#13;
would be US$259,000 equivalent; for a full referral hospital, it would be&#13;
US$280,000; and for a health center the cost is about US$23,000. Rehabilitation&#13;
cost would be considerably less. Considering the nature and size of the civil&#13;
works under this project, no foreign contractors are likely to be interested in&#13;
bidding for them. Tenders/bids would be invited in accordance with the following&#13;
procedures:&#13;
(i)    National  Competitive  Bidding  for  estimated  contract  values&#13;
&gt; US$100,000.&#13;
(ii)   National Shopping for estimated contract values of US$50,000 - 100,000,&#13;
up to an aggregated amount of no more than US$3.7 million.&#13;
(iii)   Direct Contract for estimated contract values &lt; US$50,000, up to an&#13;
aggregated amount of no more than US$0.3 million.&#13;
The National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedure, acceptable to the Bank, would be used for&#13;
the majority of the civil works (up to a total amount of US$7.9 million, or 65 percent of total&#13;
civil works cost). The PCU/MOH will carry out appropriate packaging in order to manage the&#13;
NCB efficiently. A portion of civil works (up to a total amount of US$4.1 million, or 33 percent&#13;
of total civil works cost) will be carried out through National Shopping procedure with at least&#13;
three quotations from local contractors. This will apply to those facilities in remote areas where&#13;
packaging for NCB is difficult. For a small number of health centers, for which selecting&#13;
contractors through competition would be extremely difficult, direct contracting procedures,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, would be used (up to a total amount of US$0.3 million, or about 2&#13;
percent of total civil works cost). The Bank's Standard Bidding Document for Procurement of&#13;
Civil Works (Small Contracts), January 1995 would be used by PCU/MOH in preparing the&#13;
bidding documents for civil works.5&#13;
(b)   Goods (Equipment. Vehicles, and Drugs). The costs of equipment, vehicles and&#13;
materials are estimated to be US$7.6 million, including contingencies. About 70&#13;
4   The proceeds of the ITF Credit may only be withdrawn on account of expenditures for goods and works&#13;
provided by nationals of and products in or supplied from, participating countries. Only consultants from&#13;
participating countries shall be eligible to provide services financed out of the proceeds of the ITF.&#13;
5  Bidding documents will reference the ITF eligibility restrictions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
percent of this amount, amounting to US$5.3 million, will be procured by&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure.  Under ICB, domestic&#13;
manufacturers would be eligible for a margin of preference in bid evaluations of&#13;
15 percent of the c.i.f. costs of the competing imports or the applicable customs&#13;
duty, whichever is lower. About 21 percent of total equipment cost, up to an&#13;
aggregated amount of US$1.6 million with the estimated cost of US$100,000 or&#13;
less per contract, may be procured by National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedure acceptable to the Bank.  Small items or group of items costing&#13;
US$25,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$0.2 million or 3&#13;
percent of total equipment costs, may be procured by prudent shopping, requiring&#13;
quotations from at least three suppliers. The cost of drugs, estimated at US$2.7&#13;
million including contingencies, would be procured by ICB procedures. The&#13;
PCU/MOH will prepare the bidding documents in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding document for Procurement of Goods, January 1995, and the&#13;
Standard Bidding Document for Procurement of Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines,&#13;
September 1993 (as amended to reflect the changes as per the Bank's Guidelines,&#13;
January 1995, for procurement of drugs and pharmaceuticals).'&#13;
(c)   Technical Assistance, Training. and Studies. The technical assistance (estimated&#13;
cost of US$2.8 million including contingencies) will be carried out by individual&#13;
consultants or consultant firrns hired by MOH, following the Bank's Guidelines:&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency.6 The training (estimated cost of US$3.0 million including&#13;
contingencies) will be carried out by the national and provincial training centers,&#13;
or other contractors. The financial input for studies, (estimated cost of US$2.5&#13;
million including contingencies) would be used to support the special surveys and&#13;
operational research that will be conducted by competent institutions or&#13;
contractors. MOH would arrange these training, survey and study tasks by&#13;
entering into an "agreement" or "contract" with the institution or contractor. Prior&#13;
to negotiations, MOH provided IDA with its standard format for such contracting&#13;
to ensure its compliance with the Bank's Guideline and the Standard Form of&#13;
6&#13;
Contract for Consulting services, June 1995 (para. 7.3)&#13;
(d)   Incremental Operating Cost &amp; Supplies and Provincial Supervision Cost. The&#13;
incremental operating cost and supplies (estimated cost of US$2.2 million&#13;
including contingencies) would be procured through prudent shopping procedure,&#13;
requiring at least three quotations from  local suppliers.  The provincial&#13;
supervision costs (estimated cost of US$0.2 million including contingencies),&#13;
which will support small annual contracts with each provincial project unit to&#13;
cover local supervision costs, and would be procured using direct contracting&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
6  Procurement of consultants will conform to ITF eligibility restrictions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
4.10 Procurement Prior Review. All civil works contracts with an estimated cost of&#13;
US$200,000 or more, all goods contracts with an estimated cost of US$100,000 or more, and all&#13;
consulting service contracts with an estimated cost of US$100,000 or more for consulting firm&#13;
(US$50,000 for individual) would be subject to prior review by the Bank. With respect to all&#13;
consulting contracts irrespective of their values, prior review by the Bank will be required for:&#13;
(a) terms of reference; (b) single source contract regardless of value; (c) all consultant contracts&#13;
and assignments of a critical nature (because of environment safety or public health&#13;
considerations) regardless of value; (d) contract amendments valued at more than US$100,000&#13;
for firms (US$50,000 for individuals), or those that raise the total contract value to more than.&#13;
US$100,000 for firms (US$50,000 for individuals); and (e) grants more than US$5,000 per grani&#13;
agreement. This will allow prior review for approximately 80 percent of the works and goods&#13;
procured under the project.&#13;
D. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.11  The proposed ITF credit of US$30.4 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period&#13;
of five and half years (including a six-month period after the project completion date), by the&#13;
closing date of March 31, 2002. The disbursement percentages for each expenditure category are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.5.  The disbursement schedule and profile are in Annex  10.&#13;
Disbursements would be made against: (a) 90 percent of total expenditure of civil works; (b) 100&#13;
percent of c.i.f. cost of directly imported goods; 100 percent of ex-factory cost for locally&#13;
manufactured goods, and 85 percent of the other off-the-shelf goods procured locally; (c) 100&#13;
percent of total expenditures for training, technical assistance and studies; (d) 100 percent of&#13;
grant made by the National AIDS Office Grant Facility; (e) 85 percent of operating cost and&#13;
supplies; and (f) 85 percent of provincial supervision cost.&#13;

- 27 -&#13;
4.12  Disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for civil works&#13;
contracts with a contract value of less than US$200,000 equivalent; for goods contracts with a&#13;
contract value less than US$100,000 equivalent; for consulting services contracts with a contract&#13;
value less than US$100,000 for firms, and less than US$50,000 for individuals; for grants valued&#13;
at less than US$5,000 each; and for all expenditures for operating cost, supplies and provincial&#13;
supervision costs. All documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by PCU/MOH, and&#13;
made available for random sample review by IDA supervision missions.&#13;
4.13  A Special Account with an authorized allocation of US$1.5 million would be established&#13;
in a bank acceptable to the Association. The PCU/MOH would operate the Special Account with&#13;
due procedures for oversight by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. All the documentation&#13;
for the operation of the Special Account would be retained in PCU/MOH, and made available for&#13;
review by IDA.&#13;

5. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. ORGANIZATION&#13;
5.1   The implementing agency for the proposed project will be the Ministry of Health.&#13;
Overall direction and guidance for the project will be provided by a high level Steering&#13;
Committee especially created to oversee the implementation of this project. The Steering&#13;
Committee will comprise of representatives from the Ministry of Economy and Finance&#13;
(MOEF), the Ministry of Planning (MOP) and the Cambodia Development Council (CDC), as&#13;
well as senior staff of MOH. A Project Director, nominated by the Ministry of Health, will be a&#13;
member of the Steering Committee, and will have overall responsibility for the implementation&#13;
of the project.&#13;
5.2  In order to facilitate implementation, a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be set-up&#13;
within the MOH, with the support of both the World Bank and the ADB. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were received that the PCU will be headed by a PCU Manager recruited on an&#13;
international basis by the Government and approved by the World Bank and ADB, as a condition&#13;
of effectiveness (para. 7.1 (a)). The Manager will have day-to-day responsibility for ensuring the&#13;
timely and efficient implementation of the ADB and Bank-financed projects, and for building&#13;
capacity within MOH in the areas of project administration, financial management and&#13;
procurement.  The PCU  will have a Finance and Administration Unit responsible for&#13;
procurement, disbursement and accounting for both the World Bank and ADB projects. In&#13;
addition, separate units will be established to oversee implementation of the different projects.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were also obtained that the Chiefs of the Finance and&#13;
Administration Unit and World Bank Operations Unit and Construction Manager will be&#13;
recruited on an international basis and appointed as a condition of effectiveness (para. 7.1 (a)).&#13;
Certain operational costs of the PCU (PCU Manager, Finance and Administration Unit) will be&#13;
jointly funded by the World Bank and ADB. Details of the organizational structure of the PCU&#13;
and the terms of reference for the Steering Committee and the PCU staff are provided in&#13;
Annex 7.&#13;
5.3   The provincial health authorities will be responsible for the overall management and&#13;
supervision of project activities at the provincial level and will act as the link between the central&#13;
PCU/MOH and the operational district health system. A small Provincial Project Unit (PPU)&#13;
will be set-up within the health directorate, headed by a Provincial Project Director nominated by&#13;
the Provincial Health Director and confirmed by the MOH. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that appointment of a Provincial Project Director in each of the six Phase Iprovinces is&#13;
a condition of effectiveness and the appointment of a Provincial Project Unit Directors in each&#13;
of the remaining four Phase II project province is due by September 30, 1997 (para. 7.1 (b)).&#13;
The main functions of the PPU include (i) facilitating the timely implementation of the project in&#13;
close coordination with the MOH/PCU; (ii) ensuring the timely flow of funds, particularly travel&#13;
and per diem costs for supervision, paid out of the provincial Supervision Fund; and (iii) day-to-&#13;
day monitoring of the project. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Provincial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Supervision Fund agreements will be prepared, satisfactory to IDA, by June 30, 1997, and will&#13;
be entered into by September 30, 1997 for the Phase I provinces and by September 30, 1998 for&#13;
the Phase II provinces (para. 7.1 (d)). The detailed arrangements for managing the Provincial&#13;
Supervision Fund are contained in the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Health Management Agreements&#13;
5.4  In order to define the expectations and responsibilities of both the MOH and the&#13;
provincial authorities clearly under the Project, Health Management Agreements (HMA) would&#13;
be entered into for each of the ten provinces supported by the Health Strengthening component&#13;
(see Annex 8). The aim of instituting such agreements is to change the nature of the relationship&#13;
between the MOH and the provincial health authorities to one of mutual responsibility and&#13;
accountability, with a single overall purpose of improving performance of public sector health&#13;
services.&#13;
5.5   The HMAs would provide a framework for planning and managing the health programs&#13;
covered by the Project (TB, Malaria, HIV/AIDS, and Health Coverage Plan). They would&#13;
govern the provision of inputs by MOH to the provinces in return for provincial agreement to&#13;
attain annual targets in disease control and other areas. Commitments made by the MOH and the&#13;
Provincial Health Authorities would be clearly specified in terms of annual health objectives,&#13;
inputs, and processes with quantifiable and monitorable targets set. These annual plans would be&#13;
defined and agreed in the context of 5-year goals and outcome/impact indicators. The HMAs&#13;
would have no legal status, rather they would be used as a planning and management tool.&#13;
However, they will be monitored and evaluated and action would be taken in response to&#13;
performance. From the detailed performance indicators contained in the HMAs, a group of more&#13;
broadly indicative measures have been selected as Project Performance Indicators. These are&#13;
presented in Annex 9.&#13;
5.6   The HMAs will be formulated and agreed annually at provincial planning workshops&#13;
with the involvement of representatives from the Provincial Governors' Office, the Provincial&#13;
Health Directorate, MOH (including Ministry level representatives from the three disease control&#13;
programs) and the PCU. The provincial health advisors (PHAs) and donor organizations&#13;
assisting a given province will also be invited to the planning process and negotiations. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached that no expenditures by any province for civil works or&#13;
medical equipment will be made unless the Ministry of Health and the province concerned have&#13;
entered into their respective Health Management Agreement for the first year (para. 7.1 (c)).&#13;
5.7  Ideally this type of agreement would also be made between the provinces and the&#13;
districts, but currently most districts are judged managerially too weak to undertake this type of&#13;
agreement in the early stages of the Project. As district health office capacities improve, they&#13;
could enter into sub-agreements with the provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Implementation of National Disease Control Programs&#13;
Tuberculosis Control Program&#13;
5.8   The overall responsibility for implementation of the TB Control component rests with the&#13;
National Anti-Tuberculosis Center (CENAT). CENAT will be responsible for establishing the&#13;
policies for case management, consolidating annual project plans and budgets, monitoring&#13;
provincial TB control activities, and assisting in the preparation of project reports and&#13;
documentation. CENAT will prepare biannual TB drug forecasts by monitoring drug use and&#13;
stocks and, jointly with CMS, determine drug procurement and provincial allocations. Provincial&#13;
TB Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the distribution of TB drugs and supplies to the&#13;
district health facilities and for the supervision of TB case management. CENAT will conduct&#13;
five training sessions annually in short course chemotherapy, annual training of provincial&#13;
supervisors and arrange international training and fellowships. By the end of 1996, CENAT will&#13;
have trained staff in all facilities eligible to offer hospitalization and short course chemotherapy.&#13;
During negotiations, an understanding was reached that the government, with available donor&#13;
funding, wouldfinance the cost offood supplementation for TB patient hospitalization and, as&#13;
resources permit, for the ambulatory phase of chemotherapy (para. 7.2 (c)).&#13;
Malaria Control Program&#13;
5.9   The responsibility for the Malaria Control Program rests with the National Malaria&#13;
Center (CNM). CNM would have similar responsibilities as CENAT, that is, establishing the&#13;
policies for case management, consolidating annual project plans and budgets, monitoring&#13;
provincial malaria control activities, and assisting in the preparation of project reports and&#13;
documentation. CNM would also prepare biannual malaria drug forecasts by monitoring drug&#13;
use and stocks and, jointly with CMS, determine drug procurement and provincial allocations.&#13;
Provincial Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the malaria control program at the district&#13;
level and organizing training. In addition, over the life of the project, CNM staff will manage&#13;
and conduct studies of vivo and in vitro drug resistance, drug efficacy, malaria prevalence, vector&#13;
control (bednet) effectiveness, bednet social marketing and entomological studies. Research will&#13;
be carried out to test antigen test kits, examination of malaria during pregnancy, and community&#13;
based epidemiologic assessments of bednet effectiveness.&#13;
5.10  The bednet program, including the social marketing pilot activity, would be managed at&#13;
the central level by the CNM under the leadership of a Bednet Program Manager. The Program&#13;
Manager will have overall responsibility for planning and managing CNM support for&#13;
implementation at provincial, district and commune levels, and for program evaluation. A&#13;
National Bednet Steering Committee comprised of CNM, donors and, relevant NGOs, will also&#13;
be established for defining policy, standard setting and identifying resource requirements.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached that government will furnish IDA with a social&#13;
marketing and national bednet distribution and treatment strategy (including a cost recovery&#13;
proposal) by January 31, 1997for IDA review, and thereafter promptly carry out an action plan&#13;
acceptable to IDA (para. 7.1 (o)). Key partners in program implementation are ODA, WHO and&#13;
NGOs already implementing bednet projects in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
HIVIAIDS Program&#13;
5.11  Overall responsibility for the management and implementation of the HIV/AIDS&#13;
component will rest with the National AIDS Office located within the Ministry of Health. The&#13;
director of the NAO will be the HIV/AIDS and STD component Project Manager. The status of&#13;
the NAO will be raised to that of a department within MOH and additionally, a finance and an&#13;
administrative officer will be appointed to this department. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained from government that these two appointments and the elevation of NAO to&#13;
departmental status will take place not later than September 30, 1997 (para. 7.1 (f)). Technical&#13;
assistance will be provided on an intermittent basis to assist with overall project management and&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.12 The HIV/AIDS Grant Fund will be managed through a Project Grants Committee&#13;
consisting of the director of the NAO (chairperson), a representative of the MOH/PCU and other&#13;
representation to be determined. The Committee will solicit applications to the Fund, review&#13;
these applications and reach decisions about the content of activities to be supported and the&#13;
resources to be allocated. The Committee will also be responsible for reviewing progress and&#13;
evaluating results of activities undertaken through this Fund.  Details of the proposed&#13;
management structure and operational procedures of the Fund are provided in Annex 3.&#13;
5.13  The Project will finance several elements of the blood safety effort under the MOH Blood&#13;
Transfusion Services. Training of counselors to notify HIV positive blood donors will require&#13;
first an agreement on notification and counseling protocols progress on which is well advanced&#13;
between the MOH, the International Commission for the Red Cross and other donors.&#13;
Implementation of Health Service Strengthening&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
5.14  The MOH/PCU will be responsible for initiating, monitoring and ensuring that correct&#13;
implementation procedures are followed during all stages of civil works implementation. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached on the criteria to be usedfor the selection of health centers&#13;
and referral hospitals for upgrading (para. 7.1 (p)). The PCU will contract with qualified&#13;
personnel to prepare technical specifications, supervise construction and disbursements, and be&#13;
responsible for certification of completion. During negotiations, assurances were receivedfrom&#13;
government that final implementation arrangements for contracting and supervision of civil&#13;
works would be established by December 31, 1996 for Phase I provinces and by December 31,&#13;
1997 for Phase II provinces (para. 7.1 (i)).&#13;
5.15  Details of the implementation arrangements are provided in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan. In summary, the PCU would select consultants, in accordance with Bank guidelines, to&#13;
inspect existing facilities and prepare the final design proposals, based on the PCU models, for&#13;
MOH/PCU approval.  Once approved, the PCU initiates the preparation of the bidding&#13;
documents. Tenders/bids are then invited by the PCU in accordance with agreed procurement&#13;
guidelines. Contract supervision will be carried out by the consultants who will report monthly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
to the PCU/Construction Manager. The PPU will also monitor the work on a random basis and&#13;
report to the MOH/PCU.&#13;
5.16  The importance and form of an institutionalized maintenance and repair strategy for civil&#13;
works was agreed with the MOH during preparation. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
receivedfrom government that a senior technicalfacilities manager will be appointed no later&#13;
than September 30, 1997 in the Phase I provinces and not later than September 30, 1998 in the&#13;
Phase II provinces (para. 7.1 (e)).  The facilities manager will be responsible for the&#13;
management and supervision of regular and preventive maintenance of all health facilities in that&#13;
province. He/she will have a budget specifically for maintenance which will be used to contract&#13;
reliable local contractors to do the work.&#13;
Equipment, Essential Drugs and In-Service Training&#13;
5.17 Both medical equipment and drugs would be procured by the MOH/PCU, in close&#13;
collaboration with the Procurement Unit at the Department of Pharmacy.  Storage and&#13;
distribution would be done through the logistics system of the Central Medical Stores (CMS) of&#13;
the Ministry of Health. This logistics system is considered adequate to meet the needs of the&#13;
project, given the recent expansion in warehouse and trucking capacity under a previous IDA&#13;
project. Basic equipment provided under the project would predominantly be low maintenance.&#13;
Maintenance of more complex equipment, such as X-ray machines, would be written into the&#13;
purchase contract. In addition, training in the routine maintenance of hospital equipment will be&#13;
provided to technicians in the referral hospitals upgraded under the project. Monitoring and&#13;
control of drug and equipment supplies would be done through the existing computerized&#13;
tracking system, so as to avoid irregular supplies. Indicators would be set and their progress&#13;
tracked over time to monitor and improve the planning and timeliness of the procurement and&#13;
distribution of medical supplies, drugs and equipment.&#13;
5.18 During negotiations, assurances were obtained from government that the health centers&#13;
and referral hospitals upgraded under the project be adequately staffed (para. 7.1 (q)). During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were also obtainedfrom Government that a national in-service training&#13;
strategy be implemented by March 31, 1997. Moreover, a time bound plan for the training of&#13;
health staff at the health centers and referral hospitals upgraded under the project will be&#13;
furnished to IDA by March 31, 1997, and promptly thereafter, the government will carry out&#13;
such a plan taking into account IDA's comments (para. 7.1 (n)). Such a plan would include&#13;
disease control training supported by the project. The MOH/PCU will be responsible for&#13;
identifying the medical personnel for the one year training in obstetrics/surgery and&#13;
anesthesiology. The training will take place at national and provincial institutes selected by the&#13;
MOH Committee on surgical training.&#13;
C. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITING&#13;
5.19 The total project account would be managed by the PCU in the MOH, and separate&#13;
accounts for project activities would also be maintained by each province (for the expenses&#13;
eligible for reimbursement under the provincial supervision cost category) and national institutes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
in accordance with sound accounting practices. The project accounts would reflect all financial&#13;
transactions during the project implementation period for both the IDA Credit and the&#13;
counterpart funding in two books, one by project components and one by expenditure categories.&#13;
5.20  Project accounts would be audited in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial&#13;
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (1992). During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained that audits of project-related financial records and accounts,&#13;
including the Special Account, will be undertaken in accordance with appropriate accounting&#13;
principles by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.  Audited accounts and financial&#13;
statements, in a format agreed with IDA, and including audited Statement of Expenditures, will&#13;
be sent to IDA within six months after the end of each Government fiscal year (para. 7.1 6)). In&#13;
addition, at negotiations, assurances were obtained that Technical Performance Audits of HMAs&#13;
will be carried out on a random basis beginning in January 1998 (para. 7.1 (h)).&#13;
D. PROJECT MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
5.21  The PCU will be responsible for monitoring project implementation progress and&#13;
performance. A baseline survey would be conducted in the first year of implementation to&#13;
establish project performance indicator measures. The Health Management Agreements would&#13;
set out implementation targets against which project performance will be monitored. During&#13;
negotiations, an understanding was reached that monitoring of these targets would be carried&#13;
out on a semi-annual basis by the PCU, commencing Fiscal Year 1997, which will then report to&#13;
IDA on (i) progress on major activities; and (ii) achievement or production of agreed outputs&#13;
(para. 7.2 (b)). The Project Performance Indicators in Annex 9 provide the framework for the&#13;
semi-annual reports, the format of which should be acceptable to IDA. There will be an annual&#13;
review of HMA performance at the provincial level before planning the following year's&#13;
agreement. During negotiations, assurances were received that an annual project budget will be&#13;
submitted by the PCU to IDA by November 30 of each year in the Project, beginning November&#13;
30, 1996 (para. 7.1 (m)).&#13;
5.22 During negotiations, assurances were received that by March 31, 1999, the MOH will&#13;
submit a comprehensive mid-term review report evaluating project performance based on the&#13;
documented experience of the monitoring, as well as at least one impact study and the technical&#13;
performance audits. Based on this review, discussions will be held with IDA by June 30, 1999,&#13;
as to the need for any changes in project design and the implementation targets (para. 7.1 (k)).&#13;
Also, assurances were obtained from the Government that a final evaluative survey would be&#13;
carried out by June 30, 2001 and the results of this survey would be furnished to IDA for&#13;
comments by March 31, 2002. Within six months of the closing date, the Government will submit&#13;
afinal report to IDA on the project and a plan of such scope and detail, IDA may request for the&#13;
future operation of the completed project (para. 7.1 (1)).&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
5.23  The proposed project would have no significant impact on the environment. Protocols&#13;
would be developed for the safe disposal of syringes and medical waste at all health facilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
covered under the Health Strengthening component, and their implementation would be&#13;
monitored during supervision. Permethrin, or another similar insecticide, will be used to&#13;
impregnate bednets distributed under the malaria program. These are non-toxic to mammals and&#13;
are classified as "unlikely to present any health hazard in normal use." They are toxic to aquatic&#13;
fauna, including fish. However, its restricted and supervised use under the bednet program will&#13;
exclude any environmental impact. Project activities will result in no involuntary resettlement or&#13;
displacement.&#13;
F. PARTICIPATION&#13;
5.24  Project preparation was conducted using a participatory approach, and all efforts were&#13;
made to involve various stakeholders in project design and implementation decisions. First,&#13;
extensive discussions were held with MOH staff, provincial and district health authorities and&#13;
donors, including provincial health advisors, to determine the scope and coverage of the project.&#13;
Second, technical working groups drawn from the line departments were convened to consider&#13;
policy and technical issues specific to the project components. Third, a number of seminars were&#13;
held on various topics such as Health Management Agreements, AIDS, and Malaria to invite&#13;
comments and suggestions from a wider audience with representation from NGOs.&#13;
5.25  A PHRD grant has funded key aspects of project preparation, and the execution of the&#13;
grant is split between MOH and the Association. MOH has used these funds to conduct various&#13;
surveys and studies including an infrastructure and equipment survey, a social marketing study, a&#13;
TB patient compliance study and a study of intravenous drug abuse as a potential route of HIV&#13;
transmission (the latter three studies all employed focus group research techniques) to determine&#13;
component inputs based on community needs. A project implementation plan has been prepared&#13;
by MOH and jointly reviewed with the mission on a regular basis. In addition, during the later&#13;
stages of project preparation and implementation, evaluation and assessment activities will be&#13;
carried out to measure potential and actual popular response to service strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6. PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
6.1   The benefits of the project correspond to measurable indicators of impact on the three&#13;
targeted disease control programs and in the improved access of rural Cambodians to basic health&#13;
services. The performance of the project will be measured in detail in the 10 provinces in which&#13;
the project will combine its health strengthening investments, its managerial improvements, and&#13;
its national disease control activities. In addition, the project will measure results of the three&#13;
disease control programs on a national basis, to evaluate the impact of indivisible national&#13;
program investments. A list of performance indicators by input, output, and impact and by&#13;
project and national program scope is detailed in Annex 9.&#13;
6.2   For TB, the total number of treated cases over the five year period is targeted at 106,000.&#13;
This is based on the need to reach an annual treatment target of 24,000 in the final year of the&#13;
project, at which point the annual prevalent pool of cases should have begun to decrease and the&#13;
incidence of new cases to decline. The project will calculate the annual risk of infection in the&#13;
final year of the project to estimate whether these declines, set to occur over a 5 to 10 year time&#13;
frame, have commenced. Such declines could be delayed by a substantial AIDS-associated rise&#13;
in TB cases. The fatality rate of active, untreated TB cases is not known for Cambodia with&#13;
precision. However, practitioners regard it, with malaria, as one of the leading causes of&#13;
premature fatality among children and especially young adults.&#13;
6.3   For malaria control, the project will intervene to treat the disease through more effective&#13;
case management and to prevent infection through bednet vector control. The incidence of&#13;
malaria in any one area is highly variable from year to year depending on weather, migration and&#13;
work habits, and to the quality of clinics and hospitals which will determine the flow of patients&#13;
with malaria. The malaria program has targeted a 30 percent decline in incidence over three&#13;
years in its first phase provinces for bednet distribution. The overall impact measure will be a&#13;
proxy indicator of the prevalence of malaria at a point in time; this will be determined by means&#13;
of periodic surveys of blood slide positively in the population. The impact on mortality will be&#13;
measured by the hospital case fatality rate, which is targeted to decline to below 2 percent by the&#13;
year 2000.&#13;
6.4   Impact on HIV incidence is difficult to predict due to the early stage of the epidemic, the&#13;
difficulty in predicting its likely trajectory, and the need for more knowledge of the effectiveness&#13;
of the various preventive interventions supported by the project. Further analytical work will be&#13;
conducted under the project to determine the possible path of the epidemic based on recently&#13;
analyzed Thai epidemiologic data. It is certainly probable that at a minimum, the rate of increase&#13;
of sero-positive blood donations will decline from its current doubling every year to far lower&#13;
rates of increase, and that the same will occur in the data on key risk groups (prostitutes and&#13;
soldiers), as has been the case in Thailand. The performance of the HIV component will be&#13;
measured more reliably by input and output indicators in the early stages of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
6.5   The beneficiaries of the TB and Malaria Control Programs will tend to be poor, rural&#13;
residents. Children and women will likely share these benefits at least in proportion to their&#13;
shares of population, which in Cambodia are higher than regional averages. The beneficiaries of&#13;
the HIV program will be members of the core risk groups in the near term, as they will receive&#13;
disproportionate levels of interventions through the NGO Small Grants Program, the Outreach&#13;
Program and sentinel surveillance. In addition, rural families in the 10 project provinces will&#13;
benefit from increased access to health centers offering the Government's minimum package of&#13;
services. Upgraded referral hospitals will provide the full range of Health Coverage Plan&#13;
Clinical Services.&#13;
6.6   The Health Strengthening component will improve access and raise utilization of modem&#13;
health services at the health center and hospital level in the 10 project provinces. About 2&#13;
million people will have access to health centers and functioning referral facilities as a result of&#13;
the project.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
6.7   There are three main project risks. First, the management capacities of the MOH and its&#13;
provincial counterparts have been overestimated, such that implementation of the provincial Health&#13;
Management Agreements will be slower than planned. Second, there is a possible shortage of&#13;
adequately skilled health personnel to staff and run the upgraded district-level facilities. Third, the&#13;
zone of insecurity (due to the continuing insurgency) may expand rather than contract, causing the&#13;
project to restrict its investments to a smaller scale than envisioned.&#13;
6.8   Care has been taken to minimize these risks during project preparation and appraisal. In&#13;
terms of management capacity, both the scale and phasing of the project have been designed to&#13;
reflect the management and implementation capabilities at the provincial levels. Management&#13;
capacity, measured in part by the presence of a donor-funded health advisor at the provincial&#13;
level, was a key criterion in determining which provinces the project would cover and how to&#13;
phase project inputs. Management training will be provided under a contract for health center&#13;
commissioning and through a parallel WHO-executed project.&#13;
6.9   As for the potential lack of adequately skilled and trained staff, the management and&#13;
skills training needs of the provincial and district health authorities has been assessed and an&#13;
initial estimate made of the resources committed to these programs by other donors. Sufficient&#13;
resources are available to cover most in-service training requirements. The Government has&#13;
agreed to prepare a National In-Service Training Plan to guide the allocation of Government and&#13;
donor resources. The project will provide for training of surgeons and anesthetists placed in full&#13;
referral hospitals. The PCU will coordinate closely with the donors and NGOs involved in&#13;
training, to ensure that the training needs of the IDA-financed provinces will be met.&#13;
6.10  The only risk that cannot be reduced through project preparation efforts is insecurity, a&#13;
factor affecting all development investments in Cambodia. For the past year, the zone of&#13;
insecurity has contracted steadily, an encouraging but not yet definitive development in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Cambodian context. The project design has taken the current situation into account by reducing&#13;
project activities in provinces where the security situation remains unstable.&#13;
C. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
Fiscal Impact&#13;
6.11   The annual recurrent cost implications of the project itself are minor. These include&#13;
maintenance and repair costs for facilities, replacement of foreign financed inputs, such as&#13;
medical equipment, bednets and to a much smaller extent drugs, 80 percent of which will be&#13;
financed by the Government budget during the project. Thus, these recurrent costs of US$2.6&#13;
million would consume less than 5.2 percent of the projected health budget in the year 2001.&#13;
Even if the analysis uses total program recurrent costs (instead of the project), the burden is still&#13;
manageable. The annual recurrent cost implications of the program have been estimated to be&#13;
approximately US$12 million a year. These recurrent costs cover the major health programs of&#13;
the MOH and the provincial delivery system. A report on Sustainability Analysis is included in&#13;
the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
Cost Recovery&#13;
6.12  In several instances, the project has assessed the potential for cost recovery initiatives,&#13;
with positive results. Thus, within the broad public health rationale for public financing, there&#13;
are health services for which there is substantial (if inadequate) willingness to pay, with potential&#13;
benefits to project sustainability and, to a lesser extent, the government's fiscal position.&#13;
6.13  In the case of bednet distribution, a market feasibility study was completed for appraisal,&#13;
indicating that the bednet market in Cambodia was large and well distributed nationally, but that&#13;
prices confined demand to the more well-off households. Using focus group methods, the&#13;
analysis indicated a range of subsidized prices which would be affordable for the populations&#13;
living in endemic areas. These findings will be applied to a social marketing pilot in two&#13;
provinces and to the government's distribution of bednets through health facilities.&#13;
6.14  In the case of new health centers constructed under the project, an analysis of pilot health&#13;
centers and the implementation of a modest out-patient fee schedule revealed promising results&#13;
for the sustainability, utilization, and quality of health center services. Thus, the project will&#13;
finance the introduction of a similar cost recovery mechanism in Phase I provinces.&#13;
6.15   Finally, the study on TB food supplementation (see above) considered lowering the food&#13;
subsidy so as to lower food costs and raise patient contribution to their treatment. Patients&#13;
receive free drugs, hospitalization, and food under current policy, but must pay transport costs,&#13;
and foregone household production. The analysis concluded that the very low income profile of&#13;
TB patients argued for a full food subsidy, as did the evidence of low patient compliance in&#13;
hospitals where food supplementation was interrupted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38 -&#13;
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:&#13;
(a)   it will establish a Project Coordination Unit, with competent personnel in&#13;
sufficient numbers, and select a PCU Manager, the Chief of the Administration&#13;
and Finance Unit, the Chief of the World Bank Operations Unit and a&#13;
Construction Manager in the World Bank Operations Unit acceptable to IDA, as a&#13;
condition of effectiveness (para. 5.2).&#13;
(b)   a Provincial Project Unit in the Provincial Health Directorate will be established&#13;
and the Provincial Project Director appointed for each of the six Phase I project&#13;
provinces as a condition of effectiveness. The Provincial Project Directors for&#13;
each of the four Phase I1 provinces would be appointed by September 30, 1997&#13;
(para. 5.3).&#13;
(c)   no expenditures by any province for civil works or medical equipment will be&#13;
made unless the Ministry of Health and the province concerned have entered into&#13;
their respective Health Management Agreement for the first year (para. 5.6).&#13;
(d)   it will prepare, satisfactory to IDA, implementation arrangements for the&#13;
provincial supervision costs, including the basic agreement between the MOH and&#13;
the participating Provincial Project Director, by June 30, 1997. It will enter into&#13;
such supervision agreements with Phase I provinces by September 30, 1997 and&#13;
Phase II provinces by September 30, 1998 (para. 5.3).&#13;
(e)   it will appoint senior technical facilities managers responsible for management of&#13;
regular preventive maintenance of upgraded provincial health facilities by&#13;

(g)   it will prepare a performance evaluation report of the Outreach Program under the&#13;
HIV/AIDS Component covering the first two years of implementation, and submit&#13;
for the approval of IDA, not later than December 31, 1997, the evaluation report&#13;
and recommendations for further financing of the outreach program from the&#13;
unallocated category of the project (para. 3.26).&#13;
(h)   technical performance audits of the implementation of HMAs will be conducted&#13;
on a random basis starting in January, 1998 and the audit reports will be submitted&#13;
to IDA (para 5.20).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
(i)   it will enter into a contractual relationship, acceptable to IDA, to prepare the&#13;
technical specifications and bidding documents, to supervise construction and to&#13;
disburse to contractors, for the first phase of construction of facilities by&#13;
December 31, 1996 and for the second phase of construction by December 31,&#13;
1997 (para. 5.14).&#13;
(j)   audits of project-related records and accounts, including the Special Account, will&#13;
be undertaken in accordance with appropriate accounting principles consistently&#13;
applied, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and that audited accounts and&#13;
financial statements, in a format agreed with IDA, and including separate audits of&#13;
Statement of Expenditures, will be sent to IDA within six months of the end of&#13;
each Government fiscal year (para. 5.20).&#13;
(k)   it will prepare under terms of reference satisfactory to the Association, and&#13;
furnish to the Association, on or about March 31, 1999, a report integrating the&#13;
results of the monitoring and evaluation activities on the progress achieved in the&#13;
carrying out of the Project during the period preceding the date of the report. This&#13;
report will be reviewed with IDA by June 30, 1999 (para. 5.22).&#13;
(1)   it will conduct a final evaluative survey by June 30, 2001 and submit to IDA, by&#13;
March 31, 2002, the results of this survey. The final evaluation report on the&#13;
project and a plan of such scope and detail as IDA may request for the future&#13;
operation of the completed project will be submitted to IDA within six months of&#13;
the Completion Date of the Project (para. 5.22).&#13;
(m)   it will no later than November 30 in each fiscal year, commencing November 30,&#13;
1996, and until completion of the Project, furnish to the Association the annual&#13;
work program and related budget for all project activities, acceptable to IDA&#13;
(para. 5.21).&#13;
(n)   it will prepare and implement a National In-Service Training Plan and Strategy&#13;

KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA&#13;
DISEASE CONTROL AND HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Support to National Tuberculosis Program&#13;
The detailed TB component description and budget is found in the project implementation&#13;
plan.&#13;
I. Background&#13;
1.    The National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) was started in 1980 with the establishment&#13;
of a national network of microscopists and treatment centers. The program has been&#13;
reorganized to incorporate short course tuberculosis therapy, long term technical support by&#13;
the World Health Organization (WHO), the production and distribution of a TB program&#13;
manual, a change in clinical and laboratory records in accordance with international&#13;
standards, and a change from suboptimal 12 month anti-TB therapy to a modem short course&#13;
therapy, all starting in 1994.&#13;
2.    The "new" NTP is being implemented by the Centre National Anti Tuberculeux&#13;
(CENAT), one of the seven central institutes in the Ministry of Health. CENAT consists of a&#13;
central office in Phnom Penh with approximately 20 staff and over 115 provincial and&#13;
district hospitals throughout the country. Provincial and district TB control activities are&#13;
conducted in the respective hospitals where TB patients are diagnosed and treated. Some&#13;
provincial supervisors may be members of the provincial hygiene station under the direction&#13;
of the provincial director for public health, others are employees of the provincial hospital&#13;
without direct connections with the hygiene station. Supervision from the provincial level&#13;
down, government programs for patient feeding, and general hospitalization and staffing&#13;
costs are borne by provincial governments. CENAT does not include commune or village&#13;
level facilities.&#13;
3.    Patient Diagnosis and Treatment. Patients suspected of having TB are diagnosed at&#13;
hospitals within the CENAT system. If a patient suspected of having TB is seen outside the&#13;
system, i.e. at a commune clinic, a referral is made to a provincial or district hospital within&#13;
the system. Diagnosis is based upon unconcentrated sputum smears stained for acid-fast&#13;
bacilli (AFB) at each treatment facility. Patients with negative sputum AFB smears undergo&#13;
a series of clinical evaluations over six weeks for the diagnosis of AFB smear negative TB.&#13;
The treatment of TB consists of multiple antibiotics given concurrently for 8 to 12 months.&#13;
Several regimens are used, incorporating all or some of the antibiotics streptomycin,&#13;
pyrazinamide, rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol. Drug requirements are calculated on a&#13;
quarterly basis at all treatment facilities based upon registry tabulations and passed to the&#13;
central office. These requests are then shared with the Central Medical Stores (CMS) in the&#13;
Ministry of Health which in turn is responsible for the acquisition and distribution of drugs&#13;
for the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -                              Annex 1&#13;
4.    An intensive phas of treatment, lasting the first two or three months depending on&#13;
the regimen used, is directly observed and is almost always completed on an in-patient basis.&#13;
If ambulatory care is offered during the intensive phase, then the patient must make daily&#13;
visits to the hospital for supervised therapy. The continuation phase of therapy is done on an&#13;
ambulatory basis with the patients given monthly supplies of medications. No formal&#13;
outreach activities are included in the NTP at this time.&#13;
5.    Food supplements in the form of rice, oil, fish and protein biscuits are provided to the&#13;
patients on a daily basis while in the hospital, and on a monthly basis as an out-patient. The&#13;
food program has been credited with enabling the patients to remain in the hospital through&#13;
the intensive phase of therapy and acting as an incentive for completing their therapy as an&#13;
out-patient.&#13;
6.    Training and Supervision. An extensive training program has been established to&#13;
implement the recent changes in the TB control program. In addition, ongoing training for&#13;
microscopists is conducted to maintain competency of AFB smear reading in the field. A&#13;
five day course is required for participants in the new program covering the theoretical&#13;
groundwork for short course chemotherapy, the use of the short course antibiotic regimen,&#13;
the new registries and cohort analysis. The seminar is followed by a field visit by the&#13;
training team to the hospital from which the seminar participants work. In addition, a bi-&#13;
annual meeting of participants is held to present the results of hospital experience and&#13;
program analyses.&#13;
7.    The NTP has had the benefit of a long-term advisor from the WHO for program&#13;
development and implementation. A three tiered supervisory system is established with the&#13;
central office overseeing the provincial offices and the provincial office overseeing the&#13;
district offices. Regular supervisory visits are scheduled at the central and provincial level on&#13;
a monthly basis. Tabulation of TB registry information and cohort analysis is conducted at&#13;
all levels, with the information collected by provincial supervisors and passed on to the&#13;
central office.&#13;
8.    Laboratory Services. In addition to a simple microscopy laboratory at each treatment&#13;
facility, CENAT includes a reference mycobacteriology laboratory. The facility is currently&#13;
being renovated in order to culture for M tuberculosis and to perform identification and&#13;
susceptibility testing. There are two long-term laboratory consultants, one supervisor, and 12&#13;
technicians working at the facility. This team is responsible for the training of all AFB smear&#13;
laboratory technicians, the preparation of AFB staining supplies for the country, the quality&#13;
control of AFB slide staining and interpretation in all of approximately 150 laboratories, and&#13;
the conduct of future M tuberculosis drug-resistance surveys.&#13;
9.    Program Evaluation and Surveys. Quarterly cohort analysis of TB patients is an&#13;
integral part of the program. Indicators included in the analysis include: number of new&#13;
cases and treatment regimens used, number and proportion of patients completing therapy,&#13;
number and proportion of patients confirmed cured by sputum microscopy, number of&#13;
patients who died, number of patients who defaulted from therapy, and the number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I-43-                                Annex 1&#13;
patients who transferred to another treatment facility. These results are compiled and&#13;
computerized at the central office and shared with all supervisors at the bi-annual TB&#13;
supervisors meetings.&#13;
10.   Several surveys are built into the program, including an initial TB prevalence survey,&#13;
tuberculin skin test surveys to be conducted every five years, and M tuberculosis drug-&#13;
resistance and HIV infection prevalence surveys yearly.&#13;
II. Program Function and Implementation&#13;
11.   The NTP is well founded in internationally accepted concepts of TB control in low&#13;
income countries. Given the combination of the extraordinary burden of tuberculosis in the&#13;
population, coupled with the proven efficacy of well implemented TB control, the NTP has&#13;
the potential to greatly impact the future health of Cambodians. CENAT has been able to&#13;
implement the new NTP with an impressive agenda starting in 1994. Implementation&#13;
consists of training and support of hospitals with sufficient staff and facilities to carry out the&#13;
program. Identified staff are trained in Phnom Penh in a five day seminar. After the initial&#13;
training, a team from the CENAT central office visits the facility to help organize pharmacy,&#13;
ward, record, and supervision procedures. For district facilities not yet trained or unable to&#13;
participate in the new program, the old, more simplified program continues. The old&#13;
program does not use the short course antibiotic regimen with its combination drugs and does&#13;
not contain the records necessary for quarterly cohort analysis. Thus, program indicators&#13;
such as the proportion of cases confirmed cured are not known for facilities using the old&#13;
system. But the new program is expanding rapidly and 100% coverage is planned by the end&#13;
of 1996. However, the program is still fragile and its capacity is strained. Human resources&#13;
are short, especially for skilled administrative personnel. None of the staff work full-time&#13;
and absenteeism is a problem. The central office is dependent on 12 key people for its&#13;
function, including direct training and supervision responsibilities. In the provinces and&#13;
districts, staff turnover has been problematic, requiring frequent training of new personnel.&#13;
12.   The program has heavily depended on outside donor support, especially for drugs and&#13;
training and supervision activities, and lack of future support lies in the path of increasing&#13;
program needs. The patient load may increase by 50 percent within the next 5 years,&#13;
requiring an increase in most every capacity and supply during that time. However, with&#13;
comprehensive financing of the components outlined below, along with the support provided&#13;
by the health systems strengthening, CENAT should be able to accommodate the expansion&#13;
of this program projected to the year 2000.&#13;
13.   Under health systems strengthening, facilities will be refurbished, upgraded or built&#13;
anew. These facilities should be incorporated into the new NTP as efficiently as possible.&#13;
Therefore, CENAT staff will be included in the effort to organize and start new facility&#13;
functions. Refurbished buildings and new equipment and supplies will allow district&#13;
facilities which could not support the new NTP in the past to become part of the program&#13;
with the necessary training. Thus, with the upgrade and expansion of old facilities and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-                               Annex I&#13;
construction of new facilities, the NTP will be able to expand to meet the goals of the&#13;
program and the needs of the people.&#13;
III. Component Description and Financing Needs&#13;
14.   The financing plan is based upon continuing the current program strategy, including&#13;
feeding and housing of tuberculosis patients in hospitals for the intensive phase of therapy&#13;
(two months) and feeding patients during therapy as an out-patient.&#13;
15.   The number of patients projected for the five year period of the project are based on&#13;
the epidemiologic assumptions previously detailed. The number of cases treated in the years&#13;
1993 to 1995 has increased 13, 000 per year. Projected case numbers for this project are&#13;
based on continuing an 8 to 10 percent increase in the first three years, thereafter leveling off&#13;
at 24,000 cases by the year 2000. Thus, with rounding, the five year projection of case&#13;
numbers would is as follows:&#13;
YEAR         1996        1997        1998         1999        2000&#13;
CASES       18,000      19,500       21,500      23,000      24,000&#13;
16.   Calculations for the proposed financing are based upon these projections. The supply&#13;
of drugs to the TB program is budgeted under essential drugs in the health systems&#13;
strengthening component of the project. Acquisitions will be made through the Central&#13;
Medical Stores (CMS) of the Ministry of Health. Distribution of drugs will proceed&#13;
according to requests processed by CENAT and passed on to CMS.&#13;
&#13;

I. National Bednet Program&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
1.   In support of the overall Malaria Program Goal - to reduce malaria mortality and&#13;
morbidity to the extent that malaria is no longer a major disease problem in Cambodia - the&#13;
national bednet program objectives are:&#13;
(a)   Expansion of and evaluation of insecticide-treated bednets projects, including&#13;
complete coverage of the population at risk in Kg. Cham and Kg. Speu in&#13;
1995-1997, with expansion to 19 other provinces in 1996-2000.&#13;
(b)   Development of social marketing strategies for reaching transient forest&#13;
workers and other population groups in collaboration with NGOs, to begin in&#13;
1995 and increase yearly through 2000.&#13;
B. Structure and Management&#13;
Central Level&#13;
2.    The National Bednet Program is managed at the central level by the National Malaria&#13;
Center (CNM). A Bednet Project Coordinator has been contracted for the duration of the&#13;
project by the Director of CNM, financed by ODA.  The Bednet Coordinator, in&#13;
collaboration with CNM staff and with technical support from a full time WHO&#13;
Malariologist, is responsible for planning, organizing and managing program implementation&#13;
and program evaluation.&#13;
3.    The health education, laboratory, epidemiology, entomology and parasitology units&#13;
within CNM provide technical supervision and support for the implementation of the&#13;
National Bednet Program. The health education unit is currently running health education&#13;
activities in Kg. Chain and Kg. Speu in support of bednet distribution in April 1995. The&#13;
laboratory unit conducts blood surveys as part of program evaluation as well as providing&#13;
technical supervision for routine blood slide surveillance services at provincial and some&#13;
district hospitals. The epidemiology unit provides HIS and census data for planning&#13;
purposes. The entomology and parasitology units are involved in surveillance activities (e.g.&#13;
drug and insecticide sensitivity studies and program evaluation).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -                             Annex 2&#13;
4.   It is proposed that a National Bednet Steering Committee is established with&#13;
representatives from CNM, WHO, donor agencies, NGOs, social marketing and, where&#13;
feasible, provincial malaria supervisors. The committee will be responsible for defining&#13;
policy, for planning, coordinating and standard setting for project implementation, for&#13;
program evaluation and for identifying resource requirements. The committee will be&#13;
established end 1 995/early 1996, meeting on a fairly frequent basis during the early phases of&#13;
program implementation, and biannually thereafter.&#13;

a Malaria Supervisor for all the rubber plantations in the country. The Malaria Supervisors&#13;
are usually attached to the Provincial Hygiene and Epidemiology Station, together with one&#13;
or two microscopists.&#13;
6.    Key duties and functions for the bednet program will be preparation of annual plans&#13;
in consultation with the districts, training and technical support to the districts, storage of&#13;
nets, distribution of nets to the districts, management of the operations budget, preparation of&#13;
progress reports (submitted to CNM) and program evaluation.&#13;

will also be expected to follow-up net distribution with household visits to determine&#13;
acceptance and compliance in the target population.&#13;
8.    Funds for implementation of the national Bednet Program will be provided by the&#13;
Provincial Health Team on a periodic basis, according to planned activities as reflected in the&#13;
district annual plans. The districts will provide quarterly progress reports to the Provincial&#13;
Health Teams with the focus on operational issues, particularly constraints, and will&#13;
participate in annual review meetings at the province.&#13;

II. Program Strategies &amp; Options for Cost Recovery&#13;
10.   The national bednet program will adopt two approaches for the distribution and&#13;
treatment of nets - a public sector health service strategy and a private sector social marketing&#13;
strategy - each of which offers a set of advantages over the other. The public sector approach&#13;
will: (a) ensure equity and access by the majority of the poor rural population; and&#13;
(b) achieve high coverage thereby reducing malaria transmission. The social marketing&#13;
approach has the advantages of: (a) creating high levels of demand, regardless of disposable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                              Annex 2&#13;
income levels, through mass media campaigns; (b) catering for specific sub-groups of the&#13;
population which are less accessible e.g. forest workers; and (c) providing better options for&#13;
cost recovery.&#13;
11.   Both sectors will be represented in a national Bednet Steering Committee, which will&#13;
serve a number of purposes including: (a) to define and agree on policy; (b) to ensure&#13;
standardization and quality control of bednet services, particularly in the private sector; and&#13;
(c) to provide guidance on program evaluation.&#13;
A. Cost Recovery - Public Sector&#13;
12.   As an intervention in support of public good, bednet use has a strong rationale for&#13;
public subsidy. The objective of cost recovery here will be an attempt to promote better&#13;
utilization of nets at household level based on the logic described earlier - that nets with a&#13;
cost attached to them will be better 'valued' by the buyer, and consequently used and cared&#13;
for correctly.&#13;
13.   There are several options for the flow of funds generated from net fees through the&#13;
public sector distribution program. Revenue from the sale of nets can (a) be used to&#13;
strengthen health services at the commune level, e.g. for renovations, supplementary drugs&#13;
and/or services; (b) be retained in the community to support community-managed health&#13;
and/or development projects; (c) used to strengthen district health services, e.g. provision of&#13;
mobile outreach services.&#13;
14.   The choice of one of these options will very much depend on capacity for financial&#13;
management (structures or intermediaries) at the village level, which will undoubtedly vary&#13;
from place to place, and it may be worthwhile to pilot cost recovery schemes in communities&#13;
with well-established infrastructure. Health staff should begin a dialogue with community&#13;
committees and associations in target communes well before distribution takes place, so that&#13;
commune leaders, committee members and other community leaders can meet to decide on&#13;
how to spend revenue generated from net sales in their commune/village. The bednet&#13;
committees and community leaders should be given the responsibility for organizing public&#13;
forums to create awareness about the distribution program, the 'net fund', and proposed uses&#13;
of the fund.&#13;
B. Cost Recovery - Social Marketing&#13;
15.   The private sector/social marketing approach provides several options for cost&#13;
recovery, two of which are considered here - distribution through private retailers and&#13;
distribution through organizations such as NGOs, rubber plantation companies and the&#13;
military service.&#13;
16.   Nets and insecticide will be provided through the Ministry of Health's national&#13;
program and sold at or below cost to private retail outlets and distributors, NGOs and other&#13;
large institutions and/or companies. Nets will be sold through these outlets at a mark-up&#13;
price in order to cover overheads and provide a profit margin. The outlets then buy more nets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-                                 Anex 2&#13;
from the social marketing agency once their stocks are depleted. In principle this approach&#13;
should provide a high level of cost recovery, depending on the willingness to pay of target&#13;
populations. However, complete cost recovery is impossible due to costs incurred by the&#13;
agency, including: (a) cost of the initial 'seed' supply of nets; (b) cost of the social marketing&#13;
campaign; (c) running costs; and (d) lower than market prices to assure high retail sales to&#13;
target groups. The social marketing program will therefore require significant donor subsidy.&#13;
C. Rubber Plantations and the Military Service&#13;
17.   Workers on the rubber plantations and the army are particularly at risk from malaria.&#13;
Estimates of bed occupancy rates by soldiers in hospitals around the country exceed 50&#13;
percent in general wards.  Rubber plantation managers report they have to provide&#13;
supplementary curative services (in the form of mobile clinics) for their workers and their&#13;
families during periods of heavy malaria transmission.&#13;
18.   The full impact of malaria on the rubber plantation companies in economic terms has&#13;
yet to be determined but is likely to be considerable due to both loss of productivity and the&#13;
cost of providing extensive curative services for workers and their families. Nevertheless the&#13;
biggest burden of malaria is at the household level, where family income is almost entirely&#13;
generated from work in the plantations. Loss of earnings by workers through illness is&#13;
exacerbated by significant, often crippling, expenditure on curative care both for themselves&#13;
as well as their families. Death is also not uncommon.&#13;
19.   There is need for dialogue between CNM/Ministry of Health, the military service and&#13;
the rubber plantation companies to develop a mutually agreeable strategy for bednet&#13;
distribution and treatment services for soldiers and workers (and their families) respectively.&#13;
The strategy should provide for a cost recovery component, preferably with a high degree of&#13;
subsidy by the employer. This strategy has the added advantage that employers can use a&#13;
'direct debit' approach for recovering net fees by deducting fees from salaries, with the option&#13;
of payment in installments.&#13;
III. Project Support to the National Bednet Program&#13;
A. Social Marketing&#13;
20.   An international non-profit organization will be contracted to develop a social&#13;
marketing strategy suitable to the Cambodian situation. The first requirement is a detailed&#13;
market survey, the findings of which will determine the feasibility and level of support&#13;
required to implement a social marketing bednet distribution and retreatment program in&#13;
Cambodia. This study was completed in April 1996 and its findings incorporated into the&#13;
appraisal of the project. Feasibility was judged to be high. The TOR for a two year first&#13;
phase implementation were prepared and agreed.&#13;
21.   The social marketing component will utilize existing private sector resources, such as&#13;
distributors, retailers and advertising agencies, to sell a branded insecticide-treated bednet&#13;
product. Nets provided through the program (in the first four years; perhaps thereafter from&#13;
&#13;

wholesalers) will be repacked with an appealing package and image, and sold to retailers and&#13;
distributors at a subsidized price. The retailers and distributors will in turn sell the brand-&#13;
name bednets at a mark-up price to cover overheads. If sales are successful, the retailer buys&#13;
more nets from the project and the cycle continues. Implicit in the project is the need to&#13;
control the mark-up price, the modalities of which must be determined prior to project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
22.   Demand creation activities for nets and retreatment will be implemented alongside&#13;
sale and distribution. Information on affordability, access and KAP from the market survey&#13;
will be used to formulate appropriate information, education and communication (IEC)&#13;
strategies and for specific target groups. In addition to creating demand for brand-name nets,&#13;
it is anticipated that the IEC strategy developed by the social marketing project will also&#13;
increase demand for insecticide-treated bednets provided through the public sector program.&#13;
B. Health Education and Social Mobilization&#13;
23.   The health education unit at CNM has already developed a number of IEC materials&#13;
which include insecticide-treated bednets as a component of malaria control strategies&#13;
suitable for community participation. Support will be provided for printing and reproduction&#13;
of existing materials, as well as a limited operational budget for implementation. In addition&#13;
to education of the general population, traditional healers, health activists and TBAs will be&#13;
targeted through local workshops run by district and commune health staff. Community&#13;
mobilization for bednet distribution and retreatment will be the responsibility of provincial&#13;
governors, community leaders, health workers at provincial, district and commune levels,&#13;
NGO personnel and employers. Mobilization campaigns should be conducted prior to net&#13;
distribution and every six months thereafter, prior to retreatment exercises.&#13;
C. Training&#13;
24.   CNM will be responsible for training all personnel involved in bednet distribution and&#13;
treatment - health staff, NGO employees, managers of the social marketing project, managers&#13;
of the rubber plantations, villagers etc. This is critical to ensuring standardization and quality&#13;
control of bednet services. WHO has provided TA for a period of four months for training of&#13;
CNM staff in insecticide-treated bednet technology and associated methodologies (e.g.&#13;
method for collective dipping, bioassays, insecticide sensitivity assays).&#13;
25.   In-service training will be required at all levels of the health service - at national,&#13;
provincial, district and commune levels - to ensure the delivery of quality services. A pre-&#13;
requisite to training will involve an assessment of the training needs at each level, preferably&#13;
during the planning session with provincial health management teams.&#13;
&#13;

D. Logistics&#13;
Procurement and Distribution&#13;
26.   Nets and insecticide will be procured by CNM using MOH procurement services and&#13;
delivered to the Central Medical Store of the MOH for storage and subsequent distribution to&#13;
the provinces. Procurement will take place on an annual basis in the second quarter [to allow&#13;
six months lead time], based on planning estimates. A request can be made to the supplier&#13;
for delivery in two or more installments, to reduce the amount of storage required at CMS.&#13;
After the first year, annual requirements can be revised according to the pace of&#13;
implementation in the previous year.&#13;
27.   Distribution to the provinces will follow the implementation schedule outlined in the&#13;
Project Implementation Plan and a limited number of provinces, grouped into five 'regions'&#13;
(Northwest, Central, Southwest, Southeast and Northeast), will implement the program each&#13;
year. This is expected to simplify logistics and facilitate the distribution process. CMS will&#13;
use the same distribution channels as currently used for drugs, immunization supplies and&#13;
equipment.&#13;
28.   The provinces will provide temporary storage for nets and deliver them to the districts&#13;
as scheduled in the provincial plan of action. Districts will then be required to store nets and&#13;
insecticide for a brief period, until they are delivered to the community level. Health centers&#13;
are not expected to handle supplies.&#13;
Transport&#13;
29.   The Central Medical Store of the MOH will have five trucks suitable for the&#13;
distribution of bednets and insecticide from Phnom Penh to the provinces. Additional&#13;
transport can be sought from private companies at reasonable rates. For purposes of&#13;
transportation from provincial headquarters to the districts, malaria supervisors will rely on&#13;
common-use MOH transport and NGOs.&#13;
Supplies and Equipment&#13;
30.   Supplies and equipment required for the bednet program include nets, insecticide,&#13;
plastic buckets, gloves, measuring cylinders, bioassay kits, insecticide sensitivity kits,&#13;
equipment for blood surveys and vehicles.&#13;
&#13;

DISEASE CONTROL AND HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
HIV/AIDS COMPONENT: MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1.    The detailed project description and budget is found in the Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(PIP). The following items reflect subjects of particular interest in relation to the management&#13;
and implementation of the HIV/AIDS component.&#13;
Organization and Management of the Government's response to the Epidemic&#13;
2.    The Government's response to the epidemic is anchored in the National AIDS Office&#13;
(NAO) which was established in 1993. The position of this office within the MOH has not been&#13;
clear, but to rectify this situation, a condition of the credit will be to upgrade the office to the&#13;
level of department through appointing an administrator and financial officer. The relationship&#13;
between the NAO and the Institute of Dermatology and Venereology has also required&#13;
clarification, but a decision has been reached that the Institute will fall under the NAO as its&#13;
primary function relates to the STD program.&#13;
3.    Policy guidance and interministerial coordination is conducted through the National&#13;
Committee on HIV/AIDS/STD which is chaired by the Minister of Health. The First Prime&#13;
Minister is the honorary chairman of this committee which meets irregularly and infrequently.&#13;
There is no representation of the NGO community on the committee which, otherwise, broadly&#13;
reflects those ministries with an interest in the epidemic. The national committee acts as a forum&#13;
for discussion but it makes no decisions about resources and how those should be expended&#13;
across ministries. The National AIDS Office at the MOH acts as the -secretariat for the national&#13;
committee.&#13;
4.    Earlier, there was an intent to establish a secretariat and a technical committee to assist&#13;
advising the national program. In reality, the so called secretariat was another committee but&#13;
comprised of lower level staff from across the concerned ministries. The technical committee&#13;
meets infrequently.&#13;
5.    The issues related to the Government's organization of its response were discussed at a&#13;
World Bank/UNDP/WHO sponsored workshop conducted on August 17, 1995. While there was&#13;
no immediate outcome, what has emerged is that the National AIDS Office in will become&#13;
known as the National HIV/AIDS/STD Secretariat obviating the proposed "secretariat&#13;
committee". The technical committee will serve the HIV/AIDS/STD Secretariat.&#13;
6.    Currently, the whole Government's response to the epidemic is conducted through and by&#13;
the Ministry of Health. Therefore, the Project will make available its resources through the&#13;
MOH and the HIV/AIDS/STD Secretariat.&#13;

8.      Within the National AIDS office, units have been established to be responsible for&#13;
specific functions of the NAO. The STD management unit will be responsible for the specialized&#13;
programs at the STD center and for the introduction of the syndromic approach to the diagnosis&#13;
and management of STDs in the health care delivery system. Administering the  Small Grants&#13;
Fund  for NGO  activities and responsibility for the National Committee for HIV/AIDS/STD&#13;
Prevention and Control will rest with the Grants Fund Unit. An IEC unit, managed by a media&#13;
director to be specifically recruited for this purpose, will orchestrate the public information&#13;
campaigns to be developed and launched through the project. The Outreach Program will&#13;
continue to receive direction and support from the unit already established for this purpose. All&#13;
surveillance and evaluation activities will be managed by a specific unit for this purpose. Human&#13;
resource development will be the responsibility of the training unit which will need to coordinate&#13;
closely with more specialized units which have specialized staff development responsibilities.&#13;
Finally, the administration and finance unit will provide the services necessary to ensure the&#13;
smooth functioning of the NAO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

9.    The majority of the Provincial AIDS Offices (PAO) have a complement of five staff&#13;
although a few smaller provinces only have three. The PAOs are technically under the direction&#13;
of the NAO. The outreach and STD programs in each province are under the direction of&#13;
assigned staff at the provincial office with the responsibility for fostering and managing the&#13;
outreach program, currently mainly aimed at prostitutes, and managing the introduction of the&#13;
syndromic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of STDs. Involvement in the epidemiological&#13;
and other survey activities will form part of PAO work programs as well as organizing training&#13;
activities at provincial level on a variety of themes including counseling.&#13;
10.   The National Blood Transfusion Center (NBTC) is responsible for organizing and&#13;
directing the country's blood transfusion services. The Director of the NBTC reports to the&#13;
MOH.&#13;
Small Grants Fund for NGOs&#13;
11.   The significance of the role of the NGO sector in the response within the country so far&#13;
cannot be over estimated, from the successful social marketing of condoms to preparing&#13;
informational materials to working directly with high risk groups. The Government recognizes&#13;
that synergy between the government and non-government sector is important for the country's&#13;
effort to contain the epidemic.&#13;
12.  In recognition of the continued importance of NGO efforts, under this project, a fund will&#13;
be established to provide small grants for the NGO sector. The fund will work in two ways,&#13;
responding to proposals submitted by NGOs and proposing activities to the NGO sector which&#13;
they are best able to conduct. The fund is expected to contribute to attainment of government&#13;
policy and priorities in relation to the epidemic. The following lays out the mechanism by which&#13;
the fund will operate.&#13;
NATIONAL AIDS OFFICE - NGO SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM&#13;
National AIDS Program&#13;
13.   The National AIDS Program is a coordinated effort by the Royal Government of&#13;
Cambodia to address the increasing presence of HIV within the country. The program will&#13;
receive assistance from the World Bank through the Disease Control and Health Development&#13;
Project and through other multilateral and bilateral support.&#13;
14.   The role of the NGO community in dealing with the prevention of the further spread of&#13;
HIV in Cambodia is well known and documented. The synergy between the Government's&#13;
program and those of the NGO community needs to be enhanced, each recognizing the relative&#13;
strengths and merits of their activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55-                               Annex 3&#13;
Small Grants Program&#13;
15.   The Small Grants program, set up under this project, will award grants to NGOs and&#13;
other community groups for small-scale projects and activities that address HIV/AIDS issues.&#13;
The principal objective of the programn is to facilitate and carry out innovative activities to further&#13;
limit the spread of the HIV virus. Such activities may be proposed by the NGO conmmunity or&#13;
proposed to them by the National AIDS Program.&#13;
16.   Under this program, grants will be provided directly to NGOs and community groups to&#13;
carry out specific projects and activities which fall within the overall strategy of containing the&#13;
HIV epidemic. Grants will be made after evaluating proposals received from NGOs and&#13;
community groups by the Project Grant Committee on an open and competitive basis. Grants&#13;
will only be made to organizations and not to individuals. Such organizations must be&#13;
organically and functionally outside the formal Government structure. The foregoing committee&#13;
will administer the program.&#13;
Project Grant Committee&#13;
17.   The committee will consist of  the Director of the National AIDS Program, a&#13;
representative of UNAIDS Theme Group, a representative of the World Bank's Project&#13;
Operation Unit, a representative of a Khmer NGO and a representative of an International NGO.&#13;
In the latter two cases, the organizations represented will be those substantially dedicated to&#13;
addressing the HIV/AIDS issue in Cambodia. The responsibility for selection of representatives&#13;
from the Khmer and International NGO community will rest with the NGO HIV/AIDS&#13;
Coordinating Committee.&#13;
18.   The chairperson of the committee will be the Director of the National AIDS Program or&#13;
his/her designee.  The chairperson will organize the committee in consultation with the&#13;
concerned parties and will be responsible for all committee meetings whose frequency will be at&#13;
his/her discretion. The presence of three members will represent a quorum.&#13;
19.   Responsibility for administering the approved projects, including disbursements, and for&#13;
the preparation and submission of reports will rest with the staff of the National AIDS&#13;
Secretariat.&#13;
The terms of reference for the committee will be to:&#13;
(i)  Promote the NGO Grant program;&#13;
(ii) Select and approve project proposals submitted to the committee;&#13;
(iii) Review progress reports of projects; and&#13;
(iv) Review and approve project completion reports for submission to the World Bank's&#13;
PCU and other concerned entities.&#13;
Application Eligibility&#13;
20.   Whatever the type of organization, certain basic requirements need to be fulfilled as part&#13;
of the selection criteria and include the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                              Annex 3&#13;
(i)  A basic organizational structure or constitution;&#13;
(ii)  At least two years experience in relevant fields of activity;&#13;
(iii) Some demonstrated capacity in project management, reporting and accounting;&#13;
(iv) Adequate coverage in clientele and geographic terms;&#13;
(v)  Some form of registration either with a Government institution or an NGO network, to&#13;
establish both authenticity and accountability; and&#13;
(vi) A statement of financial accounts for the previous year, to indicate the ability to manage&#13;
project money.&#13;
21.   Information on the above and other aspects of organizational history and strength will be&#13;
asked for in the standard project proposal format which must be filled in by all parties applying&#13;
for grants. If there is uncertainty whether an organization is eligible to apply for a grant,&#13;
clarification may be sought from the Project Grant Committee.&#13;
Type of Project Activities to be Supported&#13;
22.   Grants will be awarded to innovative preventive activities, with a focus on populations&#13;
particularly vulnerable to the impact of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV. For the target&#13;
populations, areas of interest include, but are not limited to:&#13;
(i)  Peer education programs for target populations;&#13;
(ii)  Participatory and innovative workshops;&#13;
(iii) Information, Communication and Education;&#13;
(iv) Advocacy; and&#13;
(v)  Specialized studies and research framed in a social and gender context.&#13;
Duration of Grants&#13;
23.   Grants will initially be made to support project activities with a 12 month or less time&#13;
frame. However, prospective applicants are encouraged to submit project plans covering a 2-3&#13;
year period. It is possible that follow-up grants may be made based on performance, at a later&#13;
stage.&#13;
Nature of Grants&#13;
24.   Initially, the range for an individual grant will be up to US$25,000 equivalent. However,&#13;
the actual size of grant will be determined depending on specific project requirements and the&#13;
absorption capacity of the group concerned. The grants will be made in US$ riel equivalents&#13;
based on budget estimates submitted with project proposals.&#13;
25.   It is expected that the grants will be made in installments. The final installment will be&#13;
made on satisfactory completion of the activity and the receipt of a final report. Funding can be&#13;
provided for both new programs and for continuing existing activities. Co-funding of activities&#13;
may be considered when appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57 -                              Annex 3&#13;
26.   Funding will not be available for construction and other infrastructure development&#13;
activities nor for the purchase of vehicles. The cost of project related transport may be included&#13;
in the budget estimate submitted with the project proposal. Limited budget support can be&#13;
provided, if critical need is established, for the acquisition of items of office equipment if the cost&#13;
does not exceed 30 percent of the total budget estimate for the project. Staff salaries may also be&#13;
supported either on a partial or full basis for the duration of the project, but such support should&#13;
be clearly indicated in the proposal submission.&#13;
27.   Money allocated for the activities described in the project proposal cannot be assigned by&#13;
the grantee for other purposes if it is greater than five percent of the total budget without prior&#13;
approval from the Small Grants Program Approval Committee.&#13;
28.   The grantee organization may propose to charge, in the budget estimate, an amount not to&#13;
exceed 15 percent of total project budget for administrative overheads and such other expenses.&#13;
29.   Each organization is expected to indicate what counterpart contributions it can make to&#13;
projects over and above the grant from the program. This might include voluntary services and&#13;
time on part of members of the organization, use of premises and equipment, mobilization of&#13;
voluntary technical advice from competent sources and co-financing from the organization's&#13;
other funds. The amount of counterpart funds, which should represent a minimum of five&#13;
precent of the total project budget, will be reviewed during project assessment, although the&#13;
magnitude of those contributions will not, in itself, be a key determinant.&#13;
Submission of Proposals&#13;
30.   All project proposals should be developed according to the prescribed project format&#13;
copies of which are freely available at the National AIDS Office and the Project Coordination&#13;
Unit. The proposals may be submitted in Khmer with an English translation or in English. They&#13;
should be submitted to the Director of the National AIDS Office at the Ministry of Health for the&#13;
attention of the Project Grant Committee. Submissions will be accepted twice yearly.&#13;
31.   Applicants whose proposals are selected for funding will be asked to enter into a&#13;
"Memorandum of Agreement" which will outline the nature of the project, duration, amount&#13;
granted and other arrangements such as for reporting.&#13;
Proposal Format&#13;
32.   Each submission is expected to adopt the following format and to be no longer than three&#13;
pages:&#13;
(i)  Name of Organization, list of principal officers and contact information;&#13;
(ii) Brief background about the organization including background and experience of key&#13;
people;&#13;
(iii) Proposal indicating rationale, objectives and implementation schedule; and&#13;
(iv) Budget - costs of personnel, project (travel, activities, communication), materials and&#13;
overhead.&#13;
&#13;

KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA&#13;
DISEASE CONTROL AND HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Health Services Strengthening - Provincial Selection and Phasing&#13;
National Health Coverage Support under the Project&#13;
1.   In order to achieve a rational allocation and utilization of resources at the operational&#13;
district level, the Government has developed a National Health Coverage Plan. Based on&#13;
discussions with the government, and in keeping with government policy, the project will&#13;
support the health coverage plan at the operational district level as a means to better deliver&#13;
primary health care and disease control programs at the community level. The plan attempts&#13;
to rationalize the provision of health facilities by changing the focus of the referral-peripheral&#13;
unit from being linked to an administrative unit of a district, to being linked to the population&#13;
size served (operational district). It aims at developing the physical infrastructure and human&#13;
resources in the health system based on a geographical and population basis. It defines the&#13;
catchment areas for each level of treatment and specifies the location of health facilities.&#13;
Workshops were held with representation from provincial and district health authorities,&#13;
NGOs and provincial health advisors. The decisions emerging from these workshops have&#13;
been used as the basis for defining the needs of operational districts in terms of facilities,&#13;
equipment and drugs.&#13;
Determination of Province Selection and Phasing&#13;
2.    The project will support the Government's National Health Coverage Plan by&#13;
providing basic health services strengthening at the health center and referral hospital level.&#13;
All provinces in the country have conducted a mapping exercise to determine the location of&#13;
the health facilities under the coverage plan. Government also held a series -of provincial&#13;
workshops in which provincial and district authorities reconciled the population-based&#13;
numbers of health centers and referral hospitals to reflect the mapping exercise and needs of&#13;
the operational district. The health facilities that would be upgraded/newly constructed and&#13;
equipped under the project was determined using the provincial numbers of health centers&#13;
and referral hospitals that emerged from the discussions as the basis.&#13;
3.   In order to determine the provinces that would be included during the time frame of&#13;
the project, the following criteria were used:&#13;
(a)   Exclusion of ADB assisted provinces - K.Cham, K. Chhnang, Takeo, Svey&#13;
Reng and Prey Veng)&#13;
(b)   Prevalence of disease - TB, and malaria (high is positive, low is negative; 2 =&#13;
tuberculosis and 2 = tuberculosis + malaria))&#13;

* shaded portion represents project period.&#13;
v  The numbersfor health centers that emergedfor 3 provincesfrom the health coverage plan workshops were&#13;
modifiedfor targeting under the project:&#13;
(a)    Battambang:  Given access considerations, though a total of 59 are to be&#13;
provided under the health coverage plan, 30 were targeted as realistic for the&#13;
project period.&#13;
(b)    Phnom  Penh:  Given the urban location of Phnom  Penh, and the greater&#13;
availability of both public and private health facilities, though the health&#13;
coverage plan estimates 39 health centers, the project would target 20 health&#13;
centers.&#13;
(c)    Siem  Reap: Given  access considerations, though a total of 57 are to be&#13;
provided under the health coverage plan, 28 were targeted as realistic for the&#13;
project period.&#13;
5.     The selection of health centers and referral hospitals for upgrading within each&#13;
province was based on the health coverage plan needs (determined by the provincial&#13;
workshops and mapping exercise described above) as well as phasing considerations taking&#13;
capacity (both staffing and managerial) into account.&#13;
6.     The project would therefore support upgrading and equipping of 230 Health Centers,&#13;
of which 173 would be new construction and 57 would be renovations (26 of the renovated&#13;
health centers would also have TB ward facilities). Existing district hospitals which are to be&#13;
converted into functioning health centers would be given priority for renovation purposes.&#13;

*  Given its urban location and the 7 national hospitals in Phnom Penh, no referral hospital in Phnom Penh&#13;
will be upgraded under the project.&#13;
7.     The project would support upgrading and equipping of 26 referral hospitals, of which&#13;
8 would be basic referral hospitals and 18 would be full referral hospitals. Of the 18 full&#13;
referral hospitals selected under the project, 3 would be major renovations and 15 would be&#13;
minor renovations. Of the eight basic referral hospitals, two would be major renovations and&#13;
six would be minor renovations.&#13;

DISEASE CONTROL AND HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Project Management Arrangements&#13;
I.    The Ministry of Health (MOH) will be the implementing agency for both the CDCP&#13;
and the ADB-assisted Basic Health Services Project (BHSP). A Steering Committee&#13;
consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MOEF), Ministry&#13;
of Planning (MOP), Cambodia Development Council (CDC) as well as senior MOH staff&#13;
will provide overall technical and managerial direction during project implementation.&#13;
2.    The central Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will manage the timely and efficient&#13;
implementation of the CDCP and BHSP, and activities common to both projects will be&#13;
financed jointly by the two projects (Finance and Administration Unit). In addition, activities&#13;
specific to each project will be managed by the respective sub-unit within the PCU. The PCU&#13;
will rely on the line departments in MOH (Planning and Statistics, Budgeting, Financial&#13;
Department, Director General of Health, etc.) and the national institutes (CENAT, CNM,&#13;
NAO) to provide technical guidance and supervision to the local implementation units in the&#13;
project provinces. Also, appropriate technical resources will be identified to form an&#13;
advisory group, for providing specialized inputs into the implementation process.&#13;
3.    The provincial health authorities will be responsible for the overall management and&#13;
supervision of project activities at the provincial level and will act as the link between the&#13;
central PCU/MOH and the operational district health system. A Provincial Project Unit&#13;
(PPU), headed by a Provincial Project Director, will be established in the ten provinces&#13;
receiving provincial inputs and will be responsible for project implementation at the&#13;
peripheral level.&#13;

KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA&#13;
DISEASE CONTROL AND HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Health Management Agreements (HMA)&#13;
1.    These are intended to be a jointly agreed and committed plan among the Ministry&#13;
of Health (MOH), provincial health management, and provincial civil administration (the&#13;
provincial governor's offices). They will agree to the substance of health inputs,&#13;
processes/ activities, and outputs as well as the processes of planning, organizing, and&#13;
managing health services, including how these Agreements themselves will function.&#13;
They will be planned in the context of 5-year goals and expected outcomes and long term&#13;
impacts.&#13;
2.    These Health Management Agreements (HMA) should become the basis for how&#13;
health is planned and managed. They should change the nature of the relationship&#13;
between the MOH and the Provinces. However, they are proposed, not for the sake of&#13;
change, but with a single overall purpose of improving performance of public sector&#13;
health services.&#13;
3.    The Agreements have the following characteristics. They will:&#13;
(a)   be formulated and agreed annually, but will have no legal status as such;&#13;
(b)   involve the following groups in the process' who will each sign the&#13;
agreement:&#13;
(i)   Provincial Governors' Office representatives;&#13;
(ii)   Provincial Health Directorate representatives;&#13;
(iii)  Ministry of Health [MOH] representatives; and&#13;
(iv)  the Project Coordination Unit [PCU].&#13;
(c)   usually be prepared in the Provinces during planning workshops;&#13;
(d)   define a planning, operating and monitoring/evaluation framework. This&#13;
may be done in project management software.  This will provide&#13;
consistency of various health functions [e.g. case management], and will&#13;
allow comparisons:&#13;
See draft example HMA format in the Project Implementation Plan for a more&#13;
detailed listing of all proposed organizational units who are likely to participate in the&#13;
process.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                          Annex 8&#13;
(i)   across programs; and&#13;
(ii)  across provinces;&#13;
(e)   specify responsibilities according to the major stages in operations -&#13;
inputs, activities, and process outputs;&#13;
(f)   have process outputs as the primary focus, which is a change from past&#13;
management focus which tends to focus on inputs and activities;&#13;
(g)   make a clearer division of labor and responsibilities so there is little doubt&#13;
who does what, not only between the Provinces and the MOH generally,&#13;
but among the organizational units within the MOH and Provinces which&#13;
may be expressed in sub-agreements annexed to the main Agreement;&#13;
(h)   have clear indicators of performance so that they are measurable and&#13;
objectively monitorable;&#13;
(i)   have clear performance consequences that are known to all parties in&#13;
advance that are clearly defined and categorized; and&#13;
(j)   remain flexible in their design and use - both the Agreement's content and&#13;
in the manner in which they are planned, implemented, and monitored.&#13;
4.    The content of these Agreements and the manner in which they will be&#13;
implemented was reviewed by a cross section of managers from all signatory parties.&#13;
This review culminated in a one-day Workshop during the pre-appraisal mission during&#13;
which all parties concluded that the Agreements were both desirable and feasible. They&#13;
should be tried during the first year of the Project with the Phase I provinces. This should&#13;
be considered a trial year. Full implementation will be only at the beginning of the&#13;
second project year. Therefore, there is some time to prepare the exact nature of the&#13;
Agreements and further orient managers to their use. Using these Agreements as the&#13;
"centerpiece" of managerial relationships requires:&#13;
(a)   majority of managers and staff contributing or expressing their views on&#13;
the changes;&#13;
(b)   improving overall performance of the MOH at any level, and improving&#13;
motivation and morale;&#13;
(c)   improving relationships with related public sector managers: e.g.&#13;
Governors, other Ministers, etc.&#13;
5.   In order for these Agreements to have a meaningful impact on public sector&#13;
performance, concurrent improvements in the following are also needed:&#13;
(a)   improving managers' knowledge and skills;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -                                Annex 8&#13;
(b)    changing  MOH   organization  structures  and  management  systems&#13;
including:&#13;
(i)    national MOH structure;&#13;
(ii)    provincial health  structures including  relationships with  the&#13;
governors' office;&#13;
(iii)   district health structures;&#13;
(iv)   related changes in responsibilities, authorities, and accountabilities;&#13;
(v)    a health information system  [HIS] to support actual decision&#13;
making&#13;
(vi)   resource  procurement and  distribution  including: drugs  and&#13;
supplies, equipment, transport, and facilities; and&#13;
(c)    improving staff technical knowledge and skills in order to be able to&#13;
deliver on the Agreements' commitments at reasonable quality levels.&#13;

7.    The HMA format will be a selection of indicators by input, by output, and&#13;
outcome; all of which will be attainable on an annual basis. The format must be&#13;
consistent across provinces. Part of the Agreement should also define the specific steps&#13;
in the process by which Agreements are planned, implemented, monitored, and evaluated&#13;
along with the consequences for good and poor performance [see Sections IV and V of&#13;
the HMA example in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) for details of what is&#13;
currently proposed]. These steps may be agreed only once at the beginning of the project&#13;
or they may be "re-agreed" each year. However this is done, the development and use of&#13;
these Agreements must relate to the total Government/MOH planning, implementing, and&#13;
monitoring/evaluation cycle.&#13;
8.    A format for district level planning is being developed by the MOH. This same&#13;
structure can and should be used at the provincial level so that district plans can be&#13;
aggregated into provincial plans. In order to ease the planning of repetitive tasks and&#13;
operations management/monitoring, it is suggested that all this information be entered in&#13;
project management software. The draft district planning format information can all be&#13;
accommodated in common project management software. This computer supported&#13;
planning and management can be done only at the provincial and national level (PCU)&#13;
until computers are provided to districts. This application can be one of the uses of the&#13;
computers the Project is providing to the provinces. The workplans generated by the&#13;
software can also be a formal part of the HMA process. They can be aggregated to form&#13;
the basis for the overall annual Project plan. The HMA system will be monitored from&#13;
the central MOH by the Provincial Project Unit, as well as the PCU, and should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -                          Annex 8&#13;
implemented in a phasing which is linked to the overall Disease Control and Health&#13;
Development project implementation and supervision.&#13;
9.    The completed provincial HMA can then be disaggregated into program/project&#13;
components and the parts given to the respective program managers. These would, at a&#13;
minimum, cover the health strengthening investments and the three disease control&#13;
programs, TB, malaria, and HIV/AIDS in a component-specific workplan. Those&#13;
workplans could be centrally aggregated by each program at the Ministry level to produce&#13;
a master workplan.&#13;
10.   While these are not contracts, in order to verify participation and agreement, the&#13;
HMAs should be signed by the major concerned parties - the provincial Governor or&#13;
his/her representative, MOH representative, the provincial health director, and the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit. The provincial health advisors (HAs) and donor organizations&#13;
assisting a given province should be included in the preparation of the annual plan and&#13;
subsequent HMA negotiations with the MOH. Other donors' specific inputs, activities,&#13;
and outputs may also eventually be included in the HMA later.&#13;
11.   The Agreement commits three parties - the MOH, the Provincial Governors&#13;
Office, and the Provincial Health Directorate - to a variety of actions and results. The&#13;
process of Agreement planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation will be given&#13;
primary support and supervision by the MOH's Provincial Coordination Section (PCS)&#13;
and secondary supervision by top management of the MOH, the Royal Government's&#13;
central agencies, and the donors, in particular the World Bank. [see Figure 8.3] This&#13;
indirect supervision will usually be carried out during missions coming at six monthly&#13;
intervals. The joint World Bank/ADB Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will assist PCS&#13;
in Agreement implementation, reporting progress, and problem identification/analyses for&#13;
these missions.&#13;

12.   If any party to this Agreement fails to satisfy their commitments, the parties will&#13;
meet to discuss the relevant issues and agree to steps to remove such constraints on&#13;
performance. As this is a new approach to program planning and management, and given&#13;
the status of Caembodias health delivery system, it is expected that there will be&#13;
adjustments in the HMA processes in the first one tNwo  years of implementation. In the&#13;
case  of severe  breach   of perfoatance  targets, and  the  inability  of 'second&#13;
level'management to resolve the issue, the issue may be taken  up to first level&#13;
management for decision.&#13;
13.   All parties have the right and obligation to assess whether they themselves and all&#13;
others are in or out of compliance with the Agreement. A case may be made at any time&#13;
if the situation seems especially serious, but generally these assessments will be made&#13;
during joint program/project supervision missions. No party will be expected to perforTn&#13;
at 100 percent for 100 percent of all the elements in their set of respective commitments.&#13;
However, generally the "80/80" rule should be the performance guideline. The "80/80"&#13;
rule implies good and acceptable performance is: 80 percent on-time/on-quantity/on-&#13;
quality performance for 80 percent of the elements within the HMA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-83 -                           Annex 8&#13;
14.   Nevertheless, judgments on compliance/out-of-compliance will need to take into&#13;
account unexpected factors for the first one to three years. Objective assessment of&#13;
performance would have to be based on objective information. The development of&#13;
monitoring and research systems with their requisite information systems, while generally&#13;
good in MOH, may not be operating at levels to produce valid and reliable information&#13;
before that time. Until that time, out-of-compliance will jointly be judged on the basis of&#13;
intent to perform according to the Agreement. That is, can a case be made that the&#13;
concerned party was genuinely trying to perform.&#13;
15.   If there is a dispute over performance and the indicators of the intent to perform,&#13;
the MOH PCS [with the support of the Project's PCU] will be the initial arbitrator of the&#13;
performance assessment. If the dispute can not be resolved at this level, then the matter&#13;
will be forwarded to the next formal Project supervision mission. The Bank and top&#13;
management of the MOH, [if necessary with the assistance of the Royal Government's&#13;
central agencies] will resolve the matter.&#13;
16.   Just as a judicial system  has various consequences for various acts; the&#13;
consequences of out-of compliance performance should follow a spectrum according to&#13;
the seriousness. Conversely performance above levels of commitment can result in&#13;
increased rewards and resources.&#13;

DISEASE CONTROL AND HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Project Performance Indicators&#13;
1.    The monitoring indicators for the Disease Control and Health Development Project&#13;
(CDCP) intend to capture the progress and impact of two different but related aspects of:&#13;
(a) IDA financing of specific inputs and activities as part of an integral project and (b) when&#13;
possible, the relationship- of IDA-financed inputs to the processes, outcome and impact&#13;
performance of the three national health programs being supported by the project.&#13;
2.    The indicators will be defined, measured and reported as part of a process that is linked&#13;
with the day-to-day details of Government's management and execution of the project and the&#13;
overall programs. The key indicators would provide signals of underlying processes and&#13;
determinants of project performance which are feasible to monitor during project&#13;
implementation. In addition to the overall project indicators, specific performance goals and&#13;
objectives will be negotiated and agreed to annually between the Ministry of Health and each of&#13;
the ten provinces supported by the project. The performance indicators will be included as part&#13;
of the Health Management Agreements. (see Annex 8, Health Management Agreements).&#13;
3.    The definition of indicators selected to monitor and evaluate overall project&#13;
implementation progress and results are described in Part A below. Part B provides the detailed,&#13;
specific list of input, outcome and impact indicators against which each of the project&#13;
components will be assessed.&#13;
A. Indicator Definition&#13;
4.    Loan Disbursement Rate (semi-annual; ITF-financing specific), defined as the cumulative&#13;
amount of project expenditures incurred by the Government and withdrawn from Loan proceeds&#13;
as a percentage of the total Loan amount. Actual disbursements would be measured against the&#13;
projected disbursement schedule (Annex 12)&#13;
5.    Project Milestones (annual; project-wide scope). Actual accomplishment of project&#13;
milestones would be measured against the agreed upon project implementation schedule.&#13;
Milestones would include the negotiating, signing, monitoring of the Health Management&#13;
Agreements with the 10 provinces, employment of consultants, delivery of key outputs,&#13;
completing planned training and IEC, establishment of the HIV grant program and others as&#13;
defined in the project implementation schedule (See Annex 13).&#13;

Project Inputs:&#13;
6.    The project can be considered a set of inputs (civil works, equipment, transportation,&#13;
drugs and supplies, training, technical assistance) designed to allow the desired program&#13;
activities (service delivery, institutional strengthening, research) to be undertaken in order to&#13;
achieve desired outcomes and impact. The performance indicators for input will determine if&#13;
they are adequate in quantity and timely in procurement.&#13;
7.    Input Accomplishment Rates (semi-annual; project-wide scope), defined as the&#13;
cumulative quantity of physical accomplishments attained by the project expressed as a&#13;
percentage of total physical targets. This would include facilities constructed or rehabilitated,&#13;
and equipment installed for the 10 targeted provinces. For drugs, the project will monitor&#13;
procurement and delivery according to the national drug procurement plan.   Actual&#13;
accomplishments would be measured against total project objectives for each of the 10 targeted&#13;
provinces and upon physical implementation schedules negotiated annually in the Health&#13;
Management Agreements.&#13;
Program and Project Outputs&#13;
8.    Program Delivery Accomplishment Rates (first, third and fifth year, program-wide) for&#13;
all three disease control programs, the project will monitor qualitative improvements in the case&#13;
management of the diseases by assessing provider performance against predefined clinical&#13;
standards. For TB, the project will monitor the total number of cases treated and cured. For&#13;
malaria, in addition to case management, the project will monitor program performance in the&#13;
distribution, household coverage and sale of bed nets to high risk populations and to the targeted&#13;
communes. The number of staff trained specifically in disease control protocols and procedures&#13;
will be monitored. For HIV/AIDS, the project will monitor the number and the value of NGO&#13;
grants, the number of TV and radio programs produced and other indicators as outlined below.&#13;
9.    Service Availability Indicators (first, third and fifth years of project; project-wide scope),&#13;
defined as the proportion of total public health facilities capable of delivering the minimum&#13;
package of services as defined in the Government's Health Coverage Plan (health centers and&#13;
referral hospitals). Capable of delivery is defined as having available in a referral hospital and&#13;
health center the physical facility, equipment, trained staff and supplies necessary to deliver the&#13;
minimum package of services defined in the Health Coverage Plan. It should be noted that the&#13;
range of services available in the coverage plan include but are not limited to the specific&#13;
services supported by the project, i.e. tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/STDs. Service availability&#13;
would be expressed in terms of the ratio of actual to expected new or rehabilitated facilities that&#13;
are capable of service delivery in each of the 10 provinces. A complete health facility and&#13;
equipment baseline survey is being conducted in the 10 project provinces and will be completed&#13;
by project appraisal.&#13;

Outcome/Impact&#13;
10.   Access to and Utilization of facility Indicators (first, third and fifth years of project;&#13;
project-wide scope), defined as the proportion of the population residing within a set distance in&#13;
terms of normal travel time of health centers and referral hospitals capable of delivering health&#13;
services (as defined in para. 9 above). Service access would be expressed as a proportion of the&#13;
population with access to service, and would be compared to a baseline determined at the start of&#13;
the project. Facility utilization would be monitored using two indices: (a) the number of clinic&#13;
or outpatient visits by facility; the first post rehabilitation year utilization figure will be&#13;
considered the baseline (b) trends in percent of hospital bed occupancy will be monitored .&#13;
11.   Risk Reduction Indicators (first, third and fifth years of project; program-wide scope).&#13;
The project objective is to assist the Government reduce the risk to the Cambodian population of&#13;
three priority health problems including: malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/STDs. The project will&#13;
seek to monitor how project inputs assist the national programs for Malaria, Tuberculosis and&#13;
HIV/STDs, achieve improvements in the national program outputs and impact through the&#13;
reduction in risk. The project will monitor case fatality and death rates, prevalence, and cure&#13;
rates for TB and Malaria.&#13;
12.   Malaria. Two sets of key indicators would be used to monitor the national program&#13;
progress in reducing the risk of malaria. First, the project will seek to assess reduction in case&#13;
fatality rates (case management) and second, assess the actual reduction in the incidence of&#13;
malaria among high risk individuals and populations (vector control and prevention).&#13;
13.   Monitoring improvements in case management, the project will, in addition to monitoring&#13;
the continuous supply of service inputs necessary for malaria case management (see para. 7.&#13;
above), conduct two assessments of health provider skills and performance in the diagnosis and&#13;
treatment of malaria cases. Actual provider performance will be assessed against the predefined&#13;
case management standards and protocols for the various drug-resistant forms of malaria.&#13;
Malaria outcome and impact will be monitored by observing trends in case fatality and death&#13;
rates, incidence, prevalence and the distribution of household bednet coverage in highly endemic&#13;
areas.&#13;
14.   The major program strategy to reduce malaria transmission (prevention) is to expand the&#13;
use of impregnated mosquito bednets. The project will monitor the coverage and use of bednets&#13;
by two different target populations. The objective is to achieve 80 percent impregnated bednet&#13;
use by the population in the 347 highly endemic communes identified for bednet targeting and&#13;
distribution. A second objective is to reach as many as possible of the migrant population at risk&#13;
through the social marketing of bednets. The project will monitor the program performance in&#13;
raising sales of marketed bednets to targeted high risk groups and areas of the country, based on&#13;
surveys conducted in the first and final years of the project.&#13;
&#13;

15. Tuberculosia. The two key tuberculosis program impact indicators are the_Annual_Risk&#13;
of Infection (ARI) and TB prevalence. The risk of infection is an index of the magnitude of the&#13;
tuberculosis problem in a society. The risk of infection at any point in time indicates the current&#13;
magnitude of the rate of recent infections and can be used to estimate the prevalence of infectious&#13;
cases in the population. In addition, it gives an indication of the tuberculosis problem in the&#13;
future. A decline in the ARI is an early indicator of a reduction in the transmission of&#13;
tuberculosis. Conversely, an increase could signal new risk factors, such as HIV infection or the&#13;
breakdown in the national control program. Exact measures of prevalence by survey is a more&#13;
costly but more accurate measure than estimates derived from ARI. A baseline national TB&#13;
prevalence survey will be conducted in the first year of the project. These figures will be used as&#13;
initial targets to monitor overall progress of TB case management by the national program. The&#13;
total number of cases treated and cured will be monitored. as will trends in case fatality and TB&#13;
death rates.&#13;
16.   HIV/AIDS/STD. The outcome/impact indicator for this component is behavior change&#13;
leading to a reduction in HIV and STD incidence. Given the difficulty in measuring incidence,&#13;
the practice is to measure prevalence through surveys of high risk populations. For HIV, this&#13;
will be undertaken annually and for STDs it will be undertaken every two years. To monitor&#13;
changes in behavior, surveys will be undertaken to determine changes in behavior related to risk&#13;
reduction during sexual encounters. Supplementing understanding of the course of the HIV&#13;
epidemic, information about the prevalence of HIV among blood donors will be gathered on a&#13;
continuous basis. It has to be recognized that the latter measure is not a reliable measure of&#13;
incidence of HIV in the population, as changes in policy about the acceptability of donors may&#13;
significantly alter apparent levels of HIV in the population.&#13;

Pre   mpm            Schedule&#13;
1.    The project is complex with a number of organizations involved and&#13;
organizational units within the MOH. All the implementation managers will have to&#13;
manage many of their respective responsibilities cooperatively as there are many&#13;
interdependent tasks.&#13;
2.    The Project Implementation Plan, Volume 1, contains a Summary Project&#13;
Workplan. This contains only the major tasks which must be performed during the first&#13;
year of this Project. Note that for all 11 sub-components, the tasks total to 1086 separate&#13;
steps, an indication of the importance of project management software to assist in project&#13;
management. The Project Coordination Unit will update the summary workplan based on&#13;
inputs from the component managers in the MOH and provincial Health Directorates.&#13;
3.    The major headings of the workplan in the Project Implementation Plan are&#13;
"Summary" tasks. In fact most all entries in this presentation are a summary of more&#13;
detailed tasks, and these can be found also in the Project Implementation Plan, Volume 1,&#13;
as part of each component's chapter. These were prepared by the Ministry of Health with&#13;
training from the World Bank task team. The World Bank will refer to the baseline&#13;
workplans for the purposes of project supervision.&#13;
4. ,  The workplans prepared for the PIP is part of a process designed to be part of the&#13;
Health Management Agreement annual formulation (see Annex 8), and the tasks agreed&#13;
and negotiated will fit into revised workplans by component.&#13;

IDA SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
1.   IDA Supervision lrpul. The staff input indicated in the table below is in addition to&#13;
regular supervision needs for the review of progress reports, procurement actions, supervision&#13;
report preparation and correspondence (estimated for this project to require six staff weeks&#13;
per year throughout implementation).&#13;
2.    Borrower's Contribution to Supervision&#13;
(a)   Annual work plans and budgets for the project, including the Health&#13;
Management Agreements, would be prepared by each central MOH&#13;
department and institute responsible for implementing specific project&#13;
activities, and each participating province. The plans and budgets of the&#13;
central departments/institutes would be reviewed by the appropriate technical&#13;
and financial staff of the MOH and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The&#13;
supervision plans of the provinces would be reviewed by the Project Director&#13;
and PCU, and would be agreed upon between the PCU and the provinces. The&#13;
MOH, PCU and the participating provinces would also be responsible for&#13;
negotiating the Health Management Agreements.&#13;
(b)   Semi-annual reports would be prepared by the PCU in a format to be agreed&#13;
upon with IDA during the project launch mission. The reports would:&#13;
(i) include a concise, narrative section describing major project achievements&#13;
and problems encountered; and (ii) utilize a simple, tabular account to show&#13;
details of actual accomplishments compared to agreed upon plans. The initial&#13;
progress report would be due on June 30, 1997, with successive reports due on&#13;
December 31 and June 30 of each year until project completion. The reports&#13;
would constitute the basis for the semi-annual project performance reviews to&#13;
be conducted by the Government and IDA.&#13;
(c)   Monitoring and reporting of implementation progress in accordance with the&#13;
annual plans would be the responsibility of the PC, with inputs from the&#13;
relevant MOH departments/institutes and the provincial project units. The&#13;
PCU would also be responsible for organizing annual workshops to review&#13;
implementation progress with provinces, which would be timed to support the&#13;
annual updating of the Health Management Agreements.&#13;
(d)   The PCU would be responsible for coordinating arrangements for supervision&#13;
missions, and for providing information required by missions. Mission&#13;
briefings upon arrival and wrap-up meetings would be presided over by the&#13;
Project Director or a designated representative.&#13;
&#13;

(e)   The PCU would prepare and submit to IDA within six months of the Closing&#13;
Date, a final evaluation report on the project and a plan for the future&#13;
operation of the completed project.&#13;
