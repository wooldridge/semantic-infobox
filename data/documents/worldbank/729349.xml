            Reform of the water, electricity, and
            telecommunications sectors is gathering momentum in nearly
            all developing countries. Reform should include an
            assessment of whether subsidies are necessary and if so, how
            to design subsidies that reach their intended beneficiaries
            accurately and do not distort the market. A major challenge
            for reforming governments is to build the capability to do
            this fast enough for subsidy redesign to be incorporated in
            sector reform. Clearly, it would save time to use existing
            sources of information. Potentially, one of the most useful
            sources is the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)
