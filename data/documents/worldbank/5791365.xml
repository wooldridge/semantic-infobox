  A. BACKGROUND:REFORMSAMIDA SOCIAL CRISIS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         CONFLICT, RECENT PROGRESS,AND THE CHALLENGESOFTRANSITION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       The Democratic Republic ofthe Congo (DRC) is gradually emerging from a&#13;
decade ofpolitical instability and conflict. War and civil disturbance, compoundedby&#13;
the sequels of a longperiod o fmismanagement and corruption, have taken a heavytoll on&#13;
DRC and its 53 million people. The conflict, inwhich seven foreign countries have been&#13;
involved at some point, has been the world's most murderous indecades, with an&#13;
estimated 3 million lives lost between 1997 and 2001.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Against this background, significant progress towards peace andreconciliation&#13;
has beenmade since 2001, withinthe context o fthe Lusaka Agreement signed in 1999 by&#13;
all key parties to the conflict and the consecutive agreements (see Box 1). The mediation&#13;
o f the UnitedNations, andthe support o f key bilateral partners, such as South Africa,&#13;
were critical inthis process. Despite ups and downs inthe stabilization process (which&#13;
are a characteristic o f post-conflict stabilization processes), and some delays on specific&#13;
issues, the situation has been steadily improving - although the challenges ahead remain&#13;
daunting.&#13;
&#13;
                          Box 1:Key politicaland military agreements&#13;
&#13;
  CeasefireAgreement, signed inLusakaonJuly 7, 1999. This Agreement underlinesthe need&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
3.       O n the military side, major fighting ended in2001. A UNpeace-keeping force,&#13;
theMission d'Observationdes Nations Uniesau Congo (MONUC) was deployed&#13;
throughout the country in2002. Foreigntroops present inDRC (in support o f rebel&#13;
groups) were withdrawn in2002, following agreements betweenDRC and Rwanda(in&#13;
July 2002) andbetween DRC and Uganda (in September 2002). With the support o f&#13;
MONUC, Belgium, and South Africa, steps were taken inlate 2003 to merge regular&#13;
armed forces and former rebel groups into national, integrated, and restructured armed&#13;
forces - including the unification o f the General Staffs, the appointment and installation&#13;
o f provincial military commanders inall provinces, and training activities. Similar&#13;
efforts have beenmade to reform and integrate police forces since 2004. Inparallel, a&#13;
National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) Programwas prepared&#13;
inmid-2004to deal withformer combatants -and its implementationis underway.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Inparallel, political negotiations culminated inanagreement on apower-sharing&#13;
arrangement for a transition period leading to elections within24 to 36 months. Within&#13;
this context, anall-inclusive Government ofnationalunitywithrepresentation ofall key&#13;
armed groups, unarmedopposition, and civil society was appointed on June 30,2003.&#13;
Steps have also been taken to organize elections (a referendum on the post-transitional&#13;
constitution, legislative elections andpresidential elections), which raises not only&#13;
political issues, but also formidable logistics challenges. Since its inception, and while&#13;
muchremains to be done to healthe scars left by years o f conflict, the Government has&#13;
demonstrated a stronger sense o f cohesion than could have been expected - and a&#13;
remarkable degree o f cohesion as regardsto the design and implementation o f economic&#13;
reforms.&#13;
&#13;
5,       Despite these achievements, however, the situation remains fragile. While&#13;
progress inDRC compares well with stabilization efforts inother post-conflict countries,&#13;
the challenges remain daunting. The size o fthe country andthe lack o f infrastructure&#13;
combine to make access to certain areas extremely difficult -which translates into&#13;
extreme poverty andpersistent insecurity inthese areas. Inaddition, the poor command&#13;
and control structure o f the armed forces andthe irregular payment o ftheir salaries&#13;
contribute to indiscipline withinthe ranks, which depend on the local population for their&#13;
sustenance. And while provincial governors andvice-governors were appointed inthe 11&#13;
provinces and took up their duties inMay 2004, State administration remains weak.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The fragility o f the situation has been highlightedboth by the endemic violence&#13;
which persists insome areas (notably inthe Northeastern district o f Ituriand in some&#13;
rural parts o f the Easternprovinces o f the Kivus), and by the series o f crises which&#13;
unfolded throughout 2004 (including localized explosions o f violence inthe Eastern part&#13;
o f the country and urbanriots). O nthe positive side, however, the Congolese&#13;
Government has been able to successfully manage these crises and to gradually appease&#13;
tensions, with a relatively minimal involvement by the international community (limited&#13;
to diplomatic mediation). Still, the appalling living conditions which many Congolese&#13;
endure create an environment, especially inurban centers, inwhich minor sparks can&#13;
easily and rapidly transform into full-blown explosions.&#13;

     ECONOMIC    STABILIZATION AND REFORM, AND THE CHALLENGES OF RECOVERY&#13;
&#13;
The impactof the conflict&#13;
&#13;
7.       The years o f conflict, compoundingthe legacy o f decades o f mismanagement and&#13;
poor governance, have taken a heavy toll on DRC. Despite its immense natural riches,&#13;
the country is among the poorest inthe world. Infrastructurehas suffered considerable&#13;
damage, inparticular due to the interruption o f maintenance (most o fthe road network i s&#13;
no longer passable; entire provinces do not have accessto energy or clean water) -and&#13;
entire districts have beenforced into autarky by the collapse o fthe transport system. Key&#13;
institutions are inshambles. Many people have lost their assets-whether buildings,&#13;
livestock, or tools. Investmenthas come to a halt and i s only slowly recovering. Public&#13;
debt has dramatically increased, while public finance management has deteriorated. The&#13;
vast majority o fthe population survive on informal economic activities, mainly carried&#13;
out by women.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Overall, per capita income, at about US$107 (29&#13;
cents per day) i s only a fraction o f what it was at the time o f           GDpp@b&#13;
independence, more than forty years ago (see Graph 1).&#13;
Prior to 1990, the Congolese economy was centered around                380&#13;
a broadrange o f competitive, foreign-dominated export&#13;
activities, developed around the country's extraordinary&#13;
natural resources (mining, agriculture, forestry, energy).&#13;
This hadresulted ina relatively highlevel o furbanization-&#13;
and it co-existed with traditional agriculture andinformal              1960   1997    m&#13;
activities which provided incomes to a large part o fthe&#13;
population. With the conflict, the formal private sector almost collapsed, with many&#13;
enterprises losing assets, staff, and commercial networks. Traditional export activities&#13;
almost came to a halt (to only 5 percent o f GDP) and services declined (from about 45&#13;
percent o f GDP inthe 1980s to 28 percent in2001), while the share o f agriculture&#13;
substantially increased (from 30 percent o f GDP inthe 1980s to 54 percent in2001).&#13;
Only 5 percent o f the active population has ajob inthe formal sector. Today's economy&#13;
i s based on subsistence, or even survival activities: informal activities (small-scale trade,&#13;
services, and daily labor) inurban areas, subsistence agriculture inrural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Government'seconomicprogram&#13;
&#13;
9.       Since April 2001,the Government has implementeda solid and ambitious&#13;
program o f economic reforms, supported by the Bretton Woods Institutions. This&#13;
program aims bothto spur economic growth andto tackle some o f the deep-rooted&#13;
structural issues which have hampered DRC's economic development inthe past. Ithas&#13;
been supported by the IMF through a Staff Monitored Program (SMP), between June&#13;
2001 andApril 2002, and access to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)&#13;
for the period July 2002 to July 2005 -and by the Bankthrough an Emergency Early&#13;
Recovery Project (financed through an IDA grant andapproved inJuly 2001), an&#13;
Economic Recovery Credit (approved inJune 2002), a Post-Reunification Economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 8 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Recovery Credit (approved inFebruary 2004) as well as investment projects and&#13;
substantial analytical work and policy advice. Overall, implementation has been&#13;
consistently satisfactory throughout the period.&#13;
&#13;
10.     The results of this program are significant, even though they need to be further&#13;
consolidated. Hyper-inflation was broken by the end o f 2001, and inflation has&#13;
decelerated even more quickly than envisaged (at about 4.4 percent for 2003, about half&#13;
the program target). Exchangerate stability hasbeenbroadly maintained since the&#13;
Government floated the Congolese franc inApril 2001. Fiscal revenues are expected to&#13;
reach 9.2 percent o f GDP in2004 (above the 9 percent target o f the program) -a&#13;
significant increase from the 5.9 percent o f 2001 - and are expected to further increase in&#13;
the years to come, to reachabout 12percent ofGDP (close to US$1billion) in2008. In&#13;
the first quarter of 2005, however, the exchange rate deteriorated and inflation picked up.&#13;
The Government has defined togetherwith the IMFa number o f corrective measures, and&#13;
i s implementingthem in a satisfactory manner.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Inparallel, the Government hasmade significant efforts to dealwithan&#13;
overwhelmingdebt burden. DRC reachedthe HIPC Decision Point inJune 2003 -with a&#13;
total assistance estimated at US$6.3 billioninNet Present Value (NPV) terms, for a total&#13;
stock o f external debt outstanding estimated at US$7.9 billion inNPV terms at end-2002&#13;
(US$10.7 billion innominal terms). The Completion Point is expected to be reached in&#13;
late 2006, with floating triggers related to: (i)completion o f a full Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy Paper (PRSP) and its implementation for one year; (ii)     continued performance in&#13;
terms o f macro-economic stability; (iii) effective use o f budgetary savings for poverty-&#13;
related programs; (iv) improvements inpublic expenditure management; (v) enhanced&#13;
service delivery and governance inpriority sectors (health, education, rural development,&#13;
and infrastructure); (vi) adoption of satisfactory sectoral strategies and related&#13;
implementationplans for health, education, and rural development; and (vii)&#13;
improvements inpublic debt management. Steps have recently been taken, with support&#13;
from the Bank through the Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit, to settle a&#13;
domestic debt estimated at US$500 to US$600 million (including the audit o f most&#13;
claims, and the selection o f a negotiator).&#13;
&#13;
12.     On the structural side, a solid program o freforms has been implemented, with&#13;
significant achievements ina broad range o f areas (see Box 2). Reforms have been&#13;
aimed at correcting major deficiencies -to spur growth through private sector activity,&#13;
and to start tackling key transparency and efficiency issues inthe management o f natural&#13;
andpublic resources. This has elicited a strong private sector response: about US$2.4&#13;
billion innew investments under consideration have been registeredby the Government&#13;
since early 2003 (private capital flows to sub-Saharan Africa in2002 totaled about&#13;
US$12 billion) ina broad range o f sectors (e.g., services, agro-business, constructions,&#13;
natural resource exploitation). Flagship operations include a US$94 million cellular&#13;
phone project by a Britishcompany, Vodaphone, a phased US$600 millioninvestment&#13;
project by Congo Korea Telecom to install a telecom backbone inthe country, or the&#13;
launch o f a three-year program to increase offshore oil production by a Chevron-Texaco-&#13;
led consortium.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
13.    As a result of the Government's reform efforts, economic growth returnedin2002&#13;
after over ten years of contraction, and i s now accelerating (see Graph 2). Growth has&#13;
been mainly pulledby the resumption o f economic activity which followed the re-&#13;
establishment o f security and the reunification o fthe country (a pattern typical o f post-&#13;
conflict countries), an increase inagricultural production, the booming of selected&#13;
services, and the comeback o f the construction industry-reflecting the beginning o f the&#13;
transformation of the economy away from the traditional miningand export sectors.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.    Despite these efforts, however, the challenges remain formidable and the situation&#13;
very fragile:&#13;
&#13;
    0  On the growth side, the economic collapse has been such that, assuming an&#13;
       average economic growth o f 5.3 percent a year, it would take until2060 to return&#13;
       to the level o f GDP per capita in 1960 - andwith an average economic growth of&#13;
       4 percent only (and a 2.7 percent population growth), it would take about 200&#13;
       years. It will take decades, ifnot centuries, for growth to bring living conditions&#13;
       inDRCto the levelofits neighbors(which are amongthe world's poorest&#13;
       countries).&#13;
&#13;
   0   On thepoverty reduction side, DRC's fiscal resources, remain insufficient to meet&#13;
       even the most basic needs. As an illustration, the bulk o f civil service salaries&#13;
       range from US$3 to US$50 a month, with qualified staff (e.g., doctors,&#13;
       magistrates, etc.) commonly paid about US$30 a month (i.e. US$1 a day, a level&#13;
       o f income which is considered the definition o f extreme poverty) -while the cost&#13;
       o f living, inparticular inurban areas, i s muchhigher. The Government's capacity&#13;
       to engage inpro-poor spending, to improve living conditions, and to stabilize the&#13;
       social situation remains severely constrained by the lack o f resources.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                      THESOCIAL CRISISAND THE RISKSITCARRIES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15.     Progress towards political transition and economic recovery are taking place&#13;
within a context of a severe social crisis. While political progress, economic reforms,&#13;
and the return o f growth have producedvisible results inKinshasa and other places (for&#13;
example inKisangani, where the re-opening o fthe River Congo inthe summer o f 2003&#13;
has resulted inhalving key commodity prices), poverty remains widespread and acute&#13;
throughout the country - and hunger i s present throughout the country, with an estimated&#13;
16 million people having critical food needs, and the vast majority o fthe population&#13;
consuming less than two thirds o f the daily calories neededto maintain good health.&#13;
&#13;
16.     While detailed data are still missing, all key social indicators shave sufferedmajor&#13;
setbacks over the last period, and the chances for DRC to achieve the Millennium&#13;
Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 are seriously compromised.&#13;
&#13;
17.     The social crisis carries very significant risksfor the success ofboththe political&#13;
transition and the economic reform processes. Muchhas been achieved over the last&#13;
period to move towards peace and reconciliation. But these achievements, while&#13;
important steps forward, are only the beginningo f a process. The challenge now i s to&#13;
consolidate past efforts and sustain the pace - so as to ensure the investment already&#13;
made can yield the expected results. Inthis context, there i s a broad consensus that&#13;
managing the social crisis and laying the ground for economic growth andpoverty&#13;
alleviation are critical to the success o fthe overall effort -and require urgent action.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The risks are particularly highinurbanareas, where about a third o f the&#13;
population lives (see Box 4). With a relatively large number o f urbancenters, and an&#13;
urbanization accelerated by the conflict, cities inDRC are critical to both social stability&#13;
and economic growth. Still, infrastructure and services have considerably deteriorated&#13;
over the last decade. This has hadtwo consequences: urbanpeople are living in&#13;
increasedpoverty with deteriorated social indicators, and cities can no longer play their&#13;
economic role o f places o f exchange and pools o f financial and human resources (which&#13;
inturnhasa significant impact onthe economic and social situationinrural areas). In&#13;
urbancenters, economic collapse, deterioratingliving conditions and inflows of displaced&#13;
persons hence combine to create a highlyvolatile environment, inwhich minor sparks&#13;
can trigger major social explosions - as illustratedby the series o f riots and violence in&#13;
June 2004.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           THEDONORS'     RESPONSE: A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT&#13;
&#13;
The establishmentof a partnership&#13;
&#13;
20.      The Bank's responseto the challenges of transition and recovery inDRC is&#13;
designedandimplementedas part of a broader donor response. The magnitude and&#13;
complexity of the needs are such that the involvement of a significant number of donors&#13;
i s required - andthat a strong coordination i s needed, not only among donors, but also&#13;
betweenthe political, economic, and social processes. The Bank has played a key role in&#13;
the mobilizationandcoordinationprocess, inparticular by organizing a series ofdonor&#13;
meetings-donor information meetings to exchangewith the Government on the&#13;
challengesandpriorities (inJuly 2001, December 2001,May 2002), Consultative Group&#13;
meetings to mobilize resources(inDecember 2002, December 2003, and November&#13;
2004), and a stocktaking meeting (inJune 2004). A follow-up and stocktaking meeting is&#13;
plannedfor mid-2005 and a newconsultative group meeting for end 2005.&#13;
&#13;
21,      As the Government was satisfactorily implementing its ambitious program of&#13;
economic reforms, donors gradually stepped up their support, and inparticular provided&#13;
significant external assistance. Such assistance consists not only inpledges, but also and&#13;
most importantly inactual disbursements-which illustrates the fact that DRC's&#13;
absorptivecapacity is muchlarger thanwas initially feared. Since 2001,disbursements&#13;
have rapidly increased-from US$210million to about US$l,100million between2000&#13;
and 2004 (see Graph 3) -with over 25 donors currently engaged, including both&#13;
bilaterals and multilaterals.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
22.     Inparallel, the relationship between DRC anddonors went through a gradual&#13;
transformation, to take the shape o f a genuinepartnership. This partnershipi s inspiredby&#13;
the principles of the New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD) -with both&#13;
sides o f the partnership sharing the same overall objectives and a common approach and&#13;
strategy - and with the Government focusing onthe design and implementation o f sound&#13;
economic reforms, and external partners providing the type o f support needed, including&#13;
financial assistance, needed for the success o fthese efforts. The nature o fthe&#13;
partnership, the importance of such an approach, and the quality of the relationship were&#13;
explicitly recognized by boththe Government and donors duringthe November 2004&#13;
Consultative Group meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The MinimumPartnershipProgramfor RecoveryandTransition&#13;
&#13;
23.     To formalize the partnership, and following the recommendations made by the&#13;
participants inthe December 2003 meetingo f the Consultative Group, the Government&#13;
prepared a "Minimum Partnership Program for Recovery and Transition" (French&#13;
acronym: PMPTR). The preparationprocess included intense consultations not only with&#13;
technical institutions and entities -but also through a dialogue at the provincial level with&#13;
regional authorities, private sector, andcivil society. This work was carried out with the&#13;
support o f several multilateral organizations, including the World Bank, the United&#13;
Nations Development Program (UNDP), and MONUC. It was presented ina draft form&#13;
to the donors inJune 2004 -and formally endorsed during the November 2004&#13;
Consultative Group meeting.&#13;
&#13;
24.     The PMPTR i s a comprehensive transition and recovery strategy that clearly&#13;
spells out the crucial principles o fpartnership, mutual commitment and responsibilities,&#13;
Government accountability and the importance o f coordinating efforts at all levels -&#13;
between the Government and donors, withinthe Government at the inter-ministerial&#13;
level, betweenthe Government and stakeholders, and between donors. Itproposes an&#13;
overall strategic framework for transition and recovery, and presents an articulation o fthe&#13;
needs - for bothreforms and investments - ineach o f 16 areas, ranging from macro-&#13;
economic stability to infrastructure, from the social sectors to the organization o f&#13;
elections, from security sector reform to environment or rural development. The total&#13;
cost o fthe PMPTR amounts to US$6.87 billion over a three- to four-year period (see&#13;
Table 1) -which corresponds to about US$21 per capita andper year, significantly less&#13;
than similar programs inother post-conflict countries.&#13;
&#13;
25.     The PMPTR is part o fthe overall PRSP process. It is a response to calls for an&#13;
early framework as the PRSPis being finalized -so as to ensure an adequate focus for&#13;
the efforts ofthe Government andthe support by donors duringthe critical coming years.&#13;
Itis, however, part o fthe same single strategic effort aimed at defining avision for&#13;
DRC's poverty reduction process. It i s based on the work carried out under the interim&#13;
PRSP and duringthe early stages o fthe PRSP consultations. It is expected to inform the&#13;
fullPRSP (which is expected to be completedinthe secondhalfo f2005), bothat the&#13;
strategic and sectoral level.&#13;

&#13;
26.     The PMPTR constitutes the basis for the dialogue between donors and the&#13;
Government-for the Government to demonstrate its commitment to reform by moving&#13;
ahead on the outlined priority agenda, as well as for donors to pledge and disburse&#13;
resources against clearly identifiedpriority investments. Donors have repeatedly&#13;
congratulated the Government for the quality o fthe document, both as an overall&#13;
strategic framework and at the level o f each sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The overall priorities ahead&#13;
&#13;
27.     Within the overall strategic framework ofthe PMPTR, key priorities for the&#13;
period ahead were identified and discussed at the November 2004 Consultative Group&#13;
meeting. Boththe Government and donors emphasized the acuity o f the ongoing social&#13;
crisis and the needto rapidly deliver peace dividends, especially inurban centers, to keep&#13;
the transition andrecovery process on track -with a strong consensus emergingaround&#13;
the needfor urgentaction. Participantsinthe meeting also committedto a continued,&#13;
strong partnership and agreed on the priorities for both sides.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Onthe Government side, these priorities are three-fold. First, move the political&#13;
process forward -by re-establishingthe authority o f the State and security throughout the&#13;
country, by implementingan in-depth reform o f the security sector, and by holding free&#13;
and fair elections with a timingconsistent with the agreements reached withinthe inter-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           - 16-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Congolese dialogue framework. Second, pursueeconomic reforms -macro-economic&#13;
reforms, business climate reforms, and governance reforms (includingtransparency and&#13;
the payment o f civil service salaries). And third, work towards social inclusion (in&#13;
particular by removing legal obstacles to a full participationo f women and marginalized&#13;
groups inthe transition andrecovery process). These overall priorities translate into a&#13;
series o f key reforms at the sectoral level, as spelled out inthe PMPTR.&#13;
&#13;
29.      On the donors side, more and better assistance i s needed. With regardto the&#13;
volume o f aid, donors pledged a total o f about US$5.7 billion for the next four years (the&#13;
duration of the PMPTR) - and announced intended disbursementswhich amount to about&#13;
US$1.2 billion in2005 (including a broader and increased support to the budget, as well&#13;
as substantial assistance for the organization o f elections). With regard to the quality o f&#13;
aid, donors agreed not only on the needto ensure a close coordination o f their activities,&#13;
but also on the urgency to move the harmonizationagenda forward. With strong support&#13;
bythe Government, a number o f donors called for the development o fjoint&#13;
implementationmechanisms, including the pooling o f resources andthe use ofjoint&#13;
monitoring and evaluation systems.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank's strategy inDRC&#13;
&#13;
30.      The Bank re-engaged inDRC through a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS),&#13;
which was discussed inJuly 2001. A second TSS was discussed inFebruary 2004, which&#13;
proposes an assistance program for 2004 -2006 (which roughly coincides with the&#13;
period o f political transition). At the end o fthe TSS period, staff will review the situation&#13;
(both social stability and implementation o f economic reforms) as well as the status o f&#13;
preparation o f a full PRSP, with a view to moving to a formal Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) as soon as conditions allow.&#13;
&#13;
31.      Overall, Bank support duringthe 2001 TSS period has been credited to have made&#13;
a critical contribution to the political and economic stabilization o f the country -by the&#13;
highest Governmental authorities, the UNSpecial Representative o f the Secretary&#13;
General, donors, and civil society. A relationship o f trust has beendeveloped with the&#13;
Government and key stakeholders (including private sector and civil society), which has&#13;
beeninstrumentalindefining and implementing the program o f economic reforms&#13;
currently underway and insupporting the overall recovery effort. All performance&#13;
indicators were reached or exceeded.&#13;
&#13;
32.      The objective o fthe current TSS is to support the recovery and transition process,&#13;
that is to help consolidate the peace andreconciliation process andto restore the&#13;
foundations on which effective poverty alleviation efforts can be successfully undertaken.&#13;
Itincludes four strategic elements: (i)security and social stability, which includes&#13;
consolidating social stability involatile areas, especially inurban centers, and re-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 17-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
establishing the authority o f the State throughout the country; (ii) and shared growth,&#13;
                                                                     high&#13;
which requires a particular effort to rehabilitate transport infrastructure (since the&#13;
collapse o f the transport system i s the single most stringent constraint to economic&#13;
recovery inlarge parts of the country) and urbaninfrastructure (for urban centers to&#13;
effectively regain their central role as marketplaces andpools o f capacities); (iii)&#13;
governance and institutional strengthening, inparticular at the provincial level; and (iv)&#13;
social development, inparticular to improve living conditions inurban areas, where a&#13;
thirdo fDRC's population lives and where "quick-wins" canbe most easily achieved.&#13;
&#13;
33.     Inoperationalterms, the TSS proposes a five-fold agenda: (i) the existing&#13;
                                                                          manage&#13;
portfolio, to maintain the current strong implementationperformance; (ii)      provide&#13;
advisory services and develop a knowledgebase, to assist inthe design and&#13;
implementation o f further economic reforms; (iii) new lendingoperations, as part&#13;
                                                     launch&#13;
o f a broad and significant donor effort; (iv) engage the entire Bank Group, including IFC&#13;
and MIGA to support privatesector recovery; and (v) helpthe Government mobilize and&#13;
coordinate donors, which i s critical inview o fthe magnitude o fthe needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OngoingBankactivities&#13;
&#13;
34.     The Bank re-engaged inDRC inmid-2001. Prior to, and since then, the Bank has&#13;
provided substantial analytical support and assistance to enhance administrative capacity&#13;
as well as to help design and implementeconomic reforms. Inparallel, the Bank has&#13;
provided significant financial support -inline with findings from bothresearch and&#13;
experience that highlevels o f financial assistance are needed inpost-conflict situation&#13;
and can yield disproportionatereturns. Arrears to the Bank (about US$338 million) were&#13;
cleared inJuly 2002, and nineprojects were approved (see Box 5). Additional financial&#13;
support was provided through a US$178 millionmulti-country Southern Africa Power&#13;
Pool Project (approved inNovember 2003), as well as several Bank-managed Trust&#13;
Fundsand small grants.&#13;
&#13;
35.     Implementation o f Bank-financed projects is overall satisfactory. Procurement&#13;
and financial management systems have been put inplace to ensure an effective and&#13;
transparent use o f available financial resources. Early results (notably from the&#13;
Emergency Early Recovery Project and the Economic Recovery Credit) have been&#13;
impressive and have translated into notable improvements inliving conditions in&#13;
Kinshasa (inparticular through the rehabilitation o f the city's major supply road). The&#13;
Mid-Term Review (inApril 2005) of the Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and&#13;
ReconstructionProject, the first and largest Bank-financed investment project, has also&#13;
noted a strong implementation performance. Overall, DRC's absorption capacity has&#13;
significantly increased over the last period and does not constitute a critical constraint for&#13;
further external support. There is a consensuswithinthe donor community that, withthe&#13;
use o f adequate implementation mechanisms, the level o f external financing that could be&#13;
effectively absorbed inDRC i s substantially larger than what i s available to date.&#13;

&#13;
36.      For the full benefits o fthe transition and recovery efforts supported by the Bank&#13;
to materialize, however, improvements o f living conditions are key. There is a&#13;
widespread consensus that failure inrapidly generating such peace dividends, especially&#13;
inurbanareas, would result incontinued social instability, which could cause major civil&#13;
unrest and possibly renewed war. Success inthe economic and social arenas will be&#13;
critical to prevent such a scenario from happening.&#13;

                                     PROJECTOBJECTIVE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37.     Inthe context ofthe Government's responseto the recovery andtransition&#13;
challenges, o f the existing consensus among donors, and o f the overall Bank strategy in&#13;
DRC, the Project's objective i s to assist the Government in improving living conditions&#13;
by strengthening the socio-economic situation in key urban centers and in two isolated&#13;
areas - i.e.: (i)improving delivery o f basic services inprovincial capitals and key&#13;
mediumurbancenters; and (ii)       restoring key transport links to reconnect two isolated&#13;
regions. Such support i s critical to help mitigate the ongoing social crisis inpotentially&#13;
explosive areas and to strengthen the environment inwhich the processes o f transition&#13;
and recovery unfold- and constitutes a first step towards poverty alleviation inthese&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
38.     The impact o fthese actions will be measuredthrough: (i) increased quality&#13;
                                                                      the&#13;
and coverage o f services available intarget urbanareas (against a set o fbaselines specific&#13;
to each urban center); and (ii)  a decrease o ftransport costs to re-connected areas (and&#13;
hence a decrease of prices for basic commodities inthese areas). Detailed performance&#13;
indicators for the Project are describedinAppendix F.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       OVERALL      DESIGN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
39.     The Project i s part o f a broad set o f actions by IDA and other donors to support&#13;
the transition andrecovery agenda inDRC. Itbuildson experience with three multi-&#13;
sectoral Bank-funded projects -the EERP, the EMRRP, and the EESRSP -which are&#13;
beingsuccessfully implemented.&#13;
&#13;
40.     More specifically, the Project aims to scale-up activities financed under the&#13;
EESRSP (see Box 6) - by replicating these activities inother parts of the country. While&#13;
the EESRSP coveredthe four Easternprovinces, the Project will cover the six remaining&#13;
provinces, inthe West andthe South of the country (achieving full coverage of the entire&#13;
country, but the Kinshasa area). Investments selected for financing will be of a similar&#13;
nature than those under the EESRSP. Implementationmechanismwill reproduce&#13;
approaches which have proven successful under the EESRSP (andreflect lessons learned&#13;
to date inimplementingsuch activities). This approach i s expected to simplify and&#13;
accelerate implementation - and therefore to facilitate the delivery o f quick results.&#13;
&#13;
41.     The Project includes four components as described below. Since the main&#13;
challenge i s to ensure effective implementationthroughout the country (inparticular in&#13;
relatively isolated urbancenters), the components have been defined as a set o f activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 20 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
which canbe implementedthrough acommon implementation mechanism(rather than&#13;
through a sectoral breakdown).&#13;
&#13;
   a   Component A: Support to medium urban centers (US$lOmillion). This&#13;
       component will be a geographicalexpansionof similar activities successfully&#13;
       implemented underthe EERP andthe EESRSP(component 4). Itwill provide&#13;
       resourcesto finance emergency activities (for infrastructure rehabilitation, social&#13;
       services delivery, and economic revitalization activities) ineighteenmedium-size&#13;
       cities located inthe Western and Southemprovinces.&#13;
&#13;
   a   Component B: Support toprovincial capitals (US$27 million). This component&#13;
       will be a geographical expansionof similar activities successfully implemented&#13;
       under the EESRSP (component 4). It will finance quick-impact investmentsin&#13;
       the capitals ofthe Western and Southemprovinces (including infrastructure&#13;
       rehabilitation, social services delivery, and economic revitalization activities with&#13;
       aparticular focus on labor-intensive activities), as well as targeted support to&#13;
       specific technical entities.&#13;
&#13;
   a   Component C: Connectivity to isolated areas (US$32 million). This component&#13;
       will bea scale-up of similar activities successfully implementedunder the&#13;
       EESRSP (component 3). Itwill finance the rehabilitation oftwo major roads, to&#13;
       re-connect two isolated regions (Northem Equateur and EastemKatanga) to the&#13;
       national transport network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   Box 6: Statusof implementationof EESRSP (as of April 2005)&#13;
&#13;
   The US$214millionEESRSPaims to support the process of economic and social reunification,&#13;
   and focuses onthe reunifiedprovinces. Twelve months after effectiveness, the status of&#13;
   implementationfor each ofthe five components is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
   Component1:Support to the balance of payments (US$50million). The component has been&#13;
   fully disbursed andthe supportingdocumentation for audits has beencollectedandreviewed.&#13;
&#13;
   Component2: Institutional strengthening (US'S15million). The component is 95 percent&#13;
   committedand 23 percent disbursed. Mostactivitieswill be completedby end 2005.&#13;
&#13;
   Component3: Road rehabilitation (US$90million), The component is 75 percent committed&#13;
   (fullcommitment is expectedby June 2005) and 11percent disbursed. Technicalstudieshave&#13;
   beencompleted(ina very difficult environment), four ofthe five maincontracts have been&#13;
   awarded, andworks are underway(and are expectedto be completed by end-2006).&#13;
&#13;
   Component4: Urban rehabilitation (US$30million). The component is fully committedand&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
        Component D: Support toprovincial institutions (US$7million). This component&#13;
        will be a scale up o f similar activities successfully implemented with financing&#13;

million under IDA 13 and US$11 millionunder IDA 14. Activities proposed under the&#13;
Project are inline with priorities identified inthe TSS and are expected to include&#13;
investmentsineducation, health, and clean water. Other considerations justifying the&#13;
allocation o f grant resources under IDA 13 to finance this Project include: (i) the&#13;
proposed grant has been designed inaccordance with OP 2.30; (ii) performance i s&#13;
                                                                      early&#13;

&#13;
                         RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
44.     The rationale for the Project is two-fold:&#13;
&#13;
    e   First, it ispart of a broader effort aimed at consolidating the transition and&#13;
        recovery processes in DRC. Together with other activities (supported by the&#13;
        Bank and other donors), it i s expected to generate "peace dividends" inparts o f&#13;
        the country which have benefited from relatively little assistance to date -hence&#13;
        helping to stabilize the social situation and strengthening the environment in&#13;
        whichthe transition andrecovery processes unfold. Recent DEC research on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 22 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       assistance inpost-conflict situations as well as Bank experience inthis area&#13;
       suggest that such support i s critical and that relatively small investments can have&#13;
       a disproportionate impact.&#13;
&#13;
       Second, it constitutes a geographical expansion of Bank-financed activities&#13;
       reflecting an improvement inthe security situation inmost outer provinces, as&#13;
       well as the urgency ofthe needs. Itfocuses on restoring critical functions for&#13;
       spurringeconomic growth inthese provinces -i.e. the restoration o ftransport&#13;
       links and the re-development o f urbancenters as places o f exchange and pools o f&#13;
       human resources.&#13;
&#13;
45.    Inaddition, several o fthe Project's key features are particularly relevantto the&#13;
current situation inDRC:&#13;
&#13;
       First, thefocus on living conditions improvement. This is the highest priority&#13;
       identifiedby boththe Government andthe international community - as&#13;
       illustrated by its prominence inthe PMPTR as well as inthe discussions during&#13;
       the Consultative Group meeting. The proposed operation i s therefore fully&#13;
       consistent with, and a critical part of, the partnership developedbetween DRC and&#13;
       donors to help the country face the critical challenges o f transition and recovery.&#13;
&#13;
       Second, the geographical focus of the operation. The benefits to be accrued from&#13;
       the Project are both spread throughout the country and concentrated on a&#13;
       relatively limited number o f areas- allowing therefore for a significant and&#13;
       visible impact intarget areas. This i s a difference from earlier operations, which&#13;
       were either geographically focused on specific regions or widely spread across the&#13;
       country. It responds well to the current situation inDRC, where the challenge i s&#13;
       both to stabilize the situation incritical areas throughout the country and to re-&#13;
       create poles o f growth or centers o ftrade and exchange for the future.&#13;
&#13;
       Third, the choice to scale-up an existing operation. Inview o f the Project's&#13;
       emergency nature and objectives, its impact narrowly depends on the pace o f&#13;
       implementation. The use of existing implementation mechanisms which have&#13;
       beensuccessfully tested under a previous operation is a practical way to ensure&#13;
       quick wins and rapid, visible results. It also contributes to the simplification and&#13;
       harmonization agenda within the donor community -by strengtheninga financing&#13;
       and implementation channel which could become a key element o f an integrated,&#13;
       harmonized aid delivery mechanism.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46.    The overall architecture o fthe Project reflects lessons learned, through Bank&#13;
interventions inother post-conflict countries, as well as through earlier interventions in&#13;
DRC, and inparticular:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            - 23 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Generating `)peace dividends" throughout the transition period is critical to help&#13;
      stabilize fragile political and social situations indifficult post-conflict&#13;
      environments. Ina situation like DRC, there i s a consensus that creating&#13;
      economic opportunities would go a long way towards consolidating the&#13;
      environment inwhich the transition and recovery process unfolds.&#13;
&#13;
      Ensuring that benefits are adequately spread throughout the country and&#13;
      balanced across regions is an essential element o f both effective stabilization&#13;
      strategies and effective growth strategies. Ina situation like DRC, where regional&#13;
      imbalances have contributed to political instability over the last decade, particular&#13;
      attention needs to be paid to this issue.&#13;
&#13;
      Multi-sector approaches are needed for emergency assistance to have a&#13;
      substantial and rapid impact on growth prospects and social stability ina highly-&#13;
      disruptedenvironment. Eventhough multi-sector operations may be more&#13;
      difficult to manage, effective interventions need to address inparallel a broad&#13;
      variety o f issues.&#13;
&#13;
47.   The Project's designalso reflects lessons learned inimplementingthe EESRSP,&#13;
and inparticular:&#13;
&#13;
      Thefeasibility of overcoming the difficult capacity constraints, as demonstrated&#13;
      through the successful implementationo fthe EERP, the ERC, the EMRRP, the&#13;
      PSDCP, the EESRSP, and the PRERC. The proposedimplementation&#13;
      arrangements for the Project draw on this experience.&#13;
&#13;
      Theneed to involveprivate sector and civil society in the selection ofpriority&#13;
      activities. Priorities were selected through a broad consultation with all key&#13;
      stakeholders - and the proposedactivities reflect a large consensus among all&#13;
      stakeholders. This will help ensure that resources are spent wisely and that&#13;
      benefits are widely shared - and facilitate the mobilization o f the Congolese in&#13;
      support o f Bank-funded activities.&#13;
&#13;
      Therole Congolese technical institutions canplay. The situation o f technical&#13;
      institutions inDRC i s highly variable - and caution has to be used in generalizing&#13;
      isolatedexperiences. Still, selected technical institutions have proven able to play&#13;
      a key role intechnical matters (e.g., design, supervision), with minimal external&#13;
      assistance. Once adequately trained and equipped, the performance o f these&#13;
      institutions has exceeded expectations. This calls for an increased involvement o f&#13;
      such institutions -based on a careful review o ftheir capacity, andwith adequate&#13;
      safeguards on transparency issues.&#13;
&#13;
      The need topay particular attention to issues of transparency, inparticular in&#13;
      view of DRC's past track record infinancial management -although experience&#13;
      since 2001has shown a consistently highperformance on these matters under&#13;

COMPONENT SUPPORT TO MEDIUM URBANCENTERS(US$lO MILLION)&#13;
                A:&#13;
&#13;
Overall design&#13;
&#13;
48.     The component aims to support the recovery of basic services and accessibility in&#13;
priority medium-size urbanareas. It will finance emergency small-scale activities,&#13;
selected through a consultative mechanism, and including infrastructure rehabilitation,&#13;
social services delivery, and economic revitalization activities. Emphasiswill be placed&#13;
on actions which can have a rapid impact - so as to relieve some o f the economic and&#13;
social hardship caused by the conflict, and to rapidly restore the economic functions of&#13;
these urban centers with regard to surrounding rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
49.     The component builds on the successful implementation experience o f similar&#13;
activities financed under the EERP (for community-level recovery activities inand&#13;
around Kinshasa), the EMRRP (for the community projects sub-component), and the&#13;
EESRSP (for emergency urbanworks inurban centers inthe Easternpart o f the country).&#13;
Itwill provide resources to geographically expandthe coverageo fthese programsto&#13;
areas which were not covered.&#13;
&#13;
50.     The component will be implementedbythe Bureau Central de Coordination&#13;
(BCECO), which has acquired substantial experience in successfully carrying out similar&#13;
activities under earlier projects. BCECO will operate under a service contract with the&#13;
Government. On behalf o f the Government, BCECO will oversee the identification and&#13;
evaluation o f activities, enter into contractual agreements with private contractors for the&#13;
execution o f these activities, and ensure supervision and payment o f these contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Selection of activities&#13;
&#13;
5 1.    The Government has provided BCECO with a list o f 18 priority urbancenters to&#13;
be covered under the program (see list inAppendix C). This list was established through&#13;
intensivediscussions andconsultations at national and provincial levels-includingwith&#13;
the involvement o frelevant technical institutions as well as civil society representatives.&#13;
These cities were selected on the basis of three main criteria: (i)the urgency o f the needs;&#13;
(ii) prevailingsecurityconditions(whichareadequatefordevelopmentactivitiesto&#13;
    the&#13;
be implemented); and (iii) conditions (including for contractors).&#13;
                             access&#13;
&#13;
52.      Eachof the 18 urbancenters will be allocated an equal amount o f US$500,000.&#13;
Rehabilitation needs inthe target cities far exceed this amount, and only highpriority&#13;
activities will be financed under the Project -but while needs differ widely throughout&#13;
the country, the type o f activities to be implementedto have a visible impact on living&#13;
conditions, strengthen social stability, and lay the ground for further development i s&#13;
similar. The proposed allocation hence corresponds to the amount needed to have a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 26 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
significant, although not disproportionate impact at the level o f each urban center - it will&#13;
typically cover the rehabilitation o f one school, one health center, a local market, and&#13;
some minimal transport infrastructure (rural roads, a bridge, etc.). For a typical target&#13;
urban center, the allocation amounts to US$7 to US$16 per inhabitant. A lower amount&#13;
would have a very limitedimpact -while a higher amount would result inreducingthe&#13;
number o fbeneficiary cities andhence the scope o fthe Project.&#13;
&#13;
53.     Activities that can be financed include: social services delivery (e.g., education,&#13;
health, community centers), economic revitalization (e.g., water, markets,&#13;
slaughterhouses, transport, and energy), and environmental and sanitation services (e.g.,&#13;
rehabilitation o f sewage and drainage networks). Works, furniture, equipment, supplies,&#13;
and the delivery o f services (such as training o fteachers or nurses, and campaigns to&#13;
preventthe spread o f infectious diseases) will be financed as may be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
54.     Flexibility and local ownership inthe selection o f specific activities to be financed&#13;
underthe component is critical for success. The selection will therefore be carried out&#13;
through a local level consultation process and on the basis of eligibility criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   The consultationprocess will aim to ensure broadparticipation from local&#13;
        institutions, private sector, and civil society (including faith-based organizations)&#13;
        inthe selectionofpriorities. Itwill include bothinformation campaigns (through&#13;
        radio) and public meetings. Details o fthe process will be agreed upon by local&#13;
        authorities and BCECO, with a view to ensuring its fit with the social and cultural&#13;
        realities o f each target area. A report on the process will accompany the list o f&#13;
        priorities submitted to the Bank for non-objection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   The eligibility criteria are detailed inthe draft operational manual. They include&#13;
        standardcriteria successfully usedunderthe EERP, the EMRRP,and the EESRSP&#13;
        -andinparticular:&#13;
&#13;
            (i) Location of the activities: the component will be strictly implementedin&#13;
            designated priority urbanareas andtheir surrounding.&#13;
&#13;
            (ii) anddurationof theactivities. Activitiesareexpectedtoaverage&#13;
                Size&#13;
            betweenUS$50,000 and US$150,000 (and no more than US$250,000) by&#13;
            individual task. The scope o f eligible activities should be such that they can&#13;
            be completedwithin 12months after inception (keeping inmindseasonality&#13;
            constraints).&#13;
&#13;
            (iii) of theactivities. Nonewconstruction-onlyrehabilitation-will&#13;
                 Nature&#13;
            be financed. Selected activities should yield benefits widely distributed&#13;
            withinthe community, and contribute to improving living conditions within&#13;
            the community.&#13;
&#13;
            (iv) Commitment to operation and maintenance. There will be no mandatory&#13;
            thresholds for community participation -as this has proven difficult to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 27 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            implementinseverely impoverishedcommunities. Still, realistic and&#13;
            sustainable mechanisms for operation and maintenance (including financing&#13;
            and the naming o f individuals incharge) should be devised as part o f the&#13;
            selection process (andmay include in-kindcontributions by beneficiaries).&#13;
            Where the availability o f alternative resources cannot be confirmed, operation&#13;
            and maintenance for a three-year period will be fundedunder the component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implementationof activities&#13;
&#13;
55,     Implementation i s expected to be particularly difficult, since the component will&#13;
include activities ina large number o f urban centers - ina post-conflict context,&#13;
characterized by a highdegree o f political fragmentation, difficulties of access, a history&#13;
o f widespread corruption, and a compromised administrative capacity. Still, some&#13;
experience has been accumulated inimplementingactivities such as those foreseen under&#13;
this component, showing that the obstacles canbe overcome -providedthat a pro-active&#13;
and flexible approach is adopted.&#13;
&#13;
56.     The designo f implementationmechanisms hence draws on lessons learned in&#13;
implementing earlier Bank-financed (and more broadly donor-financed) projects, and in&#13;
particular the EERP, the EMF", and the EESRSP -with a view to: (i)          rapidresults; (ii)&#13;
minimized implementation costs (both management and execution costs), despite the&#13;
dispersion o f activities and access constraints; (iii)&#13;
                                                      transparency inprocurement and&#13;
financial management; and (iv) substantive involvement o f municipal authorities and the&#13;
strengtheningo ftheir capacities.&#13;
&#13;
57.     The proposed arrangements rest ontwo main features:&#13;
&#13;
    e   Full involvement of local authorities in both the selection and implementation of&#13;
        activities. This approach is based on a series of successful experiences under&#13;
        ongoing projects -but it goes one step further. Involvement o f local authorities&#13;
        and stakeholders i s critical not only to ensure adequate selection o f the activities,&#13;
        but also to help resolve implementation-relatedproblems as they arise. It also&#13;
        allows for a full-timepresence o f supervision teams on site at a reduced cost.&#13;
        Furthermore, it lays the foundations for the revitalization o f municipal structures&#13;
        and pilots processes for consultations with stakeholders at a municipal level.&#13;
        Experience suggests that both authorities and stakeholders are able to play such a&#13;
        role -provided that (i)  they receive substantial assistance on technical matters,&#13;
        and (ii) effective control and supervision mechanisms are inplace.&#13;
&#13;
    e    Use ofprivate contractors (rather than accredited NGOs). This approach has&#13;
        beensuccessfully usedunder earlier projects, including inareas that were&#13;
        devastated by the conflict. It has proven possible to identify contractors who are&#13;
        willing and able to carry out such activities, and to proceedto a competitive&#13;
        recruitment on the basis o f simplified procedures for such activities. Contractors'&#13;
        performance i s demonstrating that they are adequately qualified and equipped to&#13;
        execute their contracts, An alternative approach, based on reliance on accredited&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 28 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        NGOs,was considered during project preparation andwas found sub-optimal for&#13;
        three main reasons: (i)   for urbanareas which are relatively easily accessible, this&#13;
        systemwould introduce intermediation costs (anddelays) that may not be&#13;
        necessary; (ii) urbanareas which are difficult to access, most NGOs currently&#13;
                         for&#13;
        charge operating costs which are exceedingly high(inthe range o f 25 to 30&#13;
        percent); (iii) needs to be given to the restart o f activities by the private&#13;
                       priority&#13;
        sector, as such restart i s essential for DRC's recovery and for the development o f&#13;
        the necessary private sector capacity to ensure sustainability o fthe activities&#13;
        financed under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
58.     Under the overall responsibility o f BCECO, implementationwill hence proceed&#13;
as follows (practical modalities are detailed inthe draft operational manual):&#13;
&#13;
        (i) eachofthe18targeturbancenters,BCECOwillrecruitanexperienced&#13;
           For&#13;
        engineer, who will be seconded to municipal authorities for a period o f 15&#13;
        months. These engineers will provide local authorities with technical capacity for&#13;
        both identification and supervision o f activities. They will report to municipal&#13;
        authorities, work closely with the municipal technical institutions, and help&#13;
        strengthenthe capacity o fthese institutions. A small central, technical unit within&#13;
        BCECO will provide the seconded engineers with technical advice as may be&#13;
        needed, and will supervise their activities from a technical standpoint.&#13;
&#13;
        (ii) authorities, inconsultationwithprivatesectorandcivilsociety,willbe&#13;
            Local&#13;
        invited to submit a list o fpriority activities, The seconded engineers will ensure&#13;
        the quality o f such lists (interms o f technical feasibility, elements o f design, and&#13;
        financial estimates). The lists will be subject to a non-objection by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
        (iii) strengthenownershipandaccontability, municipalauthoritiesineach&#13;
             To&#13;
        urbancenter will sign a simplified contractual document with the Government-&#13;
        stipulating the investments to be financed, the expected development objectives&#13;
        and the corresponding measurable performance indicators, and the arrangements&#13;
        devisedby the authorities for operationandmaintenance.&#13;
&#13;
        (iv) BCECO will ensure the procurement of activities at a central level (inorder to&#13;
        maximize private sector participation), but with particular attentionto broadly&#13;
        advertising activities throughout the country (and inparticular innearby large&#13;
        urban centers). Activities will be procured through a competitive process, under&#13;
        works, goods, and services contracts, primarily with private contractors.&#13;
&#13;
        (v) Local authorities (withthe support o fthe seconded engineers) will be&#13;
        responsible for technical supervision o f the contracted activities - and the&#13;
        certification o f invoices. This i s expected to ensure a full-time presence o f&#13;
        supervisors inthe field and facilitate the involvement o f local authorities to&#13;
        address implementation-related issues as they arise -while minimizingtravel&#13;
        (and hence implementation) costs. BCECO will be responsibleto supervise these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

         and to ensure professionalismand transparency.&#13;
&#13;
         (vi) BCECO will proceed to the payment ofthe contractors -withinthe context of&#13;
        procedures clearly specified inits contract with the Government.&#13;
&#13;
         (vii) Implementationwill be accompanied with a strong information campaign, to&#13;
         ensure the effective involvement o f local populations inthe monitoring o f&#13;
         activities. BCECO will ensure that the contractual documents signed by the&#13;
        municipal authorities with the Government are made public and broadly&#13;
         disseminated, including inthe beneficiary urbancenters. BCECO will also be&#13;
        responsible for ensuring that, for each contract, the following elements are both&#13;
        posted on site and broadcasted on local radios: objective o f the activity, name o f&#13;
        the contractor, name ofthe seconded engineer responsible for supervision, amount&#13;
         o f the contract, inception and expected completion dates, payments already made.&#13;
         This has provenbothimportant andeffective to increase accountability and&#13;
        transparency o f both contractors and their supervisors during contracts execution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
59.      The sustainability o f investments such as those financed under the component will&#13;
depend on three critical factors: (i)  institutional capacity to organize and carry out the&#13;
necessary sustainability activities; (ii) financial capacity to fund them; and (iii)political /&#13;
social will to allocate to these activities the type o f resources needed, ina context o f very&#13;
severe financial constraints.&#13;
&#13;
60.      On the institutional side, municipal administrations inmedium-size cities are&#13;
headed by local administrators. These administrators are typically local personalities,&#13;
who are appointed by the Government. The municipal administrationtypically consists&#13;
o f about ten to twenty staff, and i s responsible for organizing the delivery o f basic urban&#13;
services (such as garbage collection, etc.), as well as general administrative functions. It&#13;
has a minimal capacity to contract and supervise basic maintenance o f rehabilitated&#13;
facilities - a capacity which is expected to be further enhanced through transfers o f&#13;
knowledge and experience by the seconded engineers (such transfers will be a critical&#13;
element o ftheir terms o f reference). Local contractors are usually available and able to&#13;
carry out such maintenance activities.&#13;
&#13;
61,      On the financial side, municipal resources are extremely limited, and inpractice&#13;
mostly consist inrevenues raised locally (e.g., on markets, etc.). The basic systems to&#13;
mobilize such limited resources and spend them effectively are inplace, as can be&#13;
demonstrated by the fact that some municipal services are beingprovided- but they may&#13;
not be adequate for funding the operation andmaintenance o f rehabilitated infrastructure.&#13;
A systemof fiscal decentralizationto the level of municipalities is being designed, but&#13;
timewill berequiredfor this system to be effective. Inthe short-term, municipal&#13;
authorities will therefore be required to make a provision for operation and maintenance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 30 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for a three-year period within the envelope available under the component for each&#13;
medium-size city.&#13;
&#13;
62.      O n the commitment side, it i s expected that the participation o f stakeholders inthe&#13;
selection o f investments, the full involvement o f municipal authorities intheir execution,&#13;
and the implementation o f strong information campaigns will combine to create&#13;
incentives for adequate operation and maintenance - since resources will be available.&#13;

          COMPONENT B: SUPPORT TO PROVINCIAL CAPITALS (US$27 MILLION)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overalldesign&#13;
&#13;
64.      The component aims to support the recovery o fbasic services and economic&#13;
activity inmajor provincial urbancenters and their economic hinterland. It will finance&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation and social services delivery inthese urban centers. Emphasis&#13;
will beplacedon actions which canhave a highand rapid impact-and can help generate&#13;
employment opportunities (inparticular, but not exclusively, for former combatants).&#13;
Assistance will focus on those urbancenters which are home to the largest concentrations&#13;
o fpopulation and constitute the main economic hubs inthe provinces, andwhich play a&#13;
particularly important role inthe Government's overall social stabilization strategy.&#13;
Beneficiary cities are: Bandundu(Bandunduprovince), Kananga (Western Kasai),&#13;
Kikwit (Bandundu), Lubumbashi(Katanga), Matadi (Bas-Congo), Mbandaka (Equateur),&#13;
and Mbuji-Mayi (Eastern Kasai).&#13;
&#13;
65.      The component is a scale-up o f similar activities which are being successfully&#13;
implementedunder the EESRSP (for urbanworks inthe four regional capitals ofthe&#13;
Eastern part o f the country). It will provide the resources for the geographical extension&#13;
o f these activities to the six provinces which are not covered under the EESRSP -hence&#13;
ensuringa full country-wide coverage.&#13;
&#13;
66.      Implementation arrangements will be identical to those successfully usedunder&#13;
the EESRSP. It will be implemented under the overall responsibility o f a consulting firm,&#13;
the UrbanRehabilitation Management Firm(URMF), which will be selected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 3 1 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
competitively and will operate under a service contract with the Government. The&#13;
URMFwill receive a list ofpriorities from the Government, carry out the necessary&#13;
technical studies, enter into contractual agreements with private contractors (or&#13;
exceptionally with accredited NGOs) for the execution o fthese activities, and ensure&#13;
supervision andpayment o fthese contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Selection of priority investments&#13;
&#13;
67.     Each provincial capital will be allocated US$3 millionto finance eligible&#13;
activities. It should be underlinedthat needs far exceed this amount -which corresponds&#13;
to about US$3 to US$8 per capita. An alternative was considered duringproject&#13;
preparationwhich consisted inmaking different allocations to each city. It was, however,&#13;
considered sub-optimal for three reasons: (i)     itresultedinallocations insome cities&#13;
which were not sufficient to have a significant impact; (ii)     itconcentrated resources in&#13;
those areas where implementation i s the most challenging (which are often the poorest)&#13;
therefore raising the risks associated with project implementationto an unacceptable&#13;
level; and (iii) it created the risks o fcausing tensions betweenregions, as there is no&#13;
single transparent and objective criteria on which such a differentiated allocation could be&#13;
based- and therefore o f being counterproductive with regardto one o f the Project's key&#13;
objectives, i.e. social stability.&#13;
&#13;
68.     The Government has established a list o fpriority investments withinthe available&#13;
envelopes for each o f the beneficiary urbancenter. The selection o f these investments&#13;
followed the approach successfully used under the EESRSP (for the Easternprovincial&#13;
capitals, not covered under this Project) -interms o fboth selection process and&#13;
eligibility criteria:&#13;
&#13;
    a   Selectionprocess; (i)Government technical team (supported by a specialized&#13;
                                 a&#13;
        consultant) visitedeach o f the cities to conduct a series o f consultations with the&#13;
         local authorities, private sector, civil society, and other relevant stakeholders; (ii)&#13;
         on the basis o f these consultations, the team helped stakeholders develop a list o f&#13;
        priorities which can be financed withinthe allocated envelope (by conducting&#13;
        bothtechnical and financial evaluations, as well as by helping to define broadly-&#13;
         supported criteria for prioritization); and (iii) the list was submitted to the Bank&#13;
         for non-objection.&#13;
&#13;
    a   Eligibility criteria:&#13;
&#13;
             (i)Location of the activities:the component will be strictly implemented in&#13;
             designated priority urban areas;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                  Nature&#13;
             be financed. Selected activities are expected to yield benefits widely&#13;
             distributedwithin the community, and contribute to improving living&#13;
             conditions within the community.&#13;
&#13;
             (iv) Commitment to operation and maintenance. Realistic and sustainable&#13;
             mechanisms for operation andmaintenance (including financing) o fthe&#13;
             rehabilitated infrastructure and facilities have beendevised prior to the&#13;
             selection of the activity, inorder to ensure sustainability. This should include&#13;
             clear financing plans, as well as the namingo f individuals incharge.     '&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
69.     A summary list of selected activities is presentedinAppendix C (each sub-project&#13;
i s supported by technical documentationand a detailed project proposal available at&#13;
UCOP upon request). For each activity, detailed objectives andmeasurable performance&#13;
indicators (including current baseline) have been identified. Selected activities includes:&#13;
social services delivery (e.g., education, health, community centers), economic&#13;
revitalization (e.g., water, markets, slaughterhouses, transport, and energy), and&#13;
environmental and sanitation services (e.g., rehabilitation o f sewage and drainage&#13;
networks). Works, furniture, equipment, supplies, and the delivery o f services (such as&#13;
training o f teachers or nurses, and campaigns to prevent the spread o f infectious diseases)&#13;
will be financed as may be necessary. The list will be transmittedfor executionto the&#13;
URMF, as soon as this firmis recruited. Itmay be adjusted duringimplementationin&#13;
case o f costs over-runs for specific activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Execution of activities&#13;
&#13;
70.     The URMFwill be competitively recruited under terms o f reference identicalto&#13;
those successfully used under the EESRSP. Under these terms o f reference, the Firmwill&#13;
act on behalf o fthe Government and will be responsible for ensuring the effective&#13;
implementation o f the activities selected under the component. Its tasks will inparticular&#13;
include: (i)  preparation o f technical and engineering studies (typically through a contract&#13;
with a specialized engineering firm); (ii)  procurement o fthe activities (establishing a&#13;
detailed procurement plan, preparingbiddingdocuments, managing the procurement&#13;
process inaccordance with Bank rules); (iii)     signingo fthe corresponding contracts; (iv)&#13;
technical supervision o f contract execution (supervision o f works, certification o f&#13;
invoices, etc.), possibly through a contract with a specialized firm; (v) payment o f&#13;
contractors; (vi) communication with local authorities and stakeholders as may be&#13;
needed; (vii) receptiono f works and goods onbehalf o fthe Government; (viii) settingup&#13;
of a monitoring and evaluation system (including baseline data) for the activities financed&#13;
underthe component. Such a system o fdelegation o fimplementation responsibilityto a&#13;
competitively-recruited private entity has proven an effective way to ensure rapid and&#13;
transparent implementation.&#13;
&#13;
71.     Activities will be implemented through competitively-awarded works, goods, and&#13;
services contracts with private contractors. Experienceto date (including inthe most&#13;
conflict-affected provinces) shows that private sector capacity inprovincial capitals i s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 33 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
adequate (or can be brought in) for the implementation o f the activities considered under&#13;
this component. The URMFwill be expectedto demonstrate pro-activity and&#13;
transparency inits dealing with potential contractors, inorder to maximize private sector&#13;
response.&#13;
&#13;
72.     Implementationwill be accompanied with a strong information campaign, to&#13;
ensure the effective involvement o f local populations inthe monitoring o f activities. The&#13;
Firmwill be responsible for ensuring that, for each contract, the following elements are&#13;
bothposted on site andbroadcasted on local radios: objective o f the activity, name o f the&#13;
contractor, cost of the contract, inception and completion dates, payments already made.&#13;
This has provenbothimportant andeffective to increase accountability and transparency&#13;
o f both contractors and their supervisors during contracts execution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
73.     As for activities financed undercomponent A, the sustainability o f investments&#13;
under component B will depend on institutional capacity, financial capacity, political /&#13;
social will.&#13;
&#13;
74,     O nthe institutional side, municipal administrations inprovincial capitals tendto&#13;
be substantially stronger than those inmedium-size cities, with an appointedmayor and a&#13;
municipal administration o f 60 to 80 staff, including some technical capacity. While the&#13;
functioning o fthese administrations could be significantly improved, some basic services&#13;
are being delivered, and there i s a minimal capacity to contract and supervise basic&#13;
maintenance o f rehabilitated facilities. Local contractors are usually available and able to&#13;
carry out such maintenance activities.&#13;
&#13;
75.     Inaddition, specific contractual arrangements will bedesignedto ensure an&#13;
adequate involvement o f the relevant sectoral ministries andtechnical institutions (e.g.,&#13;
the water company, the power company) -whether for technical studies, supervision, or&#13;
operation and maintenance. Such agreements will typically provide these entities with&#13;
the basic financial andtechnical means they need to fulfill these tasks, and specify their&#13;
obligations (including possibly cost recovery targets). They will be signedat a provincial&#13;
or central level, as may be most relevant - betweenthe Government, the URMF (when&#13;
appropriate), and the beneficiary entities. They are expected to provide opportunities for&#13;
capacity strengthening o f institutions which are critical for the continued operation and&#13;
maintenance o f rehabilitated infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
76.     O nthe financial side, provincial and municipal resources are limited, and consist&#13;
of both revenues raised locally (e.g., on markets, etc.) and fiscal retrocessions from the&#13;
central Government. The basic systems to execute public expenditure are inplace, as can&#13;
be demonstrated by the fact that some municipal services are beingprovided. Resources&#13;
are expected to increase inthe years to come, as the process o f fiscal decentralization&#13;
gathers pace, For the short-term, however, an agreement will be reached prior to the start&#13;
of each activity to be financed, by which the local authorities and the relevant technical&#13;
entities will indicate the amount o f resources they will make available for operations and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            - 34 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
maintenance from their own resources - and the amount o f resources which shouldbe&#13;
provisioned within the envelope available under the component for such operations and&#13;
maintenance duringthe lifetime o f the Project.&#13;
&#13;
77.      On the commitment side, it i s once again expected that the participation o f&#13;
stakeholders inthe selection o f investments and the implementation o f strong information&#13;
campaigns will combine to create incentives for adequate operation andmaintenance.&#13;
&#13;
78.      To formalize the commitment to operation and maintenance, each city will be&#13;
required to sign a simplifiedcontractual document with the Government - stipulating the&#13;
investments to be financed and the arrangements devised by the authorities for operation&#13;
and maintenance. Attention will be paidto ensuringthe complementarity o fthese&#13;
contractual documents and those with relevant sectoral ministriesor technical entities&#13;
described above.&#13;

          COMPONENT    c:  CONNECTIVITY TO ISOLATED AREAS(US32 MILLION)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overall design&#13;
&#13;
80.      The component aims to help reconnect two isolatedregions to DRC's main&#13;
transport network, through the rehabilitation o f key transport links -the national road 5&#13;
(RN5) inEastern Katanga and the national road 6 (RN6) inNorthern Equateur. These&#13;
works are expected to substantially reduce transportation costs, andto restore links&#13;
betweenproduction andconsumptionareas (inparticular for agricultural products) -with&#13;
a highexpected impact on agricultural outputs, incomes inrural areas, andprices o f basic&#13;
commodities inurbancenters.&#13;
&#13;
81.      The component is a scale-up o f similar activities which are being successfully&#13;
implementedunder the EESRSP (for the re-opening o ftwo major roads inthe Eastern&#13;
part o f the country) and draws on the experience acquired with implementation o f the&#13;
EERP and E M W for similar works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            - 35 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82.      Implementationarrangements will be identical to those under the EESRSP.&#13;
Works will be grouped inthree large contracts, awarded through a competitive&#13;
procurement process which will be managed by BCECO on behalf o fthe Government.&#13;
Supervisionwill be contracted to two specialized engineering firms, which will operate&#13;
withthe supporto fthe relevant Congolese technical institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Selectionof priority investments&#13;
&#13;
83,      DRC's transport network i s organized around the Congo river and its tributaries,&#13;
which i s complemented by a network o f airport facilities. The pre-war road network was&#13;
essentially designed to "close" the loop formed by the river (through the Route Nationale&#13;
1,RN 1,between Kinshasa and Lubumbashi) and to connect populated areas to the river&#13;
andthe RN 1. It was relatively poorly developed (58,300 kilometers o fnational and&#13;
regional roads, and about 86,600 kilometers o f secondary and rural roads, i.e. a total o f&#13;
145,000 kilometers), and consisted mainly o f earthroads (less than2 percent o f the&#13;
network was paved). Its dilapidation duringthe conflict (due to both damage and lack o f&#13;
maintenance) has resulted inthe isolation o f entire provinces, which have been forced&#13;
into autarky and where living conditions are appalling.&#13;
&#13;
84.      Rehabilitation o f the transport network i s supported under earlier Bank-funded&#13;
projects, mainly the EERP, EMRRP, and EESRSP. After full completion of the works&#13;
financed through these projects, the RN 1 shouldbe passable again from Matadi (the&#13;
country's seaport) to Kinshasato Lubumbashi - andthe links connecting the densely-&#13;
populated Eastern provinces to the Congo river (RN 4) andto the RN 1(RN2) should&#13;
also have beenre-opened. The backbone o fthe system having been reconstituted, the&#13;
next challenge consists inre-connecting isolated regions to this backbone (as spelledout&#13;
inthe PMPTR).&#13;
&#13;
85.      While it would be desirable to launch a large rehabilitation programto re-connect&#13;
all partso f the country, financial constraints impose to prioritize. Inthis context, the&#13;
following criteria were adopted for the selection o fpriorities: (i) o f priority&#13;
                                                                       degree&#13;
expressed by stakeholders during the provincial-level consultations that took place for the&#13;
preparation o fthe PMPTR; (ii)     expected economic and social impact (which should be&#13;
significant  and could materialize rapidly); (iii) feasibility o f implementation within a&#13;
relative short period o f time; and (iv) scope o f work.&#13;
&#13;
86.      On the basis o f these criteria, two road sections were selected:&#13;
&#13;
    e    The 220-kilometer highway Lubumbashi -Kasenga (later on referred to as RN 5)&#13;
         intheKatangaprovince. Thisisthe only connectionbetweenthe easternhalfof&#13;
         the Katangaprovince (which is inhabited by about 2 to 3 millionpeople and has&#13;
         beenparticularly affected duringthe conflict) andthe provincial capital,&#13;
         Lubumbashi(and from there to the rest o fthe country and SouthernAfrican&#13;
         neighboring countries). The rehabilitaton o f RN5 i s expected to spur economic&#13;
         activity inrural areas where pre-warlivelihoods depended on the ability to market&#13;
         production to Lubumbashi and other miningareas inKatanga (and to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 36 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         accompanied by a significant increase inthe number o f goods available ineastern&#13;
         Katanga, as well as by a decrease intheir prices).&#13;
&#13;
         The 390-kilometer highway Zongo - Gemena-Akula (later on referred to as RN&#13;
         6) inthe Equateur province. This is the only connectionbetweenthe northern&#13;
         half o f the Equatew province (which i s inhabited by about 4 million people and&#13;
         has beenparticularly affected during the conflict) andthe Congo river (andhence&#13;
         the rest ofthe country). Inview ofthe current condition o fthis road, transport to&#13;
         northern Equateur i s currently not possible from the Congo river. As a result,&#13;
         most locally-produced goods cannot be transported to pre-war markets, and most&#13;
         basic commodities and commercial suppliesare imported from the Central&#13;
         African Republic (itself a landlocked country .withpoor infrastructure), with a&#13;
         significant impact on both prices and availability, and hence on economic activity,&#13;
         food security, andpoverty. The re-opening o fthe RN 6 i s expected to spur&#13;
         economic activity, andto be accompanied by a significant increase inthe number&#13;
         o f goods available innorthernEquateur, as well as by a decrease intheir prices&#13;
         (comparable to what has happened inother areas where the re-opening o f key&#13;
         transport networks as resulted to drop inprices o f as much as 50 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Natureof the activitiesfinancedunder the component&#13;
&#13;
87.      Inview ofthe magnitude ofthe needsandofthe limitedresources available under&#13;
the Project, efforts havebeenmade to identify lowest-cost technical solutions, including&#13;
by limitingthe standards of rehabilitationto the strict minimumrequiredfor rendering a&#13;
minimal level o f services (i.e., the standard for road rehabilitation will be "passable at an&#13;
average o f 30 to 40 k"'). works will also be designedand plannedto optimize the&#13;
                                The&#13;
use o f the resources available, by prioritizing repairs and focusing on the most critical&#13;
bottlenecks, which can be removed within the available allocation. The type o f activities&#13;
financed under the component will require only limitedtechnical studies (as the objective&#13;
i s to make an earth road passable again in all seasons, rather than to fully rehabilitate and&#13;
upgrade it) -with a view to completing works within 18 months.&#13;
&#13;
88.      Rehabilitation works will aim to ensure that the priority sections o f RN5 and RN&#13;
6 become passable again inall seasons (prior to the conflict, these roads were unpaved&#13;
highway, about 7-meter wide). Based on experience to date and initial technical studies,&#13;
six types of rehabilitation works have beenidentified: (i)   rehabilitation o f key bridgesand&#13;
crossings; (ii) repairs o f the most damaged sections (e.g., where the road has collapsed&#13;
due to landslides), for a total lengthestimated at about 80 kilometers; (iii)   patching on&#13;
less damaged paved sections (e.g., major holes) and clearing vegetation; (iv) backfilling&#13;
on about 20 percent of the road; (v) levelling with filling on about 40 percent o fthe road;&#13;
and (vi) cleaning o f ditches and maintenance o f shoulders on the entire highway.&#13;
&#13;
89.      Itis expected that complementary financing for the rehabilitation ofRN6 willbe&#13;
provided by the European Commission for a 60-km section around Gemena. These&#13;
works will be closely coordinated with those undertaken under the Project.&#13;

Implementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
90.     The detailed technical design o fthe works for bothRN 5 andRN6 i s under&#13;
preparationby the Government's road agency (Ofice des Routes) -which had&#13;
successfully completed a similar task for the re-openingo f RN2 andRN4 under the&#13;
EESRSP. The OfJice des Routes has sent technical teams inthe field to assess the&#13;
physicalcondition of each road, identify priority rehabilitationworks, and set the&#13;
technical elements o f design. This work i s beingfinalized and will be reviewed by an&#13;
independentconsultant to ensure its quality.&#13;
&#13;
91.     On the basis o f this design, works will be contracted through a competitive&#13;
procurement process managed by BCECO on behalf o fthe Government. Inorder to&#13;
allow for economies o f scale, as well as to maximize opportunities for Congolese&#13;
companies to participate inthe biddingprocess, works on RN5 will be awarded inone&#13;
lot, while works on RN6 will be awarded intwo lots (Eastern and Western half&#13;
respectively).&#13;
&#13;
92.     Supervisionwill be contracted to two specialized engineeringfirms, for RN5 and&#13;
RN6 respectively (the engineer for RN6 will supervise bothlots). These firms will be&#13;
selected by BCECO through a competitive process. It i s expected that the Office des&#13;
Routes will play an important role duringimplementationandwork closely with the&#13;
supervisor to help inthe day-to-day supervision o fthe works as well as with additional&#13;
designas may be needed. The Ofice des Routes is carrying out similar activities under&#13;
the EESRSP. Such activities are expected to contribute to gradually restoringpre-war&#13;
capacity and further strengthen this institution once renowned inSub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
93,     The Government is working withthe Bank on designingandputtinginplace a&#13;
country-wide systemfor road maintenance (studies are underway under the EMW).&#13;
The establishment o fthis system, however, is expected to take time. The Project will&#13;
therefore finance maintenance o f the rehabilitated infrastructure for a thirty-month&#13;
period. Such maintenance will be contracted as part o fthe rehabilitation contract,&#13;
through a performance-based arrangement with an agreed level o f service (average speed&#13;
o f 30 to 40 km/hfor a truck throughout the itineraries). Maintenance is expected to rely&#13;
to a large extent on communities living along the roads -but particular attention will be&#13;
paid to ensuring that people employed inthis context receive a fair compensation for their&#13;
work (since the use o f coerced labor for regular highway maintenance has often been&#13;
common practice insome parts o f DRC).&#13;

        COMPONENT SUPPORT TO PROVINCIAL&#13;
                       D:                               INSTITUTIONS   (US$7 MILLION)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overall design&#13;
&#13;
95.     The component aims to helpkey institutions at a provincial level upgrade their&#13;
capacities, within the context o f a broader, multi-donor effort. It will finance activities in&#13;
provincial capitals - for key institutions at the level of each province - including: (i)&#13;
basic training; (ii)equipment (e.g., information technology, office supplies); and (iii)&#13;
minimal rehabilitation of office facilities (e.g., waterproofing). The selection of activities&#13;
will be based on a detailed, institution-specific technical assessmento frelative needs&#13;
across provinces, and across institutions.&#13;
&#13;
96.     This component builds on the successful implementation experience o f similar&#13;
activities financed by the Bank (under the EERPand the EESRSP), the European&#13;
Commission, Belgium,the Netherlands, Sweden, andthe UnitedKingdom, as well as the&#13;
Government o f DRC (for a total o f about US$12 million), inparticular to support the&#13;
settingup of transitional institutions inKinshasainlate 2003 to early 2004. Such support&#13;
proved critical to the successful installation of these institutions, and the startingup o f&#13;
their activities. The component will providethe resources for the extensionof such&#13;
activities to the provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
97.     Implementation arrangements will be identical to those under component B. The&#13;
URMFwill receive the list o f activities to be implemented from the Government, carry&#13;
out the necessary technical studies, enter into contractual agreements with private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 3 9 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
contractors (or exceptionally with accredited NGOs) for the execution o f these activities,&#13;
and ensure supervision andpayment o fthese contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Selection of priorities&#13;
&#13;
98.     Giventhe magnitude o fneeds compared to the resources available under the&#13;
component, setting priorities i s critical. To that effect, the following criteria will apply:&#13;
&#13;
        Priorities acrossprovinces. Resources available under the component will be&#13;
        directed inpriority to those provinces which have relatively less financial means&#13;
        to cope with the current situation. The distribution o f financial assistance under&#13;
        the component across provinces will therefore be inversely correlated with the&#13;
        retrocession of fiscal resources from the Government to each province and will&#13;
        focus on those provinces with the lowest amount o f resources. A table&#13;
        summarizing allocations for each province can be found inAppendix C.&#13;
&#13;
        Priorities across institutions in a givenprovince. Inorder to prevent a dispersion&#13;
        o f activities across a large number o f institutions but with a limited overall&#13;
        impact, resources available under the component will be directed at three to four&#13;
        institutions ineach province. These institutions will be selected by the provincial&#13;
        authorities, inconsultation with local stakeholders, and subject to a non-objection&#13;
        by the Bank. Selectioncriteria are expected to includeneeds, relative importance&#13;
        o f the institution, its relevance for poverty reduction, as well as the quality o f its&#13;
        management.&#13;
&#13;
        Priorities across activitiesfor a given institution. Support will be provided within&#13;
        the context ofa result-drivenperformanceimprovement plan-which will be&#13;
        formalized through a contractual document and will include measures to be taken&#13;
        by management as well as the comprehensive package o fworks, goods, and&#13;
        services necessary for the targeted results (interms o f improved service delivery)&#13;
        to be achieved.&#13;
&#13;
99.     Inthis context, the identificationand selection o factivities are based onproposals&#13;
by provincial authorities, verified and aggregated at Government level. The process&#13;
consists o fthree steps: (i)  information o f provincial authorities and request for proposals;&#13;
(ii) byatechnicalteam(supportedbyaspecializedconsultant) fromtheGovernment&#13;
   visit&#13;
to each provincial capital; and (iii)  aggregation and submissionto the Bank for non-&#13;
objection. This work i s expected to be completed before effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implementation&#13;
&#13;
100,    The first step o f implementation will be the preparation and the signing o f a&#13;
contract between the Government and the relevant provincial entity. This contract will&#13;
specify the results to be achieved (withquantifiedperformance indicators), the measures&#13;
to be taken by management, as well as the support to be provided under the component&#13;
(interms ofworks, goods, andservices, as may be appropriate).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 40 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
101.     Once these activities have been identifiedand aggregated at national level, in&#13;
order to limit implementation andmanagement costs, they will be executed by the&#13;
URMF, which will be recruitedfor the execution o fcomponent B. The tasks and&#13;
responsibilities of the URMFwill be identicalto those under component B.&#13;
&#13;
102.     Inthe provinces which are not covered under component B(Province Orientale,&#13;
Nord Kivu, Sud Kivu, and Maniema, which were covered under the EESRSP), activities&#13;
will be implemented either by the URMF or by the engineering company which is&#13;
already active inthese four provinces to implement the EESRSP component 4 (which i s&#13;
identicalto component B under the Project) -the lowest-cost option will be selected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
103,     The sustainability o f investmentsunder component Dwill depend mainly on&#13;
financial capacity. Indeed, since the investments will benefit primarilyto priority&#13;
institutions at the provincial level, political will i s not expected to be an issue. Technical&#13;
capacity i s also available at the level o fprovinces. These provinces are headed by a&#13;
Governor (appointed within the context o fthe political agreement between the various&#13;
groups represented inthe Inter-Congolese dialogue) who i s assisted by two vice-&#13;
Governors (also appointed withinthe same context, and belonging to different political&#13;
groups). The Governor has a staff o f qualified technicians, andrelies on technical entities&#13;
at the provincial levels (including provincial branches of sectoral ministries) - a total o f&#13;
about 100 people inaverage.&#13;
&#13;
104.     Onthe financial side, provincial resources consist o f fiscal retrocessions from the&#13;
central Government. These resources are expected to increase inthe coming years, as&#13;
fiscal decentralization deepens - and they are expected to be sufficient to cover the basic&#13;
operations and maintenance of the investment financed under the component.&#13;

                               IMPLEMENTATION       ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Overallimplementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
107.      Giventhe emergency nature andthe complexity o fthe Project, as well as the&#13;
limitson institutional capacity inDRC,overall implementationarrangements will rest on&#13;
existingentities, which have demonstrated their ability to carry out the corresponding&#13;
tasks andwhich have sufficient capacity to effectively increase the scope o ftheir&#13;
activities without being overburdened. Such a pragmatic approach i s expected to&#13;
facilitate rapid implementation (as appropriate under an emergency program) and the&#13;
reaching o f multi-sectoral objectives, as well as to ensure adequate transparency. The&#13;
proposed distribution o f roles and responsibilitiesamong existing entities reflects the&#13;
experience acquired inimplementing the EERP, EMRRP, and the EESRSP - andi s&#13;
based on an assessment o f each entity's respective strengths andweaknesses.&#13;
&#13;
108.      Inthis context, Project implementation arrangements will bebasedon a&#13;
delegation o f implementation responsibilitiesto technical entities andprivate consulting&#13;
f i r m s wherever possible. Overall implementationwill use the same arrangements as the&#13;
EESRSP -which rest on three key entities:&#13;
&#13;
      a   TheProject Coordination Unit (Unit6 de Coordination du Projet, UCOP). UCOP&#13;
          will be the Bank's maincounterpart and focal point for implementation ofthe&#13;
          Project. It will be responsible for: (i) oversight o f implementation; (ii)&#13;
                                                   overall&#13;
          coordination with technical ministriesand other relevant entities for the successful&#13;
          implementation of all components; (iii)    financial management; and (iv) liaison&#13;
          withthe Bank. UCOP is successfully handlingidentical responsibilities under the&#13;
          EESRSP.&#13;
&#13;
          UCOP was established by presidential decree (decree 03/23 dated September 10,&#13;
          2003). It i s a relatively light unit, which relies heavily on sub-contracting&#13;
          implementationto other entities. It i s composed o f a technical division (with four&#13;
          professional staff) and an administrative and finance division (with five&#13;
          professional staff), which work under the authority o f the UCOP coordinator.&#13;
          Key staff have beenrecruitedthroughtransparent and competitive procedures. Its&#13;
          operational and financial management manuals andprocedures have been&#13;
          prepared with World Bank assistance and are up to international standards. For&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      the purposes o f implementing the Project, it will be strengthenedwith two&#13;
      technical staff and one administrative / finance staff (inthe relevant divisions).&#13;
&#13;
   a   TheInterministerial Oversight Committee (Comiti Interministiriel de&#13;
      Supervision, CIS). The CIS oversees UCOP activities, with a focus on&#13;
       effectiveness and transparency, provides overall guidance as may be needed, and&#13;
       facilitates the coordination o f the various public institutions involved inthe&#13;
      EESRSP. The CIS is expected to play anidenticalrole under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
      The CIS was established by the samepresidentialdecree which created UCOP. It&#13;
      includes the Ministers o f Finance, Budget, Plan, Economy, Public Works,&#13;
      Transport, Rural Development, Social Affairs, and Humanitarian Affairs, and the&#13;
      Economic Adviser to the President, or their representatives. It i s chaired by the&#13;
      Minister o f Plan or hisrepresentative. It meets inaverage every quarter. It i s&#13;
       supported by a technical committee (ComitC Technique des Experts), which was&#13;
      established by the same presidential decree, and consists o f representatives o f&#13;
      various technical entities.&#13;
&#13;
   a   TheBureau Central de Coordination (BCECO). BCECO will act as a&#13;
      procurement agent for all contracts to be awarded directly by the Government&#13;
      under the Project (terms o f reference and specifications will be provided by&#13;
      UCOP, contracts will be signed by UCOP and supervised under UCOP's&#13;
      responsibility) -inaddition to its specific responsibilities for implementation o f&#13;
      component A as described below. It will enter into a contractual agreement with&#13;
      UCOP to that effect. BCECO i s successfully managing the procurement o f&#13;
       similar contracts under the EESRSP.&#13;
&#13;
      BCECO was established in2001, with particular support from the Bank, Belgium,&#13;
      and Canada. It is an independent institution (interms o f both financial operations&#13;
       andday-to-day management), established to manage small scale rehabilitation&#13;
      projects financed by boththe DRC Government and donors. BCECO i s reporting&#13;
      to a Steering Committee, chairedby the Minister o f Finance or hisrepresentative,&#13;
       and composed of key ministerswith economic and social portfolios, as well as a&#13;
      representative o f the Presidency. BCECO has been staffed through transparent&#13;
       and competitive procedures. Its operational, procurement, andfinancial&#13;
      management manuals and procedures have beenprepared with World Bank&#13;
      assistance and are up to international standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implementationarrangementsfor each component&#13;
&#13;
109.  As described above, implementation arrangements are identical to those inuse&#13;
underthe EESRSP -for components B, CyandD-or constitute slight variations onthese&#13;
arrangements to reflect lessons from experience -for component A. The paragraphs&#13;
below summarize the mainimplementation responsibilities (also see Graph 4 below):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 43 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        ComponentA: Support to medium urban centers. The component will be&#13;
        implementedby BCECO, under a service contract betweenUCOP and BCECO.&#13;
        BCECO will be responsible for all aspects o f implementation (including&#13;
        procurement and financial management) and will report to UCOP - except for the&#13;
        preparation o f contractual arrangements between the Government and the&#13;
        beneficiary entities which will be UCOP's responsibility. For the purposes o f&#13;
        implementing the component, BCECO will set up a specific operational unit,&#13;
        which will include a technical supervision, a procurement, and a financial&#13;
        management element. It will also recruit and second to municipal authorities an&#13;
        experienced engineer for eachtarget urbancenter.&#13;
&#13;
        Component B: Support toprovincial capitals. The component will be&#13;
        implementedthrough a services contract between UCOP and a specialized firm,&#13;
        the URMF. The URMFwill berecruitedthrough a competitive process managed&#13;
        by BCECO (inits capacity ofprocurement agent for the Project), onthe basis of&#13;
        terms o f reference identical to those successfully used under the EESRSP. The&#13;
        URMFwill act onbehalf ofthe Government. Itwill contract private enterprises&#13;
        for the execution o fthe activities supported under the component andwill be&#13;
        responsible for all aspects o f implementation -except for the preparation o f&#13;
        contractual arrangements between the Government and the beneficiary entities&#13;
        which will be UCOP's responsibility. Itwill follow a set o f procurement and&#13;
        financial management procedures specified inits contract and acceptable to the&#13;
        Bank.&#13;
&#13;
        Component C: Connectivity to isolated areas. The component will be&#13;
        implementedunder UCOP's responsibility, with BCECO acting as procurement&#13;
        agent. Based on technical specifications provided by UCOP (supported by the&#13;
        Government's road agency for technical designs), BCECO will manage a&#13;
        competitive procurement process to recruit three contractors (one for RN5 and&#13;
        two for RN6) and two engineering firms to supervise the works (one for RN 5&#13;
        and RN6 each). Contracts will be signed by UCOP, which will be responsible&#13;
        for monitoring the execution o fthe contracts, for ensuring the payment o fthe&#13;
        contractors, and for managing the related financial management tasks.&#13;
&#13;
        ComponentD: Support toprovincial institutions. This component will be&#13;
        implemented under the same arrangements as component B - i.e., through the&#13;
        service contract with the URMF (andpossibly with the similar firm which i s&#13;
        implementing activities under the EESRSP inthe four Easternprovinces). The&#13;
        URMFwill act on behalfo fthe Government andwill be responsible for all&#13;
        aspects o f implementation as described above - except for the preparation o f&#13;
        contractual arrangements between the Government andthe beneficiary entities&#13;
        whichwill be UCOP's responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
110.    Particular attention will be paidto ensuringclose coordination with other Bank-&#13;
financed projects, especially sectoral projects - so as to maximize synergies. To that&#13;
effect, UCOP will ensure a regular flow o f informationto relevant sectoral ministriesand&#13;

technical institutions (and inparticular copy all its reports to these entities), and will meet&#13;
with other implementation agencies on a regular basis. The Bank team will also ensure&#13;
that all reports are adequately copied to all relevant Bank staff.&#13;

Operational manual&#13;
&#13;
111.    UCOP will finalize by effectiveness an operational manual for the Project, which&#13;
i s expected to include: (i)description o f the relationship betweenthe various actors&#13;
                                 a&#13;
involved inimplementation; (ii)          a detailed description o f procurement and financial&#13;
management procedures to be followed by each actor; (iii)            a description o f specific&#13;
arrangements for key activities under each component. This manual i s expected to draw&#13;
largely on the existing EESRSP manual (which has proven adequate for this project and&#13;
i s effectively used inpractice), adjusted to the new project as may be needed. To ensure&#13;
transparency, copies o f the operational manual will be broadly disseminated and&#13;
discussed with each entity relevant for project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reviews&#13;
&#13;
112.     Withinthe context ofregular implementationsupport missions, implementation&#13;
mechanisms andthe operational manual will be reviewedby IDA on a semiannual basis.&#13;
Itis expected that implementation arrangements may evolve duringthe course of&#13;
implementation as Congolese institutions strengthentheir capacities, and especially after&#13;
the elections. The relevant adjustmentswill hence bemade as may be necessary, to&#13;
reflect such changes inthe situation on the ground as well as the experience acquired&#13;
during each phase o f implementation. This, however, is not expected to include changes&#13;
inthe procurementandfinancial management arrangements described inthis document,&#13;
nor to change the major principles underlyingthe design o f the Project.&#13;
&#13;

                               PROCUREMENTARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
General&#13;
&#13;
113.    The Project will finance works, goods, services, and operatingcosts. Procurement&#13;
will be conducted inaccordance with IDA guidelines -"Guidelines: Procurement Under&#13;
IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 and "Guidelines: Selection and&#13;
Employment of Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers" also dated May 2004 -as well as&#13;
with the provisions stipulated inthe LegalAgreement. For each contract to be financed&#13;
under the Project, the different procurementor consultant selection methods, the needfor&#13;
prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed&#13;
betweenthe Government andthe Bank inthe Procurement Plan (see Appendix D). The&#13;
Procurement Planwill be updated at least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual&#13;
project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
114.    A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was preparedby the&#13;
Government with World Bank support andpresented at a workshop heldinMay 2004&#13;
This assessment identifiedmajor flaws inthe country's procurement rules andsystems -&#13;
with outdated procedures and compromised administrative capacity. While remedial&#13;
measures are beingdesigned and implemented (withBank support under the EESRSP),&#13;
national procedures cannot be used for the purposes o f implementing Bank-financed&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
115.    Overall, procurement arrangements for the Project buildon experience to date&#13;
with earlier Bank-financedprojects (and inparticular the EESRSP). This includes&#13;
procurement methods and ceilings which are identical or similar (as may be relevant) to&#13;
those successfully used underthe EESRSP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procurement responsibilities&#13;
&#13;
116.    UCOP will delegate procurement responsibility to specialized entities as&#13;
described above -and will not be directly involved inprocurement. UCOP will sign all&#13;
contracts directly awarded by the Government (which will be procured by BCECO) - Le.&#13;
a total o f 7 contracts (1 contract with the URMFunder component B, 3 contracts of&#13;
works and 2 contracts o f supervision under component Cy1contract for an external&#13;
audit). UCOP will also enter into a service agreement with BCECO (as implementing&#13;
agency for component A), and into service agreements with relevant Congolese entities&#13;
to associate them inthe execution o f activities financed under the Project (the service&#13;
agreement with BCECO as a procurement agent i s already signed and financed under the&#13;
EESRSP).&#13;
&#13;
117.    Procurement responsibilities for each component are described inthe matrix&#13;
below:&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procurementmethods&#13;
&#13;
118.     Procurement methods are described inAppendix D. They will rely on&#13;
competitive process -namely International Competitive Bidding (ICB), National&#13;
Competitive Bidding(NCB), National Shopping (NS), and quotations methods for goods&#13;
and services; Quality-Cost Based Selection (QCBS) andConsultant's Qualification (CQ)&#13;
for consultants and service agreements. IDA will conduct prior reviews and post reviews&#13;
(including through two procurement supervision missions) as described inAppendix D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              DISBURSEMENT      ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
119.     The IDA Grant will finance 100percent o f all expenditures,net o ftaxes and&#13;
duties, except for operating costs (project management) for which payment o ftaxes and&#13;
duties i s permissible - as allowed under the Country Financing Parameters for DRC. The&#13;
disbursement schedule i s expected to be as follows: 12percent inFY06,29 percent in&#13;
FY07, 31 percent inFY08,21 percent inFY09, and 7 percent inFY10.&#13;
&#13;
120.     The proposeddisbursement arrangements are similar to those which are&#13;
successfully used under the EESRSP. They include the setting up o f a special account, as&#13;
well as direct payment for large contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specialaccount&#13;
&#13;
121.     To facilitate implementation and reduce the volume o f withdrawal applications, a&#13;
Special Account will be opened inU S dollars ina commercial bank on terms and&#13;
conditions acceptable to IDA. The Special Account will be managed by UCOP (which&#13;
has built a solid track record o f doing so underthe EESRSP) andwill finance eligible&#13;
expenditures, Le.: (i)  expenditure relatedto the management o f the Project by UCOP; (ii)&#13;
payments to OfJice des Routes for its participation inthe supervision o f Component C -&#13;
andpossibly to other technical entities as may be apropriate to carry out similar activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
under component B; and (iii)   supervision contracts under component C as described&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
122.    For the Special Account, the authorized allocation will be US$0.6 million&#13;
correspondingto about four months o f eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, IDA&#13;
will make an initial deposit, inthe amount o fUS$0.3 millioninto the Special Account,&#13;
representingfifty percent o fthe authorized allocation. The remaining balance will be&#13;
made available when the aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the grant account plus&#13;
the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association&#13;
shall be equal or exceed the equivalent o f US$2 million. Further deposits by IDA into&#13;
the Special Accounts will be made against monthly withdrawal applications supportedby&#13;
appropriate documents. Withdrawal applications will be signed by authorized&#13;
representatives o f the Borrower, as designated by the Minister o f Finance, which are&#13;
expected to be the UCOP Coordinator and the Minister o f Finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Complementaryarrangementsfor component A (supportto mediumurban&#13;
centers),componentB (supportto provincialcapitals),and component D (support&#13;
to provincialinstitutions)&#13;
&#13;
123.    Payments to BCECO (for its role under component A) and the URMF (for&#13;
components B and D) will be made directly by the Bank. Detailedpayment conditions&#13;
will be specified inthe respective service agreements betweenUCOP and these entities.&#13;
These entities will be expected to submit an invoice on a quarterly basis to UCOP in&#13;
accordance with the payment terms stipulated inthe contract and incompliance with&#13;
Bank procurement procedures. The invoices will distinguish betweenthe management&#13;
fee for the component (calculated on the basis o f specifications inthe respective service&#13;
agreements) and the funds released to finance the actual implementation o f activities&#13;
financed under the component (supported by an exhaustive list and cost details o f&#13;
activities, andbased on payment modalities specified inthe respective service&#13;
agreements). Upon receipt o f these invoices, UCOP will forward them to the Bank&#13;
withintenworking days for direct payment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Complementaryarrangementsfor componentC (connectivityto isolatedareas)&#13;
&#13;
124.    Disbursement arrangements will distinguish between two types o f contracts:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Works contracts: payments will be made directly by the Bank; the contractors will&#13;
         submittheir invoices to UCOP, who will certify them andwill forward themto&#13;
        the Bank within ten working days for payment;&#13;
&#13;
    0    Supervision (service contracts): payments will be made out o fthe Special&#13;
        Account; the contractors will submit their invoices to UCOP, who will certify&#13;
        them andpay them through the Special Account.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Use of Statementof Expenditures(SOEs)&#13;
&#13;
125.    Disbursementsfor all expenditures will be made against full documentation,&#13;
except for items of expenditures for: (a) contracts for works inan amount inferior to&#13;
US$500,000; (b) contracts for equipment and goods inan amount inferior to&#13;
US$250,000; (c) contracts for consulting firms inan amount inferior to US$lOO,OOO and&#13;
contracts for individual consultants inan amount inferior to US$50,000 equivalent, as&#13;
well as all operating costs, which will be claimed on the basis o f Statement o f&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;

      FINANCIAL    MANAGEMENT,      FINANCIAL   MONITORING      REPORTS AND AUDITS&#13;
&#13;
FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
126.    UCOP, BCECO, and the URMFwill be responsible for financial management.&#13;
The financial management system o fUCOP and BCECO are satisfactory. UCOP will be&#13;
reinforcedwith an internal audit function (outsources to a private auditor) The effective&#13;
establishment (including recruitment o f key staff) o f a financial management system&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition for the contract with the URMFto be&#13;
executed beyondthe first three months after signature o fthis contract. Details are&#13;
provided inAppendix E.&#13;
&#13;
127.    Payments to contractors under components A, B, C, and D will be processed as&#13;
per standard practices. Payment modalities will be described indetail inthe operations&#13;
manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FinancialMonitoringReports(FMRs)&#13;
&#13;
128.    UCOP will be asked to submit quarterly FMRswithin45 days following the first&#13;
day o f each calendar quarter after effectiveness. The formats and the content o fthe&#13;
FMRsand ofthe Annual Financial Statements have been discussed andagreed upon.&#13;
&#13;
AnnualAudits&#13;
&#13;
129.    UCOP will be responsible for organizing the annual audits for the project. The&#13;
annual financial statements, the movements inthe Special Account and the Statements o f&#13;
Expenditures(SOEs) o f each implementation agency will be auditedby an external&#13;
auditor selected on terms o f references acceptable to IDA. The terms o f references for&#13;
the external auditor will be based on those found acceptable by the Bankunder the&#13;
EESRSP. The Auditor will express separate opinion on each implementation agency&#13;
involved inthe project and the report will be submittedto IDA within six months after&#13;
the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Readiness for implementation&#13;
&#13;
130.   Usingthe flexibility existingunder IDAprocedures, the Government hastaken&#13;
steps to preparefor implementation so as to ensure a rapid launch o f activities financed&#13;
underthe Project once it is approved. Inparticular, procurement o f all key contracts is&#13;
well underway(all procurementdocuments specify that the award ofthe contracts is&#13;
conditional to approval o f the Project by the Board and effectiveness o f the Grant).&#13;
EESRSPresources are also being usedtojump-start activities which are onthe critical&#13;
path (as was foreseen under component 2 o f the EESRSP).&#13;
&#13;
131.   As o fApril 2005, the situationis as follows:&#13;

136.   Regular reviews will be carried out every 12months after effectiveness to assess&#13;
progress, achievement o f overall objectives, and the respective roles of the different&#13;
partnersandto reorient the Project ifneededto ensure achievement o f objectives. The&#13;
reviews will involve visits by specialists to selected sites for first-hand assessment o f&#13;
executing entities' performance. UCOP will be responsible for: (i)      preparingthe&#13;
necessary documentation for the reviews, and (ii)     planningthe review meeting. In&#13;
particular,UCOP will contract a consultant (under project finance) to review and assess&#13;
the progress ofimplementation andprepare the necessary documentation for the periodic&#13;
reviews. UCOP will also organize meetings with implementing partners andkey&#13;
stakeholders and direct beneficiaries, for the supervision mission to receive direct&#13;
feedback from all relevant parties.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    ENVIRONMENTAL      ASPECTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH BANKSAFEGUARD POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
137.    The Project is classified as environmentalcategory Bbecause activities funded&#13;
underthe Project are not expected to have a significant negative environmental or social&#13;
impact (the EESRSP which included similar infrastructure rehabilitation activities&#13;
received a similar classification). No new major constructioni s envisaged (rather the&#13;
Project will support the rehabilitation and reconstructiono f deteriorated and damaged&#13;
infrastructure). The Project i s expected to trigger two Safeguard Policies (environmental&#13;
assessment and involuntary resettlement) andthe following documents will be prepared:&#13;
(i) componentCyanEnvironmentalandSocialAssessment(ESIA);(ii)&#13;
   for                                                                       for&#13;
components A, Byand D, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)&#13;
and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).&#13;
&#13;
138.    As has beenthepractice with other emergency operations processedunder&#13;
OP8.50 inpost-conflict countries, these documents will be financed under the Project and&#13;
will beprepared, reviewed by the Bank and disclosed incountry and inthe Infoshop&#13;
withinone year o feffectiveness (as per OP8.50). Itis expected that they will buildto a&#13;
substantial degree on the safeguard documentation currently under preparation for the&#13;
EESRSP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                          BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
139.   The Project is expected to provide a number o fmajor benefits, which are expected&#13;
to contribute to a successful process o f recovery andtransition inDRC:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Re-capitalize urban assets (under components A and B). Although it i s premature&#13;
       to calculate economic and financial benefits for individual investments insuch a&#13;
       disruptedenvironment, cost data reported byNGOsworking inDRC suggest that&#13;
       the urbanrehabilitationproposed underthe Projectwill have a highpositive&#13;
       retum. This is expected to contribute to preventing the further deterioration of&#13;
       social indicators and help mitigate the social crisis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Re-connect isolated areas (under component C). Experience inDRC shows that&#13;
       the re-opening o ftransport infrastructure results ina significant lowering ofprices&#13;
       of basic supplies and inthe revival of economic activity inthe re-connected areas.&#13;
       Although this is difficult to quantify with exactitude inan environment as&#13;
       disrupted as DRC,retum on such investments has proven disproportionately high&#13;
       -includingonlivingconditionsandsocialstability.&#13;
&#13;
    0  Provide employment opportunities. Experience inother countries suggests that&#13;
       some 20 percent o f funds under the Project will returnto local labor (often very&#13;
       small community businesses and poor laborers). Thus, approximately US$15&#13;
       million will be given as direct wages to the rural poor.&#13;
&#13;
    e  Enhance thefunctioning ofpublic institutions. This includes specific support to&#13;
       be provided to provincial institutions under component D; efforts to strengthen&#13;
       the Office des Routes and other relevanttechnical entities by fully involving this&#13;
       institution intechnical design and supervision o f works; and activities to be&#13;
       carried out under component A to provide local authorities with technical support&#13;
       and empower them to design and supervise small scale rehabilitation activities. It&#13;
       also includes the anti-corruption strategy to be implemented under the Project,&#13;
       through a pro-active information campaign that strengthens accountability o f local&#13;
       institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Generate information for follow-on programs. Management and economic&#13;
       information gathered duringthe implementationperiod will be critical for&#13;
       preparing follow-on programs aimed at supporting war-affected communities.&#13;

&#13;
140.    The proposedProject i s a high-risk,high-gain enterprise. Research and&#13;
experience show that external assistance can play a key role inconsolidating fragile post-&#13;
conflict situations and facilitating economic recovery. The risks o f engagement have&#13;
hence to be balanced with the risks o f inaction, which are considerable. The approach&#13;
suggested here consists inadopting a pro-active risk mitigation strategy rather than a risk&#13;
avoidance approach -that i s to identify key factors o f risks and design ways to minimize&#13;
their potential impact.&#13;
&#13;
141.    Through consultations with bothother donors and Congolese stakeholders, Bank&#13;
staff have identified two maintypes o f risks:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Country-level risks. These include:&#13;
&#13;
        (i)Theriskthatthepoliticaltransitionprocessstalls,withasignificantimpact&#13;
        on security conditions and eventually on political stability. This wouldjeopardize&#13;
        the achievements ofthe Project's objective -althoughit may not annul some of&#13;
        the Project's expectedpositive outcomes (e.g., rehabilitation oflocal&#13;
        infrastructure). This risk has, however, been diminishingover the last four years.&#13;
&#13;
        The Bank will carefully monitor political developments inthe DRC and its&#13;
        neighbors, with a view to scaling back, suspending programs, or shifting focus&#13;
        elsewhere ifpolitical instability or renewedconflict threatens the achievement o f&#13;
        objectives.&#13;
&#13;
        (ii)Therisksassociatedwiththefragilityof thesecuritysituationinsomeareas.&#13;
        Some Project areas may be affectedby renewed insecurity during&#13;
        implementation. Insuch a context, there i s a risk o f isolated incidents, involving&#13;
        either local populations or armed groups.&#13;
&#13;
        The Government and other relevant authorities have agreed to provide guarantees&#13;
        for the safety o f workers and equipment, andto take appropriate measures to that&#13;
        effect. Incase o f security incidents, the Bank or the Governrnent could decideto&#13;
        suspend executionof, or cancel part or the whole of specific contracts (with&#13;
        adequate compensation to the relevant contractors). It should be noted that the&#13;
        activities financed under the Project are expected to also contribute to mitigating&#13;
        this riskbyproviding employment opportunities invery poor areasand&#13;
        demonstrating the benefits o f peace.&#13;
&#13;
        (iii)Therisksresultingfromthecurrentlackof administrativecapacityin&#13;
       particular at the local level. Despite its impressive track record o f economic&#13;
        reforms over the last two years, the Government still has a relatively weak&#13;
        institutional and administrative capacity, which could lead to delays during&#13;
        implementation. The situation is worse at the provincial and local levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 56   -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  To reduce demands on institutional capacity, and minimize these risks,&#13;
  implementationwill largely rest on ad hoc arrangementsbased on service&#13;
  contracts with independent entities. The Project also includes a provision for the&#13;
  employment o f qualified engineers to be seconded at local level under component&#13;
  A. Additional needs for technical support, ifany, will be identifiedby regular&#13;
  implementationsupport missions.&#13;
&#13;
  (iv) Therisks resultingfrom the absence of afunctioning marketfor many goods&#13;
  and services in some isolated areas. Access to many areas, includinglarge cities&#13;
  remains difficult, while a small number o f suppliersseem to enjoy semi-&#13;
  monopolistic positions. This translates into a steep rise o f prices for both goods&#13;
  and works. Inaddition, inmany areas, most contractors have lost equipment and&#13;
  staff, and have not been active for several years. This may substantially reduce&#13;
  the number o f potential contractors insome areas, and result ininadequate&#13;
  competition and highprices. This risk i s particularly relevant for the&#13;
  implementation of components A, Byand D.&#13;
&#13;
  Wherever possible and appropriate (inparticular under components A, Byand D),&#13;
  the Project will encourage the breakingdown of activities into multiple small&#13;
  contracts, to maximize the number o f potential contractors and through repeated&#13;
  biddingprocess facilitate the emergence o f a market price. The Project will also&#13;
  allow for low thresholds for open competitive procedures to limit the impact of&#13;
  local monopolies. Ifprices in some areas were substantially higherthan those&#13;
  usually charged inthe region, the Bank could decide not to finance the&#13;
  corresponding contracts and to reallocate the resources to other activities.&#13;
&#13;
a Project-level risks. These include:&#13;
&#13;
  (i)Fiduciary risks. Fiduciary risks are significant, although experience with&#13;
  earlier projects indicates that the Government i s committed to ensuring a proper&#13;
  use of funds.&#13;
&#13;
  The use of experienced entities for financial management and procurement,&#13;
  respectively UCOP and BCECO (which are regularly audited, with unqualified&#13;
  audits) are expected to reduce transparency risks. Information campaigns will&#13;
  also be organized, inparticular for components A, B, and D, to facilitate the&#13;
  involvement of communities inthe monitoring o f activities andbeneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
  (ii) risks. Intheabsenceofawell-establishedmarketforthecontractingof&#13;
      Price&#13;
  many o f the activities to be financed under the Project, costs have beenestimated&#13;
  on the basis o f experience inother parts o f the country -but could require&#13;
  adjustments.&#13;
&#13;
  While contingencies under the Project remains small, all estimates usedinthis&#13;
  document are based on conservative calculations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       - 57 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        (iii) inimplementation. Whilesomedelaysinimplementationcanbe&#13;
              Delays&#13;
        expected andmanaged, significant delays would alter the nature o fthe Project and&#13;
        potentiallyjeopardize its impact.&#13;
&#13;
        The Bankwill provide hands-on support throughout the duration o f&#13;
        implementation to help keep a rapid pace o f execution and minimize potential&#13;
        delays.&#13;
&#13;
        (iv) Sustainability. Sustainabilityofthe activities to be financed under the Project&#13;
        i s critical to ensure the desiredimpact. Experience shows, however, that the&#13;
        availability o f dedicated resources fort operation and maintenance i s often key to&#13;
        such sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
        The Project i s expected to provide some funding for maintenance and operation o f&#13;
        rehabilitated facilities duringthe lifetime o f the Project. Particular attentionwill&#13;
        be paidduring implementationto puttinginplace adequate systems for&#13;
        mobilizing the necessary resources, and optimizing their use for maintenance and&#13;
        operation. Medium-termsustainability, however, will only be possible withinthe&#13;
        context o f a pacified country and a growing economy.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                        EXITSTRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
142.    The proposed contingency response to a possible deterioration ofthe political and&#13;
security situation consists inan incrementaland targeted scaling down. Experience&#13;
shows, however, that while the security o f staff and contractors needs to be preserved,&#13;
suspendingoperations over a longperiod oftime and canceling contracts makes it&#13;
difficult to provide the type o f rapid support which i s needed whenthe situation&#13;
improves. While the resumption o f a full-scale, and lengthy war could leadthe Bank to&#13;
consider withdrawing from some parts or the whole o f DRC, the primaryresponse to a&#13;
deterioration o f the security or political situation will consist inscaling down activities,&#13;
rather than suspendingthem.&#13;
&#13;
143.    The Bank will work inclose coordination with UNagencies andkey bilateralsto&#13;
monitor political and security developments, so as to rapidlyrespondto unfolding events.&#13;
The response will bebased on a dual assessment-o f staff security ando fthe probability&#13;
for specific activities to be successfully implemented. Practical steps will include&#13;
revision o f implementation schedule, revision of the scope o f interventions, and possibly&#13;
partial suspension o f activities.&#13;

&#13;
General&#13;
&#13;
144.    Procurement will be carried out inaccordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004,&#13;
andthe provisions stipulatedinthe DevelopmentGrant Agreement. The general&#13;
description o f various itemsunder different expenditure category i s detailed below. For&#13;
each contract to be financed by the Grant, the procurement method (or consultant selection&#13;
method), the need for prequalification, the estimated costs, the prior review requirements&#13;
(ifany), andthe corresponding timetablewere agreedbetweenthe Borrower andtheBank&#13;
duringnegotiations and are reflected inthe Procurement Plan. The ProcurementPlanwill&#13;
be updatedat least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual Project implementation&#13;
needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
145.    A Country ProcurementAssessment Review(CPAR) was preparedby the&#13;
Government with World Bank support andwas presentedat a workshop heldinMay&#13;
2004. This assessment identifiedmajor flaws inthe country's procurement rules and&#13;
systems -with outdated procedures and compromisedadministrative capacity. While&#13;
remedial measures are being designed and implemented (with Bank support under the&#13;
EESRSP), national procedures cannot be used for the purposes o f implementing Bank-&#13;
financed projects.&#13;
&#13;
146.    Overall, procurement arrangements for the Project build on experience to date&#13;
with earlier Bank-financedprojects (inparticular the EESRSP). This includes&#13;
procurement methods and ceilings, which are identical or similar (as may be relevant) to&#13;
those successfully used under the EESRSP.&#13;
&#13;
147.    Procurementof Works:Works procuredunder the Project will include:&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement o f existing roads, water supply systems, power facilities,&#13;
social infrastructure (e.g., primary schools, health centers) and economic infrastructure&#13;
(e.g., markets). The procurement will be done usingthe Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents (SBD) for all ICB andNational SBD agreed with the Bank. Works estimated&#13;
to cost less thanUS$l,000,000 equivalent per contract may be procured on the basis o f&#13;
NCB.&#13;
&#13;
148.    Procurementof Goods: Goods procuredunder the Project will include: (i)        office&#13;
equipment, hardware and software, (ii)      vehicles, (iii)hrniture and other specialized&#13;
equipment for the rehabilitation o f social and economic infrastructure. The procurement&#13;
will be done using Bank's SBD for all ICB and National SBD agreed with the Bank.&#13;
Equipment, such as computers and vehicles to cost less than US$200,000 per contract&#13;
may be procured from the United Nations Agencies (IAPSO), in accordance with the&#13;
Bank Guidelines. Goods estimated to cost less than US$250,000 equivalent per contract&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            - 63 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
may be procured on the basis o f NCB. Goods estimated to cost less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent per contract may be procured on the basis o f shopping procedures.&#13;
&#13;
149.    Selectionof Consultants:Consulting services financed underthe Project will&#13;
include studies, technical assistance, supervision services, management services, and&#13;
training services. Short lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in&#13;
accordance with the provisions o fparagraph 2.7 o fthe Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
150.    OperationalCosts:Operational costs financedunder the Project will beprocured&#13;
usingUCOP administrative procedures, which were reviewed and found acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
151.    Others:Force Account Services will be financed by the Project to help&#13;
Government-owned unit like the ``Office des Routes" and BCECO implement the Project.&#13;
Standard service contract or financing agreements ("conventions") are already inuse and&#13;
implemented successfully under the EESRSP and the same documentation will be use&#13;
under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement&#13;
&#13;
152.    Procurement activities will be carried out by (i)  BCECO using BCECO&#13;
procurement manual, and (ii)    an Urban Rehabilitation Management Firm(URMF) for&#13;
activities under component B and D usingUCOP Operation Manual (to be detailed inthe&#13;
URMFOperation Manualonce the firmis designated). The table below shows the entity&#13;
incharge o fprocurement for each component.&#13;

&#13;
153.    UCOP will delegate procurement responsibility as described above, andwill not&#13;
be directly involved inprocurement. Overall, for components A, B, C, and D, UCOP is&#13;
expected to sign and BCECO to procure a total o f seven contracts as follows: (i)     one&#13;
service contract with the URMFto manage the implementation o f components B and D,&#13;
(ii) contracts(threecontractsofworksandtwocontracts'ofsupervision)under&#13;
    five&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
153.    UCOP will also enter into two service agreements with BCECO: (i)       for BCECO&#13;
as a procurement agent for the six above-mentioned contracts; and (ii)   for BCECO as&#13;
implementing agency for component A o fthe Project. BCECO and the URMFare&#13;
expected to sign contracts for works, goods and services duringthe implementation o fthe&#13;
components they will be responsible for.&#13;
&#13;
154.    BCECO's procurement capacity i s known and deemed satisfactory. BCECO has&#13;
capable and experienced staff, who has satisfactorily carried out substantial procurement&#13;
activities over the last three years inaccordance with Bank guidelines (particularly for the&#13;
EERP, EMRRP,and EESRSP). Recent procurement capacity assessments confirm the&#13;
adequacy o f procurement capacity inBCECO. Financingwill be available under the&#13;
Project to hire additional staff as may be needed for procurement under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
155.    The URMF's procurement capacity will be assessedat the selection process stage.&#13;
The procedure will be identical to the one already implementedunder the EESRSP. The&#13;
firmwill be recruited soon after effectiveness onthe basis ofterms ofreference and&#13;
qualification criteria, which emphasize requirementsfor procurement, and have been&#13;
reviewed by Bank procurement specialists. A procurement capacity assessment o fthe&#13;
URMFwill be carriedout after its recruitment, to ensure ithas adequate capacity to&#13;
procure all contracts to be financed under components B and D.&#13;
&#13;
156.    Procurement issues and risks for implementationo f the Project which have been&#13;
identifiedinclude: (i) inthe selection o f contractors and suppliers; (ii)&#13;
                         delays&#13;
cumbersome procedure relatedto the setup o fthe bid evaluation committees; and (iii)&#13;
limited competitive process due to the fragile economical environment which does not&#13;
attract enough competitors yet for large contracts (US$ 10 to 30 millions). The corrective&#13;
measures, which have been agreed, are: (i)    designationo f a focal point at BCECO and a&#13;
focal point at UCOP to monitor the execution o f the procurement plan; (ii)    agreement on&#13;
the compositionofthe bidevaluation committee at BCECO and clear rules included in&#13;
the TORSo f the URMF; and (iii)    packaging o f the road rehabilitation works into medium-&#13;
size contracts to facilitate prer-qualification andhence increase competition. The overall&#13;
Project risk for procurement remains high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
157.    The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan, which has been agreed&#13;
between the Borrower and the Project Team on April 26,2005 and i s available at UCOP.&#13;
Itwill also be available inthe Project's databaseand inthe Bank's external website. The&#13;
Procurement Planwill be updated inagreement with the Project Team annually or as&#13;
requiredto reflect the actual Project implementation needs and improvements in&#13;
institutional capacity.&#13;

&#13;
      158.    Inaddition to the prior review supervision to becarried out from Bank offices, the&#13;
      capacity assessment o f BCECO has recommended two supervision missions to visit the&#13;
      field to carry out post review o f procurement actions.&#13;

Background&#13;
&#13;
Country background&#13;
&#13;
159.    The DRC has experienced a longperiod of instability, duringwhich the&#13;
administrative and governance institutions inthe country were significantly weakened.&#13;
While tremendous efforts have been undertakento re-establish functioning institutions,&#13;
the existingfinancial management capacity remains weak inmost entities -as&#13;
highlightedina recentjoint IMF/World Bank assessmento fthe DRC's eligibility for&#13;
assistance under HIPC.&#13;
&#13;
160.    In-depthstructuralreforms have been launched inthe areas of economic&#13;
governance, public expenditure management, transparency, financial sector, and public&#13;
enterprises reform. The country's development partners have also expressed their interest&#13;
inhelpingto strengthen capacity inpublic administration. Although there is causefor&#13;
cautious optimism, it will take a long time for these reforms to yield the necessary&#13;
improvements inthe management o fpublic funds.&#13;
&#13;
Project's objectives, description, and costs&#13;
&#13;
161.    The Project aims to assist the Government inimproving living conditions by&#13;
consolidating the social and economic situation inkey urbancenters and intwo isolated&#13;
regions. The total cost o f the Project i s estimated at US$ 82 million, including US$3&#13;
million for project management andUS$3 millionincontingencies. The Project includes&#13;
four components as follows:&#13;
    0   Component A: Support to medium urbancenters (US$lO million).&#13;
    0   Component B: Support to provincial capitals (US$27 million);&#13;
    0   Component C: Connectivity to isolated areas (US$32 million);&#13;
    0   Component D: Support to provincial institutions (US$7 million).&#13;
&#13;
Institutional and implementation arrangements&#13;
&#13;
162.    The Project's implementation arrangements will be based on a delegation o f&#13;
implementation responsibilities to technical entities and private consulting firms&#13;
wherever possible. Overall implementation will use the same arrangements as the&#13;
EESRSP currently managed by UCOP:&#13;
&#13;
    0   The Interministerial Oversight Committee (Comite` Interministhiel de&#13;
        Supervision, CIS). The CIS will overview UCOP activities, with a focus on&#13;
        effectiveness and transparency, provide overall guidance as may be needed, and&#13;
        facilitate the coordination o f the various public institutions involved inthe&#13;
        Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 68 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         TheProject Coordination Unit (Unite`de Coordination du Projet, UCOP). UCOP&#13;
         will be the Bank's main counterpart and focal point. Itwill manage the funds o f&#13;
         the Project and will be responsible for: (i)overall oversight o f implementation;&#13;
         (ii)implementation o f specific activities as described below; (iii)coordination&#13;
        with technical ministries and other relevant entities for the successful&#13;
         implementation o f all components; and (iv) liaison with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
         TheBureau Central de Coordination (BCECO). BCECO will act as a&#13;
        procurement agent for all contracts to be awarded directly by the Government&#13;
        underthe Project- inadditionto its specific responsibilities for implementation&#13;
        of component A. To facilitate day to day coordination for procurement&#13;
        management, specific tasks and responsibilities agreed betweenUCOP and&#13;
        BCECO are reflected ina contractual agreement between the two institutions,&#13;
        which i s acceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
Overall conclusion of thefinancial management assessment of UCOP&#13;
&#13;
163.    UCOP will be responsible for financial management o f Project resources. UCOP&#13;
was established inSeptember 2003 to manage the funds under the IDA-financed&#13;
EESRSP.&#13;
&#13;
164.    The overall conclusion from the assessmentdoes satisfy the World Bank's&#13;
minimumfinancial management requirements. Overall, performance to date has been&#13;
satisfactory. A SOE Review was carried out inJune 2004 and an action planwas put in&#13;
place to remedy observed weaknesses ininternal controls. This action plan i s being&#13;
implemented with significant success. The format o f the Financial MonitoringReports&#13;
(FMR)has been revised anddelays insubmittingthese documents shortened.&#13;
&#13;
165,    Implementation o f the Project will translate into an increase o f activity for UCOP&#13;
-whichinturnwillrequiremoresophisticatedcontrolsystemsandadequatestaff, an&#13;
effective internal audit function, upgrading the manual o f procedures, an integrated&#13;
information system (network system) and a multi-projects software.&#13;
&#13;
Summary risk analysis&#13;
&#13;
166.    The objectives o fthe Project's fiduciary management systemwill be: (i) ensure&#13;
                                                                                     to&#13;
that Project funds are used only for their intendedpurposes inan efficient and economical&#13;
way; (ii) to enable the rapid disbursement o f Project funds to beneficiaries; (iii) to&#13;
ascertain that funds are properly managed and flow smoothly, adequately, regularly and&#13;
predictably; (iv) to enable the preparation o f accurate andtimely fiduciary reports; (v) to&#13;
assist buildthe capacity o fthe beneficiaries interms o f fiduciary management; (vi) to&#13;
stimulate accountability through a strong flow o f information on Project activities; (vii) to&#13;

     0  Ability ofUCOPto handleincreasedworkload associatedwith implementation of&#13;
        the Project;&#13;
     0  Quality of the collaboration betweenBCECO andUCOP on procurement -&#13;
        particularly incase an audit would raiseprocurement-related issues (e.g.,&#13;
        ineligible expenditures dueto no compliance with Bank procurement procedures).&#13;
&#13;

Overall responsibilities&#13;
&#13;
169.    The overall coordination ofthe fiduciary aspects o fthe Project will be under the&#13;
responsibility o f UCOP. All funds will be managedby UCOP.&#13;
&#13;
170.    Within UCOP, the Financial Departmentwill beresponsible for all aspects of&#13;
financial management, accounting, and audit for the Project. Inparticular, it will be&#13;

internal control systemis inplace to achieve accountability at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
Financial, accounting, and administrativeprocedures manual&#13;
&#13;
171.    UCOP has an administrative, financial and accounting manual o f procedures&#13;
already approved by IDA. Itdescribes specific procedures for each significant&#13;
accounting function and covers the following aspects: flow of funds; recordkeeping and&#13;
maintenance, the chart of accounts, formats of records andbooks of account;&#13;
authorization procedures for transactions; planningand budgeting; financial reports&#13;
(including formats, linkages with Chart of Accounts andprocedures for reviewingthese),&#13;
and auditing arrangements. The Manual will be subject to minor adjustments to reflect&#13;
the specific elements ofthe Project. This will be usedby: staff as a reference manual,&#13;
IDAto assess the acceptability ofthe project accounting, reporting and control systems,&#13;
andby the auditors to assess project accounting systems and controls and indesigning&#13;
specific project audit procedures.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
172.    UCOP will prepare a budgeton an annual basis, which will be underpinnedby a&#13;
work plan(plannedactivities, responsibilities, andrelated costs), and will form the basis&#13;
for cash requests. The work planwill include a consolidation (by UCOP) o f each&#13;
implementing agency's work plan. Itwill be submittedto the CIS for approval.&#13;
&#13;
173,    An overall Project budgetand a disbursement schedule have beenprepared and&#13;
reviewedby IDA, and will constitute the basis for annual budgets.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing&#13;
&#13;
174.    UCOP will retain adequate staffing resources for proper financial management.&#13;
Training and capacity buildingplans will be designed, as may be needed, for current and&#13;
new staff to be recruited.&#13;
&#13;
Record keeping and maintenance&#13;
&#13;
175.    UCOP will be responsible for maintaining the Project's records. Accounting&#13;
source documents of Executing Agencies such as BCECO and URMF will be kept at&#13;
their premises and made available for verification uponrequest.&#13;
&#13;
Financiaf reporting&#13;
&#13;
176.    Financial reports will be designed to provide quality andtimely information to&#13;
Project management, agencies, and various stakeholders on project performance. At least&#13;
two sets o f financial reports will be prepared by the Financial Department o f UCOP, the&#13;
quarterly Financial MonitoringReports (FMRs) andthe Project financial statements&#13;
(additional ad hoc reports may be requested by IDA):&#13;
&#13;
    0   The format and content o f the FMR currently provided by UCOP will be used for&#13;
        this Project with minor changes to take into account the specificity ofthe Project.&#13;
        The FMRinclude financial statements (e.g. sources and uses o f funds;&#13;
        expenditure classified by project components, disbursement categories,&#13;
        expenditure types and agencies, and comparisons with budgets, cash forecast,&#13;
        physical progress report, notes to the FMR). Additional information required by&#13;
        IDA for disbursement purposes will also be included such as a Special Account&#13;
        activity statement and information on contracts above and below the prior review&#13;
        threshold.&#13;
&#13;
    0   The annual financial statements will include: (i)balance sheet (with assets and&#13;

I ntegratedfinancia1management system&#13;
&#13;
177.    UCOP has acquired and installed a multiprojects accounting software&#13;
(TOMPRO) for the integrated financial management o fthe EESRP. The same software&#13;
will be used for this project subject to minor configurations.&#13;
&#13;
Audits&#13;
&#13;
178.    Internal audit. An internal audit function will be established to ensure that the&#13;
fiduciary procedures and regulations relatingto the management o f Project resources are&#13;
adheredto, as part o f UCOP's overall control mechanism. This function will be&#13;
outsourced to a reputable audit firm. This firm will inspect accounting procedures used&#13;
by UCOP and other executing agencies to ensure that they conform to the established&#13;
procedures and guidelines (and may also verify expenditures). The manual o f accounting&#13;
procedures contains a description o fthe roles and responsibilities o fthe internal auditor,&#13;
and a description o f a line or reporting that guaranteesthe requisite level of&#13;
independence.&#13;
&#13;
179.    Externalfinancial audit. A firm o f qualified independent auditors will be&#13;
contracted by UCOP, on the basis o f Terms o f Reference acceptable to IDA, to audit the&#13;
Project's financial statements on an annual basis. The audit will cover the activities&#13;
performed by all entities managing Project funds. The audited financial statements&#13;
together with the auditor's report and management letter covering identified internal&#13;
control and accounting system weaknesses will be submitted to IDA within six months&#13;
after the end o f each year. A single audit opinion will be issued on project income and&#13;
expenditures, special accounts and FMRs. Another audit opinion will be issuedon&#13;
specific controls such as compliance with procurement procedures andFMR&#13;
requirements and consistency betweenfinancial statement andthe management report.&#13;
&#13;
180.    Closing the accountability cycle:following up on audit queries. The CIS will&#13;
review audited financial statements and internal and external audit findings, and i s&#13;
mandated to require UCOP to take corrective action as may be needed. UCOP will also&#13;
use the audits inmonitoring the performance o fthe executing agencies, to ensure a&#13;
satisfactory follow-up o f audit findings.&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
181.     The outsourcing o fthe internal auditing functions to an auditing firmwill enable&#13;
the establishment o f a fiduciary management system for the Project that satisfies the&#13;
Bank's minimumrequirements under OP/BP 8.50 and i s adequate to provide, with&#13;
reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status o f the Project&#13;
requiredby IDA.The actions that are requiredto facilitate the establishment ofthis&#13;
system are set out inthe Financial Management Action Plan below.&#13;

            Congo, Democratic Republic of - Emergency
            Living Conditions Improvement Support Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the current
            Transitional Support Strategy for the Democratic Republic of
            the Congo (DCR) is to support the recovery and transition
            process, that is to help consolidate the peace and
            reconciliation process and to restore the foundations on
            which effective poverty alleviation efforts can be
            successfully undertaken. It includes four strategic
            elements: (i) security and social stability, which includes
            consolidating social stability in volatile areas, especially
            in urban centers, and re-establishing the authority of the
            State throughout the country; (ii) high and shared growth,
            which requires a particular effort to rehabilitate transport
            infrastructure (since the collapse of the transport system
            is the single most stringent constraint to economic recovery
            in large parts of the country) and urban infrastructure (for
            urban centers to effectively regain their central role as
            market places and pools of capacities); (iii) governance and
            institutional strengthening, in particular at the provincial
            level; and (iv) social development, in particular to improve
            living conditions in urban areas, where a third of
            DRC's population lives and where quick-wins can be most
            easily achieved.
