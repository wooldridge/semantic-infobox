PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA&#13;
URBAN NATURAL HAZARD VULNERABILITY REDUCTION PROJECT&#13;
1 INTRODUCTION&#13;
On November 10 and 11, 2001, Algeria was hit by flooding of unprecedented proportions&#13;
particularly the region of Algiers. Most devastated were a dozen municipalities located largely in&#13;
Bab El Oued. More than 800 people were killed in the region of Algiers alone; property damage&#13;
is estimated at $US400 million (minimum). The Wilaya of Algiers took immediate emergency&#13;
measures, with support from various administrations, public agencies, and the population that&#13;
brought temporary relief to the affected population and somewhat mitigated the immediate impact&#13;
of the flooding. However, the flooding highlighted the vulnerability of urban areas to natural&#13;
disasters, and the need to reduce this vulnerability by introducing medium and long-term disaster&#13;
mitigation measures, both at the national level and at the local level, particularly in Algiers.&#13;
2 PROJECT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS&#13;
This project will have two main objectives:&#13;
a)     To improve the ability of Algerian institutions at the national level to cope with&#13;
natural disasters by developing their monitoring capacity, the early warning&#13;
system, their understanding of the meteorological phenomena that led to the&#13;
November 10, 2001 floods, by improving the means of intervention by social&#13;
protection organization, and by developing detailed plans to reduce the&#13;
vulnerability of urban zones in the Wilaya of Algiers; and&#13;
b)     To address specifically the vulnerability of the urban zones most seriously&#13;
affected by the flooding of November 10, 2001. The objective of this project is&#13;
particularly to reduce the risks incurred by the population of these zones, some&#13;
30,000 people, and to provide indirect protection to more than 250,000 people&#13;
living in downstream districts, sites of ancient urbanization. . The measures to be&#13;
developed will contribute to resolving the currently serious problems of pollution&#13;
and erosion. This accords with one of the objectives of the Algerian Government,&#13;
to improve in a sustainable manner the conditions of life of the population&#13;
affected by the disaster and of those located downstream that could face similar&#13;
risks.&#13;
As a result, the project will have two key components, each of them directly linked to the&#13;
above-mentioned objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

SECTION 2&#13;
COMPONENT 1: DISASTER MANAGEMENT CAPACITY BUILDING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.     COMPONENT 1: capacity Building AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL&#13;
The objectives of this component are two-fold: (a) to reinforce national capacity to face&#13;
unavoidable natural disasters, and minimize their consequences; and (b) to improve the ability to&#13;
anticipate disasters by setting up a monitoring and early warning system. The lessons learned&#13;
from the accumulated experience in disaster management in Algeria (i.e. Mascara and Ain-&#13;
Temouchent) and the ongoing activities under the Bank-financed Ain-Temouchent Project were&#13;
taken into account in designing this component which includes the following studies and&#13;
activities for institutional strengthening:&#13;
2.1  STUDIIES AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
a)     Preparatory study, design and implementation of an integrated monitoring and early&#13;
warning system for meteorological risks in the Wilaya of Algiers, with a view to expanding it&#13;
nationwide. The terms of reference of the survey have been defined. The terms of reference target&#13;
institutional, organizational and technical measures for the National Meteorological Office&#13;
(ONM) to improve monitoring, warning and information.&#13;
b)     Scientific study to understand the natural phenomenon causing the November 2001 floods&#13;
toward increasing forecasting capacity. This study aims at informing the authorities and the&#13;
scientific community on the real reasons behind the disaster to improve disaster-forecasting&#13;
capacities;&#13;
c)     Study of vulnerable sites in the Wilaya of Algiers (excluding the Bouzareah massif). The&#13;
purpose of this study is to identify, appraise and outline solutions to risks threatening zones in&#13;
Algiers. (Bouzareah, another vulnerable area, is the subject of a specific study). Risks to be&#13;
addressed in the study relate to flooding, crumbling, landslides, seismic tremors and pollution.&#13;
The study will outline solutions to reduce these risks, to limit their impacts, and to facilitate the&#13;
rescue of victims of natural disasters. The zones that would be covered by this survey tentatively&#13;
include the following: Hamiz Oued located in East Algiers; Oued El Harrach; Ouchaiah Oued;&#13;
Kniss Oued and the Telemly landslide-prone zone located in downtown Algiers. These zones are&#13;
known to be high-risk, however the preliminary phase of the study will determine the priority&#13;
zones with the highest level of risk.&#13;
d)     Global integrated study to reduce vulnerability and address the catchments basins in the&#13;
Bouzareah massif. The objective of this study is to identify and evaluate possible mitigation&#13;
measures for risk reduction in Algiers outside the Bouzareah Massif watershed (the subject area&#13;
of the scientific study above).&#13;
This project sub-component will be carried out in two stages ending with a detailed&#13;
action plan to render the concerned zone less vulnerable.&#13;
2.2  TRAINING&#13;
Training activities target the National Directorate of the Civil Protection (DGPC), the&#13;
National Agency of Water Resources (ANRH) and the National Meteorology Office (ONM).&#13;
The Algerian authorities are seeking sources of financing (grants or confessional loans) that could&#13;
eventually complete, or even to partly replace the World Bank financing if the need arises. They&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
have therefore asked the Bank to help identify other sources of financing for this training. The&#13;
following institutions will benefit from the training:&#13;
a) DGPC. Specialized training envisaged in disaster management Will essentially apply to&#13;
training of trainers at the National School for Civil Protection. This training will be provided by&#13;
Algerian institutions, Which will seek support from international experts. If need be, short-term&#13;
training sessions will be organized abroad in specialized institutions.&#13;
b) ANRH. This training is for capacity building in production of documents necessary for flood&#13;
modeling and simulation (land numeric models, ortho-photographs, flood area maps, micro-&#13;
zoning etc.) using aerial and satellite imagery. It essentially requires advanced specializations for&#13;
engineering school graduates that can be undertaken in a short period of time (less than 4 weeks)&#13;
using Geographical Information System software (GIS) and software for medium and high&#13;
resolution aerial and satellite imagery. Algerian institutions will provide this training with the&#13;
assistance of international experts.&#13;
c) ONM. The strengthening of capacities relates, first and foremost, to personnel involved in&#13;
numeric weather forecasting and its application to extreme meteorological conditions; The&#13;
interpretation of meteorological phenomena and satellite imagery and its practical application are&#13;
relatively complex technologies. ONM staff needs to upgrade their skills in fine-grid modeling,&#13;
through specialized training in interpretation of different data types and modeling and&#13;
simulations.&#13;
2.3 EQUIPMENT&#13;
The equipment necessary to strengthen the institutions involved will be procured under&#13;
the project.&#13;
a)     ONM. Equipment is needed to enhance ONM     weather-forecasting abilities.  The&#13;
replacement of the Algiers radar by a long-range Doppler radar will permit a refinement of the&#13;
grids (that will be brought back to 5 km). The network of automatic stations covering the Algiers&#13;
region, under the authorities of the Wilaya of Algiers, will constitute an urban network of&#13;
meteorological observation posts that will permit better tracking of meteorological phenomena in&#13;
progress, and monitor their intensity.&#13;
The integration of radar and satellite data will provide finer grids capable of generating&#13;
finer-scaled weather numeric forecasting and will require a more powerful. The necessary&#13;
software can be acquired gratis within the framework of donor cooperation.&#13;
b)     DGPC. Equipment to support the DGPC was identified from the experience of managing&#13;
the aftermath of the November 2001 flooding.&#13;
i)     Water and mud evacuation equipment: muddy water in buildings could not be&#13;
drained through existing means.&#13;
ii)    Excavation equipment: The available equipment was useless to open up access&#13;
for first-aid workers and for removal of debris in narrow alley networks. The project will&#13;
therefore provide small caterpillars specifically for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
iii)   Lighting equipment and on-site energy production: indispensable materials&#13;
for night operations, for the connection and the use of equipment. The DGSN lighting&#13;
vehicle was the only one that enabled night rescue operations following the events of&#13;
November 9-10, 2001.&#13;
iv)    Aquatic rescue equipment: to recover vehicles and passengers that have been&#13;
swept away or trapped by floodwaters.&#13;
v)     Emergency rescue equipment and emergency medicine: to enable onsite first&#13;
aid to the severely wounded where evacuation is hampered by disrupted or difficult&#13;
access.&#13;
vi)    Strengthening information technology: The National Directorate of Civil&#13;
Protection has set up a Geographical Information System unit (GIS) whose activity will&#13;
be geared to risk prevention and to planning rescues for both natural and industrial&#13;
disasters, to be strengthened by complementary software and data. At the beginning, this&#13;
unit will concentrate on mastering the modem tools of geographical data processing, an&#13;
essential component of Information Technologies.&#13;
c)     Computer software to strengthen ANRH: ANRH is responsible for assessment and&#13;
monitoring of water resources and must produce key information from the Integrated Monitoring&#13;
and Early Warning system. This information will be produced in different forms: production of&#13;
Land Numeric Models (DTM), Ortho-photographs and designs reproduced at higher scales for&#13;
risk zones by means of aerial and satellite imagery. They will model and simulate scenarios for&#13;
different levels of rainfall. ANRH already has the computer hardware, and the project will&#13;
provide the necessary software.&#13;
&#13;

SECTION 3&#13;
2OMPONENT 2: EMERGENCY PHYSICAL WORKS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3    COMPONENT 2: EMERGENCY PHYSICAL WORKS&#13;
The zone of intervention comprises 12 communes', mostly in the jurisdiction of Bab El&#13;
Oued. This area was the site of the most devastation in terms of deaths as well as the volume of&#13;
physical and material destruction, including basic infrastructure such as roads, water purification&#13;
and distribution networks, socio-cultural facilities such as schools, health centers, training centers&#13;
and sport facilities and cultural heritage sites. The purpose of this component is to undertake&#13;
urgent physical works to restore these services and facilities.&#13;
3.1 HYDRAULIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION IN THE BASIN SIDE OF OUED KORICHE&#13;
The construction of flood retention basins at the interception points of various streams&#13;
connecting in Oued Koriche is planned to reduce the water levels. Their size will be dependent&#13;
on the land available, site topography, the nature of the soil and the quantity of water flowing&#13;
through of each Oued [wadi]. The precise sites, the number, measurements, and other features of&#13;
these basins will be determined by the computer simulation planned during the first phase of the&#13;
"Global Integrated Study for the Reduction of the Vulnerability and Treatment of the Basin Side&#13;
of the Bouzareah massif." At first, it is estimated that the project will cover the construction of&#13;
10 basins with a flood retention capacity of about 10,000 m3 (in Baranes, Sidi Medjbar, Frais&#13;
Vallon, Beau Fraisier, Scat and Oued Koriche) and a new water collector on the basin of the Frais&#13;
Vallon. The project will also build a channel in the sub-basin of Beau Fraisier Oued and&#13;
recalibrate the downstream section of Beau Fraisier Oued in order to improve the conditions of&#13;
water out-flow in the sub-basin side. The measurements of these channels will also be determined&#13;
by the above-referenced study.&#13;
3.2    REMEDIAL RAINFLOW MEASURES FOR THE OUEDS OF THE MASSIF OF&#13;
BOUZAREAH&#13;
To limit the water flow in the Bouzareah massif, it is necessary to make some corrective&#13;
adjustments to the rivers (Oued Deux Moulins, Oued of the Zouaves, Oued Ravine Staura, Oued&#13;
Sidi El Keibir, Oued Le Plateau,. Oued Beau-Sejours, Oued Baranes and Oued La Vigie, and&#13;
others). The proposed works in this project aim at adjusting the slope of the Oueds to reduce the&#13;
speed of water discharge and the quantities of mud carried. The works consist of constructing&#13;
earthworks and drains in selected sections of the Oueds and banks threatened with crumbling.&#13;
The works will also clean the riverbeds of debris and restore their contours.&#13;
3.3 TREE PLANTING IN THE OUED KORICHE BASIN AND ITS CHANNELS&#13;
In order to slow down outflow, encourage soil flood retention and to protect against&#13;
erosion, the Project plans to continue planting of forests on public lands and fruit trees on private&#13;
lands. This planting will be concentrated on the basin of the Oued Koriche, and will cover an area&#13;
of about 600 ha (Planting of forest trees over 360 ha and planting of fruit trees on 240 ha).&#13;
X These include the following: Bab El Oued, Oued Koriche, Bologhine, Rais Hamidou, Hammamet, Ain&#13;
Benian, Bouzareah, El Biar, Sidi M'Hamed, Alger Centre, El Madania, El Mouradia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
3.4 HOUSING&#13;
The objective of this subcomponent is to finance the cost of housing, infrastructure, and&#13;
services for 5,000 units of "social rental housing" in Algiers. Its main purpose is to rehoused&#13;
since these people: (a) have been affected by the November 10, 2001 flood; or (b) live on&#13;
vulnerable sites inside or close to the Bouzareah Massif, thus exposed to risks. Five thousand&#13;
eligible families were identified by the Algerian authorities in accordance with governmental&#13;
Decree on distribution of public housing Ministerial Decree 98-42). The more than 1,500 families&#13;
re-housed by the Algerian authorities just after the disaster, in available public housing, are&#13;
outside the scope of the present project. [The criteria of eligibility for the social housing progran&#13;
apply to recipients whose income is below twice the minimum wage (SNMG or the National&#13;
Guaranteed Minimum Salary, which was 16,000 DA, at the time of the assessment of this&#13;
project)].  The project will build on and support the following institutional and legislative&#13;
arrangements and procedures:&#13;
a)     Administrative, functional and technical controls. Regulations and a set of procedures&#13;
outlined in the following govern the activities of agencies implementing the project, especially for&#13;
housing construction:&#13;
b) The Ministry of Housing. This Ministry defines housing policy, determines public housing&#13;
construction programs, and provides credits to the planned operations in the State budget. The&#13;
annual appropriations bill, using the principle of final competition, covers planned social housing&#13;
financing in chapter 722 and land development in chapter 721. . Once the financing is secured,&#13;
the Ministry notifies the Wilayas of the budget appropriation decisions. Finally it releases the&#13;
credits for payment.&#13;
In addition, the Ministry plans the plot sizes, the types, and the prices of the planned housing.&#13;
Reference prices, norms of quality, and types serve as a basis for programs.&#13;
Reference prices are established after an analysis of the bid prices in every region of the country&#13;
(for examnple, the price per square meter for a social rental housing currently ranges between&#13;
16,000 in 18,000 DA in Algiers including designs and supervision). For this project, considering&#13;
family composition, the average norm chosen by the Direction of the Housing of the Wilaya of&#13;
Algiers corresponds to the F3 type (three rooms), of 60 square meters. The net construction cost&#13;
is estimated by the administration to be 16,000 DA /m2.&#13;
c)     The CTC (Construction- Technical Control Agency) - Its intervention is obligatory to&#13;
provide insurance coverage in Algeria. Recently, the CTC's statutes have evolved, changing it&#13;
from a public monopoly under the umbrella of the Ministry of Housing to an oligopoly under&#13;
private law. Through decentralization and then privatization, the CTC has evolved into a number&#13;
of companies (CTC Center, CTC South, CTC West, and CTC East) that operate as independent&#13;
research departments, which compete with each other nationwide.&#13;
d)     The EDE (Earthquake Detection Engineering Center) is a State-subsidized research&#13;
center. of experts devoted to analysis of seismic risk and the study of micro zoning. It offers&#13;
consulting services and provides its opinion on the viability of the sites to be used for apartment&#13;
construction programs as far as seismic risk, geomorphology and geo-technical conditions are&#13;
concerned (i.e., upon consulting the report of the soil survey).&#13;
e)     Procurement Boards- these committees/boards are entrusted with the responsibility of&#13;
controlling procurement undertaken by implementing agencies, under the terms of the Algerian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
regulations and in conformity with the World Bank procurement procedures. More specifically,&#13;
the following procurement controlling authorities will participate within the framework of this&#13;
project. For the Wilaya of Algiers, the jurisdiction of the procurement committees/boards&#13;
depends on the amount involved as outlined in the following:&#13;
Procurement under 4 million DA: Internal Committee;&#13;
Procurement between 4 million DA and 200 millions DA: Committee of Wilaya; and&#13;
Procurement above 200 million DA: National Procurement Commission.&#13;

f)     Contracting Authority and Project Manager. The implementing agency for&#13;
Component 2 will be the Wilaya of Algiers irrespective of the subcomponent. The Wali will&#13;
delegate implantation according to the nature of the subcomponent to the concerned sectoral&#13;
director of the Wilaya (for example Directorate of Housing, Direction of the Hydraulics, Forests&#13;
Conservancy of the Wilaya of Algiers).&#13;
g)     Project Management for the Construction of 5,000 Apartments- 5,000 apartments&#13;
will be distributed on the 6 selected sites. - The sites will be grouped into two lots by proximity to&#13;
one another. A consulting firm will be hired as project manager to supervise the entire process of&#13;
construction on the two sites. It will be in charge of (i) technical supervision and coordination&#13;
between the designs and works; (ii) preparation of bidding documents; and (iii) supervision of&#13;
implementation progress, and intervention in case of litigation. Each site will be divided into two&#13;
parcels; each parcel will comprise 300 to 400 units to be assigned to an architecture firm. Then,&#13;
the result will be 3 consulting firms, and from 25 to 35 to an architecture firm for all the sites&#13;
resulting in a total of about 30 selected Project Managers (from 30 separate biddings).&#13;
h)     The notion of a Lead Architect has been introduced in this program to ensure a better&#13;
coordination, piloting, and an operational follow-up with the different actors who intervene for&#13;
the studies and the realization of the project.&#13;
These consulting firms or Lead Architects will undertake the operations in coordination&#13;
with the consulting firms dealing with architecture, engineering and the follow-up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Thus, the accredited architect consulting firns will ensure technical, architectural,&#13;
engineering designs as well as supervision. They will be entrusted with the following tasks:&#13;
a) Detailed technical, architectural, and engineering designs in accordance with the&#13;
specifications;&#13;
b) Preparing the notices relative to bidding;&#13;
c) Assisting the Contracting Authority in the analysis of the bids;&#13;
d) Contracting and supervision of works.&#13;
Each of these parcels, covering 300 to 400 apartments, will be assigned to one consulting&#13;
firm. Twelve architecture-consulting firms, and three lead architects /architect advisor will ensure&#13;
project management. A single consulting architect may be considered for the whole operation.&#13;
As far as the works are concerned, it is expected to contract between 150 to 200 apartment&#13;
projects per enterprise except some contracts of a lesser consistency with 25 to 30 units in total.&#13;
Concerning land development, only one enterprise will be retained per site, except for the&#13;
largest sites. If necessary, there will be a recommendation of 2 or 3 enterprises per site, which&#13;
means about 8 contracts for the provision of all the sites with services.&#13;
This procedure does not exclude having recourse to a group of enterprises should there be&#13;
a risk of not finding enough enterprises capable of handling large construction sites, thus resulting&#13;
in a fruitless bidding.&#13;
This would have serious consequences on the implementation calendar. The Wilaya of&#13;
Algiers is conscious of the fact that such a number of contracts may impose a very strong&#13;
workload on its teams. The Wilaya has, therefore considered in the event the need arises, to seek&#13;
technical support to reinforce its management capacities for the apartment construction program.&#13;
The implementation according to the work plan will remain the determining factor in the decision&#13;
of the Wilaya.&#13;

4   COMPONENT 3: PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
The third component of the project will require the Algerian authorities to implement the&#13;
project. This component will deal with the financing of equipment acquisition and the technical&#13;
assistance (hiring of consultants) to support the authorities in carrying out the functions below:&#13;
4.1 STUDIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
4.1.1 Component 1&#13;
Sub-component 1&#13;
(a)    The study and the establishment of the rapid and early warning system have the&#13;
following objectives: i) developing the capacities of coordination among institutions; ii)&#13;
enhancing information and communication; iii) determining the levels of risks and vulnerabilities&#13;
of the communities and their properties; iv) establishing the action plans and the simulations of&#13;
coordinated intervention scenarios; v) reviewing their performance periodically; f) determining&#13;
the responsibilities and the initiatives of the actors; and g) elaborating post-disaster risks&#13;
management scenarios.&#13;
(b)    Two studies on vulnerability will outline solutions to situations of strong potential risks&#13;
that threaten some zones of the whole Wilaya of Algiers (treated in the first survey of&#13;
vulnerability) and the massif of Bouzareah in particular (treated in the second survey). Thus,&#13;
these two studies will define the nature of the corrective measures for Algiers or those measures&#13;
selected on a priority basis for the protection of the Bouzareah massif against the risks of floods&#13;
and seismic vibrations.&#13;
(c)    Finally, the scientific survey on the phenomenon that led to the disaster of&#13;
November 9/10 2001 aims at increasing the capacities of forecasting of the engineers of the&#13;
National Meteorology Office, which is entrusted with weather forecasting in the country. This&#13;
survey includes the treatment and the analysis of data.&#13;
Sub-Component 2&#13;
The second subcomponent deals with the different types of training: (This is&#13;
completely in compliance with the objective of the sub-component 1).&#13;
(a)    Short-term training concerning handling of equipment and software, for the mastery of&#13;
the new technologies such as those related to the interpretation of the radar information or&#13;
satellite imagery.&#13;
(b)    Training of trainers programs for the schools of the selected institutions&#13;
(implementation agencies) such as the ONM, the ANRH or the DGPC or for reinforcing their&#13;
educational programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
4.1.2 Component 2&#13;
This component of emergency works consists of the studies necessary for the&#13;
realization of works. Apart from the preliminary steps and studies, the numerous and important&#13;
studies, in terms of cost, deal with the following: geodetic surveys by surveyors, topographic&#13;
survey, soil study, and social assessments;&#13;
a)     The designs, supervision and allocation control of the 5,000 apartments units to be&#13;
built for the re-housing of the disaster victims and related infrastructures (ground and buried&#13;
networks, landscape amenities, school infrastructure and areas there). The other subcomponents&#13;
concerning predominantly hydraulic works and forestation include two main studies:&#13;
b)     The design and the supervision of 10 basins of flood storage in the basins side of the&#13;
massif of Bouzareah; and of&#13;
c)     The water pipes of Oued Beau-Fraisier.&#13;
4.1.3  Component 3&#13;
Strengthening project management capacities at the Wilaya level and at other&#13;
agencies level. This component includes training and technical support aspects notably to be&#13;
undertaken by consultants who have been identified, apart from those whose task is to increase&#13;
the capacity of evaluation and implementation of plans in the areas of the following:&#13;
(a) Environmental management (beneficiaries: inspection of the environment of the&#13;
Wilaya);&#13;
(b) Procurement; and&#13;
(c) The establishment of the financial management and reporting system, based on the same&#13;
software (purchase, installation, and training) utilized in the five previous projects financed&#13;
by the Bank.&#13;

5      INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
5.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES&#13;
Since many entities intervene during the ploject implementation, the Algerian&#13;
government plans to define the principles and the modalities according to which these&#13;
responsibilities will be clearly articulated.  In a more precise way, the four following basic&#13;
principles apply:&#13;
a)    Implementation of the different operational components of the project will be made by&#13;
the regular execution agencies in accordance with their prerogatives;&#13;
b)     Particular at.ention will be given to the rapid and diligent execution of this emergency&#13;
project. It will be ensured mainly through setting up the processes of supervision, coordination&#13;
and control; but also through the effective involvement of the high-level State staff to monitor the&#13;
project implementation;&#13;
c)     The handling and the re-housing of the families affected by the disaster and eligible to the&#13;
relocation according to the regulation in force relative to this project, constitute an aspect that&#13;
requires a particular attention. Resettlement Action Plan Framework (RAP) outlines specifically&#13;
the way in which such an aspect will be implemented. This Plan as well as the implementation&#13;
arrangements are part of the Project Implementation Mlanual and will thus be closely coordinated&#13;
with the other aspects ot' the project; and&#13;
d)     Since this project is executed with the financial support of the World Bank, the Algerian&#13;
authorities fully understand related obligations. Therefore, the Borrower agrees to implement the&#13;
project while respecting the conditions pertaining to the fiduciary obligations of the World Bank&#13;
on Procurement, Disbursement, protection of the environment, social aspects, and resettlement.&#13;
5.2    THE DIFFERENT PARTIES INVOLVED AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES&#13;
The roles will be defined as follows:&#13;
The Implementation Agencies- The primary responsibility of these agencies is to&#13;
implement different components of this project. This responsibility, which is entrusted to a&#13;
contracting authority or operation manager, implies, in particular, the exercise of the following&#13;
functions: definition of specifications and/or terms of reference, requests for consultants and/or&#13;
calls for bids, procurement, reception and control of rendered services, and organization of the&#13;
expenses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5.3    PROJECT MANAGEMENT, COORDINATION AND MONITORING&#13;
The general management of the project will be entrusted to the Ministry of the Interior&#13;
and Municipalities (MICL). This component is important because its objective is to reduce the&#13;
vulnerability of the urban zones in the Wilaya of Algiers. The Ministry will undertake the&#13;
organization of following committees:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
a)    Inter-Ministerial Committee presided over by His Excellency the Minister of Interior and&#13;
Municipalities or his representative will be entrusted with task of orienting the activities of the&#13;
project, to ensure its strategic coordination, and to conduct the required budget appropriation.&#13;
This committee will be composed of representatives of the Ministries of Finances, Housing,&#13;
Agriculture and the Forests, the Public Works, Water Resources, and Transport, as well as&#13;
representatives of the Wilaya of Algiers. This Committee will meet on regular basis and as&#13;
needed. The Technical Secretariat of this Committee operates under the Ministry of Interior and&#13;
Local Collectivities.&#13;
b)     Special Committee in charge of dealing relocation of the populations will also be&#13;
convened to treat these important activities pertaining to vulnerable people.&#13;
c)     Project Coordination Unit will be established within the Wilaya and will have the&#13;
following key missions:&#13;
i)     Helping the implementation agencies to ensure that the procurement procedures&#13;
are in compliance with those of the World Bank. The Algerian Authorities&#13;
strongly stressed the fact that this Unit would not undertake procurement&#13;
transactions and this function are entrusted to each implementation agency;&#13;
ii)    Preparing follow-up and status reports and the monitoring tables&#13;
(Performance indicators);&#13;
iii)   Consolidating the project accounting of different components;&#13;
iv)    Submitting to the Algerian Development Bank (BAD), within no more&#13;
than 5 workdays, the payment requests emanating from the implementing&#13;
agencies upon ascertaining that the support documents are in compliance&#13;
with the procedures of the World Bank; and&#13;
v)     Managing the project documents.&#13;

6      PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES&#13;
6.1 PROCUREMENT&#13;
Procurement for the proposed project will abide by Bank procedures as defined in the&#13;
published Guidelines as follows:&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (published in January&#13;
1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999), as well as the&#13;
Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of consultants by the Borrowers of the World Bank&#13;
(published in January 1997 and revised in January 1999), and arrangements contained in the loan&#13;
agreement. A list of goods to be acquired has been established, and the Procurement Plan has&#13;
been prepared and agreed to by the borrower at the time of the assessment. Other items could be&#13;
identified during implementation. In this case procurement will be in accordance with the&#13;
principles determined at the appraisal.&#13;
6.2    MODALITIES FOR PROCUREMENT REVIEWS&#13;
Considering the necessity to rapidly undertake required action at every stage of the&#13;
process, an agreement will be concluded with the Borrower as for the standard period of review&#13;
pertaining to actions such as the preparation of the bidding documents and technical&#13;
specifications, evaluation of the bids and selection in order to ensure the preparation and&#13;
clarification of the contract documents, contract award and signature, notification etc.  The&#13;
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will establish an access to the Internet as soon as possible. The&#13;
delegation of functions and the government approval procedures should be simplified and agreed&#13;
upon in order to avoid delays. The PCU will be staffed with a Procurement Specialist and he will&#13;
be provided access to the Internet network. The Borrower will have the option to rely upon the&#13;
assistance of qualified procurement consultants to seek advice and to train the staff of the&#13;
implementation agencies in charge of procurement, as well as those of the PCU.&#13;
The estimated value of civil works to be procured under ICB procedures is US$26.3&#13;
million, and would be used for civil works contracts of estimated value over US$5.0 million&#13;
equivalent each. Works contracts costing less than US$5.0 million equivalent each would be&#13;
procured using NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank and, in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
the Paragraph l(c), part C of Schedule 3 of the Legal Agreement. Small works contracts not&#13;
exceeding US$250,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate of US$1.5 million would be&#13;
procured under the Small Works procedure, based on at least three quotations (in writing),&#13;
obtained after written requests. The estimated value of goods to be procured under ICB&#13;
procedures is US$7.0 million. All goods contracts of estimated value of more than US$250,000&#13;
equivalent each would be procured using ICB procedures. NCB procedures would be used for&#13;
procurement of goods contracts costing less than US$250,000 equivalent. Goods contracts&#13;
costing less than US$100,000 equivalent would be procured using international or national&#13;
shopping procedures. Works contract estimated to cost more than US$500,000 equivalent each&#13;
and goods contracts estimated to cost more than US$100,000 equivalent each will be subject to&#13;
prior review. Consultant contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more would&#13;
be procured using Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) procedures, seeking interest through&#13;
notification in the UN Development Business. For contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent, consultants may be engaged using QCBS, Quality-Based Selection&#13;
(QBS) or Least Cost procedures in conformity with Section 3 of the Guidelines. For individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
consultant contracts estimated to cost equivalent or more than US$50,000, Section 5 of the&#13;
Guidelines will be applied and prior review will be required. "Project Costs by Procurement&#13;
Arrangements" table attached to this MOP provides information on procurement methods for&#13;
works, goods and services contracts proposed under the project.&#13;
6.3    PROCUREMENT METHODS (SEE TABLE A)&#13;
Goods&#13;
ICB- For contracts estimated to cost US$0.25 million or more simplified ICB procedures&#13;
as described below will be used.&#13;
(a)   Advertisement- As soon as possible, but at the latest time when the goods important to be&#13;
acquired are identified, a General Procurement Notice will be published for every project in&#13;
Development Business along with the required services of consultants.  This notice will be&#13;
inviting the eligible contractors, suppliers, firms and eligible interested consultants to submit their&#13;
interest to bid to the implementation agencies, which will forward a copy to the PCU. The&#13;
General Procurement Notice will also be published in the Algerian national newspapers. For&#13;
individual contracts, the General Procurement Notice will be followed by the publication of&#13;
specific announcements in the local newspapers. The bidding documents will be sent to the&#13;
suppliers who will have expressed interest responding to the General Procurement Notice that&#13;
will be updated every year.&#13;
(b)    Bank standard documents on the invitation for bids- The PCU will review the use of&#13;
standard bidding documents approved by the Bank for each procurement method of goods,&#13;
works, and consultant services. Prior approval by the Bank will be required on the model&#13;
documents for every procurement method. The period allowed to submit the bids can be brought&#13;
to thirty days at least.&#13;
6.4   INTERNATIONAL SHOPPING&#13;
International Shopping will be used, as an alternative to Intemational Competitive&#13;
Bidding for the procurement of goods generally available commercially, including equipment,&#13;
materials, and standards products estimated to cost $US100, 000 or less. For International&#13;
Shopping, three quotations from two different countries are required in response to a written&#13;
invitation. The list of suppliers will be prepared starting first by those who expressed an interest&#13;
by responding to the announcements published in the press (For example, General Procurement&#13;
Notice and national newspapers).  In order to get the minimum three quotations, it is&#13;
recommended to solicit more than three suppliers whenever possible, to palliate the possibility&#13;
that some suppliers would not submit any proposals.  Concerning the procedures of&#13;
International/National Shopping, request for proposals can be sent by a telecopy or fax, and the&#13;
proposals submission can follow the same transmission channel.&#13;
6.5    NATIONAL SHOPPING&#13;
This method will be used for the acquisition of supplies generally available in Algeria for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost $US 100, 000 or less. At least three written quotations are required as&#13;
responses to a written solicitation. The preparation of the list of suppliers that will be invited to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
submit proposals will be based on the same principle as applied to International Shopping, but in&#13;
the case of National Shopping, all suppliers can be Algerian.&#13;
6.6 WORKS&#13;
ICB: International Competitive Bidding. The procedures of advertisement and use of&#13;
the proposal for bids are those described under ICB-Goods. The ICB procedures for works will&#13;
be used for each contract estimated to cost US$5 millions or more.&#13;
NCB: National Competitive Bidding. Taking into account the fact that works are&#13;
scattered and by their nature are not appealing to foreign entrepreneurs, NCB will be used for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost more than US$250 000 but less than US$5 millions each. However,&#13;
interested foreign firms will be allowed to participate in the NCB. At least thirty days period will&#13;
be. given for the submission of the bids, (minimum applicable), the actual period depending on&#13;
the nature and the size of the contract. It will not be necessary to go through a pre-selection. A&#13;
standard bidding document of NCB for works will be approved for use, as is the case for ICB.&#13;
No offer will be rejected a priori on the basis of a predetermined maximum or minimum amount&#13;
(Higher and lower limits chosen in advance by reference to the engineer's evaluations). However,&#13;
after evaluation of bids, it will be possible in exceptional cases and with the approval of the Bank,&#13;
to declare the bid as unsuccessful if the lowest responsive bid by a qualified contractor is much&#13;
higher than the amount of the realistically estimated cost of the contract. In this case, a new&#13;
bidding procedure will have to be launched in accordance with articles 2.59 to 2.62 of the Bank's&#13;
procurement guidelines for works.&#13;
The awarding of the contracts will be given to the lowest competitive bidder on the basis&#13;
of criteria of evaluation specified in the Invitation for Bids and no new criteria will be adopted.&#13;
The bid opening will be held on the said day and hour upon the receipt of bids.&#13;
6.7    PROCUREMENT OF SMALL WORKS&#13;
The bidding documents approved by the Bank for smaller works will be used for the&#13;
procurement of works estimated to cost less than US$250,000 per contract. This procurement is&#13;
based on lump sum, flat rate, or unit price depending on the written proposals received from at&#13;
least three qualified contractors f responding to a written solicitation. The simplified documents&#13;
for bidding consist of a detailed description of works, including basic specifications, the planned&#13;
date of completion of the works, a simple contract in conformity with the standard document&#13;
approved by the Bank. The contract will be awarded to the contractor submitting the lowest&#13;
responsive bid for the works required, and having both the experience and necessary resources to&#13;
meet the requirements for the works in the best way.&#13;
6.8    CONSULTANT SERVICES&#13;
Consultant services will be procured on the basis of the Bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;
This includes both the selections on a competitive basis and by direct contract in accordance with&#13;
the paragraphs 3.8 and 3.11 of the Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers. Any contracts, envisaged to be procured by sole-source selection,&#13;
will need to be justified, when a case arises, within the Procurement Plan for each component of&#13;
the project. Quality and Cost Based Selection as well as the selection of individual consultants,&#13;
will be generally applied as procurement methods for consultant services. For a contract&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ho&#13;
estimated less than US$200,000; Quality-Based Selection and Least Cost Selection could also be&#13;
applied.&#13;

7.     Disbursement&#13;
Withdrawals from the proceeds of the loan will be based on the traditional disbursement&#13;
methods of the Bank, using direct payments, requests for special commitments and&#13;
reimbursement applications, either fully documented or using Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
as per applicable procedures. As projected by Bank's standard disbursement profiles,&#13;
disbursements would be completed four months after project closure. Disbursements would be&#13;
made against standard Bank documentation.&#13;
7.1    SPECIAL ACCOUNT (SA):&#13;
To facilitate disbursement of eligible expenditures for goods &amp; services the borrower&#13;
will open and maintain a special account at the Banque d'Algerie (the Central Bank of Algeria) to&#13;
cover eligible project expenditures to be managed and administered by the Banque Algerienne de&#13;
Developpement (BAD). Authorized allocation of the special account would be US$6,000,000&#13;
covering an estimated 4 months of eligible expenditures financed by the loan. Banque Algerienne&#13;
de Developpement (BAD) will submit monthly replenishment applications with appropriate&#13;
supporting documentation, including reconciled bank statements, for expenditures incurred and&#13;
will retain and make the documents available for review by Bank supervision missions and&#13;
project auditors .To the extent possible, all eligible project expenditures should be paid through&#13;
the special account. Specifically all eligible project expenditures of less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent shall be paid from the SA.&#13;
7.2    USE OF STATEMENT OF EXPENDITURE (SOES):&#13;
All applications to withdraw proceeds from the grant will be fully documented, except&#13;
for: (i) expenditures of contracts for goods with an estimated value of US$250,000 or less; ii)&#13;
expenditures of contracts for works with an estimnated value of US$500,000 or less iii)&#13;
expenditures of contracts for consulting firms with an estimated value of US$100,000 or less and&#13;
(iii) US$50,000 or less for individual consultants, which may be claimed on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting expenditures claimed against&#13;
Sues will be retained by the BAD and will be available for review when requested by Bank&#13;
supervision missions and project auditors. All disbursements will be subject to the conditions of&#13;
the grant Agreement and the procedures defined in the Disbursement Letter.&#13;
7.3   RETROACTIVE FINANCING&#13;
The retroactive financing which amounts to $US500,000 would be applied to the&#13;
expenses which occurred after July 1, 2002, covering consultant services, deforestation and other&#13;
emergency works. The services of the consultants concern the first phases of the detailed design,&#13;
the works of flooding prevention, and those works of reforestation that must start before the next&#13;
rainy season. The contracts that must be financed retroactively include specifically the following:&#13;
EPW2.04 and EPW2.05 (Construction of installation of big cages or gabions), EPW2.07 and&#13;
EPW2.08 (Reforestation), EPW2.14 (different services of consultation), PM3.04 and PM3.06&#13;
(Equipment and vehicles for the management of the project'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
7.4   INFORMATION FLOW&#13;
Homogenization and harmonization will be sought to the extent possible in areas such as&#13;
the methods and accounting presentations, the Financial Management Reports, (so as to be in&#13;
accordance with the models of the IBRD), and the software for the financial management of the&#13;
project (monitoring, evaluation, and audit). Therefore, the flow of documentation will be as&#13;
follows:&#13;
The PCU will transmit the original of the relevant receipts to the BAD for payment operations&#13;
and will keep a copy of the transmitted documents;&#13;
The BAD will update the description form of the operation. It will keep the original of the&#13;
documents and files as well as the debit statements issued by the Bank of Algeria or the World&#13;
Bank. It will make a copy of the accounting statements of the Special Account to send as well as&#13;
that of the loan account to PCU and General Direction of External Financial Relations of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance (DGRFE), and to the World Bank. Otherwise, a copy of this accounting will&#13;
be transmitted monthly to the DGRFE; and&#13;
The Bank of Algeria will transmit to the BAD, a monthly summary of the special account even&#13;
though no operation has been done during the considered month.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

8      FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
8.1 GENERAL VIEW&#13;
All agencies involved in the project (Wilaya of Algiers, ONM, DGPC, ANRH) are&#13;
government agencies subject to the public accounting rules as defined by the legal framework&#13;
applicable to the public sector.&#13;
The Wilaya of Algiers is the implementing agency of the project and will establish a&#13;
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to facilitate the implementation. Basically, the financial&#13;
management functions on the project will be divided between the PCU and BAD (Banque&#13;
Algerienne de Developpement). The PCU will be responsible for the project accounting and&#13;
reporting functions including: booking accounting transactions, record keeping, verification of&#13;
supporting documents, preparing bank reconciliation, preparing periodic reports and financial&#13;
statements, and preparing Payment Vouchers along with the verified supporting documents and&#13;
send them to BAD for payments, as well as monitoring the Special Account (established at the&#13;
Central Bank of Algeria). While BAD will be responsible for the administration of the Special&#13;
Account and issues Payment Orders (withdrawn on the Special Account in the Central Bank)&#13;
after verification of the supporting documents received along the Payment Voucher received from&#13;
the PCU. BAD will keep track of transactions incurred on the Special Account and prepare&#13;
Withdrawal Application to replenish the Special Account. Accordingly, the PCU is responsible&#13;
for the accounting and reporting aspects except for issuing Payment Orders and administration of&#13;
the Special Account, which belong to BAD.&#13;
Each of the implementing agencies will be entitled to conduct its own procurement,&#13;
however, payments to contractor and supplier will be made by BAD through the PCU based on&#13;
proper supporting documentation.&#13;
Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be prepared by the PCU and sent to the&#13;
Bank within 45 days from period-end. Annual financial statements of the project will be audited&#13;
by the government audit department (Inspection Generale des Finances).&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) will be prepared for the project on a quarterly basis&#13;
within 45 days of the end of each quarter by the PCU. The set of FMRs will include: summary&#13;
progress reports on project implementation, cost per component for the quarter and cumulative&#13;
costs incurred per expenditure type, project balance sheets, and withdrawals made based on&#13;
contracts below the stated threshold.&#13;
The PCU will prepare annual project financial statements (project balance sheet, Special&#13;
Account statement, and cash flow) and arrange for audits to be submitted to the Bank in&#13;
accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) by an independent auditor with TORs&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The audited financial statements along with the auditor's opinion will be&#13;
sent to the Bank within six months of year-end.&#13;
8.2    FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT (FM) ASSESSMENT&#13;
The financial management assessment conducted for all participating agencies revealed&#13;
that the financial management systems in place are adequate and meet the minimum the&#13;
requirements of the Bank. However, as these FM systems are specific for government reporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
purposes, they are not equipped to generate project reports required by Bank to facilitate financial&#13;
monitoring of the project. For the implementing agency, the Wilaya of Algiers, it is estimated&#13;
that such deficiency requires approximately six months to upgrade the system to generate these&#13;
reports (dated covenant). In the meantime, the PCU will use simplified computer spreadsheet&#13;
tables to enable generation of project's required reports during the first six months of the project&#13;
implementation required for system upgrading.&#13;
8.3    ACCOUNTING SYSTEM&#13;
The project accounting will be the responsibility of the PCU in the Wilaya of Algiers,&#13;
which will maintain all accounting records, supporting documents, undertake booking all&#13;
financial transactions, prepare quarterly reports, prepare annual financial statements, and send all&#13;
payment supporting documents for BAD to prepare Payment Order to the Central Bank, after&#13;
examination of the supporting documents, to execute the payments. Accounting for the project&#13;
will be on cash basis in line with government and BAD accounting. BAD will send monthly&#13;
bank statement to the PCU to allow proper monitoring of the Special Account and facilitate&#13;
preparing bank reconciliation and check accuracy and completeness of transactions incurred.&#13;
Detailed accounting and disbursement procedures, as well as procurement, will be part of the&#13;
Project Implementation Manual (PIM).&#13;
8.4    PROCEDURES OF INTERNAL CONTROL&#13;
The Internal Control Procedures put in place at the Wilaya of Algiers (and the other&#13;
concerned agencies) is based upon the governmental system as set by the laws and the&#13;
regulations, that are accepted by the Bank and do not present any problem of responsibility. For&#13;
the objectives of the project, the PIM will define the procedures of control and the relation&#13;
between the implementation agency (Wilaya of Algiers) and the other involved agencies (ONM,&#13;
ANRH, and the DGPC), as well as the BAD, which is in charge of the financial management of&#13;
the project. In addition, the PIM also defines the procedures of acquisition for the project that&#13;
must be conforming to the recommendations of the World Bank. The transactions of acquisitions&#13;
entered into by the implementing units will be undertaken according to PIM and the supporting&#13;
documents will be sent to the PCU for verification and registering in the accounting system of the&#13;
project. Then, these documents will be transmitted by PCU to the BAD for verification and&#13;
payment of the firms and suppliers. In order to facilitate this task, and before the beginning of the&#13;
year, every concerned agency will prepare and will accept an annual equipment plan in&#13;
coordination with the PCU.&#13;
8.5    FLOW OF FUNDS&#13;
Loan proceeds will be transferred to the Special Account, established at the Central Bank&#13;
of Algeria, and solely managed by BAD. The PCU will prepare payment voucher and attach all&#13;
verified supporting documents and sent them to BAD for verification and preparing payment&#13;
order to the Central Bank to execute the payment to contractors/supplier,&#13;
BAD will manage disbursements, reconcile expenditures with approved budgets,&#13;
consolidate and reconcile project expenditures with the Bank's Loan statements, and prepare&#13;
replenishment of the Special Account. As mentioned above, each of the involved units (Wilaya&#13;
of Algiers, ONM, ANRH, and DGPC) is entitled to conduct its own procurement, however, all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
accounting will be centralized in the PCU to and then sent by the PCU to BAD for payment&#13;
process.&#13;
8.6    FINANCIAL MONITORING REPORTS&#13;
The PCU will prepare the Financial Management Reports and will send them non-audited&#13;
at the Bank within the 45 days following every end-of-quarter. The Financial Management&#13;
Reports will include (a) a general progress report about Project implementation (b) the cost by&#13;
component for the quarter (c) the costs incurred by type of expenses (d) the project balance sheet&#13;
and (e) the acquisitions incurred on contracts under the established threshold. The project&#13;
statement of accounts will be put in place to facilitate the automatic generation of the reports of&#13;
financial controls. The contents and the format of the reports will be prepared by the consultant&#13;
and subject to agreement during the negotiations. By the same token, each unit in charge will&#13;
prepare a quarterly general report on its activities pertaining to the project, and on the physical&#13;
progress implementation. These quarterly reports will be sent to the PCU within the 30 days&#13;
following the end of every quarter.&#13;
8.7    AUDIT&#13;
The project accounts and the yearly financial statements (project balance sheet, the flow&#13;
of funds, and the statement of the Special Account) will be subjected to a yearly audit. It will be&#13;
conducted in accordance to international standards, and by an independent auditor acceptable to&#13;
the Bank, and under the conditions of reference followed by the Bank. The Audit will examine all&#13;
sources of the funds of the project, including the Bank loan. In the same way, it will also&#13;
examine all incurred expenses including those related to the statements of the expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) by ascertaining their conformity with the Loan Agreement. An auditor will present an&#13;
honest opinion on the project financial statements: In addition the auditor will supply a separated&#13;
viewpoint on the eligibility of all incurred expenses that are included in the SOEs. The Audit&#13;
report should be sent to the Bank not later than six months after the end of the year.&#13;
8.8    RISKS&#13;
The project's financial management risk is considered moderate. This consideration is the&#13;
result of the following: (a) the PCU is an entity that is newly created and therefore has no&#13;
experience dealing within the projects financed by the Bank; (b) Other entities are involved in the&#13;
project, and conflicts of procedures and/or of authority could generate some delays in its&#13;
realization; and (c) the migration of financial data from the simplified monitoring system toward&#13;
an integrated accounting system, and the upgrading of the monitoring and accounting systems.&#13;
These risks will be mitigated by: recruiting a qualified consultant; by upgrading the system of&#13;
monitoring and accounting; a rigorous control by the Bank experts during the first year of&#13;
implementation; and the provision of technical support to the project team as well as to the PCU&#13;
during the first year via training and workshops.&#13;

ATTACHMENT 1: THE SOCIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THE AFFECTED&#13;
POPULATION&#13;
The people affected by the floods reside in two types of districts that are in full contrast&#13;
based upon their urban history and the way in which they were populated. One can divide these&#13;
sets of districts into two categories:&#13;
a) The first group of districts is composed of early settled areas where the form of urbanization&#13;
(more than 45%) is made out of collective buildings with several floors. These are the communes&#13;
of Bab-EI-Oued, Casbah, Alger-Centre, El Biar and Hammamet.&#13;
b) The second group is made up of more recently urbanized districts where the main building is&#13;
the individual residence. These are the communes of Oued Koriche, Bouzareah, Bologhine, Rais&#13;
Hamidou and Beni-Messous.&#13;
Maps I and 2 provide the distribution of the forms of residential occupation in the&#13;
concerned zone.&#13;
An examination of these two maps reveals that the communes belonging to the first type&#13;
regroup densely populated old urban zones like Bab-EI-Oued, the Casbah, El Biar and Alger-&#13;
Centre, and a more recently urbanized commune that had received an important number of social&#13;
collective apartments since 1975 (Hammamet). In the second type, one notices two categories of&#13;
communes: those which developed since the beginning of the century (Bouzareah, Bologhine and&#13;
RaYs Hamidous) and those which constituted, to various degrees, the area where the poor&#13;
migrated in the early sixties during the independence of the country (Oued Konche and Beni-&#13;
Messous).&#13;

One also notices on maps 3 and 4 that the communes belonging to the second category&#13;
(individual housing which is characterized, among others factors, by vacant and non-urbanized&#13;
land) received the biggest part of the dilapidated and illegal housing due to the topography of the&#13;
region. It is necessary, in this regard to stress the position of the commune of Oued Koriche that&#13;
is indeed considered being the most underprivileged. This commune received the least amount of&#13;
the social housing program. In addition, this communes regroups the strongest concentration of&#13;
people which has settled without permit and whose life is highly precarious.&#13;
It is also necessary to notice the existence of illegal housing in the communes&#13;
surrounding Oued Koriche and the occupation of the slopes of the massif of Bouzareah whose&#13;
fringes are, thanks to administrative divisions, integrated to the territory of these communes.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
Process of densification of neighborhoods&#13;
On the other hand and to the contrary to a widespread idea, it seems that from the&#13;
viewpoint of the processes of densification and urbanization, the communes of Oued Koriche did&#13;
not witness migration of new population during the census period 1987/1998. The main part of&#13;
migratory growth went into the communes of the secondary peripheral fringe. The biggest&#13;
majority of the people residing in the affected zone, based upon data of the 1998 census, have&#13;
settled there for more than at least 15 years. They have been living in dilapidated and illegal&#13;
housing that spread further.&#13;
Information shows that the last period 1987/1998 was essentially a period of&#13;
consolidation of the residential construction by those that migrated in the zone before the eighties.&#13;
This process was characterized by the construction of shacks and other precarious housing of new&#13;
households of the second generation of migrants that came mostly from the immediate&#13;
surrounding sites. This in fact indicates a process of sociological and economic integration into&#13;
the city.&#13;
Livelihood and housing conditions of the target population&#13;
The life conditions of the people of the affected communes can be described by three&#13;
indicators relative to access to basic services: water supply, electricity and sanitation. The&#13;
communes of Oued Koriche, Bouzareah, and similar adjacent communes, which have&#13;
experienced an increase of poor people, are by far less equipped than the communes formerly&#13;
urbanized such as Alger-Centre or Bab-EI-Oued.&#13;
However, taking into account the level of occupancy rates per apartment unit (ORA), one&#13;
can notice the following differences according to the statistics provided by the Wilaya: the&#13;
population census by communes on the eve of the floods produced the following rate: 8.2 in the&#13;
commune of Oued Koriche in 2001 whereas the census of 1998 estimated it at 6.19; and 7.49 for&#13;
Bab-EI-Oued in 2001 against 6.68 for 1998. One can see, in this difference of numbers provided&#13;
by the census and those collected by the administration, the fact that the latter has overestimated&#13;
the number of inhabitants. In any case, this ORA shows that the communes of Bab-EI-Oued and&#13;
Oued Koriche appear in relation to the other communes of the Wilaya as being the most&#13;
overcrowded.&#13;
Activities and income&#13;
The bulk of income comes from the active population, mainly the head of households,&#13;
and more than 90% among them have an income, except for Bab-EI-Oued where the percentage&#13;
is 87%. However, many businesses and professional premises were carried away by the floods&#13;
mainly in the district of Bab-EI-Oued where many people found themselves without resources&#13;
and had some difficulties to resume their commercial or trade activities. The statistical data&#13;
conceming these areas are not available. The estimates established by the authorities of the&#13;
Wilaya (on the basis of a sample of 1,000 head of households among the 5,300 counted in the&#13;
zone after the flooding) show the following:&#13;
a)     35% of the head of households exercised "occasional jobs" which in the&#13;
vocabulary of the administration means "informal activities",&#13;
b)     5% only practiced trade activities in the area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
This means that the rest of the heads of households, almost three-quarters of them, were&#13;
holding more or less regular jobs in the rest of the city.&#13;
The above data shows that this population is fully integrated into the urban economy of&#13;
Algiers. It also seems that this population is long established in the city and has constituted a&#13;
powerful factor of economic integration. Therefore, these are not apparently newcomers who are&#13;
seeking insertion in the job market in Algiers.&#13;
Levels of education&#13;
The rate of general illiteracy among the total population (6 years old and above) is lower&#13;
in relation to the national level (32%). However, when one considers certain level of illiteracy&#13;
(minimum alphabetization and primary level), the rate includes half of the population. In other&#13;
words, in spite of a relatively lower rate of illiteracy, the populations of these communes remain&#13;
insufficiently educated. This data reinforces the previous reports on the earlier settlement of the&#13;
population in these areas. The level of instruction is above the national average, notably in the&#13;
district of Oued Koriche and its immediate vicinity. Although this area is characterized as&#13;
mentioned previously by the precariousness of the housing, its positive percentage of instruction&#13;
is an indication that these populations were established there for a sufficient period of time, being&#13;
able to send their children to the surrounding schools. This in turn has produced a higher general&#13;
level of instruction of the population.&#13;
Report on dependants&#13;
A person having an income based on a given activity, on retirement, or on a pension&#13;
supports (on average) 7 dependents (with size of the household as well as the proportion of the&#13;
heads of household having an income considered). The households headed by a woman constitute&#13;
a non-negligible part of the whole, especially in Bologhine and Oued Koriche.&#13;
Community Aspects&#13;
There is no specific survey on the community organization aspects in the assessed zone&#13;
that would be worth quoting. University studies undertaken in the district of Diar El Kef in&#13;
Djenan Hassans, in spite of their partial character, show the existence of a large movement of new&#13;
households whose parents have been living in the zone since the sixties. These new households&#13;
have built their own shacks on the lower side of these residential units. This also shows the&#13;
existence of a strong and homogeneous community living in the area. The people originating&#13;
from a given region tended to regroup in the same part of the areas. This model has been&#13;
disrupted somewhat lately following a phenomenon of residential mobility caused by the small&#13;
operations of relocation that targeted the local populations. This, however, did not upset the&#13;
previous housing model.&#13;
The content of the Project&#13;
The Project of the reduction of the vulnerability of the zones affected by the flooding of&#13;
November 10, 2001 has two main objectives: (a) providing the Algerian government authorities&#13;
with human, material, and organizational means to enable them to intervene in an efficient&#13;
manner in case of natural disasters; and (b) setting up a sizable integrated and systematic plan&#13;
aiming at the reduction of the vulnerability on both the physical and social levels of the zones&#13;
affected by the floods that hit the city of Algiers in November 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
This project is composed of the following two key components:&#13;
a)     Reinforcing the institutional capacities of prevention and management of the natural&#13;
disasters at the national leveL In this component, it is expected to put in place a series of&#13;
organizational measures, institutional procedures, and means allowing the fast and efficient&#13;
handling of natural disasters at the level of the territory of the Wilaya of Algiers or nationwide.&#13;
b)     Reducing the vulnerability of urban zones weakened by the flooding of November 10,&#13;
2001, notably by restructuring and rehabilitating these zones by re-housing the affected families&#13;
in the Wilaya of Algiers. In this respect, the Algerian authorities preferred to follow the principle&#13;
of an integrated approach permitting to treat, in a coordinated way, the question of vulnerability&#13;
in its various formns (natural, environmental, urban and social). In this connection, a series of&#13;
measures will be implemented in the Wilaya of Algiers: (i) Repairing the damages caused by the&#13;
flooding around the massif of Bouzar6ah and the basin side of Oued Koriche, (ii) Taking care of&#13;
the affected zone to reduce its vulnerability, and (iii) conducting re-housing activities for the&#13;
groups exposed to the risks in the affected zones and weakened by inclement weather.&#13;
Conditions for re-housing&#13;
The re-housing solution of the inhabitants residing in the affected zones that are more or&#13;
less near their present places of residence is the option that has been retained for a certain number&#13;
of imperative reasons. This situation stems from the modalities of the technical treatment of the&#13;
affected zones. Indeed, a certain number of inescapable technical constraints are described in the&#13;
following:&#13;
a) The very unsteady character of the soil along the basin barring high-rise constructions;&#13;
b) The saturation of the collective facilities (i.e., triple vacation in the schools);&#13;
c) The recommendations of the experts for the reconstitution of the vegetal landscape of the&#13;
basins and for the realization of works of the ways and other networks;&#13;
d) The lack of land to be used for construction in the zone capable to shelter the targeted&#13;
population; and&#13;
e) The very high level of urbanization in the space closer-to the affected zone makes it difficult to&#13;
keep the greater part of the inhabitants in the same area. This concerns mainly families who live&#13;
in buildings that were part of the census undertaken by the Wilaya government and currently&#13;
classified as "vulnerable to risks". In summary, after the floods, a number of families are now&#13;
exposed to worse conditions and risks than the precariousness in daily life they used to face&#13;
before.&#13;
The nature of the works to be achieved has to do essentially with physical planning of the&#13;
zone, which entail the following: reinforcement of embankments, demolition of all constructions&#13;
facilitating erosion of the slopes, and reconstitution of the protective vegetation to prevent&#13;
erosion. These works cannot be satisfied while maintaining the precarious construction on the&#13;
basin side of Oued Koriche and its channels undertaken without taking into account the rules of&#13;
security. These constructions were erected in an illegal manner (without obtaining of a building&#13;
permit and other official housing documents) and spread over an area with the least real estate&#13;
value. This is the result of the fact that the area was completely ignored by public or private urban&#13;
developers. As a result, this zone does not present minimal conditions that would plead for the&#13;
population to remain on site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
Other arguments, sociological in nature, show that the resettlement of the people, even if&#13;
it derives from technical recommendations as described above, will receive the support from the&#13;
population. These arguments are justified as follows:&#13;
a) The report undertaken by the municipalities shows that considerable requests for social&#13;
housing have been submitted to the municipalities' social services and housing departments of the&#13;
affected zone. Therefore, when one learns that that these requests were made for an apartment in&#13;
undetermined locations or in sites distant and outside the municipality where the request is&#13;
submitted, it obviously shows that people directly express their readiness to move wherever the&#13;
authorities intend to relocate them;&#13;
b) According to the observations made by the authorities (in charge of the Plan ORSEC&#13;
implemented after the floods) and by independent witnesses (especially by journalists of the&#13;
written press), there has been an extraordinary increase of re-housing requests for the sites&#13;
proposed by the Government. These requests were not only made by disaster victims, but also by&#13;
families outside the zone attracted by the offer despite the distance of the new sites;&#13;
c) The highly marginal character of the types of professional activities undertaken in the premises&#13;
built in the affected zone is due to the precarious and uneven topography of the zone that&#13;
generally does not offer direct access aside from winding trails along the Bouzareah massif;&#13;
d) The nature of the proposed housing, offered in replacement for present illegal precarious&#13;
constructions, constitutes an advantage for the beneficiaries; and&#13;
e) Finally, the workplaces of the local inhabitants are generally located far away from their&#13;
present residences. Thus, the argument that the distance between the places of work, and&#13;
dwellings provided in the new re-housing could have a potentially adverse impact needs to be re-&#13;
examined.&#13;
Solutions retained for the Project&#13;
The solutions for re-housing retained in the Project consists in offering a completely&#13;
equipped social rental housing units called type F3 for 1.2 millions Dinars to each of the 5000&#13;
affected families. These apartments will be located in part of the seven (7) sites chosen by the&#13;
authorities of the Wilaya of Algiers. These sites are urban land in good conditions and with all&#13;
basic services available. Five of the seven proposed sites are situated between 1 to 1.5 km of the&#13;
zone Ain Malha (Birkhadem), Draria, Route de S' Haoula (Draria), City Center of S'Haoula&#13;
(S'Haoula), Belle Vue (Ain Benian), Domaine Bel Haddadi and locality of Sidi Youssef (Beni-&#13;
Messous). The other two, which have not been finalized yet, are located at the distance of about&#13;
5 to 10 kilometers from the current place of residence. Each site will accommodate between 300&#13;
and 2,000 apartment units. This housing will provide all necessary and basic services and socio-&#13;
cultural facilities (schools, centers of health, etc.) that are required by the Algerian urban&#13;
regulations.&#13;
In order to compensate for potential business losses through resettlement, the first floors&#13;
of each apartment building will be reserved for business and commercial activities. They will be&#13;
allocated for those whose business suffered a loss on the affected sites by the floods. At the end&#13;
of the re-housing operations, the concerned population will benefit from a better quality&#13;
apartment or a business office space. They will find more favorable standards of living at these&#13;
new sites in terms of opportunity for schooling their children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan&#13;
The Algerian authority maintains the principle of developing an elaborate Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan (RAP) that presents the entire process to ensure satisfactory and timely operation of&#13;
re-housing. This Plan is designed to address the following basic principles:&#13;
a)     Avoiding, as much as possible, involuntary population resettlement by taking&#13;
into account all the realistic alternatives;&#13;
b)     Seeking, whenever the resettlements are unavoidable, solutions allowing the&#13;
resettled population to rebuild their livelihoods and their means of subsistence to a level&#13;
at least equal, if not higher, than those that existed before their resettlement; and&#13;
c)     Consulting the concerned population by using appropriate means and inviting the&#13;
beneficiaries to fully and effectively participate in the planning and implementation of the&#13;
resettlement programs.&#13;
Thus, the following arrangements will hold:&#13;
a)     The population that will be resettled under the project will involve only those&#13;
whose dwellings present risks of collapse and concurrently eligible to the social rental&#13;
housing as outlined in the provisions of the Executive Decree 98-42 of February 1st,&#13;
1998, which - in turn - underline the need for transparency in housing allocation&#13;
procedures to the APCs 2;&#13;
b)     The families whose dwellings are vulnerable but do not qualify under the social&#13;
rental housing program as stipulated in the Executive Decree 98-42, will be oriented&#13;
towards other programs such as public housing development [logement promotionel]&#13;
programs and Rent-to Buy [Location-Vente] schemes;&#13;
c)     The families whose dwellings are not categorized as vulnerable and whose&#13;
presence is not a threat to the achievement of objective for the vulnerability reduction of&#13;
the zone will be maintained.&#13;
In any case, a provisional Resettlement Action Plan will be elaborated by February 2003&#13;
at the latest in order to document all these aspects. The finalized Resettlement Action Plan will&#13;
complete this. The Plan will be adopted upon disclosure of the lists of beneficiaries, established&#13;
in accordance with to the provisions described in the Resettlement Policy Framework.&#13;
Implementation Process&#13;
Entire implementation arrangements for re-housing follows the principles and procedures&#13;
defined in the Resettlement Policy Framework. The management of the re-housing process will&#13;
be entrusted to the Special Ad-hoc Committee comprised of all the parties concerned in the&#13;
operation. To carry out re-housing operations, the principle modalities of this Committee should&#13;
be based on the socio-economic studies and of the Resettlement Action Plan. The Committee&#13;
will liaise its actions with the outcome of the consultation with the concerned population.&#13;
Consultations will be carried out through questionnaires to determine the sites of their choice or&#13;
2 Ref. Resettlement Policy Framework for the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
through direct consultations with the concerned population. The respect of the populations'&#13;
desires has been adopted as an essential working principle.&#13;
The re-housing of the population in these sites will only begin once the housing&#13;
construction is completely finished according to the requirements stipulated in Algerian&#13;
regulation in effect.&#13;

ATTACHMENT 2: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
This project originated from the recognized need to reduce the vulnerability to natural&#13;
disaster of the Bouzareah massif in Algiers following the November 10, 2001 flash flood that&#13;
provoked more that 700 hundred casualties in this area alone as well as hundreds of millions&#13;
dollars material damages.&#13;
The cause of the disaster was a centennial rain that poured in the area during a few hours&#13;
time period that transformed into an extremely violent flash flood of water and mud. The intensity&#13;
of the flash flood was without doubt magnified by the improper urban development of the area&#13;
that has taken place over the years. The environmental imbalance that it has caused ultimately&#13;
decreased the capacity of the soil to absorb the run-off, destabilized the slopes and oued&#13;
embankments and favored landslides and sudden soil erosion that caused the mixed flow of water&#13;
and mud along the urbanized oued beds.&#13;
Most of the directly affected people whose houses or shelters have been destroyed&#13;
beyond possibility of rehabilitation have been taken care and re-housed within a few weeks after&#13;
the disaster. However, the authorities and the WVorld Bank recognized the need for a more&#13;
thorough treatment of the vulnerability of the area. In particular, in order to avoid a new disaster,&#13;
it has been decided de relocate about 5,000 families in the affected area who live in vulnerable&#13;
and hazardous locations.&#13;
At the same time, the project will contribute to the design and implementation of a&#13;
monitoring and early warning system in the region!of Algiers as a pilot towards extension of the&#13;
system at a national level.&#13;
Finally, the project has identified medium-term activities that will contribute to&#13;
significant decrease of the vulnerability of the area. These works will focus on slope and oueds&#13;
improvements as well as drainage improvement of the. area. An integrated vulnerability reduction&#13;
study of the affected area will serve as a decision:making instrument and will identify after an&#13;
thorough multi-sector and multi-disciplinary audit' the institutional, regulatory and investment&#13;
measures to be taken in the medium and long term.&#13;
Environmental Management Framework&#13;
The Algerian authorities and the World Bank recognize the necessity to take proper steps&#13;
in order to ensure that the project will be developed upon sound environmental and social&#13;
grounds. The environmental safeguards of the Bank as set forth by the Operational Policy 4.01.&#13;
The emergency nature of the intervention and the applicability of O.P 8.50 which defines the&#13;
streamlined preparation procedure for emergency project triggers article 13 of the O.P. 4.01&#13;
which waives the necessity of prior Environmental assessment for emergency project. However,&#13;
an environmental management framework has been prepared prior to negotiation and details the&#13;
expected impacts of the different components and indicates the mitigation measures to be&#13;
developed during the course of the project. Being a framework this document mainly details the&#13;
procedures for sub-project screening and for possible subsequent environmental assessments of&#13;
sub-projects, supervision and monitoring procedures. The Environmental management framework&#13;
indicates also the linkage with environmental section of the Vulnerability reduction study to be&#13;
developed during project implementation. This study will analyze in detail the risks towards&#13;
natural hazards of the area covered by the study and will identify institutional, regulatory and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
investment measures in order to decrease the level of environmental risks for the population and&#13;
the ecosystem.&#13;
Sub-components environmental screening&#13;
The EMF identifies the Inspectorate of Environment of the Wilaya of Algiers (IEWA) as&#13;
the main entity concerned with the environmental management aspects of the project. The IEWA&#13;
will develop a screening system for the main sub-component of the system such as:&#13;
(a)    Works conducted by Forest Conservatory as part of Component 2&#13;
(b)    Works conducted by the Waterworks directorate as part of Component 2&#13;
(c)    Works conducted by the Housing directorate as part of Component 2,&#13;
particularly with regards to:&#13;
(i) Selection of sites for the new housing program&#13;
(ii) Building of housing units&#13;
Environmental assessment as part of the vulnerability reduction study&#13;
Moreover, the IEWA will, review and provide comments and input during the preparation&#13;
of the integrated vulnerability reduction study to be developed during project implementation.&#13;
Supervision and monitoring&#13;
The IEWA will carry supervision and monitoring responsibilities during project&#13;
implementation. The format of the reporting system to be followed will be defined within the&#13;
Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
The IEWA will also have the responsibility to coordinate the information and public&#13;
disclosure activities of the project arrangements with regards to environmental and social&#13;
protection in a manner consistent with what has been defined in the Resettlement Policy&#13;
Framework and the Environmental Management Framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ATTACHMENT 3: REINFORCING THE COUNTRY CAPACITIES TO FACE NATURAL&#13;
DISASTERS&#13;
For the government institutions for disaster management to respond efficiently to sudden&#13;
and violent natural disasters such as the one hit the city of Algiers, it requires integrated and&#13;
coordinated management efforts and essentially the capacity to forecast the upcoming disasters&#13;
and mobilize adequate mitigation measures to reduce the potential impact the expected disasters.&#13;
The first component of the project consists of a series of actions that are complementary, actions&#13;
centered on the objective of the Component I that is the strengthening of national capacity for&#13;
natural disaster management. The key elements comprising this component are as follows:&#13;
(a)    The studies (Sub-component 1): In brief, the sub-component involves a study and the&#13;
establishment of a rapid early alert system. The main objectives are: i) Developing the capacities&#13;
to coordinate among concerned institutions; ii) Improving information and communication&#13;
systems, iii) Determining the levels of risk and vulnerability of the communities and property in&#13;
case of natural disasters, iv) Establishing the action plans and simulating scenarios for&#13;
coordinated interventions, v) periodical performance evaluation; vi) Determining the&#13;
responsibilities and the initiatives of the actors, and vii) Elaborating post-disaster risks&#13;
management scenarios.&#13;
A set of two studies will be undertaken to deal with the proposal to draft solutions for&#13;
situations of strong potential risks. The first study will focus on selected zones of the Wilaya of&#13;
Algiers ("The study on vulnerability to natural hazards in the Wilaya of Algiers outside of&#13;
Bouzareah Massif"). The second study focuses on the Bouzareah massif ("Integrated study on&#13;
vulnerability reduction strategies of the Bouzareah Massif'). These two studies will define&#13;
the nature of the corrective measures for Algiers and the priority measures for the protection of&#13;
the Bouzareah massif against risks of flooding and seismic vibrations.&#13;
In addition, the Scientific study on the phenomenon that led to the disaster of November&#13;
9/10, 2001 will be conducted. This Study aims at upgrading the capacities of forecasting by the&#13;
engineers and the scientists of the National Meteorology Office. This Office is entrusted with the&#13;
forecasting of the weather in the country. This study deals also with the treatment and the&#13;
analysis of data on the subject. Finally "The study of the integrated system for monitoring and&#13;
early warning for floods in the Wilaya of Algiers" aims at assisting the ONM and DGPC in&#13;
developing an early warning system for floods.&#13;
(b)    The second important subcomponent concentrates on training: this goes hand in hand and&#13;
is complementary with the objective of the first sub-component. This includes short-term training&#13;
with hands-on equipment and software, training courses for enhancing the new technological&#13;
skills and the interpretations of the radar information or use of imagery satellite. A training of&#13;
trainers program is also included for selected schools that fall under the umbrella of the&#13;
institutions such as the ONM, the ANRH or the DGPC to reinforce their educational programs.&#13;
(c)    The third subcomponent is no less important and concerns the improvement of equipment&#13;
for the concerned organizations to meet their needs during interventions wherever a disaster&#13;
strikes. Needs assessment of these institutions was conducted based on both the emergency and&#13;
post-disaster experiences of the November 2001 Floods in Algiers.&#13;
&#13;

Equipment subcomponent is closely related to the reinforcement of institutional&#13;
capacities. The equipments are required particularly in terms of; (i) field intervention (e.g.&#13;
special contraptions for cleaning narrow alleys); (ii) technical or scientific facilities (e.g. Doppler&#13;
Radar weather report for the improvement of the weather forecasting coverage); (iii) facilities in&#13;
terms of data processing and the communication (e.g. software for GIS, Remote Detection and&#13;
Remote Sensing Systems, satellite imagery, numeric cartography, database, internet and intranet&#13;
for communication).&#13;

ATTACHMENT 4: INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
Infrastructure works will be undertaken in two stages: the first stage, which takes place&#13;
right after the identification and analysis of risks in the massif of Bouzareah zone, will define the&#13;
actions to be followed in the Summary Draft Project (APS), and the second stage which will be&#13;
dedicated to the elaboration of technical specifications to implement what are deemed important&#13;
actions for the protection of the massif Bouzareah against the risks of floods and seismic&#13;
vibrations. The planned "Integrated study on vulnerability reduction strategies of the Bouzareah&#13;
Massif " will cover the above two stages (see Attachment 3).&#13;
First step of the Study&#13;
The objective of this Study is to evaluate the current status of vulnerability of the zone of&#13;
the Bouzareah massif taking into consideration the risks of floods and seismic vibrations, to&#13;
identify the potential damage, and to analyze the factors leading to such a situation.&#13;
Some of these factors to be considered in the Study are:&#13;
* Urbanization process not coherent to mitigate the risks that threaten the zone;&#13;
* Badly sized channels with high level torrential incidence;&#13;
* Unclean channels;&#13;
* Instability of the slopes of the hills and Oueds characterized by gullies and&#13;
erosions;&#13;
* Uncollected garbage, badly stored rubbles and construction debris obstructing&#13;
water drainage;&#13;
* Insufficient, maladjusted, and/or badly maintained rain water drainage systems;&#13;
* Insufficient and maladjusted sewerage system;&#13;
* Insufficient management of running storm waters along the roads and channels&#13;
endangering the circulation; and&#13;
* Constructions not taking into account the risks of earthquakes in terms of&#13;
locations and structures.&#13;
This Study will propose measures and actions to largely mitigate the damage in case of a&#13;
disaster. In this regard, the Study concentrates on the following:&#13;
*   Updating the urban plans of the target zone to define the land use in view of&#13;
limiting the risks of natural disasters. This study includes a socio-economic&#13;
analysis;&#13;
*   Establishing a plan for circulation to enhance a speedy evacuation of the&#13;
population and to facilitate rescue squads' access to affected zones;&#13;
*   Geo-technical and seismic micro-zoning of the Bouzareah massif (i.e. 12 Oueds,&#13;
9 communes, stretching over 4,600 hectares), and of the fault zone to determine&#13;
high-risk and moderate-risk zones;&#13;
*   Studying a hydraulic system for discharging storm water in Bouzareah massif,&#13;
and conducting a computer simulation of the discharge into the big collectors in&#13;
the project zone. An optimal option pertaining to the land use in the urban plans&#13;
will be proposed based on the coefficients for run-offs calculated through&#13;
computer simulations; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
Examining the existing storm water evacuation and sewerage systems. Through&#13;
the diagnosis of the system, including exhaustive verifications over the primary&#13;
structures, the Study determines the current capacity as well as the need for&#13;
reinforcement and/or extension. It assesses how to the adapt the current&#13;
drainage system (including the road network) to the new rainfall data and to&#13;
sanitation functions.&#13;
Second step of the study&#13;
This stage will deal with the development of technical specifications for important works&#13;
and goods that were identified and retained during the first stage (with the exclusion of retention&#13;
basins and works linked to Beau Fraisier collector whose financing is included in tnis project but&#13;
is going to be studied separately).&#13;
The management of the above two sections of this Study will be entrusted to the&#13;
Directorate of Hydraulics of the Wilaya of Algiers. Directorate of Hydraulics will assume the&#13;
role of the contracting party with the consulting firm. This Directorate will be in charge of the&#13;
development of all tasks and assignments described in the Terms of Reference (Studies related to&#13;
seismic aspects are excluded from the Terms of References). The seismic part (i.e., micro-&#13;
zoning) will be elaborated on by the Construction Technical Control Agency (CTC) itself. This&#13;
will require an adequate coordination between the consulting firms and the CTC so that the&#13;
results of their works will be fully shared.&#13;
The first part will be entrusted to a consulting firm or to a consortium of firms upon an&#13;
International Shopping procedure from a limited list of consulting firms that expressed their&#13;
interest to participate.&#13;
A control committee will be convened under the Directorate of Hydraulics to ensure the&#13;
supervision of the Study. This committee will be comprised of representatives of the different&#13;
administrations concerned in this Study.&#13;
The second stage of the survey will follow the same procedure as the first.&#13;
Hydraulic works in the Basin of Oued Koriche.&#13;
The most important damage recorded during the November 10, 2001 flood occurred in&#13;
the basin of Oued Koriche.&#13;
This basin slope extends over an area of 1,180 ha and has about 7 km in length, and&#13;
discharges into Oued Koriche (Oued Ben Lezhar or Oued M'Kacel). Part of this basin is&#13;
inhabited. The hydraulic network of this Oued is composed of 5 channels situated on the left&#13;
bank. From upstream to downstream are connected to the following Oueds:&#13;
* Oued Beau Fraisier (covered by 950ml, 1.80 m by 1.20 m ovoidal collector);&#13;
* Oued Scottto (covered by a 700ml, 1.80 m over 1.20 m ovoidal collector);&#13;
* Oued Frais Vallon (covered by 100ml with a 1,000 mm dia collector);&#13;
* Oued Sidi Medjbar (covered by 3,000 ml with a 1,500 mm of dia collector); and&#13;
* Barranes Oued (covered by 1,400 ml with 1,250 mm dia collector).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
Another collector is located on the right bank of Oued Koriche which is 1.5 Km in length&#13;
(covered by a 1,400 ml with 1,250 mm dia collector).&#13;
The Oued Koriche (Oued Ben Lezhar or Oued M'Kacel) has an important collector of&#13;
variable dimensions of ovoidal sections that is 5 m large by 3.80 m height at downstream sill of&#13;
the central axis. A highway, "Chevalley-triolet road " was constructed above this collector. This&#13;
collector captures the waters discharged from the channels and a water main of 600 mm diameter&#13;
at the intersection of the highway.&#13;
Evaluations of the National Agency of Hydraulic Resources indicate that maximum&#13;
discharge per second during the flood of November 10, 2001 have reached 143 m3/s at the Scotto&#13;
footbridge and 730 m3/s at Triplet, contributing to a total of 2.6 millions/m3 and 0.8 millions/m3&#13;
of mud. This rainfall is estimated at 145 mm and its recurrence is every 90 years.&#13;
A significant loss of human lives has been recorded especially among the drivers of the&#13;
Chevalley-Triolet highway that got blocked. Significant damage has been caused to the&#13;
infrastructure, to private and public buildings, as well as to commercial activities (including&#13;
factories and business). On the hydraulic networks, there was a collapse of the collector that&#13;
ended up with a 20m-diameter opening, in addition to a nearly complete destruction of the 600&#13;
mm water main that feeds the collector through the basin of Oued Koriche.&#13;
Within the scope of this project, construction of flood retention basins (gabions) at the&#13;
junction of the different channels with Oued Koriche is planned in order to lessen the impact of&#13;
rising water. Their size will depend on the land available, the topography of the site, the nature of&#13;
the soil, and the level. of the discharge of the Oueds. The precise site, the number, the&#13;
measurements, as well as other features of these basins will be determined by the computer&#13;
simulation planned during the first phase of the Study Initially, it is expected that the project will&#13;
cover the construction of 10 basins with a common flood storage capacity of about 10,000 m3 (in&#13;
Baranes, Sidi Medjbar, Frais Vallon, Beau Fraisier, Scotto and Oued Koriche) and a new water&#13;
collector on the basin side of the Frais Vallon. Moreover, It is planned under this project, to build&#13;
a channel in the sub-basin of Oued Beau Fraisier and to recalibrate the downstream section of&#13;
Oued Beau Fraisier in order to improve the conditions of water out-flow in the sub-basin side.&#13;
The measurements of these channels will also be fixed by a computer simulation, which will be&#13;
undertaken by the "Study on vulnerability to natural hazards in the Wilaya of Algiers outside of&#13;
Bouzareah Massif"&#13;
The designs of the outlined works within the framework of this component will be&#13;
entrusted to a consulting firm or a consortium of firms in accordance with the procurement&#13;
procedures of the World Bank.&#13;
The rnanagement of the study and related civil works, as well as the technical designs,&#13;
will be entrusted to the Directorate of Hydraulics of the Wilaya of Algiers, which will be the&#13;
contracting party with a consulting firm, and contractors.&#13;
"The study on vulnerability to natural hazards in the Wilaya of Algiers outside of&#13;
Bouzareah Massif"&#13;
The objective of this Study is to identify, evaluate, and suggest solutions to the risks that&#13;
threaten certain zones in Algiers (at the exclusion of Bouzareah massif which will be dealt&#13;
separately). The risks to be treated within the framework of this Study relate to floods, mudflows,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
landslide, seismic vibrations, and pollution. The Study will propose preliminary solutions to&#13;
reduce these risks, to limit their impacts, and to rapidly rescue victims in case of disasters.&#13;
The following zones will be covered by this Study: zones of the Oued Hamiz to the East&#13;
of Algiers, Oued El Harrach, Oued Ouchaia, Oued Kniss, and the zone of landslides prone area of&#13;
Telemly situated in the heart of Algiers. These zones are known to be at high-risk.&#13;
The arrangement for managing this Study as well as related civil works is similar to the&#13;
one retained for the Irrigated Study on vulnerability reduction strategic of the Bouzareah Massif.&#13;
Torrential correction of the Oueds of the massif of Bouzareah&#13;
To limit the debits of the massif of Bouzareah stream, it is necessary to intervene on its&#13;
rivers (Oued Deux Moulins, Oued of the Zouaves, Oued Ravine Staura, Oued Sidi El Keibir,&#13;
Oued Le Plateau, Oued Beau-Sejours, Oued Baranes and Oued La Vigie, and others). The&#13;
proposed works in this project have the objectives of breaking the slope of the Oueds and of&#13;
reducing the water rate discharge and the quantities of mud thereof. These works requires the&#13;
installation of layers of gabions resting on the geo-textile in sections of the Oueds judiciously&#13;
chosen and in banks threatened by crumbling. It will also have conducted the clearing-out of the&#13;
mentioned beds of Oued and the restoration of their profile.&#13;
The management of this subcomponent will be entrusted to the General Directorate of&#13;
Forests- Forest Conservancy- of the Wilaya of Algiers. The studies and supervision of works will&#13;
be undertaken by a consulting firm to be recruited in accordance to the procurement procedures&#13;
of the World Bank. The works will be entrusted to enterprises upon Invitation for bids.&#13;
Plantation on basins side of Oued Koriche and its channels&#13;
In order to slow down the water discharge, to imprpve the water retention capacity of the&#13;
soil, and especially to consolidate the soil and limit the erosion, the forestation on the public land&#13;
and plantation of fruit trees on the private land will continue within the Project framework. These&#13;
plantings will essentially focus on the basin of the Oued Koriche. They extend over an area of&#13;
about 600 ha (Planting of forest trees over 360 ha and planting of fruit trees on 240 ha).&#13;
The Management of this subcomponent will be entrusted to the General Directorate of&#13;
the Forests - Conservancy of forests of the Wilaya of Algiers. The period of plantation depends&#13;
on the seasons.&#13;

ATTACHMENT 5: HOUSING&#13;
1. BANK FINANCING AND TARGET BENEFICIARIES&#13;
This sub-component finances the cost of construction of housing, housing-related&#13;
infrastructure and required technical studies for about 5,000 units of "logement locatif social" in&#13;
Algiers, for the people who need to be resettled off-site, because: (a) they were affected by the&#13;
Nov. 10, 2001 flood, or (b) they occupy hazardous sites within, or in the proximity of Bouzareah&#13;
Massif. The Government's regulations on social housing allocation (Executive Decree 98-42)&#13;
will be applied. The eligibility criteria for the Government's social housing program are those&#13;
with income lower than twice the amount of the national guaranteed minimum salary (16,000 DA&#13;
at the time of appraisal).&#13;
Right after the November 10, 2001 Flood, Wilaya of Alger has conducted a damage and&#13;
risk assessment. Twelve communes covering the stock of 106,886 housing units have been&#13;
affected by the flood (see Table A).&#13;

Most of these 5,000 households have already submitted applications for the government&#13;
social housing programs. The breakdown of beneficiaries per area is in Table 2. The other&#13;
households (with incomes higher than 2 SNMG) will be assisted through other available&#13;
government housing programs for which they are eligible such as "up-front grant" (AAP: Aide a&#13;
l'Accesion A la Propriete) and "Rent-to-Own" (Location-Vente) schemes.&#13;
The Wilaya of Algiers has identified seven potential sites, with estimated capacity to host&#13;
a total of about 6,200 dwelling units. The Wilaya's Environment Inspection Department&#13;
(Inspecteur de l'Environnement de la Wilaya d'Alger) and Construction Control Agency (Centre&#13;
Genie Sismique) conducted a rapid preliminary environmental review. This preliminary review&#13;
determined the seven sites as unencumbered, out of flood and landslide (glissement de terrain)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
zones, and considered suitable for housing. This will be confirmed by detailed environmental&#13;
studies during the early stage of the project implementation.&#13;
These seven sites are public land. Land will be granted for free according the&#13;
Governmental regulations regarding the land acquisition for social rental housing program.&#13;
Wilaya of Alger will ensure timely land acquisition.&#13;
2. OBJECTIVES AND SECTOR CONTEXT&#13;
The main objective of this sub-component is to respond to the pressing housing needs of&#13;
the low-income households victimized by the Nov.10 flood and those at risk of natural disasters&#13;
in the areas surrounding the Massif Bouzareah. These populations are at risk in case of future&#13;
natural disasters, particularly at risk of landslides. By fulfilling their housing needs, it aims at&#13;
reducing vulnerability to natural hazards.&#13;
This phenomenon of degraded illegal housing in environmentally hazardous area is a&#13;
reflection of urbanization and housing supply constraints.  According to the preliminary&#13;
assessment conducted by Wilaya d'Alger, out of 5,000 identified beneficiary households, 3,212&#13;
households are in degraded illegal housing (habitat precaire), most of which are located along the&#13;
slopes prone to landslides in Massif Bouzareah.&#13;
There are enormous supply constraints in Algeria and public production will not resolve&#13;
these problems over the long-term. The key outstanding issues in the housing sector include; (a)&#13;
continuation of the high level of Government's production of housing (80 percent in 1999-2001&#13;
period) - a level which inevitably inhibits private sector entry; (b) severe supply constraints in&#13;
land availability, infrastructure development, and iitling; and, (c) failure to initiate serious reform&#13;
of pricing and subsidies in the rental sector and in privatization of production and management.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

As a result, the levels of both direct financing of recurrent and capital expenditures and of&#13;
implicit subsidies remain high. Similarly, with the notable exception of housing finance -&#13;
competition, and the increased efficiency that inevitably ensues - is, largely absent from&#13;
production and management of the housing stock. Thus, the transformation of the housing sector&#13;
towards a market economy and the shift of subsidy policies from subsidizing supply to&#13;
subsidizing demand - remains to be more fully addressed.&#13;
The World Bank has collaborated with the Government of Algeria over the past ten years&#13;
in the housing sector. To address these supply and institutional and policy reforms, the Bank's&#13;
approach of collaboration with the Algerian Government in the housing sector has been to&#13;
support; (a) low-income housing programs (Resorption d'Habitat Precaire: on-going Low-Income&#13;
Housing Project); (b) transition to the market-based housing delivery systems through&#13;
development of housing mortgage finance programs (Housing Finance Project to be approved in&#13;
FY02); and (c) disaster rehabilitation and mitigation programs (on-going TEERP-Ain&#13;
Temouchent Project).&#13;
This sub-component being designed as an emergency operation, it will not be tied to the&#13;
on-going dialogue between the Algerian authorities and the Bank on the sector reform. Rather,&#13;
for this sub-component, choice of social housing as an instrument to respond to the beneficiaries'&#13;
housing needs will be dealt as an exception in consideration of its emergency nature of&#13;
operations. However, to ensure the achievement of the sub-component objectives (the overall&#13;
vulnerability reduction and improvement of living conditions of the beneficiary population), the&#13;
sub-component is designed to be maintaining integrity with other sub-components on&#13;
rehabilitation and disaster mitigation. For example, integrated studies on vulnerability proposed&#13;
in Component I will facilitate the finalization of locations prone to natural disasters and thus the&#13;
decision on the households required to be resettled.&#13;
3. LESSONS FROM OTHER PROJECTS REFLECTED IN THE DESIGN&#13;
The Bank is neither new in natural disaster rehabilitation operations nor housing sector in&#13;
Algeria. Experiences from these projects emphasizes the following:&#13;
Importance of close inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination in ensuring timely&#13;
implementation of civil works; and,&#13;
Need for capacity enforcement to ensure close supervision of the projects' social and&#13;
environmental impacts.&#13;
In the current Algerian system, local-level investments including housing are managed&#13;
through deconcentrated sectors represented at the Wilaya level. For housing construction and&#13;
land development, it involves several agencies and sectors concurrently such as hydraulics&#13;
department, and electricity utility. For the acquisition of land, it involves communes and&#13;
Direction des Domains. Thus the coordination at the Wilaya level becomes important to ensure&#13;
timely implementation. The latter points tend to be neglected in the construction/infrastructure-&#13;
focused operations. However, when the operations are targeted to the poor, this becomes crucial.&#13;
In the design of this sub-component, interface of social and environmental aspects with the&#13;
project implementation schedule through preparation and implementation of Environmental&#13;
Management Plan and Resettlement Action Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
4.     DESCRIPTION OF IMPLEMENTATION AGENCIES&#13;
Following are the agencies involved in the implementation:&#13;
Housing Department of Wilaya of Alger (La Direction de Logement de la&#13;
Wilaya d'Alger). As a deconcentrated sector represented at the Wilaya level, this Department&#13;
oversees the housing programs of Wilaya under the general guidance of the Ministry of Habitat.&#13;
In this sub-component, it will provide overall supervision of the implementation. The Department&#13;
will also be responsible for ensuring transfer of land title for the use of social housing programs.&#13;
Following key dates and steps have been reviewed and agreed with the Algerian&#13;
authorities for implementation:&#13;
a) Preparation and planning of technical studies, selection of contractors (Aug.02-March.03:&#13;
8 months);&#13;
b) ToRs for social assessment and consultation (April 03-);&#13;
c) Launching procurement for construction/civil works (Feb.03-: Estimated construction&#13;
period is 16-18 months);&#13;
d) Initiating the process of land transfer (July-Aug. 02)&#13;
e) Preparation of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and publication of the beneficiary list&#13;
(Dec.04); and&#13;
f) Completion of construction and transfer of the population to new housing (by Feb.05)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ATTACHMENT 6: PROJECT COST, DISBURSEMENT AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
PROJECT COST&#13;
The proposed loan of about $88.45 million would be disbursed over 4 years. Loan&#13;
proceeds would be allocated as follows: (a) Works: Housing - 80 percent and other infrastructure&#13;
- 60 percent; (b) Goods - 100 percent foreign expenditures, 100 percent ex-works local&#13;
expenditures, and 70 percent other local expenditures; (c) Services - 76 percent of local&#13;
expenditures for services of consultants domiciled within the territory of the Borrower and 62%&#13;
of foreign expenditures for services of consultants not domiciled within the territory of the&#13;
Borrower; and (d) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for training aboard, and 80 percent for&#13;
training in local expenditure.&#13;
Withdrawals from the proceeds of the loan will be based on the traditional disbursement&#13;
methods of the Bank, using direct payments, requests for special commitments and&#13;
reimbursement applications, either fully documented or using Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
as per applicable procedures. As projected by Bank's standard disbursement profiles,&#13;
disbursements would be completed four months after project closure. Disbursements would be&#13;
made against standard Bank documentation.&#13;
SPECIAL ACCOUNT (SA)&#13;
To facilitate disbursement of eligible expenditures for goods and services the borrower&#13;
will open and maintain a special account at the Banque d'Algerie (the Central Bank) to cover&#13;
eligible project expenditures to be managed and administered by the Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(CCSP). Authorized allocation of the special account would be US$ 3,000,000 covering an&#13;
estimated 4 months of eligible expenditures financed by the loan. The CCSP will be responsible&#13;
for submitting through Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD) monthly replenishment&#13;
applications with appropriate supporting documentation for expenditures incurred and will retain&#13;
and make the documents available for review by Bank supervision missions and project auditors.&#13;
To the extent possible, all eligible project expenditures should be paid through the special&#13;
account. Specifically all eligible project expenditures of less than US$ 50,000 equivalent shall be&#13;
paid from the SA. The Special Account will be replenished through the submission of&#13;
Withdrawal Applications on a monthly basis and will include reconciled bank statements and&#13;
other documents as may be required.&#13;
USE OF STATEMENT OF EXPENDITURE (SOES)&#13;
The Bank may require withdrawals from the Loan Account to be made on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for expenditures under: (a) goods under contracts costing less&#13;
than $ 250,000 equivalent; and (b) works under contracts costing less than $ 500,000 (c) services&#13;
of consulting firms costing less than $ 100,000 equivalent per contract, (d) services provided by&#13;
individual consultants costing less than $ 50,000 per contract, all under such terms and conditions&#13;
as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. All disbursements will be subject to the&#13;
conditions of the Loan Agreement and the procedures defined in the Disbursement Letter.&#13;
RETROACTIVE FINANCING&#13;
Retroactive financing of up to $3 million would be applied to expenditures incurred after&#13;
June 1, 2002, for consultant services, reforestation and other urgent works. Consultant services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
03&#13;
are required to commence detailed designs, and some flood protection works and forestation&#13;
require to be commenced before the next rainy season. Specifically, the contracts to be financed&#13;
retroactively include: EPW2.04 and EPW2.05 (Gabion construction); EPW2.07 and EPW2.08&#13;
(Forestation); EPW2.14 (Miscellaneous consulting services); PM3.04 and PM3.06 (Equipment&#13;
and Vehicles for Project Management).&#13;
INFORMATION FLOW&#13;
Homogenization and harmonization will be sought after as much as possible in areas such&#13;
as the methods and accounting presentations, the follow-up financial reports, (so as to be in&#13;
accordance with the models of the IBRD), and the software relative to the financial management&#13;
of the project (follow-up procedures, evaluation, and Audit.). Therefore, the flux of documents&#13;
will be undertaken in the following way:&#13;
(a)    The PCU will transmit the original of the relevant receipts to the BAD for&#13;
payment of operations and will keep a copy of the transmitted documents;&#13;
(b)    The BAD will update the description form of the operation. It will keep the&#13;
original of the documents and files as well as the debit statements issued by&#13;
the Bank of Algeria or the World Bank. It will make a copy of the accounting&#13;
situation of the special account to send as well as that of the loan account to&#13;
PCU and DGRFE, and to the World Bank. Otherwise, a copy of this&#13;
accounting will be transmitted monthly to the DGRFE; and&#13;
(c)    The Bank of Algeria will transmit, to the BAD, a monthly summary of the special&#13;
account even though no operation has been done during the considered month.&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
Four government agencies are involved in the project: The Wilaya of Algiers, ONM,&#13;
DGPC, and DGPC). The Wilaya of Algiers is the implementing agency of the project and will&#13;
establish Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to facilitate the implementation. The financial&#13;
management functions on the project will be divided between the PCU and BAD (Banque&#13;
Algerienne de Developpement). The PCU will be responsible for the project accounting and&#13;
reporting functions including: booking accounting transactions, record keeping, verification of&#13;
supporting documents, preparing bank reconciliation, preparing periodic reports and financial&#13;
statements, as well as monitoring the Special Account (established at the Central Bank of&#13;
Algeria). While, BAD will be responsible for the administration of the Special Account. BAD&#13;
will issue payment orders (withdrawn on the Special Account in the Central Bank) after&#13;
verification of the supporting documents received along the payment vouchers received from the&#13;
PCU. BAD will keep track of transactions incurred on the Special Account and prepare&#13;
Withdrawal Application to replenish the Special Account.&#13;
The financial management assessment conducted for the involved agencies revealed that&#13;
the financial management systems in place are adequate and meet the Bank minimum&#13;
requirements except for the generation of project's required reports. It is expected that at the&#13;
implementing agency (Wilaya of Algiers) it needs six months to upgrade the accounting and&#13;
reporting to generate the required reports. Meanwhile, the PCU will develop computer&#13;
spreadsheets to facilitate preparation of the reports. A qualified consultant will be appointed to&#13;
upgrade the accounting and reporting system and prepare Project Implementation Manual (PIM).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64&#13;
The financial management and payment procedures as well as procurement procedures will be&#13;
covered in the PIM.&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) will be prepared for the project on quarterly basis&#13;
within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The set of FMRs will include: summary progress&#13;
report on project implementation, cost per component for the quarter and cumulative, costs&#13;
incurred per expenditures type, project balance sheet, and procurements incurred on contracts&#13;
below the stated threshold.&#13;
The PCU will prepare annual project financial statements (project balance sheet, Special&#13;
Account statement, and cash flow) and arrange with the Bank for their auditing in accordance&#13;
with International Standards on Auditing by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and&#13;
under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The audited financial statements along with the&#13;
auditor's opinion will be sent to the Bank within six months of year-end.&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTS&#13;
The PCU will ensure the overall accounting and bookkeeping for the specific accounts of&#13;
the Project, the development of financial statements of the Project, and the Quarterly Reports.&#13;
The main rules of reporting are the following:&#13;
a)     Commitments: the Financial Management Specialist of the Project will post them.&#13;
The database of the BAD will be reinforced by the recording of information on all the&#13;
contracts and the contractors (amount, implementation deadline, procurement methods,&#13;
contact information, reference of the approvals, percentage of financing, method of payment,&#13;
etc.). At this level, the BAD will ensure the introduction of the codes reflecting the budgetary&#13;
subdivision, the category, the component, and cost assignment. These codes are essential to&#13;
ensure the development of the Financial Statement and Project Management Report (PMR) as&#13;
well as any other report to be presented to the head of the PCU as part of the monitoring and&#13;
decision-making processes.&#13;
b)     Disbursement forecasts: The data on payment estimates will be introduced in the&#13;
database by the implementation agencies based on the information on the signed contracts&#13;
registered in the initial plans against the information on the actual payments. This data will be&#13;
updated whenever possible to record any change that would have an impact on the planning.&#13;
The changes will be submitted for the preliminary agreement to the Director of PCU before&#13;
entering them in the database.&#13;
c)    Invoice checkin2 and effecting Dayments: Upon receipt of the invoices, the BAD&#13;
will enter the amount and the date into the systems of the concerned party's file to reflect in&#13;
the use of funds.  Upon approval of the payment and the submission of the Order of&#13;
Payment", the date of issuance of the order of payment will be seized by the PCU and added&#13;
to the database.&#13;
d)     Payments: upon receipt of the monthly balance sheet issued by the BAD, the&#13;
implementation agencies will ensure the entry of the executed payments as well as their value&#13;
dates in the file of the concerned third party in order to reflect the use of funds. It will also&#13;
introduce all amounts relative to the replenishing of the special account and payments upon&#13;
presentation of statements of expenditures linked to the sources of funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65&#13;
e)     Account Reconciliation: The system to be installed will determine the available&#13;
balance in an automatic manner. The implementation agencies will ensure a monthly&#13;
reconciliation between the accounting and financial balance and will submit it to the approval&#13;
of the head of the PCU. Any discrepancy will lead to a specific control in the form of an&#13;
adjustment of the accounts or claims addressed to the BAD for adjustment. The state of final&#13;
reconciliation will be submitted for the approval of the PCU.&#13;
f)     Proiect Management Reports: At the end of every quarter, the PCU will publish&#13;
the Financial Management Reports in accordance with the samples communicated by the&#13;
IBRD. This final report, duly approved, will be transmitted to the World Bank within the 45&#13;
days that follow the end of each quarter. This report will indicate the following:&#13;
(i) The source and use of fund;&#13;
(ii) Procurement Report;&#13;
(iii) Analysis of the commitments and payments by component;&#13;
(iv) Analysis of the commitments by category; and,&#13;
(v) Analysis of % of works completed and payments made by contract, with indication&#13;
of the percentages of advancement and the discrepancies.&#13;
The different analyses will reflect the actual status quarterly and annually since the&#13;
beginning of the Project. The estimates will be indicated and will be accompanied by the&#13;
registered gaps pertaining to the performance along with any rationale of these gaps.&#13;
g)     Proiect Financial Statements: These financial statements will include the&#13;
following:&#13;
(i) Sources and use of funds by component;&#13;
(ii) Analysis of the commitments and payments by contract and category;&#13;
(iii) Analysis of the commitments and payments by category of expenditure and type&#13;
of payment (budget, special account, statements of expenditure, direct payment);&#13;
(iv) A statement of reconciliation of the special account; and,&#13;
(v) A statement of reconciliation of the Loan.&#13;
The analyses will show the existing transactions of the fiscal year in question as well as&#13;
those in the previous fiscal years and the aggregates at the closing date. The approved Financial&#13;
Statement will be submitted to the Auditors within reasonable delays allowing them to perform&#13;
their audit and to transmit their annual report in a timely manner, six months at the latest after the&#13;
fiscal year.&#13;
h)     Audit Report: The analysis of the Financial Statements by an Auditor will lead to the&#13;
preparation of an audit report which will comprise the following:&#13;
(i) The audited Financial Statements;&#13;
(ii) A professional justified opinion on the Financial Statements, the special account&#13;
and the statements of expenditure. (The opinion must be in conformity with the&#13;
generally accepted standards);&#13;
(iii) Any irregularity having a significant impact on the accounts, the special account&#13;
or the statements of expenditures, and;&#13;
(iv)Any useful commentary presented in the form of notes to the Financial&#13;
Statements for a better understanding of the financial situation of the Project, by&#13;
reference to the principle of good information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66&#13;
The Auditor will ascertain the examination of internal control arrangements and will&#13;
indicate in a letter ("Management Letter"), any relevant weakness, the risk thereof, a reasonable&#13;
recommendation to solve the issue, as well as the commentaries of the concerned Authorities. The&#13;
Auditor will attempt to finalize his works, issue the audit report, as well as the letter of internal&#13;
checking and will transmit them on time to the World Bank.&#13;
The specific terms of reference will be issued by the Bank and transmitted to the Auditor&#13;
upon effectiveness of the Loan.&#13;
