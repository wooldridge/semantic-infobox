&#13;
                                      very important contribution towards solving this problem in&#13;
&#13;
                                      the long run.     There are two points I vmuld like to comment on&#13;
&#13;
                                                  First, I have some concern about the stabilization&#13;
&#13;
                                      program of the Government.     Nhile the Government and the&#13;
&#13;
                                      state enterprises experience a very large deficit in the&#13;
&#13;
                                       last fiscal year, the current budget is expected to show a&#13;
&#13;
                                       surplus.   This surplus is to be obtained by drastic reductions&#13;
&#13;
                                       in expenditures and sharp increases in receipts, boe1 to be&#13;
&#13;
                                       accomplished in a single fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
                                                  I vmnder to \Â·lhat extent this fast stabilization&#13;
&#13;
                                       program may substantially reduce the activities of the public&#13;
&#13;
                                       sector and affect the development of the economy, which is&#13;
&#13;
                                       in need of expansion.&#13;
&#13;
                                                  Second, I would like to comment on tl1e short-run&#13;
&#13;
                                       needs of manpov1er in this country.   I have some concern about&#13;
&#13;
                                       three facts:&#13;
&#13;
                                                  {a)   The economy is heavily dependent on expatriate&#13;
&#13;
                                       management and skills.&#13;
&#13;
                                 II&#13;
                                 'I&#13;
                                                  (b)   This expatriate manpower has very high cost&#13;
                                 II&#13;
                                 II    and tends to promote capital-intensive techniques.&#13;
                                 II&#13;
                                                  (c)   The departure of a large number of expatriate&#13;
                                 II&#13;
                                 I     personnel may occur at any moment, as was the case in 1970.&#13;

                                                     Perhaps Hr. Chaufournier, would come to the table&#13;

                                           and respond to the first question, and I will ask Hr.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Nunthali to comment on the second.&#13;
&#13;
                                                     Roger, you might start by estimating the total&#13;
&#13;
                                           amount of the arrears plus deficit in relation to the budget.&#13;
&#13;
                                           IÂ·1Y recollection is 125 percent of the budget.&#13;
&#13;
                                                     Secondly, will not the stabilization program resulti g&#13;
&#13;
                                           in as drastic a reduction in expenditures as it contemplates&#13;

                                   '       adversely affect development?&#13;

                                                     ~R.   CHAUFOUlli~IER:     Yes, sir.   I think your recollect on&#13;

                                           is correct, i~rms of the order of magnitude.            The problem&#13;
                                   II&#13;

                                           question was not whether a stabilization program would affect&#13;
&#13;
                                           development, but whether continuation of the present trends&#13;
&#13;
                                           would not lead to absolute bankruptcy.          It was so acute as&#13;

                                           the current trend was for an increasing deficit again on&#13;

                                           current account.   And the Central African Republic Government&#13;
&#13;
                                           didn't have any way in \'lhich it could meet its current&#13;

                                           was because it was really on ti1e brink of bankruptcy because&#13;

                                           as extremely important and urgent for the Central African&#13;

                                           the Central African Republic to provide recurrent expenditures&#13;

                                           for this project and for other projects as well.    And it&#13;

                                           could only have done it at the cost of increasing its&#13;

                                                 He therefore, although we still have some concern&#13;
&#13;
                                       that the program will encounter some difficulties, we felt&#13;

                                  I,   that ti1ere was enough evidence of seriousness of effort to&#13;

                                       justify going ahead and enough confidence that resources&#13;
&#13;
                                        7ould be available for this project to go ahead as well as&#13;

&#13;
                                       this is a situation that we will have to watch very closely&#13;
                                   I&#13;
                                       and the program perhaps will have to be adjusted as we go.&#13;

&#13;
                                       we gave careful consideration to whether we should defer the&#13;

                                       the fundamental needs of that country, and the President has&#13;
&#13;
                                       given such clear assurances that he vlill act to begin to meet&#13;
&#13;
                                       this serious financial problem that we felt justified in&#13;

&#13;
                                       departure of a large number of expatriate technical personnel.         i&#13;

&#13;
                                                 But go ahead with the basic question, then, should&#13;

&#13;
                                       to mount crash programs, training programs.           I believe the&#13;
&#13;
                                       country requires in the project itself, of course, there is&#13;
&#13;
                                       provision for the improvement of the technical institution.&#13;
&#13;
                                       At the moment we haven't -- perhaps I could ask my colleagues&#13;
&#13;
                                       in the Education Department, tl1e Education Projects Department,&#13;

                                       to thrmv some light on this one.&#13;
&#13;
                                  I,             As far as I know at the moment, we don't have any&#13;
                                  il&#13;
                                       definite projects worked out in that area.        But I agree that&#13;
&#13;
                                       that is one of the urgent requirements of the Government in&#13;

                                       view of its very acute shortage of manpower.&#13;

                                                 But the project itself is beginning on this.           And&#13;
&#13;
                                       other point I might make is that this is not -- r..ve are not&#13;

&#13;
                                        comments on this problem which is unfortunately not limited&#13;

&#13;
                                                  We have been quite concerned about the problem of&#13;
&#13;
                                        training, particularly of training project managers at&#13;
&#13;
                                        various levels of technical experience.          And we have reviewed&#13;
&#13;
                                        this problem recently.          I could give you some elements of&#13;
&#13;
                                        our thinking about it.          We are in the process of trying to&#13;
&#13;
                                        make an inventory of the needs for training because our&#13;
&#13;
                                        observation has been that it is quite often too late at the&#13;
&#13;
                                        time of an appraisal mission that we observe that there are&#13;
&#13;
                                I&#13;
                                Ji&#13;
                                        needs for skilled people who are not available in the country&#13;
&#13;
                                    I and therefore we have to have recourse to expatriates.              And&#13;
&#13;
                                        we have been thinking of trying to start the process a little&#13;
&#13;
                                        earlier to try to identify these needs as early as possible&#13;
&#13;
                                        so tl1at through various ways we could organize some training&#13;
&#13;
                                        of local people who would then be available when the project&#13;

                                        is ready to go.       And we are in the process of making a first&#13;

                                        support to this project.        As you just pointed out, this is a&#13;
&#13;
                                       very serious problem.          Although the amount of IDA money is&#13;

                                                  The C.A.R. is a very poor country.         Its population isi&#13;
&#13;
                                       small in number, only about 1.6 in the year 1970.         Qualitative!~&#13;
                                       they lack skilled labor.         The shortage of trained manpower&#13;
&#13;
                                       is the fundamental obstacle to development in all sectors.&#13;
&#13;
                                       C.A.R. is heavily dependent on expatriate personnel in both            I&#13;

                                              DR. CHEN: Thanks to the IMF Mission sent to CAR last&#13;
  11:30 - 12:13&#13;
                                    year, these efforts coupled with the Bank cooperation and&#13;
&#13;
                                    government approval, the stabilization program is now being&#13;
&#13;
                                    worked out.   There again I share the same concern whether the&#13;
&#13;
                                    government is really in a position to do it, but Mr. Chau-&#13;
&#13;
                                    fournier's explanation has met the question we have in mind.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Therefore I hope the CAR position will be approved.&#13;
&#13;
                                              Finally, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make one observa-&#13;
&#13;
                                    tion.   As to basic data, although the external debt service&#13;
&#13;
                                    in 1969--which by the way seems to be a little outdated--&#13;
&#13;
                                    in the year   1969 ~   ~t~as   only $2.3 million, which is insig-&#13;
&#13;
                                    nificant by any standard, and the debt service ratio was&#13;
&#13;
                                    3.9 percent of exported goods and services. However, CAR&#13;
&#13;
                                    is heavily dependent on export of three commodities; namely,&#13;
&#13;
                                    diamonds, cotton, and coffee.        I have two questions in this&#13;
&#13;
                                    connection.&#13;
&#13;
                                               ~irst   is whether there are any other natural&#13;
&#13;
                                    resources which yet can be tapped; second, if so, what is our&#13;
&#13;
                                    Bank's lending strategy in the future?        Are we planning to&#13;

                                    Â· help them to go into new fields and help them to diversify&#13;
&#13;
                                     their exports so they will be less dependent on the three&#13;
&#13;
                                     commodities I mentioned?&#13;
&#13;
                                               MR. McNAMARA: Mr. Munthali, would you answer that.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Are there other potential exports; and, if so, what are we&#13;

                                  in the agricultural sector, as well, aimed at improving the&#13;

                                  production of cotton, which is the single most important&#13;
                                  export crop of the country.&#13;

&#13;
                                  worried about the idea which I found endorsed in this report&#13;
                                  before us, that the expansion of primary school enrollment&#13;
&#13;
                                  should be restrained, while enrollment in secondary education&#13;
&#13;
                                  should increase. It is said in the report that expansion of&#13;
&#13;
                                  primary school enrollment should be limited to 3 percent per&#13;
&#13;
                                 _:year, and this report goes so far as to declare this policy&#13;
&#13;
                                  as being sound.&#13;
&#13;
                                             A second aspect commonly brought forward disfavor-&#13;
&#13;
                                  ing the value of primary education can be found nicely&#13;
&#13;
                                 Â· . phrased in the summary of discussions of the Board meeting&#13;
&#13;
                                 " dated March 28, where it is said that primary education&#13;
&#13;
                                  often had a lower priority in terms of enabling people to&#13;
&#13;
                                  meet the development needs of a country.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Mr. Chairman, I don't agree with both of these&#13;
&#13;
                                  aspects because I think they are humanly wrong against&#13;
&#13;
                                  widely accepted democratic principles and are economically&#13;
&#13;
                                   unjustified. I cannot imagine a policy endorsed by this Bank&#13;
&#13;
                                   which denies or limits education to the illiterates in favor&#13;

                                             Mr. Chairman, where are the reasons to believe that&#13;
&#13;
                                 a country with a small group of well-educated people and&#13;

&#13;
                                  is simply the foundation and start of everything, and how&#13;
&#13;
                                  much more costly will it be in the 80s and 90s, which most&#13;
&#13;
                                  of us will see, to catch up with what has been neglected now?&#13;

                                             Mr. Chairman, I can anticipate now some answere&#13;
&#13;
                                  to be given to these questions which concern me so much.&#13;
&#13;
                                  It's the government, the investment programs, the line taken&#13;
&#13;
                                  by the Bank so far, the immediate needs for highly trained&#13;

&#13;
                                  don't satisfy me as far as the Bank is concerned, because I&#13;

                                  believe the role of the Bank as being outward looking and as&#13;

                                              Mr. Chairman, I think human and economic progress&#13;

                                  cannot only be achieved, by _learning how, by giving technical&#13;

&#13;
                                 .appears to me as a sort of bias against primary education&#13;
&#13;
                                 .expressed in some documents before us.&#13;

                                              Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;

                                              MR. McNAMARA:      Duncan, would you come to the table.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Are we biased against primary education is the question,&#13;
&#13;
                                     and specifically   answe~t   in relation to this case. Should we&#13;
                                     not have given up the financing of additional secondary&#13;
                                 . education and financed more primary?&#13;
&#13;
                                               MR. BALLANTINE:     Mr.Chairman, may I say first that&#13;
&#13;
                                     I welcome Mr. Wolf's coming back to this question of primary&#13;
&#13;
                                     education because I share with him the view tha~n the long&#13;
&#13;
                                     run, the extension of an improved primary education or improve&#13;
&#13;
                                     basic education to all people in the developing countries is&#13;
&#13;
                                     an essential part of their development, so that on that point&#13;
&#13;
                                     of principle, there can be no disagreement whatsoever.&#13;
&#13;
                                               I think the question is a technical one, essentially,&#13;

                                 ' and it's how to allocate for the next ten years, resources&#13;

                                           MR. McNAMARA: Let's just stop there and emphasize&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                 the 75 to 77 and held the   ~econdary   at 4 or increased the 4&#13;
&#13;
                                 :to 5 and held the primary to 75?   It is that kind of&#13;
&#13;
                                 question quite frankly.&#13;
&#13;
                                           If you accept Duncan's first point that     the~e    are&#13;

                                 limited resources that should go to education, perhaps&#13;
&#13;
                                 we can discuss that later, but go ahead, Duncan.&#13;
&#13;
                                           MR. BALLANTINE:    Well, the second general point&#13;
&#13;
                                 is that, and I can't immediately put my eye on the statistics,&#13;
&#13;
                                 but I think it points out in the Appraisal Report, also the&#13;
&#13;
                                 President's Report that about 70 to 75 percent of the middle&#13;
&#13;
                                 level and particularly upper level, managers, directors, man-&#13;

                                 power of the country are expatriate.&#13;
&#13;
                                           MR. McNAMARA: That's the second point;      that's&#13;
&#13;
                                 paragraph 28 in the President's Report.      Seventy-five percent&#13;
&#13;
                                 of the professional personnel are expatriates.&#13;
&#13;
                                            MR. BALLANTINE: The third point is that we feel&#13;
&#13;
                                 that what we've got to do in helping a country to shape and&#13;

&#13;
                                     any manpower esttmates we could       get~   they were already enrolle&#13;

                                     Chairman pointed out this morning, there is about a 13 percent&#13;

                                     we felt definitely that the balance should be shifted, and&#13;
&#13;
                                     thatsttention should be given, so that what we are doing&#13;

                                                  MR. McNAMARA: I think that we just have to say, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wolf, that some countries in the world are building up to an&#13;
&#13;
                                     absolutely explosive situation in education. I recall in&#13;
                                     Zambia, for example, at the time of independence, it was&#13;
&#13;
                                     alleged to have 100 college graduates and 1000 high school&#13;
&#13;
                                     graduates in the entire country.        You just can't run a&#13;
                                                                                        -\-\,..e..    â&#128;¢&#13;
                                     country that way. You can't run Ethiopia in._ Twenty-f1rst&#13;

&#13;
                                     exposed to school.       This is raising very deep questions in our&#13;
&#13;
                                     minds.     As I told you a few weeks ago, I am going to a meetin&#13;

                                              The first question is, what should be the allocation&#13;

&#13;
                                 to the first, how should you allocate            th~t   between primary&#13;

                                 secondary, we feel rather confident, with 75 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
                                 professionals expatriates, we feel rather confident that you n ed&#13;
&#13;
                                 more secondary education, more than you need more primary.&#13;
&#13;
                                               In the case of Ethiopia, we feel absolutely sure&#13;
&#13;

                                 serious problems we have in this Bank, dealing with this&#13;
&#13;
                                 educational problem.&#13;
                                           Mr. Ohman.&#13;
                                           MR. OHMAN :   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The Central African Republic is among the least&#13;
&#13;
                                 developed of the developing countries. It is a landlocked&#13;
&#13;
                                 country, and indeed a very poor country. We think the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                                 Group has a special responsibility for these types of countries&#13;
&#13;
                                 and should endeavor to have a flexible and generous attitude&#13;
&#13;
                                 toward them.&#13;
&#13;
                                           We think that the project is well conceived with&#13;
&#13;
                                 a suitable concentration on the parts of the educational secto&#13;
&#13;
                                 which can contribute in the   most~aningful   way to development&#13;
&#13;
                                 of the country.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Now, unfortunately, I have to deal for just a little&#13;
                                 wbile with the preference question.   We have been informed that&#13;
                                 for bid evaluation purposes, tariff preferences accorded to&#13;
&#13;
                                 certain industrialized -countries might be taken into account.&#13;
&#13;
                                 We have been told informally that the amounts involved seem&#13;
&#13;
                                  to be relatively small and that the possible extra costs in&#13;
&#13;
                                  foreign currency resulting from the application of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
                                  formula might therefore not be very big.   Incidentally, I wonde&#13;

                                                I would like to make a general reference to state-&#13;
                                      ments made by us when we discussed recently projects for the&#13;
&#13;
                                      Congo and for Tunisia.     We then said that there was serious&#13;
&#13;
                                 Â· opposition within our parish to the application by the Bank&#13;

                                 Â·- of a formula for evaluation of bids that takes into account&#13;
&#13;
                                 ~ existing    tariff preferences, in certain industrialized&#13;
&#13;
                                      countries. This of course, this opposition still remains.&#13;
&#13;
                                                If I refrain from asking to be recorded        a~ain    as&#13;

                                      be construed in any way as meaning acceptance of the formula.&#13;
&#13;
                                      It is just that it seems unnecessary to repeat a number of&#13;
                                      times this opposition.&#13;
&#13;
                                                We   ~hink   it would be very useful for a number of&#13;
                                      reasons to have this matter discussed as soon as possible by&#13;
&#13;
                                      the Board, and we think     tha~   this might Â·well be Â· done even with ut&#13;
&#13;
                                      any lengthy in .depth study of past      perfo~ance.    After all,&#13;

                                      but they are hardly basieally of a typically technical nature,&#13;

                                      and a solution of the problems miqht not necessarily be made&#13;

                                 formula might entail, should also somehow be indicated to&#13;

                                 to the project itself, just to stress how valuable we think&#13;
&#13;
                                 the education project we are now discussing might be for&#13;
&#13;
                                 the Central African Republic. We don't want our appreciation&#13;
&#13;
                                 for the project in any way to be overshadowed by the comments&#13;
&#13;
                                 on the preferences, however important we think they might be.&#13;

&#13;
                                              Mr. Ohman made two or three observations and then a&#13;
&#13;
                                 suggestion with respect to the preferences. He said he though&#13;
&#13;
                                 it would be unwise to take a long period of time to examine&#13;
&#13;
                                 past history, and that I quite agree with him on.     If that&#13;
&#13;
                                 were what we are doing, we'd be wasting your time and ours,&#13;

                                 that we can complete the study in a lesser period of time.&#13;

&#13;
                                 discuss the preference issue without such a study, and&#13;

                                 .I'll simply say to the Board that any time a majority of the&#13;

                                  I will be quite happy to schedule it for discussion. I myself&#13;

&#13;
                                  on which I have seen the Board as split and as deeply divided&#13;
&#13;
                                  and when one approaches an issue that nations consider as&#13;
&#13;
                                  fundamental to their interests as apparently some consider&#13;
&#13;
                                  this, it seems to me we ought to examine it carefully in&#13;
&#13;
                                  advance, prepare such an analysis, distribute it to you, allow&#13;
&#13;
                                  reasonable time for you to study and then     thoa~htfully   conside&#13;

                                  it.   Otherwise, I simply fear we're going to split this&#13;
&#13;
                                  institution wide open and I don't think any of you wish that,&#13;

                                                      MR. WESTEBBE:   The amount of procurement involved&#13;
                                  .Â·&#13;
                                        is $510,000, of which 40 percent is exempt from custom&#13;
&#13;
                                        duties, by the nature of the equipment      bei~g   procured.    Under&#13;

                                        kinds of educational equipment are automatically exempt.&#13;
&#13;
                                        The balance of 60 percent, $330,000 approximately, is subject&#13;

                                                      So we are talking of something like $30,000 poten-&#13;

                                     in effect is normal.        Is this par for the course or is this&#13;
&#13;
                                     exceptional? Perhaps I had just missed it in other cases, and&#13;
&#13;
                                     it struck me on this occasion, because this is a country which&#13;

                                 t have no objection to that, but my question really is, is&#13;

                                 ~o   to.   There is one country in which we may be willing to go&#13;
&#13;
                                 t o 100 percent, but it's only for these countries that are as&#13;
                                 poor as this country is, as disadvantaged as it is, as someone&#13;

                                              Let me ask Mr. Cope to Â·comment upon the 20 percent&#13;

                                              MR. COPE: Mr. Chairman, practice differs quite a lot&#13;
&#13;
                                 from one country to another. In some cases, the government&#13;

                                  e duty free on some of the goods they need, so there's no&#13;

                                  there's very much point in my registering a reservation each&#13;

&#13;
                                  on the matter of this information about preferences.            I think&#13;

                                 Â·- I asked last week whether this could be provided as we go&#13;

&#13;
                                  hoped the information would be provided, whether asked for or&#13;
&#13;
                                  not orally, and I would ask now      whether that is your&#13;

                                  down, as you can guess, in this instance.&#13;

                                  on that last point. I was very glad to get at my request&#13;
&#13;
                                  the paper of April 1956.     I don't know whether the people&#13;
&#13;
                                  had the opportunity to read it, but I think the general&#13;
&#13;
                                  ruling was that we should stick to a ruling up to the moment&#13;
&#13;
                                  that we had an opportunity to change it; if we look at the&#13;
&#13;
                                  conclusions there, and it's a very good paper, by the way,&#13;
&#13;
                                  I think that that has been pointed out that this kind of thin&#13;
&#13;
                                  should only be done if the Bank is of the opinion that there&#13;
&#13;
                                  is indeed reason to put it forward.        In this specific case,&#13;

&#13;
                                      on this.   I do think, gentlemen, we're going to have to discip&#13;
&#13;
                                      line ourselves. We know we have got a problem here; we know we&#13;
&#13;
                                      have two groups of countries, one group in favor of a policy&#13;
&#13;
                                      we followed for 25 years, and another group opposed to it,&#13;
&#13;
                                      and you all sat in the same room I did and you heard each of&#13;
&#13;
                                      us express our views, and you saw that the Board was split&#13;
&#13;
                                      right down the middle.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 I don't know any issue in which we've been split&#13;
&#13;
                                      more evenly, depending upon how you evaluated the comments&#13;
&#13;
                                      of odor two Directors, you were split roughly 55-45 in favo         A&#13;
                                      of the present policy or 55-45 against it.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 Now, secondly, you all know how complicated this&#13;
 ''                                   matter is, and we haven't even begun to discuss the .complexit es&#13;

 \                                    andÂ· the views thatÂ· have been   eiprasse~   around this table so&#13;
&#13;
                                      far, but it's a very, very complicated matter.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 I think you have two choices.      You can either&#13;
&#13;
                                      ask us to schedule the subject for full debate, prior to the&#13;

                                       time that we complete a study or you can wait for a study.&#13;

                                      gotten $100 million under any policy, so the amounts involved&#13;

                                      are aegliglble. The importanceÂ· in"the short run is not&#13;

                                      ourselves accordingly.&#13;

                                                   Now this goes back to Mr. Rinnooy Kan's point.&#13;
&#13;
                                       I must say in principle I very much agree with him: in practic&#13;
&#13;
                                       I'm going to do the opposite.    It is simply because I think&#13;

                                 information (a) because of what Mr. Rinnooy Kan said; and&#13;
&#13;
                                ' (b) because the information is highly suspect.     It is just ve   ,&#13;
                                 very difficult to get hold of, and I am not certain of it, and&#13;
&#13;
                                 in no case am I certain that we are presenting to you all the&#13;
                                 facts in the case.&#13;
&#13;
                                              It probably throws some light on the problem.&#13;
&#13;
                                 In this particular case for example, we know enough about it&#13;
&#13;
                                 to knowâ&#128;¢ that it's de minimis, and I think if we know that,&#13;
&#13;
                                 probably that helps some of you, even though I don't feel&#13;
&#13;
                                 that we have presented fully the other side of the case this&#13;
&#13;
                                 morning.&#13;
                                                                      ~&#13;
&#13;
                                              But what I am really plJ&lt;aing for is understanding&#13;
&#13;
                                 here because this is an extremely serious problem that this&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bank faces, and it's the Bank, it's not any particular nation&#13;
                                 now that I am talking about.     It is this institution, and I&#13;
&#13;
                                 am urging you to recognize how deep the problem is on both&#13;
                                 sides of the issue and I am urging you to think about this&#13;
                                 institution. Now, having said all that, we will proceed as you&#13;
