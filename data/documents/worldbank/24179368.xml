&amp;#12; THE WORLD BANK/IFC ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM&#13;
 Memorialist: William Diamond&#13;
Date of Interview: July 17, 1986&#13;
Place of Interview: The World Bank, Washington, D.C.&#13;
Interviewer: Robert W. Oliver&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: This is Robert Oliver. I am about to have a conversation with Mr. William Diamond. It is&#13;
July 17, 1986.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    May I begin our conversation by asking you to say a bit about your background before the Bank,&#13;
how you came to the Bank in the first place, and then, perhaps, to talk about the highlights of your&#13;
experience in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DlAMOND: Yes, Mr. Oliver. I joined the Bank in August, 1947. Before that I had spent almost five&#13;
years in the U.S. Government and in UNRRA [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation&#13;
Administration], and that's the whole of my professional career before coming to the Bank. Before&#13;
that I was at The Johns Hopkins University, where I got received an A.B. degree in chemistry, switched&#13;
from that to history and won a Ph.D. in history. I had every intention of going back to research and&#13;
teaching in history after the aberration of the war. By aberration I mean I was diverted from what&#13;
would have been the normal course of events for me. Instead, I joined the U.S. Government in the&#13;
Board of Economic Warfare--later the Foreign Economic Administration-- immediately after getting&#13;
my degree. I worked first in Washington, very briefly in London, and then a year in Turkey. From&#13;
Turkey I transferred, still with the same organization, to Czechoslovakia. This was in September 1945.&#13;
I had an opportunity in Prague to join the UNRRA mission and did. It must have been in January&#13;
1946 that I left the U.S. Government, and I have never been in the U.S. Government since. After&#13;
about 8 months with UNRRA in Prague, I was transferred to London because the Soviet Chief of&#13;
Mission didn't like the "truths" which I was telling, and I didn't like his eliminating my truths. So I was&#13;
transferred to London. In January 1947 my work in London was finished. I suppose I could have&#13;
returned to UNRRA in New York, but I decided to call it quits. My wife and I went to Paris.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -2-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
     I worked in London for William Welk, who had been invited to join the staff of the World Bank. I&#13;
 was with him only about three months when he left London to come to Washington. Before be left, I&#13;
 told him I had heard of the World Bank and asked him, if he saw any opportunities for me, to let me&#13;
 know. I gave him the address at which I could be found in Paris where my wife and I had decided to&#13;
 spend six months while I wrote a book on Czechoslovakia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    While I was in Paris, in the Spring of 1947, 1 received a telegram from the Bank, signed, if I&#13;
remember correctly, by Stanley Hoar, who was then the head of what was ultimately called the Loan&#13;
Department. I am not sure what it was called at that particular moment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He invited me to come in as soon as I returned and join the Bank, and asked when I would return. I&#13;
told him we expected to come back that summer, which,in fact we did, in June. I went immediately to&#13;
see him, and I also saw Mike [Michael L.] Lejeune, who was then in a personnel officer under the&#13;
Personnel Manager Bill [William F.] Howell. I was accepted. However, I did not accept until first I&#13;
had gone to New York to look around the UN and had spoken to a few friends in the U.S. Government&#13;
about prospects there. But fairly quickly I decided to join the Bank, beginning August 11, 1947.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I'm afraid I can't tell you what factors I had in mind that led me to choose the Bank over&#13;
opportunities that might have existed in the UN, both of which were after all quite new, just getting&#13;
underway. But I did take the Bank and here I remained for 30 years, six months and three weeks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It never occurred to me that I would be in the Bank anywhere near that long. I thought of it for&#13;
years as an interim thing; I thought I would go back to academic life. As I mentioned to you the other&#13;
day, I had received from the Social Science Research Council a so-called Rehabilitation Grant, just&#13;
around the time I returned from Europe, thanks to the intervention of a former professor of mine at&#13;
Johns Hopkins, who was an official of the SSRC. The grant was to ease my return to academic life&#13;
because I was "a young man of promise whose career had been interrupted by the war." I accepted, but&#13;
asked for postponement for a year, then two years, and then three years. I think it was five years&#13;
altogether before I finally decided that I was kidding both the SSRC and myself. By that time, I&#13;
suppose, the simple fact wis that I was hooked on the Bank, so I stayed.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                             -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 OLIVER: Before I ask you to say more about your career in the late 1940s and 1950s in the Bank, let&#13;
 me ask about the year you lived in Turkey, because Turkey figured relatively prominently in your Bank&#13;
 career at one time or another. You said that you loved the year in Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 DLAMOND: Yes. While working for the Foreign Economic Administration [FEAJ, I went to Turkey&#13;
 first for a three-month period, in the Spring of 1944. This was a mission with my then supervisor. I&#13;
 had been involved in Turkish work in the FEA. By Turkish work in this case I mean economic warfare&#13;
and particularly preclusive buying operations. The moment came to look for ourselves and we went.&#13;
When I returned, I asked for the opportunity to work there, and I was chosen to go. I went in&#13;
September 1944 and stayed until September 1945.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The FEA mission in Turkey was an appendage of the State Department, or more specifically of&#13;
the Embassy in Ankara. It was not an appendage of the State Department here. Ambassador&#13;
Lawrence Steinhart was the big boss. In fact it was he who arranged for me to accompany him to&#13;
Czechoslovakia when he took over the Embassy in Czechoslovakia, a year later, in 1945.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you have occasion to travel rather extensively in Turkey during that time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIA-MOND: No, I did not. There wasn't a good reason to. I saw Istanbul, a good bit of it. Ankara&#13;
was headquarters and my home, but I saw and worked in Istanbul from time to time. I had a little bit&#13;
of experience in the Seyhan Valley, which ultimately became the site of the Seyhan Dam, the big cotton&#13;
growing and citrus area. And I visited Izmir, but that was strictly on holiday with the girl who later&#13;
became my wife. And, of course, I visited the area immediately surrounding Ankara. I developed a lot&#13;
of Turkish friendships which paid off in the long run. Paid off later on, even in my Bank career. And I&#13;
still have friends there, although a declining number are still alive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, having introduced the subject of Turkey, may I ask if you'd care at this point in the&#13;
interview just to say something about what you subsequently did in and for Turkey while you were in&#13;
the Bank?&#13;
&amp;#12; DLAMOND                                           -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Curiously enough, one of my first jobs in the Bank was to write an economic report on&#13;
Turkey, It was a desk study. Remember, I'm speaking of 1947. The Bank had not sent missions to&#13;
many countries. Turkey was not among them. Bill Welk, for whom I worked, asked me to prepare a&#13;
background paper on Turkey, which turned out to be a document about an inch thick: some history,&#13;
the background of the Republic leading up to the situation in wartime, basic economic facts about the&#13;
country, and the current political and economic situation as I knew it. That was the beginning. I&#13;
remained connected with Turkey as a junior and then a senior loan officer for a good many years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    During that period I participated in the first World Bank mission to Turkey under the direction of.&#13;
Stewart Mason, who was my supervisor at the time. One other person was on the mission, Harry&#13;
[E. Harrison] Clark, an economist, who did not stay with the Bank very long. He left within a few&#13;
years. The three of us tried to do the kind of job which a more respectably-sized mission of 10 or 15&#13;
does these days, maybe more competently than we did then. We produced--or Harry produced, but we&#13;
all had inputs--an economic report. We also produced what today would be called a strategy paper,&#13;
and we identified a group of projects for the first loans from the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Then, after those papers were discussed back here, I was deeply involved in the preparatory work&#13;
for those projects and in the appraisals. This included a silos project, because we thought agriculture&#13;
was very important, and grain storage in particular. Storage facilities were woefully lacking, which had a&#13;
lot of consequences. It included a ports project, encompassing the rehabilitation of Istanbul,&#13;
Iskenderun, Mersin, Izmir, and a few other ports, but mainly the Port of Istanbul. We touched on but&#13;
did not actually go into at that time--it came up seriously slightly later--the idea of a large multi-&#13;
purpose dam on the Seyhan River. We floated in the Bank the idea of what we then called an&#13;
"industrial development institute," for lack of a better word, some kind of an institution which would be&#13;
able to retail Bank resources to private enterprises. At the time, private enterprise was just beginning&#13;
to feel its oats in Turkey, for a variety of political as well as economic reasons. We went to Turkey with&#13;
no prior intention of coming up with something like this. It was a surprise to us, however, that we&#13;
received so many messages, calls, and appeals for assistance from private entrepreneurs and&#13;
industrialists.&#13;
&amp;#12;DLAMOND                                            -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: May I interrupt to ask, this is still 1947, this report that you're talking about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No, the beginning of 1949. I joined in 1947, and then almost immediately thereafter went&#13;
to Greece for a year. So it would have been January to March 1949, if my memory is correct.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: To the best of your recollection, was this the first time that somebody in the Bank had&#13;
begun to raise the question about the Bank's involvement in industry as distinct from major&#13;
infrastructure? Obviously, what you're telling me is going to lead to some discussion of development&#13;
banks, development finance institutions. It sounds to me like this was a very innovative idea.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, well, I think maybe it was, that is, the first time the Bank promoted an institution to&#13;
stimnulate industry. But there was a prior effort of a different kind, to achieve the same purpose. In&#13;
1950, I think it was, the Bank made a loan to Mexico for a consortium of private commercial banks, the&#13;
idea being that each one of them would put forth specific projects requiring medium and long-term&#13;
capital for its clients. If approved, foreign costs would be financed out of the Bank's loan. It didn't&#13;
work. I think that only about five percent of the money was actually disbursed; the rest was cancelled.&#13;
And a few years later, in 1956, the Bank made a loan to the Central Bank of Costa Rica, for use by&#13;
three nationalized commercial banks, state-owned commercial banks, to finance industry. That loan&#13;
did work; it was repeated one or two times.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In any event, these were different animals. In Turkey we were talking about the creation of a new&#13;
and permanent private institution, one which would have a role in Turkey quite aside from the&#13;
distribution of World Bank resources. It would be, if you will, a proto-term-lending bank cum proto-&#13;
investment bank. That was innovative. Simultaneously, as you may know, the Bank got to work on a&#13;
new state-owned institution in Ethiopia, which had a totally different kind of history.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Wel, may I infer that the management of the Bank was at that time struggling with the&#13;
constraint imposed by the Articles of Agreement that Bank loans, unless given directly to governments,&#13;
had to be guaranteed by the government of the country to which they were given?&#13;
&amp;#12; DLAMOND                                            -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes. And there was no possibility of getting government guarantees for what we hoped&#13;
would be hundreds and ultimately thousands of relatively small loans to individual entrepreneurs. The&#13;
thought was to create a central agency, a distributing point if you will, call it an institute or a bank, and&#13;
that the governrment would be willing to guarantee a Bank loan to it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But aside from this, we discovered pretty quickly that the industrialists and entrepreneurs&#13;
themselves didn't want a government guarantee for fear of what that would imply about government&#13;
oversight of their affairs. Moreover the Bank itself would have found it physically impossible to deal&#13;
with individual loans to so many relatively small private business enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, shortly thereafter there was the notion of having private development banks to which&#13;
the Bank could make loans through the government. Is this the time in the interview for you to talk&#13;
about the history of this evolution of Bank thinking, with which you had a major involvement?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, let's come back to that in a moment, because you asked me before about what&#13;
happened in Turkey, and I brought you roughly up to 1952.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The next big thing in which I was involved was the general survey mission in Turkey. You know&#13;
the history of the survey missions, the first one having been in Colombia under the direction of&#13;
Lauchlin Currie, and the next one was in Turkey. The Turkish -one didn't turn out very well for a&#13;
variety of reasons. I was not a member of the mission. But Dick [Richard H.] Demuth, who was in&#13;
charge of the overall activity with respect to survey missions, decided that the way to salvage what there&#13;
was, was to pull me out of my regular operational work, because of my Turkish background during the&#13;
war and in the Bank. He put me to work with Frances Henderson, an editorial assistant of his, and the&#13;
two of us wrote the survey report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We wrote and we edited. Needless to say, we then sent drafts for review by members of the&#13;
mission, but the document was not done by the mission. What we had was a collection of inputs. I&#13;
suppose what the mission lacked most of all was direction. The chief of mission was James Barker,&#13;
who was the head of Allstate Insurance Company, part of the Sears Roebuck empire. How he got&#13;
&amp;#12; DIA4MOND                                           -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
 into the act I don't recall, except I suspect it was a prior relationship with either [Robert L.] Garner or&#13;
 [Eugene R.] Black.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Now, one of the projects that we had tentatively identified before but which emerged in this report&#13;
 was the Seyhan Dam. I was the senior loan officer involved. It was my negotiation and my&#13;
presentation to the Board of Directors. It must have been in 1952, more or less, that that loan was&#13;
made. It must have been around at that time that what was the Loan Department was divided into&#13;
regional groupings. The person in charge of the area, which included Turkey, asked me to continue&#13;
working on Turkey. I was also given the opportunity of joining the Department of Operations - Asia&#13;
and Middle East. And I chose the Far East for no other reason than that I felt that I was reasonably&#13;
educated on the subject of Turkey and I feared being stuck with the label of a Turkish expert.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Before this reorganization of 1952 and after you came to the Bank in 1947, your official title&#13;
was loan officer?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Assistant Loan Officer, Eastern European Division, Loan Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes. And for Turkey specifically?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Mr. Oliver, I don't recall. I'd have to look. I have every one of my personnel sheets, so I&#13;
could identify that easily enough. I came into the Bank as an assistant loan officer at the salary of&#13;
$6,500 a year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Under Stanley Hoar?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes. But it was while I was in Greece on a year's leave, which I have mentioned to you,&#13;
just one month after I joined the Bank, [William A.] Iliff came from England in February 1948 to&#13;
become Director of the Loan Department. He became the big boss of loan operations, and when I got&#13;
back from Greece he authorized raising my salary to $7,200. Yes, I came in as a junior officer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: All right. Now you're about to move to the Asia theater.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                            -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 DIAMOND: Yes, for the reason I gave you. And in fact I became involved in Thailand. You know, I&#13;
 went to Thailand several times but was not on the first mission there. There had already been two or&#13;
 three missions to Thailand, which were led by Tony [Antonin] Basch, whose name you may recall. He&#13;
 was one of the early senior economists of the Bank. In that period the divisions weren't as neatly&#13;
 aligned geographically as they ultimately became or as they should have been. I found myself at one&#13;
 point in the years following 1952 in charge of a division which included Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Nigeria&#13;
 and Thailand. There was a certain degree of gerrymandering there I suppose, which would now be&#13;
 unacceptable. But the Bank wasn't as big then. The number of members was growing rapidly, and one&#13;
 explanation was that it was necessary to divide up the work fairly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      But, yes, Thailand, Ethiopia. I actually made my first visit to Ethiopia in September 1952. My first&#13;
 to Thailand was not until January 1953. During this period there was nothing going on in Yugoslavia&#13;
so that didn't keep me particularly busy. And in Nigeria the big thing was a general survey mission&#13;
headed by Ronnie [Aron) Broches. John Adler was the chief economist. In Ethiopia we got involved&#13;
in the creation of another financial institution but of a totally different kind. It was a reshaping of what&#13;
had been a very small and totally goverrnent-owned agricultural bank. To my recollection, no&#13;
question was ever raised in the Bank about the appropriateness of working with that state-owned&#13;
development bank. That was done before my first visit, in 1950 or 1951. When the Bank began to&#13;
promote and ftnance development banks, there did not exist the same kind of strong aversion to the&#13;
Bank's financing state-owned institutions that emerged later on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I imagine that one reason for the sharp, strong view that emerged in the Bank later on was the fact&#13;
that the Ethiopian development bank turned out to be a mess. And in those years the Turkish one&#13;
went reasonably well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Can you elaborate? Why was this so?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, I think the fundamental reason was the difference in the state of the Ethiopian and&#13;
Turkish economies at that time. I would argue today that Ethiopia wasn't ready for it. There weren't&#13;
projects of a type that the development bank could finance. There weren't entrepreneurs of the same&#13;
kind. There were comercial entrepreneurs in the market place but not proto-industrialists.&#13;
&amp;#12; DLAMOND                                             -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMONDI&#13;
      In Turkey at this time you had a burgeoning entrepreneurial community. You had an opening up&#13;
 of the economy to the private sector despite the fact that state enterprises remained extremely strong&#13;
 and still do. Perhaps the Turkish government would say today, regrettably so. But there was an&#13;
 opening with the political victory of the Democratic Party in the first post-war election. It defeated the&#13;
 Republican Peoples' Party--the old party of Ataturk. One important part of the platform of the&#13;
Democratic Party was loosening the constraints on private energies and organization. There were&#13;
accumulations of capital already, some made through normal business but others I guess in the way&#13;
which was common to a lot of Europe in the 19th century: government contracting. The entrepreneur&#13;
par excellence in Turkey, who is still alive and powerful, was Mr. Vehbi Koc. If memory serves,&#13;
Mr. Koc got his as a grocer in the 1920s, then became a contactor in the coal business, contractor for&#13;
the Government. And, of course, there were any number of ex-military officers who, when they left the&#13;
army, took advantage of their connections. Again, that was true in Europe in the 19th century. We&#13;
know, of course, that it is true in the latter part of the 20th century as well. In any event, there was a&#13;
big loosening up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    At the same time there was a big influx of foreign capital through the American aid program,&#13;
which at one point brought 50,000 tractors into the country. This led to a big increase in agricultural&#13;
production. Farmers had money. With the money they demanded something. There was a need for&#13;
textiles, processed foods, consumer goods of all kinds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I think the state of the economy was the principal difference. Ethiopia wasn't quite ready. Orvis&#13;
Schmidt was the man who masterminded for the World Bank the transformation of the small&#13;
Agricultural and Commercial Bank of Ethiopia into the Ethiopian Development Bank, which wasn't&#13;
much bigger. When I became an Assistant Director of Operations, Western Hemisphere in 1960, he&#13;
was the Director. He'd come from the Treasury. He'd had long experience in Latin America. He&#13;
headed the first mission to Ethiopia. He was   IJ.I Burke Knapp's deputy until Burke becameVice&#13;
President. Then he became Director of Operations, Western Hemisphere. Orvis was greatly&#13;
impressed with and knew well the Latin American fomentos. CORFO [Corporacion de Fomento de la&#13;
Produccionj was one of the spectacular ones, in Chile. These were state development banks, or state&#13;
development corporations. Their job was to "foment" development. He had the vision that a state&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
 development bank in Ethiopia would not simply be able to provide funds to those who came in the&#13;
 front door, but would also devise projects, if you will, and get them started. But, of course, there was a&#13;
 big difference between Ethiopia and Chile, or Ethiopia and Mexico where there was the National&#13;
 Financiera. I think by the early 1950s most of the Latin American countries had their state fomentos.&#13;
 The financieras came along a little bit later. They were primarily private institutions. Orvis was, in a&#13;
 sense, the founder of the Development Bank of Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In Turkey, as I said, it-was Stewart Mason, Harry Clark and myself who initiated the idea. The&#13;
 Bank got consultants to help us in Turkey and, later on, elsewhere. One was a man with a totally&#13;
different background from ours, Harold Johnson, a friend of Black's, a very able man. He had been in&#13;
the automobile business in Denver in the early days of automobiles, immediately after World War I.&#13;
He became rich and became a special partner of Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Bean, as it then&#13;
was. Harold was asked to go to Turkey to look into the feasibility of the institution we visualized and, if&#13;
he felt positively about it, to proceed to do something about it. And I accompanied him on both of his&#13;
trips to Turkey. His orientation was just totally different from Orvis', and hence the institution he&#13;
helped promote. But the main thing is that the environments were different.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, and part of the environment clearly was a lot of potential entrepreneurs who knew&#13;
what they were going to do when they got funded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, people. Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes, quite righf. What were the symptoms of the failures in Ethiopia? Were they that&#13;
enterprises failed or that the Government couldn't find people to start up projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, mind you, the Government didn't run this. The Government owned it. But, as&#13;
happened in those earlier days, more often than not, the Bank proposed someone to be the managing&#13;
director, general manager, and the Goverrnment accepted. In this case it was Leon Baranski. Does&#13;
that name ring a bell with you?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 DIAMOND: Leon Baranski was a fine man. He had been head of the central bank of Poland before&#13;
 World War II. I don't recall where he spent the war. I suspect in England. He was at Bretton Woods,&#13;
 I think. He became an early, maybe an original member of the Board of Directors. But he had to&#13;
 leave the Board of Directors after Poland withdrew, and he would not go back home. So the Bank&#13;
recomended him for this post. He was a very able man. He would have done much better, however, as&#13;
the head of the State Bank of Ethiopia than as head of the Development Bank of Ethiopia.&#13;
Contrary-wise, as they say, Jack Bennett, who had been chosen by the U.S. Treasury to be head of the&#13;
central bank, would have done a lot better as the head of a development bank. They were just in the&#13;
wrong roles. This was one thing: the nature of the management. And there were no trained people&#13;
for the staff. Above all, projects didn't come. I can't give you any figures at this point, but they were&#13;
very few and far between. The only thing that one might cal a promotion involved the establishment of&#13;
a program for financing the expansion of coffee growing in the Jimma area, which is one of the two or&#13;
three major coffee growing areas in Ethiopia. It is a hundred miles or so south of Addis Ababa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Baranski was fine as a person and as a banker, but not for that kind of institution. An Ethiopian&#13;
staff did not develop. There weren't people ready, willing and able to, either to create industrial&#13;
enterprises or even to accept them from somebody else; and they were without the required initial&#13;
equity capital as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: So I take it that the funds were available to Fmance things and nobody was available to use&#13;
them,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: Yes. Mind you, this institution was established with very little capital. As I recall, the&#13;
share capital was only $3 million, and part of that share capital was financed by the Bank loan, a most&#13;
unusual--maybe a unique--situation. The Bank loan was to the Government, and as it was drawn down&#13;
for specific projects, the Government was indebted to the Bank, but the counterpart was that the&#13;
Government increased its equity in the Development Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Wasn't it unusual throughout the history of Bank involvement with development banks for&#13;
outsiders, for non-nationals, so to speak, to be put in charge of the development bank?&#13;
&amp;#12; DLAMOND                                          -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  DIAMOND: No. Quite the contrary, and here I offer a pitch. We put a man in Turkey to start with,&#13;
 named Norman Tucker. He was the head of the Bank's, a small staff in New York. Why Black chose&#13;
 him, I do not know. One would not ordinarily have thought, in this period when you were trying to&#13;
 build up your marketing operation, to take out your chief marketer--I guess he was called Director of&#13;
Marketing. One would not have thought of putting him there. I suspected there was something going&#13;
on that I wasn't aware of. But the fact is, there he was. He became General Manager, but he died&#13;
within a year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     He made one immensely important contribution, and that was the selection of Bulent Yazici to be&#13;
his Assistant General Manager. For more than a year the Bank proposed foreigners to take Tucker's&#13;
place, but everybody for some reason or another was turned down. I remember very well at least one&#13;
of the people who was nominated and who went for an interview, with whom I remained friendly for&#13;
another 15 years. But the Turks always found reasons for turning them down. In the end the Bank&#13;
washed its hands of the matter and said, well, Yazici has been running this now as Deputy General&#13;
Manager for a long time and we have no objection to his becoming General Manager. He was very&#13;
able.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And he was Turkish, I take it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Turkish, yes. He had been an Inspector of Finance. He had been a Counsellor at the&#13;
Embassy in Washington in the last days of the war or immediately after the war. That's where I first&#13;
met him. He'd gone back to the Finance Ministry. He was a member of the steering committee which&#13;
was appointed to help create that bank. He left to join the development bank. He remained General&#13;
Manager for a long time. At a certain stage he became the General Manager of the It Bank, which is&#13;
the largest commercial bank in Turkey, and the largest shareholder of the Industrial Development&#13;
Bank. By tradition the General Manager of the 4^   Bank is the Chairman of the Board of the Industrial&#13;
Development Bank of Turkey. So suddenly Yazici became Chairman. Bulent had his problems. At a&#13;
certain point the Government really did try to move in--but that's a separate story--to take control of&#13;
the Bank. As I said, appointing Bulent was Tucker's big contribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   We insisted on and found a foreign General Manager for Liberia. We got a foreign General&#13;
Manager for the development banks in Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and India. I watched and I&#13;
&amp;#12; DLAMOND                                           -13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
worked with these people for many years, and I developed the conviction, which I have recorded in&#13;
several places, that you should not appoint a foreigner unless there is absolutely no alternative. It's&#13;
only the rarest of them that makes a go of it. Not because of lack of competence but because there are&#13;
so many other obstacles to success: not being part of the culture, not knowing how things work in the&#13;
country, not being able to develop quickly enough the right kind of relationships, both with the external&#13;
organizations with which he has to live, such as the government and the banks, and with his own staff&#13;
inside.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     A few of them did a very good job. One who would have given you a terrific interview were he still&#13;
alive, who died only two years ago, was Dutch. Eago Kuiper had been the head of the Industrial Bank&#13;
of Indonesia. I don't recall how the Bank found him. He worked as our consultant in several&#13;
countries, and he became the first head of the development bank in Malaysia. He did a very good job.&#13;
He subsequently represented the IFC on the Boards of several development banks. He was an&#13;
exception. By and large the experience was not great; maybe it could have been better. By the way,&#13;
George Woods also insisted on a foreign manager in the Philippines. The Bank named a very able&#13;
American connected with Chase Manhattan, so he was probably identified by Black. But he didn't&#13;
work out. Perhaps the chemistry wasn't right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    George Woods was also involved in promoting the development banks in India and Pakistan.&#13;
There was a second George involved in the Philippines as well: George Wishart. As I said, the&#13;
Philippine appointment didn't work; and I had the nasty duty, the difficult duty, a few years later, of&#13;
making the recommendation that it was time to get him out even though his contract wasn't up yet. He&#13;
did go and he was replaced by a Filipino who had 15 good years, until things changed in the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: In general, the Bank had a fair amount of control over the Board of Directors. Not only the&#13;
top Director, President or the Manager, whichever he might have been called, but the whole Board of&#13;
Directors in the development banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: No, not at all, Mr. Oliver. The Bank was not represented on any Board of Directors.&#13;
First of all, the Bank never held any equity.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 OLIVER: Well, but I meant it had a hand in selecting the people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 DLAMOND: No. The Bank always insisted that the first Board of Directors be satisfactory to us&#13;
 before the Bank made a loan. And so we took a careful look at the proposed Board. But it would&#13;
 have been going a little too far, I think, and I guess the Bank thought, to say that any change in the&#13;
 Board of Directors brought about by the shareholders--they are the ones who elected the&#13;
 Directors--would have to come to us for prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      There was one curious situation in Turkey. I told you that at a certain point the Government tried&#13;
 to take overt control. This was the Government of Adnan Menderes who was elected on the&#13;
 Democratic Party platform of free enterprise. You may recall that Menderes and his Ministers of&#13;
 Foreign Affairs and of Finance were ultimately hanged after the coup of 1962, when the military took&#13;
over. A lot of people were arrested; all of the others were ultimately released, but these three were&#13;
hanged. Incidentally that Foreign Minister, you'll find a fair amount about him in Garner's book.&#13;
Garner calls him the only truly evil man he has ever met. He called him a monster. His name was&#13;
[Fatin] Zorlu.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It sounds like he should have been hanged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: Garner said that he's the only one who deserved it. On the other hand, Garner thought&#13;
the Finance Minister, whom I also knew quite well, Hasan Polatkan, was innocent, was trapped, and&#13;
what he should have had was a whipping rather than a hanging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    At a certain point Menderes, who developed delusions of grandeur as time went on and an&#13;
imperial prime ministership complex, tried to pack the IDB Board, and there was a great deal of to do&#13;
about it, but there was a limit to what could be done. The Bank was very distressed. Then, for the first&#13;
and to my knowledge the only time, Black asked, not that it appoint a representative on the Board, but&#13;
that it suggest somebody to be named by the shareholders in whom we had complete confidence so he&#13;
could write to us privately if we so wished. An homme de confiance. This was done. It was one of my&#13;
wartime friends, as it happened, one of the people with whom I had developed a friendship, Hazim&#13;
Atif Kuyucak. He had a an excellent reputation, both as professor of economics at the American&#13;
University and more importantly as the most eminent lawyer in the country at that time. During the&#13;
war he was also a Member of Parliament. But this "appointment" or "representation" was an aberration&#13;
for the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                            -15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DL4MOND]&#13;
      It was only when EFC began to take equity shares that IFC acquired, got, took, negotiated, the&#13;
 right to name a representative or specifically to nominate somebody with an understanding among the&#13;
 shareholders that IFC's nominee would be elected. I am now IFC's nominee on an investement bank&#13;
 in Portugal. I might add that IFC came to this position of being willing to name Directors only after a&#13;
 long soul-searching in the management and in the Board of Directors and some objections from some&#13;
 of the shareholders--I mean IFC's shareholders--who felt that putting a man on the Board of Directors&#13;
was tantamount to management. Of course, it isn't. But there's a big dossier of legal opinions running&#13;
I guess from 1962 to certainly to 1966. Legal opinions by the General Counsel of IFC, memos to the&#13;
Board and to management, distinguishing between management and Board membership. But, you&#13;
know, the first years when IFC started doing this, it put a man on the Board only of development&#13;
banks, not of industrial enterprises. Then gradually one by one into industrial enterprises, and it has&#13;
some of those now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I want to get to a little discussion of IFC in a moment, but there are two questions I&#13;
want to ask. First, you were a loan officer during the period we are still talking about. We're still 1950,&#13;
1951, 1952 and so on. I take it a fair amount of your time was spent as a loan officer dealing with the&#13;
development banks anyhow. What I'm getting at is, there was a time in your career where you became&#13;
very closely identified with development banks and you were alnost the Bank's person on that subject.&#13;
But in this earlier time, you were doing lots of other things too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: That's right. There was no specific unit responsible for development banks at that time.&#13;
Not until JFC was assigned full responsibility. It's the coincidence of my being in the right place at the&#13;
right time that I was involved in both the Turkish bank and the Ethiopian one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The next one in which the Bank was involved was India, and there George Woods was asked in&#13;
1953 or 1954 to go and see what he could do about creating a private institution. I should say here, as&#13;
an interesting footnote for you to follow up, that the Bank had been prepared originally to lend to a&#13;
national development bank in India in which the Government held the majority shares. This was the&#13;
Industrial Finance Corporation of India. And just as the Bank was about to consummate that loan, a&#13;
tremendous scandal broke out there. Black, with the Ethiopia experience and then this, is reported to&#13;
have said, "Never again will I touch a state development bank." And he asked Woods to go to promote&#13;
a new private one.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
       Now, I had nothing to do with India, but I was asked to brief Woods on how we'd gone about&#13;
 setting one up in Turkey. What the steps were. Just as a souvenir of my own, I had kept a complete&#13;
 file of the key papers having to do with the discussions and so forth inside the World Bank and another&#13;
 on the steps in the creation of the Turkish institution, beginning all the way from the establishment of&#13;
 the steering committee to the agenda for the steering committee and the legal steps and so forth. And&#13;
 that was a time when I first got to know George Woods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 OLIVER: Before you comment about George Woods, could I just ask why do you think Black decided.&#13;
 to go outside the Bank, so to speak, to get the head of a mission to deal with this problem? Is it just&#13;
 that it seemed like such a natural sort of investment banking concern?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes. I suppose so. For the same reason he went to Harold Johnson for Turkey. The&#13;
three of us from the staff identified the idea on that first mission to Turkey. I went along with Harold,&#13;
but Harold was the guy in charge. Well, you know, here were people from the business community.&#13;
They were investment bankers. George was an investment banker par excellence. They were people&#13;
who knew about financial institutions. Who were we in the World Bank? We had had no experience in&#13;
this field. In a sense I was the only one, but my experience was limited to Turkey and Ethiopia.&#13;
George had also had prior experience in India. So he started with some knowledge, a very good&#13;
knowledge, as far as I know, of conditions in India and in the business community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Can you shed apy light on what that earlier business had been about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No, I can't.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was it a First Boston business?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No, I think he went first for the World Bank. When I spoke of business, I think it was&#13;
World Bank business. But I'm afraid I don't know. I had never had any connection with India. Well,&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -17-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
 my first connection was 1953, but it was strictly holiday. I went on what was supposed to be a one-week&#13;
 assignment in Thailand but I refused to go unless my wife went. And it turned out to be a three-month&#13;
 assignment. We decided we couldn't fly over India both ways without stopping to see it because we&#13;
 might never see it again. Little did we know that I would become very closely associated with India and&#13;
 live there for a year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     So aside from that, I had no connection with India. George Woods had. And he was someone&#13;
that Black and Garner knew and an investment banker and one of the Bank's bankers. I find it quite&#13;
natural. It wasn't the same in Ethiopia, and I can't explain why not, except it was a pretty trivial thing&#13;
from day one in Ethiopia, it was something merely on the fringes. So I spent a good bit of time with&#13;
George Woods preparing him--if I may use that expression--for the Indian promotion We kept in&#13;
touch thereafter as things developed, strictly on a private basis. Sometimes I was asked something, but&#13;
on the basis of the Turkish experience. The same thing happened in connection with Pakistan, because&#13;
he went to Pakistan not long thereafter--within a year or two thereafter--to help create the private&#13;
Pakistani development bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I had become very friendly with George Wishart, and this second George also got involved with&#13;
some development bank promotions. I was on their fringes. It was not in connection with my normal&#13;
job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     A key factor thereafter was that I moved over to the EDI. This was at the request of Alec&#13;
[Sir AlexanderJ Cairncross and with the blessing of Garner. And the EDI of those early days was very&#13;
different from the EDI of today. We sometimes did things we weren't really prepared for, except that&#13;
Alec Cairncross was prepared for anything. I ran the agricultural course, for instance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We had an imported fellow, Javier Marques, a Spaniard from Mexico, who gave the course-on&#13;
fmance, and I was asked if I would conduct a particular meeting on development banks. It was in&#13;
preparation for that meeting that I wrote the first book [Development Banks EDI, 19571, and this sort&#13;
                                                                               1&#13;
of put me into the middle of the picture, although I didn't get fully involved across the board in&#13;
development banks until I moved to IFC for that particular purpose.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                          -18-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 OLIVER: It sounds as though you spent quite a short time in the Thailand and Far East part of your&#13;
 career. Are we leaving anything out there?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No. I spent two 3-month periods in Thailand. And, of course, once the development&#13;
bank business really got underway, I was involved also in Taiwan, heavily in Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia&#13;
and so forth. But in that period when I opted for the Far East rather than Turkey--that's what you're&#13;
referring to--it was essentially Thailand. That was the big active matter for me at that time. But as I&#13;
said, I also had Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, and Nigeria at that time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, you are on tape already from a 1961 interview about the EDI years, so perhaps we do&#13;
not need to talk about that in greater detail. Is it now appropriate to move to IFC?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: Sure. What do you want to ask?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, you have said that you became identified with development banks while you were in&#13;
EDI, in particular because you wrote the book, a copy of which I have in my library. And you were&#13;
then invited to go to IFC to expand the work, so I think a natural question is how did the evolution of&#13;
development banks correspond with the developing work in IFC? And eventually I am told that&#13;
development banks came back out, or industrial projects at least came out of IFC. So there's a whole&#13;
long story it seems to me that needs to be told about that subject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes. I've seen copies of memos in which Bob Garner, at one point in early 1961, made a&#13;
case to Black that the World Bank was cutting into IFC business. He argued that IFC was prepared to&#13;
make loans to good enterprises, but cheaper money was coming from the World Bank through&#13;
development banks. He began a fight with Siem [Simon] Aldewereld and Knapp, who pitched in on the&#13;
other side, and Dick Demuth also got into the argument. Garner made the argument that IFC should&#13;
have priority in dealing with private enterprises, not the World Bank, and the development banks&#13;
themselves ought to be IFC's business. IFC should be investing in them as well as lending to them, and&#13;
on a strictly commercial basis. And the Bank staff was making the opposite kind of argument. I don't&#13;
know that the argument was based so much on reason on the part--I'm sorry to say this--of my Bank&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                          -19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND)&#13;
 friends and associates, so much as on the underlying hostility which many of them, including senior&#13;
 people, felt toward IFC and toward Gamer in particular. In any event, whether this struggle reached a&#13;
 conclusion before Garner's withdrawal from the presidency--which took place in September of 1961--I&#13;
 do not know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     But Marty [Martin M.) Rosen succeeded him, and within months of becoming the Executive Vice&#13;
President, Black decided to establish a unit, a separate department, a development banks department&#13;
in IFC, which would be responsible for advising the whole World Bank Group on its investments in and&#13;
loans to development banks. This was an affirmation by Black that the IFC had the primary role of&#13;
promoting private investement, in the Bank Group, which in fact was why IFC was created. The new&#13;
unit was announced to the public in December 1961, or the beginning of January 1962, and Abdel&#13;
Galeel El Emary, whose name you know, became the head of it. I gave him one of my best staff&#13;
members, with the view that the fellow would be with him only temporarily. But within a few months&#13;
the Bank was asked to assign El Emary to assist the African countries which were trying to establish an&#13;
African development bank. He and Ellsworth Clark from the Legal Department spent about a year on&#13;
that before El Emary returned. Thus the leadership of the new department went begging, and then in&#13;
the Spring of 1962--I guess it was in May--I was asked to become the head of that department. And&#13;
around July 1, I joined IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     By the way, this was under Black's leadership. This was 1962, but remember Black left the Bank&#13;
as of December 31 of that year. So although a lot had started under Black, the real push in the&#13;
development banking field, the real expansion took place really in the five years under George Woods.&#13;
If you look at the capital involved at first, what we thought of as an excellent performance of $200&#13;
million a year in Woods' last year, lent to and invested in development Banks by the Board and IFC&#13;
together, that $200 million is very small compared with about $2.4 billion a year now in lending to and&#13;
investment in development banks, partly because of inflation and partly because of real expansion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But very early in George's stay, in the beginning of 1963, IFC ceased to be simply advisers to the&#13;
Bank and became the technical department for the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You mean an operating department that could make loans, could recommend loans?&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAlMOND                                         -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, we could recommend loans and write the full appraisal reports and participate in&#13;
the working parties and in the negotiations under the area fellow. We stood in the same relationship to&#13;
the loan officers and senior loan officers, although we were an IFC department, that the Bank's&#13;
Technical Operations Department,later broken up into various projects departments, stood with&#13;
respect to other types of projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I'm just a little bit lost here. This department was set up under IFC or under the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Under IFC, in IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: All right, so you are still with IFC?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I am still with IFC. But the difference that I am pointing to between the moment of its&#13;
creation and a within a year thereafter under Woods was that we ceased to be simply advisers and&#13;
became the operating people with the same relationship to the Bank negotiators which the Bank's&#13;
projects departments would have on an agricultural project or a...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: So your department wouldn't technically be making the loans, but you would be&#13;
recommending them through the proper area department of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That's right. To the proper area department. In IFC we became a real operating&#13;
department. We did not simply make a recommendation to the investment departments. We were a&#13;
separate operating department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: We're now up to 1963. Have we skipped too rapidly over the 1956 to 1960 years?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No, no. Nothing stands out particularly except that I was getting on all right and&#13;
enjoying myself. In that period, by the way, in 1960 to 1962 1 became the Assistant Director,&#13;
Department of Operations - Western Hemisphere.&#13;
&#13;

OLIVER: In IFC?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 DIAMOND: No, in the World Bank still. In the World Bank under Orvis Schmidt, whom I mentioned&#13;
 a while back, who had succeeded Burke Knapp when Burke became one of the three Vice Presidents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 OLIVER: I'm sorry for not understanding this better. Tell me the years that you were with IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: July 1962 until November 1, 1968.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I see. I had supposed that you went from EDI in the middle 1950s to IFC. You must have&#13;
been with EDI then for some years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLIAMOND: Three years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Three years, and after EDI and before IFC?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I went back to being a division chief in the Bank. I dealt with Nigeria, Yugoslavia, and&#13;
other odds and ends.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: All right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: There still was not an Africa Department, if I remember correctly, but I wouldn't like to&#13;
swear to that now. I think there was still one big--yes, it was called the Department of Operations -&#13;
Europe, Africa and Australasia, and Pierre Moussa at a certain point was called upon to become the&#13;
Director of the new Africa Department. And then, in 1960, I became Assistant Director for the&#13;
Western Hemisphere.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: All right, now we've got you properly in IFC, and this is 1962?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That's right. Marty Rosen was the Executive Vice President, the chief operating officer.&#13;
And the development bank business boomed, giving IFC responsibility for at least advising. It was&#13;
initiated by Garner, done under Black, and no doubt pushed to a conclusion by Marty. Marty felt that&#13;
the development banks offered an opportunity for the IFC to have, in effect, agents abroad: people,&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                            -22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
 institutions which would be IEC's eyes and ears and consequently moved to establish IFC positions,&#13;
 equity positions in a large number, in a significant number of such institutions. He felt that they could&#13;
 or would be profitable, but beyond that IFC would have collateral benefits in the sense that they would&#13;
 bring us big projects. We would share big projects with them. They would be important sources of&#13;
information on the country. Inside our institution we used the same kinds of arguments which no&#13;
doubt many of the private commercial banks or investment corporations in Europe, Japan and the U.S.&#13;
used for themselves, when Marty and later I were twisting their arms in order to get them to take a&#13;
participation in a private development bank abroad. That is, collateral benefits will mean something to&#13;
you. The financial benefits--you will have them, we promised, but they won't be significant, and you'll&#13;
get a lot of other things from it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And so in one country after another we helped to establish development banks, to enlarge existing&#13;
poor ones, to transform existing ones. Liberia, Tunisia, Nigeria, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia,&#13;
India, Pakistan, five of them in Colombia, one of them in Ecuador, all private. Never the fomento type&#13;
of institution; always the private sector-oriented company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Well, I said a while back, I guess before you put the tape on, in a sense this was my heyday in the&#13;
World Bank Group. The development bank business, that is promoting and financing development&#13;
banks, became very important both to the IFC and to the World Bank. If I remember correctly, either&#13;
in Woods' last year or the year before, 18 to 20 percent of all World Bank lending was to development&#13;
finance institutions. There was about $190 or $200 million at one point, and the total Bank lending was&#13;
just under $1 billion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I take it that both the Bank and IFC might be dealing simultaneously as provider of funds&#13;
for the same project?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLIAMOND: Yes, but they were two different institutions. If you want to point to dangers and risks,&#13;
some argued--subsequently--that our department, which was appraising and commending the same&#13;
development bank both to an investing institution and to a creditor, was subject to a conflict of interest.&#13;
Curiously enough, I don't recall this being pointed out or commented on at that time. It has been&#13;
commented on and pointed out subsequently.&#13;
&amp;#12; DLAMOND                                           -23-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DLAMOND]&#13;
     I personally did not feel any conflicts or tugs in this. I didn't feel that I was leaning one way or&#13;
 another with the World Bank, for instance, because of an IFC position, or vice versa. Maybe this was&#13;
insensitivity on my part. I don't know. I didn't feel it. An issue like this comes up occasionally in some&#13;
of the development bank clients of the World Bank and IFC. Should they establish the equity-taking&#13;
division or unit as a unit separate from those which deal with that same institution as a lender? Some&#13;
do. Some don't. Most of them don't, on the grounds, I guess, of efficiency and simplicity. One staff&#13;
sees the project as a whole, and also the client only has to deal with one staff and not two different&#13;
staffs in the institution or Groups. But I recognize the possibility of conflict there. And it may well be,&#13;
that in an institution different from the World Bank--let's say in a private investment bank where one&#13;
gets paid on a different kind of basis, where the pressures are different--my reaction would be different&#13;
than it ever was here. Well, the Bank Group has a somewhat different kind of approach, however&#13;
private-sector-oriented we may be.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              S&#13;
OLIVER: The IFC investment in any event would have a non-voting equity position which it would sell&#13;
whenever private...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: Not non-voting. It had the right to vote; whether of not it did was a matter of policy.&#13;
When it took an equity position, it had the normal share, with all the share's attributes and rights.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But never as much as 50 percent of the equity?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No, no.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: More like 25 percent?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That would have been the maximum and only in those very peculiar cases where there&#13;
was no possibility of getting a real private majority in a country. Take Liberia. We invented&#13;
something. It was a gimmick, and I'm not sure now, looking back, that it was worth the trouble. If I&#13;
were writing on the subject, I certainly would comment in some detail on this. There was no possibility&#13;
of getting 51 percent private ownership in Liberia. No possibility at all. We were content if the&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                            -24-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
 government just took under 50 percent, and if we could find a few percent truely of private&#13;
 shareholders. For the rest, IFC took 25 percent and we sought the rest from foreign private institutions.&#13;
 We counted IFC as private, like the true private, on the grounds that we would behave properly, but&#13;
 also that ultimately we were holding these shares in trust for people in the private sector to whom we&#13;
 hoped one day to be able to sell. But in the more normal institutions, and good ones as in Korea and&#13;
 in the Philippines, IFC had substantially less than 25 percent. IFC is the biggest shareholder in the&#13;
Portugese financial institution I mentioned before, with about seven-and-a-half percent of the shares.&#13;
I'm not only on the Board as IFC's nominee, I am an active person on the Board, not passive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Is there some intention to sell that seven-and-a-half percent equity?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: Ultimately, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: What determinps the moment when that might happen?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, you really ought to ask that question of someone who is in IFC now. Policies and&#13;
procedures change, and I know that those regarding IFC disinvestments have recently been the subject&#13;
of much internal discussion. But I'll try to tell you what I thought the main determinants were when I&#13;
was in IFC and which I think are still the principal ones. First of all, disinvestment should begin at a&#13;
time when IFC can expect a satisfactory return on its investment. That is, a good capital gain which,&#13;
taken together with the dividends received--which may not have been too good--will provide an overall&#13;
yield on the investment which is reasonably satisfactory. Don't ask me what "reasonably satisfactory'&#13;
means, because that changes from person to person and from time to time. Of course, there have&#13;
been, and will be cases when IFC should disinvest even at a loss; when holding on to the equity means&#13;
losing more than selling out would mean.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Secondly, when IFC becomes a shareholder it is usually not only, and sometimes not primarily,&#13;
because of the importance of the capital that it contributes. It's because IFC's presence is important&#13;
for other reasons. For instance, as a catalyst, as a catalyst to bring in other shareholders, both foreign&#13;
and domestic. Or to facilitate some technological transfers, perhaps from IFC's own experience, a&#13;
factor that has been particularly inportant with financial institutions. Or to help assure shareholder and&#13;
Board stability. Or for some other non-financial reason.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                            -25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sort of a stamp of approval?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, a stamp of approval, but also a matter of putting your money where your mouth is.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But I mean IFC's investment is a stamp of approval which encourages the private&#13;
participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: Yes, that's right. If you think simply of IFC's approval, this could be given orally. But&#13;
the money is the big stamp of approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Of course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: That's the distinction I was making. Then, once you've created one of these institutions,&#13;
you find that you have a collection of shareholders and even a collection of Board members who do not&#13;
have much cohesion. They have different objectives. The local investors and Board members often see&#13;
the new bank as a new type of institution which will bring them direct benefits. But what is that new&#13;
institution, and how will it help them? Often they are not sure. The uncertainty of the shareholders is&#13;
reflected in the Board. The foreign-shareholders also have different objectives. In my Portuguese&#13;
company--please forgive these occasional personal pronouns--the Credit Lyonnais and the Union Bank&#13;
of Switzerland are shareholders and are on the Board. Yes, they want the company to succeed and I&#13;
believe they put their money in gladly. But they have many other axes to grind in Portugal and are&#13;
interested also in benefits for their other objectives. IFC also seeks corollary benefits, but these are not&#13;
seen to loom as large in IFC's plans and expectations. IFC is 'more objective,' they say.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     It takes some time to develop cohesion, an esprit de corps., a common outlook among the&#13;
members of the Board. IFC has often been a key factor in that process, because it is recognized that its&#13;
principal concerns are the welfare of the company and of the country--in addition, of course, to an&#13;
appropriate financial return to all the shareholders. Thus another factor IFC looks for, or used to look&#13;
for before considering disinvestment, is the stability of the Board of the company.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                            -26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
      Then there is the matter of transmission of advice to the company--competence, guidance in a&#13;
 variety of areas vital to the performance of a financial institution. IFC, not simply as a Board member,&#13;
 but as a repository of experience, plays an important part in this process, too. Has the company shown&#13;
 by its performance that it knows what it is doing? Does it have a management that you can now trust,&#13;
 not simply because you know its record before the bank was created, but because of its actual&#13;
 performance in the new bank itself? Sometimes this takes a few years. Sometimes, it takes a much&#13;
 longer time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Thus, profitability, stability and performance. These are elements I think IFC looks at when it&#13;
considers the time has come to begin disvestement. It must also consider whether the fact of sale,&#13;
partially or completely, will be in itself a destabilizing influence. Other key shareholders almost always&#13;
object to IFC's disengaging. And another issue is, of course, whether IFC can sell. You can't always&#13;
find a buyer. Even if there is a stock exchange and the company's shares are quoted, few institutions&#13;
are so profitable that other investors can be convinced they can make a better return from the shares&#13;
IFC is ready to sell than from other investments available to them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Is IFC allowed to keep the capital gain it there is some?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: Yes. Oh, certainly. They keep capital gains and they can transfer them. Otherwise, why&#13;
should IFC invest? After all, it is supposed to support private international investment and should be a&#13;
model of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Has IFC sold off entirely any of the investments that it's made in these development banks?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: Yes. I can't tell you all of them, but it sold out completely from a bank in Spain--in&#13;
which I think it shouldn't have invested in the first place. It sold out entirely in Greece. It was asked by&#13;
the Government to sell out in Nigeria because the Government wanted to take over the whole&#13;
company, and all the private shareholders did sell except for about one or two percent which is held by&#13;
a single private Nigerian who refused to sell. When last I saw him, in 1978, he still hadn't sold. He said&#13;
he didn't need the money and the Government wasn't going to tell him what he could own and what he&#13;
couldn't own. IFC sold out in the Philippines, and thereby hangs a tale that I want to tell you. It sold&#13;
out very quickly in the Philippines. Well, I haven't given you the whole list.&#13;
&amp;#12;DIAMOND                                              -27-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I can look that up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I know. It sold out in Malaysia, I believe. It's still in Korea, Thailand, Liberia, Morocco,&#13;
Tunisia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In the Philippines a peculiar situation arose. George Woods promoted the company. He&#13;
organized the steering committee and guided its deliberations. The World Bank loan and the IFC&#13;
investment were made in December 1962, approved by the Board together with the investment in and&#13;
loan to BNDE [Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique] in Morrocco on December&#13;
20--a detail which I remember because it's my birthday. So the IFC and the Bank got into the act&#13;
financially just as Woods became President. And then every year there was a hell of a hassle at the&#13;
shareholders meeting. Ordinarily, IFC does not vote its shares except for purposes of quorum. It's&#13;
only if it feels its interest is at stake that it will cast a vote. When I go as IFC's representative to the&#13;
shareholders meeting in Portugal, I usually simply check in for the quorum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: When the vote comes, you say present?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: I don't have to say anything. The Chairman of the General Assembly, who is a lawyer,&#13;
didn't understand this at all. I had to explain to him why we don't vote except for quorum, and he&#13;
agreed that, in order not to make me conspicuous since everybody knows that I'm an active Board&#13;
member, he would never ask who's in favor. He always asks who's opposed, and maybe somebody&#13;
raises his hand, but usually not. The first time this happened, somebody among the shareholders&#13;
protested. So my non-voting is not conspicuous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But IFC ordinarily doesn't vote and there was a hell of a battle in Manila. No Filipino shareholder&#13;
held a significant amount of shares so he could dominate, if not control, the composition of the Board&#13;
of Directors. And each year we had to do two things. The Chairman, the first Chairman of the Board&#13;
was Francisco Ortigas, who had been personally chosen by Woods as Chairman of the Steering&#13;
Committee and then as first Chairman of the Board. We always sent him a proxy saying for purposes&#13;
of quorum you vote, and for purposes of the election we rely on you to vote our shares. He usually told&#13;
us in advance what the situation was and who it was that he thought we ought to support, and we&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -28-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
 said we supported that slate. IFC had complete trust in him. This went on for two or three years, and&#13;
 finally George said, "I'm fed up with this. We never will get a stable situation there unless one of the&#13;
 Filipino shareholders holds a considerably larger stake." He identified who this might be and sold&#13;
 IFC's shares to him. That shareholder then nominated the Chairman of the Board after Ortigas left,&#13;
and was Chairman until four or five years ago. That was the reason for the very early sellout.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In my time of dealing with development banks overall, which means up until 1972, it never&#13;
happened again. And I'd be reasonably sure it hasn't happened since. But it was an interesting case. I&#13;
think George was right. I might add that the Filipino bank did settle down afterwards. The battling on&#13;
the Board and among the shareholders ceased. The man who became the second and long-time&#13;
Chairman was a very sensible and very able person. That was Georges's solution, a solution to an&#13;
unexpected problem. It worked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     We've talked about the expansion of development banks, of development bank work under Woods,&#13;
but there was something else that took place at roughly the same time. In 1964 or 1965, the Industrial&#13;
Division of the Technical Operations Department was transferred to the IFC and an Engineering&#13;
Department was created out of it. Much of the Bank staff connected with industry came over; together&#13;
with engineers that IFC already had, it became the Engineering Department. This had, again, the&#13;
double task of providing the engineering background for IFC projects and providing technical advice to&#13;
the World Bank on state-owned industrial projects, of which the World Bank continued to do some,&#13;
but I think very few.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: What was the rationale for the transfer?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, I believe that the rationale was, or what Woods said to himself was, that the IFC&#13;
needs a clear delineation of its functions. What was IFC's role? The transfer was a second affirmation&#13;
of IFC's primary role in the Bank Group in dealing with the private sector. In addition, I think it&#13;
reflected the view that IFC should also be the chosen instrument for dealing with industry in the World&#13;
Bank Group. Remember that the Bank had not yet opened the door to financing state industry. We&#13;
had two avenues, two channels, for dealing with industry: one was direct loans to industrial enterprise&#13;
if it was in the private sector and if they were large, and secondly wholesaling to intermediary&#13;
&amp;#12;DIAMOND                                            -29-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[DIAMOND]&#13;
institutions for retailing to smaller private sector enterprises. So I see this transfer as a reinforcement,&#13;
or declaration, of IFC's role as the private arm and the industrial arm of the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Let me add that it was at about this time also that Woods took another very important step vis-a-&#13;
vis the IFC. This was the beginning of Bank loans to IFC. lFC had been a small institution almost&#13;
unnoticed in the world, certainly very rarely noticed, until it went actively into development banking,&#13;
became responsible for all of industry, and got a big addition to its capital resources, in the form of&#13;
loans from the World Bank. I think this combination of three things was Woods' contribution towards&#13;
the real launching of IFC. Now, the numbers, even in Woods' time, just don't compare with what has&#13;
happened since. But this was the takeoff, with more capital and an expanded role.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And it wasn't just industry. Tourism and services of various kinds started up. So IFC had industry&#13;
under its control or it was in a decisive advisory position, and it had development banks in its control&#13;
and a lot more capital than before. I think the first Bank loan to IFC in 1966 was a $100 million of&#13;
credit--part of a potential $400 million. Some place I've seen the statement that Marty Rosen was not&#13;
very happy about the idea of Bank lending to IFC. Have you heard that? I have no reason to believe&#13;
this. The argument was that he was unhappy about it because it implied a certain degree of World&#13;
Bank supervision, which it never did--certainly not in my time--but also, more importantly, because it&#13;
meant a larger IFC which he might find more difficult to control personally. He was a fellow who&#13;
played his cards close to his chest. It's not impossible. But I know no direct evidence of it, and&#13;
somehow or other it doesn't ring right to me.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: In the case of the transfer of the Industrial Division staff to IFC, was that Marty Rosen's&#13;
recommendation, do you know?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I don't know. Whether it was initiated by Rosen or Woods, I don't quite know. But&#13;
both of them would have been equally concerned--certainly Marty would have been concerned--about&#13;
clarifying the identity of IFC in relationship to the Bank. And industry was the obvious major area for&#13;
the identification. Whoever it was who originated the idea, doesn't really make any difference. They&#13;
were both there.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                          -30-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 OLIVER: I take it this was also George Woods putting a stamp of approval on the proposition that&#13;
 industrial projects should be private industrial projects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 DLIAMOND: Yes, I would guess so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: This is at about the time, for example, when there was a major Bank mission to Algeria&#13;
which had only a few years before become independent. The mission recommended, as I understand&#13;
it, major Bank financing of petroleum activities in Algeria. And the Bank, I think, did not accede to the&#13;
recommendations of the report. I wondered whether it was because it was supposed that this was a&#13;
private kind of activity for which there was plenty of financing outside the Bank-IFC complex or&#13;
whether it was because the Algerian Government wanted to do it wholly as a state enterprise and&#13;
George Woods personally objected to that. There were lots of issues here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DiAMOND: Was this [Driagoslav] Avramovic's mission?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: The mission was the occasion on which Woods created that wonderful expression,&#13;
"We've sent a 'thundering herd' into Algeria." There must have been 30 or more members on that&#13;
mission, "the thundering herd." Of course, these days, as I mentioned to you on another occasion,&#13;
almost every mission is a thundering herd.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well nowadays as compared with the early 1950s, the first few missions you were on were&#13;
hardly thundering herds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That's right. Well, that first one that I went on to Thailand in 1963 had eight people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But that's neither here nor there. Then [Robert S.] McNamara came. On April Fool's Day 1968.&#13;
And within six months my department was transferred bodily to the World Bank. It became a normal,&#13;
no, not quite normal, technical department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVIER: What had been the title of the department in IFC?&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -31-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 DIAMOND: We went through several changes. It started as the Development Banks Services&#13;
 Department. At a certain point, when he had been there very shortly--this is an interesting&#13;
 point--George Woods said, "I'm not trying to create banks, I'm trying to develop investment&#13;
 institutions. I'm trying to create development corporations. They should be promotional. They should&#13;
 be operating in the capital market. They are not institutions which sit back and make a loans to&#13;
 applicants." By the way, this philosophy already appeared in my book of 1957. The fact is most of such&#13;
 institutions remained primarily lenders. But Woods issued those instructions. The question arose what&#13;
 to name the department and to get that word "banks' out. He didn't want to see it in the name, so, in&#13;
due course, it was changed to Development Finance Companies Department. But we went through&#13;
several transformations, changes of name, thereafter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In any event, within six months after McNamara came we were transferred bodily. We became a&#13;
technical department of the World Bank and advisors to the IFC, exactly the opposite of the provious&#13;
situation. What distinguished us from the other technical departments, Agriculture, Public Utilities,&#13;
etcetera, was that our department was responsible directly to McNamara. All the other technical&#13;
departments, projects departments, were lumped together under something called Technical&#13;
Operations and later Projects Department under one super-director, Siem Aldewereld. That was what&#13;
distinguished us. Otherwise, we behaved like those departments. We did the work of promoting and&#13;
appraising and supervising development bank projects. When it came to negotiating loans for them,&#13;
that was under the chairmanship of the area man.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Why McNamara did it this way I'm not sure. He never told me. Rosen, I think, made an&#13;
argument to him that our department had become quite influential and the it's clout would disappear.&#13;
I remember Rosen several times using that word, 'clout". He said he wanted to try to retain for my&#13;
department the clout that it had had in IFC, clout outside as well as inside the institution. McNamara&#13;
must have bought that argument. I wasn't even responsible to Burke Knapp. I remember at least one&#13;
director of an area department coming to me with great concern and saying, "How can I deal with you&#13;
now that you are responsible to McNamara? If there's any debate between us you'll immediately&#13;
appeal to him". I said that was ridiculous. That would be the way to end any influence I might have&#13;
with McNamara. And the fact is I never took an interdepartmental debate to him, except for one&#13;
occasion which had nothing to do with a project. Either I worked it out or I went to exactly the same&#13;
person that the regional people went to, Burke. Individual loan issues weren't the kinds of things that I&#13;
felt it appropriate to raise with McNamara. I kept our meetings, which is another story, more&#13;
substantial, on more policy-oriented matters.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[DIAMOND]&#13;
     We were transferred. A lot of factors entered into this. I think there was an increasing&#13;
resentment among many Bank staff that a part of their loans, which was an important 15 to 20 percent&#13;
of total loans at this time, were being in a sense controlled by IFC. That resentment started under&#13;
Woods, continued under McNamara. Also, McNamara quickly made up his mind--although it wasn't&#13;
put into effect until October or November--that the Bank would begin to lend to state-owned&#13;
development banks and it would have been an oddity to have a private sector oriented institution be&#13;
responsible for the appraisal of a state development bank. Maybe there were other factors as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     And not long after that, I think, the Engineering Department of IFC was divided. I'm afraid I do&#13;
not recall which year that happened, but it would have been very soon after my department was&#13;
transferred. There remained in IFC an engineering staff which was responsible for the engineering&#13;
aspects of IFC's projects. But the rest was moved back to the Bank and became an industry&#13;
department to deal with lending to individual large enterprises, state or private. Well, this was, you&#13;
know, reversing the line Woods had pursued with respect to IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     What was the particular question which I was addressing with all this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I think you've answered it. I was asking why it came about that the industry was given&#13;
back, so to speak, to the Bank and also what was the origin of the resumption of lending to state-owned&#13;
industrial enterprises. And I think you've pretty well dealt with that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Mind you, it wasn't a resumption so much as a systematic expansion. The Bank never&#13;
absolutely refused to lend to a state-owned industrial enterprise. It always had lent to state utilities, but&#13;
you're thinking of industrials, and sometimes the line is not so clear. For instance, one of the state&#13;
enterprises that the World Bank lent to long before McNamara was Sui Gas in Pakistan, a state-owned&#13;
enterprise, in 1954, under Black. But there was an undertaking that, over a period of time, a&#13;
controlling share-interest would be sold to private entrepreneurs; and it was. There was another case,&#13;
also in Pakistan, with a similar understanding, I think in fertilizers. So there had been some lending to&#13;
state enterprises. However, certainly the prevailing policy was that the Bank should not do this; that&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAhMOND                                         -33-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
 the state was not a good entrepreneur or manager of an enterprise; that the cost was high; and that&#13;
 problems were virtually inevitable. McNamara turned this around with a specific memorandum in the&#13;
 case of development banks. His argument, in effect, was: ownership is of no signifcance to us; what is&#13;
 important is efficiency of operation. It makes no difference who owns the bank. This isn't quite or&#13;
always true, as indeed the Bank must have decided, because recently the thing is turning around again.&#13;
I can't blame the new turnaround entirely on Mr. Reagan. It comes also, maybe primarily, from the&#13;
 Bank's own experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I guess one example I can give is this. I was asked to do something for Moeen Qureshi when he&#13;
was Executive Vice President of IFC a few years ago, concerning the role of the private sector in&#13;
economic development--I did a fair amount of work as a comsultant to him. I asked the help of one&#13;
Bank department director, whose work was directly relevant to my task. That director received me but&#13;
refused to "waste" any time talking about the private and public sectors the roles and the problems, and&#13;
so forth. Ownership was of no interest, I was told. All that counted was efficiency in operation. But&#13;
time marched on and the atmosphere changed. And three or four years ago, when private activity&#13;
once again became a matter of great significance in the Bank, a series of articles was published in&#13;
Finance and Development which were gathered into a single brochure and lo, the keynote article on&#13;
the importance of private activity was by that same department director who had turned me down.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Ah, that's very interesting. Is there time for you to just give a short summary of the 30 years&#13;
experience that you had?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I'll do a summary of personalities. You said something about landmarks, but I didn't&#13;
know whether you meant my landmarks or landmarks in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Both.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND. I find that a little difficult.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Your personal landmarks, certainly, but to the extent that you care to comment on general&#13;
Bank landmarks, that would be valuable also. And also stories.&#13;

 DLAMOND: Okay. I hope I made some contribution. And I have some stories, but they're not all&#13;
 amusing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 OLIVER: They don't have to be amusing; they can be illustrative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: The story that I'll tell you right now is one in which I'm not sure whether I'm the butt or&#13;
McNamara is the butt. I suppose I am, so I don't mind telling it with no restrictions on its use. I was&#13;
responsible to him until the big reorganization of the Bank in 1972. Our arrangements in that earlier&#13;
time was that we would have a regular meeting every other week, and I could call him and ask to see&#13;
him any time I had a problem which called for urgent attention. I rarely did that. The bi-weekly&#13;
meetings took place fairly regularly, and I usually sent him a little agenda; sometimes there were a few&#13;
notes attached to the agenda, just headings. Sometimes he would cancel the meeting, just having&#13;
written on the side of the agenda, "I agree," or 'It is fine with me." Our meeting, by the way, always&#13;
took place immediately after lunch, and perhaps I should have refused to accept that time. But the&#13;
moment I will never forget was the day that he fell asleep as I was talking. He was just sound asleep in&#13;
his chair. When I suddenly realized this, I stopped talking. And the silence must have awakened him&#13;
after a few seconds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: This was a meeting of two persons?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, between him and me. This was my bi-weekly meeting with McNamara. As I say,&#13;
occasionally a month went by because sometimes we would postpone our meeting. But I must have&#13;
been mighty dull or boring or had no issues of significance on that particular day; or it may just have&#13;
been the post-lunch doldrums. As I said, I guess I'm the butt of that story.&#13;

 Date of Interview July 22, 1986&#13;
 Place of Interview: Washington, D.C.&#13;
 Interviewer: Robert Oliver&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: After a hiatus of a few days, I am continuing my conversation with Mr. Diamond. This is&#13;
July 22, 1986. Perhaps we can begin this second conversation by my asking Mr. Diamond if there are&#13;
any amendments that he cares to make to the first conversation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I discovered in checking back, after seeing you, that I had made a mistake in telling you&#13;
that the name of our department in IFC had changed several times. In fact it changed once. When the&#13;
department was created in January 1962, just two or three weeks after Mr. Black made the&#13;
announcement of the estabhlishment of the department, it was called the Development Banks Services&#13;
Department and retained that title until the spring of 1964, about a year after Mr. Woods became&#13;
President. He became President January 1, 1963, if I remember correctly. And the change was a&#13;
reaction to his feeling that the word "bank" did not give the flavor of the kind of institution that he&#13;
wanted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    After some searching around we came up with the title, Development Finance Companies, which&#13;
became the name of the department and so remained throughout that period. It retained that same&#13;
name when we were transferred bodily to the World Bank and continued to have that name even after&#13;
the reorganization by Mr. McNamara in 1972. The rump department that remained in the Central&#13;
Projects complex retained the name until not long before Mr. McNamara left, when the department&#13;
was given further responsibilities. When the regional divisions were given more responsibilities they&#13;
changed the name from Development Finance Companies to Industrial Development and Finance&#13;
Divisions. You'll be amused to know that my first book on development banks is called Development&#13;
Banks and the second one is called Development Finance Companies: Aspects of Policy and&#13;
Operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I also noted something which I might just call to your attention. I refer to the fact that President&#13;
Black announced a concentration of development bank work in IFC in December 1961 or January&#13;
1962. In fact there was a circular on December 28, 1961 and the administrative circular creating the&#13;
department came the next month. But I found among my papers first of all the text of a statement he&#13;
presented to the Board at a meeting on October 17, 1961 and the transcript of some of the discussion.&#13;
&amp;#12; DLAMOND                                          -36-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DLAMOND]&#13;
 The meeting was on the subject of the future of IFC; it was just after Marty Rosen became Executive&#13;
 Vice President. He referred to the fact that he was thinking of giving new emphasis to development&#13;
 banks and was contemplating combining responsibility for development banks in the Bank and IFC into&#13;
 the IFC. And that was followed by the announcement on December 28. This is only to help whoever&#13;
does research on this to identify some dates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That's a very useful addendum to our first conversation. Your mentioning Mr. Woods in&#13;
connection with loans to industry leads me to ask sort of a follow-up question: I have been told by&#13;
some that Mr. Woods was very anxious to increase the lending by the Bank and of course to increase&#13;
the IDA Replenishment. He has been quoted to me as having said once, I think in a Board meeting&#13;
though it might have been in a senior staff meeting, that a bank which never had any defaults was a&#13;
bank that was not taking enough risks. Can you comment on Mr. Woods' general attitude toward&#13;
increasing lending, and particularly his emphasis upon industry?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, I have heard him say that. If you had no bad debts, then this means you're not&#13;
taking enough risks. This, of course, related to the comment I made before about his interest in&#13;
switching from the idea of a bank to the idea of something much more aggressive, like development&#13;
finance corporation. I believe that the comment was made in connection with a report I gave him at&#13;
that time on the condition of the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey, which was the first of the&#13;
institutions which we helped to promote and which we financed from the beginning. It reflected his&#13;
feeling that these institutions should be not simply bankers, but much more.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Is that the end of that comment?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, I think so. Did you have another aspect of that comment?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: No, I just wanted to corroborate the impression I had from elsewhere on George Woods'&#13;
attitude on the subject of being more aggressive.&#13;
&amp;#12; DLAMOND                                           -37-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [OLIVER]&#13;
     Since you've mentioned Turkey, I'm reminded of a question I wanted to ask in our first session&#13;
 about Turkey. There was a time in the 1950s, I believe, when relations between Turkey and the Bank&#13;
were not very good and the Bank ceased lending to Turkey for a brief period of time. Since you were&#13;
pretty close to Turkey, is there anything you care to add to that, about that phase of the Bank's history?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, I'm afraid I can't tell you with any accuracy exactly what the factors were that went&#13;
into this deterioration of relations. When Mr. Garner was Vice President, Turkey was one of the two&#13;
countries which were his fair-haired children, the other being Colombia. These were his two favorites&#13;
and it may well be that one of the things that brought me close to him was the fact that we saw a great&#13;
deal of each other in connection with Turkey. But a moment came when several things conspired to&#13;
happen more or less at the same time. The Government of Adnan Menderes, the so-called "Free&#13;
Enterprise Govermnent" of the Democratic Party, began to go a little haywire in its development plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      At the same time, arrangements were made, at the Bank's request, for the Turks to accept&#13;
Mr. Pieter Lieftinck as the Bank's Special Representative there. The reason was that Lieftinck had a&#13;
terrific reputation, rightly, for having achieved the recovery of The Netherlands after the war. And it&#13;
was felt that having a man of that caliber on the spot could greatly assist the Turks in keeping them on&#13;
a more straight and narrow path, if that's the right expression, in achieving their development goals.&#13;
But it wasn't very long after Pieter got on the spot that it became clear to the Turks that they weren't&#13;
getting the kind of advice they wanted, and relations graduaEly broke down between them. I cannot&#13;
recall now how long he stayed there, but it couldn't have been more than two years. Finally they&#13;
explicitly asked that he be withdrawn and he was withdrawn, to everybody's regret.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I might add that there was another event involved in this deterioration of relations, to which I think&#13;
I did allude last time, and that was an effort of the Menderes Government to pack the Board of the&#13;
Industrial Development Bank. This led Mr. Black to ask for something which the Bank had never&#13;
asked for before and to my knowledge has never asked for since: it asked that someone in whom it had&#13;
complete confidence be named to the IDB's Board as sort of a watchdog. This man was an eminent&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -38-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
 lawyer whom some of us had known--I had known since the war, and Mr. Black had met also met&#13;
 him--Hazim Atif Kuyucak. It was part of the general atmosphere of the breakdown. I need only add&#13;
that it wasn't just a peculiarity of the Bank or of Pieter Lieftinck which brought about this deterioration&#13;
of relations. It wasn't too long before there was a coup by the Army, and Menderes and two of his top&#13;
ministers were hanged. There had been a break in relations of several years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Indeed, when the time came to renew relations in 1959--even before the coup--I was about to go to&#13;
India to live there for a year as an advisor to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India.&#13;
I was asked to leave a little earlier and go to Turkey to personally introduce the first World Bank&#13;
mission after the renewal. It was a rather large mission, under John Adler's direction. The reason that&#13;
I was asked to do this was my long connection with Turkey. I knew people from both parties. But I&#13;
imagine you'll get a fuller account of this, not only from many members of the existing staff but from&#13;
Lieftinck, should you decide to speak to him again.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes, that's a very good source. That leads to one additional question of a very general&#13;
nature. It appears in July 1986 that the [Barber] Conable World Bank will be associated with a great&#13;
deal of conditionality, to use a word that comes from the Fund. Some people from outside the Bank&#13;
have talked about the leverage of the Bank and the Bank's attempt to make borrowing governments&#13;
conform to Bank ways of doing things. Is it worth my asking you to comment on the gradual evolution&#13;
toward greater Bank emphasis in its lending policy of certain adjustments in the fiscal and monetary&#13;
and perhaps other policies of member governments?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It's for you to judge whether it's worthwhile. You associate conditionality or policy&#13;
orientation with the, quote, "Conable Bank," unquote. In fact, it had been cooking for a long time and&#13;
the argument could be made that it was one of the characteristics of the [Alden Winship] Clausen&#13;
Bank. The movement towards policy-based loans very much came to the fore in the Clausen times.&#13;
One can go back still farther and fimd the beginnings of it in the period of Mr. McNamara.&#13;
&amp;#12;DLAMOND                                            -39-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I had assumed that in a sense the beginnings of this might even go back to this Turkish&#13;
experience you were talking about, where the Bank renewed its relations with Turkey in part because&#13;
the Turkish Government acceded to some requests made by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DTAMOND: Well, Mr. Oliver, ever since Day One--I shouldn't say Day One, since the World Bank's&#13;
first loans were made to European countries which were vastly more capable of running their own&#13;
affairs than the World Bank was--ever since very early in the history of the Bank, it has made an effort&#13;
to influence policy. This is sometimes forgotten, but it did. And policy in a very broad way. I referred&#13;
last time, and others must have no doubt spoken to you about, the general survey missions which the&#13;
Bank began mounting--when, in 1950? Or was it earlier?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Oh, I think it was earlier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: The first one was to Colombia under Lauchlin Currie, and then the second one to&#13;
Turkey. Such missions were sent ultimately, I think, to about 20 or 30 countries. The whole object of&#13;
those exercises was to lay out for the country the broad outlines of a development program and of the&#13;
government policies that would be appropriate to assist in the achievement of that program. This was&#13;
an effort to influence policy. The Bank very early in its career was deeply involved in policies with&#13;
respect to the pricing of the services provided by public utilities. A conflict took place between the&#13;
Bank and several member countries about the price of electricity, about the organization of public&#13;
service enterprises such as port authorities and about other matters. These were efforts to influence&#13;
policy. But there was a gap between efforts to influence policy in a general way and the specific, totally&#13;
project-oriented operations of the Bank. It was possible to say we would not make a loan to Turkey,&#13;
for instance, for the Seyhan Dam until Turkey established an independent authority to build and&#13;
operate the dam and adopted a satisfactory rate structure. Generally, however, anything broader that&#13;
the application of the policy to a specific project was not much in the air at that time. The survey&#13;
missions were designed to help create an environment conducive to development, an "enabling&#13;
environment"; but the results of those missions were not closely linked to the Bank's operations.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                              -40-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
     In McNamara's time, a loan for a particular sector might be held up for a particular project until&#13;
 agreement was reached on a policy package affecting the sector as a whole; and specific projects&#13;
 started to be designed and financed specifically to give effect to those policies. For instance, the Bank&#13;
 had almost always made loans to specific development banks. Beginning in the middle 1970s, the Bank&#13;
 began to adopt for some countries the practice of "apex lending." In the Philippines, where this device&#13;
 was used, instead of making a loan to the PDCP, the Private Development Corporation of the&#13;
 Philippines, to which the Bank had been lending since December 1962, there was an offer of a single&#13;
 loan to the Government for relending to the private sector through several financial institutions, but on&#13;
condition that the Government adopt certain broad policies with respect to the financial sector as a&#13;
whole. "Leverage" became a battle-cry. No doubt broadening the coverage of Bank finance was also&#13;
an objective. But to some extent that could have been achieved by individual loans to individual&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     This style of lending has become a feature of recent Bank operations, adapted, of course, to&#13;
different sectors. Yes, it is-said, project financing is fine; but the old policies remain, and so long as the&#13;
old policies continue there will be no basic change in the orientation of the country or any speed-up of&#13;
the development process. Therefore, loans should be conditioned on the adoption of beneficial&#13;
macroeconomic and sector policies; and the loans should be designed to support those policies. There&#13;
will be others in or from the Bank who can give you a better and more finely-tuned picture of this type&#13;
of lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Frankly I was dubious that the Bank would have significantly more leverage in the Philippines, for&#13;
instance, with a single $200 million loan for the use of several financial institutions together, than it&#13;
would have with several separate loans to individual institutions. Besides, there was the grave&#13;
disadvantage in apex lending that the Bank distanced itself from the beneficiary institutions, relying on&#13;
an apex institution to appraise and to supervise the distribution and use of the loan. Moreover, at the&#13;
same time, the Bank became increasingly interested in sectoral objectives--not only the financial sector,&#13;
but also exports, small-scale enterprises, internal geographical distribution, etcetera, and seemed to&#13;
lose interest in the financial institutions themselves.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                          -41-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMONDJ&#13;
     Back to your original question, I think the movement towards policy lending was a gradual process,&#13;
 developed and elaborated over time and, indeed, evolved from the Bank's own experience and&#13;
changing perceptions of the development process. But the concept really took on new dimensions,&#13;
both quantitatively and qualitatively, in McNamara's time. What has troubled me about the approach,&#13;
aside from the specific points I've just made with respect to development banks, what has bothered me&#13;
is that in McNamara's time it appears to me that the Bank began to make, and seemingly to act on, the&#13;
assumption that it could effectively manage its many and varied member countries. I'm putting this in&#13;
an exaggerated way, but I think you get my point. I have felt that the Bank certainly could have been&#13;
more influential than it was and I feel that it can now be more influential than it has been. But I do not&#13;
think that the Bank is competent to manage India, to redirect Indian policy and Thai policy and&#13;
Bolivian policy, no matter how well the Bank is staffed and led, sitting here in Washington. I don't&#13;
think Mr. McNamara felt it was asking too much, however. He probably would have said, "If we can&#13;
get to the moon, and if we can track missiles from the moment they leave home bases, there's no&#13;
reason why we shouldn't be able to track and manage everything that happens in Tanzania." But I&#13;
think tracking missiles and getting to the moon are a different matter from running other countries'&#13;
economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Were you aware in the middle 1960s of a proposal coming out of the Economics&#13;
Department called the Supplementary Finance...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

consultative groups.&#13;

satisfying one. As long ago as 1960 to 1962, when I was Deputy Director of what was then called the&#13;
Western Hemisphere Department in the Bank, the chief economist of the department and some other&#13;
collegues and I felt that for some Latin American countries there was room for aid coordination. At&#13;
that time no coordination existed among the donors. The chief economist was John Adler, and with&#13;
him, I don't know whether he had the rank of associate chief economist or not, was Jerry Alter. We&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -42-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
 identified a few countries where we thought the time had come for coordination and which could&#13;
 benefit from it. We prepared a memorandum to the Director of the Western Hemisphere Department&#13;
 and to Burke Knapp who, although he was one of the three Vice Presidents at the time, took a special&#13;
 interest in Latin America, of which he had once been Director. But we got nowhere. Whether Burke&#13;
 took it up with the President or the other Vice Presidents, I do not know. In any event, Orvis Schmidt&#13;
 and Burke did not feel that it was appropriate for the Bank to move actively into the field of aid&#13;
coordination. Whether this was a matter of principle or a matter of timing, I do not know. This, I say,&#13;
was 1960 or 1961, and I guess the India Consortium wasn't very old. In any event, the concept of aid&#13;
coordination was a relatively new one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I next got involved in a much more satisfying, not at a3l frustrating way, when, following the&#13;
reorganization of October 1, 1972, under Mr. McNamara, I became Director of the South Asia&#13;
Programs Department. There I inherited the chairmanship of the India Consortium, the Pakistan&#13;
Consortium and the Sri Lanka Aid Coordination Group. This work, was to me the most satisfying part&#13;
of my brief three-year tenure as head of that department. It would be hard to explain why it was so&#13;
satisfying. Maybe it was because I did much of my consortium work outside of Washington. In South&#13;
Asia, I had moved into a department where most of the staff had long worked on the Region and knew&#13;
their countries well, and under a vice president who also knew them well and who could and did&#13;
second-guess, me as I had no doubt occasionally done to the staff of my old DFC Department. I could&#13;
manage the work in my new department, but probably could add little of substance. Also, abroad there&#13;
were not the multiple layers of authority and other departments looking over my shoulder. Moreover, I&#13;
enjoyed taking an active part in trying to persuade donor governments to adopt the Bank staff's view&#13;
with respect to the economies of those countries and to negotiate with them on the volume of aid that&#13;
was to be given each year. The consortia had an influence, I felt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In this connection, the most difficult task I dealt with was debt relief. Both India and Pakistan&#13;
needed it. In the case of India there had already begun to be annual debt relief exercises, as part of the&#13;
annual aid package. This was a very difficult thing because the views of the U.S. Government towards&#13;
foreign aid had changed since Mr. Woods' time and its attitude towards India was not the most helpful.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIA,MOND                                          -43-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DLAMONDJ&#13;
 Their views with respect to debt relief were particularly negative. The Japanese tended, at the&#13;
 beginning of each negotiation, each year's relief, to follow very much in the American wake. Moreover,&#13;
 at that time India was a very unpopular country in Japan. It has since changed; Japan is now very&#13;
 active in India and vice versa. But at that time the question of the Japanese attitude towards India&#13;
bothered me so much that I made a specific trip to Japan on the way home from one of these&#13;
consortium meetings to question my Japanese friends as to the origins of this allergy of one to the&#13;
other.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In the case of Pakistan, the question of debt relief came up in the beginning of my last year as&#13;
Chairman. This was particularly interesting to me because I was thoroughly fed up by the annual&#13;
exercise in India. It was quite clear from the figures which our economists and debt specialists&#13;
provided that the Pakistanis were going to be faced with this problem for several years to come. And&#13;
therefore we tried, and I'm pleased to say succeeded, in persuading governments and in negotiating&#13;
with the Pakistanis to accept a four-year debt relief arrangement. It won't surprise you that, although&#13;
this was successfully completed, I'm told that the need for further debt relief arose again in due course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then came Bangladesh. Just about half a year before I became Director of the South Asia&#13;
Department, Bangladesh came into existence. It was then considered, in Kissinger's expression, a&#13;
basket case. It was in a very difficult situation and it was an obvious candidate for substantially more&#13;
aid and for aid coordination. We moved very quickly to try to create a coordinating instrument. The&#13;
Bangladeshi, however, were unhappy about the fact that a foreign institution, the World Bank, would&#13;
manage the consortium. They attempted a first meeting in Bangladesh, under their own chairmanship.&#13;
But it didn't work well and everybody was unhappy. The first real meeting took place in Paris under&#13;
my chairmanship and the Bangladesh Aid Group has been, I am told, a reasonably effective&#13;
instrument. I guess a few meetings took place under my chairmanship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Our staff came up with the proposal that Nepal could benefit from such assistance. Also Burma, it&#13;
was felt then, was beginning to open up a bit. I'm not sure that it has, in fact, done so but it gave that&#13;
impression. And consequently, in my period as head of that department, I helped the staff to work out&#13;

 [DIAMOND)&#13;
 the arrangements for meetings and to develop the first documentation for aid groups for those&#13;
 countries. By the time the first meetings of these two new aid groups took place, in Japan, I was out of&#13;
 the picture. That's my association with aid coordination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And one of Woods' contributions, I think, was to greatly expand the idea of the Bank's role in aid&#13;
coordination during his period. It's one of his many contributions, which we can talk about later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You have served in the Bank under at least four Presidents, and I wonder if I can combine&#13;
two questions. May I ask you if you would briefly summarize the highlights of your more than 30 years&#13;
in the Bank, and perhaps in passing say a word about the personalities of the people that you've worked&#13;
with, including Presidents and Vice Presidents such as Mr. Garner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I'll make some comments. Thirty-and-a-half years is a long time. I served under four&#13;
Presidents, but except for being invited once to lunch by Mr. [John J.] McCloy, I had no contact with&#13;
him and there was no reason at all why he should know me. It's really Black, Woods and McNamara&#13;
that I worked under and who knew of my existence. If I put Garner in that group, it's not to equate&#13;
him with the Presidents but it's because during Mr. Black's regime Garner was the man who ran the&#13;
Bank on a day-to-day basis. He was the inside man while Black was the outside man.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Each of these men was different, with a different personality, and each left a different stamp on&#13;
the Bank. The Black period was the first real 13 years of the Bank, if you eliminate Mr. Meyer and&#13;
Mr. McCloy. How long was McCloy here? A year-and-a-half or two years?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Two years. I've always supposed that although Mr. Black served 13 years, he reaUy was&#13;
serving out the remainder of the McCloy 5-year period, so if you include Mr. McCloy's 2 years, then&#13;
Mr. Black's 15-year period ceased in 1962 when he stepped down as President. In other words, he&#13;
finished three full terms.&#13;
&amp;#12;DLAMOND                                             .45-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It makes no difference, certainly not to my point of view, which is that these were the&#13;
first years of the Bank, when the Bank was put on the map. Certainly not as it is today, in size and&#13;
impact, but nevertheless as a potent force to be reckoned with. And those years settled a great many&#13;
questions with respect to Bank policies and to Bank procedures. To the extent that Black was&#13;
President during all of this, it doesn't make any difference who originated the particular ideas during&#13;
his presidency, the departures, the procedures, the innovations. It happened under his leadership and&#13;
he should get the credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Black himself, it appears to me, was overwhelmingly interested in establishing the Bank's&#13;
reputation as a borrower. Some have called him a salesman, but he's the man whose personal interest,&#13;
devotion, and efforts made it possible for the Bank to develop the resources that it would need to carry&#13;
out its objectives. This was his great interest, what he devoted his time to. When he came in as&#13;
Executive Director, he began the process of making the Bank's paper eligible throughout the United&#13;
States and of putting the Bank in the bond markets of many European countries. He managed the&#13;
Bank's liabilities, and without the growth of liabilities on a sound basis there could not have been any&#13;
significant growth of assets. This is what I think of primarily as Black's contribution. His interest in the&#13;
liabilities side of the Bank should not blind us to other facts. He insisted on the highest standards of&#13;
staff performance, letting nothing precede that in priority; and he supported Garner's organizational&#13;
and procedural work. Thus he helped establish the Bank's high reputation for objectivity and&#13;
excellence. Nor should it blind us to the fact that experience developed Black himself into a respected&#13;
"development statesman", as he was sometimes called, who played a key role in such difficult and&#13;
crucial matters as the division of the Indus waters and the planning of the Aswan Dam and their&#13;
consequences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Personally I found him a very likeable person. He was courtly, patrician, Southern, kindly to his&#13;
staff. Mr. Garner, in his autobiography, refers to him as being very steely, steel-like. I don't know&#13;
whether this is true or not. I didn't see it in his relations with me. In his relations with outsiders, in&#13;
pursuing his objective of making the Bank a desirable borrower, he might very well have been. And in&#13;
his relations with clients he might have been.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMONDI&#13;
     I remember one story about him, by the way. I think it was he who told me this. In his first&#13;
 meeting with Mr. Horowitz, the Governor of the Bank of Israel--did I mention this last time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 OLIVER: The Horowitz Proposal? I don't think so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLMOND: No, not about the Horowitz proposal. Israel joined the Bank and Horowitz came to the&#13;
Bank to talk to Black about the Bank and Israel's prospects for loans. At the end of the meeting, Black&#13;
told me, "Horowitz said, 'Well, I'm glad we've had this meeting, because I see you really are running a&#13;
bank and you're behaving like a banker.'" Obviously he had acquired a much better idea of what the&#13;
World Bank was and what Israel could expect from it. I tell this story because there may have been, in&#13;
that talk, some of the steeliness that Garner refers to in Black. I remember that Black told me the&#13;
story with some relish.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Black is the only President to whose home I went socially. And I traveled with him several times.&#13;
It was, I guess, a sign of his courtliness and attitude towards staff that I got into that company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Can you comment as to whether or not the numbers of staff people who went with&#13;
Presidents on missions overseas was probably larger under Black than it was under Woods or&#13;
McNamara?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: I can't say; I have no idea. It's quite customary for a President to take one or more staff&#13;
members with him on an official trip.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That is my impression. He also took executive directors occasionally with him, did he not?&#13;
Did Black?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I don't know. It's quite possible. Somehow or other, I would associate this much more&#13;
with the later Presidents. Black had some peculiarities, as you no doubt know. When he traveled, he&#13;
carried his own coffee and coffee-maker. And he usually carried his own water. After a two-and-a-half&#13;
or three-month stint in Thailand, I was to meet Black in Cairo. I was coming from Thailand and he was&#13;
&amp;#12;DIAMOND                                            -47-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[DIAMOND]&#13;
coming from elsewhere in the Middle East. I stopped a day or two in Beirut, for a plane connection to&#13;
Cairo. I was to be Black's guide, first in Ethiopia and then in Turkey. I was astonished to be awakened&#13;
early one morning in Beirut during my stopover by a telephone call from Baghdad or Damascus, where&#13;
Black and his group were. The call was from one of his entourage, who said, "We've run out of Evian,&#13;
and the electric coffee pot has blown. Would you please stock up on Evian or a reasonably accurate&#13;
facsimile thereof, and get us a coffee pot." The Evian was easy and I carried a dozen bottles to Cairo,&#13;
but it was not easy to find an electric coffee pot. I discovered one, however, at the home of my only&#13;
personal friend in Beirut, an American whom I had met in Turkey years before, and persuaded him to&#13;
sell it to me. I carried that also to Cairo for Black.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     On that trip, I remember walking with Mr.Black through the bazaar in Addis Ababa while he tried&#13;
to bargain for various items. One thing that caught his fancy was a Coptic amulet which he finally&#13;
negotiated for, brought it down by a few Ethiopian dollars, and kept it. It was a small leather square&#13;
with a Coptic saying sewn into it. From time to time you could see him, in years following, in his office&#13;
or at a Board meeting, pulling it out and fingering it. Whether he was asking for blessings in his&#13;
relations with the Board, or blessings to get through another Board meeting, I do not know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Garner was the person with whom I had the closest contact. I got to know him, to work with him,&#13;
quite well. One of the reasons probably was that Turkey was my country in several respects, and he&#13;
developed a tremendous interest in and affection for Turkey. I traveled with him in Turkey and in&#13;
Thailand, whereby hangs a tale of its own. Garner was very blunt, he was very straight, like George&#13;
Woods, and I'll mention this later on. He didn't suffer fools gladly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Although he is thought of as the flag-bearer of private enterprise, he presided over the initiation&#13;
and the carrying out of the general survey missions which stressed planning, but planning only of a&#13;
certain kind, of course. He was also a very strong supporter of the EDI. It was the EDI as an&#13;
instrument for upgrading the management of government in the developing countries. However&#13;
ideological he might have sounded in speech, my impression was that he wasn't all that ideological in&#13;
the way in which he actually behaved; he was quite pragmatic. I found him a very appealing person.&#13;

All of his qualities reflecting prejudice appear in his autobiography, which I lent to you. Because&#13;
they're concentrated in the book, they will impress you more than if you had worked with him.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      I can tell you one story which reflects on the character of both Black and Garner in their&#13;
relationship with a junior like me. At one point after a visit to Turkey, I was in Paris at the time Black&#13;
was there. This was pure coincidence. Black called me to his office and said he wanted to ask me&#13;
something about Turkey. He asked about a particular man whom I had met in Ankara, a man who&#13;
held a very important position in an embassy, with whom I had had a lot of contact. He asked what I&#13;
thought of this man. I know him to this day, and he's an extremely nice fellow, but I never heard&#13;
anybody praise his competence in those days. I so told Black. We talked about this a little while. Then&#13;
Black said to me, "Thank you very much. I've decided not to hire him as a result of this talk.' I asked&#13;
what he meant. He said the man had been proposed for a senior place on the Bank staff, and what I&#13;
had reported was enough to persuade him to turn the man down.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Two or three weeks later, back in Washington, Garner called me into his office and he said he&#13;
knew about my conversation in Paris with Black. It was he, Garner said, who proposed the man to&#13;
Black and he wanted me to know that, while not in agreement with my judgement, he would not hold&#13;
my recommendation against me. And he didn't. This incident made absolutely no difference in our&#13;
relationship. I think the incident is a sign of what these two men were like. I feel that Garner is&#13;
someone who has not been done full justice in the histories of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     We come to Woods. I found him a very intelligent man. Compared to Black he was gruLff and&#13;
blunt, calling a spade a spade. Also, like Garner, not suffering fools gladly, saying precisely what he&#13;
meant, and it sometimes came out in a way that developed tensions between him and the listener. He&#13;
obviously didn't come from the courtly South but from--was it Brooklyn?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -49-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 DIAMOND: From the streets of Brooklyn. I could relate to this. I'm not from New York but I also&#13;
 came from the city streets. It wasn't difficult for me to see that under this gruffness and bluntness&#13;
there was a warm and friendly person. I never saw Woods socially, as I did Black. Whether his&#13;
gruffness was the result of where he came from, or whether it was a deliberate effort to distance&#13;
himself from staff, the better to exercise an independent judgment on their recommendations, I don't&#13;
know. I found him very much worth knowing. And I find--looking back on it now, I don't quite recall&#13;
what I thought at that time--that his was a period of considerable innovation in the Bank's work. He&#13;
brought to the Bank not only a hard-nosed Wall Street approach but also, I think, a considerable sense&#13;
of motivation, maybe more than Black, certainly more than Black in his early years, a motivation with&#13;
respect to the underlying mission of the Bank. I say the early years because Black in his later years also&#13;
became, how shall I put it, a statesman for the Third World. Wasn't there a book of his called The&#13;
Story of Two Continents? Some interesting cases in Latin America and Asia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Development Diplomacv was his major work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: And Development Diplomacv was another, you're quite right. For the moment I had&#13;
forgotten about that one. So I have no doubt that Black's motivations changed. Woods was perhaps&#13;
neglected, certainly not appreciated, in spite of contributions to the Bank, maybe in part because of the&#13;
gruffness. Maybe it was also because his five years, sandwiched between the big McNamara and the&#13;
big Black, big in terms of time, were marred by some spectacular problems. One was the changed&#13;
attitude, especially in the United States, towards foreign aid. He had to struggle against the&#13;
environment for aid in a way in which Black didn't have to, and got himself thoroughly tangled up in&#13;
this horrible problem of the Second IDA Replenishment. I suspect that not unrelated to this was his&#13;
innovative emphasis on in the economic work of the Bank and also his call, in his last year I guess it&#13;
was, for the Grand Assize which led to the Pearson Commission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But the second big issue that affected him was his relations with the Board, which got to be quite&#13;
miserable. Maybe one explanation is that Black really didn't give a damn for the Board, so he could let&#13;
them say anything they wanted to say and would then go his own way; and Woods had to give a damn&#13;
about the Board because of IDA and therefore couldn't let Board members get away with anything he&#13;
disagreed with. Another factor may have been Woods' illness.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, before IDA, the Bank staff depended less upon the reactions of governments,&#13;
including the executive directors, since new money was not being made available, so to speak. Whereas&#13;
after IDA the governments began to be a great deal more important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLMOND: I've heard--I don't know if I heard this myself or whether somebody told me--that Woods&#13;
said that, when he accepted the presidency of the Bank, had he realized that he would be spending so&#13;
much of his time and energy persuading governments to put up money, he would never have accepted&#13;
the position. Of course, it wasn't money for the Bank, it was money for IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And the money for the Bank was Black's money in a way since he had raised it by selling&#13;
bonds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That's right. The point is that Black established the Bank as a prime borrower and&#13;
Woods could cash in on that, which leads me to an overall characterization, no doubt an&#13;
oversimplification. I said Woods was innovative. I would like to add that, whereas Black was the great&#13;
developer of the Bank's liabilities, the man who developed the resources, Woods was much more&#13;
interested in their allocation. His ianovative activities were primarily related to how the resources were&#13;
to be used, in pursuit of the Bank's objectives. He expanded the Bank's horizons. He pioneered the&#13;
Bank's entry into agriculture, education, health. The new emphasis on economic work was related to&#13;
this; developing country knowledge and country programs was essential to broader, more effective use&#13;
of the Bank's and IDA's resources. In addition, he was very much involved in what I called, earlier, a&#13;
relaunching, a new take-off for IFC: by the transfer of industry work to IFC, by the new emphasis on&#13;
development banks, and by making new resources available to IFC. One can argue about whether IFC&#13;
should have borrowed from the Bank or should have borrowed directly from the public, as some have&#13;
always wanted and as IFC is now doing. But the fact is he felt that IFC as a $15 or $20 million per year&#13;
institution didn't make any difference in the world. Before he left it was up to $60 or $70 million and&#13;
within a year thereafter it was at $100 million, which meant that IFC could begin to visualize an&#13;
effective future.&#13;

     These I feel are the important points. I don't need to elaborate on the others. I've previously&#13;
referred to the coordinating role of the Bank. Anyway, we're talking now about personalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I think I've responded to one of your earlier questions that you put to me the other day. why did I&#13;
feel closer to Garner and Woods, despite the fact that I had a warmer, more personal relationship with&#13;
Black? My comments have probably given you the flavor of my feelings. Whether they say anything&#13;
about them or say somethipg only about me, is for you to decide.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think it says a good deal about both. Very useful discussion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: On the third President I must comment on, Mr. McNamara, I don't really have much to&#13;
say. He was very different. He inherited a going institution. He certainly changed the Bank from a&#13;
low-keyed institution to a very high-keyed one, from a low profile to a high profile, and made it count&#13;
in the world in a way in which it hadn't counted before. I think one should deduct from his credits&#13;
some of the innovations in the use of resources attributed to him and push them back earlier, into&#13;
Woods' period and maybe even beginning in Black's. But he gave them the big shove. It almost seems&#13;
as though--I know this isn't true--almost as though bigness became a thing in itself. Maybe he never&#13;
read Brandeis' book on the "curse of bigness." The Bank began, in his time, to suffer from that curse in&#13;
many ways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: By bigness I take it you refer both to the size of the staff and to the size of the lending and&#13;
concessionary aid-giving programs?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: All of this is wrapped together. It's this plus the point I made before, the underlying&#13;
conviction that the Bank can move the world. The Bank is influencing the world, and it's right that it&#13;
should; but one can take the view--I think legitimately--that there are limits to what an external&#13;
institution can reasonably expect to do in influencing and directing sovereign governments a long way&#13;
off. There are problems to which the computer can contribute, and the numbers can contribute. But&#13;
the most difficult things involved in moving governments are not the numbers; they're the attitudes, the&#13;
social structures,, the history, the culture.&#13;

    Mr. McNamara's a very strange man. I met with him quite frequently because he was my&#13;
 immediate boss. Despite his reputation as a digester and grinder-out of numbers, he was a very&#13;
 emotional man. He could weep for Mankind, with a capital "M." You know about his tears when he&#13;
 spoke several times at Annual Meetings, about poverty which, I'm quoting almost, "denies human&#13;
 beings their essential humanity." And he could weep for some individuals close to him. But one rarely&#13;
 saw signs of interest--in individual human beings. His interest in persons with a small "p"as opposed to&#13;
 people--mankind with the capital letter--seemed limited. He was a very macro man; size and scale&#13;
 were vital. It seems to me that he didn't see limits. Of course I may be wrong in thinking there are&#13;
limits. But he acted as though there were no limits to the Bank's capacity to know, and to use its&#13;
leverage. The Bank became a much bigger institution and the problems of managing it became more&#13;
and more complex McNamara established some of the trappings of collegiality, but from all I've&#13;
heard, these were only trappings. He wasn't all that collegial; he controlled. And yet, there's no&#13;
question at all but that he changed the World Bank, in some respects for the better; in other respects&#13;
one can argue that some of the changes have been for the worse.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: May I ask your opinion about the following? Some people in talking about the size of the&#13;
staff of the Bank point out that the staff has not increased per dollar of lending, and I often wondered&#13;
whether this is a relevant comparison. The case might be made, on the other hand, that the Bank has&#13;
been in this business of making loans, evaluating projects, for a very long time. While the size of the&#13;
loans might be expected to increase with inflation, with a better understanding of countries, with an&#13;
increase in absorptive capacity, the size of the staff need not necessarily increase pai pass with the&#13;
increase in dollar lending since the staff might be expected to take on a larger dollar volume with&#13;
essentially the same size personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I must say, Mr. Oliver, that that latter view sounds plausible. I would not like to&#13;
compare the number of staff per dollar, or per hundred million dollars. I don't know the facts, and I'm&#13;
mot sure that ratio is entirely relevant or useful. A lot of factors come into play which that ratio may&#13;
not fully capture, such as staff knowledge and experience, efficiency of older staff, rapid expansion of&#13;
inexperienced staff, etcetera. On the other hand the so-called newer sectors into which the Bank&#13;
moved were much more difficult to deal with. Dealing with a hydroelectric plant, deciding on&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 [DLAMOND]&#13;
making a loan to it and supervising it, is quite different from deciding on a water supply project serving&#13;
500 villages, or in laying oit and supervising a program for increasing agricultural credits, even though&#13;
the amount of money may be the same. So I see a lot of factors entering into the ratios you mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I understand. Well, are there any questions that I should have asked?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Me and my, quote, "career," unquote, in the Bank Group, which you asked about some&#13;
days ago. In one sense, as an employee, it lasted 30 years, six months and three weeks. In another&#13;
sense it's still going on, since I retain my interest, my connections and my friends and I continue to&#13;
work for the Group, on and off. So it's clear that it must have been a very, very satisfying experience&#13;
for me, overall. As I mentioned to you the other day, I never thought that I would be in the Group that&#13;
long. I expected this to be a temporary job. I expected to go back to the career for which I had&#13;
planned, being a teacher of history, a researcher and a writer of scholarly articles and books.&#13;
                                                                                                             S&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I might add at this point, by the way, that the Bank in its early years also thought of itself as a&#13;
temporary institution. We were a safe bridge for those years until the private market and the private&#13;
sector could take it over. This was the view of the Management. I don't know when it dawned on&#13;
people that the Bank was not an interim affair.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: If I might suggest, it must have been by 1957, when discussions began about IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It could well be.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But it's certainly true. I've heard many people say that Mr. McCloy himself expressed the&#13;
opinion that 20 years at the outside would be a lifetime for the Bank, for the reasons you mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Just another sidelight on myself I mentioned earlier that, during these years when I&#13;
thought I was temporary and that I would go back, I held on to but did not use my grant from the&#13;
&amp;#12; DLAMOND                                            -54-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMONDJ&#13;
 Social Science Research Council. When the Bank instituted an insurance scheme for staff, I didn't go&#13;
 into it. I thought, what was the point of taking it? I kept my separate policy on the outside, which I had&#13;
 taken many years before, because I thought I'd have to convert anyway, in a few years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     This is relevant only in that it says working in the Group must have been a pretty satisfying&#13;
experience. It was. Why? Well, one had the feeling in 1947, 1948, 1950, that one was in at the creation&#13;
of something, at the beginning. Even EDIt which came along 10 years later, in 1956. Everything we&#13;
did, Alec Cairncross and John Adler and I, was brand new. There was nothing to copy fromn any&#13;
previous year; we created the courses, identified the readings, prepared the cases, and wrote the&#13;
outlines from scratch. There was the feeling of being present at the creation, to borrow Dean&#13;
Acheson's phrase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And there was a certain sense of mission here, a mission being carried out with what we thought&#13;
was hard-nosed means. The whole concept of appraisal and follow-up reflected that hard-nosed - -&#13;
approach. But the fact is, it was a mission. In recent years maybe the sense of mission has increased&#13;
and the hard-nosedness part may well have declined. At least, the balance has changed. But the&#13;
combination of these two elements was attractive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I found the work extremely stimulating. I referred to myself at lunch the other day as an&#13;
international civil servant. You picked this up to comment on. The activity was related to the work of&#13;
a new breed of person, not,unique to the World Bank but the whole UN complex. Of course, I found&#13;
quite an unusual collection of people developing here. It wasn't here when I came, but it developed in&#13;
time. I guess that, as in any institution this size, a relatively small percentage of people do a relatively&#13;
large proportion of the work. The fact is, that as a whole, they were a very able and hard-working staff&#13;
and collegues. That, at least is what I recall about those I was closest to. Finally, I wouldn't like to say&#13;
that I wasn't affected by what I know affected others: there's a certain glamour and romance in the&#13;
travel and the other cultures and strange places. I couldn't have been immune to that. All these things&#13;
added together.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                           -55-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMONDI&#13;
      At the same time I can't hide that, from time to time, and especially in my last six or eight years as&#13;
 an active staff member, I had a sense of frustration or worse. But overall it was very satisfying and I&#13;
have at least a sense of having made a difference somehow. Not much of one, but a bit of one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     How? Well, if I look back over my years in the Bank, obviously the bulk of my time was spent&#13;
following intelligently--I hope--the guidelines and instructions that I was given, as any staff member was&#13;
given. But one place in which I think I might have made a difference was in the development of the&#13;
Bank's role in development finance companies. Not simply the Bank's role but, much more&#13;
importantly, in the role of development finance companies themselves around the developing world.&#13;
Because however great the difficulties which a good many of such institutions have experienced in&#13;
recent years, the fact is they've played a role in their countries and will continue to do so in somewhat&#13;
different guises in the years ahead. Like the World Bank, their roles have changed with the changing&#13;
environment, the changing times, and their activities have changed. I think I was of some significance&#13;
in this process; at least, I'd like to think so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIV1ER: Would you mind a comment from an outsider to the Bank on this issue?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It seems to me that you have participated in one of the really major innovations in the Bank,&#13;
which was to find ways of modifying what seemed to be the injunction of the framers of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement at Bretton Woods, that the Bank had to deal through governments, not only as guarantors&#13;
of bank loans but also as the recipients of the loans. The Bank is now able to deal directly with private&#13;
industry. It seems to me that is a major innovation in the history of the Bank and you were certainly a&#13;
pioneer, a major contributor. You and Robert Garner are the two major pioneers in this field, and I&#13;
think it was furthered by George Woods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Thanks, that's nice to hear.&#13;
&amp;#12; DIAMOND                                            -56-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 [DIAMOND]&#13;
     The second area in which I feel particularly pleased is EDI. I think I played a role in the creation&#13;
 of EDI under Alec's leadership and with John Adler's participation. I think the EDI has been a very,&#13;
very important part of the World Bank. It, too, has had a checkered career, as you well know. After its&#13;
early years, it has become something quite different from what was originally intended. But the fact is&#13;
that it has made a contribution to raising the level of economic management in the developing world.&#13;
It has had an impact not only directly but through offshoots, in the sense of the training programs it has&#13;
promoted and assisted in the development of over the years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Which reminds me of a little story about Garner, again reflecting the man. I had met Alec&#13;
Cairncross and been interviewed by him twice when he was brought over to think about whether the&#13;
World Bank should establish a training center. this. We hit it off, that was that, and I forgot about it.&#13;
But it was in Bangkok, in a cab one day, that Garner said to me, "Bill, we've decided to go ahead with&#13;
establishing the Economic Development Institute. Would you be interested in joining the staff?' And I&#13;
said, "Why me?" And he said, "Because Alec has asked for you. He's asked for two people, John Adler&#13;
and you." And I said, 'I'm delighted to hear that and I'm interested'. "But", I added, "frankly, the one&#13;
thing I want to know is, where do you stand? Do you really feel that the EDI has something to&#13;
contribute? Is it going to have the support of management and is it going to have the support of you in&#13;
particular?" And he said "Without any doubt. We want it, I want it, I will assist it in every way. This&#13;
will be an important part of the Bank and I'm fully behind it." I said that, in that case, I could at once&#13;
say that I was ready to join EDI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The fact is, Gamer did participate. He did support it and he did participate, even in a way in&#13;
which Black did not. I can't speak of the Presidents after Black because I was out of EDI. Black came&#13;
once a year, every year, not only in my three years but for a few years thereafter at least, to address the&#13;
participants in the evenings. But Garner ran a seminar. He sat up in front of the group as I did or&#13;
Alec, or a member of the Bank staff. His subject, by the way, was management. But I mention this not&#13;
just because it was an exciting seminar but because it reflected his interest in EDI.&#13;
&amp;#12;DIAMOND                                            -57-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[DIAMOND]&#13;
     There's a third area--maybe I'm stretching for this one. I think that I was the first person who was&#13;
given a year's leave of absence to work for a member country. I was told that there was a lot of soul&#13;
searching in the Bank as to whether it wanted to send staff to member countries, and that the matter&#13;
was discussed informally with the Board of Directors. Within two months after I joined the Bank I was&#13;
asked by the U.S. Government to become one of a team of three persons to help control all imports&#13;
into Greece, except military. This was to assist Greece during the worst period of post-war insurgency.&#13;
I was given leave, went to Athens, and became a Greek civil servant by special act of the Greek&#13;
Parliament. Since then, the Bank's advisory role had become of tremendous importance and the bill&#13;
for 'services to member countries" has become very great; its staff members have been seconded to, or&#13;
given leave to assist, members countries very often. If it's so that my assignment was a first and opened&#13;
the way for Bank activity of a new and very important kind, then I feel that this, too, was a contribution,&#13;
however inadvertent it may have been, both on my part and on the Bank's.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I'd like to speak of IFC; but here I'm afraid that, aside from the development bank work I've&#13;
discussed already, I would really be talking about what IFC did for me rather than what I did for IFC.&#13;
So I won't mention it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So there are two, maybe three, things I've left behind. I should add that I guess I was lucky to have&#13;
come into the Bank when I did. I'm not sure that I would be acceptible now, with a Ph.D. in an&#13;
unwanted subject-- history--and only five years of prior work experience. Nor would my interest be as&#13;
great in the Bank itself--in IFC, yes--because the sense of newness, the sense of personally making a&#13;
difference, can't possibly be the same in an institution of 6,000 with 30 years of experience as it was in a&#13;
new instituion of 200, which was roughly the size when I came in. Also the constraints today are so&#13;
much greater than they were in the first years of the Bank: the external constraints both in terms of&#13;
greater pressure from a much larger constituency of developing countries and of a more limited one in&#13;
the advanced world, and the internal constraints implicit in size and bureaucracy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    That's it.&#13;

OLIVER: Well, sir, it's been a fascinating conversation, interview. It is the longest one I've had the&#13;
opportunity of doing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DLAMOND: That's my fault, not yours.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: No, I think it is because you have had experiences that others are going to be very interested&#13;
in learning about. I appreciate your time ever so much and appreciate the extent to which you have&#13;
prepared notes to make sure we have covered the major topics. Thank you very much.&#13;
