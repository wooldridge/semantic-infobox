I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A.   BANK INVOLVEMENT IN ENERGY&#13;
1.    The Bank has been heavily involved in the energy sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the&#13;
past, notably in electric power, petroleum and natural gas. In the gas sector, the Bank financed the&#13;
Naftagas Pipeline Project (Loan 916-YU; US$59.4 million; 1973) and the Sarajevo Air Pollution&#13;
Control Project (Loan 1264-YU; US$38 million; 1975). Power sector projects, which benefited&#13;
BH partly or exclusively, included: the Third Power Project (Loan 386-YU; US$75 million; 1972)&#13;
and the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1469-YU; US$80 million; 1977), both of which helped&#13;
finance the development of SFRY's interconnected power system; the Fifth Power Project (Loan&#13;
1561-YU; US$73 million; 1978), which was for the development of the hydro power plants on&#13;
the middle Neretva River; the Sixth Power Project (Loan 1561-1-YU; US$61 million; 1983),&#13;
which was for construction of the Mostar dam; the Seventh Power Project (Loan 2338-YU;&#13;
US$120 million; 1984), which financed SFRY's energy management system; and the Eighth&#13;
Power Project, which was for the Visegrad hydropower plant (Loan 2527-YU; US$125 million;&#13;
1985). In the petroleum sector, the Bank financed the First Petroleum Project (Loan 2597-YU;&#13;
US$92.5 million; 1985) for the development of indigenous energy resources. Since the Bank&#13;
resumed lending to Bosnia in 1996, a US$20 million Trust Fund credit was approved on May 14,&#13;
1996 for an Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project (TF 024034) and a US$35&#13;
million IDA credit for an Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project with a coal mining&#13;
component was approved on July 31, 1996 (Credit 2903-BOS).&#13;
B.   ELECTRIC POWER&#13;
2.    Background. In 1990, BH produced 13,090 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity from&#13;
generating plants located on its territory. Electricity consumption was 11,181 GWh. The system&#13;
comprised 13 hydropower plants with a total capacity of 2,034 Megawatts (MW) and an average&#13;
output of 6,922 GWh/year (2,415 GWh in 1990), and 12 thermal power plants with a total&#13;
capacity of 1,957 Megawatts (MW) and an output of 10,675 GWh in 1990. The thermal power&#13;
plants were brown coal and lignite fired, with the fuel coming from mines within BH. BH was&#13;
responsible for operating its own system and meeting local demand. However, being part of the&#13;
former Yugoslav network, the 400 kV power grid in BH was controlled by JUGEL's dispatching&#13;
center in Belgrade. Power exchanges with neighboring countries were also controlled by JUGEL.&#13;
3.    As of January 1, 1996, 58%  of total generating capacity in the Federation area&#13;
(comparable data are not available for Republika Srpska) was reported to have been damaged.&#13;
Part of the remaining capacity is out of operation due to destroyed transmission lines or lack of&#13;
coal. About 60% of the transmission network and control system was seriously damaged,&#13;
including transmission facilities and interconnection lines to neighboring countries.  The&#13;
distribution  network  was largely  destroyed.   Many transformer stations, buildings,&#13;
telecommunications and maintenance equipment were also either seriously damaged or destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
4.    Sector Strategy.    The proposed sector strategy would be to: (i) restore service to&#13;
acceptable levels; (ii) reconfigure the electric power network to optimize the system, taking into&#13;
account BH's need for significant independence from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's (FRY)&#13;
network and its security of supply; (iii) restructure the sector and introduce a regulatory&#13;
framework that would facilitate attracting potential investors; and (iv) improve sector finances by&#13;
improving billing and collections and revising the tariff structure and levels to reflect supply costs&#13;
for each category of consumers. An Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project was&#13;
approved by the Board of Directors on July 31, 1996.&#13;
C.    COAL&#13;
5.    Background. In the 1980's, the coal mines in BH produced annually about 18 million&#13;
tons, of which 10 million tons of brown coal and 8 million tons of lignite. Their brown coal&#13;
output accounted for about 80% of total former SFRY production, lignite for only 15%.&#13;
Production was concentrated in areas near Tuzla and Zenica in both open pit as well as&#13;
underground mines. In addition, two rnines in the Republika Srpska were important: Ugljevik:&#13;
(brown coal) and Gacko (lignite). About half of the production originated from surface mines and&#13;
the other half from underground mines. BH's proven reserves of coal are about 1.6 billion tons.&#13;
More than 80% of BH's total production was used for electric power generation and the&#13;
remaining 20% for industrial and household uses.&#13;
6.    Coal production dropped to 1.5 million tons in 1994, i.e., less than 10% of the pre-war&#13;
level. Much of the mobile mining equipment has been cannibalized beyond repair. Some newer&#13;
mobile equipment had to be turned over to the army or just disappeared. There is an acute lack of&#13;
critical materials such as fuel, tires and spare parts. Yet, despite the drastic drop in production, no&#13;
efforts were made to concentrate production in a few large and economic mines. The number of&#13;
people employed decreased from 26,000 to about 7,000. Since production declined much faster,&#13;
productivity is now among the lowest in the world. Present production costs appear to be at or&#13;
above the world market level of coal prices adjusted for quality and are higher than sales prices,&#13;
which are set by the State. To ensure future financial viability, coal mining enterprises need to&#13;
close uneconomic capacity.&#13;
7.    Sector Strategy. In view of the coal sector's uncertain future in a market economy, all&#13;
major long-term investment decisions should be avoided at this stage. The sector strategy is to:&#13;
(i) determine priority actions to be taken for the lowest cost and most competitive mines&#13;
necessary to provide fuel to cogenerating plants and other priority users; (ii) restore output of the&#13;
lowest-cost mines to minimum acceptable levels; and (iii) restructure the coal industry, including&#13;
closing uneconomic mining capacity and privatizing services wherever feasible.&#13;
D.   DISTRcT HEATING&#13;
8.    Background. In 1991, BH had district heating (DH) systems in most major towns and&#13;
cities with a population in excess of about 25,000 inhabitants. The systems were generally run by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
municipally-owned district heating enterprises (DHEs). Cogenerated heat was provided only by&#13;
the combined heat and power plants in Tuzla and Kakanj as well as by local industries; the&#13;
remaining heat was generated by local heat-only boilers. Prior to the war, some efforts had been&#13;
made to start converting coal-fired boilers to gas or oil firing, notably in Sarajevo. DH systems&#13;
throughout BH served 120,000 flats, equivalent to 450,000 inhabitants or 10% of the total&#13;
population.  The Sarajevo DH system was the country's largest, serving about 180,000&#13;
inhabitants or 45% of the pre-war population of Sarajevo.&#13;
9.    Currently, the DH systems in major cities such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Bihac and Mostar&#13;
are only partly operational. In Sarajevo, the system has been damaged due to shelling and&#13;
freezing of the pipes in the network; building internals in residential dwellings (pipes, radiators&#13;
and valves) have incurred substantial damage, also due to the corrosion associated with non-usage&#13;
of the system. In cities such as Banja Luka, most of the damage is related to non-usage of the&#13;
system due to lack of fuel, and associated rusting and freezing. In all cities, lack of maintenance&#13;
due to the absence of spare parts has been significant and further aggravated the problems.&#13;
10.   Sector Strategy. The sector strategy is to: (i) restore urban district heating services to&#13;
adequate levels as soon as possible, disconnect serviced flats from the gas system (in Sarajevo)&#13;
and reduce fuel wood consumption (in other cities); (ii) rehabilitate building internal heating&#13;
installations; (iii) strengthen sector institutions and increase cost recovery; and (iv) undertake&#13;
master plan studies to prepare plans for the optimal configuration of each city's future heating&#13;
system. An Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project was approved by the Board of&#13;
Directors on May 14, 1996 (TF 024034); implementation is fully satisfactory.&#13;
E.    NATURAL GAS&#13;
11.   Background. The gas system in BH was developed starting in 1975 under the Bank's&#13;
Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project (Loan 1264-YU; US$38 million). Russian gas is supplied&#13;
via Hungary and Serbia and enters BH at Zvornik, in Republika Srpska. As of 1992 the gas&#13;
supply network consisted of 182 km of transmission mains and offiake pipes, running from&#13;
Zvornik to the Sarajevo area via Semizovac and from the latter to Zenica. Consumption peaked&#13;
in 1990 with 610 million cubic meters, constituting 8% of the total energy consumption in BH.&#13;
Within Sarajevo, there were 15,000 household connections and all major boilers of the city's&#13;
district heating network had been converted from coal to gas-firing. Gas imports for BH are&#13;
metered at the Ukraine/Hungarian border (Beregov, the contractual point of delivery of the gas)&#13;
and from there it is transported through the Hungarian and FRY transmission systems to Zvornik.&#13;
The gas was imported under a contract between Energopetrol, a state-owned oil and gas&#13;
company, and Gazexport, the export branch of Russia's Gazprom. Within BH, gas transmission&#13;
and distribution was the responsibility of Sarajevogas (para. 27).&#13;
12.   At the beginning of the war, use of gas upstream reduced the supply coming into Sarajevo&#13;
to such an extent that gas use for industry and much of the district heating system became&#13;
impossible. Because of the destruction of part of the district heating system in Sarajevo early on&#13;
and a sharp reduction in electricity supply, gas suddenly assumed major importance for the&#13;
inhabitants of Sarajevo as a means to stay warm and to cook. Many improvised connections and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
appliances were made which, combined with an absence of odorization, often led to explosions&#13;
and highly inefficient gas use. However, odorization equipment was reintroduced in December&#13;
1995 through humanitarian aid. As of the end of 1995, the total number of household&#13;
connections in all of Sarajevo was estimated at around 89,000; gas consumption constituted about&#13;
70% of all energy consumption and it was the basic heating and cooking fuel for the city's&#13;
remaining 300,000 inhabitants.&#13;
13.   Debt to Gazexport. During the war, the gas supply from Semizovac to Zenica (the entire&#13;
western branch of the transmission system, affecting several major industries along that line) was&#13;
shut off. However, some gas was allowed to come into Sarajevo. In exchange, gas was allowed&#13;
to go to FRY. The total bill for gas supplied to BH by Gazexport during the war was about&#13;
US$105 million as of October 10, 1995. Settlement of the debt outstanding as of October 10,&#13;
1995 is expected to take place as part of the commercial debt negotiations. A new interim&#13;
contract for the period October 10, 1995-December 31, 1996 signed between Gazexport and&#13;
Energoinvest called for delivery of gas to both the Federation and the Republika Srpska&#13;
combined.&#13;
14.   Agreement was reached in January 1997 on a new three-year gas supply contract.&#13;
However, Gazexport was insisting on prior payment of an unpaid balance of US$16.2 million&#13;
under the October 1995 contract before the new contract could become effective. In fact, due to&#13;
continuing payment problems the gas supply to BH was gradually reduced and finally cut off on&#13;
April 1, 1997. Since the major issue was a dispute between the Federation and RS about their&#13;
respective shares of the arrears, the Bank mounted a major effort to resolve these differences. As&#13;
a result, the Federation and RS agreed to an arrears settlement scheme' as well as to the need to&#13;
renegotiate the existing gas supply and transit agreements in order to have a separate agreement&#13;
for each Entity. This would ensure that, in the event one of the two parties defaults on its&#13;
payments to Gazexport or the transit companies (MOL of Hungary and Nis-Gas of Yugoslavia),&#13;
the supply of gas to the other party could be maintained. The Federation settled all its arrears to&#13;
Gazexport and the flow of gas to the Federation resumed on October 31, 1997. The resupply of&#13;
gas to RS will take place once it has come to a satisfactory agreement with Gazexport on arrears&#13;
repayment and payment for future consumption (the humanitarian need for gas in RS is far less&#13;
critical than in Sarajevo: over 90% of the gas is consumed by an alumina factory and most&#13;
inhabitants using gas have alternative means of heating).&#13;
II. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
15.   The conclusion of the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement in December 1995 ended Europe's&#13;
most destructive war of the last fifty years. It was the first step towards reconciliation and&#13;
reconstruction for Bosnia and Herzegovina, a task whose outcome could make or break the peace&#13;
process. Large numbers of refugees and displaced persons, severely damaged infrastructure&#13;
IThe Federation agreed to pay US$7.3 million, of which the Dutch Trust Fund paid US$4.7 million, while RS&#13;
agreed to pay US8.9 million. Efforts are underway to obtain donor financing to help RS settle its arrears with&#13;
Gazexport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-     ~~5&#13;
facilities, and lack of a unified economic management structure make for an unparalleled challenge&#13;
for post-war reconstruction.&#13;
16.   Loss in human resources and damages. At least 200-250,000 people are dead or&#13;
missing, and over 1 million people left the country. In addition, there are about 1.5 million&#13;
displaced people in the country, many of whom live in temporary shelters. Enormous damage has&#13;
been inflicted on the country's physical infrastructure, including energy. Direct war damages are&#13;
huge, probably in the range of US$15-20 billion. Indirect damage due to lack of maintenance and&#13;
corrosion accounts for many more billions of dollars of losses.&#13;
17.   Institutional Framework. Under the Dayton-Paris Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
is an internationally recognized country consisting of two entities: the Bosniac-Croat Federation&#13;
(Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and the Republika Srpska. There is a State Government&#13;
responsible for foreign affairs, customs and foreign trade policies, monetary management, and&#13;
inter-entity matters on communication, transport. All other responsibilities including defense,&#13;
energy, social services and social welfare, have been devolved to the Federation and the&#13;
Republika Srpska separately.&#13;
18.   Macroeconomic Setting.  Since the signing of the Peace Agreement, Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina has experienced the beginnings of political, economic and social recovery. While&#13;
living standards are still very low for many Bosnian families and economic activity is only at about&#13;
one-third of prewar levels, the reconstruction effort has already borne significant fruit. Economic&#13;
growth in 1996 reached 50 percent. Unemployment has declined from its postwar high of 90&#13;
percent to well below 50 percent. Many schools and health clinics have reopened, repairs to&#13;
infrastructure are well underway. Commerce and production are picking up with the help of&#13;
donor-financed lines of credit. The effects of reconstruction and growth are particularly evident&#13;
in the Bosniac/Croat Federation where much of the international aid has been directed. Recovery&#13;
in Republika Srpska began only after international sanctions were lifted in March 1996, and has&#13;
been proceeding at a slower pace than in the Federation.&#13;
A.   BANK/IDA ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
19.   On April 1, 1996, Bosnia and Herzegovina fulfilled the conditions of succession to the&#13;
former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's membership in the Bank, IDA and IFC.&#13;
Membership is retroactive to February 25, 1993. The resolution of Bosnia's arrears with the&#13;
World Bank, through consolidation of its IBRD debt, allowed regular Bank lending to begin in&#13;
June 1996. With a war-devastated economy, low post-war per capita GDP and lack of&#13;
creditworthiness, Bosnia was declared IDA eligible.&#13;
20.   Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing, with the BH&#13;
authorities, a blueprint for reconstruction of the country's economy. A three- to four-year&#13;
Priority Reconstruction Program totaling some $5.1 billion was presented to, and endorsed by a&#13;
donors' conference co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU, following signing of the Dayton-Paris&#13;
Peace Accords in December 1995. This conference, and a second one in April 1996, led to 1996&#13;
commitments of about US$1.8 billion from some sixty bilateral and multilateral donors for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
immediate and priority reconstruction activities. A third donors' conference held in July 1997&#13;
secured additional donor commitments of US$1.2 billion for 1997.&#13;
21.   During 1996, the Bank followed an assistance strategy aimed at jump-starting economic&#13;
activity through support of a broad range of economic sectors. Leveraging Bank resources with&#13;
significant funding from donors was an important element of this strategy. Before arrears&#13;
resolution, the Bank supported a series of immediate assistance programs through a special $150&#13;
million Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina (TFBH). Seven emergency operations were&#13;
approved under the TFBH, including rebuilding of government institutions and funding of a line&#13;
of credit to small business, as well as support for rehabilitation in the agriculture, water and&#13;
sanitation, transport, health, education and district heating sectors.&#13;
22.   Since the start of regular Bank lending in mid-1996, US$257.6 million in IDA resources&#13;
have been committed, supporting an additional 13 operations focused on clearing of landmines,&#13;
reconstruction of electric power, transport infrastructure, housing, hospitals and schools,&#13;
establishment of a guarantee facility for industry, and three programs to support recovery of&#13;
employment through public works, re-training and loans to microbusinesses. IDA's assistance&#13;
program also supported the initial phase of the government's macroeconomic and institutional&#13;
reforms: a Transition Assistance Credit, approved by the Board in September 1996, was the first&#13;
operation focusing on institution-building in the Federation and a series of structural reforms&#13;
needed for advancing the transition to a market-economy; and under the Second Transport&#13;
Project, approved by the Board in August 1997, an adjustment component supports similar key&#13;
structural reforms in the RS. The IFC has pending commitments of about US$10.7 million to&#13;
various small and medium sized enterprise projects.&#13;
23.   While emphasis during the first post-war year was on moving quickly with emergency&#13;
reconstruction across a range of sectors, IDA's assistance strategy for fiscal years 1998 and 1999&#13;
shifts the focus to sustainability and ensuring the medium- to long- term viability of policies and&#13;
investments. Significant donor resources are needed for the next several years; however, BH&#13;
must increasingly become more self-reliant in preparation for the time when these inflows are no&#13;
longer available. This will mean viable government institutions, sustainable government budgets,&#13;
improved cost-recovery policies and mechanisms and structural reforms that stimulate private&#13;
investment.  Three overarching objectives will guide Bank Group strategy: (i) further&#13;
development of the basic institutional infrastructure for economic management; (ii) transition to a&#13;
market economy through deepening of major structural reforms; and (iii) continued, selective&#13;
support of physical reconstruction.&#13;
24.   Further policy-enhancing investment or adjustment operations are envisaged to support&#13;
institution-building at the State and Entity level, as well as key reforms in the areas of public&#13;
finance, banking, privatization and trade liberalization. In the area of reconstruction, future Bank&#13;
operations will support key areas such as the network infrastructure sectors of energy and&#13;
transport, as well as education, agriculture and other sectors essential to economic recovery.&#13;
Limited IDA resources will continue to make partnerships with other donors essential:&#13;
Mobilizing co-funding for future operations, and coordinating strategies -- e.g., eventual exit from&#13;
those sectors where other donors are more fully engaged or have greater comparative advantage -&#13;
- will be important elements of this partnership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
25.   Project Specific. The Bank delayed processing of the proposed Project because the&#13;
supply of gas to Sarajevo remained tenuous and was, in fact, cut off by Gazexport starting on&#13;
April 1, 1997. The Bank took the position that, as long as there was no sound long-term gas&#13;
supply contract with credible payment mechanisms, it could not make major investments in the&#13;
urgently needed reconfiguration and reconstruction of the Sarajevo gas distribution system and&#13;
associated transmission facilities. Nevertheless, the Bank allowed Sarajevogas to withdraw about&#13;
US$5 million against the Project's US$6 million Project Start-up Advance (para. 65) for urgent&#13;
requirements, notably for purchasing regulators and meters necessary for the district heating&#13;
system's boilers as well as for rehabilitating, procuring and installing household meters and&#13;
regulator sets.&#13;
26.   When it became clear that the gas supply to Bosnia would not be restored unless the&#13;
Federation and RS would be separately responsible for their respective consumption, the Bank&#13;
took an active role in convincing all parties, both within and without BH, that there should be&#13;
separate contracts throughout the gas supply chain for the Federation and RS (para. 14). The&#13;
Bank was also instrumental in brokering agreement on the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
pipeline section within RS, with transit fees to be paid by Energoinvest to Energopetrol Pale.&#13;
Commercial meters were installed on the main pipeline in Zvornik in February 1997 and&#13;
Energoinvest will have free and unhindered access to these meters. Under the project, existing&#13;
control meters in Kladanj will be replaced by commercial meters with greater accuracy, so that&#13;
future disputes about respective shares of gas consumption should no longer arise. Separate&#13;
valves on the pipeline at Zvomik would ensure that the supply to either party could be cut off at&#13;
the request of the gas supplier or the transit companies in case of payment default.&#13;
III. THE GAS SYSTEM&#13;
A.   SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
27.   The gas system in Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of transmission and distribution&#13;
systems. The transmission pipeline system imports gas from Russia. From Zvomik at the border&#13;
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and BH the main line extends in a&#13;
southwesterly direction to Sarajevo, entering the Federation at Kladanj. This line was constructed&#13;
in 1979 and is 117 km long. An additional line going in a northwesterly direction goes from&#13;
Sarajevo to Zenica. That line is approximately 65 km long and was constructed in 1982. Both&#13;
transmission lines supply consumers at various take-off points along their length. Prior to the war,&#13;
most of the gas was consumed by commercial and industrial customers in Sarajevo and industrial&#13;
consumers in Zenica and Kakanj. Both the transmission pipeline from Zvornik to Sarajevo and the&#13;
initial distribution system in Sarajevo were builtunder a World Bank loan (Loan 1264-YU; 1975).&#13;
The transmission line to Zenica was financed by the Zenica Steel Works.&#13;
28.   The main gas transmission pipeline was designed for a maximum volume of 1,260 million&#13;
cubic meters (MCM) per year. Consumption peaked in 1990, at 610 MCM per year. In 1992, the&#13;
flow to Zenica was shut off and the gas flow into Sarajevo was adequate to serve only small&#13;
commercial and residential consumers. The consumed gas volume in 1992 was only 125 MCM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
29.   The distribution system in Sarajevo was built from 1979 to 1982. Before the war, the&#13;
system supplied industry, district heating plants and about 15,000 individual households. Natural&#13;
gas is distributed in the city of Sarajevo and its suburbs at three working pressure levels: 8 bar, 3&#13;
bar and 0.1 bar. The 8 bar steel network for the high pressure loop line has a length of 80 km,&#13;
with a maximum working pressure of up to 14.5 bar. The regular network for the medium 3 bar&#13;
pressure loop line has a length of about 15 km and is made of a combination of polyethylene&#13;
(80%) and steel (20%) pipe. The maximum working pressure of this medium pressure network is&#13;
4 bar. The low pressure distribution network has a length of approximately 600 km and is made&#13;
entirely of polyethylene pipes. The material which has been used for the networks corresponds to&#13;
Western European standards.&#13;
B.    SYSTEM PROBLEMS&#13;
30.   Transmission System. The high pressure transmission lines and facilities transporting the&#13;
gas from the international border to the communities and industrial installations were not&#13;
maintained during the war. Hence, the safety and reliability of the transmission system has&#13;
deteriorated severely. A transmission line failure would stop the gas flow in the entire system.&#13;
The materials and equipment to repair a failure, should it occur, are not available. Severe&#13;
problems presently endangering the transmission system are: (i) possible bursting of the pipeline&#13;
due to damage from shelling, sniper fire and excessive loading from armoured military vehicles;&#13;
(ii) land movements, erosion and underminings at river and stream crossings; and (iii) external and&#13;
internal corrosion.&#13;
31.   Very little pipeline maintenance could be done during the war. Most of the maintenance&#13;
records of the pipeline were destroyed or lost, so that very little baseline data exists. Virtually all&#13;
equipment was lost. Spare parts must be made available for regular maintenance and repair. A&#13;
procurement, warehousing and spare parts policy needs to be developed based on the equipment&#13;
in the system. Pipe for line cut-outs and pipeline maintenance material needs to be procured and&#13;
warehoused in a suitable environment. However, stores and shelters that used to protect&#13;
mechanical equipment against weather impact suffered various degrees of damage during the war.&#13;
These structures, tools, spare parts, workshops or warehouse equipment required for mechanical&#13;
works need to be repaired.&#13;
32.   Distribution System. During the war, natural gas was the main source of energy in&#13;
Sarajevo, since oil, liquefied petroleum gas, electricity, coal and wood supplies quickly became&#13;
scarce or exhausted. Electricity was often cut off and the district heating systems that used to&#13;
supply densely populated parts of the city could operate only partly. To meet basic heating and&#13;
cooking requirements, the Sarajevo gas distribution system was expanded to a large number of&#13;
residences. Some of these connections were installed with the help of international humanitarian&#13;
aid organizations according to industry standards.  However, the vast majority of these&#13;
connections were made by unskilled labor with salvaged materials. Pressure regulating and&#13;
metering devices were not installed. Existing regulating and metering devices were often bypassed&#13;
or removed because of the low pressures in the distribution lines. Building internal installations for&#13;
district heating were cannibalized and converted into gas pipes. Hand-made burners and heaters&#13;
were installed without safety shut-off devices. These improvised connections and appliances,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
combined with an absence of gas odor, led to frequent explosions which resulted in fatalities,&#13;
injuries, and fires. However, gas odorization equipment was reinstalled in December 1995 and&#13;
the number of explosions declined sharply since.&#13;
33.   Current Situation. As of the end of 1995, gas consumption constituted about 70% of all&#13;
energy consumption and it was the basic heating and cooking fuel for the city's remaining&#13;
300,000 inhabitants. Since the beginning of the war, the network expanded from 15,000 to about&#13;
89,000 household connections. Approximately 22,000 of these installations have been normalized&#13;
to date, including exterior piping, meters and regulators. About 34,000 former district heating&#13;
customers were returned to the district heating system as a result of successful implementation of&#13;
the first phase of the Bank's Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project. The total&#13;
number of gas consumers was about 53,000 as of November, 1997.&#13;
34.   The self-made heating and cooking devices used by many consumers are quickly&#13;
deteriorating due to the inadequate materials and fabrication techniques used. Climatic exposure&#13;
and working stress make the materials brittle and prone to leaking, causing gas-related incidents&#13;
while the waste of gas through leaks continues. The handmade appliances are estimated to be up&#13;
to 50% less efficient than commercial appliances. Effective demand side management measures&#13;
require that this improvised equipmentbe replaced as soon as possible.&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
35.   The first objective of the project is to restore a safe and reliable gas supply to BH, in&#13;
particular to Sarajevo, as soon as possible, by repairing or reconstructing the gas transmission and&#13;
distribution systems. This includes rehabilitation of the transmission line, distribution network and&#13;
connections of large gas users, including Toplane, and reconnection of 34,000 flats to a&#13;
functioning district heating system (they have already been transferred). The remaining 3,000&#13;
connections would be taken off the system2. The second objective is to enhance system and&#13;
energy efficiency and reduce environmental pollution by converting self-made gas connections to&#13;
industry standards. This will include installing new meters and regulators on 42,000 connections,&#13;
repairing meters and regulators on the other connections and replacing home made heating and&#13;
cooking devices of low-income families with 10,000 simple wall heaters and two plate cookers.&#13;
Other objectives are to enhance cost recovery, strengthen the institutional capacity of&#13;
Sarajevogas, and identify alternative sources of gas supply. The project would include the repair&#13;
of transmission facilities within Republika Srpska.&#13;
These consumers cannot be served economically by the natural gas system and would have to use alternative fuels&#13;
for heating and cooking, such as LPG or electricity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
B.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
36.   Gas System Reconstruction To Date. Reconstruction prior to January 1996 consisted&#13;
of efforts by humanitarian aid organizations, with labor being supplied by Sarajevogas and the&#13;
citizens of the City. Relief projects were funded by several Middle Eastern countries, the UK, the&#13;
Netherlands and the US. Implementation was coordinated primarily through a British engineering&#13;
and construction company (AMEC) and Sarajevogas. These projects consisted of the&#13;
rehabilitation of about 10,000 self made connections and the installation of approximately 200 km&#13;
of network piping. In addition, substantial reconstruction of the city gate station of Hum was&#13;
carried out as well as some work on the cathodic protection system for the steel lines in the city&#13;
distribution network. Some heating and cooking devices were also supplied. Metering was not&#13;
provided by the humanitarian aid organizations.&#13;
37.   From January 1996-September 1997, significant additional reconstruction took place. The&#13;
reconstruction activities and their costs are listed under cofinancing in Annex 1. In general, this&#13;
aid consisted of the supply of materials -- European and Middle Eastern donors, plus US$5&#13;
million in IDA funds from the PSA. In addition, the various municipalities in the Sarajevo area&#13;
financed some of the reconstruction, mostly through the supply of materials. Over 200 km of&#13;
trenches for new network piping were dug by volunteer citizen labor. Some of the tools were&#13;
supplied by Sarajevogas. The total dollar value of the investments cofinanced this way, including&#13;
the value of citizen self-help, is estimated at US$11.9 million. Contributions by the EU, The&#13;
Netherlands, the UK and others brings the total amount of cofinancing to US$22.1 million.&#13;
38.   Project Description. The proposed project consists of the following major components:&#13;
(i) engineering analysis of entire gas transmission and distribution systems; (ii) physical&#13;
reconstruction of the gas system (except the Semizovac-Zenica branch of the transmission&#13;
pipeline, which belongs to the Zenica Steel Works (para 42); (iii) technical assistance to&#13;
Sarajevogas to implement the project and enhance its institutional capacity in management,&#13;
technical and commercial aspects and finance; and (iv) a district heating component covering&#13;
goods and works to refund the Project Start-up Advance (para. 65). Details of the project are&#13;
described below.&#13;
1.    Engineering Component&#13;
39.   Project Engineering.  An engineering contract would be given to an international&#13;
consulting engineering firm to assist in the analysis, design and contracting for the reconstruction&#13;
of both the transmission and the distribution system. Among the tasks would be to determine the&#13;
extent of pipeline corrosion. Most of the engineering work would probably be done by Bosnian&#13;
firns.  This would produce economies in project implementation.  Technical assistance to&#13;
Sarajevogas would be provided to support the entity in project implementation and strengthen the&#13;
operational capability of the entity.&#13;
a)    Transmission System&#13;
40.   An engineering analysis would be performed to identify the risks associated with the&#13;
current status of the transmission pipeline and to evaluate existing problems. This analysis would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
include the use of visual inspection and high technology sensing devices to identify and evaluate&#13;
pipeline defects. A coating analysis, along with a survey of coating integrity, would be performed&#13;
to determine areas where the coating needs to be repaired. A hydrostatic test would be&#13;
conducted, if required, to ensure the strength of the pipeline and to reestablish the maximum&#13;
allowable working pressure. This analysis would prioritize the required pipeline work.&#13;
Mechanical maintenance requirements would be analyzed and prioritized. Terms of reference for&#13;
construction, mechanical maintenance and cathodic protection remediation contracts would be&#13;
prepared. Specifications and schedules for the procurement of materials and equipment would be&#13;
issued. Maintenance and operating procedures and manuals, along with base line records, would&#13;
be prepared. Inspection of construction would be done to ensure conformance to standard&#13;
procedures. Both the transmission lines from Zvornik to Sarajevo and from Sarajevo to Zenica&#13;
would be analyzed.&#13;
b)    Sarajevo Distribution Network&#13;
41.   An engineering analysis would be performed to determine the most efficient methodology&#13;
to remediate the problems of the unsafe network connections and installations, install regulating&#13;
and metering devices, and rehabilitate the cathodic protection system. Among the tasks would be&#13;
to determine the extent of pipeline corrosion, and the most cost effective materials (synthetic,&#13;
carbon steel or other materials) to improve life expectancy of the pipelines. In addition, an&#13;
economic evaluation of supplying gas to certain areas and a system reliability analysis would be&#13;
performed. The economic evaluation would determine for which consumers it is less costly to&#13;
supply gas and for which consumers it is less costly to supply energy from alternative sources.&#13;
Baseline information would be assembled and schematics produced. Operational manuals and&#13;
guidelines would be assembled. Technical terms of reference for all reconstruction contracts,&#13;
specifications and schedules for materials procurement would be produced. Inspection of&#13;
construction would be carried out to ensure conformance to standards and the design.&#13;
2.    Reconstruction Component&#13;
a)    Transmission System&#13;
42.   Pipeline Reconstruction. Pipeline reconstruction would be carried out based on the&#13;
terms of reference established in the engineering analysis and design. Because of financial&#13;
constraints, only the main line from Zvornik to Sarajevo can be rehabilitated under the proposed&#13;
project (para. 38). The work would include cutting out sections of badly damaged pipeline,&#13;
repairing coating, remediating river and road crossings, stabilizing land slippages, repairing access&#13;
roads, removing brush from the right of way, putting up fencing and establishing signs where&#13;
necessary. The engineering fim would also conduct a hydrostatic test of the structural integrity of&#13;
the pipeline, if required. The firm would comply with recognized quality control and assurance&#13;
procedures. The actual value of this contract would be heavily dependent on the number of&#13;
pipeline cutouts required and the actual condition of the pipeline and right of way, as revealed by&#13;
the engineering analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
43.   Valve Maintenance. The project would include rehabilitation, repair and replacement, if&#13;
necessary, of the mainline block valves, take-off valves, scrapper trap installations and other&#13;
above-ground mechanical facilities, as determined by the engineering analysis.&#13;
44.   Measurement, Regulating and Metering Stations. In accordance with the requirements&#13;
set out in the engineering analysis the Butila and Hum metering and regulating stations (city gate&#13;
stations) would be rehabilitated. The Hum station has had most of the required work completed&#13;
with the help of humanitarian aid organizations. Work on this station would include minor&#13;
structures, some instrumentation and clean up. The Butila station needs to be inspected and&#13;
significant work on the metering and regulating equipment may be required. This station contains&#13;
mechanical shops and warehouse facilities that would have to be remediated. The impact of&#13;
sniper fire on the high pressure pipes would have to be investigated to determine whether the pipe&#13;
strength has been affected. A new metering facility at Kladanj would be constructed to accurately&#13;
measure gas consumption in RS. Included with this facility would be a gas chromatograph to&#13;
monitor gas quality.&#13;
45.   Cathodic Protection.  The replacement and repair of damaged cathodic protection&#13;
facilities along the pipeline may include rectifiers, repair to pipe connections, test taps and the&#13;
installation of sacrificial anodes. The exact scope would be determined through a study of the&#13;
facilities by the engineering consultant. The remediation of the cathodic protection system would&#13;
ensure that external corrosion on the pipeline is minimized.&#13;
46.   Spare Parts and Safety Equipment. As a result of the engineering analysis, a list of&#13;
spare parts required to operate the pipeline in a safe and reliable manner would be drawn up. This&#13;
would include spares for the valves, metering and regulating stations, pipeline sections, tape coat&#13;
and spares for the cathodic protection system. Safety equipment to deal with possible escapes of&#13;
gas would also be provided.&#13;
b)    Sarajevo Distribution System&#13;
47.   Measurement Reinstallation for Large Consumers.  This sub-component would&#13;
include the repair or replacement and the changing of parts in the measurement and regulation&#13;
stations of large consumers on the 8 bar, 3 bar and 0.1 bar systems.&#13;
48.   Distribution Piping Reconstruction. Includes the construction of 220 km  of&#13;
polyethylene piping to properly connect or reconnect 42,000 consumers to the system, repair&#13;
danaged network piping, complete loops and provide a safe, efficient and reliable network piping&#13;
system. The sub-component would also include installing takeoffs for connections to consumers.&#13;
49.   Measurement and Regulation Installation. Meters and regulators need to be installed&#13;
with all new connections, while all pre-war connections need to be checked and repaired. It would&#13;
include the installation of facilities from the network to the outside of the regulation and metering&#13;
boxes and the removal of the 34,000 connections to be replaced by district heating and 3,000&#13;
other illegal connections. It would also include the installation of 42,000 new meter and regulator&#13;
sets, and the correction of 11,000 existing meters and regulators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
50.   Spare Parts and Service Vehicles. This would be for the procurement of spare parts and&#13;
service vehicles that would be required to efficiently maintain the system, and would also include&#13;
safety equipment.&#13;
51.   House Installations and Appliances. Includes the partial remediation and repair of&#13;
interior piping and replacement of unsafe and inefficient heating and cooking appliances. Inside&#13;
connections would be inspected for safety of installation and materials and brought up to standard&#13;
where necessary. A simple two burner cooking device with standard safety devices and one&#13;
efficient and safe heating appliance would be supplied per residence, where required on income&#13;
grounds.&#13;
3.    Services&#13;
52.   Strategic Planning and Technical Assistance. A major technical assistance program&#13;
would be required, in order to improve institutional capabilities of Sarajevogas for the longer&#13;
term. Critical areas in which such technical assistance would be needed are: (i) project&#13;
management and engineering; (ii) financial and commercial management; and (iii) system planning.&#13;
Financial audits of the project accounts and the financial statements of Sarajevogas would be&#13;
included. Each of these tasks would include a significant on-the-job training component for&#13;
qualified staff&#13;
53.   Technical Assistance for Sector Restructuring and a Tariff Study. In order to&#13;
prepare the gas sector for desirable restructuring in the medium term, technical assistance would&#13;
be covered under the project for preparation of a gas sector restructuring plan and a tariff study.&#13;
The Borrower has agreed to carry out and complete by October 31, 1998 a sector&#13;
restructuring study for the gas sector, and a gas tariff study, and take appropriate&#13;
measures to implement agreed actions thereafter.&#13;
54.   Landmine Clearing. Selected portions of the right of way for the transmission system&#13;
and certain areas of the distribution system need to be checked for mines and should be demined,&#13;
if required.&#13;
C.    PROJECT COST&#13;
55.   The estimated total project cost, including physical contingencies of 10% of uncommitted&#13;
expenditures, is US$44 million. The foreign exchange cost is US$24 million (or 54% of the total)&#13;
and the local cost is US$20 million equivalent. The cost estimates reflect end-1997 prices and are&#13;
based on the latest international tendering information available for similar works. They exclude&#13;
customs duties and taxes, which are waived for this emergency project. The cost estimates for the&#13;
proposed project are summarized in Table 1.&#13;

US$10 million equivalent. The balance of US$33.5 million is expected to be financed by other&#13;
donors, of which US$22. lmillion has already been committed. The most important contribution&#13;
has been voluntary labor of Sarajevo residents woth about US$9.1 million towards the&#13;
construction of distribution network. The EU is financing the equipment cost for distribution&#13;
networks in several areas of Sarajevo. The UK is financing part of the cost of inspection of the&#13;
transmission pipeline. Many other donations (the largest being from The Netherlands) have&#13;
contributed to various project components. In the unlikely event that the remaining $11.4 million&#13;
financing gap cannot be completely closed during the project implementation period, the project&#13;
scope would be adjusted correspondingly by reducing investments in transmission, distribution,&#13;
engineering or studies and deferring these investments until the financing can be found.&#13;
E.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
57.   The project is rated Category B, in accordance with the Bank's Operational Manual&#13;
Statement 4.01 of October 1992. The chief requirement under a "B" project would be for&#13;
Sarajevogas to prepare and implement an environmental monitoring and mitigation plan&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
58.   Areas that require analysis, monitoring and mitigation are the construction-related&#13;
activities. All construction plans will be required to indicate what measures will be taken to&#13;
mitigate actions that are potentially harmful to the environment. A possible adverse consequence&#13;
is escape of gas. Environmental protection plans and inspections to ensure conformance will be&#13;
put in place and monitored by the engineering consultant. These would include a leak reporting&#13;
mechanism and a community awareness program to prevent disaster. The Project does not&#13;
require population resettlement, since the existing transmission pipeline only needs repairs within&#13;
the existing right-of-way and distribution network extension does not require the destruction of&#13;
housing or other property.&#13;
59.   The project would result in a net reduction in air pollution. The Sarajevo gas system was&#13;
installed to reduce the high levels of sulfur dioxide produced by burning the low grade coal&#13;
available in the area. Before it was installed, the City of Sarajevo experienced very high levels of&#13;
atmospheric pollution from the burning of wood, coal and fuel oil. The average winter&#13;
concentration of sulfur dioxide in the air in the city center was ten times greater than what was&#13;
considered acceptable by the World Health Organization. Converting self-made gas connections&#13;
to industry standard would significantly reduce gas leakage. In addition, the demand-side&#13;
management measures that would be put in place under the proposed project would increase the&#13;
efficiency of the gas use. Installation of simple, modem appliances would greatly reduce the&#13;
amount of gas used in comparison to the self-made appliances that are currently used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.   THE BORROWER AND BENEFICIARY&#13;
60.   The Credit would given to Bosnia and Herzegovina and onlent through the Federation&#13;
Government to Sarajevogas. The Borrower has agreed to onlend the funds on standard IDA&#13;
terms to Sarajevogas with a 35 year maturity.&#13;
61.   The principal Beneficiary of the Credit, Sarajevogas, was founded on May 8, 1975 by the&#13;
City of Sarajevo. The company has been responsible for the operation of the gas system within&#13;
the city, and until recently for the transmission lines from Zvornik to Sarajevo and from Sarajevo&#13;
to Zenica (para. 62). Although Sarajevogas was greatly affected by the war, the present staff of&#13;
200 has good knowledge of the system, is technically well qualified and is able to implement the&#13;
project. Sarajevogas' management is generally satisfactory, but the number of qualified managers&#13;
needs to be increased and training in current utility management methods needs to be undertaken.&#13;
Computers, telecommunications facilities and other automated management equipment are not yet&#13;
available in the required quantities, although significant progress has already been made under the&#13;
project to date.&#13;
62.   Since it was felt that Sarajevogas represented too much the interests of the Canton of&#13;
Sarajevo, as well as to ensure that all major gas users participate indirectly in future gas supply&#13;
and gas transmission negotiations, a new company called BH Gas was created on August 15,&#13;
1997. BH Gas is a limited liability company with five owners having paid initial capital&#13;
contributions of DEM 10,000 each: Sarajevogas, Energoinvest, Zenica Steel Works, the cement&#13;
factory in Kakanj and the brick factory in Visoko. The principal functions of BH Gas are to: (i)&#13;
negotiate future gas supply and transport contracts with foreign or non-Federation companies&#13;
(Gazexport, MOL, Nis-Gas, Sarajevogas - Lukawica); (ii) manage and operate (but not own) all&#13;
fixed assets related to gas transport, such as the pipeline, measurement, regulating and metering&#13;
stations; (iii) allocate gas to all major consumers; and (iv) plan and develop the future gas&#13;
transmission system in the Federation. The principal source of income of BH gas would be a fee&#13;
for the transport of gas over the pipeline sections Kladanj - Sarajevo - Zenica.&#13;
B.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
63.   In order to execute the reconstruction process efficiently and complete it on time, a&#13;
project implementation unit (PIU) has been established by Sarajevogas. The PIU is headed by a&#13;
senior Sarajevogas manager and consists of suitably qualified Sarajevogas staff, to be assisted by&#13;
experienced professionals from local and foreign engineering companies as required. The PIU&#13;
would perform system analysis, detailed project design, work scheduling, procurement,&#13;
contracting, coordination and supervision of the reconstruction process, monitoring, approval of&#13;
reconstructed components and all financial and administrative operations associated with the&#13;
implementation of the project. Procurement and financial operations associated with project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
implementation would be supported by a procurement expert with extensive experience in Bank-&#13;
financed projects. On-the-job training of Sarajevogas staff in modem utility management&#13;
techniques and methodologies would prepare the entity for the future task of efficiently operating&#13;
the reconstructed gas system. Sarajevogas agreed to maintain a Project Implementation Unit&#13;
with management and staffing acceptable to IDA.&#13;
64.   A Reconstruction Office has been set up by the City of Sarajevo to coordinate the&#13;
reconstruction efforts in various sectors. The PIU would liaise with this office on a frequent basis&#13;
to coordinate the reconstruction of the gas, heating, water, transport and electric utility systems.&#13;
The Borrower would ensure that any licenses, permits and approvals required for rapid&#13;
reconstruction will be granted promptly.&#13;
65.   A US$6.0 million Project Start-up Advance (PSA) for this project as well as a PSA for the&#13;
proposed Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project (US$5.3 million) and for the&#13;
proposed Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project (US$3.8 million) were approved by&#13;
the Board of Executive Directors on March 27, 1996. The PSA was to be used for project&#13;
preparation and start-up activities. PSAs for this and the other two projects were necessary&#13;
because no other funds were available to launch reconstruction operations. The PSAs are&#13;
advanced against the Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project's US$20 million Credit&#13;
from the TFBH. To ensure that the full US$20 million will be available for district heating, the&#13;
Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project and the proposed Emergency Natural Gas&#13;
System Reconstruction Project contain and would contain, respectively, components for the&#13;
Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project. After Board approval and effectiveness,&#13;
these components will be financed from the respective Credits for these projects.&#13;
66.   Implementation Schedule. The three main project implementation phases, to be&#13;
scheduled as tightly as possible, are: (i) project preparation; (ii) engineering analysis, design and&#13;
contracting; and (iii) reconstruction. A detailed Project Implementation Schedule is shown in&#13;
Annex 2. The schedule requires rapid mobilization of major financial and manpower resources.&#13;
Project preparation activities such as reconstruction of office facilities for the PIU have already&#13;
been completed under Bank-administered Dutch Trust Fund financing. The project is expected to&#13;
be completed by January 31, 1999. Project monitoring indicators are also in Annex 2.&#13;
C.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
67.   IDA's procurement rules for Bosnia Emergency Project would be applicable only to IDA-&#13;
financed packages and to those packages for which donors have agreed to follow the IDA&#13;
procurement rules. Procurement for all other packages will follow the rules defined by the&#13;
individual donors. The scope of procurement is based on preliminary inspection of the gas system&#13;
and is subject to change as more complete detailed design information becomes available in the&#13;
course of project implementation. The procurement procedures outlined below would apply to all&#13;
IDA-financed or IDA-managed procurement packages. The Bank's procurement rules were&#13;
introduced to Sarajevogas during project preparation in spring 1996, and a procurement and&#13;
disbursement seminar will be held at the Beneficiary upon Credit effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
68.   For procurement packages estimated to cost more than US$2 million each, International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be used for goods and works. A General Procurement Notice&#13;
(GPN) was published in Development Business in April 1996, and a second notice was published&#13;
in May 1997. This notice includes information about the nature of goods and works to be&#13;
procured and invites interested and eligible suppliers to send their expression of interest to the&#13;
PIU. The GPN was also published in the local press and will be followed by specific&#13;
advertisements for individual contracts in the local press. Because of the emergency nature of the&#13;
project the period allowed for submission of bids may be reduced to four weeks. Bid and&#13;
payment currency may also be limited to one currency widely used in international trade.&#13;
69.   Limited International Bidding (LID), tendering by invitation, would be used for goods,&#13;
estimated to cost up to US$2 million per procurement package, and would be used only when&#13;
there are few potential suppliers. The list of LIB bidders would be based on the expression of&#13;
interest received in response to the GPN as well as other sources, such as Sarajevogas's&#13;
experience, etc. The list should broad enough to encourage effective competition.&#13;
70.   International Shopping (IS) would be used for procuring equipment and materials or&#13;
standard specification commodities, estimated to cost up to US$500,000 per contract, with the&#13;
aggregate amount not exceeding US$3.0 million. IS procedures are based on comparison of price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three suppliers in two countries.&#13;
71.   National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures will be used for works up to US$2&#13;
million per package, not exceeding a cumulative total of about US$7.0 million.&#13;
72    National Shopping (NS) will be used for goods available within BH, such as office&#13;
firniture, equipment and supplies, up to an estimated costs of $100,000 per contract with at least&#13;
three quotations from national suppliers.&#13;
73.   Direct Contracting (DC) will be used for items of a proprietary nature or where direct&#13;
compatibility with installed equipment is required, i.e. for spare parts. Direct contracting would&#13;
have to be justified in each case.&#13;
74.   Consultant services would be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines, using sole&#13;
sources contracting, QCBS and QBS. Sole source contracting would have to be justified in&#13;
each case. Such justification would include the time constraint, continuity, unique expertise, and&#13;
the lack of candidates given the situation in BH. Any sole sourcing during implementation would&#13;
be subject to IDA's approval. Follow-up assignments would be permissible to the extent that this&#13;
is indicated in the initial Terms of Reference for assignments. Disbursements for the PIU's&#13;
incremental operating costs, such as office rent, utilities, and incremental local staff costs, would&#13;
be made upon approval by IDA.&#13;
75.   The landmine component of the project would be carried out by the Emergency&#13;
Landmines Clearance Project (Credit No. 2905-BOS). Therefore, the procurement procedures&#13;
would be those used under the landmines project (National Competitive Bidding). The tasks&#13;
involved would be to (i) determine whether there are landmines in the areas where project works&#13;
are to be carried out; and (ii) remove the mines. The landmines project would be reimbursed for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
these tasks from the IDA credit for the gas project. Procurement for the district heating&#13;
component of the project (para. 65) would be carried out using the procedures set forth for the&#13;
Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project (Trust Fund No. 024034).&#13;
76.   Prior and ex post review by IDA of procurement documents. The Bank's standard&#13;
bidding documents would be used for ICB and LIB procurement packages. All ICB, LIB, NCB&#13;
and IS bidding documents, all consultants' contracts and NS contracts in excess of US$50,000&#13;
would require prior review by IDA. Prior Bank approval is required for any Direct Contracting.&#13;
A quarterly plan of incremental operating costs will need the Bank's prior review. Quarterly&#13;
accounting of actual expenditures of the subsequent quarter will be presented to the Bank for its&#13;
review. Contracts would be subject to an ex-post review at IDA's discretion. For consultants'&#13;
contracts, the Bank's standard form would be used. Procurement actions would be carried out in&#13;
close coordination with the Procurement Monitoring and Auditing Unit.&#13;
D.    DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
77.   The estimated disbursements schedule is summarized in Schedule B of the Memorandum&#13;
of the President. Disbursements are expected to be completed within one year from the date of&#13;
effectiveness.  To facilitate timely project implementation, the Beneficiary would establish,&#13;
maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to IDA, two Special Accounts in US dollars in&#13;
commercial banks acceptable to IDA the first being for disbursements other than in the district&#13;
heating component, the second being for the district heating component.  The authorized&#13;
allocation of the Special Account for the gas components would be limited to US$1.5 million,&#13;
representing about four months (average) of IDA's share of estimated expenditures expected to&#13;
be paid from the Special Account. The authorized allocation of the Special Account for the&#13;
district heating components would be limited to US$1.8 million. Replenishment applications&#13;
would be forwarded to IDA on a monthly basis, and must include reconciled bank statements as&#13;
well as other appropriate documents. For large contracts, IDA would make direct payments to&#13;
suppliers or contractors.&#13;
78.   The IDA Credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of the expenditures for directly&#13;
imported equipment, materials and services quoted on CIF basis; (b) 100% of local expenditures&#13;
of goods (ex-factory cost) and 85% of local expenditures for other goods procured locally; (c)&#13;
100% of civil works (net of taxes); (d) 100% of expenditures for consultants' services (Table 2);&#13;
and (e) 100% for incremental operating costs. Disbursements would be made against Statements&#13;
of Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts for goods and works up to US$50,000, including&#13;
incremental operating costs and training. For these, detailed documents evidencing expenditures&#13;
would be reviewed by the PIU and made available for the required audit as well as IDA&#13;
supervision missions. Disbursements for contracts requiring the IDA's prior review would be&#13;
made against presentation to IDA of full contract documentation. Disbursements for incremental&#13;
operating costs would be made against expenditures under the plan approved by IDA. The&#13;
project completion date would be January 31, 1999 and the closing date would be July 30, 1999.&#13;

E.    AccouNTs, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
79.   Separate and auditable project accounts would be established by the PIU. These accounts&#13;
would include: (i) a record of withdrawals on the IDA Credit with copies of all disbursement&#13;
requests and underlying documentation; and (ii) a record of transactions on the Special Accounts&#13;
and the copies of the bank statements on this account. Technical assistance has been included&#13;
under the project to establish proper accounts and financial controlling procedures.&#13;
80.   The financial statements of Sarajevogas and the project accounts would be audited&#13;
annually by independent auditors and under terms of reference acceptable to IDA. If Sarajevogas&#13;
so desires, the audits could be financed from the IDA Credit. Separate audit statements would be&#13;
prepared for the Special Accounts and for SOEs. All audit reports would be made available to&#13;
IDA at the latest six months after the end of the fiscal year. Project accounts would be&#13;
maintained for one year after they have been audited. Sarajevogas would separately prepare and&#13;
furnish to IDA quarterly progress reports showing the status of implementation of the project,&#13;
with special reference to the monitoring indicators (Annex 2), progress in billings and collections,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
'21&#13;
purchases of gas, and semi-annual icome statements. Sarajevogas agreed to submit project&#13;
accounts and financial statements audited by an auditor acceptable to IDA.&#13;
F.    SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
81.   Project implementation would require intensive IDA staff involvement, especially during&#13;
the first 4-5 months of implementation and would require a high degree of flexibility to adapt to&#13;
rapidly changing circumstances.  Implementation progress would be formally evaluated&#13;
approximately 5 months after effectiveness, when project implementation should be in full swing.&#13;
In addition, the Bank's Resident Mission in Sarajevo would assist in supervising initial project&#13;
implementation and would assist closely on matters requiring advice and rapid decisions by IDA,&#13;
such as procurement and disbursements.&#13;
VI. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS&#13;
A.   PAST AND CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION&#13;
82.   Sarajevogas' financial statements, including forecasts up to the year 2000, are presented in&#13;
Annex 4. Before the war, -Sarajevogas was allowed to set tariffs which covered its operating&#13;
expenses plus a modest profit margin, and funding for major investments was provided (until&#13;
1990) by the Central Government. Sarajevogas' operations were severely affected by war&#13;
damages and the proliferation of unauthorized connections foliowing the shutdown of large parts&#13;
of the district heating system. By order of the City Government, consumers did not have to pay&#13;
for gas consumption during the war. Sarajevogas continued to operate its facilities during the&#13;
war, but incurred substantial losses, which were financed mainly through non-payment of&#13;
creditors, notably Gazexport for the period through October 9, 1995 (para 13). Payments&#13;
through 1996 were financed by Sarajevogas, the Sarajevo Canton and Federation Governments,&#13;
and grants from the Dutch and Turkish Governments. Gas payments in the first quarter of 1997&#13;
were made entirely by Sarajevogas.&#13;
83.   Cost Structure. At normal operating levels, gas purchases account for about 70% of&#13;
Sarajevogas' total operating expenses, and an even larger share (90%) of its cash operating&#13;
expenses. Sarajevogas' operating and maintenance costs are at acceptable levels; however, these&#13;
levels are partly due to depressed wages and salaries. As wage and salary levels increase,&#13;
management will need to give attention to measures to increase productivity. Depreciation&#13;
charges (only about 0.5% of gross fixed assets in some years) will need to be raised to appropriate&#13;
levels and be reflected in Sarajevogas' tariffs so that the company can generate sufficient cash flow&#13;
to finance normal levels of investments and operations. In addition, Sarajevogas will need to&#13;
revalue its assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
84.   Tariffs. The current tariff structure is differentiated by classes of consumers: households,&#13;
schools, kindergartens and Toplane-Sarajevo (the district heating company) pay about US$0.17&#13;
per m3; hospitals, clinics, social and cultural facilities pay about US$0.22 per m3; and commercial&#13;
establishments and industrial enterprises pay about US$0.26 per m3. These tariffs cover, in&#13;
principle, operating expenses including normal repair and maintenance and a small (1-2%) profit&#13;
margin, but do not allow for substantial financing of investments. While there are no lifeline&#13;
tariffs in effect at present, the Canton of Sarajevo provides ad hoc support to low-income&#13;
consumers for their gas use. A proposal to increase tariff levels by about 25% for the first&#13;
category and by 12% for the second is under consideration by the Sarajevo Canton Government.&#13;
85.   Metering, Billing and Collection. Prior to the war, Sarajevogas' main consumers were:&#13;
(i) Toplane - Sarajevo, which accounted for about 50% of the gas purchased; (ii) about 1,600&#13;
smaller users, including restaurants, shops, and other commercial establishments; (iii) about 400&#13;
larger, including industrial, users; and (iv) about 15,000 households that were not connected to&#13;
the district heating system. Most of these users were metered. During the war, parts of&#13;
Sarajevogas' office facilities, including its billing and collection system, were destroyed and billing&#13;
and collection was suspended for household consumers. The billing system has mostly been&#13;
restored, upgraded and reintroduced with the aid of UN funding; the first complete billing cycles&#13;
took place during January-March of 1997, but were interrupted when the gas supply to BH was&#13;
first gradually diminished and then cut off (para. 14). Nevertheless some 70% of all bills have&#13;
been collected since then. It is expected that bill collection will reach higher levels now that the&#13;
gas supply has been restored and once consumers regain confidence in the continuity of supply.&#13;
86.   Payables. Payables by Sarajevogas do not include an estimated US$105 million owed to&#13;
Gazexport for the period 1992 to October 1995; Sarajevogas is not carrying this amount on its&#13;
books pending resolution of this issue (para. 13). In addition, there are debts incurred prior to the&#13;
war, which Sarajevogas was not able to service during the war. This includes, principally, an&#13;
amount of US$40 million including overdue principal and interest under IBRD Loan No. 1264-&#13;
YU which was consolidated in June 1996 for repayment under the Bank's Consolidation Loan&#13;
(Loan No. 4039) to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Consequently, Sarajevogas has become a debtor to&#13;
the Government and will need to bear the debt service on its share of the Consolidation Loan.&#13;
For the period 1997 to 2000, this would involve annual interest payments of around US$2.65&#13;
million per year, but no repayment of principal, given the grace period of five years.&#13;
B.    FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
87.   Annual gas consumption was about 213 million m3 in 1996; it is expected to be only 120&#13;
million m3 in 1997, since gas supplies have been interrrupted since April 1, 1997. Taking into&#13;
account the expected improvements in gas consumption efficiency under the project on the one&#13;
hand, and increases in industrial/commercial demand on the other hand, annual gas consumption is&#13;
projected to be 190 million m3 in 1998, 200 million in m3 in 1999 and 203 million m3 in 2000.&#13;
Given the continuing difficulties faced by households in the post-war period, cost recovery (in&#13;
terms of the percentage of total annual cash operating expenses covered) can realistically be&#13;
expected to be no more than 60, 100 and 140 % in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively. Shortfalls,&#13;
if any, would be made up by the Canton of Sarajevo. Sarajevogas agreed to institute billing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
and collection systems resulting in collection of at least 60%, 100% and 140% of total&#13;
annual cash operating expenses for 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively. Details of the&#13;
financing plan for 1996 to 1999 are in Annex 4. The summary plan is shown in Table 3 below.&#13;

88.   Due to the interrupted- gas supplies and the still low (although improving) revenue&#13;
collection rates in 1997, Sarajevogas is expected to incur a cash deficit in 1997 which will be&#13;
covered primarily by the Canton of Sarajevo. However, starting in 1998, as a result of the higher&#13;
tariff rates (para. 84) and the expected improvement in collection rates, Sarajevogas should be&#13;
able to generate adequate internal cash flows and to reach full cost recovery levels by 1999,&#13;
including depreciation. This would enable Sarajevogas to make the necessary investments to&#13;
progressively replace and renovate its largely depreciated assets after completion of the&#13;
emergency project, and to make the annual repayment of its share of the maturities of the Bank's&#13;
Consolidated Loan as they fall due starting with the year 2001.&#13;
C.    ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
89.   Comparison of Heating Options. During the war, coal and oil (and generally wood)&#13;
were not available for space heating. Electricity supplies were sharply reduced and were only&#13;
sporadically available for short periods of time. Hence space heating with electricity - widespread&#13;
before the war - also was no longer an option. The gas-fired district heating system was partly&#13;
damaged early in the war and could supply only one-third of its normal service area. The&#13;
availability of natural gas, although at low pressure and in restricted quantities, led about 74,000&#13;
households and some commercial entities to make their own improvised connections to the gas&#13;
network. These installations are very unsafe: since their introduction there have been 220&#13;
explosions related to gas use, resulting in 32 fatalities and more than 200 injuries. In addition, the&#13;
installations last for only one to two years and use up to twice as much gas to produce the same&#13;
useful heat as would be needed for proper installations. This improvised heat supply option was&#13;
adopted under the severest of emergency conditions and obviously should be replaced as soon as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
possible. Some 34,000 customers have already been switched back to district heating. Under the&#13;
proposed project, 38,000 irregular household connections would be converted to regular gas&#13;
connections and the 15,000 pre-war household gas connections would be rehabilitated (the&#13;
meter/regulator sets on these connections need to be repaired or replaced). All 53,000 gas&#13;
consumers would be fully regularized by the end of 1998. The altemative option of supplying&#13;
these customers with district heat would be very costly because of the distance from existing heat&#13;
networks; these networks serve apartment buildings whereas the direct gas household consumers&#13;
live in detached dwellings. Comparisons with other alternative space heating and cooking options&#13;
confirmed that gas is less costly than electricity (using either ordinary space heaters or storage&#13;
heaters that operate only during off-peak hours) or a combination of fuel oil for space heating and&#13;
liquified petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking (Annex 5).&#13;
90.   Economic Rate of Return Calculation.   An economic rate of return is normally not&#13;
calculated for emergency reconstruction projects since the need for those investments is usually&#13;
evident and the data needed for the calculation are often deficient. However, an estimate was&#13;
made for the proposed project since some useful data on benefits have become available as a&#13;
result of investments already made for the project, especially on meters and a computerized billing&#13;
system.&#13;
91.   In the absence of the project most consumers are assumed to use their existing (or&#13;
improved) irregular connections. This has occurred up to now, and new inhabitants of houses&#13;
abandoned at the end of the war have made new irregular connections. The benefits of the project&#13;
include: (i) avoided costs of new or replaced irregular connections; (ii) avoided gas transmission&#13;
and distribution losses; (iii) avoided costs from gas explosions; (iv) avoided uneconomic&#13;
consumption of gas due to the absence of meters and regulators; and (v) the avoided cost of&#13;
substitute energy that would be needed if the irregular connection system had to be shut down for&#13;
safety reasons because of the danger posed by ever greater gas leaks over time.&#13;
92.   The above benefits were estimated as follows:&#13;
(i) The avoided connection cost benefit assumes that, in the absence of the project, 38,000&#13;
improvised connections would be replaced every two years at a cost per connection of&#13;
DM150 (DM 30 for a steel saddle, DM 20 for steel pipe and DM 100 for indoor&#13;
installation).&#13;
(ii) The avoided transmission and distribution loss estimate assumes that, in the absence of&#13;
the project, losses, mostly in the irregular distribution network, would rise from about 4%&#13;
of gas consumption by households in 1997 to 10% in 2000, after which distribution to&#13;
households would be shut off because of the danger of explosions.3 The lost gas is valued&#13;
at the delivered import gas cost of $118/thousand ni3 plus operating cost of $3/thousand&#13;
m3.&#13;
3 Individual consumers would not repair the improvised leaking network on their own unless they know that it is&#13;
the sections they had built which are leaking.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
(iii) The avoided accident cost estimate assumes, in the absence of the project, 28&#13;
explosions per year (equal to the rate since an odorant was added to the gas) and a cost of&#13;
DM125,000 to replace a destroyed house and contents. No account is taken of the costs&#13;
attributable to deaths or injuries. While most recent explosions have been in empty&#13;
dwellings, they can occur in dwellings where elderly persons live who cannot smell leaking&#13;
gas or where children too young to deal with a gas leak are left alone.&#13;
(iv) The avoided uneconomic gas consumption was estimated on the basis of data for the&#13;
months of December 1996 to March 1997, during which Sarajevogas's new computerized&#13;
billing system was in effect. Average consumption by unmetered households (mostly&#13;
irregular) during this period was 43% higher than consumption by metered (regularized)&#13;
households. The extra consumption was due to the absence of regulators (which reduce&#13;
gas pressure from 100 millibars to 25-35 millibars) and billing based on unmetered&#13;
consumption (as a result, the unmetered consumer has no incentive to limit consumption).&#13;
The value of this extra consumption to an individual consumer would be very small. It&#13;
was assumed to be one-quarter of the retail household gas price of DM 37/m3 for each&#13;
extra m3 consumed. The cost of the extra consumption was valued at the import price of&#13;
US$118/thousand m3 plus US$3/thousand m3 for operating costs. The net extra cost is&#13;
US$9.34/m3 of extra consumption.&#13;
(v) The avoided cost of a fuel substitute was estimated as the difference between the cost&#13;
of heating and cooking by gas (assuming regularized connections) and the cost of heating&#13;
with fuel oil and cooking with liquified petroleum gas (Annex 5). The oil alternative was&#13;
selected rather than the more widely used electricity option, since its cost was estimated to&#13;
be lower.&#13;
93.   For purposes of the rate of return calculation, the costs were taken as the total project&#13;
cost ($43.5 million) less the transmission investment in RS (US$1.5 million) and the cost of&#13;
studies of sector restructuring and alternative gas supply sources (US$1.85 million). The RS&#13;
transmission component was excluded since it is already taken into account in the fee for gas&#13;
transit through RS. The studies were excluded because of the difficulty of quantifying their&#13;
benefits, even though they could be large.&#13;
94.   The cost and benefit estimates exclude taxes. The existing exchange rate of US$1.00 =&#13;
DM1.75 was considered to be equal to the shadow rate of foreign exchange because of the use of&#13;
the DM as the main domestic currency in the Federation. Actual wage rates were assumed in the&#13;
absence of a reliable estimate of a shadow wage rate. However, a sensitivity calculation is shown&#13;
below in which the voluntary labor of gas consumers in helping construct regularized connections&#13;
is valued at zero rather than US$9.1 million.&#13;
95.   The internal economic rate of return was estimated to be 30%, which is more than&#13;
satisfactory (the calculation is in Annex 6). Sensitivity tests were carried out with respect to&#13;
changes in key parameters in order to determine the switching values. The changes needed to&#13;
reduce the rate of return to the assumed opportunity cost of capital of 12% would be: (i) a 300%&#13;
increase in the 1998 investment cost; or (ii) a 110% increase in the delivered natural gas import&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
price; or (iii) a 40% reduction in heating oil and LPG prices; or (iv) a 60% reduction in household&#13;
gas consumption. Postponing the assumed date of shutdown of the improvised gas system would&#13;
reduce the rate of return, but even a postponement beyond the year 2011 would not bring the rate&#13;
down to 12%. If voluntary labor in constructing regular distribution network and installing&#13;
improvised gas connections is valued at zero, the rate of return would rise to 42%.&#13;
96.   Sensitivity tests were also carried out to evaluate whether the risk of future interruption in&#13;
gas supplies would offset the advantage of natural gas over electricity. While the conclusion of&#13;
satisfactory contracts for the import of natural gas should assure a continuous supply to Sarajevo&#13;
from now on, another interruption due to political events in RS cannot be entirely ruled out.&#13;
Many households have already taken precautions against further interruptions by buying electric&#13;
heaters and/or maintaining the possibility of using wood as fuel. In these circumstances, it is&#13;
justifiable to add the cost of the appliances for using substitute energy to the cost of the natural&#13;
gas option. From Annex 5, it can be seen that by including in the gas option the cost of four&#13;
electric storage heaters per household for all 53,000 gas-connected households (which would&#13;
provide the same amount of heat) the gas option would still have a lower present value of costs&#13;
than the option of using electricity with storage heaters. The electricity option (with storage&#13;
heaters) would, however, become less costly than the gas option if gas would not be available for&#13;
more than the next two years. The prospects of such an outcome are slim, first since households&#13;
would spend much less than assumed here on electric space heaters for back-up use, and, second,&#13;
since a two-year interruption in gas supplies is highly unlikely.&#13;
D.   RISKS&#13;
97.   There are no significant risks associated with this project, other than a renewed outbreak&#13;
of hostilities or interruption of the gas supply by RS for political reasons. Consumers' ability to&#13;
pay, while still low, has been increasing steadily. Any operating deficits would be funded by the&#13;
Sarajevo Canton budget, which is quite robust, or services would have to be cut back. However,&#13;
the financial risk of Sarajevogas having inadequate cash flow is addressed by the project's&#13;
emphasis on speedy reintroduction of billing and collection and by agreeing on specific minimum&#13;
targets for collections on an annual basis. A tariff study would be implemented and, over the&#13;
longer term, tariffs ought to reflect costs in order to ensure adequate enterprise cash flow to&#13;
maintain and expand the system. Project cost overruns are possible, despite the inclusion of a&#13;
10% physical contingency on the uncommitted portion of the project, if the damage in certain&#13;
areas turns out to be more severe than expected. Implementation delays might occur because of&#13;
unexpected technical complications and because of a possible multiplicity of procurement&#13;
procedures, depending on the number of donors and international financial institutions involved.&#13;
The latter risk is manageable, because qualified experts will assist Sarajevogas in procurement and&#13;
project implementation. The risk of the project's financing plan remaining incomplete (financing&#13;
gap) has been mitigated by the design of the project, with the higher priority investments being&#13;
carried out first. Furthermore, the remaining financing gap is quite small and expected to be&#13;
closed soon. The most serious risk, future interruptions of the gas supply, has been mitigated by&#13;
the conclusion of satisfactory long-term agreements with Gazexport and the transit companies in&#13;
Hungary, FRY and Republika Srpska, respectively.&#13;

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED&#13;
98.   Agreement was reached with the Borrower that it would:&#13;
(a) ensure that any licenses, permits and approvals required for rapid reconstruction will&#13;
be granted promptly (para. 64);&#13;
(b) on-lend the funds through the Federation on standard IDA terms to Sarajevogas for a&#13;
35 year maturity (para. 60); and&#13;
(c) complete, by October 31, 1998, a sector restructuring study for the gas sector, and a&#13;
gas tariff study, and take appropriate measures to implement agreed actions thereafter&#13;
(para. 53).&#13;
99.   Agreement was reached with Sarajevogas that it would:&#13;
(a) maintain a Project Implementation Unit with management and staffing acceptable to&#13;
IDA (para. 63);&#13;
(b) institute billing and collection systems resulting in coliection of at least 60%, 100% and&#13;
140% of total annual cash operating expenses for 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively&#13;
(para. 87); and&#13;
(c) submit project accounts and financial statements audited by an auditor acceptable to&#13;
IDA (para. 80).&#13;
100.  Conditions of effectiveness would be: (i) full and adequate staffing of the PIU in&#13;
Sarajevogas; and (ii) execution of a subsidiary credit agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
and Sarajevogas.&#13;

Assumptions:&#13;
Column 2: total project cost ($43.5 million) less transmission investments in RS($1.5 million) and studies ($1.85 million).&#13;
Column 3: household gas consumption attributable to the project of 22 million m3 in 1997,105 million m3 in 1998 and 110 million m3 in 1999 times import price&#13;
of $118/thousand m3.&#13;
Column 4: assumes $3/thousand m3 based on Sarajevogas' forecast for 1998.&#13;
Column 5: sum of columns 2, 3 and 4.&#13;
Column 6: assumes four 3.5 kW gas heaters per household, $257/heater, 22,000 households in 1997 and 53,000 thereafter.&#13;
Column 7: sum of columns 5 and 6.&#13;
Column 8: column 5 adjusted down by 10% to take account of the gas option's convenience and environmental benefits compared to the oil option.&#13;
Column 9: assumes same consumption of oil as gas for household space heating, 20 million liters in 1997, 96 million in 1998 and 101 million in 1999 and after.&#13;
The heating oil price is assumed to be US$0.27 per liter, which is below the actual price of $0.34. However, this price is comparable to costs in other countries.&#13;
Column 10: assumes an LPG price of $36/million kcals, 1.4 million kcals/ household per year for cooking, 22,000 households in 1997 and 53,000 households after.&#13;
Column 11: the sum of column 9 and column 10.&#13;
Column 12: assumes 9.7 kWh/m3 of gas and the same electricity use as for gas (22 million m3 in 1997, 105 million m3 in 1998 and 110 million m3 thereafter)  &gt;&#13;
The electricity is valued at the average long run marginal cost for low-voltage customers, estimated at $0.09/kWh                                      G &gt;&#13;
Column 13: assumes four 3.5 kW heaters per household at $114/heater, for 22,000 households in 1997 and 53,000 households thereafter.                   m z&#13;
Column 14: the sum of columns 12 and 13.                                                                                                                  m&#13;
Column 15: the same assumptions as for column 12, except the electricity for heating (90% of the total) is valued at the off-peak marginal cost&#13;
estimated at $0.03/kWh.&#13;
Column 16: assumes four electric storage heaters/household at $343/heater, for 22,000 households in 1997 and 53,000 thereafter.&#13;

IRR=         30%&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
1/ Total project cost($43.5 million) less investments in RS($1.5 million) and studies($1.85 million).&#13;
2/ Replacement of half of 38,000 irregular connections each year at a cost of $86/connection.&#13;
3/ Losses of 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively, of household&#13;
consumption of 77 million m3, 105 million m3, 110 million m3 and 110 million m3, respectively&#13;
valued at the import price of $118/thousand m3 plus O&amp;M of $3/thousand m3.&#13;
4/ Damages from 28 explosions per year repaired at a cost of $71,000! building damaged.&#13;
The 1997 total is lower since only one-third of the connections were regularized by the project.&#13;
5/ Extra consumption is assumed to be 43% of household consumption of 22 million m3 in 1997,&#13;
105 million m3 in 1998, and 110 million m3 in 1999 and 2000. The 1997 number is the estimated&#13;
consumption of metered consumers (9,000 in early 1997, 22,000 at the end of the year).&#13;
The cost of the extra consumption was valued at $121/thousand m3 (import price plus O&amp;M).&#13;
The benefit was valued at one-quarter of the extra consumption times the retail price of $0.22/m3.&#13;
The net cost is the difference between the cost and the benefit.&#13;
6/ The estimate is equal to the difference between the cost of heating with oil and the cost of&#13;
heating with gas (Column 11 minus Column 8 in Annex 5).&#13;

            Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency Natural
            Gas System Reconstruction Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Natural Gas System
            Reconstruction Project has several objectives: a) to restore
            a safe and reliable gas supply to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in
            particular to Sarajevo, as soon as possible by repairing or
            reconstructing the gas transmission and distribution
            systems; b) to enhance safety and energy efficiency and
            reduce environmental pollution by converting self-made gas
            connections to industry standards; and c) to enhance cost
            recovery, strengthen the institutional capacity of
            Sarajevogas, identify alternative sources of gas supply, and
            repair the transmission facilities within Republika Sprska.
            The project consists of the following main components: 1)
            engineering analysis of the gas transmission and
            distribution systems; 2) physical reconstruction of the gas
            system; 3) technical assistance to Sarajevogas to implement
            the project and enhance institutional capacity in
            management, technical, and commercial/financial aspects; and
            4) a district heating component covering goods and works to
            offset the Project Start-up Advance, which is to be used for
            project preparation and start-up activities.
