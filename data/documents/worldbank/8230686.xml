       WRAT IS A SAM? A LAPMAN'S  GUIDE TO SOCIAL ACCOUNTING MATRICES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                This paper is intended as an introduction for readers&#13;
      who   have   no  previous  familiarity   with   social  accounting&#13;
      matrices.    It assumes nothing more from the reader than a&#13;
      rudimentary knowledge of national income accounting.&#13;
&#13;
                Starting  ftom the simplest     formlation,    the paper&#13;
      introduces step by step many of the main features of a social&#13;
      accounting matrix i n its fully developed and more complex&#13;
      form.    An explanation is given of the relationship between&#13;
      social   accounting  matrices   on   the  one hand   and   national&#13;
      accounts, input-output matrices and multipliers on the other.&#13;

          This paper has its origin i n a conference held i n Cambridge,&#13;
&#13;
England i n 1978, which was sponsored by the World Bank External Research&#13;
&#13;
Program under research project 671-27.         The author was one of the two&#13;
&#13;
participants a t that conference who did not belong to the "subculture" of&#13;
&#13;
practitioners   and connoisseurs of      SAMs or social accounting matrices.&#13;
&#13;
Graham Pyatt, who is responsible f o r the research project and who organized&#13;
&#13;
the conference, subsequently persuaded the author t o write a guide t o SAMs&#13;
&#13;
f c r the layman.  The author's  principal qualification was that he shared&#13;
&#13;
with his    intended audience an almost        complete ignorance of  the SAM&#13;
&#13;
framework; without that ignorance he would never had. had the temerity t o&#13;
&#13;
undertake such a task.    Once it was launched, Graham Pyatt commented on&#13;
&#13;
each successive draft and edited extensively with good reason.     Many useful&#13;
&#13;
comments were also made by Clive B e l l ,  Alan Gelb, Sherman Robinson, Alan&#13;
&#13;
Roe and Jeffrey Round.   The f i n a l product, as usual, remains the author's&#13;
&#13;
reluctant responsibility.&#13;

   Introduction&#13;
&#13;
  1.        A social accounting matrix, familiarly known a s SAM t o the limited&#13;
&#13;
   fraternity familiar with it, has two principal objectives.                 The f i r s t is&#13;
&#13;
   concerned with the organization of in£ormation, usually in£ormation about&#13;
&#13;
   the economic and social structure of a country i n a particular year, though&#13;
&#13;
   it could as well be about a region in a country, a city or any other unit&#13;
&#13;
   which one is interested i n and the unit of time, though convenient, is&#13;
&#13;
   arbitrary.        Complaints   about  the   inconsistency         and unreliability      of&#13;
&#13;
   economic and social data i n developing countries have reached the point of&#13;
&#13;
   being trite.        While there is justification i n these complaints, they are&#13;
&#13;
   not the whole story.       There is of ten idormation, dispersed ,r fragmentary,&#13;
&#13;
   which is not used for lack of a framework t o make the maximum use of the&#13;
&#13;
   available information and t o pinpoint with greater accuracy and specificity&#13;
&#13;
   than is usually done the salient gaps and inconsistencies.&#13;
&#13;
   2.       Once the data i n a particular country f o r a particular year have&#13;
&#13;
   been organized i n the form of a SAM, they present a s t a t i c image which can&#13;
&#13;
   reveal much about economic structure.               Even so,       the image is only a&#13;
&#13;
   "snapshot."        I n order t o analyze Row the economy works and predict the&#13;
&#13;
   effects of policy intervenrions i n order t o change it, more is needed thnn&#13;
&#13;
    just a s t a t t c image.   A model of the economy has t o be created which can&#13;
&#13;
   simulate the effects of interventions, f a r example.                 This is the second&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I   objective of a SAM:       t o provide the s t a t i s t i c a l basis for creation of a&#13;
&#13;
    plausible model.&#13;
&#13;
    3.       The principle of a SAM is really nothing more than that of double&#13;
&#13;
    entry bookkeeping.       It is a series of accounts in each of which incomi~gs&#13;
&#13;
    and outgoing.       for income and expenditure i n many cases) must balance.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Furthermore, what is "incoming" into one accouct must be "outgoing" from&#13;
&#13;
another account.   I n t h i s respect, a SAM resembles traditional national&#13;
&#13;
accounts.   In fact, as w i l l   be demonstrated later, a SAM embodies the&#13;
&#13;
information normally included i n national accounts and nuch more.      I n a SAM&#13;
&#13;
the double entries are achieved by only a single entry .in a matrix which&#13;
&#13;
resembles an oversized chessboard.     Each account consists of one row across&#13;
&#13;
the board and one column down it, identically numbered.      We shall explain&#13;
&#13;
how this works shortly.&#13;
&#13;
4.       How large   the matrix is depends on the limitations of              the&#13;
&#13;
available data and the motivation one has for constructing it.                  In&#13;
&#13;
principle, there is no limit t o the fineness of detail.     In practice, both&#13;
&#13;
the data and the effort available f o r constructing the SAM impose limita-&#13;
&#13;
tions.   One of the original motivations for the elaboration of SAMs has&#13;
&#13;
been the growing interest i n issues of poverty and basic needs.           If one&#13;
&#13;
wishes t o show how different actfvities affect or are affected by different&#13;
&#13;
socioeconomic groups i n society, the amount of detail must correspond t o&#13;
&#13;
the differentiation one wishes t o make.&#13;
&#13;
5.   This paper does not attempt t o examine the problems arising i n the&#13;
&#13;
construction of SAMs nor the methods of economic analysis which use the&#13;
&#13;
assembled data.   In other words, it is not addressed t o specialists but t o&#13;
&#13;
 the broader audience of those who need an introduction t o SAM'S.         I n the&#13;
&#13;
 rest of the paper we shall proceed with simplified examples of SAMs, based&#13;
&#13;
 on more elaborate ones published elsewhere.      W eshall s t a r t a t the very&#13;
&#13;
 simplest level with a purely imaginary economy and proceed by increasing&#13;
&#13;
 size and complexity with examples of SAM'S worked out for real economies,&#13;
&#13;
 Sri Lanka and Botswana.       The reason for using two different vehicles,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   rather than carrying the reader non-stop on one, is that they illustrate&#13;
&#13;
   the fact   that   SAM'S   may be constructed i n different gays--or,     more&#13;
&#13;
   properly, with different accents--for different purposes.      Some points of&#13;
&#13;
   interest FAY  occur i n one and others i n a.r.=ther.&#13;
&#13;
   A Primitive Examle: the Robinson Crusoe Economy&#13;
&#13;
   6        As an expository device, the Robinson Crusoe economy has perhaps&#13;
&#13;
   become rather shopworn.      Nevertheless, for want of something better, we&#13;
&#13;
   shall use it again as a point of entry into the description of SAW+.       We&#13;
&#13;
   shall assume that Robinson engages i n only one production activity, the&#13;
&#13;
   picking of coconuts.     In some given period, he picks 1,000 coconuts.  This&#13;
&#13;
   represents a t the sane t i m e  the level of production, the level of his&#13;
&#13;
   income and    the   level of   his demand for products      (sometimes called&#13;
&#13;
   "wants").  A l l three are equal, as they must be i n such an economy.&#13;
&#13;
   7.       The structure of this economy is set out i n Table 1, i n which two&#13;
&#13;
   columns and rows have been l e f t blank because they are not being used for&#13;
&#13;
   the time being.    The final coluam and row around the border shav the total&#13;
&#13;
   of each row or column.     Within the border there are three entries, each of&#13;
&#13;
    them equal t o 1,000.  These constitute the SAM for Robinson Crusoe-&#13;
&#13;
   8.        In a SAM the rows represent incomings and the colucms outgoings.&#13;
&#13;
    For example, R w 1 which is labelled "Income," receives 1,000 from Column 4&#13;
&#13;
    labelled "Production."     In other words, Robinsones incosee derived from&#13;
&#13;
    production and equals 1,000.       Now,   turning t o Columa 1, we see the&#13;
&#13;
    corresponding entry 1,000 which represents the outgoings of incotne in Row&#13;
&#13;
    2, which is labelled "Demand." Column/Rw 1, i n effect, describe Crusoe's&#13;
i                         .&#13;
    role as income-earner&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9.       In Column/Row 2,    we look a t him as consumer.    H i s demand arising&#13;
&#13;
from income i n Row 2 is balanced by what he spends on production i n Column&#13;
&#13;
2 (Row 4).    The third leg of this process is in Row 4 and Column 4, where&#13;
&#13;
he turns up a third time as producer: his demand f o r production is 1,000&#13;
&#13;
and income arising from production is also 1,000.     These various identities&#13;
&#13;
could be s e t out i n the form of double-entry accounts, but, although not so&#13;
&#13;
apparent yet, the matrix is more economical since it requires one entry f o r&#13;
&#13;
each item, whereas conventional accour?ts require two.&#13;
&#13;
10.      It w i l l be noted that there is a circular process.       If one puts&#13;
&#13;
the three entries i n the table i n coordinate form with the row f i r s t and&#13;
&#13;
column second,    they would appear l i k e this:  (1, 4 ) ;(4, 2);  and (2,   1).&#13;
&#13;
Thus,  the matrix illustrates the circular process of demand leading t o&#13;
&#13;
production leading t o income, which i n turn leads back t o demand.&#13;
&#13;
11.       Of course, this rather complicated way of setting out the t r i v i a l&#13;
&#13;
structure of the Robinson Crusoe economy might well be considered much ado&#13;
&#13;
about nothing.     We present it this way, however, because it is so self-&#13;
&#13;
evident and can serve as an introduction t o the more complex relationships&#13;
&#13;
i n an actual economy.       In real l i f e Robinsoe Crusoe as a member of a&#13;
&#13;
society may, indeed, f i l l a l l three roles, as income earner, consumer and&#13;
&#13;
 producer, but he would do so as a member of different sorcs of units or&#13;
&#13;
 subdivisions,  according t o his function.       In the accounts for a whole&#13;
&#13;
 society,  income may be subdivided into many different categories, among&#13;
&#13;
 which income t o labor and income to capital are only the f i r s t tier.    That&#13;
&#13;
 income accrues t o a variety of domestic institutions, which are the source&#13;
&#13;
 of demand: households with different characteristics; firms; and government&#13;
&#13;
 (central or local).     The outgoings or expenditure of these institutions is&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
spread over a variety of products, as indeed Robinson Crusoe's must have&#13;
&#13;
been; production thus can be divided into as many sectors or subsectors as&#13;
&#13;
is desirable or practical.        In the next section, we turn to a description&#13;
&#13;
of a SAM which has been worked out f o r an actual economy.             Although&#13;
&#13;
progressive complexities are brought in, the fundamentals remain the same.&#13;
&#13;
Sri Lanka 1970&#13;
&#13;
12.      Among tho f i r s t SAMs constructed was that for Sri Lanka.         Sri&#13;
&#13;
Lanka is a cwuntry with a law average income per head, but an unusually&#13;
&#13;
equitable distribution of         income and high standard i n meeting "basic&#13;
&#13;
needs."   Raving successfully achieved a high quality of l i f e for such a .low&#13;
&#13;
income, Sri Lanka's need f o r more rapid growth of income and reduction of&#13;
&#13;
unemployment     implied  structural     change  and    it also   implied  better&#13;
&#13;
understanding of the existing economic structure.&#13;
&#13;
13.       A l l the data used i n this section are taken or adapted from one of&#13;
&#13;
the earliest publications documenting construction of a          SAM.^/  We s t a r t&#13;
&#13;
with a highly aggregated and simplified version, shown i n Table 2.       In t h i s&#13;
&#13;
table a l l s i x pairs of row and column are used, although one of them (3)&#13;
&#13;
has no entry i n the colum.        Apart from the border totals, there are now 11&#13;
&#13;
entries.    Two of the t i t l e s used i n the Xobinson Crusoe economy were not&#13;
&#13;
the conventional ones used i n SAM'S,        because i n such a primitive economy&#13;
&#13;
they would have sounded rather fatuous.             Column/Row 1 is now called&#13;
&#13;
"Factors of      Production"   and ~olumn/Row 2     "Institutions."    A word of&#13;
&#13;
explanation is i n order about these two fundamental ingredients of a SAM.&#13;
&#13;
 Factors of productj.on consist primarily of the labor and capital which are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-11 Pyatt, G., and Thorbecke, E. (1976). Planning Techniques for a Better&#13;
     Future, ILO, Geneva.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
used i n the process of production and receive income from it.                Rut the&#13;
&#13;
production process draws these factcrs from where it can, without being&#13;
&#13;
overly concerned with the entities t o which their owners belong.                It is&#13;
&#13;
these entities        which       constitute the  "institutions"  i n Colum/~ow 2.&#13;
&#13;
Foremast among them are households, which we may wish t o study i n different&#13;
&#13;
categories.       Households may supply labor and capital through one or more of&#13;
&#13;
their members, Sut act as n unit when it comes Eo spending the income from&#13;
&#13;
it. Other institutions are firms or corporations, both public and private,&#13;
&#13;
which provide capital.            A third type of institution is government, central&#13;
&#13;
or local.- It, too, may provide capital, but it has another important&#13;
&#13;
role i n the production process--at least as f a r as the determination of the&#13;
&#13;
value of prod~ctionis concerned--namely, the levying of indirect taxes.&#13;
&#13;
14.        The two new accounts 3 and 5 (i-e.,          the pairs of row and column)&#13;
&#13;
are there for different reasons.            The account for the Rest of the World (5)&#13;
&#13;
is necessary because Sri Lanka, though an island, is not an tsslztcd one&#13;
&#13;
l i k e Robinson Crusoe8s but has many transactions with the Rest of                the&#13;
&#13;
World.    The "Surplus or Deficit" (3) is a direct consequence of this; the&#13;
&#13;
current transactions are normally not equal and must be balanced by borrow-&#13;
&#13;
ing or lending or use of reserves.            Haw these two new qccounts f i t i n w i l l&#13;
&#13;
be explained i n a tour of the matrix.&#13;
&#13;
15.         We s h a l l s t a r t with the Production account (4).   In the row are&#13;
&#13;
the "incomings":         the proceeds of sales, a t producers    8 prices, of 11,312&#13;
&#13;
million rupees t o institutions within Sri Lanka i n Column 2 and of exports&#13;
&#13;
of 2,113 t o the Rest of the World in colunrn 5.          These are exactly balanced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-1/    It w i l l be noted that these are a l l domestic institutions.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
by the "outgoings" or cost of production i n Column 4:    i n Row 5 payments of&#13;
&#13;
1,067 for imports of materials going into production; i n Row 2 payments of&#13;
&#13;
885 made t o institutions during the production process, which are i n fact&#13;
&#13;
indirect taxes on intermediate goods or imported materials; and finally,&#13;
&#13;
the value added by factors of production of 11,473 i n Row 1.- 11&#13;
&#13;
16.        I f we move t o the income account (I), the 11,473 just referred&#13;
&#13;
t o   is now interpreted as income t o factors of production (again not&#13;
&#13;
differentiated as yet).     In Column 1we see rhe disposition of this income&#13;
&#13;
t o factors of production, consisting mainly of income of 11,360 accruing t o&#13;
&#13;
institutions i n Sri Lanka and the small balance of 113 t o the Rest of the&#13;
&#13;
World.&#13;
&#13;
17.        Moving now t o the third main account, for institutions, we have i n&#13;
&#13;
Row 2 two incoming items already mentioned: income from,factors of produc-&#13;
&#13;
tion (11,360) i n Column 1 and indirect taxes (885) i n Column 4 .     There is&#13;
&#13;
one additional receipt--trans£ ers from the Rest of the World (97) i n Column&#13;
&#13;
5.   The components of this w i l l be described later.&#13;
&#13;
18.        Column 2 shows hcw the receipts of institutions are spent.        I n&#13;
&#13;
Rows 4 and 5 there are goods and services purchased: 11,312 being the value&#13;
&#13;
of goods produced i n Sri Lanka, and 1,455, the value of goods imported in&#13;
&#13;
final form as opposed t o those used as materials i n the course of produc-&#13;
&#13;
tion.     In addition, 3.n Row 3, the deficit of -425 is due t o the fact that&#13;
&#13;
expenditure by institutions i n Sri Lanka exceeds their receipts.&#13;
&#13;
19.         In the course of this brief tour, we have now referred t o every&#13;
&#13;
item i n the two new accounts, 3 and 5, with one exception.,       This is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-11  A l l figures are i n millions of rupees.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
surplus of 425 in Row 3 of the account of the Rest of the World (5).     The&#13;
&#13;
latter's  source of income in the row exceed its expenditure in the column&#13;
&#13;
by this amount; the Rest of the World's       surplus exactly balances Sri&#13;
&#13;
Lanka's  deficit.   Consequently, Sri Lanka had to borrow or use its reserves&#13;
&#13;
to cover its deficit of 425 with the Rest of the World.&#13;
&#13;
20.       It is worth pointing out that the three largest entries in the&#13;
&#13;
matrix, by a wide margin, are in boxes (2, 1); (1, 4); and (4, 21, which&#13;
&#13;
were the only entries in the Robinson Crusoe SAM.     The core of the matrix&#13;
&#13;
is still the circular process of demand (2), production (4) and income&#13;
&#13;
(1).    Most of the remainder are required by the existence of the Rest of&#13;
&#13;
the World.     It is worth, at this juncture, noting the duality of this&#13;
&#13;
circurar process.     One can move round a circle clockwise or anticlock-&#13;
&#13;
wise.   If we go in the anticlockwise direction, corresponding to the order&#13;
&#13;
just given, we are implicitly followng the flow of money.          In (1, 4)&#13;
&#13;
factors of production (e.g.,    labor) receive money from production; in (2,&#13;
&#13;
1) institutions (egg., households) from factors of production; and in (4,&#13;
&#13;
2) production from institutions (e.g.,    households).  We may think of the&#13;
&#13;
other dtrection as the supply of goods or services: factors of production&#13;
&#13;
to the production process; production to institutions; and institutions (by&#13;
&#13;
a slight stretch of the meaning) to factors of production.&#13;
&#13;
21.       We can now give an exauple of how the SAM could be set out in the&#13;
&#13;
form of double entry accounts, of which there would be five.     For example,&#13;
&#13;
the production account:&#13;
&#13;
        Revenue (Row)                   Expenditure(Column)&#13;
&#13;
Domestic sales       11,312      Payments to factors of production    11,473&#13;
Exports               2,113      Indirect taxes (on production)          885&#13;
                                 Imported materials                    1.067&#13;
      Total          13,425                          Total            13,425&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22.     This is more or less the form of traditional national accounts.&#13;
&#13;
The complete accounts are fully articulated i n this double entry form i n&#13;
&#13;
the sense that each item i n one account apvears on the opposite side of&#13;
&#13;
another account.     It can be readily appreciated that, as the number of&#13;
&#13;
accounts is multiplied, their interconnections can become rather hard t o&#13;
&#13;
follow.  A SAM is more economical i n that it has only half as many entries&#13;
&#13;
as a series of      double-entry accounts, and the interconnections between&#13;
&#13;
accounts are obvious.&#13;
&#13;
Diagonal Entries&#13;
&#13;
23-      There are two modifications t o Table 2 i n the next version--Table&#13;
&#13;
3.   Both are diagonal entries: one a t (2,      2) and the other at (4,   4).&#13;
&#13;
Nothing else i n the table has been changed except, of course, the totals&#13;
&#13;
for ~ow/~olumns    2 and 4, which are each increased by the amount of the&#13;
&#13;
corresponding diagonal entries.&#13;
&#13;
24.      What meaning is attached t o a diagonal entry, which appears both&#13;
&#13;
as a revenue and as an expenditure to a particular account?      It clearly can&#13;
&#13;
only mean that,      i n one   case,  institutions  make certain payments    t o&#13;
&#13;
themselves or, i n the other case, production units do the same.     If we were&#13;
&#13;
only concerned with institutions or production units as a group, this would&#13;
&#13;
not serve much purpose.     But that is not the case.     In fact, we shall i n&#13;
&#13;
due course s p l i t both accounts into several subaccounts.      The diagonal&#13;
&#13;
elements represent the t o t a l of transactions between these subaccounts plus&#13;
&#13;
new diagonal elements within the subaccounts themselves, if they, too, are&#13;
&#13;
aggregations.&#13;
&#13;
 25      It should be noted that, by including diagonal entries, we have&#13;
&#13;
changed the meaning of the totals.       In Table 2, the total of Column 4 was&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                 -Table 3&#13;
                                      -&#13;

6.  Total&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the t o t a l value of a l l goods and services (value added i n Sri Lanka plus&#13;
&#13;
import content) produced i n Sri Lanka without duplication.            In Table 3, it&#13;
&#13;
represents the sum of        the outputs of a l l production units.          There is&#13;
&#13;
duplication i n t h i s sum t o the extent that one production unit s e l l s t o&#13;
&#13;
another; the diagonal entry is the amount of this duplication.              Similarly,&#13;
&#13;
the diagonal amount of 2,441 i n Row/Column 2 represents monies paid from&#13;
&#13;
one institution t o another.      Such transfers are a part of total incomes and&#13;
&#13;
t o t a l expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
Indirect Taxes&#13;
&#13;
26.         I n Table 4 we have made an i n i t i a l s p l i t i n the institutional&#13;
&#13;
account (i).       Instead of one line, there are now two:         2abc (foreshadowing&#13;
&#13;
further s p l i t s into 2a, 2b acd Zc), which we have rather lamely given the&#13;
&#13;
same t i t l e as before; and 2d, which is labelled indirect taxes.            Part or&#13;
&#13;
a l l of each of the entries i n the old l i n e 2 have been extracted and&#13;
&#13;
entered on line 2d.       Thus i n Column Zabc, the original figure of 2,441 has&#13;
&#13;
been s p l i t into two entries, 2,052 and 389; i n Column 4 the old entry of&#13;
&#13;
885 is now on line 2d; and the old entry i n Column 5 has similarly been&#13;
&#13;
s p l i t up.  The amounts so extracted from Row 2 have been replaced by a&#13;
&#13;
single figure equal t o the sum of the parts extracted- 1,368 i n Column&#13;
&#13;
2d.       Consequently, the tocal for Row (and Column) 2abc is the same a s&#13;
&#13;
before.&#13;
&#13;
27.          Why do we need a separate account for indirect taxes?            The main&#13;
&#13;
 reason is that they should be distinguished from direct taxes.             The l a t t e r&#13;
&#13;
 are extracted from the income stream and, therefore, constitute a transfer&#13;
&#13;
 t o the Government from other institutions.         Indirect taxes, on the other&#13;
&#13;
 hand,     are levied on expenditure by the f i n a l purchaser of goods and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
services or, earlier, on intermediate goods purchased by producers. In&#13;
&#13;
Column 2 of Table 3 the total cost of goods purchased at home(11,312) and&#13;
&#13;
abroad (1,455)  is p&amp; what the buyer pays.       Indirect taxes (or  their&#13;
&#13;
opposite, subsidies) must be added in (or subtracted).    The same is true&#13;
&#13;
for exports in Column 5. The symmetry with Column 4, where indirect taxes&#13;
&#13;
on intermediate goods or materials are clearly separated, should be&#13;
&#13;
evident.&#13;
&#13;
28.      At the same time indirect taxes which appear as an expenditure in&#13;
&#13;
Columns 2, 4 and 5 are also a source of revenue to the government (one of&#13;
&#13;
the institutions of Sri Lanka) and so appear in Column 2d on the&#13;
&#13;
appropriate Row (2abc).&#13;
&#13;
29.      Of course, indirect taxes are not an "institution" in any&#13;
&#13;
reasonable sense.   But separating them out has sufficient advantage in&#13;
&#13;
understanding the structure to justify a separate subaccount. The logic of&#13;
&#13;
the matrix is in no way altered.   The total still appears as part of the&#13;
&#13;
revenue of the government, while the parts are allocated to the relevant&#13;
&#13;
types of expenditure.   This is an illustration of the flexibility of a&#13;
   .-1-/&#13;
SAM&#13;
&#13;
Savings and Investment&#13;
&#13;
30.      Before proceeding to a subdivision of the various accounts, we&#13;
&#13;
will make one more change-   In Column 2 (or 2abc) expenditure so far has&#13;
&#13;
included all kinds of goods and services, whether for consumption or&#13;
&#13;
investment.   The change introduced in Table 5 in effeet separates consump-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-I/ Another way of dealing with indirect taxes, which may be preferable in&#13;
    some contexts, is to insert all of them into the production process&#13;
    (Column 4).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
tion and investment goods.   Column 2abc now becomes a true current account&#13;
&#13;
for institutions, and has been so labelled.&#13;
&#13;
31       The initial change is a reallocation between Columns 2abc and 3.&#13;
&#13;
We extract the investment goods in Rows 4 and 5 from Column 2abc and enter&#13;
&#13;
them in Column (3), renamed "combined capital account."     For example, in&#13;
&#13;
line 4, the entries in Columns 2abc and 2d--9,350 (consumption goods) and&#13;
&#13;
1,962 (investment goods)--correspond to the total 11,312 in line 4 of Table&#13;
&#13;
4.  The related indirect taxes similarly shift on line 2d.   There is also a&#13;
&#13;
small shift on line 2abc for institutional reasons which are specific to&#13;
&#13;
Sri Lanka and do not merit detailed explanation here.-I/&#13;
&#13;
32.      The total of all these changes in Column 3 is equal to expenditure&#13;
&#13;
on investment--namely, 2,639.   Expenditure in Column 2abc is now reduced by&#13;
&#13;
this amount.   The balance of -425, which formerly appeared on line 3, is&#13;
                                                         -&#13;
altered accordingly by the amount spent on investment to -425     +  2,639 =&#13;
&#13;
2,214.   This is now the difference between income and current expenditure&#13;
&#13;
or consumpticr, rather than income and total expenditure.     It constitutes&#13;
&#13;
the savings of demestic institutions.    Total savings derive from domestic&#13;
&#13;
sources (2,214)   and foreign (425).    These together finance investments&#13;
&#13;
(account number 3).  In double-entry form, the combined capital account is:&#13;
&#13;
      Revenue (Row)                       Expenditure (Column)&#13;
&#13;
Domestic savings     2,214          Domestic investment goods      1,962&#13;

     Certificates (FEECs), a system granting or charging a premium for&#13;
     foreign exchange, here applied to debt payments.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A General Framework&#13;
&#13;
33.        I n  Table  6 we have      divided     two accounts   (1 and   2)  into&#13;
&#13;
subaccounts.      The account      for factors of      production  (1) is divided&#13;
&#13;
according t o the two main factors:           labor (la) and capital (lb).      In&#13;
&#13;
account     number  2   the    three  main    s e t s of  institutions  have  been&#13;
&#13;
distinguished:      households (2a); corporations (2b); and government ( 2 ~ ) .&#13;
&#13;
Indirect taxes (2d) have already been separated i a Table 4.&#13;
&#13;
34.        There is l i t t l e t o say about the subaccounts for factors of&#13;
&#13;
production, which show income t o labor and capital separately.          Income t o&#13;
&#13;
capital is more than half the total, but, as w i l l be seen from Column lb,&#13;
&#13;
the greater part of it accrues directly to households.               This consists&#13;
&#13;
largely of income from small enterprises including farms, plus a substan-&#13;
&#13;
t i a l element of impute&amp; income from housing.&#13;
&#13;
35.        The entries i n the "box" bounded by Rows and Columns 2a, 2b and 2c&#13;
&#13;
are Zn the aggregate equal t o ihe diagonal entry (2,              2) i n Table 5.&#13;
&#13;
Payments between institutional sectors a l l f a l l into the category of&#13;
&#13;
transfers,     since they do not constitute income directly received from&#13;
&#13;
production.      They arise from a variety of causes: ownership of certain&#13;
&#13;
assets (e-g.,     debt or equity investment i n firms); direct taxation or&#13;
&#13;
government subsidies t o households (not related t o goods or services); or&#13;
&#13;
even voluntary transfers.         Payments t o the government include, of course,&#13;
&#13;
direct taxes by both households and corporations, but they also include&#13;
&#13;
social     security  contributions,    pension      fund contributions  (actual  or&#13;
&#13;
 imputed) and dividends and the l i k e from corporations (mainly public ones&#13;
&#13;
 i n Sri Lanka).     Payments by the government include pensions, interest on&#13;
&#13;
 the public debt and a substantial amount of direct transfers t o public&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
corporations.      The large payments from corporations t o households a t (Za,&#13;
&#13;
2b) are mainly payments t o owners of capital (debt or equitlr), although&#13;
&#13;
they include some private corporate pensions.&#13;
&#13;
36         It w i l l be noted in this table that, on line 4, there is no entry&#13;
&#13;
for consumption i n Column 2b (corporations).          Following standard national&#13;
&#13;
accounting practice, only households and the government consume.          Goods and&#13;
&#13;
services used by f i r m as inputs i n the course of production are included&#13;
&#13;
i n the f i n a l value of output; they are only consumed when the f i ~ e zztput&#13;
                                                                              l&#13;
&#13;
is consumed.        Firms may invest,     but their investments are included i n&#13;
&#13;
Column 3.&#13;
&#13;
37.        Some observations are i n order about some of the other accounts.&#13;
&#13;
First, we can see why account 3 is now labelled combined capital account.&#13;
&#13;
It combines the capital. accounts of households, corporations, government&#13;
&#13;
and the r e s t of the world.          In principle there is no reason why each&#13;
&#13;
institution should not have a capital account of its own.              I n practice,&#13;
&#13;
this was not possible i n t h i s case because of data limitations.        Later, we&#13;
&#13;
w i l l show an example of a disaggregated capital account i n another SAM.&#13;
&#13;
38.        The production account (4) has not yet been subdivided.         The blank&#13;
&#13;
lines suggest, correctly,       that it w i l l be i n the following table.      The&#13;
&#13;
princi-pal reason for not dividing it a t this stage is that we do not wish&#13;
&#13;
t o make too many changes a t once.        There is also a second reason.    The SAM&#13;
&#13;
i n its present form gives a l l the information necessary to compile the&#13;
&#13;
"Consolidated       Accounts  for  the Nation''    as    outlined under   the UNSNA&#13;
&#13;
systemLJ        The accounts i n t h i s form are as s e t out in Table 7.  They do&#13;

&#13;
l a t t e r  is therefore a more compact form i n which to present these&#13;
&#13;
consolidated accounts.       It is also perhaps more useful insofar as the&#13;
&#13;
interconnections between accounts are more obvious i n Table 6 than they are&#13;
&#13;
i n the double-entry format.&#13;
&#13;
39.           Each of the Consolidated Accounts can be identified with either a&#13;
&#13;
single column/row i n Table 6 or a combination of them.           The two accounts&#13;
&#13;
which correspond t o a single Column/Row can easily be compared.                The&#13;
&#13;
Capital account (c) corresponds t o Column/Row 3; the Rest of the World&#13;
&#13;
account (d) corresponds t o ~olumn/Row 5.           Outgoings i n the Consolidated&#13;
&#13;
Accounts correspond to columns and the incomings to rows.             The other two&#13;
&#13;
accounts are less easy t o identify,         since they correspond t o combina-&#13;
&#13;
tions.        The reader not interested i n the details of the identification&#13;
&#13;
which follows i n the next three paragraphs is advised t o skip t o paragraph&#13;
&#13;
43.&#13;
&#13;
40.           The Domestic Product and Expenc',i'cuce account (a) corresponds t o&#13;
&#13;
SAM accounts 2d and 4 combined with two adjustments.          In order t o s h w the&#13;
&#13;
correspondence,      we have reproduced Table 6       with only the entries for&#13;
&#13;
Column/Rows 2d and 4 i n Table 8.       The two w i l l be added together i n order&#13;
&#13;
t o make a combined rowfcolumn, but f i r s t   W-I?have t o make the two adjust-&#13;
&#13;
ments reEerred to. These are:&#13;
&#13;
        ( i ) The elements common t o both row combination and column&#13;
&#13;
              combination have been omitted; these are the figures 885&#13;
&#13;
              and 4660  i n Column 4 of Table 6.       Since they would&#13;
&#13;
              together form a diagonal element i n the combined column/&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
           row, they would appear on both sides of the account and&#13;
&#13;
           so can be . if t out.&#13;
&#13;
   ( i i ) Secondly, we have added an extra row and column, 7, whlch&#13;
&#13;
           does not appear as such i n Table 6.     The row corresponds&#13;
&#13;
           t o direct imports for f i n a l consumption and for invest-&#13;
&#13;
           ment (the figures 1091 and 364 appear i n Row 5 i n Table&#13;
&#13;
           6); the column has the t o t a l 1455 required t o balance the&#13;
&#13;
           account.&#13;
&#13;
41.        Row 8 is the sum of the eonbined entries i n Rows 2d, 4 an4 7.&#13;
&#13;
This row corresponds to the incomings o r left hand side of Consolidated&#13;
&#13;
Account    (a)   except    for  the  imports,     which  have,   i n effect,  been&#13;
&#13;
transferred, changing the sign, from the opposite side.          Column 8 includes&#13;
&#13;
these imports and the outgoings or right hand side of account (a).&#13;
&#13;
42.        The National Disposable Income and Outlay (b) -corresponds t o SAM&#13;
&#13;
accounts Za, 2b and 2c.       Table 6 has been reproduced with only these rows&#13;
&#13;
and columns i n Table 9, but eliminating the diagonal transfer elements&#13;
&#13;
between them.     Here we represent the t o t a l s by two rows and columns 8a and&#13;
&#13;
8b, instead of one, because, t n several cases, the simple addition of the&#13;
&#13;
elements i n a particular combination does not correspond t o an entry i n&#13;
&#13;
Consolidated Account (c).        For example, income t o capital i n Colum l b&#13;
&#13;
appears not as the sum of 4216 and 1535 (5791) but a s the difference&#13;
&#13;
between t o t a l capital income (5904) and capital income to the Rest of the&#13;
&#13;
World (113); that the two are the same is obvious from Column l b i n Table&#13;
&#13;
6 .   In Column 8b, the three elements of private consumption marked by an&#13;
&#13;
asterisk appear combined i n Consolidated Account           (b): indirect taxes&#13;
&#13;
 (119); domestic production (7701); and imports (1091) making a total of&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8911.   Once one has performed these arithmetic tricks, the elements i n the&#13;
&#13;
row again correspond t o the Consolidated Account incomings and the column&#13;
&#13;
t o outgoings.&#13;
&#13;
An Input-Output Matrix&#13;
&#13;
43.       The f i n a l step i n t h i s exposition of the S r i Lanka table is t o&#13;
&#13;
subdivide the production account (4) into s i x subsectors, which are listed&#13;
&#13;
i n Table 10 i n Rows 4a t o 4f.         The "box" formed by these rows and their&#13;
&#13;
equivalent columns constitutes the core of what is commonly known as an&#13;
&#13;
input-output matrix.      The accounts of each subsector follow essentially the&#13;
&#13;
same logic a s before.&#13;
&#13;
44.       For example,      i f we take the agricultural subsector (4a), the&#13;
&#13;
column i n t o t a l is equal t o gross output at produceres prices (excluding&#13;
&#13;
sales taxes and the like).          This t o t a l of 5,903 includes not only value&#13;
&#13;
added (in Rows l a and lb),     taxes on intermediates (in Row 2d) and imported&#13;
&#13;
materials (in Row 5), but also inputs from other subsectors.             The largest&#13;
&#13;
volume of inputs is a t the diagonal (4a, 4a) and therefore consists of&#13;
&#13;
internal purchases and sales within the sector;              i n fact, it is largely&#13;
&#13;
paddy (one subsector) sold t o ricemills (another subsector).&#13;
&#13;
45.       Just as Column 4a shows the sources of gross output t o which&#13;
&#13;
payments are made, Row 4a shows the destinations of gross output from which&#13;
&#13;
the production units derive their revenue:           i n Column 2a the amounts going&#13;
&#13;
t o consumption;      i n Column 3      t o investment;   i n Columns 4a t o 4P a s&#13;
&#13;
intermediate good^ t o other subsectors; and i n Column 5 to exports.&#13;
&#13;
46.       Table 10, with 85 entries i n it, is a long way from the pristine&#13;
&#13;
simplicity of the Robinson Crusoe economy.           The circularity of the process&#13;
&#13;
of   production-income-expenditure         is no longer so evident.        But  this&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
fundamental attribute of the SAM is still there.        This can be illustrated&#13;
&#13;
by reference to Input-Output tables per se. Table 11 shows an input-output&#13;
&#13;
table with six sectors corresponding to those i n Table 7.        Table 11 is the&#13;
&#13;
same as Table 10, with two exceptions.        The f i r s t , which is t r i v i a l i n&#13;
&#13;
substance, is that it has been rearranged.        Columns and Rows 4a t o 4f,&#13;
&#13;
which w e r e  i n the lower right corner now occupy the top l e f t corner;&#13;
&#13;
Columns and Rows 1, 2, 3 are now below or t o the right of them.                    The&#13;
&#13;
substantial difference is that the lower-rlght hand corner of Table 11 is&#13;
&#13;
blank.    The input-output table captures only the relationships between the&#13;
&#13;
production    accounts   and  the other    accounts   (factors     of production,&#13;
&#13;
institutions, capital account and rest of the world).         Inter-relationships&#13;
&#13;
between these accounts, most of which are i n the top l e f t corner of Table&#13;
&#13;
10 are not there.&#13;
&#13;
47.         If we were t o specify a new set of final demands different from&#13;
&#13;
those i n Table 11, techniques,       based   on specific assumptions about&#13;
&#13;
intersectoral relationships,     exist for deriving the implied pattern of&#13;
&#13;
production i n each subsector.       That implied pattern,        of course, w i l l&#13;
&#13;
include income t o factors of production (Rows 1 and 2).             The results,&#13;
&#13;
however, give no guarantee that there is any relationship between incomes&#13;
&#13;
generated and the ensuing demand- The complete SAM, in principle, provides&#13;
&#13;
the missing link--or a t least the data to establish it.&#13;
  .&#13;
48          Table 10 is as f a r as we    shall go here i n subdiriding the&#13;
&#13;
accounts.     In the original source, much greater detail is shown.            In one&#13;
&#13;
complete matrix, the following appear:&#13;
&#13;
       ( i ) Three labor groups (urban, rural and estate);&#13;
&#13;
      ( i i ) Three capital groups (public, private and housing);&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   (iii)  Three household groups (urban, rural and estate);&#13;
&#13;
    (iv)  Two kinds of corporations (private and state);&#13;
&#13;
     (v)  Eleven production sectors.&#13;
&#13;
However, still more detail lies behind that matrix.      For example, the&#13;
&#13;
production account is based on detailed accounts for 48 subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
Household data are based on information for six income brackets with each&#13;
&#13;
group.&#13;
&#13;
49.     This completes the first part of        this introduction to the&#13;
&#13;
exposition of social accounting matrices.  For those who may, unexpectedly,&#13;
&#13;
have been titillated by the subject, we have added one more section on a&#13;
&#13;
SAM for a different country, Botswana.     This illustrates an attempt to&#13;
&#13;
bring into the framework of the accounts not only the various transactions&#13;
&#13;
already described but also the financial counterpart of these real transac-&#13;
&#13;
tions and the flow of capital funds into investment-  In some ways this is&#13;
&#13;
one of the most intriguing uses of a SAM, as it brings together two related&#13;
&#13;
aspects of development, tbe real and the financfal.    The parsimonious use&#13;
&#13;
of financial data and the neglect of its relationship with the real econony&#13;
&#13;
have often been noted.&#13;
&#13;
Botswana 1974175: The Flow of Funds&#13;
&#13;
50.      Our purpose at this point Is to illustrate how to introduce&#13;
&#13;
financial transactions into a SAM.    The example we use is taken from a&#13;
&#13;
                                         ll&#13;
report on a SAM constructed for Botswana-&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
51.         The Botswana SAM shown as Table 12 is conceptually the same as&#13;
&#13;
Table 5 for Sri Lanka, subject t o three differences:&#13;
&#13;
    ( i )   There is no separate          line   for  indirect  taxes;  for&#13;
&#13;
            simplicity   they have been included with the Central&#13;
&#13;
            Government, which is i t s e l f included under institutions&#13;
&#13;
            ROW/CQPUUIU 2.&#13;
&#13;
     ( i i ) The combined capital account has been moved down t o&#13;
&#13;
             Row/Colunm 5 and the two accounts previously on lines 4&#13;
&#13;
             and 5 promoted t o 3 and 4, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
   ( i i i ) Wew 1ines 6 and 7 have been added.       One of them t o be&#13;
&#13;
             explained later has been l e f t blank for the moment.     The&#13;
&#13;
             other consists of errors and omissions.         Totals are now&#13;
&#13;
             shown i n Rows and Columns 8.&#13;
&#13;
52           The reason f o r not having a separate line for indirect taxes is t o&#13;
&#13;
avoid unnecessary clutter.        Having made the point once, we do not need t o&#13;
&#13;
repeat it.&#13;
&#13;
53.          The change i n order is net a change i n substance, since there is&#13;
&#13;
no magic i n any particular order.           The best order is the one that follows a&#13;
&#13;
reasonable logic and makes the SAM intelligible t o the reader.           About this,&#13;
&#13;
there can be differences.         The order here con£orms rather closely to the&#13;
&#13;
original, more detailed version of the SAM.&#13;
&#13;
54.          The account for Errors and h i s s i o n s is there for two quite&#13;
&#13;
different reasons.        The f i r s t s e t of errors is attributable entirely t o&#13;
&#13;
rounding.       Many individual figures in the original table have been added&#13;
&#13;
together t o form subaggregates; this inevitably involves rounding errors.&#13;
&#13;
However, there are several large specific errors, which appear as such i n&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the original SAM, mainly i n Row/Column 4 and 5.      These errors are akin t o&#13;
&#13;
residual   errors   often   l e f t i n the balance of  payments or national&#13;
&#13;
accounts.     A l lSAMs have such errors at some stage of their construc-&#13;
&#13;
tion.   How these particular errors arose and why they were l e f t i n are&#13;
&#13;
explained i n detail i n the original source.&#13;
&#13;
Purchase and Sale of A s s e t s&#13;
&#13;
55.      The main change i n Table 13 from Table 12 is that Row/Column 6 has&#13;
&#13;
been labelled Financial Account with one entry each i n the column and the&#13;
&#13;
row, apart from the Errors and Omissions.         In addition, there is a new&#13;
&#13;
diagonal   element   i n  Row/Colum      5.   These  are   basically     the  only&#13;
&#13;
differences.&#13;
&#13;
56.      A l l previous tables, whether on S r i Lanka or Botswana, have dealt&#13;
&#13;
with the consequences of current activity during the year, the production-&#13;
&#13;
income-expenditure cycle.        Savings are savings out of current income and&#13;
&#13;
the invest w n t they finance encompasses only new investment.       However, t h i s&#13;
&#13;
does not exhaust the totality of transactions.        Institutions may buy or&#13;
&#13;
sell ,existing physical assets, particularly land and buildings.         They also&#13;
&#13;
lend or borrow, creating financial assets or l i a b i l i t i e s as the case may&#13;
&#13;
be.  The new entrfes are intended to acknowledge these facts.&#13;
&#13;
57.       The diagonal element of 30.3 i n Row/Colum 5 expresses the fact&#13;
&#13;
that institutions bought existing assets of that amount and also that they&#13;
&#13;
sold them.    Obviously, the two must balance. When looked a t as an entry i n&#13;
&#13;
the column, the transaction appears as a purchase; when looked a t as an&#13;
&#13;
entry i n the row, it appears as a sale.&#13;
&#13;
58.       The new account (6) reflects a l l financial activities on capital&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
carried out by balrks and financial enterprises.-   The two new entries, at&#13;
&#13;
the intersection of Row 5 and Column 6 (127.3)  and the intersection of Row&#13;
&#13;
6 and Column 5   (126.6),  are identical except for the errors and omis-&#13;
&#13;
sions.  In principle they must be. They express the fact that institutions&#13;
&#13;
incur financial liabilities to the financial sector (for       example, by&#13;
&#13;
borrowing) and also acquire financial assets from that sector (for example,&#13;
&#13;
currency-or bank deposits).    These two must balance, since a liability&#13;
&#13;
automatically creates a corresponding asset.    They must balance in toto,&#13;
&#13;
but, as we shall see, they need noc balance for any individual subset of&#13;
&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
59&#13;
 .       We can now set out the capital account implied by the entries in&#13;
&#13;
~ow/Column5 in the familiar double-entry form as follows:&#13;
&#13;
         Incomings(row)                            Out~oings(column2&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
            Total        273.5                       Total             233.5&#13;
&#13;
Decomposition of the Capital Account&#13;
&#13;
60.      In Table 14 we have divided Row/Column 5 into three parts.      The&#13;
&#13;
first is labelled 5abc and includes the group of institutions identified in&#13;
&#13;
Sri   Lanka,  namely,    Households,  Enterprises (or   Corporations)    and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-1/ Current activities and new physical investments of these enterprises&#13;
    are already included as part of the accounts of "fnstitutivns."&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government; the fact that it has an "abc" a t the end foreshadows the fact&#13;
&#13;
that it w i l l be broken down still further a t a l a t e r stage.      The second,&#13;
&#13;
labelled 5d, consists of the new category of financial enterprises such as&#13;
&#13;
banks, which loom quite small i n the production processes we have hitherto&#13;
&#13;
considered, but loom much larger i n the' financial transactions that we are&#13;
&#13;
now considering.         They do, i n fact, represent the capital and money markets&#13;
&#13;
through which most of the financfal transactions take place.               The f i n a l&#13;
&#13;
element i n Row/Column 5e is the capieal account of the Rest of the World.&#13;
&#13;
61       The sales of existing physical assets are now identified (fiabc,&#13;
&#13;
5e) mainly as sales by institutions i n Botswana t o the Rest of the World&#13;
&#13;
and, t o a smaller extent, vice versa.        This is explzined by the Interest of&#13;
&#13;
foreign corporations i n mining enterprises i n Botswana.&#13;
&#13;
62.      W e see that individual accounts do not have to balance insofar a s&#13;
&#13;
the financial transactions are concerned.            Those who save may put their&#13;
&#13;
savings into real or financial assets.          Investors i n real assets may borrow&#13;
&#13;
i n order t o finance them.       This is the purpose of a capital market.&#13;
&#13;
63.       For example,          we can set out the capital account of        domestic&#13;
&#13;
institutions. other than financial enterprises to i l l u s t r a t e this point:&#13;
&#13;
          Incomings (row)                              Outgoings (column)&#13;
&#13;
Savfngs                           53.9      New investment (rows 2-4)           108.6&#13;
&#13;
Sale of physical assets           23.8      Purchase of existing assets           6.8&#13;
&#13;
Financial l i a b i l i t i e s             Acquisition of financial assets      53.7&#13;
   incurred                       90.7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Errors and Omissions              -0.5      Errors and Omissions                 -0.2&#13;
&#13;
              Total              168.9                        Total             168.9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64.          A similar account could be made for financial enterprises (5d).&#13;
&#13;
It would include rather modest amounts for savings and new investment (1.5&#13;
&#13;
and 1.4,       respectively).   The principal elements i n this account would be&#13;
&#13;
the entries i n Row or Column 6, that is, the sale or purchase of financial&#13;
&#13;
assets.         In practice, these are bound t o balance, except for the minor&#13;
&#13;
difference between savings and new investment, but, i n the table, balancing&#13;
&#13;
is achieved through Errors and Omissions.               This arises,  for example,&#13;
&#13;
because occasionally i n the year-end accounts or a borrower and a lender               ,&#13;
&#13;
a  l i a b i l i t y and  its corresponding     asset may be valued differently.&#13;
&#13;
Decomposing the Financial Transactions&#13;
&#13;
65.           I n Table 15, the account for financial assets and l i a b i l i t i e s (6)&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        11&#13;
has been broken down into four different categories: domestic currency;-&#13;
&#13;
bank deposits and the like; domestic borrowing or lending; and foreign&#13;
&#13;
borrowing or lending.        These are identified by Row/Columns 6a through 6d.&#13;
&#13;
66            A s   might be expected, institutions acquire additional resources&#13;
&#13;
(Row 5abc) by incurring l i a b i l i t i e s through domestic or foreign borrowing&#13;
&#13;
(Columns 6c and 6d).         To the extent that they do not spend these resources&#13;
&#13;
on physical assets (old or new), they retain them for the most part in the&#13;
&#13;
form of financial assets: either currency cr deposits (Rows 6a and 6b i n&#13;
&#13;
Column 5abc).&#13;
&#13;
67.            The   accoulnt of  financial    enterprises (5d)  is of    particular&#13;
&#13;
interest here.           I n presenting it i n the usual form of outgoings and&#13;
&#13;
incomings, we make a minor modif-lcation, changing t i t l e s t o "Changes i n&#13;
&#13;
Assets" and "Change in Liabilities," respectively.         We could do the same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-I/  Actually, a t the time there was no independent Botswana currency; the&#13;
     currency then circulating was the Rand.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for other capital accounts but the change i n this case brings out more&#13;
&#13;
clearly the nature of outgoings (acquisition of assets) and incomings&#13;
&#13;
(incurring of liabilities).   The account thus reads:&#13;
&#13;
Channe i n Assets (column)                  Chanpe i n Liabilities (row)&#13;
&#13;
Physical assets               1.4           Savings                            1.5&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
Domestic lending             14.5           Foreign borrowing                  5.7&#13;
&#13;
Errors and Omissions         -6.9           Errors and Omissions              -&#13;
                                                                              -9.6&#13;
&#13;
       Total                 23. 7                 Total                      23.7&#13;
&#13;
68.       Two itens appear on both sides of the account:         deposits, and&#13;
&#13;
domestic lending or borrowing.     There are a t least two reasons for this.&#13;
&#13;
Financial enterprises cover more than commercial banks.   , Some of them make&#13;
&#13;
deposits i n commercial banks.   These deposits appear a s a l i a b i l i t y t o the&#13;
&#13;
latter, but an asset to the depositing enterprises.       Secondly, financial&#13;
&#13;
enterprises may both borrow on the market and lend t o their customers.&#13;
&#13;
They, therefore increase their assets by lending and their l i a b i l i t i e s by&#13;
&#13;
borrowing.&#13;
&#13;
69.       The  account   is, i n   fact, analogous    t o the   change        i n   an&#13;
&#13;
enterprise's  balance sheet from one year t o the next,       except that it&#13;
&#13;
applies t o a s e t of enterprises.  Savings here correspond to the increase&#13;
&#13;
i n equity investment attributable to retained earnings.&#13;
&#13;
Decom~ositionof Institutions&#13;
&#13;
70.       In Table 16, the final one for Botswana, institutions have been&#13;
&#13;
broken down into the same three constituent parts as for Sri tanka:&#13;
&#13;
Households; Enterprises (or Corporations);    and Central Government.             This&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
has been done both f o r the current account (2) and the c a p i t a l account&#13;
&#13;
(5abc).&#13;
&#13;
71.               Except f o r the greater amount of i n s t i t u t i o n a l d e t a i l , there is no&#13;
&#13;
change i n principle from Table 15.                      However, t h i s new data now shows how&#13;
&#13;
each set of i n s t i t u t i o n s contributes t o the flow of c a p i t a l funds through&#13;
&#13;
the system.               This information shows,            f o r each of    the three s e t s of&#13;
&#13;
i n s t i t u t i o n s and, f o r the t o t a l , t h e changes i n assets and l i a b i l i t i e s .  I n&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
72.               Households, as is of ten the case, saved more than they invest i n&#13;
&#13;
physical            assets and,      consequently,        put    the difference        i n t o financial&#13;
&#13;
assets*             Xnterprises were the principal investors i n physical assets and,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-l/      Sales of existing assets have been brought over from the " liability"&#13;
        side a s a negattve item.             This is a net figure.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
since their savings (or equity participation) is only a small part, most of&#13;
&#13;
it had to 5e financed by borrowing.         In this particular year (1974/75), the&#13;
&#13;
role of the government was unusual, i n that it financed most of its new&#13;
&#13;
investment by the sale of existing assets.&#13;
&#13;
The Uses of SAMs&#13;
&#13;
73.     The effort required t o put together a SAM is not trivial.             Data&#13;
&#13;
must be ferreted out, wherever it may be available.            Conflicting sources&#13;
&#13;
must Somehow be Treconciled- Rows and columns do not conveniently come to&#13;
&#13;
the same t o t a l i n the f i r s t instance2'  What does one get out of it a l l&#13;
&#13;
except a rather complicated and impressively tldy collection of numbers?&#13;
&#13;
74-      Because social accounting matrices have not been i n existence for&#13;
&#13;
long and there are not many of them, t o say what they are useful for is&#13;
&#13;
partly  an exercise       i n conjecture.       Nonetheless,  there seems    t o be&#13;
&#13;
sufficient foundation t o make a few plausible suggestions.           In the f i r s t&#13;
&#13;
place, a SAM is clearly a step forward i n the upgrading of statistics.&#13;
&#13;
Recent comparisons of microeconomic information obtained from household&#13;
&#13;
surveys with national accounts have shown that the discrepancies between&#13;
&#13;
these two sources of information can be very large.              How do we choose&#13;
&#13;
between them?       Or,  perhaps should we ask whether we can choose between&#13;
&#13;
them?   While construction of a SAM is certainly not going t o reveal the&#13;
&#13;
ultimate truth, a t least it forces attention on inconsistencies in a way&#13;
&#13;
that brings one closer to the root of their cause.           Judgment, t o be sure,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-1/ Techniques exist for making adjustments t o achieve balance a t minimum&#13;
    cost in terms of variation from the original; and new or improved&#13;
    techniques are being worked on.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
has to be used in imposing ultimate consistency, but it can be done in such&#13;
&#13;
a way as to keep adjustments within plausible limits and so avoid a purely&#13;
&#13;
Procrustean process of fitting one set of data to the dictates of another.&#13;
&#13;
75.      The concept of a SAM goes further than the improvement of&#13;
&#13;
statistics for their own sake.  It could 3e said to be the common ground of&#13;
&#13;
economic planners or development economists on the one hand and statisti-&#13;
&#13;
cians on the other.    A SAM is cast in a form that, given the fineness of&#13;
&#13;
detail with which it is constructed, makes the most of existing informa-&#13;
&#13;
tion.   Economic models of an economy, which may be designed for quite&#13;
&#13;
particular purposes, nevertheless imply the existence of an underlying&#13;
&#13;
S M .  Parts of this implied SAM may be aggregated and parts highly dis-&#13;
&#13;
aggregated, but it is nevertheless a SAW.   The existence of an actual SAM,&#13;
&#13;
against which to test the behavioral assumptions of a model and the SAM&#13;
&#13;
they imply, is, on the face of it, a useful way of testing the modelos&#13;
&#13;
validity.   Much has been and could be said about the relationship between&#13;
&#13;
models and SAMs.-      Here we shall only touch on some of the simpler&#13;
&#13;
applications of a SAM to the understanding of the way in which an econony&#13;
     -&#13;
works&#13;
&#13;
76.      Uses of SAM can be thought of in two categories:     those in which&#13;
&#13;
the whole carpus of inforanation in the SAM is used; and those in which only&#13;
&#13;
a part is used.   Of course, in the latter case, it is not necessary to have&#13;
&#13;
the complete SA??.    But the construction of the complete articulated SAM&#13;
&#13;
means that one has at one's  disposal a multipurpose tool and does not have&#13;
&#13;
to construct separate subsets of accounts for each purpose ad hoe.        An&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-l/  Examples from the growing literature are de Melo (19791, Dervis(1978)&#13;
     and Dervis(1981).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
illustration of the use of part of a SAM has been documented in the case o.&#13;
&#13;
the Sri Lanka SAM which we have described in aggregate terms.  The purpose&#13;
&#13;
of the exercise in question was to establish the order of magnitude of the&#13;
&#13;
total fiscal incentives for exporting in various sectors.- At the time&#13;
&#13;
(in 1970) substantial direct fiscal incentives were given to encourage&#13;
&#13;
nontraditional exports.  At the same time, many industrial subsectors in&#13;
&#13;
Sri Lanka, among which, it might have been expected, would be found some&#13;
&#13;
potential exporters, received fairly high nominal protection-   The input-&#13;
&#13;
output matrix within the Sri Lanka SAM was used to convert nominal&#13;
&#13;
protection rates into effective protection rates to these industries; in&#13;
&#13;
most cases, these were substantially higher than the nominal protection&#13;
&#13;
rates.   The incentives in the tariff system that implicitly encouraged&#13;
&#13;
production for the domestic market could then be compared with the export&#13;
&#13;
incentives.  In many cases, they greatly outweighed the export incentives&#13;
&#13;
and, in a number of others, reduced them to fairly small proportions.&#13;
&#13;
These findings, which were unexpected, could of course have been reached&#13;
&#13;
without a SAM; its existence, however, m d e the task easier.&#13;
&#13;
77.      One of the principal ways in which the whole corpus of information&#13;
&#13;
in a SAM ;an be brought to bear is through multiplier analysis, which shows&#13;
&#13;
how changes in one or more elements of a SAM generate changes elsewhere in&#13;
&#13;
the matrix.  Here we will only ~onsidera very simple example to illustrate&#13;
&#13;
the approach.&#13;
&#13;
 78.     The starting point is to assume a simple economy and a highly&#13;
&#13;
 aggregate SAM which has accounts only for the private sector, government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-1/ The exercise is described in Chapter 6 of Social Accountinp for&#13;
    Development Planning, Pyatt, Roe and associates (1977).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
production, the rest of the world and a combined capital account.   To keep&#13;
&#13;
things even simpler, it is assumed that only the private sector buys goods&#13;
&#13;
from the rest of the world.      Corresponding to this simple economy, we&#13;
&#13;
assume we have a SAM for some base period, and ask the question:       what&#13;
&#13;
would  happen  if  demands  on  production  activities were   increased  by&#13;
&#13;
increasing government expenditure (by   an amount i2); investment (by    an&#13;
&#13;
amount i3); and exports (by an amount i5)?   Without loss of generality we&#13;
&#13;
can put the sum of the i's equal to 1.&#13;
&#13;
79.      The first part of the answer to this question is that whatever the&#13;
&#13;
processes of consequential changes might be, the end result will be a new&#13;
&#13;
SAM for our simple economy.   Moreover, those elements of the initial SAM&#13;
&#13;
which are zero by definition will remain zero.     Because our model assumes&#13;
&#13;
that only the private sector buys goods from abroad, the purchases of such&#13;
&#13;
goods by government, for example, will remain zero.-1/&#13;
&#13;
80.      Given the accounting rules and model assumptions, the difference&#13;
&#13;
between the new SAM and the original one will imply an incremental SAM in&#13;
&#13;
which many cells have zero entries.   This incremental SAM is shown as Table&#13;
&#13;
17.  At this stage we know the items i2, i3 and i5, because these are the&#13;
                                      '&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
changes which we have exogenously postulated.   We also know that the blank&#13;
&#13;
entries in the table are zeros, because these follow from our model and&#13;
&#13;
accounting conventions.   The question then is, what can be said about the&#13;
&#13;
non-zero entries apart from i2, i3 and is?&#13;
&#13;
81.      Vot much can be said about these non-zero entries without making&#13;
&#13;
further assumptions, e.g., about what will happen to prices, monetary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-11 Of course we could change the model and get a different result if we&#13;
    wanted to.  The purpose here is to give a simple illstration.&#13;

policy, and haw people choose to spend any extra income.       We w i l l assume,&#13;
&#13;
for simplicity, that private sector income goes up by an aaount M,       and then&#13;
&#13;
explore  what   the  incremental  SAM  i n Table      17  can  say   about    the&#13;
&#13;
relationships between M and the i's-&#13;
&#13;
82.      Because i n this simple model the private sector gets a l l its&#13;
&#13;
income from production activities, and because these activities pay a l l&#13;
&#13;
value-added t o the private sector, Row 1 and Colunn 4 of the incremental&#13;
&#13;
SAM are very simple and contain zeros apart from the entry i n Row 1, Column&#13;
&#13;
4, which is H.&#13;
&#13;
83.      The increase i n private income (Row 1) musr match the increase i n&#13;
&#13;
private expenditures i n Column 1. The l a t t e r must now be spread over the&#13;
&#13;
different components of private expenditures.        This spread is assumed to&#13;
&#13;
take plate i n the proportions p2, pg, p4 and pg which can be referred to as&#13;
&#13;
the marginal expenditure propensities of the private sector.     Since a l l the&#13;
&#13;
extra income M must be spent or saved,            the accounting balance for&#13;
&#13;
Row/Column 1 implies that&#13;
&#13;
                     P2 + Pg + P4 + Pg  = 1&#13;
&#13;
W e might also be prepared to assume that these propensities are constant.&#13;
&#13;
But i f we   do,  then this is clearly a behavioral assumption,           not an&#13;
&#13;
accounting rule.&#13;
&#13;
84.      Since Mpp    is the   only  increase     i n  income for   government,&#13;
&#13;
Row/Column 2 of Table 13 must have sums Mp2.       From Column 2, this implies&#13;
&#13;
that the entry i n Row 3, Column 2,      ice., the increase in government&#13;
&#13;
savings, must be Mp2 -  i2.&#13;
&#13;
85.      For now, we skip over the details of accounts 3 and 4 and move to&#13;
&#13;
 the rest of the world account, account 5.         Rere, the only increase i n&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
receipts is Mp5 because only the private sector buys imports i n this&#13;
&#13;
model.   This then implies that the entry i n Row 3, column 5, must be Mp5               -&#13;
&#13;
     This entry measures the extent t o which foreign savings or a reduction&#13;
i5.&#13;
&#13;
i n domestic reserves of foreign exchange finances the increased investment,&#13;
&#13;
i3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
86.      Returning now t o account 4, the fact that row and column sums must&#13;
&#13;
be equal implies that&#13;
&#13;
                      M = Mp4      +    i2 i3 i5= Mp4&#13;
                                          +    +            + 1&#13;
&#13;
or                    M = l/(l-p4)&#13;
&#13;
In other words, the value-added M tcust be equal t o the aggregate increases&#13;
&#13;
i n government expenditure,        investment and exports,       inflated by a factor&#13;
&#13;
l/(l-p4).   This factor is the familiar expenditure              multiplier, i.e.,     the&#13;
&#13;
reciprocal of the complement of the marginal propensity t o consume domestic&#13;
&#13;
goods.   Hence, while the SAM does not t e l l us what value t o give t o M or&#13;
&#13;
p4, it does show that once one is fixed, the other is also, and i n that&#13;
&#13;
sense  it defines    the     relationship       between    the i n i t i a l increments i n&#13;
&#13;
expenditure (the i's) and the increase i n t o t a l value added, M.&#13;
&#13;
87.      A t this stage we have discussed the balancing of four of the five&#13;
&#13;
accounts df the incremental SAM.            This is a l l that is necessary because it&#13;
&#13;
is always true that within a SAM the last account w i l l balance if a l l the&#13;
&#13;
others balance.   To i l l u s t r a t e this point, the rule requires that, for our&#13;
&#13;
account 3,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    i2 i3 is= (p2 + p3&#13;
                       +         +                  + p5) H&#13;
&#13;
Since the sum of the i's and the sum of the p's              are each equal to 1, this&#13;
&#13;
can be written as:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                  1 = (l-p4) M ,&#13;
&#13;
Hence the condition for account 3 to balance is the same as that for&#13;
&#13;
account 4, i.e.,&#13;
&#13;
                  M = 1/(1-p4)&#13;
&#13;
This result simply repeats that obtained previously.       If all but one&#13;
&#13;
account is balanced, then all accounts are balanced and the story of the&#13;
&#13;
incremental SAM shown as Table 17 is thus completed.&#13;
&#13;
88.     Application of multiplier analysis with a complete SAM is little&#13;
&#13;
different in priciple, though far more complex. It takes into account all&#13;
&#13;
the interactions within each step of the process of linkages between&#13;
&#13;
incomes, sxpenditures and production, e-g., the effects on other industries&#13;
&#13;
cf expansion within a particular industry.   There is, howe-:=r, no longer a&#13;
&#13;
single multiplier, but an entire matrix of multipliers, which potentially&#13;
&#13;
shows the effect of expansion in one cell of the original SAM on any other&#13;
&#13;
cell.  Row these effects are to be interpreted must always be approached&#13;
&#13;
with care since the effect of one variable on another ultimately depends on&#13;
&#13;
economic behavior and not just on accounting constraints.       However, the&#13;
&#13;
approach has some value in distinguishing accounts or subaccounts which are&#13;
&#13;
likely to be affected from those which are likely to be bypassed.   This may&#13;
&#13;
well have fmportance in considering the effect of exogenous changes on the&#13;
&#13;
distribution of income.     The analysis may also serve to %dentify the&#13;
&#13;
important elements in resulting changes in government accounts or in the&#13;
&#13;
balance of payments.&#13;
&#13;
89       Several different applications of this type of analysis have been&#13;
&#13;
made using the Botswana SAM.    In such applications the SAM relationships&#13;
&#13;
can trace the conplex interactions inherent in the circular process-      If&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
initial changes in prices or wages are involved, the analysis can show--at&#13;
&#13;
least in terms of orders of magnitude--how the initial changzs affect&#13;
&#13;
prices in different industrial sectors and the consumption patterns of&#13;
&#13;
different household groups; if interindustry relations are at all complex&#13;
&#13;
and if, as is more than likely, household consumption patterns are very&#13;
&#13;
different, the resultant pattern may be difficult to predict a priori.&#13;
&#13;
Such analysis, however, is based in the first instance on the assumption&#13;
&#13;
that patterns of production and consumption are unaffected by price&#13;
&#13;
changes.     Adaptation to take into account assumed responses can, however,&#13;
&#13;
be introduced. This, in fact, is of the essence in modelling an economy.&#13;
&#13;
90.         In a small open economy or a region, which is almost by definition&#13;
&#13;
a c m s l l open economy withi.- Tcountry, interindustry relations tend to be&#13;
&#13;
weak and leakages in the multiplier process large.            SAMs have been&#13;
&#13;
constructe'd in each of these contexts: for Swaziland, for example, and for&#13;
&#13;
the Muda Valley in Malaysia.-I/ In both contexts, SANS have been used to&#13;
&#13;
explore the implications of large development projects whose "downstream"&#13;
&#13;
effects on the national or regional economy were of interest.           Since&#13;
&#13;
interindustry relations tend to be weak in such cases, it is the pattern of&#13;
&#13;
household consumption that is most important in determining how large these&#13;
&#13;
downstream effects are and how they are distributed.&#13;
&#13;
91.         Construction of accounts for a region, as opposed to a country,&#13;
&#13;
are likely to reveal features of the regional economy that were little&#13;
&#13;
appreciated before.       This is obviously because regions do not possess&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
 national" accounts and other data normally associated with an economy as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-1/ See Bell and Hazel1(1980) for the Muda Valley SAM.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
whole.    The construction of    the SAM for the Muda Valley is a good&#13;
&#13;
illustration.   I n this region a large irrigation project had been carried&#13;
&#13;
out, more or less doubling the output of rice, the main crop.         Several&#13;
&#13;
features of the "downstream" effects of the resu?tant increase i n farmers'&#13;
&#13;
incomes are of interest.   Perhaps the main one is the very large o u t f l w of&#13;
&#13;
capital from the region Lo the rest of Malaysia.    This fact and other data&#13;
&#13;
i n the SAM are consistent with the theory that the principal downstream&#13;
&#13;
effect was t o increase the incomes of nonfarm households such as traders,&#13;
&#13;
who were i n effect "importers" from the rest of Malaysia.     Leakages from&#13;
&#13;
the regional economy were thus substantial.   It is perhaps significant that&#13;
&#13;
there was still a substantial number of poor landless laborers.      Although&#13;
&#13;
the SAM may have been constructed too soon a f t e r the completion of the&#13;
&#13;
irrigation system t o allow for opportunities for reinvestment i n the region&#13;
&#13;
to be taken up, it is, nevertheless,      a clear reminder that downstream&#13;
&#13;
effects can simply not be taken for granted.&#13;
&#13;
92.       CLearly no SBM can ever be constructed t o answer questions except&#13;
&#13;
i n the broad.  Specialists i n any particular subJect may have a much better&#13;
&#13;
idea of specific consequences, based on accumulation of intimate know-&#13;
&#13;
ledge.   But no one since Thomas Jefferson and his contemporaries can be a&#13;
&#13;
specialist i n everything.  A SAM can be used t o bring out what is likely to&#13;
&#13;
be important i n any given context and, therefore, to order the consultation&#13;
&#13;
of specialist knowledge t o the occasion.    A highly disaggregated SAM scch&#13;
&#13;
a s that reported i n Pyatt, Roe and associates (1973) for Sri kanka would,&#13;
&#13;
of course, be physically difficult t o reproduce on one sheet of paper.&#13;
&#13;
Even i f it were, it would be comprehensible only to a very limited group.&#13;
&#13;
The great advantage of a SAM is that one can select for any occasion those&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
parts of  it to be aggregated and those parts where detail is to be&#13;
&#13;
preserved.&#13;

Learninp bv Doing&#13;
&#13;
93.      Explicit reference has already been made t o the fact that there&#13;
&#13;
are more detailed accounts of the SAMs used i n this paper, which the reader&#13;
&#13;
can consult, if he wishes to dig deeper.        But, while further reading may&#13;
&#13;
give the reader a fuller taste of what a SAM          is a l l about, there is&#13;
&#13;
probably no substitute for learning by doing.        A do-it-yourself SAM does&#13;
&#13;
not have to be on the scale of the SAPZs described in this paper.       National&#13;
&#13;
accounts, balance of payments and financial data (such as the central&#13;
&#13;
bank's balance sheets and consolidated statistics for coomoercial banks) are&#13;
&#13;
often readily accessible and are sufficient t o s t a r t the construction of a&#13;
&#13;
rudimentary SAM, or even a series of SAMs for different years.         The data&#13;
&#13;
may appear Inconsistent or inadequate even t o do this; or other questions&#13;
&#13;
may crop up.   Once one s t a r t s asking questions about the data the closer&#13;
&#13;
one comes to appreciating what a SAM is for.&#13;
&#13;
94.      Data of this kind can often be found i n the appendices of World&#13;
&#13;
Bank reports.  The example shown i n Table 18 is taken from a recent report&#13;
&#13;
on the Yemen Arab Republic.        The SAM itself is only is only a f i r s t cut&#13;
&#13;
using eight tables i n the appendix for basic information and two others to&#13;
&#13;
make very crude estimates of the allocation of indirect taxes (Line 2b) and&#13;
&#13;
imports (Line 4) t o the two production sectors (Columns 3a and 3b).-          I/&#13;

-&#13;
11 The report i n question is entitled Yemen Arab Republic. Development of&#13;
    a Traditional Economy, a World Bank Country Study, January 1919. The&#13;
    tables used were Nos. 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1,    3.8, 5.1,  6.1, and 6.3 for&#13;
    the basic data and 3.4 and 3.5 to make the crude estimates.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
point here is to show how even a limited exercise can throw up question:&#13;
&#13;
both of substance and of consistency for further investigation.&#13;
&#13;
95.         There are 39 entries i n the core of the SAM and If totals (each&#13;
&#13;
appearing twice); of these, 26, including the rough estimates, could be&#13;
&#13;
directly entered i n the core of the SAM and 10 in the totals.        The rest       !&#13;
                                                                                  !&#13;
followed easily by simple addition or subtraction, making, it is true, some          I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
quite arbitrary assumptions about the location of small residuals;        there&#13;
&#13;
was one independent check on the outcome.&#13;
&#13;
96.         A special feature of the table is the Row/Column lb devoted t o&#13;
&#13;
remittances.     A large part of the Yemeni labor force was working i n Saudi&#13;
&#13;
Arabia and the Gulf States a t that      me. In the year in question, gross&#13;
&#13;
remittances (there was some reverse flow) were equal t o nearly 50% of&#13;
&#13;
factor income.       The proportions were changing extremely rap2dly;       the&#13;
&#13;
corresponding figure i n the previous year was less than 25X and i n thz&#13;
&#13;
following year over 752.     The response of the private sector t o this rapid&#13;
&#13;
increase i n their resources was t o save more than 25% (Column 2a).         Of .&#13;
&#13;
these savings, less than half was invested i n physical assets; the rest,&#13;
&#13;
plus a substantial amount of        borrowing,  was retained i n the form of&#13;
&#13;
currency and deposits with commercial banks (Column 5).      A t the same time,&#13;
&#13;
the government was borrowing abroad,        more than enough t o finance its&#13;
&#13;
investment ( i t too, accumulated funds i n the central bank, Row 8, Column&#13;
&#13;
6a).&#13;
&#13;
97.         Two other features of the SAM are the consequence of the form in&#13;
&#13;
which the data were available.      The public sector capital account has been&#13;
&#13;
s p l i t into budgetary and "other"   transactions (Row/Columns 6a and 6b).&#13;
&#13;
Government     expenditure  (investment  plus  consumption)  in   the  national&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accounts exceeded expenditure i n the budget.      Similarly, official loans or&#13;
&#13;
grants i n the balance of payments exceeded borrowing recorded i n the&#13;
&#13;
government budget.    There were evidently "government" transactions outside&#13;
&#13;
the budget, a large part of which must have been due t o investment i n&#13;
&#13;
public enterprises.     The division is intended t o draw attention to t h i s&#13;
&#13;
fact; some gratification can be drawn from the fact that the adjustments&#13;
&#13;
required t o balance the line and column were trivial.&#13;
&#13;
98.      Similarly, there are two subdivisions of the Rest of the World&#13;
&#13;
capital account.     One is for the official  - balance of payments.    However,&#13;
&#13;
again, there were additional transactions.      This was evident from the fact&#13;
&#13;
that there was an increase i n foreign assets (Row 7b) over and above the&#13;
&#13;
officially recorded reserves i n the central bank (Row 7a).        This has been&#13;
&#13;
balanced by a corresponding inflow of capital, here allocated mainly t o the&#13;
&#13;
private sector.     One residual i n the table is the inter5ection of Row 8 and&#13;
&#13;
Column 9.    This represents an increase i n deposits of the commercial banks&#13;
&#13;
with the central bank.      Obviously, thete should be l i t t l e difficulty i n&#13;
&#13;
checking t h i s figure, but our purpose here has s i m ~ l ybeen to present what&#13;
&#13;
can be done with a particular s e t of information rather than going beyond&#13;
&#13;
it.&#13;
&#13;
99.      The time invested was not large, about half a day of uninterrupted&#13;
&#13;
timeA/     Since this included the preparation of SAM'S for six successive&#13;
&#13;
years, it seems a small price t o pay for an articulated s e t of accounts,&#13;
&#13;
which reveals, a t least i n order of magnitude, the salient features of the&#13;
&#13;
economy.   It is at least arguable that six successive tableaux of this kind&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
,gThe   coapiler, moreover, had no previous familiarity with the country&#13;
    concerned.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
give a better appreciation of change--in this case kaleidoscopic change-&#13;
&#13;
than do individual tables of the traditional kind.     If this f i n a l exampl:&#13;
&#13;
strikes a mundane note on which t o finish, that may not be inappropriate.&#13;
&#13;
The SAM approach is a flexible tool which can be deployed with varying&#13;
&#13;
degrees of sophistication.     While economists have long since understood&#13;
&#13;
that their various analyses can each be s e t within a framework of accounts,&#13;
&#13;
this aspect has not usually been developed.     A s an all- purpose tool, SAMs&#13;
&#13;
can well be used for a variety of purposes, once an i n i t i a l investment has&#13;
&#13;
been made t o learn how.      The general point is that an economist who&#13;
&#13;
understands SAMs w i l l probably be better equipped t o tackle a variety of&#13;
&#13;
problems than one who does not.&#13;

            This paper is intended as an
            introduction for readers who have no previous familiarity
            with social accounting matrices. It assumes nothing more
            from the reader than a rudimentary knowledge of national
            income accounting. Starting from the simplest formulation,
            the paper introduces step by step many of the main features
            of a social accounting matrix in its fully developed and
            more complex form. An explanation is given of the
            relationship between social accounting matrices on the one
            hand and national accounts, input-output matrices and
            multipliers on the other.
