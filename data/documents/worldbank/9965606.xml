Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The rural water supply sector in Kenya has long been characterized by high contributions from community&#13;
members in finance, labor and materials, and participation in development and management. Perhaps unique&#13;
among East African nations, rural communities in Kenya are used to taking responsibility for at least some&#13;
effort required to secure supply of safe water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Water and Irrigation is currently leading a reform that will transform the sector into one that&#13;
recognizes the potential of these community service providers. Under the reforms, oversight is now vested&#13;
with seven regional water services boards and regulation with the Water Services Regulatory Board. The&#13;
boards are licensed to ensure water supplies in their areas and to identify suitable independent water service&#13;
providers who can enter into service provision agreements with them. Many of these providers are existing&#13;
community rural water supply projects that have proved their ability, over many years, to operate and maintain&#13;
rural water supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One of the key challenges for Kenya is to ensure that these water providers maintain services; we need to find&#13;
ways to focus efforts to support them operating the projects. In the past the district water offices provided this&#13;
support, but under the reforms this will likely change. It is clear that while the excellent services provided by&#13;
district water officers may continue to provide much technical support alongside existing private sector and&#13;
NGO personnel, the challenge is to ensure this support, along with other services such as financial planning&#13;
and community development. This support should be readily available to water projects at affordable prices.&#13;
This is also important in exploring commercial funds from domestic financial institutions for the community&#13;
water projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In short, there is a need to find ways to move support services toward becoming a market--where competent&#13;
community-managed water service providers can purchase professional services from a range of local&#13;
providers--to increase their own capacity and ensure service sustainability. Clearly, the water boards have&#13;
a critical role to play in financing and organizing this market and assisting water providers. This report&#13;
describes some of the thinking on how this market could be structured and what is needed to support its&#13;
development. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation is committed to ensuring that reforms are achieved as&#13;
quickly and efficiently as possible; providing support to water service boards and water service providers&#13;
can facilitate reforms to lead to improved service delivery. We thank all the contributors to this current report&#13;
and look forward to working together to develop the follow-up actions.&#13;

&#13;
 1. Contracting with funding Simple, funding agency retains control over                The water enterprise has limited or no&#13;

                                  through sharing costs between the water board&#13;

                                  down costs and raises quality. The water board&#13;
                                  can perform oversight and quality functions with&#13;
                                  no conflict of interest.&#13;
 5. Tripartite contracting        Maintains control and builds capacity of the          Can be complex and contracting&#13;

Who pays?                                                    financier. However, it prevents the water enterprise&#13;

There are two potential sources of BDS funding:              about contracting and getting to know the local&#13;
· grants from donor and public funds                         BDS providers and it is likely to limit competition,&#13;
· service payments by SWEs from direct revenue               leading to lower quality and higher costs. For&#13;
   or loans from financing institutions                      these reasons, many publicly funded schemes use&#13;
                                                             tripartite contracts with the funding agent, BDS&#13;
It would seem that the payment source would be               provider and the SWE.&#13;
perhaps the strongest driver of the contracting&#13;
arrangement. Schemes with development and                    When possible, even where subsidies are provided,&#13;
investment financed through funding agent may                financial mechanisms should be designed to&#13;
be suited to have BDS contracted through the                 promote high-quality technical support with access&#13;

     for scheme development could, in some cases,                   Trust Fund or financing institutions&#13;

     contracted from competitive BDS. This might                 A range of approaches can be appropriate, with one&#13;
     be the case where a competent professional                  caveat. With technical support services, health and&#13;
     water enterprise is looking to expand services              safety standards must be maintained. It is strongly&#13;

&#13;

     The rural water supply sector in Kenya has high          professional technical, financial and managerial&#13;
     levels of user investment. Rural communities often       support.Theseschemesresemblesmallenterprises.&#13;

     Communities generally seek technical assistance          management skill to function autonomously within&#13;
     from NGOs or from government staff who have,             the regulatory framework provided by the Water&#13;
     until recently, been based in district water offices.    Services Regulatory Board and the water services&#13;
     In a few cases, technical support comes from the         boards.&#13;

     communityorganizationsandsmallprivateproviders           their long-term sustainability and health, business&#13;
     account for water supply schemes in Kenya. Some          development support needs to be delivered in a&#13;
     rural schemes appear to have been financed with          way that the water enterprises have ready access to&#13;
     no public subsidy; many have been running quite          quality, affordable professional services throughout&#13;
     successfully for years.                                  the lifetime of the schemes.&#13;
&#13;
     Reform of the rural water supply sector has been         Much of the professional capacity already exists,&#13;
     under way for some time, transforming water supply       within the district water offices, NGOs and private&#13;
     and water resource management institutions. The          businesses in the districts. Many water projects hire&#13;
     reform is to improve the quality and sustainability      private technicians, accountants and management&#13;
     of water supplies by increasing the autonomy of          consultants to assist with planning and operating&#13;

     and oversight, from the seven autonomous regional        needed services are available from several private&#13;

            Reform of the rural water supply sector
            in Kenya is expected to increase the autonomy of rural water
            service providers. The role played by water service
            providers engaged in developing, managing and operating
            schemes is separated from the regulatory role of the Water
            Services Regulatory Board, and oversight functions by seven
            autonomous regional water services boards. The rural water
            supply sector in Kenya has significant user investment.
            Rural communities often mobilize substantial contributions
            toward the investment costs of rural water supply schemes.
            Technical assistance is often provided by Non-governmental
            Organizations (NGOs), the water service boards'
            district water offices, and in a few cases, the private
            sector. It is estimated that community projects account for
            around 3,000 water supply schemes in Kenya. These often are
            operated as small enterprises and it is clearly the
            intention of the reform that this should become the norm, a
            sector served by small water enterprises with sufficient
            management skill to function autonomously within the
            regulatory framework. To ensure their long-term
            sustainability and health, these small enterprises require
            Business Development Services (BDS) covering technical,
            financial and social skills. The support needs to be
            sustainable so that the enterprises can have access to
            quality, affordable, professional services throughout the
            lifetime of water projects. Considerable professional
            capacity to provide business support exists in Kenya and the
            new institutions have a major role in promoting such
            services. This paper examines the required business
            development services for rural water supply projects and
            institutional options for their delivery. It is based on
            analysis of the current situation and is informed by
            stakeholder consultation, including a national workshop of
            small water enterprise managers and operators.
