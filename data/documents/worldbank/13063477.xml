Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is a WSP project focused on learning how to&#13;
combine the approaches of Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), behavior&#13;
change communications, and social marketing of sanitation to generate sanitation&#13;
demand and strengthen the supply of sanitation products and services at scale,&#13;
leading to improved health for people in rural areas. It is a large-scale effort to meet&#13;
the basic sanitation needs of the rural poor who do not currently have access to&#13;
safe and hygienic sanitation. The project is being implemented by local and national&#13;
governments with technical support from WSP. For more information, please visit&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Project Development: Objective Results&#13;
Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is 3.5 years into implementation and is continu-&#13;
ing to build on the results delivered and outcomes achieved in each of the three coun-&#13;
tries. Through the Water and Sanitation Program's support to national and local&#13;
governments and the private sector, an estimated 8.3 million people have gained ac-&#13;
cess to improved sanitation facilities and are no longer defecating in the open.&#13;
&#13;
The project is on track to either meet or surpass intended outcomes in the states           The project is on track to either meet&#13;
of Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, India, and in East Java, Indonesia. In              or surpass intended outcomes in&#13;
Himachal Pradesh (HP), rural sanitation household coverage is now reaching                  the states of Himachal Pradesh and&#13;
                                                                                            Madhya Pradesh, India, and in East&#13;
more than 90 percent at the end of May 2010. In Madhya Pradesh (MP), 410&#13;
                                                                                            Java, Indonesia.&#13;
Gram Panchayats have been verified as open defecation free (ODF), representing&#13;
789,000 people, or 53 percent of end of project (EOP) targets. In East Java, In-&#13;
donesia, almost 750,000 people have gained access to improved sanitation and&#13;
nearly 1,400 communities have been declared open defecation free. WSP is con-&#13;
fident that more than 1 million people in East Java will gain access by December,&#13;
2010 and that the original target of 1.4 million will be achieved by the end of the&#13;
project, November 2011.&#13;
&#13;
In Tanzania, WSP is supporting government efforts to improve the implementation&#13;
and monitoring of rural sanitation programs. For the first time in Tanzania, the re-&#13;
sponsibility for monitoring gains in sanitation access has been clearly defined and a set&#13;
of core performance indicators in line with Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) defini-&#13;
tions developed. This is a tremendous accomplishment and lays a solid foundation on&#13;
which to build capacity at the village, ward and district levels in monitoring and data&#13;
collection. WSP supported the government roll out of a village registration system to&#13;
collect data on nine key indicators, including access to improved sanitation. Given the&#13;
lack of national level data, WSP cannot yet reliably report on the number of people&#13;
having gained access to improved sanitation facilities.&#13;
&#13;

To date, an estimated more than US$33 million has been spent by local and na-&#13;
tional governments in support of scaling up rural sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
In India, the states of HP and MP have strengthened the National Total Sanitation&#13;
Campaign (TSC) program by adopting key project principles advocated by WSP Dur- .&#13;
ing this reporting period, WSP India also provided technical support to the National&#13;
Government's TSC department in carrying out a nationwide assessment of good and&#13;
weak performers at the state level and identifying key lessons. WSP has also provided&#13;
support to the national government in supporting a participatory national-wide process&#13;
to develop a strategy for rural sanitation for the next 10 years.&#13;

                                              In Indonesia, in 25 out of 29 project districts, local government has taken over&#13;
                                              implementation from the resource agencies and are implementing CLTS activities&#13;
                                              using their own funds.&#13;
&#13;
                                              In Tanzania, the government is poised to pass sweeping legislation in sanitation&#13;
                                              and hygiene and, with WSP technical assistance, mandate that sanitation prog-&#13;

                                              campaign focusing on sustaining use. In Indonesia, CLTS triggering activities&#13;
                                              ended with the completion of triggering in the final eight project districts. In&#13;
                                              Tanzania, the complete marketing mix of the communications campaign was&#13;

                                              broadcasts. Nearly 550 communities in Tanzania received triggering events,&#13;
                                              bringing the total to more than 700 overall. The project team estimates that&#13;
                                              90 percent of the communities receiving triggering have expressed demand&#13;

Learning: Performance Management, Impact Evaluation,&#13;
Knowledge Management&#13;
While complete project learnings will not be available until late 2011 with the&#13;
conclusion of endline survey analysis, learning is embedded in all project activi-&#13;
ties and operational learning is being captured and applied on an ongoing basis&#13;
through formal and informal activities, including global and country-level per-&#13;
formance monitoring systems, impact evaluation studies, workshops, trainings,&#13;
presentations, and the development and dissemination of knowledge products. In&#13;
this reporting period, key insights were formulated around modifications to the&#13;
cascading approach for training and capacity building, strategies to improve dis-&#13;
trict and national level performance benchmarking, and the challenge of achiev-&#13;
ing sustained behavior change.&#13;
&#13;
The project's global results-based performance monitoring system continues to&#13;
provide important performance data on the core set of global indicators, which&#13;
the project management team used to identify key challenges and learnings dur-&#13;
ing this reporting period. In project countries, performance monitoring systems&#13;
are being used to build the recognition and capacity of local governments in&#13;
monitoring and reporting. In Tanzania, a recent assessment of the monitoring&#13;
forms identified several areas in which the project could strengthen the govern-&#13;
ment monitoring systems to create a solid foundation to monitor rural sanitation&#13;
based on JMP indicators.&#13;

Expectations for the Next Six Months&#13;
As WSP enters the last six months of implementation under the current grant, the focus&#13;
will be on strengthening government capacity in the application and use of the tools,&#13;
methods, and approaches developed during project implementation. In Washington,&#13;
DC, the management team will be working with the Gates Foundation on a second&#13;
grant to maintain the momentum of the results achieved in the current countries and to&#13;

                                             monitoring and data collection systems and processes. The team will seek to im-&#13;
                                             prove the motivation for reporting against national sanitation and hygiene targets&#13;
                                             at all levels. This will include working with the national government to raise the&#13;
                                             priority of reporting on sanitation and hygiene, providing feedback, comparisons&#13;
                                             and contracts on progress, as well as tools, guidelines, and technical assistance. A&#13;
                                             national workshop is being planned to help the government develop a strategy for&#13;
                                             improving the monitoring system. Further, a rapid assessment is being considered&#13;
                                             to collect data on improvements in sanitation in selected wards.&#13;
&#13;
                                             In India, WSP will continue to support the implementation of the TSC program&#13;
                                             in both states where the project has been implemented to date. Areas of focus&#13;
                                             include continuing to strengthen sanitation marketing; improving the sustain-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Globally and in each country, the knowledge management team will continue to&#13;
support country and global teams to produce and disseminate resources. Major&#13;
publications expected in the next six months include a project overview and a&#13;
Basic Guide to Sanitation Marketing, baseline reports, and research findings from&#13;
the study on the sustainability of sanitation marketing in Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
Enabling environment endline assessments will be carried out in all three coun-&#13;
tries by external consultants.&#13;
&#13;
WSP teams will continue to provide technical assistance to countries such as Laos&#13;
and Uganda, which are applying project approaches to strengthen rural sanitation&#13;
improvement efforts.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the project team will work to balance growing demands from other WSP&#13;
focus countries. Based on the experience of the project and the outcomes achieved,&#13;
WSP has made scaling up rural sanitation one of the main components of the&#13;
new WSP FY11-FY15 business plan. The current HQ and country-based project&#13;
team members will provide guidance to other WSP country teams in the design,&#13;
implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of large scale rural sanitation&#13;
programs.&#13;

             The Global Story&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is 3.5 years into implementation and is con-&#13;
tinuing to build on the results delivered and outcomes achieved in each of the&#13;
three project countries. As of the end of this reporting period (June 30, 2010),&#13;
2,300 communities have been verified open defecation free (81 percent of EOP),&#13;
representing an estimated 2.4 million people (54 percent of end of project target).&#13;
An additional 3,200 communities have self-reported that they are 100 percent&#13;
ODF and have applied for ODF verification (113 percent of EOP), representing&#13;
an additional estimated 5.9 million people (132 percent of end of project target).&#13;
Global targets for the number of communities achieving ODF and the number&#13;
of people having gained access to improved services are on track to be met by the&#13;
end of the project. Progress toward access to improved sanitation and achieving&#13;
ODF status is detailed in Table 1.&#13;

 *Tanzania is not currently reporting progress on access to improved facilities because the figures currently collected by district health workers cannot be fully verified. Both local&#13;
 government monitoring and reporting capacities across districts and wards, and data quality and completeness are inconsistent. The project is developing a plan to strengthen&#13;
 data collection by the end of the next reporting period.&#13;
 **In Tanzania, ODF is not a focus due to high sanitation coverage. Progress against the ODF indicator is therefore not tracked. Instead, the focus is moving up the sanitation&#13;
 ladder to improved facilities. Village registers developed by the project allow a community to make a declaration that they have fully covered their community with safe sanitation&#13;
 and hygiene facilities. The project will continue to support the district governments in implementing the village registers over the next six months and aggregating data up to the&#13;
 national level.&#13;

The project is learning and has changed. WSP is using a combination of ap-&#13;
proaches to change people's behavior through the sustained use of safe sanitation&#13;
facilities. To better understand the sustainability of behavior change, several re-&#13;
search projects were completed during this period.&#13;
&#13;
In Bangladesh, WSP contracted a firm to carry out a comparative analysis on the&#13;
sustainability of sanitation behavior, facilities, and programming in communities that&#13;
experienced open-defection free approaches in rural union parishads at least four years&#13;
ago. The study analyzed four approaches (CLTS; non-CLTS (led by NGO); Local&#13;
Government with Donor Support; Local Government Only) in a randomized sample&#13;
of 50 union parishads (out of approximately 450 that were declared 100 percent sani-&#13;
tized) representing the four approaches and different geographic areas. Data was col-&#13;
lected through a mix of qualitative and quantitative assessment tools: survey of 3,000&#13;
households and in-depth qualitative research conducted in 13 of the 50 union pari-&#13;
shads. Field work ended in April 2010 and a draft report is currently in review.&#13;
&#13;
In Vietnam, WSP collaborated with IRC International Water and Sanitation Cen-&#13;
tre and ADCOM, a Vietnamese consultancy firm, to investigate the long-term ef-&#13;
fects of sanitation marketing introduced into rural communes in Vietnam by&#13;
International Development Enterprises (IDE) between 2003 and 2006. The re-&#13;
search showed that three years after the pilot ended, access to sanitary toilets in the&#13;
pilot areas was still increasing, in part because of continued involvement by pro-&#13;
moters and providers. The study also revealed that one district had used its own&#13;
funds to scale up sanitation marketing activities across its communes. Research for&#13;
the case study was conducted from June through August 2009 in Vietnam and a&#13;
full report was released in April 2010.&#13;
&#13;
During this reporting period concerns were raised regarding possible discrepancies&#13;
between data collected as part of the impact evaluation study and data collected in&#13;
the project's Management Information System (MIS). The Bill and Melinda Gates&#13;
Foundation (BMGF) retained Mathematica, a consulting firm, to conduct a study&#13;
to provide additional clarification. Mathematica will pilot test in one district in East&#13;
Java (scheduled July 2010) followed by testing in six districts (scheduled August­&#13;
October 2010). In preparation for this study, WSP project staff in Jakarta con-&#13;
ducted a two-day briefing, providing feedback on Mathematica's data collection&#13;
protocols, and facilitating introductions to relevant stakeholders. It was agreed that&#13;
WSP's East Java coordinator will introduce the Mathematica team to the provincial&#13;
and district respondents, explaining that they were from the BMGF and not WSP,&#13;
but would not be present during actual data collection in order to make sure that&#13;
the assessment is independent and bias-free. WSP is proving support as needed.&#13;
&#13;
Key areas of learning that the project team hopes will be answered include:&#13;
   · to fully clarify whether there really are discrepancies between data from the&#13;
      impact evaluation and the MIS&#13;

        rural heads of household and their families. Formative re-&#13;

        good sanitation is something easily achieved and not just&#13;
        for the wealthy, as many assumed. In addition, sanitation&#13;
        improvements needed to be linked with improvements in&#13;
        status, convenience, and safety--especially for children. This&#13;
        led to the development of a marketing campaign, Choo Bora&#13;

                                                22 puskesmas had sent baseline and progress data through the mobile phone&#13;

        BOX 8: WORKING TO IMPROVE MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
        IN TANZANIA&#13;
        To address the weaknesses in the village-, ward-, and district-level&#13;
        monitoring and reporting processes, the project introduced village regis-&#13;
        ters: forms to be used by triggered sub-villages to help track sanitation&#13;
        improvements in line with JMP. The forms were to be filled out at the&#13;
        sub-village level and then fed up to the village, ward, and ultimately, col-&#13;
        lected by the district executive officer.&#13;
&#13;
        The success of the registers has been mixed, with some villages using&#13;
        them effectively and feeding the data to the respective ward level of-&#13;
        ficers, while others have not used them at all. Given the distances be-&#13;
        tween villages in Tanzania and the lack of reliable internet access, the&#13;
        project team believes that the main entry point for an effective monitor-&#13;
        ing and reporting system is the current institutional structures.&#13;
&#13;
        In the next few months, the project will be working with district, ward,&#13;
        and village executive officers to use their regular monthly meetings as&#13;
        a vehicle to collect data on sanitation improvements, share at ward&#13;
        and district levels, and discuss emerging challenges and needed sup-&#13;
        port. The project team is also working with national government to&#13;
        create demand and incentives for local-level monitoring of sanitation&#13;
        and hygiene improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In addition, the selection of a firm to define an economic evaluation methodol-&#13;
     ogy (cost-benefit and effectiveness analysis, or CBA) is underway. This CBA will&#13;
     be carried out for both Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation and Global Scaling&#13;
     Up Handwashing. During this time period, the consultants will develop the&#13;
     methodology and conduct field tests in three countries (Tanzania and India,&#13;
     along with Peru for the handwashing project). Note that the final CBA will not&#13;
     be completed until the final impact evaluation endline data is collected.&#13;
&#13;
     A knowledge product map was developed to plan the content, audience, and&#13;
     objectives of IE-related knowledge products; data access agreement forms and use&#13;
     protocols for researchers affiliated with the impact evaluation team were also&#13;
     developed.&#13;
&#13;

     Analysis of the baseline data was completed and a report has been distributed for&#13;

                                                   FROM MADHYA PRADESH, INDIA&#13;
                                                   In Madhya Pradesh, more than 80% of households resort to open&#13;
                                                   defecation, while just 6% use a simple pit latrine. More than 60%&#13;
                                                   of households had visible feces in the vicinity of the home, in large&#13;

                                                   on the ground. This disposal method is more prevalent in poorer&#13;
                                                   households (54%) than less poor ones (about 32%). About 87% of&#13;
                                                   households share their defecation facility or site with neighbors and&#13;
                                                   only 22.6% of households believe that their defecation facility or&#13;
                                                   site is safe for women to use at night.&#13;

        BOX 10: IMPACT EVALUATION BASELINE SURVEY: SAMPLE RESULTS&#13;
        FROM EAST JAVA, INDONESIA&#13;
        In Indonesia, about 40% of households defecate in the open, without&#13;
        even bushes for protection or bodies of water to wash the waste away.&#13;
        Another 38% of respondents report they defecate in rivers. In 25% of&#13;
        the cases feces were observed inside and/or around the dwelling and&#13;
        36% of latrines were characterized as either dirty or very dirty. (In 13%&#13;
        of cases, flooding was observed around the latrine.) The proportion of&#13;
        households using shared sanitation facilities is 58%, and is more com-&#13;
        mon among the poor than the rich (73% and 37% respectively).&#13;
&#13;
        Among the poorest households, 14% spend more than 10 minutes&#13;
        walking to their main sanitation facilities. In all, a rather high percentage&#13;
        of the female respondents (85%) feel secure using the facility at night.&#13;
        For households that actually built a latrine facility in or around the home,&#13;
        convenient location was the main reason, followed by health consider-&#13;
        ation. The majority of households reported high cost as the major con-&#13;
        straint for building the sanitation facility in the house.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     endline survey for May 2011, pending completion and strengthening of program&#13;
     implementation (scheduled to end in first quarter of 2011). Under these circum-&#13;

     grant's closure.&#13;

     Indonesia&#13;
     Analysis of the baseline data was completed and a draft report has been distrib-&#13;
     uted for comments (Box 10). Ten rounds of longitudinal data have been collected&#13;
     and analyzed. A short community survey was designed and will soon be imple-&#13;

There have been increasing reports      There have been increasing reports from Tanzania and Indonesia that suppliers&#13;

                                        One entrepreneur had even stopped taking orders for fear of not being able to&#13;
                                        fulfill them in a timely manner. In the past year, the project in Indonesia has fo-&#13;

                                        service points for sanitation. However, the IFC/CoWater study identified three&#13;
                                        other possible business models for further accelerating scaling up of supply. Of&#13;
                                        those models, the study recommends encouraging small and medium-sized enter-&#13;
                                        prises, such as district hardware stores, to enter the market by offering incentives,&#13;
                                        including exclusivity in operations for a period (e.g., through a concession type of&#13;
                                        arrangement). These suppliers would receive technical assistance and access to fi-&#13;

                                        marketing needs to go beyond the traditional mason model. A graduate student&#13;

                                            · The longitudinal measurements were halted. Analysis in India and Indo-&#13;
                                               nesia showed signs of underreporting and fatigue from respondents, with&#13;
                                               sharp declines in diarrhea prevalence that did not seem related to the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         · Due to the difficulties of measuring diarrhea, the project will focus on re-&#13;
           spondents' heights as a main outcome in accordance with recent research&#13;
           trends showing height is a good predictor of health-related outcomes. The&#13;
           project will invest in improved training and instruments for anthropomet-&#13;
           ric and age measurement in the endline collection. Team members believe&#13;
           this will help to improve the quality of measurements and lead to less vari-&#13;
           ability in the observations.&#13;
         · Measurements on the intervention will be reinforced to strengthen assess-&#13;
           ment, with additional focus on exposure and intensity. In India and Indo-&#13;
           nesia, a community survey and a rapid assessment have been drafted and&#13;
           discussed with survey firms to replace the remaining longitudinal studies.&#13;
&#13;
     Key operational lessons include:&#13;
        · The implementation of a robust impact evaluation creates significant ad-&#13;
           ditional operational burdens on the project management team (e.g., ad-&#13;
           ditional procurement, management and oversight of contractors, etc).&#13;
           The potential benefits of an IE need to be communicated to the proj-&#13;
           ect team and support provided to management to effectively coordinate&#13;
           implementation.&#13;
        · Defining and communicating the differences, and complementaries, be-&#13;
           tween an impact evaluation and a project monitoring system is impor-&#13;
           tant to do early on in project implementation. As the expected magnitude&#13;
           of impact is closely related to the intensity and reach of interventions,&#13;
           the impact evaluation relies heavily on data provided on reach and inten-&#13;
           sity from the project monitoring system. Processes should be defined to&#13;
           ensure alignment between monitoring and evaluation as part of project&#13;
           preparation.&#13;
        · In real world settings, demand-driven interventions create challenges to&#13;
           be true to treatment and control areas (India-HP and some villages in&#13;
           Indonesia) and can pose a risk to the design of the impact evaluation.&#13;
        · Repeated measurements may cause survey fatigue and underreporting by&#13;
           respondents, as was the case with the longitudinal rounds incorporated&#13;
           to measure diarrhea. Alternative outcomes could be pursued, such as&#13;
           height.&#13;
        · Quality of measurement. The outlier observed variability in some out-&#13;
           comes underscores the importance of investing in improved training and&#13;
           instruments for anthropometric and age measurement in the endline.&#13;
        · The importance of baseline collection to revise assumptions on statisti-&#13;
           cal power of the studies. One of the main purposes of baselines col-&#13;
           lection in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is precisely to reduce&#13;
           uncertainties and risks on final samples and to revise minimum detect-&#13;

   BOX 11: STRENGTHENING TRAINING AND CAPACITY&#13;
   BUILDING&#13;
   Rural sanitation programs at scale require devel-&#13;
   opment of a high-quality, effective cadre of human&#13;
   resources for implementation in a given host&#13;

   development of this human resource. A cascad-&#13;

            Global Scaling up Rural Sanitation Project
            : progress report (July 1, 2009 - June 30, 2010)

            Global Scaling up Rural Sanitation is a
            Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) project focused on
            learning how to combine the approaches of Community-Led
            Total Sanitation (CLTS), behavior change communications, and
            social marketing of sanitation to generate sanitation demand
            and strengthen the supply of sanitation products and
            services at scale, leading to improved health for people in
            rural areas. It is a large-scale effort to meet the basic
            sanitation needs of the rural poor who do not currently have
            access to safe and hygienic sanitation. The project is being
            implemented by local and national governments with technical
            support from WSP. This progress report is one in a series of
            knowledge products designed to showcase project findings,
            assessments, and lessons learned in the project. Finally,
            the project team will work to balance growing demands from
            other WSP focus countries. Based on the experience of the
            project and the outcomes achieved, WSP has made scaling up
            rural sanitation one of the main components of the new WSP
            FY11-FY15 business plan.
