            Project : case study on sustainability of rural sanitation marketing

        <abstracts>
            From 2003 to 2006, a rural pilot project
            was conducted in Vietnam with technical support from the
            non-governmental organization (NGO) International
            Development Enterprises (IDE) and funding from Danish
            International Development Assistance (DANIDA). The project
            tested whether a sanitation marketing approach could improve
            rural access to sanitary toilets in 30 communes in six
            districts of the coastal provinces of Thanh Hoa and Quang
            Nam. Research for the case study took place between June and
            August 2009. Local sanitation statistics were collected in
            all study communes. Semi-structured interviews were held
            with the promoters, providers, and some local government
            authorities. Interviews were held with district and
            provincial authorities and at a national level with the Non
            Governmental Organizations (NGOs), national authorities, and
            donors involved in rural sanitation. With the help of
            participatory tools, focus group discussions were held with
            sixty-one householders who had built sanitary toilets or
            upgraded their unsanitary ones, and sixty householders who
            had either no toilet or a still unsanitary one. Finally, the
            study team visited a very small and non-random sample of
            installed toilets to observe the quality of construction and
            hygiene as per the national standards of the Ministry of Health.
