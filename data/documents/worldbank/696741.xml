1. TRANSPORT BOTTLENECKS AND REFORMS'&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   The transport system in China has grown considerably over the last four decades.&#13;
Since 1952, the length of the highway system increased by a factor of nine and the length&#13;
of the railway network more than doubled. Despite this development, the transport&#13;
network is one of the sparsest in the world compared with the area and population it&#13;
serves. There is now a gap between transport supply and demand that is manifested by&#13;
the existence of transport bottlenecks, the administrative rationing of limited transport&#13;
capacity, the poor quality of services and losses to the economy.&#13;
B. TRAFFIC&#13;
1.2   China had experienced rapid growth of traffic during 1980-89 when the economy&#13;
grew at an average annual rate of 9.5 percent. Traffic growth declined when the&#13;
economic growth slowed down during 1989-90, as the supply constraints became more&#13;
conspicuous. However, resumption of high economic growth since 1991 has brought&#13;
about a corresponding surge in transport demand.&#13;
1.3   Traffic Growth.  Despite the capacity constraints and related bottlenecks,&#13;
between 1980 and 1993 the ton-km of freight have grown at 7.4 percent per year and the&#13;
passenger-kilometers at 11.8 percent per year. Highway freight traffic grew at the highest&#13;
annual rate of 13.7 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for railway traffic and 8.1 percent&#13;
for coastal and inland waterway traffic. Despite its rapid growth, intercity passenger&#13;
travel per capita in China remains very low, at about two thirds of the level for India.&#13;
This is due primarily to the severe capacity constraints. Civil aviation traffic is rapidly&#13;
expanding and has grown 20.9 percent per year since 1980, but still represents a small&#13;
share of total traffic with most long-distance journeys made by rail (Table 1.1).&#13;
1.4   Transport Demand and Modal Split Trends. Although the railway's share of&#13;
traffic has declined over the last decade as the share of road traffic has grown, rail transport&#13;
still dominates freight and passenger traffic in China. In 1993, 39.2 percent of freight and&#13;
44.3 percent of passenger traffic turnover were attributable to rail, with the remainder&#13;
moved by road, inland waterway, coastal shipping, pipeline, and civil aviation. The&#13;
movement toward a market economy will increase demand for market-responsive transport&#13;
services, favoring a shift to road transport but still leaving a growing market for the&#13;
relatively low-cost rail transport system.&#13;

and Management Issues, Options and Strategies, February 1994.&#13;

C. TRANSPORT REFORMS&#13;
1.5   In the past decade, China's economic reforms have aimed to increase economic&#13;
efficiency through measures designed to reduce national government intervention in the&#13;
production and distribution process, reduce the Government's deficits and subsidies to&#13;
state-owned enterprises, and open the economy by expanding trade and allowing further&#13;
participation of private and collective enterprises. In the transport sector, several reforrns&#13;
have been undertaken in line with these objectives-many with Bank assistance.&#13;
1.6   These initiatives are helping to spur the growth and modernization of the transport&#13;
system. However, much more needs to be done to bring about the changes required to&#13;
deal effectively with the emerging issues. To alleviate the transport bottlenecks and&#13;
rationalize the transport system, the Government will need to take the following measures&#13;
by the year 2000:&#13;
(a)   increase the total level of transport investment in relation to GNP, to expand&#13;
capacity to meet the new traffic demands and to clear up the backlogs&#13;
caused by past underinvestment;&#13;
(b)   aim for balanced investments among the major freight transport modes of&#13;
railways, highways, and waterways in terms of optimal economic cost of&#13;
transport;&#13;
(c)   realign further the prices of freight transport services and those of the major&#13;
commodities, especially coal, to bring them closer to their real costs;&#13;
(d)   increase further the productivity of existing transport assets through&#13;
technological modernization and management reforms; and&#13;
(e)   improve and expand the multimodal transport system, both across and&#13;
within modes, with particular emphasis on more extensive use of containers.&#13;
D. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
The National Highway Network and its Utilization&#13;
1.7   China's road network consists mainly of aging roads with neither the capacity nor&#13;
strength to carry current and projected future traffic. Many of the roads need upgrading&#13;
in addition to normal maintenance and rehabilitation. A Bank policy study on road&#13;
deterioration in developing countries classified China among the countries with an&#13;
extensive and obsolete road network in need of modernization to meet the rapid growth in&#13;
road transport demand.  Although China has not neglected road maintenance, its&#13;
outmoded maintenance technology would not be sufficient to arrest the accelerated&#13;
deterioration of the aging road system network. China needs to mobilize domestic and&#13;
external resources for modernizing its road system with special emphasis placed on&#13;
technology transfer, institutional improvement, and development of skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.8   The rapid growth of highway traffic stems not only from the country's rapid&#13;
economic growth but also from other factors such as the national policy of shifting short-&#13;
haul transport from rail to road as well as the expansion of the service sector and rural&#13;
industries. Furthermore, with the increase in foreign trade, growth in transport demand&#13;
will be concentrated in transport corridors serving the main ports and their hinterlands&#13;
and, with containerization of higher-value commodities, most domestic movements of&#13;
this foreign trade are expected to go by road.&#13;
1.9    Growth in the truck and bus fleet has been fairly steady at an average annual rate of&#13;
12.3 percent over the last 12 years, with particularly strong growth in small passenger&#13;
vehicles.  Growth in the tractor and motorcycle fleets has increased sharply, with&#13;
motorcycles showing the strongest growth of all vehicle types. The composition of vehicles&#13;
using China's roads is diverse, including a variety of motorized and a large number of other&#13;
(nonmotor) vehicles. The tractor and motorcycle fleets, for example, at 5.4 million and 6.5&#13;
million respectively, well exceed the size of the truck and bus fleet. Tractors and&#13;
motorcycles offer a relatively cheap and basic form of transport, but contribute significantly&#13;
to traffic congestion and are among the major causes of road accidents.&#13;
1.10  The trucking industry consists of publicly-owned trucks operated by trucking&#13;
companies affiliated with local (provincial or district) highway authorities, and other trucks&#13;
operated by factories, cooperative organizations and, recently, private individuals. The&#13;
relaxation of trucking regulations in the early 1980s allowed own-account trucks to haul&#13;
cargo for other factories and cooperatives and thus promoted competition between public&#13;
and own-account trucks. While market forces are expected to play a more important role in&#13;
shaping the industry in the future, it is necessary to understand the current constraints to&#13;
such development and to identify the measures needed to allow the reshaping of the&#13;
industry to take place. In order to explore these issues more fully, a Provincial Trucking&#13;
Study was included as a component of the Bank-assisted Henan Provincial Highway Project&#13;
and was completed in 1994, and a separate study of the trucking industry was completed by&#13;
the Bank in 1995.&#13;
1.11   Road safety is an important issue in the development of China's road sector, as&#13;
traffic continues to grow rapidly on all roads and a high-speed, national highway network&#13;
is developed. The frequency and numbers of people involved in traffic accidents have&#13;
reached serious proportions in China. The annual fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles in&#13;
China is 46, as compared with rates of 33 in India, 12 in Indonesia, 5 in Mexico, 9 in&#13;
Thailand, 18 in Hungary, and 2 in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom&#13;
(Table 1.2). However, the annual fatality rate per 100,000 population in China is the&#13;
same or less than that for developed countries. This reflects the low motorization rates&#13;
(vehicles per 1,000 population) in China.. The social and economic costs of these&#13;
accidents to the Chinese economy reached almost $1 billion annually.2&#13;
2 The costs analyzed in this case included loss of life, injury, property damage, reduced productivity, and&#13;
medical, funeral, and legal costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.12 Responsibility for highway safety matters was transferred from MOC and the&#13;
provincial Communications Departments to the Ministry of Public Security and its&#13;
provincial units in 1988. This decision created transitional administrative problems.&#13;
Cooperation between the provincial highway administration bureaus and the concerned&#13;
public security units is still weak. Under the Bank-financed Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway&#13;
Project (Loan 3929), a road safety manual and a safety audit system will be developed. The&#13;
Bank-financed Xinjiang Highway Project (Loan 3787) and the Guangdong Provincial&#13;
Highway Project (Loan 3530) contain pilot programns that address the traffic accident black&#13;
spot problem. The Second Conference on Asian Road Safety is scheduled to be held in&#13;
Beijing October 28-31, 1996. The Bank is discussing with GOC the possibility of holding a&#13;
National Road Safety Seminar in 1997, to be followed by a similar Provincial Road&#13;
Seminar in 1998.&#13;
Highway Administration, Planning and Finance&#13;
1.13  Administration of the highway network is the responsibility of the provincial&#13;
governments, through the Highways Bureaus of the Provincial Communications&#13;
Departments. The central government's MOC provides general policy guidance and&#13;
support to the provinces through its nationwide policies and regulations, specifying&#13;
design and construction standards.   However, the Provincial Communications&#13;
Departments are financially independent of MOC and carry out all road planning,&#13;
construction, maintenance, and operation of roads and waterways in the provinces.&#13;
1.14  While the provinces manage the country's highway network, MOC is responsible&#13;
for planning and investment strategies for the development of the National Highway&#13;
System. MOC has been evolving a long-term strategy for the systematic upgrading of the&#13;
national system in key corridors over a 30-year planning horizon. Known as the National&#13;
Trunk Highway System (NTHS), the system, comprising 12 major roads for the exclusive&#13;
use of motor vehicles (Map IBRD 27046) would connect all the provincial capitals and&#13;
cities with populations exceeding 500,000. Development of the NTHS has been accorded&#13;
highest priority in investment planning for the highway sector. Priority for early&#13;
construction is being given to two north-south corridors (Beijing-Zhuhai and Tonjiang-&#13;
Harbin-Shenyang-Qingdao-Shanghai-Fuzhou-Guangzhou-Sanya); two east-west corridors&#13;
(Lianyuang-Zhengzhou-Xian-Lanzhou-Urumqi-Houerguosi   and   Shanghai-Nanjing-&#13;
Jiujiang-Wuhan-Chengdu) and the three corridors of Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Shenyang&#13;
and Chongqing-Beihai, and to those routes already identified as congested and hindering&#13;
economic activity.&#13;
1.15  A system for funding highway construction and maintenance is well established,&#13;
although there are differences between provinces according to local needs and&#13;
circumstances. The main revenues are generated by the Road Maintenance Fee (RMF),&#13;
typically levied on the revenue of freight and passenger transport companies and on the&#13;
capacity of own-account vehicles. The RMF is levied by the provinces who retain the&#13;
majority of the monies after remitting a portion to Central Government agencies. MOC&#13;
also directly receives revenues from the Added Vehicle Purchase Fee, a supplementary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
earmarked tax on vehicle imports and sales, and uses these funds, which currently reach&#13;
about Y 2 billion/year, to contribute financing for: (a) the roads included in the national&#13;
highway network, providing a higher share of financing for the poorer, inland provinces and&#13;
a lower share for the richer, coastal provinces, and (b) construction or rehabilitation of rural&#13;
roads located in economically less-developed areas.&#13;
E. BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION&#13;
1.16  The Bank Group has supported initiatives by the Govermnent in the transport&#13;
sector through loans and credits totaling $5.6 billion for 33 projects (Table 1.3). The&#13;
dialogue between the Govermnent and the Bank Group on transport sector operations and&#13;
strategy has been strengthened through long-term strategy studies for railways, highways&#13;
and ports development, and through project preparation activities and project-financed&#13;
studies as well as sector studies carried out in collaboration with Chinese authorities. The&#13;
various studies have, inter alia, emphasized the areas of multimodal transport investment&#13;
and the setting of sectoral priorities based on systemwide economic evaluation&#13;
techniques.3&#13;
Transport Sector Work&#13;
1.17  Recent Bank Group reports on the transport sector include China's Railway&#13;
Strategy (No. 10592-CHA, February 1993), Highway Development and Management:&#13;
Issues, Options and Strategies (No. 11819-CHA, February 1994), and Strategies for Road&#13;
Freight Development (No. 12600-CHA, January 1995). In addition, studies on the&#13;
trucking industry and highway financing have been completed under ongoing projects, a&#13;
study of the provincial road construction industry is being undertaken under the Fujian&#13;
Provincial Highway Project, a study of interprovincial traffic facilitation and a highway&#13;
capacity study are being undertaken under the National Highway Project (Hebei/Henan),&#13;
a study of intercity passenger transport is being carried out under the Xinjiang Highway&#13;
Project, and a study of highway maintenance is being included in the proposed project.&#13;
In addition, a study for improved prioritization of highway investments and improved&#13;
highway feasibility study methodology is currently under preparation and is expected to&#13;
be completed by the end of 1995. A program for institutional strengthening of MOC is&#13;
being prepared and will be supported under a technical assistance credit (China Reform,&#13;
Institutional Support and Preinvestment Project-CRISPP, Credit 2447-CHA). The Bank&#13;
Group also conducted a survey of the national water transport system in the mid-I 980s,&#13;
which has reaffirmed the need to further exploit the large potential of the Chinese&#13;
waterways.&#13;
3 Six of the studies have explored multimodal pricing and investment issues in a more comprehensive&#13;
and more economically oriented analytical framework than was formerly available to China's&#13;
decisionmakers: the Guangdong Comprehensive Transport Planning Study (GCTPS); the Yangtze&#13;
Economic Zone Transport Study (YEZTS); the Coal Transport Study (CTS); the Railway Investment&#13;
Study (RIS); the Southeast Coastal Region Strategic Issues in Ports and Shipping Development Study&#13;
(SIPS); and the Price Reform Study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6-&#13;
1.18  On the basis of its project and sector work, the Bank has an opportunity to deepen&#13;
its involvement and assist the Govermnent in the design and implementation of institutional&#13;
and sectoral reforms in areas such as strategy formulation, investment planning, pricing,&#13;
financing, deregulation of transport services, operational efficiency, and transfer of&#13;
advanced transport-related technology through training and provision of up-to-date&#13;
equipment.  Chinese authorities and the Bank Group are currently preparing a&#13;
comprehensive transport sector strategy paper that is expected to help guide sector&#13;
development in a consistent, cohesive policy framework.&#13;
The Bank's Experience and Strategy in Highways&#13;
1.19  Of the 14 Bank-assisted highway projects in China, two have so far been&#13;
completed (the First Highway Project and the Shaanxi Highway Project). The former&#13;
project achieved its original objectives and demonstrated the benefits of improved&#13;
accessibility to economically less-developed regions. Economic activity in the area of&#13;
influence of most project roads surged and income levels increased noticeably.&#13;
Furthermore, the Bank's involvement facilitated the acceptance of competition in the&#13;
contracting for road works in preference to force account operations even for smaller civil&#13;
works contracts, as well as the merits of supervision of construction by specially assigned&#13;
units.&#13;
1.20 The Bank strategy for highway lending in the medium term is detailed in Highway&#13;
Development and Management: Issues, Options and Strategies. The strategy is to continue&#13;
supporting institutional development and sectoral reforms aimed at modernizing the&#13;
highway system and its management, and supporting investmnents focused on high-priority&#13;
links of the NTHS and the provincial road networks that feed into it.&#13;
1.21  While some institutional development and sectoral reform  components will&#13;
normally be included in every project, specific issues identified during the Bank's dialogue&#13;
with the government, will be addressed selectively in individual provincial projects. During&#13;
the next few years, the projects' investment components will continue to focus on high-&#13;
priority links of the national highway system, to support the development of the provincial&#13;
road networks, and to provide all-weather access to the poor areas to help alleviate poverty.&#13;
F. LESSONS FROM PREvious BANK OPERATIONS&#13;
1.22  Previous highway projects in China emphasize the importance of rigorous, early&#13;
preparation for major civil and traffic engineering works and for procurement processes,&#13;
where tendering often takes longer than expected. Advance preparation of bidding&#13;
documentation and independent design reviews have also fostered smooth&#13;
implementation and have helped reduce variations during the implementation period.&#13;
The design of traffic engineering facilities (traffic monitoring, telecommunications,&#13;
tolling and lighting) must be advanced so that these works would be finished shortly after&#13;
completion of the civil works for high-grade highways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
1.23  Land acquisition and resettlement of affected people have also led to&#13;
implementation difficulties, including delays, in Chinese highway projects. A large&#13;
number of people are typically affected by resettlement in China, particularly along&#13;
important economic corridors where highways are being upgraded and constructed. The&#13;
institutional requirements for resettlement of these numbers of people are significant;&#13;
under the proposed project, resettlement has received considerable attention to ensure&#13;
institutional capability to provide adequate compensation and to implement Resettlement&#13;
Action Plans.&#13;
1.24  Experience in the environmental area in China has generally been favorable.&#13;
However, more attention should be paid to environmental supervision during&#13;
construction, training of environmental personnel, and environmental monitoring during&#13;
both the construction and operation phases.&#13;
1.25  Bank experience emphasizes the importance of adequate construction quality of&#13;
roads. Poorly constructed roads lower economic benefits and vehicle operating cost&#13;
savings, and may reduce reliability and/or accessibility of the road. Higher costs also&#13;
result from premature deterioration, where corrective actions in the form of increased&#13;
maintenance and/or rehabilitation are required.  Construction quality has also been&#13;
highlighted as a sector issue for Bank highway projects. Effective remedial actions&#13;
include careful formulation of supervision arrangements, including engagement of&#13;
foreign experts, training of local supervision staff and equipping the supervision teams&#13;
with the necessary laboratory equipment, surveying instruments, transportation and&#13;
telecommunications facilities.&#13;
1.26  There is a growing concern that adequate funding for highway maintenance is not&#13;
now being generated to cover an expanding and more expensive highway system.&#13;
Previously, this was not an issue-adequate funds were being set aside for this purpose.&#13;
Experience with rural highways in Africa and South Asia and with the Bank's Shaanxi&#13;
Highway Project in China has shown that provision of basic access through all-weather&#13;
roads and provision of nonmotorized transport are effective means of reducing poverty in&#13;
rural areas, especially when combined with programs for socioeconomic development.&#13;
1.27  Based on the Bank's experience with institutional and policy aspects of highway&#13;
projects, the phasing of studies and technical assistance and the intensity of Bank&#13;
supervision are important for positive, sustainable outcomes. Institutional components&#13;
that are implemented early in the project period tend to have a greater impact, as&#13;
compared with free-standing studies carried out in the advanced stages of a project.&#13;
Systematic supervision and follow-up of the findings of studies and technical assistance&#13;
components by Bank missions also enhance project outcomes. Ultimately, the success of&#13;
the road safety component of the project depends upon the Borrower's commitment to the&#13;
objectives of the component and its ability to ensure effective coordination between the&#13;
Traffic Police and the Highway Department-the main two agencies involved in the&#13;
implementation of this component.&#13;

2. SHAANXI PROVINCIAL TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. SITUATION AND ECONOMY&#13;
2&#13;
2.1   Shaanxi Province, located in China's middle west, has an area of 205,000 km and&#13;
a population of 34 million (1993). The average population density is 162 persons per&#13;
km2, almost double the national average. Administratively, the Province is divided into&#13;
107 counties under 10 prefectures. Its capital, Xian, has a population of about 2.75&#13;
million. The climate is cold in winter and hot in summer, with an annual rainfall of&#13;
653 mm.&#13;
2.2   Shaanxi's GNP per capita is about 32 percent below China's average, and the&#13;
Province has large areas of poverty (Table 2.1). Shaanxi has the second largest number&#13;
of officially designated poor counties in China (50 out of 107) and the fifth largest poor&#13;
population (5.0 million or 6.25 percent of China's poor), 80 percent of whom live in two&#13;
northern and three southern prefectures. Lack of transport infrastructure is one of the&#13;
factors behind the depressed economic conditions in these areas.&#13;
B. TRANSPORT NETWORK&#13;
2.3   Shaanxi has a well-developed, transport network, heavily dominated by road and&#13;
railway transport (May IBRD 27047). The railway network in Shaaulxi includes the&#13;
Longhai, Baocheng, Xiantong, Xihou, Xiyan, Xiangyu and Yangan railway lines with a&#13;
total length of 2,149 km (in 1992). The Xian-Ankang railway line is now under&#13;
construction. Also, the Longhai railway line is being electrified. It is planned that during&#13;
the Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP), the Yanan-Shenmu railway line would be constructed.&#13;
2.4   The airline network of Shaanxi consists of five airports, of which Xianyang&#13;
airport (for Xian City) is classified as international, and is now being expanded. The&#13;
number of air passengers has increased rapidly (15.2 percent per year), from 140,000 in&#13;
1980 to 1,010,000 in 1994 (Table 2.2a).&#13;
2.5   The inland waterway system in Shaanxi provides a local service, with an average&#13;
hauling distance of 73 km in 1994. The province's major navigable river, the Hanjiang,&#13;
runs west to east across the south of the province. Because Shaanxi is an inland province&#13;
with short river estuaries, the role of inland waterways is rather limited. It transported&#13;
0.34 million tons in 1994 (Table 2.2b) or 0.1 percent of the total.&#13;
2.6   Shaanxi's highway system extends about 39,000 km (in 1994), which ranks&#13;
thirteenth in China. Of this total, 16 km (0.04 percent of the total) are expressways,&#13;
73 km (0.2 percent) are Class I roads, 1,387 km (3.6 percent) are Class II roads,&#13;
10,772 km (27.6 percent) are Class III roads, 19,286 km (49.3 percent) are Class IV&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
roads, and the remaining 7,522 km (19.3 percent) are unclassified roads (Table 2.3). The&#13;
administrative classification of the road system in 1994 was as follows:&#13;
km                         %&#13;
National                            3,999                         10.3&#13;
Provincial                          4,798                         12.3&#13;
County                             15,211                         38.9&#13;
Township                           13,164                         33.7&#13;
Other                               1,887                          4.8&#13;
ITtal                           39,059                        100.0&#13;
2.7    Highways provide a major means of transport in Shaanxi and are the only means&#13;
of transport for some areas. The density of the system is 18.75 km per km2, ranking&#13;
thirteenth in China. However, the highway network is not well-distributed in the&#13;
Province: it is dense in the central belt of the Province, moderately dense in the north and&#13;
sparse in the south. At present, 1,000 townships and 11,000 villages (concentrated in the&#13;
southern and northern parts of the Province) have no all-weather access to a road suitable&#13;
for motor vehicles. It is not surprising that these are also the main poverty areas in the&#13;
Province. Most of the network was built in the 1960s to low design standards suitable for&#13;
light vehicles and low traffic levcls. About 70 percent (27,096 km) of the roads are&#13;
paved, but the pavements are generally of low bearing capacity for the vehicles that&#13;
presently circulate on them. Due to the substantial growth in traffic volume and steady&#13;
rise in the use of heavy vehicles, these roads increasingly are becoming inadequate to&#13;
meet needs.  The provincial government is giving high priority to repairing and&#13;
strengthening these roads and to expansion of the highway network, especially high-grade&#13;
highways and roads to alleviate poverty.&#13;
C. TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS AND GROWTH&#13;
2.8    Over the period 1980-94, traffic has been rising strongly in all modes, with&#13;
growth rates on highways being significantly higher than those on railways. In 1994,&#13;
highways transported 87 percent of the passengers and 32 percent of the passenger-&#13;
kilometers and 87 percent of the freight tons and 18 percent of the ton-kilometers in&#13;
Shaanxi (Tables 2.2a and 2.2b). Railways carried a lesser portion of freight tonnage&#13;
(13 percent) and the largest amount of ton-kilometers of freight (82 percent), reflecting&#13;
the very long haul distances (1,263 km by rail vs. 41 km by road). Air transport, albeit&#13;
very small, is playing an increasingly important role in Shaanxi because of the increase of&#13;
foreign visitors to various historical and cultural attractions, particularly the Terra Cotta&#13;
Warriors Museum. Highway traffic, nevertheless, rose at high rates, 10.5 percent per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
year for freight ton-kilometers and 13.5 percent per year for passenger-kilometers (Tables&#13;
2.2a and 2.2b).&#13;
2.9   The increase in road freight and passenger transport is mostly related to the&#13;
improvement and upgrading of low-class roads. During 1980-94, the total length of Class&#13;
III and IV roads increased by about 890 km and 3,600 km, respectively. In 1980,&#13;
highways transported 46 million passengers, growing to 202 million passengers in 1994,&#13;
which represents an annual growth rate of about 11.1 percent.&#13;
2.10   Highway traffic includes slow-moving vehicles, mainly tractors of various sizes,&#13;
bicycles and other nonmotorized vehicles. In 1994, this slow-moving traffic accounted&#13;
for about 10 to 20 percent (in the converted traffic volume) of all motorized traffic along&#13;
major roads. Although this traffic is decreasing on main roads, it is still a major factor in&#13;
road congestion and traffic accidents. To tackle this problem, Shaanxi has started&#13;
development of access-controlled highways where traffic volumes are sufficiently high to&#13;
justify them, including the proposed high-grade highways.&#13;
D. THE VEHICLE FLEET&#13;
2.11 The total vehicle fleet has expanded rapidly (14.3 percent per year for motorized&#13;
vehicles) in the nine years between 1985 and 1994 (Table 2.4). During this period, the&#13;
fleets of medium- and small-size trucks, and buses and passenger cars grew by 41 percent&#13;
and 16 percent per year, respectively, reflecting the growth in prosperity and also the&#13;
light-vehicle needs of the growing number of smaller enterprises in the economy. Also,&#13;
motorcycles registered an impressive annual growth rate of 31 percent. Tractors, which&#13;
reached 256,000 units in 1993, are mainly used for agricultural purposes, but also travel&#13;
on the roads. This rapid growth poses particular problems to transport planners, in and&#13;
around the larger cities, especially the capital, Xian.&#13;
E. THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY&#13;
2.12  Road freight services have expanded significantly. Between 1985 and 1994, the&#13;
total volume of freight carried by trucks grew by about 6 percent annually, while freight&#13;
turnover grew by 7.1 percent annually (Table 2.5). During the same period, the share of&#13;
total freight ton-kilometers carried by private transport companies increased from&#13;
34 percent to 42 percent. The average haul distance for both public and private transport&#13;
companies remained almost stable for the past 10 years-about 60 km by public trucks&#13;
and about 30 km by private trucks.&#13;
F. HIGHWAY SAFETY&#13;
2.13   Road safety is a serious problem in Shaanxi, as elsewhere in China. In 1994,&#13;
1,604 persons were killed and 3,982 persons were injured in the 7,664 accidents reported&#13;
to the police in that year (Table 2.6). The relatively low number of accidents reflects a&#13;
low degree of police reporting, especially in rural areas. But the severity of accidents (the&#13;
number killed in relation to the total number killed and injured) is high. International&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
comparisons of the number killed in traffic accidents per 10,000 vehicles show that the&#13;
rate in Shaanxi is about 30 times higher than that for Western Europe and North&#13;
America..&#13;
2.14  While there is increasing concern about road safety, the Shaanxi Provincial&#13;
Transport Department (SPTD) has had less scope for action following the reorganization&#13;
of responsibility for road safety matters in China in 1988. Most responsibility for matters&#13;
affecting road safety now lies with the Traffic Police of the Public Security Bureau&#13;
(PSB), including that for vehicle testing and inspection, driver training and licensing,&#13;
propaganda on safety, enforcement of traffic laws, including imposition of fines,&#13;
operation of traffic signals, highway patrols, and all aspects of accident, reporting,&#13;
investigation and research.  However, SPTD retains responsibility for all matters&#13;
concerning safe highway design and traffic signs and markings. SPTD and the Traffic&#13;
Police would work together under the project to develop a modest program to address the&#13;
road safety problem in Shaanxi (paras. 3.30 - 3.31).&#13;
G. HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION&#13;
2.15  SPTD controls all highway undertakings in the province (Chart 1). SPTD reports&#13;
directly to the provincial government and acts as its administrative arm for planning,&#13;
budgeting and financing of highway transport in the province. SPTD conforms to the&#13;
general transport policy and technical guidelines issued by MOC.&#13;
2.16  The administration of the road network in the province takes place at three levels:&#13;
(a) Shaanxi Provincial Highway Administration Bureau (SPHAB) (Chart 2); (b) general&#13;
highway bureaus in each prefecture and city; and (c) local-level highway units of the&#13;
county highway bureaus. SPTD administers all highways in the province through&#13;
SPHAB. Apart from the high-grade highway, SPHAB is responsible for all highway&#13;
matters, including construction and maintenance, but receives professional and technical&#13;
guidance from the Engineering Administration Department of MOC. It has a staff of 200.&#13;
The 10 municipal and prefectural highway bureaus and local highway units of county&#13;
highway bureaus have a total staff of about 34,950 (or I person per kilometer), of which&#13;
technical personnel are 1,655.&#13;
2.17 The Shaanxi High-Grade Highway Administration Bureau (SHGHAB) (Chart 3)&#13;
was established in 1989 and is under the administration of SPTD. SHGHAB has 100&#13;
headquarters staff and is responsible for construction, maintenance and operation of high-&#13;
grade highways in the province.  Specifically, it is in charge of three highway&#13;
management departments: Xian-Tongchuan Highway, Xian-Weinan Highway and Xian-&#13;
Baoji Highway. It currently has a staff of about 580 in these three department offices.&#13;
H. PLANNING, BUDGETING AND FINANCING&#13;
2.18  Planning. SPTD has overall responsibility for planning, construction, operation&#13;
and maintenance of the provincial highway network. The prefectural and county&#13;
authorities have considerable autonomy in planning smaller road investments, but the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
planning of trunk roads is subject to the approval of SPTD. Each administrative group&#13;
prepares investment plans for the highway network under its jurisdiction and submits&#13;
them to the planning division of SPTD by September of each year for the next year's&#13;
plan. SPTD approves the next year's plan for each county or local authority concerned&#13;
before the end of March. Similarly, using inputs from lower-level administrative groups,&#13;
SPTD prepares the five-year road development plan, reflecting national or provincial&#13;
development policy guidelines and objectives. After review and approval by Shaanxi&#13;
Provincial Government (SPG), the plans are implemented.&#13;
2.19 Budgeting. In common with other provincial communications departments in&#13;
China, SPTD's planning division adopts a balanced budget policy. The proposed&#13;
highway expenditures are balanced against the revenues earmarked for highway&#13;
development; the amount of investment approved for each year is closely related to the&#13;
revenues expected for the same year. The necessary adjustments are made after October&#13;
of the same year.&#13;
2.20 Financing. Highway funding sources and expenditures are summarized in Table&#13;
2.7. Data for 1994 are displayed in Figure 2.1. The largest source of finance is the road&#13;
maintenance fee (RMF), accounting for 36.7 percent of the total for the province in 1994.&#13;
SPTD retains 72.5 per cent of revenues from RMF.&#13;

2.21   Other sources of revenue include grants from MOC, (13.5 percent of total) in&#13;
1994, and various sources of self-raised funds (49.8 percent). The province also raises&#13;
highway funds by adding a passenger tariff surcharge, currently Y 0.01 per passenger-km.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
The amounts collected from this source are used mainly for the construction of bus&#13;
terminals.&#13;
2.22  In addition to road user charges discussed above, fuel taxes are levied by MOF&#13;
but are not allocated back to highway funding. Fuel taxes currently amount to 43 percent&#13;
of the base price of gasoline and 13 percent of the base price of diesel fuels. Total fuel&#13;
prices, including taxes, are significantly higher than international market prices, both for&#13;
planned allocations and for open-market consumption (Table 2.8).&#13;
I. ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
2.23  Engineering. Road and bridge projects are designed by the planning and design&#13;
institutes at the provincial, prefectural and county levels. The Shaanxi Provincial&#13;
Highway Survey and Design Institute (SPHSDI) (Chart 4) is qualified for Class I roads&#13;
and expressways and is responsible for all major road, bridge and tunnel projects.&#13;
SPHSDI is competent and has qualified and experienced personnel, as well as equipment.&#13;
The design institutes at the municipal and county levels are responsible for lower-grade&#13;
county and township road design works.  These design institutes are, in general,&#13;
competent and have experienced personnel for carrying out their respective highway&#13;
design tasks.&#13;
2.24  Construction Supervision. The Quality Control Center under SPTD, established&#13;
in 1988, is responsible for quality testing, bidding, and overall supervision of all transport&#13;
projects in Shaanxi on behalf of SPG. The Quota Center under SPTD, established in&#13;
1990, is in charge of auditing the project costs of all transport projects in Shaanxi, and&#13;
takes part in the feasibility study, project assessment and budget compilation. Generally,&#13;
these centers have relatively competent personnel to supervise and audit the works&#13;
adequately.&#13;
2.25 Construction. The Shaanxi Provincial Road and Bridge Company (SPRBC) is&#13;
mainly responsible for the construction of key highway projects, especially high-standard&#13;
highways and large bridges in Shaanxi. The municipal and county highway bureaus have&#13;
their own construction units to carry out construction of minor projects within their&#13;
administrative districts.  However, in recent years, competitive bidding has been&#13;
introduced in the province, following the SPC directive that all major civil works be&#13;
awarded after competitive bidding. Many of the larger regional and urban construction&#13;
bureaus, railway engineering and mining engineering units have been reorganized into&#13;
financially independent contracting companies. Thus, the construction units under the&#13;
communications departments of the various cities and provinces can also participate in&#13;
transprovincial bidding activities. Contractors for 17 civil works contract sections for the&#13;
proposed high-grade highways will be selected through prequalification and international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB) (para. 3.61).&#13;
2.26 Maintenance. Highway maintenance is carried out by county highway bureaus&#13;
under the control of municipal authorities. Presently, the methods of maintenance work&#13;
are generally labor-intensive. Out of the total 39,059 km (as of 1994) highway network&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
in Shaanxi, about 27,000 km (70 percent of the total) are paved and 58 percent are all-&#13;
weather roads. But the pavements are of low bearing capacity for the vehicles. The high-&#13;
grade highways are maintained by SHGHAB, and other highways by SPHAB. The main&#13;
maintenance problem has been the poor riding quality of road surfaces stemming from&#13;
labor-intensive and low-technology practices. Most of the pavements have exceeded&#13;
their design life and need major overhaul. Also, overloading of trucks and tractors is a&#13;
serious problem, which accelerates deterioration of the pavement. The quality of road&#13;
maintenance will be addressed under the proposed project through a study of highway&#13;
maintenance (para. 3.29), provision of maintenance equipment (para. 3.24), and training&#13;
of personnel involved in the management and execution of maintenance activities (para.&#13;
3.33).&#13;
J. TRAINING&#13;
2.27  The staff of SPTD are, in general, experienced, but have not been exposed to new&#13;
technology and therefore often use outmoded work methods and equipment. The staff of&#13;
SPTD have benefited from the training provided under the completed Bank-financed&#13;
Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project (Loan 2952-CHA). The proposed project will&#13;
support the training efforts of SPTD by (a) providing training to personnel of the relevant&#13;
institutes and schools; (b) strengthening the basic administrative and operational&#13;
functions of SPTD; (c) strengthening maintenance planning and its implementation,&#13;
which involves the management of maintenance organization and equipment, the&#13;
collection of traffic data, and the establishment of a road data bank; through training of&#13;
their staff and provision of modem equipment.&#13;
K. HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.28  Shaanxi's investments in highways have increased from Y 2.51 billion during the&#13;
7FYP to Y 6.14 billion during the 8FYP (1991-95). The details of the highway network&#13;
expansion over the 8FYP and 9FYP are shown in Table 2.7.&#13;
2.29  The highway development plans of Shaanxi set goals for three different time&#13;
horizons: long term up to the year 2020, medium term up to 2010 and short term up to&#13;
the year 2000. The short-term plans for highway development are embodied in the 9FYP&#13;
for Shaanxi (Tables 2.9 and 2.10). By the year 2000, it is anticipated that 130 km of new&#13;
expressways, 110 km of new Class I highways, 140 km of new Class II auto-only&#13;
highways and 790 km of new general Class II highways would be constructed. Also,&#13;
about 4,900 km of county and township roads would be rehabilitated or constructed on&#13;
new right-of-way.&#13;
2.30  The most serious problem for realizing the planned developments by the year&#13;
2000 would be the availability of the required financial resources. SPTD's 9FYP calls&#13;
for expenditures of about Y 14.08 billion and revenues of about Y 12.24 billion, or a&#13;
shortage of about Y 1.84 billion. The expenditures include Y 5.64 billion for new&#13;
construction (including high-grade highways), Y 3.16 billion for rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading of existing roads; Y 0.64 billion for periodic maintenance and Y 0.69 billion or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
routine maintenance. The expected deficit is expected to be met from: (a) sale of land&#13;
(Y 120 million); (b) fees on coal and oil transport (Y 200 million); (c) increase in fees on&#13;
transport of passengers (Y 200 million); (d) sale of operating rights of some of the&#13;
completed high-grade highways (Y 400 million); (e) adoption of build-operate-transfer&#13;
(BOT) schemes for three new tunnels (Y 400 million); (f) increased contribution from&#13;
MOC (Y 100 million); and (g) domestic loans (Y 170 million).&#13;
2.31  The Province's Master Plan for Poor Areas (8-7 Year Plan for Poverty Alleviation&#13;
1994-2000) has set as its goal to provide year-round access to every poor township and&#13;
80 percent of the villages in Shaanxi. The transport component of this plan calls for the&#13;
completion of 403 road projects (totaling 8,918 km), of which 4,858 km are to be&#13;
rehabilitated, 1,670 km to be newly constructed on Class IV roads, 2,024 km to be&#13;
upgraded from unclassified status to all-weather roads, and 366 km to be upgraded from&#13;
Class IV to Class III. The total cost of these improvements is about Y 1.5 billion ($175&#13;
million) or about 15 percent of the Province's 9FYP highway sector investment.&#13;
2.32  The proposed highway developments are ambitious, and there is a danger that&#13;
maintenance could be sacrificed for new construction. As a percentage of total highway&#13;
expenditures in Shaanxi, maintenance has decreased from about 18.0 percent in the 7FYP&#13;
to 13.0 percent in the 8FYP and is expected to be 9.4 percent in the 9FYP, largely as a&#13;
result of large increases in construction expenditures. SPTD is, however, aware of these&#13;
trends and plans to improve highway investment planning and prioritization. Also, it is&#13;
considering ways of allocating a greater share of financial resources to maintenance. The&#13;
institutional strengthening/ training contained in the proposed project (paras. 3.32-3.33),&#13;
the provision of maintenance equipment (para. 3.24) as well as the study of highway&#13;
maintenance should help improve investment planning and highway maintenance and&#13;
increase SPTD's institutional capacity to implement its future development and&#13;
maintenance programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT FORMULATION AND PREPARATION&#13;
3.1   The support of highway development in Shaanxi is particularly important in light&#13;
of the province's national strategic transport location, in addition to its own infrastructure&#13;
development requirements. One of its key transport corridors is the east-west Tongguan&#13;
(Henan Border)-Xian-Baoji (Gansu Border) route. This route is a part of one of the two&#13;
east-west high-priority corridors in the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS). The&#13;
Bank's strategy for highway lending has supported the development of this NTHS. The&#13;
Weinan-Tongguan Expressway (WTE), which is one component of the proposed Second&#13;
Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project constitutes an important link of the above-mentioned&#13;
east-west corridor of the NTHS. Under the proposed Second Henan Highway Project,&#13;
which was appraised in November 1995, the 136 km section between Luoyang and&#13;
Sanmenxia would be undertaken. Under the proposed Second Xinjiang Highway Project,&#13;
which is now being prepared, the 262 km section between Urumqi and Kuitun would be&#13;
constructed.&#13;
3.2   The proposed project was prepared under the directives of the Shaanxi Provincial&#13;
Transport Department (SPTD), with the guidance of SPC, MOF, MOC and the People's&#13;
Bank of China. The feasibility studies for the major highways contained in the project&#13;
were prepared by SPHSDI. Following the identification mission in October 1994 and the&#13;
preparation mission in April 1995, the project was appraised in July 1995.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.3   The proposed project has the following objectives:&#13;
(a)   support continuing development of road infrastructure to relieve&#13;
congestion, improve access to important archeological and tourist sites,&#13;
facilitate mobility and increase the efficiency of road transport in the&#13;
interest of stimulating economic activity by supporting a slice of the&#13;
Shaanxi highway investment program (including national, provincial,&#13;
county, and village roads) during the 9FYP;&#13;
(b)   assist in the implementation of policies to alleviate poverty in the poor&#13;
areas of the province;&#13;
(c)   promote development of institutional capabilities of SPTD, through&#13;
training and other means, in planning, design, operations and maintenance&#13;
of Shaanxi's highway network; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
(d)   increase the safety of road transport.&#13;
3.4   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for China, presented to the Board in June 1995, supports China's strategy to&#13;
reduce poverty and to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks by, inter alia, rapidly modernizing&#13;
and expanding its highway system. The proposed project furthers both of these goals by&#13;
reducing poverty in Shaanxi through a program of rural highway improvements targeted&#13;
at the poor counties and implementing the Weinan-Tongguan Expressway segment of the&#13;
NTHS.   Furthermore, Bank assistance to NTHS construction should facilitate&#13;
interprovincial trade and promote long-distance and transit road traffic, which in turn&#13;
would help arrest a growing regionalism while furthering the liberalization, facilitation&#13;
and cost reduction of transport, key requirements for market-oriented reforms to succeed.&#13;
Bank support is also justified by project assistance to institutional development, which&#13;
among other things would include a study of the various options to provide an east-west&#13;
bypass around Xian (which is a part of the east-west corridor of the NTHS) and a&#13;
highway maintenance study to improve the allocation of highway maintenance funds&#13;
among various maintenance activities, introduce the market mechanism in highway&#13;
maintenance, and improve methods of highway maintenance through introduction of a&#13;
higher degree of mechanization. Bank involvement is also expected to benefit the design&#13;
and the quality of construction of works to be constructed (this has been problematic in&#13;
some other projects) as well as the traffic safety on roads. The project would also foster&#13;
improved practices in the areas of environment and land acquisition and resettlement of&#13;
affected people.&#13;
C. PROJECT SCOPE&#13;
3.5   The scope of the project includes:&#13;
(a)   Construction of five high-grade highways (Map IBRD 27048) comprising:&#13;
(i)    a 78.1 km four-lane expressway between Weinan and Tongguan&#13;
(Henan Border);&#13;
(ii)    a 73.6 km four-lane Class I highway between Tongchuan and&#13;
Huangling and doubling of the existing two-lane Class I highway&#13;
between Yaoxian and Tongchuan (18.4 km);&#13;
(iii)    a 48.3 km two-lane Class II auto-only highway between Lantian&#13;
and Xiaoshangyuan;&#13;
(iv)    a 5.9 km two-lane Class II auto-only highway connecting Lintong&#13;
and the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum;&#13;
(v)   an 34.8 km two-lane Class II auto-only highway between Famen&#13;
Buddhist Temple and Jiangzhuang; and between Jiangzhuang and&#13;
Tangyu.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
(b)   upgrading of the 32 km Xian-Sanyuan Class I highway by providing full&#13;
control of access, traffic safety devices, and installation of a&#13;
telecommunication system;&#13;
(c)   construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of three linking roads with a&#13;
total length of about 8.2 km that would interconnect and feed traffic to the&#13;
proposed high-grade highways at interchanges;&#13;
(d)   improvement and new construction of about 4,100 km of rural roads in a&#13;
program to help alleviate poverty (RIPA) in poor counties in Shaanxi;&#13;
(e)   provision of equipment for:&#13;
(i)   control of construction quality and for monitoring of the&#13;
environment during the construction of the high-grade highways&#13;
and their linking roads;&#13;
(ii)   operation and maintenance of the high-grade highways;&#13;
(iii)    maintenance of the Shaanxi provincial highway network (other&#13;
than the high-grade highways); and&#13;
(iv)   institutional strengthening of the SPTD and related institutions and&#13;
the traffic police;&#13;
(f)   a road safety component to help reduce accidents on Shaanxi's highways;&#13;
and&#13;
(g)   institutional strengthening and training (IST) of the staff of SPTD and its&#13;
related agencies and institutes by enhancing capabilities in high-grade&#13;
highway construction supervision and operations; highway investment&#13;
planning, including the carrying out of the study of alternative locations of&#13;
the Xian east-west bypass; maintenance of high-grade highways and other&#13;
roads, including a study of highway maintenance; and implementation of&#13;
RIPA and highway traffic safety components of the project.&#13;
(a)   Construction of High-Grade Highways&#13;
3.6   The basic design characteristics of the five proposed high-grade highways, as well&#13;
as the status of the design and bid documents for these highways, are shown in Table 3.1.&#13;
These high-grade highways would be operated as toll highways. This would entail:&#13;
(a) supply and installation of electrical, electronic and mechanical equipment for toll&#13;
collection, telecommunications and lighting facilities. However, the equipment to be&#13;
provided to each highway would vary depending on the class of highway and the&#13;
projected traffic volume, and; (b) construction of management and maintenance&#13;
buildings, parking areas and service areas;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
3.7   Weinan-Tongguan Expressway (WTE). The proposed WTE would serve one&#13;
of the most heavily developed corridors in Shaanxi Province and form part of one of the&#13;
12 NTHS corridors in China selected by MOC for expressway development and as the&#13;
eastem gateway to Xian and would parallel National Highway No. 312.&#13;
3.8   The existing road between Weinan and Tongguan (National Highway 312) is a&#13;
Class III road, with no separation of motorized and slow-moving traffic and presently&#13;
carries about 5,000 mte per day and cannot accommodate projected traffic beyond 2000.&#13;
Widening of the existing road would not be feasible because of extensive side&#13;
development in several townships and the poor construction of the existing pavement and&#13;
drainage structures.&#13;
3.9   The eastemmost 20 km would not achieve their full economic benefits unless the&#13;
WTE were to be connected to the existing National Highway 310. This would be&#13;
accomplished through construction of a 6.1 km Connecting Road between Yangjia and&#13;
Baijiazhai, completely in Henan Province. Shaanxi and Henan Provinces have agreed&#13;
that construction of this connection would be completed at about the same time as the&#13;
WTE. This Connection has been included in the proposed Second Henan Highway&#13;
Project (to be financed by the Bank) and to be presented to the Board in June 1996.&#13;
Assurances were obtained from MOF at negotiations that the Connecting Road will be&#13;
open by December 31, 1999, the time that construction of the Weinan-Tongguan&#13;
Expressway is expected to be completed&#13;
3.10  Tongchuan-Huangling Highway (THH). In addition to a four-lane Class I&#13;
highway between Tongchuan and Huangling, the proposed THH would include doubling&#13;
of the existing half Class I highway between Yaoxian and Tongchuan, completed under&#13;
the Bank-financed Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project (Loan 2952-CHA). Also, since&#13;
the existing road from Xian to Sanyuan (also completed under the Bank-financed Shaanxi&#13;
Provincial Highway Project) is a Class I highway without access control, SPTD agreed to&#13;
upgrade this highway to a four-lane highway with full control of access by the year 1997,&#13;
to be compatible with the THH. This upgrading is included as a component of the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
3.11  The THH would serve as the northern gateway to Xian and provide access to the&#13;
coal mining base of Tongchuan, and the energy resource base of Huangling county.&#13;
Also, it would serve the important touristic attraction of the Yellow Emperor in&#13;
Huangling. Construction of the THH would constitute a main step in Shaanxi's effort to&#13;
better serve the northern part of the province a region that contains many of the poor in&#13;
Shaanxi.&#13;
3.12 Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Highway (LXH). The proposed LXH two-lane Class&#13;
II auto-only highway would provide service to the poor Shangluo prefecture and improve&#13;
the access from the south to Xian..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.13 Lintong-Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Highway (LTWMH). The proposed&#13;
two-lane Class II auto-only highway would form a branch from the Xian-Lintong&#13;
Expressway to serve the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum.&#13;
3.14  Famen Buddhist Temple-Jiangzhuang-Tangyu Highway (FJTH).  This&#13;
highway would provide access to both the Buddhist temple at Farnensi, the National&#13;
Taibaishan Forest Park and the Tangyu Hot Springs.&#13;
(b)   Upgrading Xian-Sanyuan Class I Highway.&#13;
3.15  Initially, this highway was constructed without access control and many accidents&#13;
are taking place. It carries a high traffic volume (about 10,000 mte per day). With the&#13;
construction of the THH, the Xian-Sanyuan Highway would be the only section between&#13;
Xian and Huangling without access control, although it carries the highest traffic volume.&#13;
The proposed works consist of: (a) construction of about 42.9 km of service roads;&#13;
(b) construction of 13 overpasses for tractors and bicycles, 5 overpasses for pedestrians, 2&#13;
underpasses for vehicles, 4 overpasses for vehicles and 3 interchanges; (c) provision of&#13;
safety facilities comprising 122 traffic signs, 55.6 km of fence, 43.6 km of guard rail,&#13;
5.4 km of concrete guard rails, and about 25,700 m2 of pavement markings; (d) planting&#13;
of grass and shrubs; and (e) installation of 86.2 km of communication cables and 174&#13;
emergency telephones. Because of the urgency of these improvements, work on them is&#13;
expected to start in May 1996 and be completed by June 1997.&#13;
(e)   Linking Roads.&#13;
3.16  The opening of the high-grade highways would bring a significant increase in&#13;
traffic to the roads connecting them to the cities along the existing roads and to other&#13;
transversal provincial roads. Without the proper linking to the cities and towns from&#13;
interchanges, these high-grade highways would not be effectively used. Based on a&#13;
comprehensive review of these linking roads, SPTD selected three roads with a total&#13;
length of 8.2 km for new construction and improvement (Table 3.2). Due to the short&#13;
length of these roads, they are included within the designs of the related sections of the&#13;
high-grade highways. In addition, four other roads with a total length of 21 km would be&#13;
constructed or improved by 1999. But, these will be implemented by SPTD in&#13;
cooperation with the local towns/counties using their own funds. SPTD assured the Bank&#13;
that these improvements will be implemented and completed on time. Moreover, 1 km&#13;
on both sides of the linking roads at each interchange would be improved under the high-&#13;
grade highway component, if the existing road condition cannot meet the required&#13;
standards.&#13;
Supervision of Construction of the High-Grade Highways and Linking Roads&#13;
3.17  Based on the experience gained from completed and ongoing Bank-financed&#13;
highway projects in Shaanxi and other provinces, a combined team of local engineers,&#13;
technicians and other personnel and foreign consultants would be set up to supervise the&#13;
construction of the high-grade highways and linking roads.  The organizational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
arrangements and terms of reference for the construction supervision of these highways&#13;
have been drawn up by SPTD and were found to be adequate (Chart 5). The team would&#13;
consist of about 314 local staff and 8 international experts. The total input by the&#13;
international staff is estimated at about 196 person-months including 4 person-months to&#13;
train 311 local supervision staff for one month in China, as well as 30 local staff for one&#13;
month (30 person-months) abroad. The international supervising engineers would be&#13;
integrated into the organization with operational responsibilities.  Furthermore, the&#13;
international consultants would help establish procedures at all levels of the supervisory&#13;
work, including on-site inspections and laboratory testing, and train local staff both&#13;
through formal training sessions and on-the-job. The international experts would be&#13;
retained until completion of the construction of the major highways.&#13;
(d)   Improvement and new road construction for Poverty Alleviation (RIPA)&#13;
3.18  Poverty in Shaanxi Province. Shaanxi Province has a population of 34.4&#13;
million, with 10 prefectures and 107 counties. Fifty of these counties, with a combined&#13;
population of 5.0 million (6.3 percent of China's total poor population), have an annual&#13;
per capita income of less than Y 500 and are classified as poor counties. Shaanxi has the&#13;
second largest number of poor counties in China and is the Province with the fifth largest&#13;
poor population. The Province's Master Plan for Poverty Alleviation (1994-2000) has set&#13;
its goal for every poor county township and 80 percent of the villages in Shaanxi to have&#13;
all-weather access to a main provincial road axis.&#13;
3.19 Road Transport in Poverty Areas. Currently, six of the Province's townships&#13;
and some 11,000 administrative villages do not have all-weather access to highways.&#13;
Due to financial shortfalls, there is also a shortage of needed bridges and culverts and this&#13;
contributes to a further deterioration in the existing road network from poor drainage and&#13;
water erosion. Additionally, 191 roads have serious traffic congestion and 46 roads (a&#13;
total of 738 km) are not linked to the rest of the Province's rural road network. SPTD, in&#13;
cooperation with the Shaanxi Provincial Planning Committee (SPPC), Shaanxi Poverty&#13;
Alleviation Office (SPAO) and the Leading Group for Transportation for Poverty&#13;
Alleviation (LGTPA), has developed a program of Roads Improvement for Poverty&#13;
Alleviation (RIPA) to rehabilitate, upgrade and construct road systems in the province's&#13;
50 poor counties in order to provide the rural poor better access to the main provincial&#13;
highways.&#13;
3.20 RIPA Component. The component will finance some of the road improvement&#13;
projects that meet agreed economic and social criteria, under procedures similar to the&#13;
Roads Improvement Program (RIP) components in other provincial projects in China&#13;
(Zhejiang, Henan, and Guangdong). Priority will be given to rural road segments that,&#13;
through related road systems, are clearly linked to: (a) current (or planned) productive&#13;
and economically viable development projects; and (b) investments enabling productive,&#13;
though landlocked, populations to have easier access to education, health and other social&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
3.21   Selection of RIPA Packages. The criteria, screening and selection process to be&#13;
used were agreed with SPTD, and are detailed in Annex 1. As a result, a RIPA program&#13;
consisting of 31 highway systems in 25 poor counties and with a total length of about&#13;
4,068 km was agreed with SPTD. On the basis of initial analysis of aggregate data for&#13;
poor counties and road systems, and of the cost effectiveness of road systems under the&#13;
RIPA program, SPTD selected a first batch of RIPA systems for further technical,&#13;
economic and social feasibility analyses. The first batch covers five systems with a total&#13;
length of about 320 km in three prefectures (Yulin, Shangluo and Ankang).&#13;
3.22   Processing of RIPA Packages. The road systems to be financed under this&#13;
component will be drawn from the pool of RIPA systems mentioned above (para. 3.21)&#13;
and their submission for approval to the Bank will be effected in manageable batches of&#13;
projects. The documentation developed as part of the Bank approval process will&#13;
constitute a Project File including: (a) an Economic and Social Benefit Analysis (as&#13;
detailed in Annex 1) including evidence that each of the proposed systems meets the&#13;
agreed EIRR criteria; (b) a Technical Analysis, including proposed works, alternative&#13;
engineering designs and estimated costs; (c) an Environmental Action Plan for each&#13;
system, and an Environmental Impact Assessment for subprojects that involve new road&#13;
construction or substantial widening/land acquisition (para. 3.35); and (d) a Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan for each system (where at least 200 people are affected by land acquisition&#13;
and/or resettlement). For systems affecting less than 200 persons, specific information&#13;
related to impacts, cost estimates and the implementation schedule should be provided&#13;
(para. 3.44).&#13;
3.23   Supervision and Maintenance of RIPA. Each batch submitted for approval will&#13;
also include an Implementation and Supervision Plan, covering the implementation&#13;
process,4 supervision5 and monitoring of works, both for each system as well as for the&#13;
prefecture and county agency responsible for each system. SPTD will also submit a&#13;
Maintenance Plan describing who (township, county or prefecture) will maintain the&#13;
system after completion, the organizational structure for maintenance of the RIPA&#13;
system, the equipment and personnel needed to implement each maintenance plan and the&#13;
training needs anticipated under this plan over the implementation period.&#13;
4 The process involves the preparation of design and bid documents, invitation of bids, bid evaluation,&#13;
selection of the contractors, signing of contracts, mobilization by contractors and time to physically&#13;
implement the works.&#13;
5 A RIPA supervision plan will show the construction supervision tasks to be undertaken, organizational&#13;
structure for construction supervision, staffing requirements, training of the supervision staff if&#13;
necessary, office space, transport and communication requirements, laboratory requirements, and&#13;
surveying equipment as well as the estimated cost of supervision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
(e)   Equipment&#13;
3.24  The equipment to be provided under the project has been identified by SPTD and&#13;
reviewed by the Bank. The agreed lists of equipment, together with their estimated costs,&#13;
are available in the project files. These lists include equipment required for operation and&#13;
maintenance of the high-grade highways, construction quality control and highway&#13;
research, environmental monitoring, maintenance of the existing highway network&#13;
including RIPA roads, institutional strengthening of selected institutions, and equipment&#13;
for highway safety. The preliminary total equipment cost is estimated at about Y 132&#13;
million ($16.0 million), of which $8.3 million would be in foreign currencies. The Bank&#13;
and SPTD agreed that the equipment lists should be looked at as subject to reasonable&#13;
change with regard to type and number, and consequently, some flexibility should be&#13;
exercised during project implementation to properly allow for changing circumstances&#13;
and needs.&#13;
3.25  Equipment for High-Grade Highways. To set up and efficiently operate the&#13;
central laboratory in Xian and the regional laboratories in Huaxian, Jinsuoguan,&#13;
Jiangzhuang and Lantian in support of the construction supervision activities, there is a&#13;
need for equipment and instruments, particularly for soils and asphalt concrete testing. In&#13;
the course of drawing up the Environmental Action Plans (EAPs), the equipment and&#13;
instruments required to implement the environmental protection measures have been&#13;
identified. For the operation and maintenance of the high-grade highways, equipment&#13;
requirements have also been identified.&#13;
3.26  Equipment for Maintenance of Roads. This equipment consists of urgently&#13;
required equipment for routine, periodic maintenance and heavy repair of roads to&#13;
replenish the equipment fleet of the provincial and county maintenance units. This&#13;
equipment would be used for maintenance of the existing highway network including&#13;
RIPA roads.&#13;
3.27  Equipment for Institutional Strengthening.  These consist of specialized&#13;
equipment for support of the institutions and training schools affiliated with SPTD that&#13;
would be strengthened under the proposed project (para. 3.33), as well as equipment for&#13;
traffic safety.  The latter consist of equipment required for enforcement of speed&#13;
regulations, as well as a computer and related software for treatment of accident data.&#13;
Highway Maintenance&#13;
3.28  Highways in Shaanxi are generally well maintained.  In 1995, only 30 km&#13;
(0.3 percent) of the 8,942 km of trunk highways (national and provincial) were in poor&#13;
condition, 30.5 percent in excellent condition, 58.0 percent in good condition and&#13;
11.2 percent in average condition. The corresponding conditions for the prefectural roads&#13;
(12,445 km) in 1994 were as follows:  3.6 percent excellent, 68.2 percent good,&#13;
26.7 percent acceptable and 1.5 percent bad. The conditions for the remaining roads&#13;
(about 17,600 km) are not known at this time, but it is generally believed that they are in&#13;
worse condition than the other roads. SPTD intends to reduce the percentage of roads in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
acceptable and bad conditions. To this effect, assurances were obtained at negotiations&#13;
from SPTD that it would, by April 30 of each year commencing in 1997 and ending in&#13;
2003, furnish an annual highway maintenance report for the Bank's review and&#13;
comments, which would: (a) show the length of each class of road by condition&#13;
(excellent, good, fair and bad), (b) establish targets for the following year, including an&#13;
estimate of the required physical works (routine maintenance, periodic maintenance,&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading) and the cost thereof, and; (c) measure the results and the&#13;
actual expenditures against the targets and the budgetedfunds thereof&#13;
3.29  SPTD would carry out a highway maintenance study consisting of four parts: the&#13;
first focused on organizational structure and the introduction of market mechanisms in&#13;
highway maintenance; the second on improving maintenance methods and techniques,&#13;
with emphasis on more mechanization; the third on improved methods of collecting and&#13;
analyzing traffic volume data, and; the fourth on the development of a provincial Road&#13;
Data Bank system. Annex 3 summarizes the TOR for the proposed study, which will be&#13;
undertaken by a team of local specialists assisted by international experts. The results of&#13;
the study would benefit MOC and all provincial Communication/Transport Departments&#13;
in China. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that SPTD shall. (a) by June 30,&#13;
1996, establish a Leading Group to guide the highway maintenance study and to provide&#13;
comments on the results and recommendations thereof; (b) undertake and, by&#13;
September 30, 1998, complete the said study in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank; (c) by December 31, 1998, furnish the said study, together with&#13;
the comments of the said Leading Group, to the Bank for review; and (d) take&#13;
appropriate steps to implement the said study's recommendations, taking into&#13;
consideration the comments thereon of the Bank and the said Leading Group.&#13;
(f)   Road Safety Program&#13;
3.30  During 1990-94, an average of 8,000 traffic accidents per year occurred on&#13;
Shaanxi's highways, resulting in 1,530 fatalities and 4,500 injuries. Annex 4 summarizes&#13;
the existing road safety situation in Shaanxi and related problems and presents an&#13;
implementable road safety program, which was confirmed with SPTD and the Traffic&#13;
Police for inclusion it in the proposed project.&#13;
3.31  The design of the high-grade highways included in the project as well as their&#13;
linking roads was reviewed from a safety point of view by the Italian design review&#13;
consultants and Danish and Norwegian safety experts. Consequently, those designs have&#13;
been prepared to a high standard and reflect safety considerations adequately. The road&#13;
safety program included under the project comprises: (a) establishing a Leading Group&#13;
for Traffic Safety Coordination to coordinate between SPTD and the Traffic Police (the&#13;
main agencies involved in highway safety). It is expected that the Leading Group for&#13;
Road Safety Coordination would be established by the end of February 1996. Its&#13;
establishment would be a condition of project presentation to the Board and its continued&#13;
operation would be confirmed in the annual Project Monitoring Reports; (b) improving&#13;
traffic accident reporting forms, reviewing the geographic location (of accidents) coding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
system, installing a Microcomputer Accident Analysis Package (MAAP); (c) establishing&#13;
a Traffic Safety Unit in SPTD and training its staff to undertake accident black spot&#13;
identification and design and carry out a pilot program of black spot improvements and&#13;
establish safety and audit procedures and checks; (d) undertaking a study to evaluate the&#13;
driver training system, including one month of support by an international expert (see&#13;
Appendix 1 of Annex 4 for terms of reference); (e) provision of equipment to support the&#13;
above-mentioned activities, and; (f) evaluation of the implementation of the Shaanxi&#13;
Road Safety Program by an independent local expert (I person-month). SPTD agreed to&#13;
provide a special budget of Y 10 million ($1.20 million) over four years to cover the cost&#13;
of the accident black spot pilot program and traffic safety studies under (d) and (f) above.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Shaanxi would maintain: (a) a Leading&#13;
Group with representatives from SPTD and the Traffic police, for traffic safety&#13;
coordination, policy-making and planning, with functions and responsibilities acceptable&#13;
to the Bank, and (b) a Traffic Safety Unit within SPTD, with functions and&#13;
responsibilities acceptable to the Bank, to serve as the Secretariat for the said Leading&#13;
Group and to carry out a pilot black spot improvement program under terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to the Bank Also, agreement was reached during negotiations that SPTD&#13;
would, pursuant to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank: (a) by December 31, 2000,&#13;
complete a black spot identification and improvement program; (b) by December 31,&#13;
2001, have an expert acceptable to the Bank prepare an evaluatio of its Road Safety&#13;
Program according to indicators acceptable to the Bank&#13;
(g)   Institutional Strengthening and Training&#13;
3.32  The purpose of the Institutional Strengthening and Training (IST) component is&#13;
to strengthen the SPTD capabilities in the following priority areas: (a) High-Grade&#13;
Highway construction supervision and operations; (b) Project Implementation&#13;
Management; (c) Highway Planning; and (d) maintenance of High-Grade Highways and&#13;
Other Roads. It will also strengthen SPTD's capabilities in new areas of investment,&#13;
specifically in: (e) studying the feasibility and preferred location of the Xian east-west&#13;
bypass; (f) Roads Improvement for Poverty Alleviation and (g) Road Safety. The total&#13;
cost of the Institutional Strengthening and Training component is estimated at Y 45.10&#13;
million, of which $3.10 million are in foreign currencies (Table 3.3).&#13;
3.33  The IST Component will consist of three elements:&#13;
(a)   Intensive Strengthening (IS) of research and training organizations&#13;
through the development of staff capabilities to deliver training in new&#13;
areas and in bolstering their hardware and equipment for new functional&#13;
capacity. This element would include activities in the following institutes&#13;
and centers&#13;
(i)   the Provincial Traffic School (PTS) (Chart 7) and the Provincial&#13;
Traffic Technical School (PTTS) (Chart 8), which are both under&#13;
the supervision of SPTD's Education Division, strengthening of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
staff capabilities and program offerings in traffic engineering and&#13;
in high-grade highway maintenance programs;&#13;
(ii)   the in-service Vocational School (VS) (Chart 8) and the SPTD's&#13;
short-term management in-service Staff Training Center (STC );&#13;
(iii)   the Highway Research Institute (HRI) (Chart 9) and at the Shaanxi&#13;
Provincial Highway Survey and Design Institute.(SPHSDI);&#13;
(iv)    other institutions of SPTD such as the Provincial Information&#13;
Center.&#13;
(b)   Training for SPTD and project personnel within Shaanxi (2,975 trainees&#13;
for 2,490 person-months of training), in other Chinese provincial training&#13;
institutes and schools (80 person-months) and abroad (63 person-months).&#13;
The total level of training under the project involves 3,278 persons for a&#13;
total of 2,898.6 person-months at an estimated cost of Y 10.13 million&#13;
($1.22 million), of which $0.91 million in foreign currencies. This&#13;
estimate includes projected training in the areas of environmental&#13;
monitoring and supervision (Annex 5), and construction supervision (see&#13;
para 3.17). Table 3.4 presents a short description of each training activity,&#13;
both in China and abroad, number of trainees and the total person-months.&#13;
(c)   Strengthening New Functional areas. This element would consist of:&#13;
(i)    Study of Xian Bypass. The Xian Bypass constitutes a part of the&#13;
east-west NTHS corridor passing through Xian. The study would&#13;
investigate the various reasonable alternative locations, compare&#13;
them from traffic service, economic and financial, environmental,&#13;
archeological and resettlement aspects; select the best alternative&#13;
and determine its economic and financial viability as well as the&#13;
interim improvements until the bypass is implemented. Annex 2&#13;
includes the terms of reference (TOR) for the proposed study. The&#13;
study will be conducted by a team of local experts supported by&#13;
nationally  renowned  traffic,  city  planning,  economic,&#13;
environmental and archeological experts, as well as three&#13;
international experts in the areas of urban planning and transport&#13;
development, traffic engineering and highway design, and&#13;
archeology, resettlement and environment.  Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that SPTD shall (1) maintain a review&#13;
panel comprising representatives of the concerned provincial&#13;
agencies and the central government to guide the study of the Xian&#13;
east-west bypass and provide comments on the results and&#13;
recommendations thereof; (2) undertake and, by June 30, 1997,&#13;
complete tne said study in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank; (3) by August 31, 1997, furnish the study&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
to the panel and the Bank for review; and (4) take appropriate&#13;
steps to implement the recommendations of the said study, taking&#13;
into account the comments thereon of the said review panel and the&#13;
Bank&#13;
(ii)    Road Maintenance Studies will be carried out as part of the IS&#13;
component.  The various parts will focus on improving the&#13;
organization of highway maintenance, the allocation of funds&#13;
among different maintenance activities, methods of maintenance,&#13;
the monitoring of maintenance and the use of an RDB/PMS system&#13;
to make these more useful as tools of highway investment planning&#13;
(para. 3.28);&#13;
(iii)   Support of the Roads Improvement for Poverty Alleviation&#13;
(RIPA) component through two main avenues: (1) strengthening&#13;
of the capacity of the Unit in SPTD's Highway Administration&#13;
Bureau dealing with Poverty Alleviation; and (2) provision of&#13;
training, particularly in Road Maintenance (both management and&#13;
technical aspects) to county- and township-level personnel.&#13;
(iv)    Support to the Road Safety component through provision of&#13;
training and hardware for staff in the SPTD's Traffic Safety Unit.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.34 Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) have been carried out for all the major&#13;
highways and link roads included in the proposed project. Environmental Action Plans&#13;
(EAPs) have been prepared, incorporating Bank comments on earlier drafts, and found&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, as were the EIAs. However, as the documents for the Xian-&#13;
Sanyuan Highway have only recently been received and are currently being reviewed, the&#13;
submittal of an acceptable environmental assessment and action plan for this highway&#13;
wouild be a condition of negotiation.&#13;
3.35  For the RIPA component of the proposed project, it was agreed that a Sectoral&#13;
Environmental Assessment approach would be applied. All RIPA subprojects will be&#13;
classified into two categories. Category I subprojects are those with no new road&#13;
construction nor substantial widening/land acquisition, etc. Since no major adverse&#13;
impacts are anticipated, only EAPs will be prepared for this category of subprojects.&#13;
Category II subprojects are those with new road construction or substantial widening/land&#13;
acquisition, etc. For these, both EIAs and EAPs will be prepared. EIA reports and EAPs&#13;
for the first-year package of subprojects were prepared and submitted to the Bank in May&#13;
1995. Only one of these systems was classified as Category II subproject. All project&#13;
EIPs and EIAs are satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.36  Major enviromnental impacts include noise and air pollution during the&#13;
construction and operation phases (particularly Weinan-Tongguan Expressway,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Highway and Xian-Sanyuan Class I Highway), alteration&#13;
of hydrological regimes, soil erosion and impacts on local ecology during the&#13;
construction (all projects but particularly Tongchuan-Huangling Highway and Lantian-&#13;
Xiaoshangyuan Highway), impacts on cultural relics (particularly Tongchuan-Huangling&#13;
Highway and Weinan-Tongguan Expressway), and transportation of construction&#13;
materials (all projects).&#13;
3.37  The EAPs specified the appropriate mitigation measures, enviromnental&#13;
monitoring plans, institutional arrangements to implement the EAPs, training and&#13;
equipment requirements, and the budget needed for environmental protection. Major&#13;
mitigation measures include adequate selection of alignment, appropriate design of&#13;
culverts and overpasses/underpasses to minimize social disruption, reconstruction of&#13;
irrigation channels where appropriate, water sprinkling to prevent dust during the&#13;
construction, construction of noise barriers and forest belts, installation of double-glass&#13;
windows, etc., to minimize noise and air pollution during the operation phase. The&#13;
engineering design and technical specifications for the highways will incorporate&#13;
appropriate measures required to be taken for environmental protection.  It was&#13;
ascertained that the proposed highways would not affect ecologically sensitive areas and&#13;
that their construction and operation should have no adverse impact on the environment&#13;
through the implementation of EAPs. The summary of the EIAs and EAPs are presented&#13;
in Annex 5 and copies of the EIAs and EAPs are available in the Project File and the&#13;
Public Information Center. Assurance were obtained at negotiations from SPTD that:&#13;
(a) the environmental protection measures stipulated in the EAPs and preparation of&#13;
EAPs for RIPA systems for subsequent years would be carried out in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) SPTD would furnish to the Bank an annual&#13;
environmental monitoring report for the high-grade highways during the construction&#13;
phase andfor each of the first three years following completion of construction..&#13;
E. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
3.38  In compliance with Chinese laws and regulations, which generally conform to the&#13;
Bank's policies on involuntary resettlement, SPTD prepared the resettlement action plans&#13;
(RAPs) for all project high-grade highways (including the respective linking roads), and&#13;
the first year package of the RIPA component. As the RAP for the Xian-Sanyuan&#13;
Highway has only recently been received in the Bank and is still being reviewed, the&#13;
submittal of a RAP acceptable to the Bank for this highway would be a condition of&#13;
negotiations. These RAPs form the basis for implementation of resettlement and land&#13;
acquisition in the proposed project. The main objective of the resettlement program is to&#13;
ensure that all categories of affected persons are able to at least restore, if not improve,&#13;
their standard of living after resettlement. Also, every effort is exerted to minimize&#13;
acquisition of productive farmland and residential areas and enterprises in order to reduce&#13;
adverse project impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
High-Grade Highways&#13;
3.39 Approximately 14,213 mu of land (948 ha) affecting 13,097 persons will need to&#13;
be acquired and 548 houses (2,477 persons) and 34 enterprises (employing 2,156&#13;
workers) will be affected by the high-grade highways. About 3,734 mu (249 ha) will also&#13;
need to be leased temporarily during construction. The total number of persons affected&#13;
is 17,730. Most of those affected by the loss of land will be rehabilitated through&#13;
redistribution of land in their existing villages. However, 1,042 affected people will be&#13;
provided with nonagriculture-based resettlement and their residence registration will be&#13;
changed from "rural" to "urban." As for affected enterprises, 23 (employing 1,736&#13;
people) will need to be relocated. The total number of people relocated will be 2,154&#13;
(467 households). A detailed socioeconomic survey of the affected persons will be&#13;
carried out by the Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences (SASS) before the RAPs are&#13;
implemented. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement for the entire project is&#13;
about $45 million.&#13;
3.40  Information Dissemination, Participation and Consultations. The affected&#13;
people will be informed through newspaper, radio, television, etc. about the project and&#13;
the proposed land acquisition and resettlement program. The Land Acquisition and&#13;
Resettlement (LA&amp;R) institutions will also disseminate information through meetings,&#13;
documents and notices. The affected persons will be informed about the compensation&#13;
standards, the LA&amp;R institutions at the various levels, the arrangements for provision of&#13;
nonagricultural jobs, the provisions for redressal of grievances and the proposed&#13;
arrangements for internal and external monitoring of the LA&amp;R program. This will be&#13;
done by distributing a Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB) to each affected&#13;
household. The RIB will be distributed to the affected households two months after&#13;
completion of project negotiations.&#13;
3.41  Implementation. Implementation of the RAPs (except for Tongchuan-Huangling&#13;
Highway) was initiated in October 1995 and will be completed by the end of September&#13;
1996, i.e., at least one month before the proposed start of construction.  The&#13;
implementation of the Tongchuan-Huangling RAP will start in August 1996 and will be&#13;
completed in May 1997. The resettlement process will be administered by the respective&#13;
local governments at city/county, township and village levels in accordance with the&#13;
terms of agreement between SPTD and the local governments involved, which will be&#13;
based on the provisions of the RAPs. A leading group will be set up for each high-grade&#13;
highway for coordination with local governments in accordance with the provisions of the&#13;
RAPs. A summary of the RAPs for the high-grade highways and linking roads is&#13;
presented in Annex 6. A copy of the RAPs will be deposited in the Public Information&#13;
Center. Assurances were obtained at negotiations from SPG that all LA&amp;R activities&#13;
with respect to the high-grade highways and linking roads as well as the RIPA&#13;
subprojects would be completed according to the RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
3.42  Grievance Redressal and Appeals Process. If any affected person is dissatisfied&#13;
with any aspect of LA&amp;R, they can lodge a complaint wit the respective county-level&#13;
LA&amp;R office or directly to the LA&amp;R monitoring office under the LARLG. If the issue&#13;
is not resolved within three weeks, a written grievance can be submitted to the LARLG.&#13;
The LARLG should resolve the issue within four weeks. If the affected person is not&#13;
satisfied by the decision of the LARLG, he/she can lodge a written appeal to the county-&#13;
level people's court. In case the decision of the county-level court fails to satisfy the&#13;
affected person, a second appeal can be lodged in the court of the city/prefecture. The&#13;
decision of this court will be final and binding. These arrangements are considered&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
3.43 Monitoring and Evaluation. Implementation of the RAPs would be internally&#13;
and externally monitored for physical progress, disbursements and audits and&#13;
socioeconomic impacts.&#13;
(a)   Internal Monitoring. The internal monitoring, to be carried out by the&#13;
provincial government, will monitor the implementation of the RAPs. A&#13;
summary of internal monitoring will be submitted every six months to the&#13;
Bank.  The first internal monitoring report will be submitted by&#13;
September 30, 1996.&#13;
(b)   External Monitoring.  The task of external monitoring of RAPs'&#13;
implementation by an independent agency has been entrusted by SPTD to&#13;
SASS. Apart from physical monitoring of the LA&amp;R program, which will&#13;
also be carried out by the internal monitoring agencies, SASS will&#13;
concentrate on evaluation of the implementation of the RAPs. External&#13;
monitoring will start along with the initiation of LA&amp;R activities and will&#13;
continue one year beyond project completion (until 2001). Monitoring&#13;
reports will be prepared every six months and submitted to the project&#13;
head office and to the Bank. The first external monitoring report will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank by December 31, 1996. A final monitoring and&#13;
evaluation report will also be prepared after project completion (based on&#13;
"follow-up" socioeconomic survey of the affected persons) and submitted&#13;
to the Bank by December 31, 2001.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the monitoring of the socioeconomic&#13;
impact of the resettlement process for the high-grade highways and linking roads as well&#13;
as for the Xian-Sanyuan Highway and the RIPA roads would be carried out against the&#13;
RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. Implementation of the RAPs would also be&#13;
monitored through the routine project supervision and project quarterly progress reports&#13;
(paras. 3.74-3.76).&#13;
RIPA&#13;
3.44  The RAPs for the first year's package of the RIPA component have been prepared&#13;
by SPTD and found to be satisfactory by the Bank. Separate RAPs will be prepared for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
each system under the RIPA component where 200 or more persons are affected by land&#13;
acquisition and/or resettlement. For systems affecting less than 200 persons, specific&#13;
information related to project impacts, cost estimates and the implementation schedule&#13;
will be prepared. Approval of the RAPs for the RIPA component will be a condition of&#13;
disbursement for these systems. About 1,248 mu (83.2 ha) of land will be acquired for&#13;
the roads under the RIPA component, constituting the first year's package. About 1,291&#13;
persons will be affected by land acquisition and 355 persons will need to be relocated.&#13;
The compensation and resettlement policies and the implementation framework for land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement under the RIPA component are the same as those for the&#13;
high-grade highways and the linking roads. The external monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
resettlement implementation under the RIPA component will be carried out by SASS on&#13;
the same lines as described for the high-grade highways.&#13;
F. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.45  The total project is estimated to cost about Y 4.62 billion or about $557 million&#13;
equivalent, including land acquisition and physical and price contingencies, as&#13;
summarized in the table on the following page and as detailed in the Project Cost&#13;
Summary (Table 3.5). The foreign exchange cost is estimated at about $213 million, or&#13;
about 38 percent of the total. Base costs are estimated in December 1995 prices.&#13;
Physical contingencies are calculated at 10 percent of the base cost of works and&#13;
construction supervision of the high-grade highways, linking roads and RIPA component.&#13;
Price contingencies have been calculated for foreign costs, using international annual&#13;
escalation factors of 3.3 percent in 1996, 2.3 percent in 1997, and 2.5 percent in each of&#13;
1998, 1999 and 2000. Price contingencies for local costs are based on local annual&#13;
escalation factors of 10.5 percent in 1996, 8.5 percent in 1997, 7.0 percent in 1998,&#13;
6.5 percent in 1999, and 6.2 percent in 2000.&#13;
3.46  The costs of civil works are based on work quantities calculated from preliminary&#13;
or final engineering designs. The costs were computed on the basis of MOC's standard&#13;
manuals for labor and equipment productivity, the related annually updated costs and the&#13;
current market costs of materials. The unit rates were checked against the unit prices&#13;
provided in recent bids for similar highway works executed under Bank financing.&#13;
3.47  The estimated cost of equipment is based on prevailing prices and those quoted by&#13;
manufacturers and suppliers and includes the cost of equipment delivered in Xian, taxes,&#13;
spare parts, and related training if needed to operate and maintain the equipment. The&#13;
estimated cost of consulting services are based on recent contracts for similar services&#13;
under ongoing highway projects.&#13;

G. FINANCING&#13;
3.48   The Bank loan of $210 million would finance about 38 percent of the total project&#13;
cost or 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost. The Central Government (MOC) would&#13;
provide the equivalent of about $144.6 million, while Shaanxi Province would provide&#13;
the equivalent of about $201.9 million to meet the remaining costs of the project,&#13;
including contingencies. MOC's funding would be restricted to the construction of the&#13;
high-grade highways and RIPA. The Bank loan of $210 million would be at the standard&#13;
interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single-currency loans. It would be lent to the&#13;
Ministry of Finance for a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The proceeds&#13;
of the Bank loan would be onlent to Shaanxi Province at the same rate payable to the&#13;
Bank by the Borrower with 0.75 percent per annum commitment fee on the outstanding&#13;
balance, beginning 60 days after loan signing, less any waiver. Agreement was reached&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
with the Borrower at negotiations that it would onlend the proceeds of the loan to the&#13;
SPG on these terms. SPG would bear the foreign exchange risks. The Government of&#13;
China and Shaanxi Province have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single-currency loan&#13;
terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of&#13;
their borrowings by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with that of&#13;
their net trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated. They&#13;
selected the LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full maturity of the loan,&#13;
compared to the fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a 15-year loan. The&#13;
Borrower judges that it can manage any interest rate risk. China is eligible for single-&#13;
currency loans under the expanded program. This loan represents 8.5 percent of the fiscal&#13;
year 1996 IBRD lending program to China, well within the 50 percent volume guideline&#13;
approved by the Bank The details of project financing are shown in the following table.&#13;

H. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.49  Implementing Agencies. The implementation of the project would be the&#13;
responsibility of SPTD. The execution of WTE, THH, FJTH, LTWMH and their linking&#13;
roads would be organized by the Project Execution Office-PEO-in SPTD (Chart 10)&#13;
and SHGHAB. The execution of LXH and RIPA component would be organized by&#13;
PEO and SPHAB. The General Supervision Office under SPTD would be in charge of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
supervision of construction of the project. Concerning the high-grade highways, the&#13;
supervision of construction would be undertaken by a joint international/local supervision&#13;
team. PEO would carry out the implementation of equipment procurement, IST and&#13;
studies on the Xian bypass, road maintenance and road safety. Implementation of the&#13;
road safety component will be the responsibility of SPTD and the Traffic Police in PSB,&#13;
with the Leading Group for Traffic Safety Coordination providing coordination between&#13;
them. The International Tendering Company (ITC) would be retained by SPTD as the&#13;
procurement agency for all aspects of civil works of the project requiring ICB and for&#13;
equipment to be procured from abroad. Upon completion of the high-grade highways, it&#13;
is expected that SHGHAB and SPHAB would be responsible for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of the highways in accordance with their own job scope. Since the high-&#13;
grade highways are segments of the national highway system, MOC would also provide&#13;
general supervision and guidance for execution of the project.&#13;
3.50 High-Grade Highways and Linking Roads. The implementation program for&#13;
high-grade highways is shown in Annex 7. All civil works except for THH would be&#13;
tendered at the same time. THH is expected to be tendered in early 1997. The traffic&#13;
engineering contracts would be tendered about the middle period of the civil works for&#13;
each high-grade highway. The invitation for prequalification of contractors for civil&#13;
works for high-grade highways was issued in November 1995 and the whole&#13;
prequalification process would be finished by March 1996.&#13;
3.51  The detailed designs and draft bidding documents (17 contract sections) were&#13;
completed by the end of December 1995. Acquisition of land and the resettlement&#13;
process are expected to be completed by the end of September 1996. The installation of&#13;
E&amp;M systems for the operation of WTE would be scheduled to commence around March&#13;
1999 and be completed by June 2000. The construction of service facilities along the&#13;
high-grade highways would be a continuous process during the implementation period.&#13;
The high-grade highways are expected to be completed by December 2000.&#13;
3.52 Supervision of Construction of the High-Grade Highways and Linking&#13;
Roads.  A team  of provincial personnel, local engineers and technicians, and&#13;
international consultants would be established to supervise the construction of the high-&#13;
grade highways and the linking roads. The joint supervision team (JST) would be headed&#13;
by a Chief Supervision Engineer. A Resident Engineer would be stationed on site for&#13;
each of the 17 civil works contracts. Terms of reference for the consultants were&#13;
approved by the Bank. Invitations to short-listed consulting firns (to be approved by the&#13;
Bank) for supervision of construction would be issued in February 1996. A firm would&#13;
be selected in July 1996. The consultants would be mobilized in September 1996 to&#13;
begin training of local personnel in construction supervision and help set up the&#13;
supervision organization.&#13;
3.53  RIPA.  The relevant highway departments at city or prefecture levels are&#13;
responsible for the preparation of designs and bid documents for the systems included in&#13;
RIPA and these documents would be reviewed and approved by SPHAB.  The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
construction of the systems included in the first package is expected to start in July 1996&#13;
and to be completed by March 1998. The construction of the subsystems to be included&#13;
in the second, third and fourth packages is expected to start in 1997, 1998 and 1999,&#13;
respectively, and to be completed by the end of 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. For&#13;
procurement purposes, RIPA systems will be divided into several manageable contract&#13;
(bid) sections. Construction of the RIPA roads will be supervised in accordance with the&#13;
arrangements summarized in para. 3.23.&#13;
3.54 Training. Because of the large size and diversity of the training component,&#13;
SPTD would appoint a full-time Institutional and Training Coordinator responsible for&#13;
managing the component. He would relate to all organizations in the sector with which&#13;
the component is concerned and would share financial control over the resources&#13;
allocated under this component. Formal selection procedures for candidates to be trained&#13;
would be developed and agreed with the Bank. Training abroad would be preceded by&#13;
training within China with the best performers selected for training abroad. Also, all&#13;
trainees to be sent abroad would have a good working knowledge of English or else&#13;
would take a three-month English language course prior to traveling abroad. Each trainee&#13;
would be required to submit a report on training received to his/her parent department or&#13;
agency. Moreover, SPTD has indicated that training to be provided under the project&#13;
would be related to career development and the professional growth of the selected staff.&#13;
At negotiations, agreement was reached that Shaanxi Province shall, by June 30 of each&#13;
year commencing in 1996, furnish a rolling two-year training implementation schedule to&#13;
the Bank and shall carry out the training under a program acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.55  Equipment. PEO would be responsible for procurement of equipment. The&#13;
equipment required for laboratories, environmental monitoring, strengthening of highway&#13;
network maintenance and institutional strengthening would be procured at an early stage&#13;
of project implementation (1996/97), while that for the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
high-grade highways is scheduled to be procured toward the end of the high-grade&#13;
highway construction (1998/1999).&#13;
3.56  The project as a whole is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 2001, with&#13;
the loan closing date stipulated as December 31, 2001. The implementation schedule for&#13;
the project is presented in Annex 7.&#13;
3.57 Operation and Maintenance of High-Grade Highways. Shaanxi Province&#13;
intends to operate the new highways as toll facilities consistent with their design. Tolls&#13;
would be collected at about 19 points (Map IBRD 27048). To ensure that the toll rates&#13;
would be appropriately structured and that toll levels would not lead to a substantial&#13;
reduction in the benefits of highway investment, the rationale for setting the level of&#13;
tolling would be determined based on the findings of a study to be undertaken by the&#13;
Province, which takes into consideration latest experience with operation of toll roads in&#13;
China as well as similar studies done under Bank-financed highway projects in China.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations from SPG that SPTD shall undertake, and by&#13;
June 30, 1999, furnish to the Bank for its review and comments, an analysis and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
recommendation for the structure of toll rates on the high-grade highways, taking into&#13;
consideration the results of the recent studies on toll rate structures under the Bank-&#13;
financed highway projects in China, and the recent experience with toll rates on major&#13;
roads in Shaanxi Province and other parts of China.&#13;
3.58 High-grade highways except LXH will be operated and maintained by SHGHAB,&#13;
with headquarters in Xian (Chart 11). This bureau is expected to establish three&#13;
management departments, among which one is in charge of Xian-Tongguan Expressway,&#13;
one in charge of Xian-Huangling Class I Highway, and the other in charge of Xian-Baoji&#13;
Highway. Under the Xian-Tongguan Expressway Management Department, there are&#13;
three Management Offices. One of these management offices is responsible for LTWMH&#13;
and the remaining two offices are responsible for WTE. The Xian-Huangling Class I&#13;
Highway Management Department has four management offices under its jurisdiction.&#13;
Two of these offices are in charge of THH. Also, the Xian-Baoji Highway Management&#13;
Department has four management offices, of which Jiangzhuang Management Office is&#13;
responsible for FJTH.&#13;
3.59 The Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Class II auto-only Highway will be operated and&#13;
maintained by SPHAB with two management offices in Heilongkou and Lantian.&#13;
Construction of these management offices, as well as their equipment needs, are included&#13;
in the proposed project. SHGHAB is already operating some high-grade highways in&#13;
Shaanxi and, following the institutional strengthening contained in the proposed project,&#13;
SHGHAB is expected to be capable of properly operating and maintaining the high-grade&#13;
highways.&#13;
1. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.60  Procurement under the project would be carried out as shown in the following&#13;
table. The procurement arrangements for the project have taken into account the&#13;
experience gained from previous Bank-financed highway projects. The documentation,&#13;
for procurement, which covers the prequalification of contractors, ICB and National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) for civil works, ICB for goods and consultant services&#13;
contracts has been standardized for Chinese conditions in cooperation between the&#13;
Chinese government and the Bank. Standard documents would be used for all relevant&#13;
procurement processes under the project.&#13;

3.61  Works. The civil works for the high-grade highways would be divided into 17&#13;
contract sections. WTE would be divided into five contract sections, THH into seven&#13;
contract sections, LXH and FJTH into two sections each, and one contract section for&#13;
LTWMH. Electromechanical works would be handled as three contracts. Administration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
and maintenance buildings, service areas and toll plazas would be carried out in several&#13;
small contracts. The linking roads (three road sections) would be included in the&#13;
corresponding contract sections of the main high-grade highways because of the small&#13;
size of the works involved. Contracts for civil works and for electromechanical works for&#13;
the high-grade highways (100 percent of total) with a total cost of $356.5 million would&#13;
be procured under ICB procedures. Contracts would be bid on a slice and package basis;&#13;
qualified firms would be allowed to bid for more than one contract so as to attract&#13;
international contractors and  large  Chinese  contractors.   The  contracts for&#13;
electromechanical works would be bid later during the construction of the high-grade&#13;
highways. All contractors for the 17 ICB contracts for civil works would be prequalified.&#13;
Domestic contractors competing under ICB would be eligible for a 7.5 percernt price&#13;
preference. Domestic contractors are expected to be competitive for all contracts under&#13;
this project&#13;
3.62  Other works, including small service facilities (toll plazas, maintenance depots,&#13;
service and rest areas, administrative buildings, etc.), Xian-Sanyuan Highway, and RIPA&#13;
roads, would be awarded following NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. These&#13;
works would involve contracts estimated to cost less than $2 million per contract, up to&#13;
an aggregate amount of about $59.7 million. Since these contracts are small in value and&#13;
scattered throughout the Province and would be implemented over a four-year period,&#13;
ICB would therefore be neither justified nor practical, but international firms would not&#13;
be precluded from bidding.&#13;
3.63 Based on experience with the Road Improvement Program (RIP) in the ongoing&#13;
Zhejiang (Loan 3471-CHA), Guangdong (Loan 3530-CHA, and Henan (Loan 3531-&#13;
CHA) Provincial Highway projects, generally not more than three bids are received for&#13;
contracts whose value is $2.0 million or less. Moreover, most of the bidders come from&#13;
the immediate area of the contract works. RIPA involves smaller works and lower value&#13;
contracts than RIP, and the works are spread over a very large geographic area. Hence,&#13;
for RIPA contracts whose cost is $0.5 million (Y 4.2 million) or less and up to $23.8&#13;
million in aggregate, simplified procurement procedures, whereby a minimum of three&#13;
bids are invited, would be followed. This has the advantages of time savings in the&#13;
bidding process as well as creating more job opportunities for the poor during&#13;
construction. Since employment creation is important in the case of RIPA roads, when&#13;
the two lowest evaluated bids are within 5 percent of each other, the number of local&#13;
people to be employed by each contractor would be considered in the final award of&#13;
contract. This will be done by assigning a value of Y 300 per person-month and by&#13;
deducting the value of employment from the bid price. The bidder with the lowest&#13;
"adjusted" evaluated bid price would be selected.&#13;
3.64 Implementation of the Xian-Sanyuan Highway involves a large number of small-&#13;
value contracts spread over a large geographic area. As this highway is already open to&#13;
traffic and carries a high traffic volume, these works have to be carried out with least&#13;
disruption to traffic. Hence, some of these works, with a total value of about $12.2&#13;
million would be procured through force account. Also, in the case of very small RIPA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
contracts, and under special conditions to be justified by SPHAB, force account could&#13;
also be used for procurement of civil works with a total estimated cost of 20 percent,&#13;
about $15.9 million, of the total RIPA component. Force account would also be used for&#13;
improvement of black spots, with a total estimated value of $1.6 million. This is justified&#13;
on the basis of the small value of the works and their wide geographic distribution. The&#13;
total estimated cost of the works to be procured by force account is $29.7 million.&#13;
3.65  Equipment. Generally, all contracts for goods and equipment costing more than&#13;
$250,000 equivalent would be awarded under ICB. However, for equipment where the&#13;
number of suppliers is small, limited international bidding would be followed, in an&#13;
aggregate amount not exceeding $1 million. All other items or groups of items covering&#13;
minor maintenance equipment, laboratories, research and environmental protection&#13;
purposes estimated to cost less than $250,000 per contract package, in an aggregate&#13;
amount not exceeding $2.5 million would be procured following shopping procedures on&#13;
the basis of a comparison of price quotations solicited from at least three suppliers&#13;
eligible under the Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Domestic manufactures competing&#13;
under ICB would be eligible for a margin of preference in the comparison of bids of&#13;
15 percent for goods, or the prevailing custom duties, whichever is lower.&#13;
3.66  Consultants. All consultants required for construction supervision, staff training&#13;
and studies of the Xian Bypass, highway maintenance, and highway safety would be&#13;
selected and employed under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank in accordance&#13;
with Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Local expertise available in the various&#13;
provincial universities and institutes in the highway subsector would be used as much as&#13;
possible.&#13;
3.67  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. SPTD requested advance&#13;
contracting and retroactive financing in the following areas:&#13;
(a)   Traffic Engineering for Xian-Sanyuan Highway. This would allow&#13;
safe operation of this road as a fully access-controlled highway by mid-&#13;
1997. The amount subject to retroactive financing is estimated at about&#13;
$2.3 million.&#13;
(b)   Consultants for the Study of the Xian Bypass. This would allow timely&#13;
preparation of the study of alternatives and selection of best alternative to&#13;
ensure continuity of a high level of traffic service on the east-west trunk&#13;
highway (312) through Xian. The amount subject to retroactive financing&#13;
is about $60,000.&#13;
(c)   Consultants for Development of RDB. This would ensure completion of&#13;
development of a provincial level RDB, before the end of 1998, to serve&#13;
as an important input into MOC's plans for development of a national&#13;
RDB. The amount subject to retroactive financing is about $100,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
3.68   Agreement to the above three requests for advance contracting and retroactive&#13;
financing is recommended, subject to SPTD completing all Bank requirements, including&#13;
those for procurement, environment and resettlement. The total amount subject to&#13;
retroactive financing is estimated at about $2.5 million. All of this amount would apply&#13;
to expenditures after July 1, 1995.&#13;
3.69   Bank Review.  Prior review procedures would be used for:  (a) civil works&#13;
contracts with an estimated cost of $2 million (Y 17 million) or more; (b) equipment with&#13;
an estimated cost of more than $250,000 per contract; and (c) consulting services with an&#13;
estimated contract cost of more than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals.&#13;
This represents about 76 percent and 71 per cent of the estimated value of works contracts&#13;
and goods respectively. For contracts below the above-mentioned limits, post-review&#13;
procedures would be followed.&#13;
J. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.70   The proposed Bank loan of $210 million would be disbursed over a period of&#13;
about six years, as follows:&#13;
Category                           Amount of the     Percent of Expenditures to be Financed&#13;

Total                                 210.0&#13;
3.71   To  facilitate disbursements, a Special Account would be opened with an&#13;
authorized allocation of $17 million equivalent, the estimated average expenditures for a&#13;
four-month period. The account would be opened in US dollars in a bank acceptable to&#13;
the Bank, and managed by the Shaanxi Provincial Finance Bureau. Applications for&#13;
replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or whenever the&#13;
Special Account is drawn down to 50 percent of its initial deposit, whichever comes first.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Table 3.6, which takes into&#13;
consideration the project disbursement profile for transport projects in China and the&#13;
potential risks of delay in project implementation.&#13;
3.72  Disbursements would be made against authorized payment requests for work done&#13;
under priced contracts for the civil works and for the delivery and installation of the&#13;
equipment. Interim certification of civil works completed and costed at unit rates in the&#13;
contracts will be prepared by the contractors, reviewed by the supervision teams/units and&#13;
payments authorized by PEO. Retroactive financing of up to $2.5 million would be&#13;
applied to expenditures made after July 1, 1995 for providing full access control to the&#13;
Xian-Sanyuan Highway and consultants for the Xian Bypass Study and the Highway&#13;
Maintenance Study. Disbursements for staff training in China or abroad would be made&#13;
from the Special Account against the actual costs of travel, subsistence and tuition or&#13;
training fees. For expenditures relating to contracts for works of $2 million of less,&#13;
training, force account, contracts for goods, each valued at $250,000 equivalent or less,&#13;
and contracts for services each valued at $100,000 equivalent or less for firms and&#13;
$50,000 equivalent or less for individuals, reimbursement would be made on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting SOEs would be retained&#13;
by the implementing agencies and made available for review by the Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
K. AUDITING&#13;
3.73  The Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of the State Auditing Administration&#13;
(SAA) would be responsible for auditing of project expenditures. Actual audits would be&#13;
carried out for SAA by the Shaanxi Branch of SAA or the Shaanxi Provincial Audit&#13;
Administration Agreement was reached with SPG during negotiations that the project&#13;
accounts and the Special Accounts, including SOEs, would be audited annually by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that audit reports would be sent to the&#13;
Bank for review within six months of the close of each fiscal year. In the case of the&#13;
SOEs, the audit report would contain a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the&#13;
SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls&#13;
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals. The&#13;
Bank Group currently accepts SAA audits for this purpose.&#13;
L. PROJECT SUPERVISION, REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
3.74  Supervision. The project would be supervised through Bank missions whose&#13;
frequency would be guided by the progress of the works. However, on the average, a&#13;
mission at about nine-month intervals would be mounted; a Supervision Mission Plan is&#13;
presented in Annex 8. In addition to field missions, staff input would be provided at&#13;
headquarters for project-related activities such as completion of supervision reports,&#13;
procurement documentation and contracts, staff training and equipment proposals and&#13;
follow-up and review of the studies on the Xian Bypass, highway safety, and highway&#13;
maintenance. Moreover, the Bank would monitor progress of implementation of all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
project components through quarterly progress reports to be submitted to the Bank. In&#13;
addition, SPTD would submit to the Bank monthly reports on progress of works for the&#13;
high-grade highways. A copy of each of the outline quarter and monthly progress reports&#13;
is available in the Project File. It is estimated that over the implementation period of the&#13;
project the total time expended on supervision would be in the order of 80 person-weeks.&#13;
3.75  Monitoring.  During implementation, project performance, including the&#13;
achievement of physical targets and attainment of other project objectives will be&#13;
monitored by SPTD, PEO, SHGHAB and SHAB through the use of performance&#13;
indicators, reports on the environment and land acquisition and resettlement, progress&#13;
reports and auditing of project accounts. In addition, upon completion, the project will be&#13;
reviewed in an Implementation Completion Report. Annex 9 presents the outline&#13;
monitoring plan for the project. The plan defines for each of the project components&#13;
indices that will track annual progress in attaining targets during implementation and&#13;
impact objectives after the project is completed. The plan specifies how, with what&#13;
frequency and by whom, the data for the indicators will be collected. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that SPTD shall, on the basis of performance indicators&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, prepare and furnish to the Bank by March 31 of each year&#13;
commencing in 1997 and ending three years after completion of the project, an annual&#13;
monitoring report, in a form satisfactory to the Bank covering all components of the&#13;
project and assessing the extent to which different implementation and development&#13;
objectives have been attained in the course ofproject execution and operation.&#13;
3.76  Reporting. Based on the monitoring activities described in Annex 9, SPTD will&#13;
submit to the Bank an annual monitoring report. This report will be based on the&#13;
following reports, which will be submitted to the Bank during the course of a given year:&#13;
(a)   A  series of internal and external (independent) monitoring reports&#13;
assessing the impact of land acquisition and resettlement on various&#13;
segments of the local population, describing the income restoration&#13;
strategies followed and the number of people rehabilitated (para. 3.43 and&#13;
Annex 6);&#13;
(b)   Annual environmental monitoring reports during the construction phase&#13;
and the first three years of the operation phase of the high-grade highways&#13;
(Annex 5);&#13;
(c)   Annual audit reports for the project accounts and financial statements&#13;
(para. 3.73);&#13;
(d)   Quarterly progress reports for all project activities (including highway&#13;
safety) and up-to-date performance indicators (para. 3.74);&#13;
(e)   A report, by an independent agency/expert, on the completion of the&#13;
highway safety component within six months of the completion of this&#13;
component; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
(f)   A Project Implementation Completion Report would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the loan closing date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
4.1   The economic analysis for the proposed project focuses on the civil works&#13;
components that, together with associated construction supervision and design, survey,&#13;
and testing, account for over 97 percent of the project base cost. There are two major&#13;
subcomponents: (a) the five high-grade highways and their linking roads, and (b) the&#13;
RIPA component. Because of the relatively short length and corresponding low&#13;
construction cost of the linking roads (21 km for roads), no separate economic analyses&#13;
were conducted for these roads. Instead, they were included in the analyses for the high-&#13;
grade highways.  The economic analyses were initially prepared by the Shaanxi&#13;
Provincial Highway Survey and Design Institute (SPHSDI) and were reviewed and&#13;
updated by the Bank staff in consultation with SPHSDI personnel during project&#13;
preparation and appraisal.&#13;
A. MAIN BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES&#13;
4.2   Benefits from the project would accrue to road users in the form of transport cost&#13;
and time savings.  Many road users are own-account operators for the producer&#13;
enterprises and, mostly in rural areas, a growing segment of privately-owned operators&#13;
and farmers, who would capture the benefits of the project directly. Public freight and&#13;
passenger services are also likely to respond to increased competition so that transport&#13;
costs savings would be passed on to the users. Passengers would, in addition, enjoy the&#13;
time savings offered by the project, and the greater riding comfort from better road&#13;
surfaces. In the case of RIPA subprojects, social benefits will accrue in the form of&#13;
improved access to health and educational facilities and access to clean drinking water&#13;
(resulting in lower death rates, fewer work days lost due to sickness, lower educational&#13;
dropout rates and increased adult literacy level) and a reduction in expenditures for the&#13;
food-for-work program. Also, the feeling of "isolation" would be reduced and the greater&#13;
reliability of transport service resulting from the provision of all-weather roads should&#13;
provide incentives for more intensive and diversified productive activities.&#13;
4.3   The project is intended to encourage better highway management and&#13;
maintenance through institutional strengthening of various departments, institutes and&#13;
training schools of SPTD, the studies of the Xian Bypass and highway maintenance, and&#13;
the provision of modem maintenance equipment. The road safety program can be&#13;
expected to result in a reduced number of accidents due to the support it gives to the&#13;
traffic police and SPTD and due to the demonstration effect of the accident black spot&#13;
pilot program. The project also is intended to strengthen public works procurement&#13;
procedures and to upgrade management of the construction entities. The proper design of&#13;
all highways included in the infrastructure components of the project should reduce the&#13;
number of accidents, and reduced congestion on the existing roads along the high-grade&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
highways should improve conditions for local traffic, including bicycles and agricultural&#13;
vehicles.&#13;
B. EVALUATION OF HIGH-GRADE HIGHWAYS&#13;
4.4   Economic evaluation was conducted for each of the five high-grade highways&#13;
included in the project. SPHSPDI prepared a separate technical feasibility study for each&#13;
of these highways. These studies form the basis for the presentation in this report and are&#13;
available in the project file.&#13;
4.5   Weinan-Tongguan Highway (WTH). The existing Weinan-Tongguan Highway&#13;
(WTH, No. 310) has a low technical standard (mostly Class III) with many sections with&#13;
steep grades or sharp curves, and bridges and culverts with limited loading capacities for&#13;
modem heavy-load truck traffic. Also, many sections carry traffic volumes that exceed&#13;
their capacity, particularly along the built-up sections of the road. During 1990-92,&#13;
annual traffic accidents averaged about 454 in total, resulting in 45 fatalities and 208&#13;
injuries.&#13;
4.6   Tongchuan-Huangling Highway (THH).  About one third of the existing&#13;
highway has been improved to Class II standard with the remaining two thirds still Class&#13;
III. Several sections have steep grades reaching 9 percent and very sharp horizontal&#13;
curves. Again, as in the case of WTH, the existing culverts and bridges limit the size and&#13;
weight of trucks that can pass over them. During snowfall in the winter, the road is&#13;
blocked on the average two to three times a year, each lasting four to five days. The&#13;
existing traffic volumes exceed the capacity of many sections of this highway. Many&#13;
accidents occur on this highway, with an annual average of about 385 accidents resulting&#13;
in 39 dead and 86 injured people.&#13;
4.7   Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Highway (LXH). The existing highway has a very low&#13;
technical standard (mostly Class IV) with some sections below that. This road lies in the&#13;
Qinling Mountains, has narrow pavement width (generally 6.0 to 6.5 m, but with some&#13;
sections of 5.0 m width), contains many sections with very steep grades and/or very sharp&#13;
curves, and poor sight distance. The operating speed is about 25 to 30 km per hour. As&#13;
in the case of WTH and THH, the capacity of this road is exceeded at various sections&#13;
and the bridges and culverts restrict the size and load of trucks that can travel on this&#13;
highway. Also, the road is blocked by snow and by traffic accidents. During 1988-90&#13;
(the latest available data), accidents averaged 117 per year, resulting in 19 fatalities and&#13;
103 injuries.&#13;
4.8   Famen Buddhist Temple-Jiangzhuang-Tangyu Highway (FJTH).  The&#13;
existing highways are Class III, and deficient from the standpoints of traffic capacity,&#13;
strength of pavement and geometrical (vertical and horizontal) alignment.  Traffic&#13;
accidents in 1992-93 (latest available information) on Jiangzhuang-Famensi Highway&#13;
averaged about 24 per year, resulting in 1 dead and 16 injured persons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
4.9    Traffic on the Existing Roads. There was a moderate to high growth in traffic&#13;
throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, of between 10 and 17 percent per year. The&#13;
following table provides a summary of the most recently available comprehensive traffic&#13;
data, and compares the daily traffic total with the estimated highway capacity. Many&#13;
sections of the existing highways are operating at or above capacity, and given the high&#13;
projected traffic growth rates, substantial additional capacity will be needed for all of&#13;
them by the end of the decade. More detailed traffic data is provided in Tables 4.1a&#13;

4.10   The presence of mixed traffic, including slow-moving nonmotorized vehicles and&#13;
relatively high traffic volumes compared to the capacity of the existing roads, result in&#13;
traffic speeds of about 30 to 40 km/hour for motor vehicles with urbanized sections&#13;
presenting often substantial delays. The high frequency of accidents and breakdowns of&#13;
vehicles cause long traffic delays on the 2-lane existing highways, where emergency&#13;
vehicles have difficulty in reaching the accident site.&#13;
4.11  Traffic Projections. Origin-destination (O-D) surveys were conducted to provide&#13;
a good basis for traffic projection and allocation, in particular diversion from the existing&#13;
roads to the new highways. Traffic projections for the proposed new highways take into&#13;
consideration diversion of traffic from the existing highways and generation of traffic&#13;
through (a) releasing suppressed demand by capacity limits on the existing highways,&#13;
especially in the sections close to urban areas; and (b) by the facilitation of economic&#13;
growth. Diversion of traffic from the railway was considered where pertinent-in the&#13;
case of WTE. A comprehensive study of coal production and transport in northern&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
Shaanxi was conducted in order to detennine the modal split of coal traffic between rail&#13;
and THH and the volume of coal traffic to be carried by THH. Also, the trend toward use&#13;
of heavier trucks that carry larger loads of coal was assumed to accelerate if the THH&#13;
were to be built. In the case of FJTH, special consideration was given to the transfer of&#13;
traffic from tractors to trucks.&#13;
4.12  Growth rates for traffic along the various high-grade highways were based&#13;
primarily on the economic growth rates for the area of influence of each highway.&#13;
Because of the uncertainty in forecasting economic growth rates, three scenarios were&#13;
analyzed: high growth, medium growth and low growth. Economic growth rates took&#13;
into account the plans of the state, province, prefectures, municipalities and counties&#13;
within the area of influence of each high-grade highway.&#13;
4.13  It is now recognized that the diversion of traffic from an existing road to a new&#13;
toll road takes time to build up to the long-term equilibrium level. Incentives and&#13;
inducements are often offered to shorten the period of buildup, sometimes referred to as&#13;
the "ramp period." The equilibrium level of diversion for the new highways was&#13;
estimated at about 80 percent, except for the Jiangzhuang-Famensi (68 percent),&#13;
Jiangzhuang-Tangyu (60 percent) and Lintong-Terra Cotta Warriors Museum&#13;
(23 percent) highways, which will have a number of alternative routes available. Traffic&#13;
would also be generated by the improvements brought about by the new highway, at a&#13;
level estimated at about 6 to 8 percent of normal traffic. The projected traffic volumes for&#13;
each high-grade highway by section and that remaining on the existing road(s) for the&#13;
medium-growth scenario and for cases both with and without tolls, for the years 2000,&#13;
2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 (2018 in some cases) are presented in Tables 4.2a through 4.2f.&#13;
The corresponding traffic volume projections for the low- and high-growth scenarios are&#13;
available in the technical feasibility study reports.&#13;
4.14  The Proposed New High-Grade Highways. On the basis of the traffic forecasts&#13;
summarized in these Tables, the appropriate technical standard for each high-grade&#13;
highway was determined, as shown in Table 3.3 Staged construction (building a two-lane&#13;
Class II highway initially and expanding it in the future to a four-lane expressway) was&#13;
considered for the Qilicun-Baijia section (near the Henan Border) of WTE and for the&#13;
THH. However, it was rejected in both cases because the net present value of the total&#13;
transport cost (construction cost plus maintenance cost plus vehicle operating cost) for the&#13;
four-lane expressway was found to be lower than that for staged construction.&#13;
4.15  Alternative Alignments. The recommended alignment for each of the high-&#13;
grade highways was selected after consultation with the affected local and regional&#13;
governments from several alternative alignments on the basis of minimization of total&#13;
transport costs, amount and difficulty of land acquisition and resettlement, and&#13;
archeological and environmental considerations.  Besides the existing road, three&#13;
alternative alignments were considered for WTE, two for THH and two for the doubling&#13;
of the existing highway frorn Yaoxian to Tongchuan, four for LXH, three for FJTH, and&#13;
two for LTCWMH. In addition, the selected alignments focused on analyses of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
alternatives for the different difficult and expensive high-cost items such as tunnels for&#13;
THH and LXH, very long bridges, soft soils, and large-scale flooding such as in the case&#13;
of WTE.&#13;
4.16  Economic Analysis. The economic analysis was carried out separately for each&#13;
of the five high-grade highways. For the purpose of calculation of the indices of&#13;
economic analyses, the highways were divided into sections as shown in Tables 4.4a&#13;
through 4.4d. The economic analysis was prepared using April 1995 prices. Only the&#13;
medium and low traffic projections were used. Two toll options were analyzed, operation&#13;
of the highway with tolls and without tolls. The economic costs were derived from&#13;
financial costs by deducting taxes and duties and price contingencies. The cost of&#13;
materials were adjusted on the basis of border prices and that of land on the basis of the&#13;
net market value of the land's production.&#13;
4.17  Each high-grade highway was assumed to be constructed according to the&#13;
implementation program depicted in Annex 7 and to have an economic life of 20 years.&#13;
In addition to the cost of construction, the costs of period maintenance (pavement&#13;
overlays) in the eighth and sixteenth year after the road is put into operation and the&#13;
annual costs of routine highway maintenance and toll operations were included. The&#13;
residual value of each highway section was assumed to be 50 percent of the initial&#13;
construction cost.&#13;
4.18  Benefits were estimated to accrue primarily from savings in vehicle operating&#13;
costs and travel time. Additional quantifiable benefits arise from generated traffic,&#13;
reduced congestion on the existing road, and savings in accident costs.  Average&#13;
economic vehicle operating costs by vehicle class for the existing and proposed roads are&#13;
shown in Table 4.3. These costs vary by vehicle speed, which in turn varies with the&#13;
traffic volume and the capacity of the highway. The benefits due to reduction in traffic&#13;
accidents took account only of the savings in physical damage to vehicles and were&#13;
estimated by assuming that the accident rate on the new highway is one half of that on the&#13;
existing road.&#13;
4.19  Effect of Tolls. It is intended that the five high-grade highways be operated as&#13;
toll roads, which would involve higher costs of construction and operation, due to the toll&#13;
facilities, and a loss of potential benefits. Imposition of tolls would have the effect of&#13;
reducing traffic volumes along the high-grade highways. There is not yet enough&#13;
practical experience in China to forecast accurately the impact of tolls on traffic volumes,&#13;
economic viability and financial viability of the tolled highways. Tolls would be set at a&#13;
level to pay back the loans involved (the Bank loan in the case of this project) and not the&#13;
whole construction cost. Usually, they are set at about one third of the difference in&#13;
vehicle operating costs between the existing highway and the new tolled highways.&#13;
Generally, this level of toll is expected to reduce traffic volumes by about 20 percent.&#13;
However, toll levels would not be known until the highway is about to be open to traffic.&#13;
SPTD is to submit to the Bank by June 30, 1999 a study of the tolls to be charged on the&#13;
high-grade highways (para. 3.57).&#13;
&#13;

4.20   The results of the basic economic evaluations of the highways are shown in the&#13;
following table, with more complete results shown in Tables 4.4a through 4.4d. These&#13;
tables show the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for both the medium and low&#13;
traffic projections, with and without tolls in each case. The table shows that the expected&#13;
value of the EIRR, assuming that both the medium- and low-traffic projections have a&#13;
50 percent probability of occurrence, and that all these values are above the minimum&#13;
acceptable value. The full sets of economic analyses showing the streams of annual costs&#13;
and benefits and the EIRRs and sensitivity analyses for each high-grade highway by&#13;
section for high, medium and low traffic growth scenarios and with and without tolls are&#13;
available in the engineering feasibility study report for the various high-grade highways.&#13;

projects.&#13;
4.21    Sensitivity Tests. The EIRRs in Tables 4.4a through 4.4d, summarized in the&#13;
following table, show the impacts of changes that could affect the economic justification&#13;
of constructing the new highways. They show the impact of eliminating the value&#13;
attrib-uted-to savings in the time of the vehicle occupants, of a halving in the effect of the&#13;
new highways in generating additional traffic and of adopting a low forecast of traffic&#13;
growth. The following table also shows what increases in project costs or reductions in&#13;
project benefits would be necessary to result in their having unacceptably low values of&#13;
EIRR.   With  very  few  exceptions, the sensitivity  tests indicate that it would be&#13;
economically feasible to construct the highways as proposed and operate them as toll&#13;
facilities. The four exceptions, which merit further comment, are Lintong to Terra Cotta&#13;
Warriors Maseum. Famensi to Jiangzhuang and Famensi to Tangyu with a low traffic&#13;
projection, and Lintong to Terra Cotta Warriors Museum with a zero value of time&#13;
savings.&#13;

Note: Basic evaluation is for medium level traffic projection, with tolls applied to the proposed new road.&#13;
When the economic evaluations were made, the Famensi-Tangyu Highway was considered as two independent projects.&#13;
4.22   The road to the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum  is a tourist road. The number of&#13;
tourists is difficult to predict and has shown large variations in growth in the last 10&#13;
years. The numbers of national tourists appears to be closely correlated with the state of&#13;
the national economy, while the number of international tourists appears to be closely&#13;
correlated with China's political relationship with Japan and the United States, the origin&#13;
countries of most foreign tourists. The projected growth in the number of tourists has&#13;
been estimated conservatively based on the growth in the last 10 years, but there are&#13;
expectations of a higher tourism growth in a period of stability in China's international&#13;
relations. So, in the case of this highway, the probability of a high traffic outcome is&#13;
greater than the zero value assumed generally (para. 4.23). It would need a probability of&#13;
only 10 percent to be attached to the high traffic forecast for all the sensitivity tests of the&#13;
Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Highway to produce acceptable results, and this level of&#13;
probability is appropriate for this particular highway. The implications of a zero value of&#13;
time savings is that tourists would be prepared to spend all their time in traffic jams&#13;
waiting to reach the sites they wish to visit rather than visiting the sites themselves. This&#13;
is a highly improbable assumption, particularly for the type of visitor to the Terra Cotta&#13;
Warriors Museum, most of whom visit the museum for a single day and wish to&#13;
maximize their time at this important site. So the importance of a zero time value&#13;
evaluation of the project is relatively low.&#13;
4.23   Similar arguments apply to the Jiangzhuang-Famensi Highway, which leads to the&#13;
Famensi Temple, a historic site of major international significance, having been the&#13;
center of Chinese civilization in the Early Zhou period and considered to be the source of&#13;
many aspects of Chinese culture. The pagoda at the Famensi Temple dates back at least&#13;
to the second century A.D. Four pieces of finger bone revealed when the pagoda&#13;
collapsed following an earthquake in 1986 (it has since been reconstructed) are widely&#13;
credited with being those of Buddha and are possibly the holiest religious relics in&#13;
Buddhism. When the proximity to the Temple to the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum is&#13;
considered, the number of foreign tourists likely to visit the Temple is expected to&#13;
increase rapidly and the number of national visitors will also increase rapidly as it is&#13;
becoming a center for Buddhist worship again. For this reason, the expected value of the&#13;
EIRR of the project should take account of a greater than zero probability of the high&#13;
traffic projection and as with the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Highway, a probability of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
just over 10 percent or more for the high traffic projection would be sufficient to make&#13;
the expected value of the EIRR acceptable.&#13;
4.24  Additional sensitivity tests were carried out in relation to the Tongchuan-&#13;
Huangling Highway, to investigate the optimization of the opening date of this Highway,&#13;
given that more than half the traffic on this road comprises trucks carrying coal from two&#13;
groups of mines, those at Yijun and Huangling itself. Both groups of mines are close to&#13;
the proposed alignment of the Highway. In the medium projection for the economy, coal&#13;
production in Huangling is projected to more than triple between 1990 and 2000, from&#13;
4.41 million tons to 15 million tons. Even in the low projection, output is expected to&#13;
reach 13.55 million tons. In the same level of projection, self-consumption of coal in&#13;
Huangling for the year 2000 is projected at 300,000 tons, while a further 270,500 tons&#13;
will be transported north. The railway will have capacity for only 12 million tons,&#13;
leaving about 2.4 million tons to be transported south by road. When, as in this case, the&#13;
estimated road traffic is the difference between two rather uncertain projections, then the&#13;
confidence that can be placed on the estimates is even less than usual, and given the high&#13;
proportion of coal trucks on the THH, particular attention must be paid to the sensitivity&#13;
of economic evaluation results to variations in the traffic projections.&#13;
4.25  Most of the coal produced at the Huangling mine is transported by rail, so far as&#13;
the railway has capacity, to the high consumption areas in the south of China , and the&#13;
excess is transported by road to Tongchuan or Xian. Coal transported by road, with a&#13;
final destination outside Shaanxi, is transferred to rail at Tongchuan, while coal for&#13;
domestic and commercial consumption in Xian is transported all the way by road. The&#13;
Huangling mines cannot transport all their output by rail because of the limited capacity&#13;
of the rail link and the future need of the railway to transport the increased output of&#13;
mines in the north of Shaanxi where road transport is not a viable alternative. A new rail&#13;
line from Xian to the north of Shaanxi was opened in 1991, but its capacity for&#13;
transporting coal to the south of China is constrained by the capacity of the Lintong-Xian&#13;
section, which it must use to reach its destination.&#13;
4.26  The existing mines in the Huangling group are nearing the end of their productive&#13;
life but will be replaced by new mines currently being developed. The rate of production&#13;
of these new mines will be constrained by the capacity of the transport systems that serve&#13;
them. The proposed THH will provide sufficient capacity for the mines to operate close&#13;
to or at their optimum technical rate of production. The mines at Yijun, which are part of&#13;
the Jiaoping mining area, also have problems of transport capacity for their output, with&#13;
the rail link only having capacity for 4.7 million tons compared with a current and&#13;
projected output of 6 million tons. The highway system is having to provide capacity for&#13;
about 1.3 million tons, a figure that is not expected to change significantly over the next&#13;
20 years.&#13;
4.27  As part of the evaluation of the alternative of phased construction, an analysis was&#13;
made of the optimum opening date for the first phase, of the full four-lane THH. It was&#13;
found that the optimum opening date was as early as possible, and that the net economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52-&#13;
benefits of the project reduced by about 10 percent for each year of delay up to five years,&#13;
and escalated much faster for further delay. The traffic need for the second stage would&#13;
be only about four to five years after completion of the first stage, but the earthworks and&#13;
civil works component of the total cost amounts to more than 65 percent of the total and&#13;
all this must be incurred from the outset. Not surprisingly in these circumstances, the&#13;
economically preferable solution turns out to be to construct the road in a single stage.&#13;
C. EVALUATION OF RIPA COMPONENT&#13;
4.28  The RIPA component of the project is aimed at rehabilitating and upgrading&#13;
basic-access roads in low-income counties of the province, with a view to increasing&#13;
accessibility to basic health, social and education services as well as to markets to&#13;
increase the social sustainability of these areas. It is expected that in the long term, the&#13;
program will stimulate increased economic activity and employment and significantly&#13;
contribute to a reduction of rural poverty.&#13;
4.29  The nature of the expected benefits of the component precludes many of them&#13;
from a quantified analysis, and many others can only be estimated approximately, so the&#13;
expressed economic rates of return must be considered as minima and as representing&#13;
only part of the value of this project component. For the first year subprojects of this&#13;
component, the quantified benefits include only reductions in vehicle operating costs,&#13;
reduced accident costs, and time savings to vehicle occupants. Unquantified benefits&#13;
include improved health, higher education achievement, increased social relations, and&#13;
increased output and incomes.  For second and subsequent year subprojects, the&#13;
quantified benefits will take account of generated trips for health, social, education,&#13;
employment and commercial purposes. The total population that will benefit from this&#13;
component is the total population in the area of influence of the proposed highway&#13;
systems in the selected counties with a low income. The counties for inclusion in the&#13;
subproject were selected using a mix of economic and social indicators. A total of 31&#13;
road systems with a length of 4,067 km in 25 counties were chosen for rehabilitation,&#13;
upgrading or new construction. The total number of people who are expected to benefit&#13;
from the RIPA component is about 2.72 million, or about 54 percent of the poor in&#13;
Shaanxi Province. Only those components identified for inclusion in the first year of the&#13;
project have been evaluated. These projects will benefit about 520,000 people. The&#13;
estimated economic rate of return for these five systems varied from 13.5 to 18.7 percent&#13;
with an average of 15.6 percent (Table 4.5).&#13;
D. PROJECT RISKS AND ACTIONS&#13;
4.30  The principal risks facing the project are:&#13;
(a)   delay in completion of the connecting road between the WTE and the&#13;
continuation of Route 310 in Henan province;&#13;
(b)   delays in completion of the highways themselves as a consequence of&#13;
design changes;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
(c)   maintaining a high quality of construction when there is strong pressure&#13;
for the projects to be con'pleted on time and within budget;&#13;
(d)   ensuring that sufficient funds are allocated to maintenance of the&#13;
remainder of the highway network when there is strong pressure to&#13;
complete the construction of the project and other new highways;&#13;
(e)   ensuring that operational efficiency and traffic safety are accorded high&#13;
priority;&#13;
(f)   that the traffic projections will not be realized, that traffic will not divert to&#13;
the new highways to the extent projected and that users will not take full&#13;
advantage of these and other new highways to update their vehicles to&#13;
introduce larger and more cost effective trucks.&#13;
4.31  (a) Connecting Road.  The first significant risk facing the project is the&#13;
possibility of delay in completing construction of the 6.1 km connection between Yangjia&#13;
and Baijiazhai, which would affect the utilization (and consequently the benefits) of the&#13;
Weinan-Tongguan Expressway. However, this risk has practically disappeared since the&#13;
connection has been included in the proposed Second Henan Provincial Highway Project,&#13;
which is expected to be presented to the Board in June 1996.&#13;
4.32  (b) Design Changes. Based on experience with the ongoing highway projects,&#13;
risks center on delays in implementation, particularly for the highway investment&#13;
component, due to design changes and the long time required to handle variation orders&#13;
during construction as well as to the late start in the traffic engineering component,&#13;
objections raised by people living along the right-of-way caused by insufficient&#13;
consultation, and unexpected archeological finds. However, preparation of this project&#13;
has benefited significantly from the Bank's experience in similar highway projects in&#13;
China, as well as from the active involvement of MOC and the review of the design and&#13;
bid documents for the high-grade highways by qualified experts.  Moreover, the&#13;
conceptual design of the traffic engineering component has been completed and more&#13;
attention is being given to the resettlement and land acquisition problem, including more&#13;
consultation with the local people affected by the high-grade highways. Extensive&#13;
archeological surveys were conducted to reduce the probability of unexpected finds.&#13;
Also, the relatively large value of contracts for construction of the high-grade highways&#13;
would attract the larger and more capable contractors and would ensure successful&#13;
completion with little or no delays.&#13;
4.33  (c) Construction Quality and Cost Overruns.  Uneven and sometimes&#13;
substandard quality of works as well as cost overruns are another risk that should be&#13;
addressed. This problem is generally caused by laxity of construction supervision as well&#13;
as the points mentioned in para. 4.32. In this project, more attention will be given to&#13;
construction supervision arrangements, including engagement of foreign experts and&#13;
training of local supervision staff. Also, the Bank will increase its supervision efforts by&#13;
involving the Resident Mission and utilizing local consultants in the supervision of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

RIPA component. In addition, SPTD is one of the strongest provincial highway&#13;
organizations in China and is familiar with Bank procedures since the proposed project is&#13;
the second highway project to be financed by the Bank in Shaanxi Province.&#13;
4.34 (d) Allocation of Resources to Highway Maintenance. In view of the relatively&#13;
fast expansion of the NTHS and other high-grade highways and their related high&#13;
construction costs, there is growing danger that not enough resources will be devoted to&#13;
the maintenance of non high-grade highways, including roads contained in the RIPA&#13;
component under the project. As pointed out in para. 3.28, SPTD has agreed to allocate&#13;
sufficient resources to highway maintenance during the 9FYP and continue to monitor&#13;
the condition of existing roads. The proposed project includes a study of highway&#13;
maintenance, training of staff in highway maintenance, and provision of equipment for&#13;
highway maintenance.&#13;
4.35  (e) Operational Efficiency and Traffic Safety. Recent experience suggests that&#13;
once the high-grade highways are in operation, operational and safety risks will need to&#13;
be addressed. The traffic engineering component of the project will be reviewed by&#13;
qualified technical experts. Also, the proposed project includes equipment and training of&#13;
staff for the operation and maintenance of the high-grade highways. SPTD would further&#13;
benefit from a study of management, operations and maintenance of high-grade highways&#13;
to be included in the proposed Second Henan Provincial Highway Project.&#13;
4.36  The success of the highway safety component also depends on good cooperation&#13;
between SPTD and the Traffic Police, which has in the past been difficult. However,&#13;
under the proposed project, a Leading Group for Road Safety Coordination will be&#13;
created, and consideration is being given to holding a highway safety seminar in China in&#13;
1997 to help raise awareness of the safety problem and to increase the level of support at&#13;
various governmental levels to this very important issue.&#13;
4.37 (f) Traffic Growth, Diversion to the New Highways and Truck Replacement&#13;
Policy. The medium projections of traffic growth are dependent on a continued growth&#13;
in the national and provincial economy and the maintenance of a high rate of growth for a&#13;
period of 20 years. With the exception of the subprojects described in para. 4.21, all of&#13;
the highways show an acceptable result for their economic evaluation, even with low&#13;
traffic projections that would result in traffic levels about 60 percent of those of the&#13;
medium-level projection. The risk that traffic will not even reach the level of the low&#13;
traffic projection is very low and would only arise if there were to be a collapse of the&#13;
national economy, not considered a significant risk.&#13;
4.38  A greater risk is that traffic will not divert to the new highways in the volumes&#13;
expected (para. 4.13) and that measures would be taken to induce a higher use of these&#13;
highways that would significantly reduce their economic benefit. Experience from China&#13;
and other countries indicates that it takes about four years for the traffic diversion to a&#13;
new road to build up to its expected level, and that it is essential for maximizing the final&#13;
diversion rate that this period be used for an intense promotion of the benefits of the new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
highway to potential users. There is a significant risk that if the diversion to the new&#13;
highways is not as high as projected, especially in the early years of their operation, the&#13;
Shaanxi High-Grade Highway Administration Bureau might be tempted to introduce&#13;
measures to artificially increase the diversion, such as increasing the level of tolls on&#13;
parallel unimproved roads or cutting back on maintenance or development of those roads.&#13;
Any such policy, while possibly resulting in a more favorable financial outcome to the&#13;
SHGHAB, will at the same time reduce the economic benefit of the new highways and&#13;
should therefore be discouraged. This risk can be reduced by ensuring that all possible&#13;
measures are taken that do not increase the costs of using the parallel roads but that do&#13;
increase the attractiveness of the new highways. Such measures would be proposed by&#13;
the technical assistance for institutional development in relation to operation of the new&#13;
highways.&#13;
4.39  The lack of a high-grade national highway network is a severe impediment to the&#13;
introduction of high-capacity and high-efficiency large trucks. Although the construction&#13;
of such a network is a necessary condition for the use of such trucks, many other&#13;
conditions must also be created for their use to become widespread. If these measures are&#13;
not taken and truck operators continue to use two-axle trucks, the expected benefits of the&#13;
new highways will not be fully realized. Many of the other necessary conditions need to&#13;
be applied at a national level and to be taken in coordination by several different&#13;
ministries. Since China does not have a good record of interministerial cooperation in the&#13;
transport sector, there is a significant risk that these conditions will not be created. It will&#13;
require pressure from truck operators for the necessary policy changes to be made, and&#13;
this in turn will require pressure from the clients of truck operators for more efficient&#13;
services.  The results of a study of traffic facilitation across provincial boundaries,&#13;
included in the National Highway Project: Hebei/Henan (Loan 3748-CHA), will be used&#13;
as a basis for Hebei and Henan Provinces to implement changes in this regard, and these&#13;
could also be of benefit to Shaanxi and other provinces in China. SPTD should monitor&#13;
the progress of these changes and act to implement those of them that produce positive&#13;
results.&#13;

ANNEX 1: ROADS IMPROVEMENT FOR POVERTY&#13;
ALLEVIATION (lUPA)&#13;
1.    China has an estimated population of 80 million at or below the poverty line (less&#13;
than Y 300 per year/person in 1993). Nearly all of them are rural poor, concentrated in&#13;
resource-deficient areas, and comprising entire communities located mostly in the upland&#13;
sections of the interior provinces of northern, northwestern (including Shaanxi) and&#13;
southwestern China. The 9FYP's strategy for poverty alleviation has the following&#13;
priorities: (a) integration of production, education, health, family planning and transport&#13;
programs into comprehensive local intervention packages; (b) expansion of the Food for&#13;
Work Program to cover the construction of terraced agricultural lands; and (c) increased&#13;
support for agricultural extension and training and farmers' marketing systems. Lack of&#13;
road access to an area increases transport costs so substantially that only high value-to&#13;
weight products will be profitable to market. Overall, 16.1 percent of poor county&#13;
townships lack road access, most others have such access available only in the dry&#13;
seasen.&#13;
2.    A threefold screening process was agreed: (a) an initial screening designed to&#13;
select into the pool of possible projects those that are located in "priority counties,"&#13;
counties whose composite ranking on selected demographic, economic and social criteria,&#13;
identifies them as most in need of "poverty alleviation" measures; (b) a second screening&#13;
focusing on the cost effectiveness of each roads improvement system per population&#13;
served; and (c) a detailed economic and social analysis of those RIPA systems that&#13;
successfully meet the criteria of the first two screening procedures.&#13;
First-Stage Screening&#13;
3.   Identification and Definition of Poor Counties. In 1986, the State Planning&#13;
Commission (SPC) designated all counties with annual per capita income of &lt; Y 150 as&#13;
poor counties. Thirty-four counties of Shaanxi were included in this category. In&#13;
addition, Shaanxi Provincial Government (SPG) designated another 35 counties where&#13;
the annual per capita income was Y 150-200 as poor counties. In 1993, SPG used the&#13;
following criteria for defining poor counties:&#13;
(a)   counties that received poverty alleviation funds from SPC and SPG during&#13;
1986-93, and in 1993, their per capita annual income was &lt; Y 600;&#13;
(b)   the 35 counties that were defined as poor by SPG in 1986 and in 1993, if&#13;
their income was &lt; Y 500; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                     ANNEX I&#13;
(c)   all other counties whose per capita annual income in 1993 was &lt; Y 400.&#13;
Accordingly, 50 counties were designated as poor by SPG. This was subsequently&#13;
approved by SPC in 1993. These 50 counties are the ones that were considered in the&#13;
initial screening for RIPA projects.&#13;
4.    Ranking and Selection of Poor Counties for RIPA. Rank ordering, based upon&#13;
socioeconomic and poverty criteria, was necessary to prioritize the geographic locations&#13;
of RIPA components. Shaanxi's countries were ranked according to a composite score&#13;
taking into account the following indicators:&#13;
(a)   Income Ranking. To assess the extent of poverty in the poor counties,&#13;
this ranking used average incomes as an indicator. Average per capita&#13;
income in 1993 varied from Y 200 to Y 500, and was allocated 5 points in&#13;
the ranking system. Counties with the lowest incomes were given the&#13;
highest ranking. The counties with per capita average incomes of Y 200-&#13;
260 were given 5 points, Y 261-320 with 4 points, Y 321-380 with 3&#13;
points, Y 381-440 with 2 points and Y 441-500 with only 1 point.&#13;
(b)   Poverty Ranking. This indicator is intended to identify the "very poor"&#13;
in each county (people with incomes of &lt; Y 300 in 1993). The indicator is&#13;
based on the actual number of "very poor" per 10,000 persons in the&#13;
county. The index varies from 1 to 36, and was allocated 5 points. The&#13;
counties with highest index were given the highest rank. The counties&#13;
with the index of 29-36 were given 5 points, index of 22-28 with 4 points,&#13;
index of 15-21 with 3 points, index of 8-14 with 2 points and index 1-7&#13;
with 1 point.&#13;
(c)   Value of Agricultural Production. As most of the poor are agriculture&#13;
and forestry dependent and are unskilled laborers, counties with larger&#13;
land areas in agriculture and forestry are ranked higher. Total land area in&#13;
agriculture and forestry (mu per km2 of county land) was used as a&#13;
surrogate index and was allocated 5 points. This varied from 1200 mu per&#13;
km2 to 8,800 mu per km2. When this index was in the highest range of&#13;
7,300-8,800, 5 points were allocated, 4 points for 5,800-7,299, 3 points for&#13;
4,300-5,799, 2 points for 2,800-4,299 and 1 point for 1,200-2,799.&#13;
(d)   Value of Mineral Production. Lack of access increases the transport cost&#13;
of mineral resources and hinders their exploitation; therefore, counties&#13;
with higher value of mineral production were ranked higher. This ranking&#13;
index was allocated 5 maximum points and varied from Y 12 to 132&#13;
million (1993 value). When the value of annual mineral production&#13;
reached Y 108.01-132.00 million, that county was given 5 points,&#13;
Y 84.01-108.00 million 4 points, Y 60.01-84.00 million 3 points, Y 36.01-&#13;
60.00 million 2 points and Y 12-36 million 1 point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                     ANNEX I&#13;
(e)   Social Development Indicators. Education and literacy, health care,&#13;
access to clean drinking water suffer when there is inadequate all-weather&#13;
access. Counties with the least social development by these measures&#13;
(based on 1993 data) were ranked the highest for RIPA. These indicators&#13;
were allocated 5 points as follows: (i) Population without clean drinking&#13;
water varied from 5 to 77 percent of total county population. When this&#13;
was 241 percent, that county was allocated 1 point. Other counties were&#13;
allocated zero points. (ii) The number of health workers per 10,000&#13;
persons was used as an indicator of access to health services and was&#13;
allocated 1 point. It varied from 12 to 40. Counties with lower access (&lt;&#13;
25 health workers per 10,000 persons) were given 1 point. All other&#13;
counties with higher degree of health access were given zero points.&#13;
(iii) Percent of people who cannot read or write (number of persons per&#13;
10,000 population) was used an educational indicator. This varied from&#13;
0.29 to 15.33. Counties with the higher illiteracy (&#142;7.7 persons per 10,000&#13;
population) were allocated 1 point. All other counties with higher literacy&#13;
were allocated zero points.  (iv) Food for Work Program  (FWP)&#13;
expenditures in each county varied from zero to Y 1.2 million per year.&#13;
They were used as a surrogate to unemployment and were allocated 2&#13;
points.  Counties in the bottom  one-third range of FWP annual&#13;
expenditures (&lt;Y 400,000) were given zero points, middle-third range&#13;
(Y 400,000-800,000) with 1 point and the top third range (&gt;Y 800,000)&#13;
given 2 points.&#13;
Selection of Prefectures for RIPA&#13;
5.    Based on the above ranking for all the 50 poor counties, the average range for&#13;
each of the 10 prefectures was then computed; the average ranking by prefectures varied&#13;
from 9.0 to 18.0:&#13;
(a)   Lantian county in Xian prefecture had the highest rating of 18.0. It was&#13;
decided not to include this county for RIPA as it is adjacent to Xian and&#13;
economic development of Xian will likely spill over into this county.&#13;
(b)   Weinan prefecture had the next highest average ranking of 15.5. Road&#13;
density (km of roads per km2) is quite high in Weinan now. It is also near&#13;
to Xian. Its high rating comes from its economic indexes (used in the&#13;
ranking system) rather than poverty conditions. Hence this prefecture was&#13;
not chosen for RIPA.&#13;
(c)   Lin You (Baoji City) prefecture had the lowest rating of 9.0 and therefore,&#13;
it was not included.&#13;
(d)   Xian Yang prefecture had a rating of 11.6, although the total population of&#13;
the very poor is very low. Its higher rating was derived mostly from its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
economic base rather than poverty conditions. It is also close to Xian. All&#13;
of its administrative villages are now fully accessible by all-weather roads.&#13;
Hence it was not selected for RIPA.&#13;
(e)   Tongchuan prefecture had a rating of 10.3 and it is mostly urban and&#13;
suburban in its settlement pattern. Population of the very poor is small&#13;
and the poor had a little better income than in the other prefectures. There&#13;
is also a major highway financed by the Bank in this prefecture. There are&#13;
more roads in this prefecture than elsewhere. Hence it was not chosen for&#13;
RIPA.&#13;
6.    The remaining five prefectures containing 34 counties were chosen for RIPA.&#13;
These are:&#13;
(a)   In Northern Shaanxi:&#13;
(i)    Yulin Prefecture.  Yulin prefecture has 12 counties and an&#13;
average ranking of 12.58. Although Yulin City county had a low&#13;
rating of 9.0, it is included in RIPA because all the systems should&#13;
connect to this administrative center. Wubao county is excluded&#13;
from RIPA because it has excellent water transport systems now.&#13;
All the other 11 counties are included in RIPA.&#13;
(ii)    Yanan Prefecture. There are eight counties in this prefecture&#13;
whose average rating was 9.50. Three counties below the average&#13;
rating were dropped from RIPA (Yencheng, Zhichang and&#13;
Yichuan) leavingfive counties in RIPA.&#13;
(b)   In Southern Shaanxi:&#13;
(i)    Hanzhong Prefecture. The average ranking for this prefecture&#13;
was 11.25. Zhengbai county had a ranking of 10.0 and it is&#13;
included because 59 percent of the villages do not currently have&#13;
any road access. Allfour counties are included in RIPA.&#13;
(ii)    Ankang Prefecture. Ankang has seven counties and had an&#13;
average ranking of 11.14. Only two counties had below the&#13;
average ranking: Baihe (8.0) and Zhengping (10.0). These two&#13;
counties are included because they do not have adequate access&#13;
now. Therefore, all seven counties are included in RIPA.&#13;
(iii)   Shanglo Prefecture. Shanglo prefecture had an average ranking of&#13;
13.28, the highest among the five prefectures chosen for RIPA. All&#13;
seven counties are included in RIPA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-                      ANNEX I&#13;
Second-Stage Screening of Poor Counties&#13;
7.   Identification of RIPA  Road Systems.  Based upon the proposed road&#13;
improvements (segments) in the Shaanxi Provincial Poverty Alleviation Plan, roads were&#13;
grouped into RIPA systems based upon: (a) continuity of the system; (b) maximization&#13;
of the population served, and (c) connectivity to as many settlements as possible. Using&#13;
the above criteria, 59 RIPA Road Systems were identified in 34 RIPA counties. The&#13;
estimated total cost of these 59 systems was Y 1. 03 billion.&#13;
8.    Screening of RIPA Initial Basket for Implementation. The System Cost Ratio&#13;
(SCR) or the cost of proposed improvements per population served in the influence area&#13;
of the systein (proposed investment divided by the population) was used to screen the&#13;
initial RIPA systems basket. The "influence area population" was defined as the total&#13;
population getting new access and better or improved access because of construction or&#13;
upgrading of new RIPA Systems. RIPA system costs varied from a very low&#13;
Y 90/person in the influence area to a high of Y 1,619/person served. This high range is&#13;
due to variations in the density of settlements and differences in topography.&#13;
9.    RIPA Implementation Basket. By applying the above rank ordering procedure&#13;
and deleting the very high cost systems, the basket of proposed RIPA Road Systems was&#13;
further reduced to 31 systems adding up to about 4,068 km in 25 counties with an&#13;
estimated cost of Y592 million.&#13;
10.  Initial Basket. For the first batch of systems to be implemented during the first&#13;
year of implementation of the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project, it was agreed&#13;
that a start will be made both in the northern and southern Shaanxi as follows:&#13;
(a)   Yulin Prefecture (system #4): 93 km (49 km of new construction and&#13;
44 km of rehabilitation to Class IV level) located in Fugou County within&#13;
the Loess Plateau in northeast Shaanxi. Total cost estimated at Y 14.7&#13;
million;&#13;
(b)   Yulin Prefecture (system #9): 82.6 km road upgrading to Class IV level.&#13;
Located in Shuide County adjacent to Shanxi Province. Total cost&#13;
estimated at Y 8.9 million;&#13;
(c)   Shanglo Prefecture (system #46): 42.8 km in adjoining mountainous&#13;
Zhashui and Zhenan Counties. Total cost estimated at Y 18.29 million;&#13;
(d)   Ankang Prefecture (system #36): 47.02 km of upgrading to Class IV&#13;
level road. Located in Langao County adjacent to Sichuan province.&#13;
Total cost estimated at Y 12. 88 million; and&#13;
(e)   Ankang Prefecture (system #41):  55 km for upgrading two road&#13;
segments of unclassified to Class IV level road. Located in Baihe County&#13;
adjacent to Hubei Province. Total cost estimated at Y 16.35 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
The above five RIPA systems were estimated to cost about Y 71.1 million.&#13;
Third-Stage Screening of RIPA System&#13;
11.   The third-stage screening consists of an analysis of the economic and social&#13;
benefits of each of the road systems included for consideration at the end of the second&#13;
screening. The following criteria will be used in this stage:&#13;
(a)   Analysis as Groups of Small Systems. The road segments will be&#13;
analyzed as groups of small systems rather than on a segment-by-segment&#13;
basis. RIPA roads need not be paved roads but must provide all-weather&#13;
access, and thus the proposed systems can include "unclassified&#13;
Nonmotorized Transport" (NMT), (e.g., bicycles, animal-drawn carts,&#13;
tractors, and jeeps) roads, "unclassified-under Class IV" all-weather&#13;
roads, and "classified roads-Class IV and Class III."&#13;
(b)  - Use of Motorization Data to Identify NMT Requirements. Data on the&#13;
number of motor vehicles (in different classifications such as cars, trucks,&#13;
motorcycles, tractors) in the counties to be connected by the proposed&#13;
RIPA systems is required for this analysis. This information should be&#13;
reviewed in the context of recent high growth of motorization in many&#13;
parts of China. The primary purpose of the review is to assure that the&#13;
type of road systems proposed (classified, motorized, nonmotorized ) fits&#13;
with the trends in the motor vehicle population and their use. Where there&#13;
are very few motor vehicles, NMT road connections should be carefully&#13;
considered.&#13;
(c)   Variations in Expected Minimum Economic Internal Rate of Return&#13;
(EIRR). This will depend upon the types of roads within the proposed&#13;
system. The system classification for analysis of EIRR will be based upon&#13;
the dominant class of road within the system. For example, if the&#13;
dominant part (&gt;50 percent of length in km) is unclassified, then the EIRR&#13;
expected will be that for unclassified roads (both new and rehabilitated).&#13;
If the dominant part of the system is Class IV, the expected EIRR will be&#13;
that for the Class IV roads (new, upgraded and rehabilitated).&#13;
12.   The expected EIRR will vary as follows:&#13;
(a)   Unclassified Roads: Expected Minimum EIRR of 8-10 percent.&#13;
(i)    All new roads for Nonmotorized Transport (bicycles and animal&#13;
carts) and farmers' vehicles (tractors and jeeps), which may not&#13;
necessarily be designed for trucks but primarily to provide access&#13;
to farmers and their local economic activities; and&#13;
(ii)    New and rehabilitated all-weather unclassified roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
The expected EIRR for primary access roads is lower than the other&#13;
classes of roads. Therefore, the EIRR, in this case, must be supported by&#13;
higher social benefits (population getting new access, population getting&#13;
better access and improvement in the social indicators included in the&#13;
county ranking system (outlined below).&#13;
(b)   Class IV Roads: Expected Minimum EIRR 10-12 percent&#13;
These roads include upgrading of unclassified roads to Class IV,&#13;
rehabilitation of existing Class IV roads, and any new Class IV roads. If&#13;
the EIRR is low, then social benefits (as discussed below) should be high.&#13;
(c)   Class III Roads: Expected Minimum EIRR 12 percent&#13;
These roads include new and rehabilitated Class III roads , and roads&#13;
upgraded from Class IV to Class III.&#13;
13.   Social benefits will be defined as increases in access to health (potable water),&#13;
educational services (reduced educational dropout rates and adult literacy) and improved&#13;
access to employment (reduced dependence on FWP expenditures). These rates will be&#13;
calculated by extrapolation with the existing situation in nearby comparator counties with&#13;
greater access to roads. The proportion of the total population getting new and better all-&#13;
weather access (through improved connectivity and reduction of travel time and cost) will&#13;
also stand as an indicator of social benefits. These social benefits will be calculated for&#13;
each RIPA system to be evaluated prior to its inclusion into an implementation package&#13;
for Bank approval.&#13;
14.   Population getting new all-weather access and population getting better access&#13;
(improved connectivity and reduction of travel time and cost) because of RIPA systems&#13;
will also be an indicator of social benefits. This will be calculated for each RIPA system.&#13;

ANNEX 2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR FEASIBILITY&#13;
STUDY OF XIAN BYPASS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Xian is one of the birthplaces of China's ancient civilizations. It was the capital&#13;
of 12 Chinese feudal dynasties (including Zhou, Qin, Han and Tang) and had an&#13;
important role in Chinese history and the political, economic and cultural development.&#13;
For centuries it was not only the most prosperous city of China and perhaps the largest in&#13;
the world, but also as the origin of the Silk Road from China to India and Europe, at the&#13;
center of economic and cultural trade between the eastern and western civilizations. This&#13;
long history has left Xian a wealth of cultural relics, and now the territory of Xian&#13;
resembles a huge underdeveloped historical site and museum.&#13;
2.    Since a group of invaluable cultural relics, including the Banpo Relics and the&#13;
Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses, Xian has been a popular national and international&#13;
tourist city, famed as one of the four ancient capitals of the world. The unique tourist&#13;
resources provide one of the economic advantages of Xian city: With exploitation and&#13;
preservation of cultural relics in Xian, its position as a world-famous historical city will&#13;
grow and its tourism will develop rapidly. Xian has the potential to become the major&#13;
historical tourist holy land in the Far East.&#13;
3.    Today, Xian is one of the largest cities of China. It is located at the border&#13;
between eastern and western China and has already become a key traffic hub. Two of the&#13;
recently designated national highways of China go through the city.  That from&#13;
Lianyungang port on China's east coast to Huorguesi at the west border is the principal&#13;
east-west highway artery, which is planned to be constructed before 2000. In addition,&#13;
Xian is also planned to become the largest highway transportation hub in western China.&#13;
4.    Through more than 40 years of construction and development, Xian has become&#13;
the principal center of politics, economics, culture, science and technology and&#13;
infornation in northwest of China. At the same time, it has also become the largest&#13;
commercial and trade center in northwest China. However, in road construction Xian&#13;
falls far behind its development in other areas. In recognition of its pivotal status in the&#13;
national transportation network, and of the impact of the volume of through traffic on the&#13;
environment of the historic city center, early in 1985 the first study for a Xian Bypass&#13;
scheme was started. Since then the city has continued to expand, but its highway&#13;
development has failed to keep pace. Already, city development has extended far beyond&#13;
the proposed the city's Second Ring Road, while the ring road itself is still not finished.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105-                       ANNEX2&#13;
5.    The city lacks even one through expressway and transiting vehicles still have to&#13;
go through the city along the urban roads designed and built for nonmotorized transport,&#13;
firther aggravating the rapidly growing problem of urban traffic congestion. Since the&#13;
Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-90), several high-grade highways, such as the Xian-&#13;
Lintong expressway, the Xian-Tongchuan Class I highway, the Xian-Baoji expressway,&#13;
etc., have been completed; so that vehicles can be easily and rapidly collected from or&#13;
distributed to the area outside the city center. But, it is very difficult for vehicles to go&#13;
through or enter and exit through the other side.&#13;
6.    Today, the problems of traffic in the downtown are very serious. The capacity of&#13;
urban roads is low, impeded by frequent intersections; traffic jams and accidents occur&#13;
with high frequency; and there are increasing conflicts between pedestrians,&#13;
nonmotorized and motorized transport. The average speed of vehicles on urban roads is&#13;
less than 20 km/hr and decreasing rapidly and vehicle emissions are creating problems for&#13;
pedestrians, cyclists and residents. Even the fabric of the historic city walls is being&#13;
destroyed by the impact of vehicle-induced pollution. The problems arising from this&#13;
chronic traffic situation have become the main constraints on regional socioeconomic&#13;
development.&#13;
7.    For many years the vehicle fleet of Xian city has been increasing at an annual rate&#13;
of more than 10 percent, and the taxi fleet has been growing even faster. Unless remedial&#13;
measures are taken to address the city's transport problems and to mitigate the rapid&#13;
motorization, the environment and cultural relics in downtown Xian city will be seriously&#13;
affected.&#13;
8.    In order to allow the social development of the city, reduce traffic congestion and&#13;
improve the environmental quality of the city, it is planned to construct a further ring&#13;
road as well as complete the second ring road, the latter by the end of 1997. Although&#13;
this will reduce traffic congestion for a time, the construction of a bypass to take through&#13;
traffic out of the city center will also be needed.&#13;
9.    Study of the possible location and alignrnent of the Xian Bypass has now been&#13;
going on for 10 years. After much investigation, research and discussion involving&#13;
collection of data on social, economic, traffic and engineering conditions of Xian city, the&#13;
following reports have been produced:&#13;
(a)   Report of the Trunk National Highways I (Shaanxi Province);&#13;
(b)   Alignment Schemes Statement of Xian Bypass-A Section of a Trunk&#13;
National Highway (Prefeasibility Study Report of a Xian Bypass);&#13;
(c)   Feasibility Study Report of Xian Bypass;&#13;
(d)   Supplementary Feasibility Study Report of the Section from Youjiazhuang&#13;
to Guanting of Xian Bypass Study;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106-                      ANNEX2&#13;
(e)   Report on Alignment Scheme of Xian Bypass and North Section of Ring&#13;
Road 2 and Viaduct Scheme; and&#13;
(f)   Study Report on Alignment Adjustment of Xian Bypass Investigation and&#13;
Study Report on Viaduct Scheme of Xian Bypass-Preliminary Design of&#13;
the section from Youjiazhuang to Guanting of Xian bypass.&#13;
10.  In the course of these studies, governors of the provincial government, city&#13;
government and the Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department (SPTD) have devoted&#13;
many resources of time and money in arranging conferences, in which many leaders of&#13;
relevant provincial and city departments and experts participated. Furthermore, experts&#13;
from the China International Engineering Consultant Corporation (CIECC), the Ministry&#13;
of Communications (MOC) and the MOC Highway Planning and Design Institute have&#13;
reviewed the project reports. Evaluation, in all its senses, and choice of an alignment of&#13;
the Xian Bypass is the focus of this additional study.&#13;
11.   Xian lies at the center of the Guanzhong Plain, which extends from Henan&#13;
Province in the east to Gansu Province in the west. The satellite cities, Xianyang and&#13;
Lintong, are both to the north of the city. Eastbound and westbound traffic makes up the&#13;
majority of transit traffic. So, based on the principle that as a major section of a trunk&#13;
national highway through a large city, the alignment of Xian Bypass should be short,&#13;
economical and convenient to link the Xian-Lintong expressway, the Xian-Tongchuan&#13;
Class I highway and the Xian-Baoji expressway, forming a high grade highway network&#13;
with its center at Xian. It is accepted that the alignment of the Xian Bypass should pass&#13;
to the north of the city. After many years of study on the alignment of the Xian Bypass,&#13;
three alternative alignment concepts have emerged:&#13;
(a)   Scheme 1: Near-to-Downtown Concept (also known as the Viaduct&#13;
Scheme). The alignment of this route would be short and close to the city&#13;
center, and able to attract more traffic than the other possible routes. But&#13;
because it is very close to the downtown area, the damage to the city&#13;
environment would be serious and the land acquisition construction costs&#13;
would be very high.&#13;
(b)   Scheme 2: Extension of the Eastern Bypass Concept (of Han Dynasty).&#13;
The alignment of this concept would be further to the north of the city&#13;
center, able to attract both east-west through traffic and much traffic&#13;
destined for the center as well. Furthermore, it would conveniently link&#13;
the existing high-grade highways in three directions-east, north and west.&#13;
But the west section of the scheme would inevitably pass through the&#13;
ancient Changan City (of the Han Dynasty), an area of preservation by the&#13;
State. Although the eastern half of the route (from Youjiazhuang to&#13;
Guanting) has been approved by the State Planning Committee (SPC),&#13;
agreement on the western half has still to be reached. Because the&#13;
western section goes through a site of important cultural relics, it has to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
studied and reviewed and agreed by the State Cultural Relics Preservation&#13;
Authorities. If the answer from the state cultural relics preservation&#13;
authorities is negative, this scheme will not be considered further.&#13;
(c)   Scheme 3: North of the Changan City Relic, close to the Wei River&#13;
Concept. This route could avoid the above relic preservation and city&#13;
environmental problems, and could attract most of the east-west transit&#13;
traffic from the city. However, it is too far away from the city center to&#13;
attract the inbound and outbound traffic, and would therefore have a&#13;
smaller impact on relieving traffic congestion in the center than the other&#13;
concepts..&#13;
12.   MOC, SPTD and the World Bank have agreed that a Xian Bypass would be a very&#13;
important section of the whole trunk national highway from Lianyungang port to&#13;
Huorguesi, and its construction is important for the social and economic development of&#13;
Xian city. However, there has not yet been a comparative study of the engineering,&#13;
economic, financial, environmental and historic consequences of the alternative route&#13;
concepts. Consequently, it was agreed that such a study would be included in the World&#13;
Bank-financed Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project&#13;
13.   These Terms of Reference have been prepared by the Shaanxi Provincial Highway&#13;
Survey and Design Institute (SPHSDI) and agreed with MOC and the World Bank.&#13;
Study Organization&#13;
14.   Because of the importance of the Xian Bypass and the complexity of the issues&#13;
involved, and in order that the study work can proceed successfully and reach a&#13;
conclusion within a reasonable time, a Leading Group will be formed, comprising&#13;
representatives of the interested parties of the Provincial and Municipal governments. Its&#13;
task will be to guide, coordinate, check and review the work of the Study Team. Under&#13;
the leading group, the Study Team will comprise engineers, economists and technicians,&#13;
mainly from SPHSDI and relevant research units. The Study Team's task will be to&#13;
undertake the technical work of the study, under the direction of the Leading Group.&#13;
Appendix 1 presents the detailed organization structure of the Leading Group and the&#13;
Study Team as well as the allocation of study team members to study tasks and the&#13;
related person-months.&#13;
International and National Experts&#13;
15.   Because of the complexity of the Xian Bypass Study, international and national&#13;
experts will be contracted to give technical guidance to the study, maintain the excellence&#13;
of the analyses and review the draft reports of the Study Team, and to make suggestions&#13;
for modifications or additions to them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108-                        ANNEX2&#13;
16.   Three international experts will be needed in the following areas:&#13;
(a)   City planning and transport development;&#13;
(b)   Traffic environment impact, with special experience in archeology and&#13;
cultural relics; and&#13;
(c)   Traffic engineering and highway design.&#13;
The first expert (city planning and transport development) will visit Xian for 15-20 days&#13;
before the Inception Report, Traffic Report and draft Final Report are prepared; the&#13;
second and third experts should arrive in Xian 20 days before the Traffic Report and draft&#13;
Final Reports are prepared. Each visit to Xian will require 10 days time, including three&#13;
days' report reading time in their country before traveling.  Travel time will be&#13;
considered as four days, so the average paid days per trip will be 14.  The total&#13;
international experts' time will be equal to about 4.5 person-months. Appendix 2&#13;
presents the terms of reference for the international experts.&#13;
17.   SPHSDI will directly contract the three experts, following World Bank guidelines&#13;
and from a short list of consultants for each position agreed with the Bank&#13;
18.   A team of 13 experienced national experts will also be established to provide&#13;
advice as requested by the study team and review the three reports. Experts with the&#13;
following specializations will form the team:&#13;
(a)   Highway Planning                 (2 persons)&#13;
(b)   Highway design                   (4 persons)&#13;
(c)   City planning and city traffic  (3 persons)&#13;
(d)   Traffic enviromnental impact     (2 persons)&#13;
(e)   Archeology and cultural relics  (2 persons)&#13;
19.   All the national experts shall arrive in Xian about 15 days before each report&#13;
(Inception, Traffic and draft Final Report) are prepared and will stay in Xian about 7 days&#13;
each time. The total input will be about 12 person-months.&#13;

traffic and through traffic.  Traffic volumes in city area will be&#13;
investigated by a home interview survey method.&#13;
(c)   Analyze development trend of inbound, outbound and through traffic, and&#13;
forecast them for the plan years, taking account of the economic and social&#13;
development plan, Xian city general plan, city land use plan and city road&#13;
network plan, and considering projections of population, land use,&#13;
employment distribution and traffic diverted to/from the railway and air&#13;
transport.&#13;
(d)   The base year of traffic forecast is 1996, the plan years will be 2000, 2005,&#13;
2010 and 2020, with medium and low forecasts being made for each year.&#13;
(e)   Using demand matrices compiled from demand forecasts, a standard&#13;
allocation model of demand to modes and routes, forecast future highway&#13;
demand for each link of the network (without Xian bypass). Repeat the&#13;
assignment for each alternative route concept, taking account of the trip&#13;
generation or suppression characteristics of each of them. The road&#13;
network for each alternative should include the proposed alignment of the&#13;
bypass, modifications or additions to connecting roads and interchanges.&#13;
Traffic data collection will be undertaken by SPHSDI and XCPDI. The analysis&#13;
of traffic data as well as traffic projections will be carried out by MOC's Highway&#13;
Planning and Design Institute (MHPDI) and China City Plan and Design Institute&#13;
(CCPDI).&#13;
25.   Interchanges and Connecting Roads.&#13;
(a)   Recommend on the basis of traffic analyses, including turning movement&#13;
projections, reasonable locations as well as scale and types of interchanges&#13;
between the alternative alignments for Xian bypass and connecting roads.&#13;
(b)   Analyze construction scale of connecting roads (done by SPHSDI and&#13;
XCPDI) and estimate the costs and optimum timing of their construction.&#13;
26.   Culture Relics Impact Analysis.&#13;
(a)   Investigate the distribution of culture relics along each alignment and their&#13;
required level of protection, draw a map with large scale for each&#13;
important site to show the possible route alignment.  Recommend&#13;
additional remedial measures to protect cultural sites along each route&#13;
alignment and estimate the cost of their implementation. The views of&#13;
archeologists from the concerned agencies would be solicited. This work&#13;
will be undertaken by the Shaanxi Archeology Research Institute (SARI).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

27.   Environment Impact Evaluation (EIE).&#13;
(a)   Undertake an  EIE for each alignment alternative and complete an&#13;
environmental monitoring of sensitive spots along each alternative route.&#13;
Also, recommend measures to reduce the environmental impact of each&#13;
route and estimate the costs of their implementation (by Shaanxi&#13;
Environment Protection Research Institute (SEPRI).&#13;
28.   Land Acquisition and Resettlement.&#13;
(a)   Investigate quantities and cost of land acquisition and resettlement, and&#13;
also determine resettlement policies and the costs of their implementation&#13;
(done by SPHSDI).&#13;
29.   Engineering Cost Estimate and Financing Plan.&#13;
(a)   Estimate the construction cost of each alternative alignment, based on&#13;
feasibility study estimates of quantities and June 1996 prices, and include&#13;
cost of connecting roads.&#13;
(b)   Prepare a financing plan for each alternative, taking account of the&#13;
financial capacity of the city and provincial govermnents, and all other&#13;
sources of finance, including private and/or loan finance of some project&#13;
components if appropriate and necessary. (To be undertaken by SPHSDI.)&#13;
30.   National Economy Evaluation and Financial Analysis.&#13;
(a)   General economic evaluation shall be done for each alignment alternative&#13;
and detailed evaluation shall be done for the recommended alternative&#13;
under conditions of low and medium traffic growth and with and without&#13;
tolls.&#13;
(b)   Economy evaluation shall follow the method and parameters for project&#13;
economic evaluation issued by MOC, the main indices shall include EIRR,&#13;
ENPV, EBCR and the first-year rate of return.&#13;
(c)   Undertake sensitivity analysis with respect to construction costs, traffic&#13;
levels and other parameters as considered appropriate.&#13;
(d)   Undertake financial and loan repayment capacity analysis. This will&#13;
require a review of the toll revenue that might be expected from the&#13;
bypass, and should take account of the elasticity of demand for the bypass,&#13;
bearing in mind that alternative non-tolled roads will be available for local&#13;
traffic that would use the bypass if there were not to be a toll.&#13;
(e)   The feasibility study for Xian bypass shall follow the preparation method&#13;
for highway project feasibility study report issued by MOC and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Selection of Recommended Alternative&#13;
31.   Alignment Alternatives.&#13;
(a)   At least, three feasible and significantly different alignment alternatives&#13;
shall be proposed to be investigated and compared from an engineering&#13;
feasibility, economic and financial feasibility, environmental and impact&#13;
on cultural relics point of view.&#13;
(b)   The views of provincial, city and local governments, residents, and&#13;
technical experts on these alternatives shall be sought.&#13;
(c)   A comparative evaluation of the alternatives will be made, using a&#13;
consistent and comprehensive framework and using the same level of&#13;
analysis and optimization of each alternative. The most appropriate&#13;
alternative will be recommended, with an indication of why it is&#13;
considered preferable to those rejected. (SPHSDI will be in charge of the&#13;
above work.)&#13;
32.   This recommendation, together with the supporting arguments and information,&#13;
will be presented to the national and international experts for their opinions. These&#13;
opinions will be presented together with the recommendation to the Leading Group. The&#13;
Leading Group will consider the recommendation and accept or reject it. The decision of&#13;
the Leading Group will be communicated to MOC, MOF and the World Bank, together&#13;
with an explanation in the case of a rejection.&#13;
33.   The construction scale, technical standard and a reasonable schedule for&#13;
construction of the Xian bypass will be determined, once a decision on the route location&#13;
has been made and agreed (including the optimum opening year and whether staged&#13;
construction should be applied).&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Shaanxi Provincial Government, through the Shaanxi Provincial Highway&#13;
Survey and Design Institute (SPHSDI) is about to commence a study of alternative&#13;
locations for a bypass to the city of Xian, one of the most important cities in the social&#13;
and cultural history of China. In addition to staff of SPHSDI, the Study Team will&#13;
include representatives of the Xian City Planning, Design and Research Institute, the&#13;
Shaanxi Provincial Archeology Research Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial&#13;
Environmental Institute. The Study will be under the direction of the Leading Group, led&#13;
by a representative of the Provincial Governor.&#13;
2.   It is proposed to contract three international experts to advise on particular aspects&#13;
of the study methodology and to review the relevant portions of the three draft reports to&#13;
be produced by the Study team. The foreign costs of the study, including all costs of&#13;
international experts whether incurred inside or outside China, will be financed from the&#13;
proceeds of the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project, expected to be presented to&#13;
the Board of the World Bank in March 1996.&#13;
3.    The Terms of Reference for the Study are attached to these terms of reference for&#13;
the three international experts. Each of the three experts should have a minimum of 15&#13;
years' professional experience and to be familiar with the transport sector in China,&#13;
particularly urban highway development, from the point of view of their own area of&#13;
expertise.&#13;
Experience Required&#13;
4.    The first expert should have expertise in the relationship between transport&#13;
development and city planning. He/she should have a postgraduate or professional&#13;
qualification in city planning or urban development, as well as in transport or civil&#13;
engineering with a specialty in transport or traffic. It is expected that the person selected&#13;
will have worked on transport development projects in historic cities, preferably in&#13;
developing countries. It would be an added advantage if the expert has experience in&#13;
transport studies in China and/or other Asian countries, and be familiar with the&#13;
institutional environment within which highway projects are prepared and evaluated in&#13;
these countries.&#13;
5.    The second expert should have experience in the environmental impact of traffic&#13;
in urban areas, with a knowledge of the specific impacts of noise and air pollution on&#13;
residents, pedestrians, nonmotorized transport and historic buildings.  Given the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -         Appendix 2 to ANNEX 2&#13;
importance of preservation of archeological and cultural relics in determining the route of&#13;
the bypass, this expert should have particular experience in measures to protect sites of&#13;
archeological and cultural importance in the planning of urban highways or other major&#13;
infrastructure projects. He/she should have a postgraduate qualification in environmental&#13;
science and in transport planning (or with transport as a major component of the&#13;
environmental science qualification). It would be an added advantage if the expert&#13;
selected is familiar with the environmental regulatory framework in China and/or with the&#13;
institutional requirements for a project's final environmental approval. He/she will have&#13;
worked on a number of urban infrastructure development projects in historic cities,&#13;
preferably in China or other Southeast Asian countries.&#13;
6.    The final expert will have a professional or postgraduate qualification in traffic&#13;
engineering and highway design, with a specialty in urban transport. He/she will have a&#13;
wide experience in the transport and traffic aspects of urban highway development,&#13;
particularly in respect of intersection and interchange design and location, the interaction&#13;
between motorized and nonmotorized road users, and the distribution of traffic from&#13;
urban highways through the urban areas to their final destinations. It would be an added&#13;
advantage if the expert has experience in similar studies in Chinese or Southeast Asian&#13;
cities where rapid motorization has been an issue and where integration of urban&#13;
highways into the built environment has been successfully managed.&#13;
Responsibilities and Outputs&#13;
7.    All three experts will be required to provide specialist advice within their area of&#13;
expertise as requested by the Shaanxi Government, always within the time limits of their&#13;

ANNEX 3: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR HIGHWAY&#13;
MAINTENANCE STUDY&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Shaanxi is an inland province in middle-west China. In 1994, it had a population&#13;
of about 34.8 million and an area of about 206,000 square kilometers. Transport is&#13;
predominantly by road and rail. In 1994, road transport accounted for about 87 percent of&#13;
the tons and 18 percent of the ton-kilometers, as well as 87 percent of the passengers and&#13;
32 percent of the passenger-kilometers. Road transport has been increasing at an annual&#13;
rate of 12 percent and is expected to increase by about 10 percent annually over the next&#13;
decade.&#13;
2.    The present highway network consists of about 39,000 km, of which about&#13;
8,800 km are national and provincial roads maintained by the Shaanxi Highway&#13;
Administration Bureau (SHAB). About 72 percent of the highway network is paved, and&#13;
only 4 percent are classified as Class II highway (2-lane roads) or higher standard.&#13;
Generally, roads are reasonably well maintained. In 1993, only about 20 percent of the&#13;
roads were considered to be in fair or bad condition. However, maintenance is labor-&#13;
intensive and not much equipment is used, with the result that the quality of the riding&#13;
surface is rough, which adversely affects the vehicle operating costs.&#13;
3.   In Shaanxi, highway maintenance is under the control of the High-Grade Highway&#13;
Administration Bureau (SHGHAB) and SHAB. SHGHAB is responsible for the high-&#13;
grade highways in the Province; the total length of which is about 174 km. Presently five&#13;
maintenance stations maintain these roads. SHAB is in charge of the maintenance of the&#13;
trunk highway system (about 9,700 km) and exercises its control of this network through&#13;
10 prefectural highway districts, which are in turn in charge of 112 county-level highway&#13;
districts. As for the maintenance of the county and township roads, this is done through&#13;
10 local highway maintenance sections (one for each prefecture) and 103 maintenance&#13;
stations at the county level. In total there are 903 maintenance squads and about 30,000&#13;
people are involved in highway maintenance, or about 1 person/km, which is high in&#13;
comparison with developed countries.&#13;
4.    The condition of the roads is determined monthly by routine checks of the county&#13;
districts, and is checked quarterly by the central districts. SHAB inspects the condition of&#13;
the roads on sample basis once every six months. No scientific measurements are used in&#13;
determining the condition of the maintenance of roads. Consequently, this system tends&#13;
to overinflate the percentage of roads in good condition. The data on traffic volumes on&#13;
roads is collected through 3 continuous counting stations, 159 periodic stations (where&#13;
traffic volumes are collected for three days each month) and 659 general survey stations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-122-                      ANNEX3&#13;
(where traffic is counted for two days each year). These stations cover only 72 percent of&#13;
the total highway network. Data transfer and analysis is done manually, which requires a&#13;
long time and results in errors. Consequently, traffic volume data is not adequately taken&#13;
into consideration in determining the conditions of roads.&#13;
5.    The Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department (SPTD), under the guidance of&#13;
MOC, started developing a modem road data bank (RDB) and pavement management&#13;
system (PMS). A prefectural-level RDB has been successfully completed and will be&#13;
implemented in 5 of the 10 prefectures in Shaanxi by the end of 1996. SPTD wants to&#13;
develop a provincial-level RDB. However, these systems have not yet been used as&#13;
effective tools in better management of highway maintenance.&#13;
6.    SPTD is aware of the problems facing highway maintenance in Shaanxi Province.&#13;
SPTD considers the productivity of the existing highway maintenance to be rather low&#13;
and the quality of maintenance to require substantial improvement. Consequently, it&#13;
intends to undertake a four-part Highway Maintenance Study to lay the foundations for&#13;
better use of existing resources (financial, human and management, equipment and&#13;
materials) to achieve a higher quality of more efficient and less costly maintenance of&#13;
highways in Shaanxi.&#13;
7.    The first part of the study is centered on improved ways of conducting&#13;
maintenance primarily through introduction of. the market mechanism in highway&#13;
maintenance operations. The second part is concentrated on introduction of more&#13;
mechanization of highway maintenance operations to improve quality and increase&#13;
productivity. The third part of the study is focused on collection of traffic volume data&#13;
(motorized and nonmotorized traffic) so as to reduce the time required for collection and&#13;
analysis of data, increase accuracy of the collected data, and provide on a more timely&#13;
basis the needed traffic volume data that is required for planning, investment decisions,&#13;
and maintenance purposes.  The fourth part of the study is directed toward the&#13;
development of the provincial-level RDB.&#13;
Objectives of the Study&#13;
8.    The objectives of the study are to increase the productivity and the quality of&#13;
maintenance operations and to help SPTD properly prepare itself for the orderly&#13;
introduction of the market mechanism in its maintenance operations. To achieve these&#13;
objectives, the study will focus on the following four main aspects of highway&#13;
maintenance:  (a) introduction of the market mechanism in highway maintenance,&#13;
primarily through maintenance by contract; (b) increased mechanization of maintenance&#13;
operations to improve the quality and efficiency of maintenance operations; (c) improved&#13;
methods of collecting and analyzing traffic (motorized and nonmotorized) volume data;&#13;
and (d) development of a provincial-level Road Data Bank.&#13;

Main Study Activities&#13;
9.    The main activities require to carry out the above-mentioned four aspects of&#13;
highway maintenance to include, but are not necessarily limited to the following&#13;
activities.&#13;
10.   Organization of Highway Maintenance&#13;
(a)   Conduct a comprehensive review of SPTD's operations and organizational&#13;
structure, and identify the activities/functions, in the organization,&#13;
operations and management of its road and highway network (with&#13;
emphasis on maintenance), which are suited for commercial operations.&#13;
This may refer to the organization equipment and technical capabilities,&#13;
staffing and funding to carry out the operations and management of these&#13;
functions.&#13;
(b)   Analyze each of the above functions in terms of current performance, and&#13;
propose alternatives, which specify the organizational, technical and&#13;
fnancial implications.&#13;
(c)   Analyze the implications of the above on the role of SPTD in highway&#13;
operations with emphasis on highway maintenance. This may entail that&#13;
SPTD would play less the role of an implementing agency and more of a&#13;
regulatory and supervisory entity. Special attention should be given to the&#13;
question of surplus labor resulting from shifts in the role of the SPTD.&#13;
(d)   Estimate the implications of the changing role of SPTD  on its&#13;
organizational structure, management, labor force and skills mix, and&#13;
associated training and institutional capacity requirements.  Special&#13;
attention should be paid to the transitional arrangements required.&#13;
(e)   Consider the legal and institutional implications of the above, taking into&#13;
account the central and provincial policy, regulatory, financial and&#13;
enforcement frameworks.&#13;
(f)   On the basis of the above, the study should make some preliminary&#13;
recommendations regarding future courses of action by SPTD (both in the&#13;
transitional period and in the long-term), with special emphasis on&#13;
highway maintenance.  Also, the results of the study should be&#13;
documented in a final report.&#13;
11.   Mechanization of Highway Maintenance Operations   -&#13;
(a)   Review the existing methods of highway maintenance and identify the&#13;
operations which are suitable for introduction of machinery. Pertinent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124-                     ANNEX3&#13;
information and experience of foreign countries, especially the developed&#13;
ones, would be very useful in this regard.&#13;
(b)   Identify the types and main specifications of equipment that are best suited&#13;
to the various maintenance operations, taking into consideration the&#13;
existing levels of mechanization, cost of new machines versus availability&#13;
of funds, and skills of existing labor as well as the required training to&#13;
properly operate and maintain these equipment.&#13;
(c)   Identify the main materials, as well as their quantities and geographic&#13;
distribution, required to properly operate and maintain the higher levels of&#13;
mechanization of maintenance operations.  These include fuel, oil,&#13;
lubricants, and spare parts. Also, estimate the requirements for building&#13;
structures to house these equipment, stores for materials and spare parts, as&#13;
well as garages for maintenance of these equipment.&#13;
(d)   Investigate the required instruments required to ensure proper quality&#13;
control in maintenance operations, including laboratories and their staffing&#13;
and related training of staff.&#13;
(e)   Study various ways for organization and deployment of the machines for&#13;
highway maintenance. This should be related to the overall organization&#13;
of highway maintenance, introduction of the market mechanism into&#13;
highway maintenance as well as to the main types of maintenance&#13;
operations (routine, periodic, rehabilitation), and size of existing and&#13;
future maintenance operations as well as their geographic distribution.&#13;
(f)   Assess the impact of higher mechanization on the number and skills of&#13;
existing labor involved in highway maintenance, training required to&#13;
properly operate and maintain the new machinery, and propose realistic&#13;
means of dealing with excess labor taking pertinent current laws and&#13;
practices into consideration.&#13;
(g)   Assess the financial implications of the various levels of mechanization of&#13;
highway maintenance operations on the overall budgets for highway&#13;
maintenance. At present, most of the financial resources are used for&#13;
salaries of maintenance labor and management.&#13;
(h)   On the basis of the above, propose a realistic and appropriate higher level&#13;
of mechanization for highway maintenance in Shaanxi and outline a time-&#13;
phased plan of action for gradual and orderly introduction of&#13;
mechanization in highway maintenance. This plan must be relatively easy&#13;
to carry out and can be used in other provinces in China. It should also&#13;
recognize that levels of mechanization increase over time and as the&#13;
economy of a province develops.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-125 -                      ANNEX3&#13;
(i)   Prepare a final report that documents the results of this study.&#13;
12.   Improved Collection and Analysis of Traffic Volume Data&#13;
(a)   Review  existing methods of collection of traffic (motorized and&#13;
nonmotorized) volume data and their analyses.&#13;
(b)   Review existing number and geographic distribution of equipment for&#13;
collection of traffic volume data and relate these to the functional and&#13;
administrative classes of highways.&#13;
(c)   Based on the above two activities, identify the problems with the existing&#13;
system of collection and analysis of traffic volume data and the speed with&#13;
which these data are made available to the highway maintenance agencies.&#13;
(d)   Determine an overall system for collection of traffic volume data in&#13;
Shaanxi Province including number and location of continuous traffic&#13;
counting stations and periodic counting stations (including definition of&#13;
the period-quarterly, monthly, and for how many days each time). This&#13;
system should be capable of identifying types of motor vehicles and&#13;
nonmotorized traffic. Criteria for the establishment of each type of traffic&#13;
counting station should be established. This should help in deciding&#13;
location and number and type of stations to be added in the future. The&#13;
system for traffic volume data should be related to the Road Data Bank&#13;
being developed in Shaanxi Province.&#13;
(e)   Based on experience in other provinces in China as well as in other&#13;
countries, identify the type of equipment best suited for collection of&#13;
traffic volume data. A comparison of these equipment should help define&#13;
the equipment best suited for Shaanxi.&#13;
(f)    Estimate the number of equipment by type needed as well as their costs in&#13;
both foreign and local currencies and develop a time-phased action plan&#13;
for acquisition and deployment of these equipment.&#13;
(g)   Review the various methods for transmission of traffic volume data from&#13;
the collection sites to the place(s) where data will be processed and/or&#13;
analyzed, and determine the methods best suited for Shaanxi's conditions.&#13;
(h)   Develop a system  for analysis of traffic volume data including its&#13;
hardware and software requirements. Maximum use should be made of&#13;
existing software and the emphasis should be on adapting the available&#13;
software to Shaanxi conditions rather than developing new software. The&#13;
software should: (i) have adequate statistical analytical capability of&#13;
traffic flows; (ii) provide for correction of traffic flows to reflect hourly,&#13;
daily, and monthly changes in traffic flows; (iii) help produce trend and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126-                       ANNEX3&#13;
features of sectional traffic flows; (iv) analyze traffic volumes by axle&#13;
loads; and (v) analyze traffic volume to capacity relationships.&#13;
(i)    Determine the specific agency/units within SPTD  that should be&#13;
responsible for maintenance of the traffic volume equipment, the&#13;
collection and transmission of data, and the analysis of data and provision&#13;
of reports to other units/agencies within SPTD. Also, realistic time&#13;
schedules should be developed for the step-by-step and orderly flow of&#13;
information from the traffic volume measurement sites to reports on traffic&#13;
volumes to the various units/agencies in SPTD. The related manpower&#13;
requirements, as well as training needs, should be estimated.&#13;
(j)    Estimate the capital cost of the equipment for collection of traffic volume&#13;
data and of the hardware and software for analysis, training costs, as well&#13;
as the annual cost of running the system.&#13;
(k)   Document the results of this study in a final report.&#13;
13.   Provincial Level Road Data Bank&#13;
(a)   SPTD is recognized as one of the leaders in China in the development of&#13;
RDB. It has already developed a prefectural-level system (in Baoji) and&#13;
will complete its implementation in 5 of its 10 prefectures by the end of&#13;
1996. The proposed provincial-level RDB serves as the intermediate line&#13;
between the prefectural-level RDB and the MOC-level RDB. Hence, it&#13;
has to be developed within the overall framework set by MOC. Moreover,&#13;
it could form the basis for the system to be adopted by MOC for use in all&#13;
provinces in China.&#13;
(b)   Determine the functions of the provincial level RDB. Tentatively these&#13;
are to:&#13;
(i)   provide most up-to-date and accurate information for highway&#13;
planning, design, maintenance and management;&#13;
(ii)   provide reports and maps and to exchange information with other&#13;
concerned departments and provide information services for the&#13;
public;&#13;
(iii)   allow the user to add (after authorization) limited function and&#13;
attribute data;&#13;
(iv)    establish client/server network with the prefectural-level RDB;&#13;
(v)    use multiple-media technology to provide graphics, images and&#13;
data to users;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-127-                       ANNEX3&#13;
(vi)   allow dynamic queries, segmentation and linear overlay; and&#13;
(vii)   interface with the Chinese Pavement Management System (CPMS)&#13;
to process highway network maintenance analyses.&#13;
(c)   Determine the appropriate scope of the data including range of data&#13;
collection, geographic information that is consistent with the desired level&#13;
of coverage and depth of investigation.&#13;
(d)   Develop and implement an open data base system that would give the user&#13;
more flexibility to modify and add data items or to add new functions to&#13;
meet the needs of highway management.&#13;
(e)   Develop a client/server architecture that allows more flexibility and&#13;
expansion possibilities in the future. This architecture is more economical&#13;
and practical than other systems.&#13;
(f)    Develop a system that can process special geographic features and output&#13;
highway theme maps (GIS) that meet the growing needs of highway&#13;
management.&#13;
(g)   Using research on road broken chainage dynamic processing technique,&#13;
solve the problems of data processing due to changes in mileposts caused&#13;
by reconstruction of highways and their spatial graphic processing.&#13;
(h)   Document the results of the study in a final report.&#13;
Study Organization and Staffing&#13;
14.   Because of the importance of the study and the complexity of the issues involved,&#13;
and in order that the study can proceed successfully and reach realistic conclusions, a&#13;
Leading Group will be formed, comprising representatives of SPTD, Provincial Labor&#13;
Department, Provincial Machinery Department and MOC. Its task would be to guide,&#13;
coordinate, check and review the work of the Study Teams. Four Study Teams, one for&#13;
each of the four aspects of the study, will be formed. These teams will include engineers,&#13;
organization and labor specialists, computer specialists, economists and technicians&#13;
mainly from SPTD. SPTD would, as needed, utilize Chinese experts from other&#13;
organizations in Shaanxi and other provinces in China. Also, international experts would&#13;
be utilized to give technical guidance to the study teams, maintain the excellence of the&#13;
analyses and review the draft reports of the study teams and make suggestions for&#13;
modifications or additions to them.&#13;
15.   Four international experts would be needed for a total of about 8.5 person-months&#13;
in the following areas:&#13;
&#13;

(a)   One highway organization and maintenance expert with a minimum of 15&#13;
years of experience in the field of organization and management with&#13;
emphasis on key issues of institutional arrangements in highway&#13;
departments, especially maintenance operations. The services of this&#13;
expert will be required for 1.5 months for the study of introduction of the&#13;
market mechanism in highway maintenance and for general assistance to&#13;
the other three studies, especially the study of mechanization of highway&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
(b)   One labor economist/specialist with a minimum of 15 years experience in&#13;
the field of labor economics and relations, with emphasis on issues related&#13;
to surplus labor. The services of this expert will be required for 1.5&#13;
months for the study of the introduction of the market mechanism in&#13;
highway maintenance as well as for the study of mechanization of&#13;
highway maintenance operations.&#13;
(c)   One senior highway engineer with a minimum of 15 years experience in&#13;
maintenance management, with emphasis on equipment for highway&#13;
maintenance. It is envisioned that the services of this specialist will be&#13;
needed for about 1.5 months, primarily for the study of mechanization of&#13;
highway maintenance operations, but also for general support to the other&#13;
three studies.&#13;
(d)   One highway engineer with a minimum of 15 years experience in&#13;
development of RDB, PMS and in highway maintenance. The services of&#13;
this expert will be required for about 4 person-months for the development&#13;
of the provincial RDB.&#13;
16.  In addition to the services of the international experts, local staff would be trained&#13;
in the following areas as follows:&#13;
(a)   8 persons would be trained for one month abroad (total 8 person-months)&#13;
in the areas of maintenance management and maintenance by contract, and&#13;
11 persons would be trained in the same areas in China for one month&#13;
(total 11 person-months).&#13;
(b)   2 persons would be trained for one month abroad in the area of traffic&#13;
volume data collection and processing (total 2 person-months) and&#13;
6 persons would also be trained in the same areas in China for I month&#13;
(total 6 person-months).&#13;
(c)   Training for RDB development consisting of:&#13;
(i)    5 persons for 3 weeks (total 3.7 person-months) abroad in the area&#13;
of road view video image capture system;&#13;

(ii)    5 persons for 3 weeks (total 3.7 person-months) abroad in the area&#13;
of object-oriented database/programming technology;&#13;
(iii)   2 international experts for a total of I person-month to train local&#13;
experts in the area of GIS technology.&#13;
17.   The cost of the above training is estimated at about $200,000 for training abroad,&#13;
and Y 310,000 (equivalent to about $37,000) for training within China, and $30,000 for&#13;
two international experts to come to China. The total cost is estimated at about $267,000.&#13;

Reports&#13;
19.   For each of the four areas of the proposed study, it is expected that the following&#13;
reports will be prepared and where pertinent will be reviewed by the international and&#13;
national experts and would then be submitted to the Leading Group and the World Bank&#13;
for review and comments.&#13;
(a)   Inception Report. This report will be completed within two months of&#13;
the start of each of the four parts of the study and would include the&#13;
revised work plan, comments on the terms-of-reference as well as&#13;
proposed changes to them and the related staffing and study&#13;
implementation schedule.&#13;
(b)   Progress Reports. These reports will be issued every three months, with&#13;
the first one to be submitted three months after the issue of the Inception&#13;
Report.  They will present progress on the various tasks, provide&#13;
information on partial findings worth bringing to the attention of the&#13;
Leading Group and the Bank, identify main problems, if any, and present&#13;
suggested solutions.&#13;
(c)   Draft Final Report. This report will present the results of each of the&#13;
four parts of the study and would present the findings and&#13;
recommendations. The timing of the submittal of each of these reports is&#13;
shown in the study schedule.&#13;
(d)   Final Report. The draft report for each of the four parts of the study will&#13;
be discussed in a meeting (to be held in Xian within two months of its&#13;
submission) involving the Leading Group, the Bank, and the Study Team.&#13;
Based on comments received and the results of this meeting, the Final&#13;
Report will be prepared within two months of this meeting and submitted&#13;
to the SPTD, the Leading Group, and the Bank.&#13;
(e)   Study Schedule. It is expected that each of the study of organization of&#13;
highway maintenance and the introduction of the market mechanism into&#13;
highway maintenance and the study of improved collection and analysis of&#13;
traffic volume dates would require about 18 months after selection of the&#13;
international experts until submission of the draft final report. Similarly,&#13;
the study of mechanization of highway maintenance would require about&#13;
two years. As for the study of RDB, it is expected to require about 30&#13;
months (see Appendix 1).&#13;

ANNEX 4: ROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT&#13;
General&#13;
1.    The traffic accident situation in Shaanxi (as in other provinces in China) is&#13;
serious. During 1990-94, annually about 7,860 accidents took place, resulting in about&#13;
1,540 fatalities and about 4,290 injuries. The number of accidents is not high, but this&#13;
may reflect a low degree of reporting of accidents, especially in rural areas. However, the&#13;
number killed is relatively high, and the rate of 75 killed per 10,000 motor vehicles is&#13;
high and is about 40 times higher than that for Western European and North American&#13;
countries. But, the number killed per 100,000 population (0.5) is less than that in those&#13;
same countries. Also, the severity rate (26 percent) defined as the number killed divided&#13;
by the total number killed and injured is high.&#13;
2.    Due to this situation, the Bank engaged the services of two separate experts-one&#13;
a Danish and the other a Norwegian safety expert under Danish and Norwegian Trust&#13;
Funds respectively, to study the topic, identify the problems, develop a generalized&#13;
program for tackling the road safety problem and define a component for inclusion in the&#13;
proposed project. The Danish and Norwegian experts visited Shaanxi in April 1995&#13;
(preparation/preappraisal) and July 1995 (appraisal of the project), respectively, and&#13;
submitted their final reports in May and August 1995 respectively. These reports form&#13;
the basis for the contents of this annex.&#13;
Institutions Involved&#13;
3.    Roadway safety is a complex subject involving many issues (driver, vehicle, road,&#13;
environment, engineering, education, enforcement, attitudes and behavior, etc.) and many&#13;
entities. The Traffic Police Team of Shaanxi Public Security Bureau (PSB) has the major&#13;
role. It is responsible for vehicle testing and licensing, driver training and testing, traffic&#13;
law enforcement, information and education, and collection and treatment of accident&#13;
data. In each prefecture, there is a Traffic Police Branch and in each county, there is a&#13;
Traffic Police Brigade. Each brigade has one or more Traffic Police Squadrons, which&#13;
are responsible for the management of traffic as well as propaganda. The total number of&#13;
traffic police in Shaanxi was about 6,500 in 1995. The Shaanxi Provincial Transport&#13;
Department (SPTD) is responsible for design, construction and maintenance of highways,&#13;
as well as installation and maintenance of road traffic signs and markings. Also, the&#13;
Shaanxi Scientific Research Institute, when asked by Public Security, undertakes vehicle&#13;
testing and studies of accidents. Hospitals treat accident victims and ambulance services&#13;
transport victims.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133 -                      ANNEX4&#13;
Existing Situation&#13;
4.    There is a variety of traffic safety activities taking place in Shaanxi province.&#13;
These activities do, however, seem to be relatively isolated activities. Even though most&#13;
of the activities are managed by SPTD and PSB, and there are reasonable relations&#13;
between the two, there seems to be limited coordination. The most important deficiency&#13;
does seem to be the total lack of long-term planning within the field of traffic safety.&#13;
Another important problem is that there is little development work going on within this&#13;
field. The main objectives of the traffic safety component will therefore logically be to&#13;
strengthen the capacity for policy-making and planning, and to initiate some pilot&#13;
development work. This should hopefully start a lasting process consisting of the&#13;
development of regular traffic safety planning and coordination, which is a prerequisite&#13;
for efficient comprehensive traffic safety work. It is further believed that the pilot work&#13;
on black spot improvement will start a lasting process, as this way of working has proven&#13;
to be one of the most efficient activities within traffic safety work. Also, the work on&#13;
accident statistics will hopefully give birth to future research on the relationship between&#13;
accidents and accident contributing factors.&#13;
5.    It was observed that the existing accident data collection system is adequate, even&#13;
if there is room for improvement. This system was elaborated a few years ago and is&#13;
used in all provinces, and hence it is not subject to local modifications for the time being.&#13;
6.    It should be noted that in general, both in SPTD and PSB, there is an agreement as&#13;
to the description of the accident situation as unsatisfactory.  When it comes to&#13;
monitoring and improvements, however, it is sometimes difficult to get a positive&#13;
response. There is a general reluctance in considering possible improvements. The&#13;
present situation and present procedures are to a certain degree considered as sacred, and&#13;
improvements are not looked for.&#13;
7.    The agreements presented on the following pages are based on the discussions&#13;
between the missions, SPTD and PSB. The implementation of some elements will be&#13;
subject to approval by the Provincial Government.&#13;
Traffic Safety Policy And Planning&#13;
8.    Leading Group For Traffic Safety Planning. It was agreed to establish a&#13;
Leading Group for traffic safety coordination, policy-making and planning. The Leading&#13;
Group will be chaired by the Vice Governor, and it will have two representatives from&#13;
each of SPTD and PSB. The Deputy Directors of SPTD and PSB respectively will act as&#13;
Vice Chainnen. The main functions of the Leading Group will be to monitor the accident&#13;
situation and to propose strategies and policies as well as comprehensive traffic safety&#13;
plans to the Provincial Government. Such plans should include all aspects of traffic&#13;
safety work, also those parts which are outside the responsibility of SPTD and PSB. The&#13;
analyses of the situation should be done on a yearly basis. Short-term action plans should&#13;
also be developed on a yearly basis and objectives and longer-term plans should equally&#13;
be revised at regular intervals. The Leading Group will be a permanent group, and its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-134 -                       ANNEX4&#13;
activities will go on after the termination of the project. The Leading Group will act as a&#13;
board for the Traffic Safety Unit (see below). It is anticipated that the Leading Group&#13;
will meet a few times per year. The Leading Group shall be established by the end of&#13;
February 1996. Establishment of this group will be a condition for Board presentation.&#13;
SPTD will inform the Bank once the Leading Group has been established. The first&#13;
tentative policy and action plan shall be presented by the end of 1997.&#13;
9.    A Traffic Safety Unit. It was agreed to establish a Traffic Safety Unit (TSU) in&#13;
order to prepare the work for the Leading Group. It is suggested that TSU be&#13;
administratively situated in SPTD. TSU will be staffed by personnel from SPTD and&#13;
PSB. One part of TSU will be permanently staffed. This part will act as the secretariat of&#13;
the Leading Group. The Secretariat will be established by February 29, 1996, and the&#13;
Bank will be informed once it is established.&#13;
10.   The Secretariat will carry out analyses of the traffic accident situation, and on the&#13;
basis of such analyses it will prepare traffic safety objectives, strategies and short- and&#13;
long-term traffic safety plans. These objectives, strategies and plans will be presented to&#13;
the Leading Group, which will discuss them in an annual conference on traffic safety.&#13;
When adopted by the Leading Group they will be presented to the Provincial&#13;
Government. The Secretariat will monitor the situation and suggest new actions to be&#13;
taken and new studies to be undertaken. The Secretariat will also act as a resource group&#13;
for the authorities. In carrying out their duties, the Secretariat should have the possibility&#13;
to get professional assistance from the staff in SPTD and PSB when needed.&#13;
11.   Shortly after its creation, two members of the Secretariat will be offered a four-&#13;
week study trip abroad. The training will focus on accident monitoring, on the&#13;
elaboration of traffic safety objectives and the development of traffic safety policies and&#13;
plans, and also on the necessity to undertake regular traffic safety development work and&#13;
research. Another part of TSU will carry out various traffic safety studies. The staffing&#13;
will correspond to the need defined by the ongoing studies. The studies will be initiated&#13;
by July 1996, and the Bank will be informed on their initiation.&#13;
Safety Audit Procedures&#13;
12.   It has been seen in industrialized countries that despite detailed road design&#13;
manuals, new road plans do not meet all the requirements for safety. Many countries are&#13;
now introducing what is called safety audits of new road plans. This work consists of the&#13;
development of a number of check lists and guidelines that explain how to check road&#13;
design to ensure that the roads do not contribute to the occurrence of accidents.&#13;
13.   It was agreed that such safety audit procedures shall be developed by TSU during&#13;
the project period. In this regard, Shaanxi Province should avail itself of the safety audit&#13;
work to be carried out under the Bank-financed Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway Project&#13;
(Loan 3569-CHA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-135 -                       ANNEX4&#13;
Improved Computer Software&#13;
14.   The existing accident data collection form provides a large amount of data on&#13;
each accident. This makes it possible to analyze the accident data in many ways that are&#13;
useful for traffic safety planning and traffic safety work. However, the current software&#13;
only allows a few such analyses to be carried out, which seriously hampers the&#13;
exploitation of the accident data.&#13;
15.   It was agreed to improve the traffic accident reporting forms, review the coding of&#13;
the geographic location of accidents, install the British Transport Research Laboratory&#13;
(TRL) Microcomputer Accident Analysis Package (MAAP) at PSB headquarters and at&#13;
TSU, and train the staff in the related activities. Twenty-five police staff from all&#13;
prefectures would be trained in registration, location coding, and data verification. An&#13;
international consultant for 3.5 person-months would help in the training, installing&#13;
MAAP, revising the accident data forms and geographic location system as well as&#13;
adjusting the MAAP system on the basis of early experience with its use.&#13;
Pilot Black Spot Work&#13;
16.   Traffic safety work in industrialized countries has shown that the improvement of&#13;
traffic accident black spots is one of the most efficient traffic safety measures. Black spot&#13;
improvement work consists of the following steps:&#13;
(a)   Identification of black spots&#13;
(b)   Analyses of the accident situation&#13;
(c)    Selection of improvement measures&#13;
(d)   Implementation&#13;
(e)   Monitoring&#13;
17.   It was agreed that pilot black spot work be carried out as part of the project during&#13;
the first four years of the project period (1997-2000). For this purpose, a black spot&#13;
group will be established with TSU. The group will consist of five persons from the&#13;
Road Maintenance Section and the Road Management Section of the Highway&#13;
Administration Bureau.&#13;
18.   The study shall be carried out as an experiment with control site. Some 20-30&#13;
black spots will be identified. Out of these, some 10-15 are selected at random for&#13;
treatment. The rest will constitute the control sites. It will be tried to select half of the&#13;
black spots at grade intersections (X-crossings and Y-crossings) and half of them at road&#13;
sections. Some should be near urban areas and some in rural areas.&#13;
19.   It is reported that black spots can be identified with the existing accident data&#13;
analyses program. The data forms will be made available by the police at the prefecture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-136 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
level, where they are stored. The accident reports and sketches from the accidents at the&#13;
black spots will be made available to the black spot group by the police at the county&#13;
level.&#13;
20.   For the analyses of the black spots and their traffic, the group will be provided&#13;
with a vehicle, a photo camera, a video camera and monitor, a speed radar, a friction&#13;
detector and two rulers (steel and leather), and for office work it will be provided with a&#13;
computer and a printer.&#13;
21.   Three members of the black spot unit will initially be trained in China for a total&#13;
of 5 person-months and outside China for a total of 3 person-months. Also, about 3.5&#13;
person-months of international expert(s) will be provided for general support of the Unit,&#13;
review of results of studies and guidance on new activities to be undertaken.&#13;
22.   Subsequent to the analyses, SPTD will implement the proposed improvements. A&#13;
special budget of Y 10 million will be established by SPTD for this purpose. One million&#13;
yuan will be allocated the first year, and then two, three and four million in the following&#13;
years. This special budget will also cover all specific costs related to the black spot&#13;
analyses.&#13;
23.   The black spot work is expected to be initiated by January 1997 and go on for a&#13;
four-year period. After termination of the pilot black spot work, the black spot work will&#13;
be transferred to the Maintenance Section at the prefecture level on a permanent basis.&#13;
The personnel who participated in the pilot black spot work would be responsible for the&#13;
training of the relevant personnel at the prefecture level.&#13;
Storage of Accident Files&#13;
24.   In order to carry out black spot work, it is necessary to get hold of complete data&#13;
concerning the accidents at the black spots. The identification of the black spots will&#13;
identify the place of the black spot and the number of accidents at the black spot, and it&#13;
will provide serial numbers of the accidents that have occurred.&#13;
25.   The definition of a black spot is a place where many accidents have happened&#13;
during a certain period of time. It is obvious that one has to consider a period covering a&#13;
number of years. At present, it is required to keep the accident data for at least three&#13;
years, and current practice in Shaanxi province is to destroy the files after three years. It&#13;
is obvious that this can seriously hamper the possibility for carrying out black spot work.&#13;
It was therefore agreed that this practice will be changed, and that accident files will be&#13;
kept at the county level for five years in the future.&#13;
Accident Analyses&#13;
26.   The knowledge about accidents and their contributing factors is extremely limited&#13;
today. The police identifies what they consider to be the "cause" of the accident.&#13;
Thereby they can determine the percentage of the accidents which is caused by for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-137-                         ANNEX4&#13;
example "reckless driving." This is, however a legal consideration, and it is seldom&#13;
fruiitful for initiating traffic safety actions. It is widely accepted today that an accident is&#13;
a multifactoral event, meaning that it is a combination of many factors, which in a certain&#13;
combination leads to an accident. This implies that the accident can be avoided by&#13;
influencing any of the present factors. An important step in traffic safety work is&#13;
therefore to identify factors that are overrepresented in accidents.&#13;
27.   It was agreed that TSU would undertake statistical work to describe the accidents&#13;
according to all the contributing factors that are available on the accident form currently&#13;
in use. This could, for example, be used to determine the number of accidents per type of&#13;
vehicle. When compared with the vehicle population, this will give an idea about the&#13;
relative risk between the different types of vehicles.&#13;
Driver Training Study&#13;
28.   Driver training and driver behavior are important factors that affect the occurrence&#13;
of accidents. Despite a very long driver training period and an apparently comprehensive&#13;
training curriculum, the Shaanxi traffic police claim that unqualified drivers are an&#13;
important accident-producing factor. This could imply that there are deficiencies in the&#13;
driver training system, and that safety improvements could be obtained by improving the&#13;
driver training system. Appendix 1 to this Annex presents the outline terms of reference&#13;
for a study of driver training in Shaanxi. The study will be carried out by a local team&#13;
assisted by 1 person-month of an international specialist. The results of the study would&#13;
be useful to Shaanxi Province, MOC, PSB, and other provinces in China.&#13;
Evaluation of the Traffic Safety Component&#13;
29.   The objective of the traffic safety component is, first of all, to initiate activities&#13;
that will start processes leading to improved traffic safety in a longer perspective. In&#13;
order to reach the objective, it is important that all activities are carried out and that there&#13;
is a reasonable follow-up. If this is not the case, correcting actions should be taken. It&#13;
has therefore been agreed that by the end of the fifth year, a qualified Chinese consultant,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, for 1 person-month shall carry out an independent evaluation of&#13;
the implementation of the highway safety component.&#13;
Costs&#13;
30.   Table 1 summarizes the cost of the road safety program.  The total cost is&#13;
estimated at about Y 13.0 million, of which Y 10.0 million is for implementation of the&#13;
accident black spots.&#13;
31.   Implementation Program. The road safety program will be implemented over&#13;
four years (1997-2000). Equipment is expected to be procured in 1997. Training will be&#13;
implemented during 1997 and 1998 and the driver training study in 1998.&#13;
Implementation of the accident black spots will span four years (1997-2000).&#13;

APPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX 4: OUTLINE TERMS OF&#13;
REFERENCE FOR DRIVER TRAINING STUDY&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The traffic accident situation in Shaanxi Province, expressed as the number of&#13;
persons killed per 10,000 vehicles, is relatively representative of the situation in China,&#13;
but very poor compared to industrialized countries.  Important improvements are&#13;
therefore needed. Driver training and driver behavior are important factors that affect the&#13;
accident situation. Despite a very long driver training period, and an apparently&#13;
comprehensive driver training curriculum, the Shaanxi police claim that unqualified&#13;
drivers are an important accident-producing factor. With the hypothesis that good&#13;
training produces qualified drivers, and that qualified drivers are safe, this could imply&#13;
that there are deficiencies in the driver training system, and that safety improvements&#13;
could be obtained by improving the driver training system.&#13;
Content&#13;
2.    The study should basically compare actual driver behavior with required behavior.&#13;
It is important to select behavioral elements that are believed to be related to traffic&#13;
safety. The driver's knowledge in first aid should also be included in the study. When&#13;
behavior deficiencies are detected, the study should discuss if the deficiencies are most&#13;
effectively corrected by improved training or by law enforcement, and hence make&#13;
suggestions as to improvements in the driver training system.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
3.   (a)   Define required behavior for a number of behavioral elements:&#13;
approximately 5 person-months;&#13;
(b)   Observe actual driver behavior: approximately 35 person-months;&#13;
(c)   Detect discrepancies between required and observed behavior:&#13;
approximately 10 person-months;&#13;
(d)   Evaluate the most efficient improvement agent: approximately 10 person-&#13;
months; and&#13;
(e)   Make suggestions as to improved driver training procedures:&#13;
approximately 12 person-months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -         Appendix 1 to ANNEX 4&#13;
4.    The study will be carried out by three representatives from SPTD during a two-&#13;
year period. During the initial phase of the study, the team will be assisted for one month&#13;
by an international specialist on driver behavior research.&#13;
Budget&#13;
5.    The study will require 6 person-years at a total cost of Y 60,000. This cost&#13;
element is included in the budget for the traffic safety component of the Second Shaanxi&#13;
Provincial Highway Project. It is believed that no further manpower input is required.&#13;
6.    The study will further require I person-month input from an international expert&#13;
at a total cost of about Y 200,000. This cost element is included in the budget for the&#13;
traffic safety component of the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project.&#13;
7.    Other cost elements, particularly related to data collection, are difficult to&#13;
evaluate. Such cost elements will be covered by a special budget (Y 10 million)&#13;
established by SPTD for black spot improvement and traffic safety studies as a part of the&#13;
Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project.&#13;

ANNEX 5: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND&#13;
ACTION PLAN SUMMARY&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) of the following four major highways&#13;
were carried out by Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Environmental Protection Science [(a)&#13;
and (d) below] and Xian Highway Transportation University [(b) and (c) below]. The&#13;
EIA reports were submitted to the Bank in October 1994 and reviewed by the Bank&#13;
during the identification mission in October 1994.&#13;
(a)   Weinan-Tongguan Section (WTE: 78.1 km) of Xian-Tongguan&#13;
Expressway;&#13;
(b)   Northeastern Section of Xian Bypass (11.0 km) of Xian-Tongguan&#13;
Expressway;&#13;
(c)   Tongchuan-Huangling four-lane Class I Highway (THH: 71.3 km) and&#13;
doubling of two-lane Class II Auto-only Highway (Yaoxian-Tongchuan&#13;
Section: 18.4 km); and&#13;
(d)   Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Class II Auto-only Highway (LXH: 48.3 km).&#13;
2.    Based on the comments by the Bank, revised EIA reports and Environmental&#13;
Action Plans (EAPs) of the above highways, EIA reports and EAPs of the following&#13;
three, two-lane Class II Auto-only highway connections, and an Environmental&#13;
Assessment Summary (EA Summary) covering all seven highways were prepared and&#13;
submitted to the Bank in January 1995. The Bank commented in March 1995 and further&#13;
discussed them during the preparation mission in April 1995. During the preparation&#13;
mission, it was decided that the Northeastern Section of the Xian Bypass will be dropped&#13;
from the project, considering that the approval had not been obtained from the central&#13;
government agencies including the Cultural Relics Department on the proposed&#13;
alignment of the Northwestern Section of the Xian Bypass, which would affect the&#13;
alignment of the Northeastern Section. The draft final EIA reports, EAPs of all the six&#13;
highways [(a), (c) and (d) in para. 1 and (a)-(c) in this para.] including interconnecting&#13;
roads, and the EA Summary covering them were submitted to the Bank in May 1995.&#13;
(a)   Lintong-Terra Cotta Warriors Museum two-lane Class II Auto-only&#13;
Highway (LTH: 5.9 km);&#13;
(b)   Jiangzhuang-Famen Buddhist Temple two-lane Class II Auto-only&#13;
Highway (JFH: 20.1 kin); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-142-                      ANNEX S&#13;
(c)   Jiangzhuang-Tangyu two-lane Class II Auto-only Highway (JTH:&#13;
15.7 km).&#13;
3.    Regarding the rural roads improvement program to alleviate poverty (RIPA) in a&#13;
number of poor counties, it was agreed that a Sectoral Environmental Assessment&#13;
approach would be applied. Accordingly, EIA reports and EAPs for the first batch of&#13;
projects under the RIPA component were prepared and submitted to the Bank in May&#13;
1995.&#13;
4.    These EIA-related documents including those for the six high-grade highways and&#13;
RIPA projects were reviewed and discussed during the appraisal, and the revised EIA-&#13;
related documents were submitted to the Bank in September 1995, and found satisfactory.&#13;
5.    An EIA was also undertaken for the improvement/upgrading of Xian-Sanyuan&#13;
Class I Highway (XSH) and its relief road, which was added to the project during the&#13;
appraisal in July 1995. The EIA report and EAP were submitted to the Bank in October&#13;
1995, and reviewed by the Bank during the highway mission in November 1995. Based&#13;
on the comments by the Bank, the revised documents were submitted in December 1995&#13;
and found satisfactory.&#13;
6.    The process of environmental review in)volved inputs from various units in the&#13;
province, including environmental protection bureaus, research institutions and&#13;
universities. The affected groups and NGOs along the highways, and the people subject&#13;
to resettlement and land acquisition in particular, have been intensively consulted.&#13;
7.    The policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessment of&#13;
development projects in China were followed during preparation and evaluation of the&#13;
EIA, as well as the Bank's OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. Major laws and&#13;
regulations applied to the EIA for the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project are&#13;
presented below. The major environmental standards applied in the EIA are listed in&#13;
Appendix 1 of this Annex.&#13;

-145 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
C. BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION&#13;
10.   Geology and Topography: Weinan-Tongguan Expressway and three Class II&#13;
auto-only highway connections (LTH, JFH and JTH) go through the areas in the Wei&#13;
River Basin, Guanzhong Plain with Qinling Mountains to the south and the Wei River,&#13;
Jing River and the Yellow River to the north. The land is broad, plain and partially&#13;
terraced with an average height of approximately 340-400 m above the sea level. The&#13;
Guanzhong area is one of the areas of active earthquakes and Xian is on the earthquake&#13;
belt with 8 scale intensity between the Fen River and Wei River. The intensity of the&#13;
typical earthquake in the Wei River Basin is usually about 7 scale. The Lantian-&#13;
Xiaoshangyuan Class II Highway goes through the mountains and hilly areas in front of&#13;
the Qinling Mountains, along the valleys of Senen Winding River, Lan Bright River and&#13;
Clear River. Both sides of the river valleys are steep and the rivers run quite fast. The&#13;
Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Highway (THH) goes through the southern part of the&#13;
North Shaanxi Loess Plateau, getting higher toward the northwest. THH goes through&#13;
loess ridges along the Wang River, the Half Valley and Xi River and then rock-based&#13;
mountains with steep cliffs and deep valleys.&#13;
11.   Climate and Hydrology. Except THH, the other proposed highways are being&#13;
constructed in the eastern part of Guanzhong Plain where the climate is fairly warm&#13;
(average temperatures range 13-14°C), wet with long winters and summers, and with&#13;
moderate rainfall that concentrates in July, August and September (annual rainfall range&#13;
600-700 mm). THH goes through the southern part of the Loess Plateau, where average&#13;
temperature ranges 9-1 0°C and annual rainfall from 630 to 650 mm. The highways under&#13;
the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project traverse many rivers, all of which belong&#13;
to the Wei River drainage area in the Yellow River System. The Guanzhong Plain is rich&#13;
in underground water, which is 5-15 m deep and used for drinking and farming.&#13;
12.   Economic Situation: Shaanxi is an inland province, located in the middle west&#13;
of central China, has 205,000 km  area and a population of 34 million. Its current&#13;
economic development ranks at medium level in China. The province is divided into&#13;
three areas, namely Northern Shaanxi Plateau, Guanzhong Plain and Southern Shaanxi&#13;
Mountains. The northern Shaanxi is rich in coal, natural gas and petroleum, becoming an&#13;
important base of energy resources in the country. Guanzhong Plain is the hub of&#13;
developing Shaanxi economy with its dense population, developed economy and&#13;
industries. This area also has rich tourism resources. There are plenty of mineral&#13;
deposits, biological and hydroelectric resources in Southern Shaanxi that need to be&#13;
further developed.&#13;
13.   Land Use: The main land use of the project areas is agriculture. The Guanzhong&#13;
area is the grain store of the province and the products are mainly wheat and corn with an&#13;
annual productivity of 500-650 kg/mu. Apples, grapes, etc. are also produced in the area.&#13;
The land on the hills and in the valleys is rather sterile with undeveloped irrigation and&#13;
poor yield. The annual yield of wheat or corn is approximately 140 kg/mu in Tongchuan&#13;
and no more than 240 kg/mu in Huangling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-146 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
14.   Ecological Setting: There are three categories of vegetation in the project areas,&#13;
namely Guanzhong Plain, southern part of the Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau and the&#13;
hilly area in front of Qinling Mountains. After being farmed for thousands of years, the&#13;
natural vegetation in Guangzhong Plain is nearly wiped out and all the land that can be&#13;
cultivated has become farmland with wheat, corn or fruit trees. The rock-based mountain&#13;
area west to the National Highway No. 210 in the Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau is&#13;
sparsely populated and well covered with natural forests (coverage of approximately&#13;
87 percent). The loess ridges, hills and valleys are covered with secondary forests and&#13;
bushes. The major plants are oaks, poplars, Chinese pines, birches, cypresses. etc.&#13;
Except for about 26 km (KI08-K134) of Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Highway (THH),&#13;
the vegetation in the valleys and on the loess ridges along THH is rather poor with the&#13;
forest coverage of approximately 27 percent. The area in front of Qinling Mountains is&#13;
mainly farmland with wheat, corn and sweet potatoes and secondary forests. The main&#13;
vegetation includes cypresses, white skin pines, and Chinese pines. The secondary&#13;
forests are mainly with Chinese pines and Hua pines.&#13;
15.   Shaanxi is rich in wildlife. Qinling Mountains, in front of which Lantian-&#13;
Xiaoshangyuan Highway (LXH) goes through, is a natural wildlife protection area. The&#13;
wildlife in the area includes river deer, bears, pandas, leopards, wild goats, long-tail&#13;
chickens, etc., but they are mainly living in the West Qinling Mountains. There are also&#13;
many wild animals such as gold-skin leopards (Class II national preservation) and&#13;
reindeers in the Northern Mountains where THH goes through. In addition, there are&#13;
many wild hogs, roe deer, wolves, foxes and birds in the Province. However, these&#13;
animals are living in the deep mountains and not around the alignments of the proposed&#13;
highways. During the field investigations hardly any wild animals, rare or endangered&#13;
species, were observed along any proposed alignment.&#13;
16.   Cultural Relics: Guanzhong area is one of the places from where Chinese&#13;
culture originated. There are relics of Lantian men of millions of years ago, prehistoric&#13;
Banpo men and Emperor Xuanyuan, who is often called "the father of the nation". Xian&#13;
was called Chang'an in the ancient times. Since the Shang and Zhou dynasties, II&#13;
emperors made their courts in Xian, leaving the area with rich cultural relics and&#13;
historical sites. According to the information provided by the Shaanxi Archaeology&#13;
Research Institute in 1994, some short lengths of the proposed highways will go close to&#13;
the national and provincial cultural sites, but only a few pass through remains that need&#13;
preservation measures.&#13;
17.   Air Quality: The measured ambient air quality data indicate that the air quality&#13;
along the proposed highways is generally good. Carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations&#13;
are below the ambient air quality standard except along some sections of THH and&#13;
Lintong-Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Highway (LTH). NOx concentrations are also&#13;
below the standard except for some sections of Weinan-Tongguan Expressway (WTE).&#13;
Total suspended particulates (TSP) concentrations exceed the standard in WTE, THH and&#13;
LTH, mainly due to the resuspension of road dust. TSP concentrations also exceed the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-147 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
standard slightly in some sections in Jiangzhuang-Famen Buddhist Temple Highway&#13;
(JFH) and Jiangzhuang-Tangyu Highway (JTH).&#13;
18.   Noise: Present acoustic environmental quality is generally good along most of the&#13;
proposed highways. In some sections of WTE, the noise level in the daytime reaches the&#13;
noise standard, and a noise level of 60.8 dB(A) was measured at night in Saying, which&#13;
exceeds the standard [55 dB(A)]. The noise level exceeds the Class II standards in&#13;
daytime and at night at the school in Majiashan of THH.&#13;
19.   Water Quality: Measured surface water quality data generally meet the water&#13;
quality standards.&#13;
D. POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THEIR MITIGATION MEASURES&#13;
20.   Major potential impacts and their mitigation measures regarding Weinan-&#13;
Tongguan.-Expressway, Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Highway, Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan&#13;
Class II Auto-only Highway and Three Highway Connections (Lintong-Terra Cotta&#13;
Warriors Museum, Jiangzhuang-Famen Buddhist Temple, and Jiangzhuang-Tangyu) are&#13;
summarized below and incorporated in the Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) of the&#13;
proposed highways. The EAPs stipulate how the environmental impacts identified in the&#13;
EIA will be dealt with in the design, construction and operation phases, and what&#13;
institutional arrangements have been made for the implementation of the EAPs during the&#13;
three distinct phases. The key elements of the EAPs are summarized as Appendix 2 of&#13;
this Annex.&#13;
Design Phase&#13;
21.   The project was developed in accordance with the "Three Synchronization" rule&#13;
in China, which requires that development projects should incorporate environmental&#13;
protection measures in planning/design, construction and operation phases.&#13;
22.   Alternative Alignments: Alignments of proposed highways were selected from&#13;
among several alternatives in order to minimize land acquisition, social and economic&#13;
disturbance, adverse environmental impacts including air pollution, noise at sensitive&#13;
areas, water quality degradation and ecological disruption, and to avoid cultural relics&#13;
sites and unfavorable geological conditions.&#13;
23.   Social Disruption: In order to minimize problems of community separation and&#13;
isolation due to the project construction a large number of underpasses and overpasses&#13;
were incorporated into the project design. For example, 178 crossings (2.8 crossings per&#13;
km), 8 large, 10 medium and 6 short bridges, and 6 interchanges were included in the&#13;
design of WTE to minimize social disruption.&#13;
24.   Soil Erosion: A total of 16,588 m of slope protection, 7,030 m of retaining walls&#13;
and 164 culverts were included in the engineering design of WTE in order to facilitate&#13;
natural drainage and avoid soil erosion and slope failures. In addition, temporary and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148-                      ANNEX5&#13;
permanent drainage systems were designed to minimize soil erosion and alteration of&#13;
hydrological regimes, including impacts on irrigation. Similar measures were also&#13;
incorporated in the engineering design of other proposed highways.&#13;
25.   Noise and Air Pollution: Noise and air pollution mitigation measures were&#13;
identified and integrated into the design and bid documents. These include construction&#13;
of noise barriers, installation of surrounding walls, double-glass windows, etc. Some&#13;
buildings will be relocated due to the significant noise impacts.&#13;
26.   Water Pollution: Adequate permanent and temporary drainage systems were&#13;
incorporated in the project design to minimize surface water pollution and disturbance to&#13;
irrigation channels and existing drainage systems. Septic tanks were designed for service&#13;
area facilities in order to prevent direct discharge of waste water to public water bodies.&#13;
Underground storage tanks for gasoline and other hazardous materials will be installed to&#13;
prevent groundwater contamination.&#13;
27.   Cultural Relics:  A special cultural relics survey was carried out during&#13;
November/December 1994 by Shaanxi Provincial Archaeology Research Institute&#13;
(SPARI), following the relevant rules and regulations in China to identify cultural relics&#13;
to be affected by the project. Altogether 28 cultural sites along the proposed highways&#13;
were identified to be protected. One is under national protection, three are under&#13;
provincial protection and nine are under county protection.  The other 15 are not&#13;
classified under any special protection.  They include Yaozhou Kilns (national&#13;
importance) and Wangjiahe Remains (provincial importance) in Tongchuan along the&#13;
Tongchuan-Huangling Highway, and Hengzhen Remains and Tongguan Ancient City&#13;
(provincial importance) along the Weinan-Tongguan Expressway. Under the guidance of&#13;
the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological Bureau (SPAB), a special action plan for the&#13;
preservation of cultural relics was developed to carry out detailed field reconnaissance,&#13;
excavation and preservation of identified cultural relics and remains under the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
28.   Flooding: Bridges, culverts and roadside drainage systems were adequately&#13;
designed to meet requirements for safe discharge of flood (300 years for large bridges and&#13;
100 years for the others).&#13;
Construction Phase&#13;
29.   Fugitive Dust and Other Air Pollution: Quarries, material borrow sites, waste&#13;
disposal sites and transportation routes to construction sites were identified as the major&#13;
areas that create dust and other air pollution. Road surfaces, excavation areas and&#13;
construction sites will be sprayed with water and kept moist particularly near towns,&#13;
water sources and other sensitive locations. Access roads will be upgraded, widened and&#13;
paved where necessary, and sprayed regularly to minimize fugitive dust. Stockpiles and&#13;
storage areas will be either covered or sprayed. Construction materials will be covered&#13;
during hauling to prevent undue dust or debris on roads. Asphalt and concrete mixing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-149-                       ANNEX5&#13;
equipment will have dust collectors and will be located at least 500 m downwind of&#13;
residential areas. Construction machines will be equipped with exhaust gas control units.&#13;
30.   Noise:  Since operations of machinery associated with excavation and road&#13;
construction may cause hearing damage in the event of prolonged exposure, hearing&#13;
protection will be provided for construction workers. Construction machinery and trucks&#13;
will be equipped with proper noise control devices and will be properly operated and&#13;
maintained. Construction activities will be prohibited between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 am&#13;
near residential areas. Transportation of construction materials will be undertaken with&#13;
careful consideration to minimizing noise impacts on residents along the roadside.&#13;
Traffic management, including dissemination of traffic rules and setting up of speed&#13;
limits will be strengthened.&#13;
31.   Soil Erosion: Erosion control will be undertaken by minimizing the removal of&#13;
vegetation and by installing silt traps and other prevention measures. Excavation sites&#13;
will be reclaimed, stabilized and re-vegetated following the completion of construction&#13;
activities. Silt screens will be placed at excavation sites as appropriate. Where arable&#13;
land is selected as a material borrow site, fertile top soil will be removed, stockpiled and,&#13;
after completion of excavation, restored, and the land will be reverted to its original&#13;
condition. Temporary ponds will be placed where appropriate within construction sites to&#13;
capture eroded soil.&#13;
32.   Water Pollution: Measures will be taken to prevent direct discharge of polluted&#13;
water from construction activities into rivers and irrigation channels. Septic tanks will be&#13;
installed at construction camp sites to prevent direct discharge of sanitary sewage to&#13;
public water bodies. Sewage sludge and domestic waste from construction sites and&#13;
camp sites will be collected to be used as fertilizer or properly disposed of. Drinking&#13;
water at construction sites will meet China's national drinking water standards. Disposal&#13;
sites will be approved and secured to avoid environmental contamination. Construction&#13;
of bridge piers and material excavation from watercourses will be avoided during the&#13;
rainy seasons. Drainage interception facilities will be installed at bridges to prevent&#13;
polluted runoff from entering watercourses.&#13;
33.   Cultural Relics: Construction works will be stopped in case new cultural relics&#13;
are discovered as a result of road construction or excavation activities. The Shaanxi&#13;
Provincial Archaeological Bureau (SPAB) and the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeology&#13;
Research Institute (SPARI) will be informed immediately and a field survey of the site&#13;
will be undertaken. Necessary mitigation measures will be identified and implemented&#13;
under the supervision of SPAB and a detailed action plan will be developed as&#13;
appropriate before the construction work resumes.&#13;
34.   Traffic Management: Local resources will be used to the extent possible to&#13;
avoid long-distance transportation of construction materials. Adequate traffic control&#13;
measures will be implemented in consultation with the Transportation and Public&#13;
Security Departments when roads are congested during the construction period. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-150 -                     ANNEX 5&#13;
contractors would be required to provide adequate diversions and signs where the&#13;
construction crosses existing roads. Where sections of existing roads are used for&#13;
transportation of construction materials, temporary service roads will be constructed as&#13;
appropriate to alleviate congestion of existing roads.  A  construction material&#13;
transportation plan will be developed to avoid hauling activities during peak hours&#13;
especially on existing roads.&#13;
Operation Phase&#13;
35.   Noise and Air Pollution: Two of the most significant problems during the&#13;
operation period will be noise and air pollution from exhaust gas. According to the EIAs,&#13;
noise levels at environmentally sensitive sites along Weinan-Tongguan Expressway&#13;
(WTE), Tongchuan-Huangling Class 1 Auto-only Highway (THH) and Xian-Sanyuan&#13;
Class I Highway (XSH) will significantly exceed the noise standards set as the&#13;
assessment criteria. Similarly, NO, concentrations will exceed the ambient air quality&#13;
standards (Class II standards) at several sensitive sites. In order to supplement the EIA&#13;
results and identify necessary mitigation measures, special studies were carried out on&#13;
traffic noise protection measures for WTE, THH and XSH. Based on the above studies,&#13;
the following measures were identified and integrated in the EAPs to be implemented in a&#13;
phased manner.&#13;
36.   For WTE, Taoxia Hospital and Xiaoquen Primary School will be totally relocated&#13;
by 1999. Approximately 660 m of noise barriers will be installed by 1999. Classrooms&#13;
near the proposed expressway will be used as warehouses and the same area of&#13;
classrooms will be built on the other side of the schools (Fengliang and Fushui Primary&#13;
Schools) by 1999. Also, approximately 1,920 m of surrounding brick walls will be&#13;
constructed or made higher by 1999 around the noise-sensitive buildings such as schools&#13;
and hospitals. Approximately 1,140 m of additional walls will be constructed or made&#13;
higher in 2005, depending on the monitoring results. Further noise protection measures&#13;
such as construction of walls and installation of double-glass windows will be undertaken&#13;
at 21 noise-sensitive sites in 2013, depending on the monitoring results.&#13;
37.   For THH, approximately 260 m of walls will be constructed or made higher by&#13;
2000 around the noise-sensitive buildings.  Approximately 900 m2 of glass-walled&#13;
corridors (called front corridors) will be built by 2000 to enclose Mineral Hospital and&#13;
Yichi Middle School buildings along the proposed highway. Depending on the&#13;
monitoring results, 130m of walls will be constructed in 2?05, and double-glass&#13;
windows at two sensitive sites and 360 m2 of front corridors at one site will be installed&#13;
in 2015.&#13;
38.   For XSH, approximately 400 m of noise barriers will be installed at Liulincum&#13;
and about 250 m of surrounding brick walls will be made higher at Jinxing School by&#13;
2000. An additional 450 m (at four sensitive sites) and 1,280 m (at seven sensitive sites)&#13;
of surrounding brick walls will be constructed or heightened in 2010 and 2020&#13;
respectively, depending on the monitoring results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-151-                      ANNEX5&#13;
39.   Vehicles which do not meet noise and exhaust emission standards will be barred&#13;
from using provincial roads including the proposed highways. A tailpipe gas inspection&#13;
station will be established at Huaxian Interchange of WTE to enforce emission laws.&#13;
Public awareness campaigns and education will be undertaken to familiarize people with&#13;
air and noise pollution regulations. In order to avoid future noise and air pollution&#13;
problems, development of residential areas will be prohibited within approximately 20 m&#13;
from the edge of the proposed highways and construction of sensitive buildings such as&#13;
schools and hospitals will be prohibited within 50 m.  In order to avoid lead&#13;
contamination in crops from vehicle emissions, Chinese cabbage and other types of&#13;
vegetables will be replaced by nonedible crops within 40 m of WTE alignment after&#13;
1998.&#13;
40.   Risk of Hazardous Material Spills: The Public Security Department (PSD) and&#13;
the Transportation Department (TD) will be informed prior to transportation of hazardous&#13;
materials on the roadway, especially with regard to the nature of the hazardous materials,&#13;
the time, routes and parking places of vehicles transporting such materials.&#13;
Transportation of hazardous materials will be restricted based on the guidance of PSD.&#13;
Pertinent danger sign will be posted on the vehicles indicating the nature of hazardous&#13;
materials.  Emergency-response facilities will be installed to respond to accidents&#13;
involving spill of hazardous materials and a contingency plan will be developed to deal&#13;
with such accidents.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING&#13;
41.   During the construction and operation of the proposed highways, environmental&#13;
monitoring will be carried out to verify the actual impacts on the environment, identify&#13;
unexpected environmental problems at an early stage, and adjust environmental&#13;
protection measures as appropriate. The Environmental Monitoring Group in the Central&#13;
Supervision Laboratory will be mainly responsible for environmental monitoring during&#13;
construction. Noise, vibration and fugitive dust will be monitored by the environmental&#13;
supervisor at each construction contract section.  During the operation phase, the&#13;
environmental monitoring activities of all the proposed highways will be carried out by&#13;
the Environmental Monitoring Office to be established under the Shaanxi Provincial&#13;
Transportation Department (SPTD). An annual monitoring report would be furnished to&#13;
the Bank during the construction phase and for each of the first three years following&#13;
completion of construction.&#13;
42.   The major items to be monitored during the construction phase are air quality,&#13;
noise, and water quality. Lead in soil and crops and vehicle exhaust inspection will be&#13;
monitored in addition to the above items during the operation phase. The detailed&#13;
monitoring plan is presented below.&#13;
43.   Air Quality: Items to be monitored will include fugitive dust (by environmental&#13;
supervisors) and TSP during the construction phase and nitrogen oxides (NOJ), CO and&#13;
TSP during the operation phase. During construction, TSP will be monitored four times a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-152-                      ANNEX5&#13;
year for consecutive three days each time. Fugitive dust will be monitored in the first,&#13;
fourth, seventh and tenth days when construction work starts, and thereafter every 10&#13;
days. Monitoring sites will be construction sites, quarries and material borrow sites, and&#13;
major roads used for transportation of construction materials. Fugitive dust will be&#13;
monitored at least six places around construction sites. During the operation phase, NOR,&#13;
CO and TSP will be monitored twice a year, each time for five consecutive days and four&#13;
times per day. Monitoring sites have been identified in the EAPs.&#13;
44.   Noise and Vibration: During the construction phase, monitoring will be carried&#13;
out by Jn environmental supervisor in each contract section 2-3 times a day on a weekly&#13;
basis at construction sites and major roads used for transportation of construction&#13;
materials. Ad-hoc monitoring will also be undertaken. During the operation phase,&#13;
monitoring will be carried out four times per year, in daytime and at night at the sites&#13;
identified in the EAPs. Ad-hoc monitoring will also be undertaken.&#13;
45.   Water Quality:  During the construction phase, biological oxygen demands&#13;
(BOD) and/or chemical oxygen demands (COD), suspended solids (SS), oil, dissolved&#13;
oxygen (DO), temperature and pH will be monitored one month before the construction&#13;
works start and three times per year for two consecutive days at major public water&#13;
bodies, particularly rivers where bridges are being constructed. During the operation&#13;
phase, the same parameters will be monitored twice per year in consecutive two days at&#13;
the sites identified in the EAPs.&#13;
46.   Other Items: Pollutants in vehicle exhaust gases (CO and hydrocarbons in&#13;
gasoline vehicles, and particulates in diesel-powered vehicles) will be randomly inspected&#13;
at Huaxian Interchange at WTE. Lead content in soil and crops will be monitored once a&#13;
year during the operation phase at five locations along WTE.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF RIPA COMPONENT&#13;
47.   The Rural Roads Improvement Program to Help Alleviate  Poverty (RIPA)&#13;
includes 157 road segments under 31 systems (a set of road segment) in 25 poverty&#13;
counties of Shaanxi Province. Since the road segments under RIPA are large in number,&#13;
and most of the RIPA projects are upgrading of the existing roads and small in the size of&#13;
construction works, it was agreed that the Sectoral Environmental Assessment (EA)&#13;
approach would be applied to the RIPA projects.&#13;
48.   The Sectoral EA approach is summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE). All the RIPA projects will be&#13;
classified into two categories, Category I and Category 1I. For the RIPA&#13;
projects under the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project, however,&#13;
IEE for all RIPA projects was not carried out because necessary&#13;
information for classification was not available at the initial stage.&#13;
Therefore, classification needs to be done during the preparation of each&#13;
batch of projects, based on the above criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-153 -                      ANNEX 5&#13;
(i)    Category I projects are those that are not expected to have&#13;
significant environmental impacts.  This category of projects&#13;
include upgrading of existing roads without substantial widening&#13;
and land acquisition.&#13;
(ii)    Category lI projects are those that may have potentially significant&#13;
environmental impacts. This category of projects include new road&#13;
construction, upgrading of existing roads with substantial widening&#13;
and land acquisition, and other road upgrading projects passing&#13;
through environmentally special areas such as national parks,&#13;
nature reserves, and important cultural heritage.&#13;
(b)   Preparation/review of EIA and EAP Reports: For Category I projects,&#13;
only Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) are required to determine&#13;
various environmental protection measures to be implemented under the&#13;
projects, based on the principles of environmental protection measures.&#13;
For Category II projects, both EIAs and EAPs are required. All EIA&#13;
reports and EAPs will be submitted to the World Bank and reviewed by&#13;
the World Bank together with the application of a batch (package) of&#13;
projects.&#13;
49.   Regarding the RIPA projects under the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway&#13;
Project, only two road segments (No. 375 and 379 under No. 46 system) will be newly&#13;
constructed, while the remaining 155 road segments will be upgraded mainly from&#13;
unclassified roads to Class IV roads. The major upgrading works include:&#13;
(a)   improvement/construction of culverts;&#13;
(b)   widening of roads in a small number of road segments; and&#13;
(c)   upgrading of road conditions to all-weather earth roads.&#13;
50.   The RIPA projects will be carried out in four batches. Eight road segments in five&#13;
systems were adopted for the first batch of RIPA projects to be implemented in the first&#13;
year. Based on the above criteria, two road segments (No. 375 and 379 under No. 46&#13;
system) were classified to be Category II and the remaining six were classified as&#13;
Category I.&#13;
51.   Major Environmental Protection Measures for the RIPA Projects. Major&#13;
environmental protection measures to be commonly implemented for most RIPA projects&#13;
are summarized below and listed in Appendix 2.&#13;
Environmental protection measures during the design stage&#13;
(a)   Soil Erosion: Additional retaining walls will be constructed to protect&#13;
farmland, cultivated fields and forests.  Temporary and permanent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-154-                       ANNEX 5&#13;
drainage systems will be constructed to minimize soil erosion and&#13;
alteration of hydrological regimes, including impacts on irrigation&#13;
channels. Trees and grass will be planted to minimize soil erosion, air&#13;
pollution and enhance good landscape along the proposed road.&#13;
(b)   Water Protection: Additional temporary and permanent water pipes,&#13;
water channels and sluice will be constructed to guarantee safe drinking&#13;
water.&#13;
(c)   Selection of Borrow Sites and Disposal Sites: Appropriate borrow sites&#13;
and waste disposal sites will be identified to minimize impacts on&#13;
farmland, forests and other land use.&#13;
Environmental protection measures during the construction stage&#13;
(a)   Dust/Air Pollution: All reasonable steps, including watering, will be&#13;
taken to minimize dust pollution by construction works, particularly in&#13;
places near towns, water sources, etc. Stockpiles and storage areas will be&#13;
covered or watered to prevent dust pollution.  Trucks to transport&#13;
construction materials will be covered to minimize spills. Tar heating&#13;
sites will be located far away from residential areas on the lee side of the&#13;
wind direction.&#13;
(b)   Soil Erosion/Water Pollution: Temporary channel or conduit will be&#13;
constructed for irrigation and drainage, during the construction of a&#13;
permanent drainage system. Spoil will not be stored on riverbeds,&#13;
farmland, forests and cultivated fields to protect water sources and natural&#13;
ecology, and prevent interruption of rivers and flooding. Rivers and water&#13;
sources will be cleaned up as appropriate if they are interrupted by soil and&#13;
spoil. All reasonable measurers will be taken to prevent direct discharge&#13;
of polluted water from construction activities into rivers and irrigation&#13;
channels.&#13;
(c)   Construction Camps: Adequate measures will be taken to prevent water&#13;
pollution by wastewater from construction camp sites. Drinking water&#13;
will meet China's national drinking water standards. Garbage will be&#13;
collected in garbage cans in fixed places and disposed of regularly.&#13;
(d)   Noise: Where residences are located near the construction sites, noisy&#13;
construction works will be undertaken during the daytime. Maintenance&#13;
of machines and trucks will be strengthened to keep them with low noise.&#13;
(e)   Conservation of Land Resources: Forests will not be used for material&#13;
borrow sites. Arable land will not be selected as material borrow sites as&#13;
much as possible. If excavation has to be done in arable land, appropriate&#13;
rehabilitation works will be undertaken to minimize impacts on ecosystem&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-155 -                     ANNEX 5&#13;
and agriculture. Education of construction workers will be strengthened to&#13;
protect natural resources, wild plants and animals. Poaching will be&#13;
strictly prohibited.&#13;
(f)   Risk of Accidents: Management regulations will be established to ensure&#13;
safe construction activities.&#13;
(g)   Cultural Relics: If fossils, coins, artifacts of value or antiquity, structures&#13;
and other remains of geological or archeological interest are found, the&#13;
local cultural authority will be immediately informed of such discovery,&#13;
and excavation shall be stopped until identification of cultural relics by the&#13;
authorized institution of preservation is completed.&#13;
(h)   Traffic Management: Adequate traffic management will be undertaken&#13;
to avoid traffic congestion during the construction period. Appropriate&#13;
transportation plan for construction materials will be developed to use&#13;
adequate routes and avoid transport activities during heavy traffic hours.&#13;
Environmental protection measures during the operation stage&#13;
(a)   Transportation Management: The Public Security and Transportation&#13;
Departments will enforce necessary management measures for safe&#13;
transportation, including safe transportation of hazardous materials.&#13;
52.   Environmental Monitoring for the RIPA  Projects.  The enviromnental&#13;
monitoring will be carried out by local environmental monitoring centers through&#13;
contracts with the county construction bureaus, and the results will be reported to the&#13;
prefectural construction and environmental bureaus for review. -For the Category I&#13;
projects, dust and noise will be monitored during the construction phase and TSP and&#13;
noise during the operation phase. Water quality monitoring both in the construction and&#13;
operation phases will also be undertaken for Category II projects.&#13;
G. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
53.   The institutional arrangements for environmental protection for high-grade&#13;
highways during the construction period are summarized below and shown in Figure 1.&#13;

Design Phase&#13;
1. Route Selection     The alignments were selected from several altematives to    SPTD/SPHSDI&#13;
minimize land acquisition, impacts of air pollution and noise&#13;
on residential areas, and to avoid unfavorable geological&#13;
conditions and cultural relics.&#13;
2. Social Disruption   Adequate number of large, medium and small bridges and      SPHSDI&#13;
underpasses/overpasses were designed to meet the requirements&#13;
for crossing of local people, animals and vehicles.&#13;
3. Soil Erosion        Planting of trees and grasses on median dividers, side slopes,  SPHSDI&#13;
and along the roadside, was included in designs where&#13;
appropriate. Slope protection, retaining walls, protection walls&#13;
were incorporated in the design.&#13;
Temporary and permanent drainage systems were designed to   SPHSDI&#13;
minimize soil erosion and alteration of hydrological regimes,&#13;
including impacts on irrigation channels.&#13;
4. Dust/Air Pollution    In addition to I above, quarries, material borrow sites and waste   SPHSDI&#13;
disposal sites were selected, taking into account the dust and&#13;
other problems at environmentally sensitive locations such as&#13;
residential areas.&#13;
5. Water Pollution     Wastewater treatmnent facilities were designed for service areas    SPHSDI&#13;
(WTE, THH and LXH).&#13;
Drainage facilities were designed to prevent surface runoff from    SPTD/SPHSDI&#13;
the road to farmland.&#13;
6. Noise               In addition to I above, adequate measures such as noise     SPHSDI&#13;
barriers, brick walls and double-glass windows were identified&#13;
and integrated in the design and bid documents (WTE, THH&#13;
and XSH).&#13;
7. Flooding            Bridges and culverts were adequately sized to meet          SPHSDI&#13;
requirements for safe discharge of design flood (300 years for&#13;
large-scale bridges, 100 years for other bridges).&#13;
8. Cultural Relics     Cultural relics survey was carried out and a cultural relics  SPARIISPHSDI&#13;
preservation plan was developed.&#13;

Environmental issues    Action Taken/To be Taken                                   Responsibility     Remarks&#13;
Construction Pbase&#13;
1. DustlAir Pollution  All reasonable steps, including watering, will be taken to  Contractors&#13;
minimize dust pollution during construction, particularly in&#13;
places near towns, water sources etc.&#13;
Stockpiles and storage areas will be covered or watered to&#13;
prevent dust pollution.&#13;
Trucks to transport construction materials will be covered to&#13;
minimize spills.&#13;
Asphalt mixing sites will be located at least 500 m from&#13;
residential areas on the lee side of the wind direction.&#13;
Asphalt mixers will be equipped with adequate dust collectors.&#13;
2. Soil Erosion/Water    Trees and grasses will be planted on side slope, and along the  Contractors&#13;
Pollution              roadside, where appropriate. Appropriate measures, either&#13;
rehabilitation or reconstruction, will be taken, if the existing&#13;
irrigation or drainage systems are damaged.&#13;
In the river section, earth and stones will be appropriately&#13;
disposed of, so as not to block river bed and cause adverse&#13;
impacts on water quality.&#13;
Temporary channel or conduit will be constructed for irrigation&#13;
and drainage, during the construction of permanent drainage&#13;
systems.&#13;
All necessary steps will be taken to prevent earth and stones&#13;
from silting up rivers, water channels, or the existing irrigation&#13;
and drainage systems.&#13;
All reasonable measurers shall be taken to prevent direct&#13;
discharge of polluted water from construction activities into&#13;
rivers and irrigation channels.&#13;
3. Construction Camps   Adequate measures, such as provision of septic tanks or sewage   Contractors&#13;
treatment facilities, will be taken at the construction camp sites.&#13;
Sludge in sewage treatment pits will be disposed of regularly.&#13;
Drinking water will meet the China national drinking water&#13;
standards.&#13;
Garbage will be collected in garbage cans at fixed locations and&#13;
disposed of regularly.&#13;
4. Noise               Where residences are located within 500 m from the          Contractors&#13;
construction sites, noisy construction works will be undertaken&#13;
during the daytime (6:00am-10:OOpm).&#13;
Maintenance of machines and trucks will be improved to&#13;
minimize noise.&#13;

5. Protection of Land    Forests will not be used for material borrow sites (THH and  Contractors&#13;
Resources              LXH).&#13;
Arable land will be avoided as material borrow sites wherever&#13;
possible. If excavation has to be done in arable land, top soil&#13;
layer will be saved and retumed after construction work is&#13;
completed, so as to minimize impacts on ecosystem and&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
Education of construction workers will be strengthened to&#13;
protect natural resources, wild plants and animals. Poaching&#13;
will be strictly prohibited.&#13;
Construction trucks will be driven on the temporary roads to&#13;
avoid damage to the farmland.&#13;
6. Construction Safety   In order to guarantee construction safety, efficient lighting  Contractors&#13;
equipment and safety signs will be installed on temporary roads&#13;
during the construction, and adequate traffic regulations will be&#13;
adopted and implemented for temporary roads.&#13;
7. Cultural Relics    Excavation will be stopped immediately if any cultural relics  Contractors/&#13;
are found, and the local cultural authority will be informed of  SPAB/SPARIV&#13;
such discovery. Excavation will not be resumed until      Eng. Supervisors&#13;
identification of cultural relics by the authorized institution of&#13;
preservation is completed and necessary measures identified.&#13;
B. Traffic and         Local construction materials will be used as much as possible to   Contractors&#13;
Transportation         avoid long distance transportation, especially of earth and stone.&#13;
Adequate actions to direct traffic will be taken in consultation&#13;
with Transportation and Public Security Departments, to&#13;
prevent or minimize traffic jams during the construction period.&#13;
Where sections of existing roads are used for transportation of&#13;
construction materials, subsidiary roads will be constructed as&#13;
appropriate, so that the existing roads are not significantly&#13;
congested.&#13;
Plan for transportation of construction materials will be&#13;
developed to avoid transport activities during hours of peak&#13;
traffic.&#13;
Operation Phase&#13;
I. Noise and Air      Noise barriers or other appropriate noise protection measures  SPTD&#13;
Pollution             will be installed at locations where noise exceeds standard,&#13;
based on the results of monitoring.&#13;
Forest belts will be constructed mainly to prevent air pollution    SPTD&#13;
problems.&#13;
2. Vehicle             Vehicle noise and emissions inspection will be strengthened. If   SPTD&#13;
Management             vehicle noise and/or emissions exceed standards, the vehicle&#13;
will not pass inspection on roads till the problem is rectified.&#13;
There will be a random exhaust gas emissions inspection station&#13;
at Huaxian Interchange of WTE.&#13;
Public awareness and education will be promoted to familiarize   SPEPB/SPTD&#13;
people with the problems of air pollution and noise from&#13;
vehicles and with related regulations.&#13;

ANNEX 6: LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
1.    Context. This annex summarizes the land acquisition and resettlement aspects&#13;
associated with the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project. It is based on the&#13;
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) prepared by the Shaanxi Provincial High-Grade&#13;
Highway Administration Bureau in May 1995 for the six high-grade highways (including&#13;
the linking roads) to be constructed under the project and the RAPs for the roads under&#13;
the RIPA component prepared by the Shaanxi Provincial Highways Administration&#13;
Bureau.&#13;
2.    Legal Basis of Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Land ownership in China&#13;
rests with the government and the collectives. Collective land is cultivated by- farmers&#13;
and is managed by village councils. Cultivation rights are given to the people for varying&#13;
durations (for 3 to 15 years). Acquisition of land for development projects is governed by&#13;
national laws, provincial implementation regulations and project specific regulations&#13;
issued by provincial, municipal or county governments. Since 1982, authorities in China&#13;
have substantially revised their regulations on resettlement for different types of projects.&#13;
A specific model has been developed for resettlement arising from projects in transport&#13;
and industry. At the core of this model of resettlement are the following objectives: to&#13;
avoid or minimize resettlement; to restore or improve the standards of living of the&#13;
adversely affected people; to consult affected localities during the project design stage; to&#13;
compensate villages for land acquired from them and to compensate individuals for&#13;
houses, standing crops, or other individually held assets; to provide land to adversely&#13;
affected persons through redistribution of land in villages or to provide jobs in enterprises&#13;
to members of villages where land per capita holdings fall below specified minimum&#13;
amounts; to restore disrupted infrastructure or compensate its owner(s); and to entrust&#13;
implementation of land acquisition and resettlement to local governments.  These&#13;
principles substantially meet the requirements of Bank policy on involuntary&#13;
resettlement. Based on national principles for transport projects, the Shaanxi provincial&#13;
government will issue Land Acquisition, compensation and resettlement guidelines for&#13;
high-grade highways and RIPA component roads.&#13;
Project Components and Their Location&#13;
3.    The project involves construction of the following high-grade highways:&#13;
(a)   Weinan-Tongguan Expressway                       78.1 km&#13;
(b)   Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Auto-Only Highway    73.6 km&#13;
and Yaoxian-Tongchuan Class II Auto-Only Highway    18.4 km&#13;
(c)   Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Class II Auto-Only Highway  48.3 km&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173-                     ANNEX6&#13;
(d)   Jiangzhuang-Famen Buddhist Temple Class II&#13;
Auto-Only Highway                                18.9 km&#13;
(e)   Jiangzhuang-Tangyu Class II Auto-Only Highway    15.9 km&#13;
(f)   Jinjian-Qin Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Class II&#13;
Auto-Only Highway                                5.9 km&#13;
In addition to the above high-grade highways, the project also involves improvement of&#13;
the 32 km Xian-Sanyuan Highway and construction of roads under the Roads for&#13;
Improvement of Poverty Areas (RIPA) component. These roads are located in 25 of the&#13;
poorest counties in the northern and southern parts of Shaanxi province.&#13;
Survey of Land Acquisition Impacts&#13;
4.    High-Grade Highways. The construction of the high-grade highways and roads&#13;
under RIPA will require acquisition of land and resettlement of affected persons. A&#13;
detailed census survey of affected persons and properties was carried out in November-&#13;
December 1994 by the Shaanxi Highway Design and Survey Institute, in collaboration&#13;
with local governments and the affected persons in the project affected areas. The results&#13;
of these detailed surveys were summarized in detailed impact tables and field maps&#13;
showing the affected houses, farmlands and enterprises. Table 1 shows the summary of&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement impacts for the high-grade highways. The six high-&#13;
grade highways proposed to be constructed pass through 11 cities/counties and 45&#13;
townships. A total of 14,213 mu of land (15 mu = 1 hectare) will need to be acquired&#13;
permanently, affecting 13,097 persons while 3,734 mu will be required temporarily&#13;
during the construction period. Most of the affected persons will be rehabilitated through&#13;
redistribution of land in their existing villages. The residence registration of 1,042&#13;
persons, who cannot be provided agricultural land through land redistribution, will be&#13;
changed from rural to urban and 580 of these persons will be provided nonagricultural&#13;
jobs in enterprises. Some 548 residential houses (2,477 persons) and 34 enterprises&#13;
employing 2,156 workers will be affected. Out of these 467 houses (2,154 persons) and&#13;
23 enterprises will need to be relocated. The total number of persons affected by the&#13;
project is therefore 17,730. The total cost of the land acquisition and resettlement&#13;
program is estimated at Y 374 million (about $45 million).&#13;
5.    RIPA Component. The first year's program of the RIPA component (consisting&#13;
of five highway systems) will affect 1,291 persons due to land acquisition and 355&#13;
persons due to house relocation. About 1,248 mu (83.2 ha) of farmland and 63 houses&#13;
(5,007 m2) will be affected due to construction of roads under the RIPA component. All&#13;
the persons affected by land acquisition and/or resettlement will be rehabilitated through&#13;
land redistribution. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement for the first-year&#13;
programs under RIPA is Y 3.4 million (about $400,000).&#13;

6.    Socioeconomic Survey. The Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences has been&#13;
contracted by SPTD to carry out socioeconomic surveys of the affected persons before&#13;
the initiation of implementation of the RAP.&#13;
Principles of Resettlement&#13;
7.    The main objective of the resettlement program under the project is to ensure that&#13;
all categories of affected persons are able to at least restore, if not improve, their standard&#13;
of living after resettlement. Both national and provincial governments have adopted&#13;
principles to guide the process of resettlement in such a way that the above central&#13;
objective is achieved. These principles aim to: (a) minimize acquisition of productive&#13;
farmland and residential areas in order to reduce adverse project impacts; (b) relocate&#13;
houses and enterprises as close as possible to their initial location; (c) replace or improve&#13;
the standard and area of housing; (d) consult the affected persons regarding resettlement&#13;
options, choice of resettlement sites and the adequacy of compensation rates; (e) pay&#13;
compensation (including those without residence registration certificates) to all affected&#13;
assets at their replacement value; (f) replace farmland through land redistribution in the&#13;
same village; (g) in cases where land redistribution is not possible, to provide jobs in&#13;
enterprises and change their residence registration from rural to urban, and (h) complete&#13;
resettlement of the affected persons before construction work on the project is initiated.&#13;
Legal Framework and Policy Provisions&#13;
8.    SPTD has prepared the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) based on the following&#13;
regulations governing land acquisition and resettlement issues in Shaanxi province:&#13;
(a)   The Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China for land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement (June 1986),&#13;
(b)   Implementation regulations for Land Administration of People' Republic&#13;
of China (January 1991),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175-                      ANNEX6&#13;
(c)   Implementation procedures for Land Administration of Shaanxi province&#13;
(September 1987),&#13;
(d)   Regulations for Management of Urban Houses Removing in Shaanxi&#13;
province (March 1993).&#13;
In addition to the above regulations, Shaanxi Provincial Government and SPTD have&#13;
formulated certain provisions for resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected persons&#13;
which are described in the RAP dated May 1995 for the high-grade highways included&#13;
under the project.&#13;
Compensation and Resettlement Policies&#13;
9.    Farmland Acquisition. A majority of the persons affected by land acquisition&#13;
will be provided farm land in the same village through land redistribution. However, if&#13;
the per capita farmland holding after land acquisition falls below 0.1 mu for any affected&#13;
village and the village cannot be merged with some other village in the vicinity, the labor&#13;
declared surplus will be rehabilitated by providing nonagricultural jobs in enterprises.&#13;
Their residence registration will be changed from rural to urban, with the approval of the&#13;
Shaanxi Provincial Government. Compensation to the collective for the farmland&#13;
acquired will be paid at six times the average of annual output value of crops for the past&#13;
three years. Standing crops will be compensated at their market value.&#13;
10.   Land Leasing. Land will be required temporarily for construction of access&#13;
roads (to construction sites), material storage yards, working plants, workers' residences,&#13;
etc. Compensation will be negotiated with the local governments and will include the&#13;
following: (a) compensation for crops; (b) compensation for leased land equivalent to the&#13;
value of production of the land during the leased period; (c) cost of restoration of land to&#13;
its original condition after the project is completed. The compensation rates calculated by&#13;
aggregating the above costs are described in the RAP. No buildings will need to be&#13;
relocated due to temporary land leasing and no land redistribution of affected persons is&#13;
necessary.&#13;
11.   Affected Houses. Compensation for affected houses and buildings, owned by&#13;
enterprises or individuals, will be paid at replacement rates, negotiated with each city/&#13;
county and in consultation with the affected persons. The affected houses will be&#13;
demolished only after the affected persons have moved into their new houses. Land for&#13;
new houses and buildings will be provided by the village and the cost of the land will be&#13;
paid by the project. Specific compensation rates that represent replacement levels of&#13;
compensation are given in the RAP.&#13;
12.   Affected Enterprises. The affected enterprises will be relocated close to their&#13;
original location on land provided by the village but paid for by the project. Affected&#13;
assets will be compensated for at replacement rates and no depreciation will be deducted&#13;
while calculating the compensation payable. Workers will be employed in the same&#13;
reconstructed enterprises and they will be paid a work stoppage allowance equivalent to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-176 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
their basic wage for the duration of stoppage of work. The affected enterprises will also&#13;
be provided a production stoppage allowance for an agreed period, based on the average&#13;
net profit in the six months preceding land acquisition.&#13;
13.  Infrastructure and Other Affected Assets. Compensation for infrastructure and&#13;
other affected assets will be paid at replacement cost to the affected individuals,&#13;
collectives or governments, depending on the ownership of these assets. The rates of&#13;
compensation for affected infrastructure and other assets are provided in the RAP.&#13;
14.   Nonagriculture-based Rehabilitation.  A total of 1,042 persons along the&#13;
Tongchuan-Huangling Class I highway cannot be rehabilitated through land&#13;
redistribution. The residence registration of these persons will be changed from rural to&#13;
urban.  Persons between 18 and 55 years of age will be given employment in&#13;
nonagricultural enterprises; those above 55 years of age will receive old-age pension and&#13;
those below 18 years of age will receive "living subsidies."&#13;
15.   Job Creation. For providing jobs to eligible affected persons, two existing&#13;
enterprises (a chemical plant and a cement packing factory) will be expanded, and a new&#13;
Building Materials Plant will be started. About Y 30,000 per new job will be provided to&#13;
the enterprises providing jobs to eligible affected persons. In addition to this, Y 3,000 per&#13;
worker will be provided to the enterprises as "training allowances." The labor employed&#13;
by these enterprises will get a minimum wage of Y 200-300 per month and they will be&#13;
employed as permanent employees. A job transition allowance will be provided to&#13;
eligible persons at the rate of Y 150 per month for three months from the time of land&#13;
acquisition/work stoppage. After this period, this allowance will be increased to the&#13;
minimum wage level in the enterprise-affected area. The exact number of affected&#13;
persons to be employed in each of these enterprises and a time schedule for providing&#13;
employment have been included in the RAP.&#13;
16.   Self-Employment. The affected persons who do not wish to accept the jobs&#13;

20.   Moving and Transition Allowances. Each affected household will be paid the&#13;
following allowances: (a) a moving allowance at the rate of Y 50 per person; and&#13;
(b) transition allowance at the rate of Y 20 per person during the transition stage of house&#13;
construction.&#13;
Institutional Responsibility&#13;
21.   A "Project Headquarters" will be set up for facilitating implementation (including&#13;
RAP implementation) of the project. The Headquarters, set up in October 1995, consists&#13;
of the Deputy Provincial Governor, mayors of affected cities, a Director of SPTD, and&#13;
representatives of the provincial planning committee, the provincial construction&#13;
department, the provincial financial department, the land management department and the&#13;
electric power administration. Under the Project headquarters, Land Acquisition and&#13;
Resettlement Leading Groups (LARLGs) will be-set up for each of the highways. Each&#13;
leading group consists of deputy mayors of affected cities, deputy county magistrates&#13;
from each affected county, three representatives of the City land administration and&#13;
representatives from the City Traffic bureau, the city urban construction bureau. The&#13;
leading group is responsible primarily for coordination of the implementation of the land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement with the local governments, in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of the RAP. Since the actual implementation of the land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement program will be carried out primarily by the local county goverrnents, Land&#13;
Acquisition and Resettlement Offices (LAROs) have been set up in each affected county&#13;
consisting of 7 to 12 members including deputy county magistrate, director of land&#13;
administration, and representatives from other county-level offices. Similar groups will&#13;
also be organized at the township and village levels.&#13;
22.  In order to ensure regular monitoring of the land acquisition and resettlement&#13;
program, a "Land Acquisition and Resettlement Monitoring Office" (LARMO) set up&#13;
under the Headquarters will carry out internal monitoring of the implementation of the&#13;
RAP. The LARMO consists of a deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Land&#13;
Administration (SPLA), chief of Land acquisition office of SPLA, and representatives of&#13;
construction division and finance division of SPTD, and a representative of the&#13;
monitoring and audit division of the Shaanxi High-Grade Highway Administration&#13;
Bureau (SHGHAB). The implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement&#13;
program will be reviewed on a monthly basis until the completion of resettlement.&#13;
23.  In order to strengthen the LA&amp;R division of SHGHAB, six more staff have been&#13;
added to the division. The new and existing staff will be provided training in land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement in March 1996. The new staff was appointed on October 5,&#13;
1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-178 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
24.   SPTD has engaged the Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences for extemnal&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement program. They will also conduct a&#13;
socioeconomic survey of affected persons before the start of land acquisition&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
25.   Except for the Tongchuan-Huangling Highway (THH), the implementation of the&#13;
RAPs was initiated on October 1, 1995 and will be completed by the end of September&#13;
1996, i.e., at least one month before the proposed start of construction. The detailed&#13;
implementation schedule for the land acquisition and resettlement program is given in&#13;
Table 2. The implementation of the RAP has been divided into the following three&#13;

Grievance Redressal and Appeals Process&#13;
27.  If any affected person is dissatisfied with any aspect of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement, they can lodge a complaint with the respective county level LA&amp;R office or&#13;
directly to the LA&amp;R monitoring office under the LARLG. If the issue is not resolved&#13;
within three weeks, a written grievance can be submitted to the LARLG. The LARLG&#13;
should resolve the issue within four weeks. If the affected person is not satisfied by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-180 -                       ANNEX6&#13;
decision of LARLG, he/she can lodge a written appeal to the county-level people's court.&#13;
In case the decision of the county-level court fails to satisfy the affected person, a second&#13;
appeal can be lodged in the court of the city/prefecture. The decision of this court will be&#13;
final and binding.&#13;
Information Dissemination, Participation and Consultations&#13;
28.   The affected people will be informed through newspaper, radio, television, etc.&#13;
about the project and the proposed land acquisition and resettlement program. The&#13;
LA&amp;R institutions will also disseminate information through meetings, documents and&#13;
notices. The affected persons will be informed about the compensation standards, the&#13;
LA&amp;R institutions at the various levels, the arrangements for provision of nonagricultural&#13;
jobs, the provisions for redressal of grievances and the proposed arrangements for internal&#13;
and external monitoring of the LA&amp;R program. Each affected household will be given a&#13;
Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB) containing the above-mentioned information. It&#13;
will also list the individual resettlement entitlement of each affected person in the&#13;
household. The RIB will be distributed to the affected households two months after the&#13;
completion of loan negotiations for the project. Apart from being informed, the affected&#13;
persons and their representatives will also participate in:  (a) efforts to minimize&#13;
resettlement through choice of appropriate alignment alternatives; (b) survey of affected&#13;
persons and properties; (c) selection of new residential areas; (d) construction of new&#13;
houses; and (e) monitoring and evaluation of resettlement activities.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
29.   Two types of monitoring systems, one internal and the other independent and&#13;
external will be established concurrently.&#13;
30.   Internal Monitoring. The internal monitoring, to be carried out by the provincial&#13;
government, will monitor the implementation of the RAP and ensure compliance with the&#13;
administrative policies and regulations. It will ensure that (a) compensation is paid to&#13;
affected entities as per the established rules; (b) appropriate employment opportunities&#13;
are created for the affected persons; (c) the resettled persons are satisfied with the&#13;
compensation levels and the location of new sites; (d) all the employees of affected&#13;
enterprises have been reabsorbed in the same enterprises after relocation; (e) land&#13;
reallocation to affected persons is according to the provisions of the RAP; (f) adequate&#13;
rehabilitation arrangements have been made for persons without proper residence&#13;
registration certificates; (g) appropriate written records and accounts are maintained for&#13;
all resettlement expenses and cost overruns, if any; and (h) the information dissemination&#13;
and grievance redressal process is implemented efficiently. A minimum sample of&#13;
25 percent of the total affected population will be covered under internal monitoring.&#13;
Data regarding households covered under the monitoring process will be collected and&#13;
stored for subsequent comparisons. Internal monitoring will be carried out in two phases;&#13;
phase I will be initiated after compensation amounts have been distributed to the affected&#13;
persons so that the monitoring results can be used to initiate remedial actions; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-181-                      ANNEX6&#13;
phase II will start after the resettlement activities have been completed. The internal&#13;
monitoring agency will have the authority to report noncompliance with RAP provisions&#13;
and other deficiencies in the implementation program. A summary of internal monitoring&#13;
reports will be submitted quarterly to the project head office and every six months to the&#13;
World Bank. The first internal monitoring report will be submitted by September 30,&#13;
1996.&#13;
31.   External Monitoring. The task of external monitoring of RAP implementation&#13;
by an independent agency has been entrusted by SPTD to the Shaanxi Academy of Social&#13;
Sciences (SASS).  Apart from  physical monitoring of the land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement program, which will also be carried out by the internal monitoring agencies,&#13;
SASS will concentrate on evaluation of the implementation of the RAP. SASS&#13;
monitoring staff will select random samples for detailed monitoring, hold discussions in&#13;
affected areas/resettlement sites, and collect secondary information from project agencies&#13;
and the internal monitoring agencies. External monitoring will start along with the&#13;
initiation of land acquisition and resettlement activities and will continue beyond project&#13;
completion (until 2000). The first external monitoring report will be submitted by&#13;
December 31, 1996. In order to facilitate comparisons in standards of living before and&#13;
after resettlement, a socioeconomic survey of the affected persons will be carried out&#13;
before initiation of RAP implementation.  Subsequent monitoring reports will be&#13;
prepared every six months and also submitted to the World Bank. A final monitoring and&#13;
evaluation report will also be prepared after project completion and submitted to the Bank&#13;
by December 31, 2000.&#13;

ANNEX 9: MONITORING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
AND OPERATIONAL IMPACT&#13;
1.    The following sections describe a number of monitoring indices that could be&#13;
used in conjunction with the various project components, to "measure" the extent to&#13;
which different implementation and impact objectives are being attained in the course of&#13;
project execution and operation. They refer specifically to indicators for use with&#13;
objectives related to:&#13;
(a)   Highway Revenue and Expenditure and Highway Maintenance&#13;
(b)   High-grade Highways, Parallel Roads and Traffic&#13;
(c)   Road Improvement for Poor Areas (RIPA)&#13;
(d)   Environment&#13;
(e)   Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
(f)   Highway Safety&#13;
(g)   Institutional Strengthening and Training&#13;
2.    The indicators fall into two categories: those related to imnplementation targets&#13;
(pointing to progress in reaching intermediate and end-of-project objectives) and those&#13;
related to developmental impact objectives (pointing out both the, more immediate/short-&#13;
term conditions resulting from project investments as well as the longer-term outcomes of&#13;
these investments).&#13;
3.   It is hoped that the indicators selected will be such that the monitoring effort itself&#13;
would not constitute an undue strain on project management but will be used as an aid&#13;
and tool of effective project management.&#13;
A. REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE&#13;
Highway Revenues And Expenditures&#13;
4.    The highway sector is going through a period of rapid expansion. The revenues to&#13;
finance this expansion presently come mostly from a Road Maintenance Charge, levied&#13;
on all vehicles as a fixed annual charge or as a percentage of the gross revenues for&#13;
commercial vehicles and buses. However, in the future, revenues from tolls are expected&#13;
to form an increasing proportion of total revenue. The largest single item of proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-194-                     ANNEX9&#13;
expenditure is new construction, which leaves some fear that insufficient funds might be&#13;
available to finance a level of maintenance that will improve the existing condition of the&#13;
road network. The proposed financing plan for the sector has been reviewed by the Bank&#13;
and found to be reasonable in terms of its revenue projections and its proposals for&#13;
highway maintenance expenditure. The outcome revenues and expenditures will be&#13;
monitored throughout the implementation period of the project, so that any deviations&#13;
from the planned amounts can be quickly identified and any necessary remedial measures&#13;
to ensure sufficient funding of maintenance can be taken.&#13;
Highway Maintenance&#13;
5.    During a period of increased expenditure on new road construction, there is a risk&#13;
that insufficient funds will be applied to maintenance of the existing highway network,&#13;
and that the condition of the network will therefore deteriorate rather than improve. The&#13;
monitoring indicators for Highway Maintenance will therefore monitor both expenditure&#13;
on maintenance and reconstruction and the surface condition of the roads of each Class.&#13;
The specific indices will be:&#13;
(a)   Annual expenditure  on  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  and&#13;
reconstruction, by class of road. The objective expenditures will be those&#13;
shown in the Table of Projected Revenues and Expenditures of the&#13;
Provincial Highway Sector;&#13;
(b)   Categorization of the condition of the road surface into Excellent, Good,&#13;
Average and Regular, using the subjective criteria currently used in by&#13;
SPHAB. In time these should be replace by measures of IRI. The&#13;
objective proportions in each condition category for each road Class in&#13;
each year will be those agreed with the Appraisal Mission&#13;
&#13;

E. MONITORING OF LAND AcQUISmON AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
12.   The monitoring and evaluation of the Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) agreed&#13;
between the Bank and the Borrower will be carried out both internally and externally&#13;
(Amc&amp;&amp;). Internal monitoring will be carried out by the Planning Departnent and the&#13;
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Department of SPHGHA. An internal monitoring&#13;
report will be submitted to the Bank every six months, with the first one due on&#13;
September30, 1996 and the last one on the completion of the land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities. The Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences will conduct the external&#13;
monitoring of resettlement and will submit a monitoring report every six months, with the&#13;
first one to be submitted by December 31, 1996 and the last one at the completion of the&#13;
project (December 31, 2000).&#13;
13.   The main indicators of land acquisition and resettlement monitoring have been&#13;
identified and are included in the RAPs. They are:&#13;
(a)   Timely payment of compensation to affected entities of various categories&#13;
according to the levels described in the RAP;&#13;
(b)   Progress of construction of new houses and quality of construction, also&#13;
distance from old houses&#13;
(c)   Progress in land redistribution;&#13;
(d)   The type of productive use to which compensation amounts have been put&#13;
by the local (township and village) governments;&#13;
(e)   Restoration of production/ business activities of affected enterprises.&#13;
Payment of all types of compensation (in accordance with RAP) to affected&#13;
enterprises and workers;&#13;
(f)   Propose linkage of resettlement activities with the project implementation&#13;
schedule (resettlement to be completed at least one month before start of&#13;
construction);&#13;

F. TRAFFic SAFETY MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
The Accident Situation&#13;
14.   The general accident situation in the Province should be measured by the&#13;
following two indicators:&#13;
(a)   Number of killed per year per 10,000 vehicles&#13;
(b)   Number of killed per kilometer per year for each Class of road&#13;
For the new Expressway, the accident rates using the above indicators should be&#13;
compared with those expected for this Class of road.&#13;
Black Spots&#13;
15.   A certain number of black spots will be identified. Half of them will be treated, in&#13;
order to form an experiment group, while the remainder will form a control group. After&#13;
treatment, the accident rates expressed as fatalities or injury accidents in the two groups&#13;
will be monitored, in order to find the effect of the black spot treatment. Also, accident&#13;
data will be collected for each identified black spot for two to three years before and after&#13;
the improvement program begins and ends.&#13;
16.   The specific indicators for each black spot would include but not be limited to:&#13;
(a)   Have all the black spots been analyzed as required and the required&#13;
number been treated?&#13;
(b)   Have the black spots been physically improved?&#13;
(c)   The accident rate at the treated black spots and at the control sites.&#13;
(d)   The accident rate before and after the treatment at each site&#13;
