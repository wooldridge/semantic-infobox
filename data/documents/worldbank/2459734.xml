            Financing health care
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Health care costs are escalating rapidly
            in many countries. While many factors contribute to rising
            costs, health insurance plays a part by shielding patients
            and physicians from the real cost. In an effort to contain
            costs, governments, employers, and insurers have modified
            payment schemes and coverage, often leading to rationing and
            restricted consumer choice and in some cases to denial of
            care. Singapore is unique among developed countries in
            achieving excellent health outcomes at a low economic cost.
            Part of its success may be attributable to its health
            financing system, which combines individual responsibility
            with targeted subsidies. Despite Singapore's small
            size, with only 3.2 million residents in a land area of 660
            square kilometers, the country has been a stellar economic
            performer, rising from impoverishment only 40 years ago. Its
            per capita GDP, US$427 in 1960, rose to US$24,740 in 2000,
            one of the highest in the world. Singapore's health
            indicators are equally impressive. Its average life
            expectancy increased by 15 years from 1960 (63 years) to
            2001 (78) and is now one of the world's longest. Its
            infant mortality rate is the world's lowest, at 2.2 per
            1,000 live births, much improved from 6.6 in 1990 (and 34.9
            in 1960) and far lower than rates in most other countries.
            Both the public and the private sector provide health care
            in Singapore. The public sector provides 20 percent of
            primary care and 80 percent of hospital care through two
            integrated care networks. The private sector dominates
            primary health care, providing 80 percent through its 1,900
            clinics. The 13 private hospitals account for 20 percent of
            inpatient admissions. Singapore has 11,800 hospital beds
            (3.7 per 1,000 people).
