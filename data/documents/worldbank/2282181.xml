The &#13;
President &#13;
REPUBLIC &#13;
OF &#13;
BURUNDI &#13;
Economic Rehabilitation Credit &#13;
(Cr. 3710-BU) &#13;
Release &#13;
of &#13;
the Second Tranche &#13;
April &#13;
25,2003 &#13;
1. &#13;
On &#13;
August  29,  2002,  the  Executive  Directors  approved &#13;
an &#13;
Economic  Rehabilitation &#13;
Credit &#13;
(ERC) &#13;
of &#13;
SDR &#13;
40.8 &#13;
million &#13;
to &#13;
the Republic of Burundi. The ERC &#13;
is &#13;
an integral part &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Bank&#146;s Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) discussed by the Board on March &#13;
7, &#13;
2002, &#13;
to &#13;
support &#13;
the &#13;
transition process and the implementation of &#13;
the &#13;
Government&#146;s reform program. &#13;
The &#13;
Credit &#13;
was declared  effective on October 23, 2002, and the first tranche, of &#13;
SDR &#13;
15.1 &#13;
million, &#13;
was &#13;
released upon effectiveness. &#13;
A &#13;
second tranche, &#13;
of &#13;
SDR &#13;
15.1 &#13;
million, was &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
made available for &#13;
disbursement upon liberalization of &#13;
the &#13;
Borrower&#146;s foreign exchange system and fulfillment &#13;
of &#13;
budget-related conditions for that tranche described in this memorandum, and &#13;
a &#13;
third and final &#13;
tranche, &#13;
of &#13;
SDR &#13;
10.6 &#13;
million, was to be made available for disbursement upon fulfillment &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
conditions for that tranche. &#13;
2. &#13;
This &#13;
memorandum informs Executive Directors that &#13;
the &#13;
Second Tranche, &#13;
of &#13;
SDR &#13;
15.1 &#13;
million, &#13;
has &#13;
been  made  available  for  disbursement.  As  provided &#13;
in &#13;
Section &#13;
3.01 &#13;
of &#13;
and &#13;
Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement, staff have reviewed with &#13;
the &#13;
Government the &#13;
progress achieved &#13;
in &#13;
implementing the program. This memorandum summarizes these reviews &#13;
and reports &#13;
on &#13;
the actions taken &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Government. &#13;
It &#13;
concludes that: (a) &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
policy  framework  for  growth &#13;
and &#13;
poverty  reduction  is  consistent with &#13;
the &#13;
objectives &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
reform  program; &#13;
(b) &#13;
satisfactory progress  has  been  achieved in  the  overall  execution &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
program;  and (c) all specific conditions pertaining &#13;
to &#13;
the release &#13;
of &#13;
the Second Tranche have &#13;
been met. &#13;

OVERALL PROGRESS &#13;
OF &#13;
THE PROGRAM &#13;
I. &#13;
BACKGROUND &#13;
1. &#13;
The people  of Burundi &#13;
are &#13;
making efforts &#13;
to &#13;
bring to &#13;
an  end &#13;
a &#13;
crisis  engendered &#13;
by &#13;
recurrent conflicts &#13;
and &#13;
rivalry between the &#13;
two &#13;
main ethnic groups, the Hutu &#13;
and &#13;
Tutsi. &#13;
The &#13;
last &#13;
conflict, which broke out &#13;
in &#13;
1993, resulted in the death &#13;
of a &#13;
large number of civilians &#13;
and &#13;
left &#13;
thousands &#13;
of &#13;
victims. &#13;
It &#13;
is &#13;
believed that &#13;
more &#13;
than 250,000 people were killed &#13;
in &#13;
the eight-year &#13;
civil war, and the number &#13;
of &#13;
internally displaced persons &#13;
and &#13;
refugees &#13;
is &#13;
estimated &#13;
at &#13;
1.2 &#13;
million. &#13;
The increasing social &#13;
and &#13;
economic costs of this conflict prompted the international community &#13;
to  help &#13;
Burundi  establish &#13;
a &#13;
framework &#13;
for &#13;
negotiations towards  national  reconciliation  and &#13;
durable peace. Negotiations &#13;
in &#13;
Arusha, Tanzania resulted &#13;
in a &#13;
comprehensive peace agreement &#13;
(Arusha Accord),  signed &#13;
in &#13;
August 2000. &#13;
A &#13;
new &#13;
power-sharing Government, inaugurated &#13;
on &#13;
November &#13;
1, &#13;
2001 &#13;
in &#13;
accordance with  this  Accord, &#13;
has &#13;
the  responsibility &#13;
to &#13;
administer the &#13;
country during  the  36-month  transition period  leading to  general  democratic  elections. &#13;
The &#13;
transition period &#13;
has &#13;
two &#13;
phases, &#13;
to &#13;
respect the power-sharing principle. Pierre &#13;
Buyoya, &#13;
a &#13;
Tutsi, &#13;
has &#13;
led &#13;
the  first  18-month  period,  with  Domitien  Ndayizeye, &#13;
a &#13;
Hutu,  as  Vice  President. &#13;
Beginning May &#13;
1 &#13;
, &#13;
2003, &#13;
Mr. &#13;
Ndayizeye &#13;
will &#13;
lead &#13;
the Government &#13;
in &#13;
the second 18-month period &#13;
with &#13;
a &#13;
Tutsi, Alphonse Kadege, confirmed by the Senate &#13;
and &#13;
National Assembly &#13;
on &#13;
April 25 as &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
Vice President. However, the overall situation &#13;
on &#13;
the ground remains fragile. &#13;
2. &#13;
Burundi  continues  to  face  difficult  development  challenges.  These  include  fostering &#13;
inclusiveness,  peace &#13;
and &#13;
security,  promoting  national  reconciliation &#13;
and &#13;
good  governance, &#13;
resettling &#13;
and &#13;
reintegrating  displaced  persons &#13;
and &#13;
other  victims &#13;
of &#13;
conflict,  rehabilitating &#13;
destroyed economic &#13;
and &#13;
social infrastructure, revitalizing the economy &#13;
and &#13;
strengthening human &#13;
resource capacities. &#13;
3. &#13;
In &#13;
this environment, beginning &#13;
in &#13;
1999 the World &#13;
Bank &#13;
provided emergency assistance &#13;
within &#13;
the &#13;
framework &#13;
of &#13;
an &#13;
Interim Strategy (Report No. 1592-BU dated &#13;
July &#13;
30, &#13;
1999) to &#13;
help &#13;
support the peace process, jump-start the economy, &#13;
and &#13;
rekindle &#13;
the &#13;
reform program. Building &#13;
on &#13;
this, the TSS discussed &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Board &#13;
on &#13;
March &#13;
7, &#13;
2002 &#13;
made &#13;
an &#13;
exceptional IDA allocation to &#13;
Burundi &#13;
to &#13;
consolidate &#13;
the &#13;
progress made &#13;
and to &#13;
support economic reforms &#13;
for &#13;
growth and &#13;
poverty reduction. Within the TSS, the Economic Rehabilitation Credit (ERC) &#13;
is &#13;
designed to &#13;
support  the  transition process  in Burundi  through &#13;
the &#13;
rehabilitation &#13;
and &#13;
the recovery  of  the &#13;
economy &#13;
by &#13;
helping &#13;
to &#13;
build the foundation &#13;
for &#13;
(a) the improvement of public service delivery &#13;
and basic  social  services, (b) the  Government's efforts to  deepen  institutional &#13;
and &#13;
structural &#13;
reforms &#13;
for &#13;
sustained economic recovery &#13;
and &#13;
poverty reduction, and (c) the establishment &#13;
of a &#13;
track record for early access &#13;
to &#13;
relief under the Enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Country &#13;
(HPC) &#13;
Initiative. The &#13;
ERC &#13;
also builds on the reforms &#13;
and &#13;
analytical work &#13;
on &#13;
the public  expenditure &#13;
management system carried out under the TSS. &#13;

4. &#13;
Restoration &#13;
of &#13;
peace. &#13;
The &#13;
political  transition &#13;
is &#13;
proceeding  with  the  handover  from &#13;
President &#13;
Buyoya &#13;
to Vice-president Ndayizeye &#13;
on &#13;
schedule &#13;
for &#13;
May &#13;
1, 2003. While &#13;
two &#13;
rebel &#13;
groups, "Forces Nationales  de Liberation" (FNL) and  "Forces &#13;
de &#13;
Defense &#13;
de &#13;
la &#13;
Democratie'' &#13;
2 &#13;
Page  4&#13;
(FDD),  did  not &#13;
sign  the &#13;
Peace &#13;
Accord &#13;
and  were  not &#13;
part &#13;
of  the  Transition  Government, &#13;
negotiations that continued under &#13;
the joint &#13;
chairmanship &#13;
of &#13;
President Mkapa of Tanzania and &#13;
Deputy President &#13;
Zuma &#13;
of &#13;
South Africa &#13;
led to &#13;
signing a cease-fire in 2002. The leadership of &#13;
the &#13;
two &#13;
groups &#13;
joined the &#13;
transition Government. Leaders of &#13;
both &#13;
sides of the ethnic divide appear &#13;
determined &#13;
to &#13;
do &#13;
whatever they can &#13;
to keep &#13;
the &#13;
peace process  on track. However, the peace &#13;
process &#13;
is &#13;
fluid &#13;
and &#13;
still unstable. One FNL-PALIPEHUTU faction and a breakaway element of &#13;
the &#13;
CNDD-FDD continue violent opposition despite a ceasefire signed &#13;
with the &#13;
CNDD-FDD &#13;
on &#13;
December &#13;
2, &#13;
2002. &#13;
Much &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
country &#13;
is &#13;
safe but  insecurity  continues &#13;
in  some &#13;
regions, &#13;
including  the  district  neighboring  Bujumbura,  Bujumbura  Rurale  province.  International &#13;
observers &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
in &#13;
place since March 2003, and an international peace-keeping force, acting &#13;
under &#13;
the &#13;
authority &#13;
of &#13;
the African Union &#13;
and &#13;
initially be &#13;
made &#13;
up of &#13;
1,500 &#13;
troops from South &#13;
Africa, &#13;
900 &#13;
from &#13;
Ethiopia &#13;
and &#13;
200 &#13;
from Mozambique, is being mobilized and will &#13;
be &#13;
in &#13;
place &#13;
by &#13;
May. &#13;
The &#13;
force's &#13;
mandate &#13;
will be to demobilize and disarm &#13;
all &#13;
armed groups &#13;
and to &#13;
set &#13;
up &#13;
an &#13;
integrated national  army &#13;
and &#13;
police  force. A committee to monitor &#13;
the &#13;
cease-fire, comprising &#13;
representatives &#13;
from &#13;
the government, rebel groups and &#13;
the &#13;
international peacekeeping force, &#13;
was &#13;
established &#13;
in &#13;
February 2003. The Government has asked &#13;
the &#13;
World Bank &#13;
to &#13;
lead &#13;
efforts to help &#13;
it &#13;
design  a Burundi  Ex-Combatants  Assistance  Program  and to  provide  financial  assistance, &#13;
within the &#13;
framework &#13;
of &#13;
the Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP). &#13;
5. &#13;
The peace process in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo &#13;
is on &#13;
track, terminating &#13;
on April 2 &#13;
2003 &#13;
with &#13;
an &#13;
agreement for a transition government. Nonetheless, &#13;
the &#13;
considerable &#13;
violence that continues &#13;
in &#13;
the Eastern parts &#13;
of &#13;
the DRC has &#13;
a direct implication for Burundi, &#13;
in &#13;
terms &#13;
of &#13;
its &#13;
security as well as &#13;
its &#13;
markets. &#13;
In &#13;
recent bilateral discussions, Burundi agreed to &#13;
withdraw &#13;
its &#13;
forces  from  the &#13;
DRC &#13;
while &#13;
the &#13;
Congolese  government pledged  to  discontinue &#13;
support to  the Burundian  armed groups. &#13;
The &#13;
international  community's  support for both &#13;
the &#13;
Lusaka process (which deals with &#13;
the &#13;
conflict &#13;
in the &#13;
DRC) and &#13;
the &#13;
Arusha process &#13;
is &#13;
essential for &#13;
consolidating peace &#13;
in the &#13;
Great Lakes Region. &#13;
6. &#13;
Within &#13;
the &#13;
transitional &#13;
govemment,  people &#13;
are  collaborating. &#13;
This  collaboration &#13;
continues &#13;
at &#13;
all levels. There are indications of commitment &#13;
of &#13;
most stakeholders to &#13;
peace &#13;
and &#13;
the creation of a viable transition process, characterized &#13;
by &#13;
potentially credible institutions,  a &#13;
strong &#13;
anti-poverty  program  and  the  protection &#13;
of &#13;
human &#13;
rights.  Burundi  has  produced  in &#13;
November 2002 &#13;
an &#13;
Interim PRSP (I-PRSP), &#13;
which &#13;
has been submitted to &#13;
the &#13;
Bank and IMF for &#13;
their &#13;
joint &#13;
staff &#13;
appraisal. &#13;
An &#13;
appraisal mission &#13;
is &#13;
planned  for &#13;
June &#13;
2003.  The &#13;
2003 &#13;
budget &#13;
reflects priorities identified &#13;
in the &#13;
I-PRSP. &#13;
7. &#13;
As &#13;
peace &#13;
progresses &#13;
and &#13;
takes &#13;
hold, &#13;
Burundi &#13;
faces &#13;
an &#13;
enormous &#13;
problem &#13;
of &#13;
demobilization of combatants, &#13;
the &#13;
resettlement &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
million &#13;
persons-nearly &#13;
15 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
population-who &#13;
are refugees or internally displaced, and assistance to &#13;
those have &#13;
suffered from &#13;
conflict internally. &#13;
Social &#13;
and &#13;
economic institutions &#13;
must &#13;
be &#13;
rebuilt and social institutions that &#13;
discourage violence &#13;
as &#13;
a method of resolving conflicts need to be buttressed. &#13;
111. &#13;
MACROECONOMIC &#13;
POLICY &#13;
FRAMEWORK &#13;
8. &#13;
The economy &#13;
has &#13;
recovered significantly during &#13;
2002 &#13;
and early 2003, driven &#13;
by &#13;
favorable &#13;
weather for agriculture &#13;
and &#13;
by an increase &#13;
in &#13;
construction &#13;
as &#13;
private confidence has returned and &#13;
as a result &#13;
of &#13;
increased development assistance. &#13;
Real &#13;
GDP growth was about &#13;
4% &#13;
percent in 2002, &#13;
3 &#13;
Page  5&#13;
more &#13;
than double the &#13;
2001 &#13;
increase &#13;
and, &#13;
more important, &#13;
a &#13;
significant reversal from the falling &#13;
real &#13;
GDP &#13;
in 1999 &#13;
and &#13;
2000. Nevertheless, &#13;
and &#13;
despite &#13;
a &#13;
coffee &#13;
crop in 2002-3 &#13;
that &#13;
was &#13;
more &#13;
than &#13;
twice &#13;
as large as the poor crop of the 2001-2 season, &#13;
export &#13;
revenues have fallen. This &#13;
is &#13;
due &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
first place &#13;
to &#13;
price effects &#13;
(an &#13;
adverse shift in terms of trade &#13;
in &#13;
the sector, &#13;
and &#13;
lower quality as &#13;
coffee plantations were poorly attended due &#13;
to &#13;
the continuing conflict), &#13;
and &#13;
in &#13;
the second place to &#13;
the &#13;
reduction &#13;
in &#13;
recent years &#13;
in &#13;
local capability &#13;
to &#13;
transport the increased volume &#13;
of &#13;
coffee to &#13;
market. Nevertheless, because of &#13;
drought &#13;
conditions &#13;
in &#13;
late &#13;
2002 and &#13;
early 2003, &#13;
it &#13;
is expected &#13;
that agricultural output will fall in 2003, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
GDP &#13;
growth might &#13;
not exceed one percent. &#13;
9. &#13;
Donor Response. &#13;
Following the Arusha &#13;
Accord &#13;
in &#13;
August &#13;
2000, &#13;
an &#13;
international donors &#13;
meeting  called &#13;
by &#13;
President Mandela was &#13;
held &#13;
in December 2000 &#13;
and &#13;
raised  over US$400 &#13;
million. Donors &#13;
met again &#13;
in &#13;
December 2001, &#13;
and &#13;
in April &#13;
2002 &#13;
the I-PRSP &#13;
was &#13;
presented &#13;
and &#13;
endorsed by the donor community &#13;
at &#13;
a &#13;
thematic meeting. &#13;
At &#13;
a &#13;
round-table held &#13;
in &#13;
November &#13;
2002, donors pledged US$981 million &#13;
for &#13;
2003-2005. &#13;
10. &#13;
Problems remain concerning the  service &#13;
and &#13;
eventual reduction of Burundi&#146;s external &#13;
debt, &#13;
whose current &#13;
net &#13;
value amounts to  1,061 &#13;
per cent &#13;
of 2001 exports &#13;
and &#13;
most of which &#13;
(US$149 million) &#13;
is &#13;
in arrears. &#13;
A &#13;
multi-donor debt service trust &#13;
find &#13;
has been established &#13;
but &#13;
to &#13;
date, the contributions are insufficient to cover &#13;
debt &#13;
service &#13;
in &#13;
the medium term even &#13;
to &#13;
permit &#13;
one &#13;
multilateral lender, the African Development Bank, &#13;
to &#13;
resume lending activity. &#13;
11. &#13;
Fiscal developments. &#13;
Overall fiscal performance &#13;
was &#13;
in &#13;
line with the objectives of the &#13;
revised &#13;
budget &#13;
law approved &#13;
in &#13;
August 2002 with assistance &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
IMF. &#13;
Government revenue &#13;
collection was less than projected, mainly due &#13;
to lack &#13;
of &#13;
customs revenue from &#13;
a &#13;
declining level &#13;
of &#13;
imports (next section), but this was more than offset by &#13;
a &#13;
decline &#13;
in &#13;
government expenditure. &#13;
The &#13;
primary budget balance (excluding foreign-financed projects) was more than &#13;
2 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP. &#13;
In &#13;
discussions with the &#13;
IMF &#13;
under the post-conflict assistance program, &#13;
the &#13;
government &#13;
expects in 2003 to maintain &#13;
a &#13;
primary budget  surplus &#13;
of &#13;
1% &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP, while with &#13;
an &#13;
increase &#13;
in &#13;
investment spending the overall deficit excluding grants will increase from &#13;
5 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
to &#13;
10 percent. &#13;
12. &#13;
Fiscal revenues &#13;
are &#13;
expected &#13;
to &#13;
be lower &#13;
in &#13;
2003, with lower excise duties &#13;
on &#13;
beer, likely &#13;
lower domestic transaction tax revenues, &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
decrease in selected import duties &#13;
in &#13;
preparation &#13;
for &#13;
the adoption of the COMESA common external tariff. The system of granting exemptions &#13;
from the turnover &#13;
tax has &#13;
been streamlined, but remaining exemptions continue to distort rates &#13;
of &#13;
effective protection while contributing &#13;
to &#13;
loss &#13;
of potential revenue. &#13;
13. &#13;
The &#13;
2003 budget is designed in accordance with the guidance provided by &#13;
the &#13;
I-PRSP. &#13;
It &#13;
has &#13;
increased the share &#13;
of &#13;
health and education spending from 21 percent &#13;
of &#13;
the budget &#13;
in &#13;
2002 &#13;
to more &#13;
than &#13;
25 percent in 2003. Military spending has been maintained constant in nominal &#13;
terms, implying &#13;
a &#13;
reduction &#13;
of &#13;
0.2 percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
from 2002 to 2003, although demobilization &#13;
expenditures &#13;
in &#13;
2003 &#13;
may lead to &#13;
a &#13;
revision upwards in this budget &#13;
item. &#13;
14. &#13;
On &#13;
the external side, &#13;
the current account deficit narrowed from &#13;
7 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
in &#13;
2001 &#13;
to &#13;
6 &#13;
percent in 2002, despite &#13;
3 &#13;
percent  deterioration &#13;
in &#13;
Burundi&#146;s terms &#13;
of &#13;
trade. This &#13;
improvement was driven by slightly higher coffee exports from the greatly increased harvest as &#13;
described above, &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
decline &#13;
in &#13;
imports due &#13;
to &#13;
low project aid disbursements and &#13;
a &#13;
scarcity &#13;
4 &#13;
Page  6&#13;
of &#13;
foreign exchange throughout much of 2002. External debt payments arrears rose &#13;
to &#13;
US$149 &#13;
million, nearly &#13;
25 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
by &#13;
the end of 2002. &#13;
15. &#13;
Despite &#13;
the &#13;
stagnation  of  export revenues,  the  government  continued  its  program  of &#13;
economic  liberalization.  The  first  tranche  of  IDA&#146;S ERC  for  US$20  million,  released &#13;
in &#13;
November &#13;
2002 &#13;
followed by &#13;
an &#13;
EU program &#13;
grant &#13;
of &#13;
&#128;8 &#13;
million in December, permitted the &#13;
amount &#13;
of &#13;
foreign  exchange  sold &#13;
to &#13;
the private  sector through  the  Central Bank  auction &#13;
to &#13;
increase &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
scale  where &#13;
the &#13;
weekly  auctions  could &#13;
be &#13;
regularized &#13;
and &#13;
the  amount  sold &#13;
standardized. &#13;
The &#13;
positive list of imports eligible for foreign exchange was abolished in August &#13;
2002.  The  foreign  exchange auction mechanism was  changed from &#13;
a &#13;
first-price auction &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
modified &#13;
dutch &#13;
auction  producing &#13;
a &#13;
single, weighted  transaction  rate; &#13;
in &#13;
response  the &#13;
bids &#13;
became &#13;
more &#13;
dispersed. Beginning in January 2003 banks were permitted &#13;
to &#13;
retain &#13;
a &#13;
portion of &#13;
the &#13;
foreign exchange from exports &#13;
(30 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
coffee, tea and cotton sales; &#13;
100 &#13;
percent of &#13;
other  exports),  which  increased  greatly  their  ability  to  provide  foreign  exchange &#13;
to &#13;
their &#13;
customers &#13;
outside the &#13;
auction process &#13;
and &#13;
improved the interbank market, while retaining &#13;
a close &#13;
link by the market to rates &#13;
set &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
auction. Competitiveness was maintained by &#13;
a &#13;
devaluation of &#13;
the  Burundian  franc  by &#13;
20 &#13;
percent &#13;
in &#13;
August  2002,  with &#13;
the &#13;
devaluation  enforced  by &#13;
the &#13;
imposition &#13;
of &#13;
limit prices on the foreign exchange auction. &#13;
IV. &#13;
PROGRESS &#13;
UNDER &#13;
THE &#13;
ERC &#13;
16. &#13;
The ERC &#13;
is &#13;
an integral part &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Bank&#146;s &#13;
Transitional Support Strategy &#13;
to &#13;
support &#13;
the &#13;
transition process and &#13;
the &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the transitional government&#146;s reform program. &#13;
The &#13;
government&#146;s program  seeks &#13;
to &#13;
support poverty reduction  efforts,  increases &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency &#13;
of &#13;
resource allocation &#13;
and &#13;
utilization,  and establish transitional institutions. &#13;
A &#13;
series of measures &#13;
already taken  moved &#13;
the &#13;
government budget  from  deficit  to &#13;
surplus, &#13;
reduced  inflation,  and &#13;
reduced indebtedness &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
banking system. The strategy outlined &#13;
in the &#13;
I-PRSP emphasizes: (i) &#13;
diversification &#13;
of &#13;
sources &#13;
of &#13;
growth and rural income, (ii) macroeconomic stability and economic &#13;
growth,  (iii)  private &#13;
sector &#13;
development,  (iv)  peace,  security &#13;
and &#13;
good  governance, &#13;
(v) &#13;
rehabilitation and reintegration of victims and internally displaced persons, and (vi) strengthening &#13;
human resources &#13;
and &#13;
combating &#13;
HIV/AIDS. &#13;
17. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
period supported by this ERC the Government seeks to &#13;
lay the basis &#13;
for sustainable &#13;
growth &#13;
and &#13;
poverty  reduction  by  establishing &#13;
an &#13;
environment  favorable &#13;
to &#13;
private &#13;
sector &#13;
development, within &#13;
a stable &#13;
macroeconomic framework. &#13;
The objective &#13;
is &#13;
to &#13;
achieve &#13;
a &#13;
real GDP &#13;
growth rate &#13;
of &#13;
5 &#13;
percent &#13;
on &#13;
average over the period 2002-2004,  and at least &#13;
7 &#13;
percent for &#13;
the &#13;
period 2004-2010. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
area of human resources, key reforms &#13;
include &#13;
the reduction &#13;
of &#13;
ethnic, &#13;
regional and gender disparities &#13;
and &#13;
promotion &#13;
of &#13;
inclusion and &#13;
the &#13;
local and community levels, &#13;
and in all &#13;
the &#13;
different branches &#13;
of &#13;
the administration, and rehabilitation of social infrastructure &#13;
coupled  with  improved  access &#13;
to &#13;
social  services. &#13;
The &#13;
Government  intends &#13;
to &#13;
pursue &#13;
a &#13;
privatization strategy that will improve management, &#13;
modernize &#13;
production facilities and &#13;
revive &#13;
output, &#13;
and &#13;
to revive &#13;
the &#13;
coffee and tea subsectors. &#13;
Within the &#13;
administration, &#13;
the &#13;
ERC supports &#13;
strengthening and making transparent &#13;
the &#13;
public procurement administration; &#13;
an &#13;
Auditor General &#13;
(Cow &#13;

The &#13;
ERC  supports  broad  reforms  in  national  reconciliation,  economic  stabilization, &#13;
growth and poverty reduction in &#13;
a &#13;
program supported &#13;
by &#13;
a &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
donors. Implementation &#13;
is &#13;
generally  satisfactory.  As  described  above,  the  government  has  successfully  maintained &#13;
a &#13;
macroeconomic policy framework for growth &#13;
and &#13;
poverty reduction that &#13;
is &#13;
consistent with &#13;
the &#13;
I- &#13;
PRSP &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
objectives of the reform program, one &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
requirements for &#13;
the &#13;
tranche release. &#13;
The &#13;
remainder  of the present memorandum concentrates on specific steps and &#13;
the &#13;
associated &#13;
requirements for tranche release. &#13;

paragraph &#13;
17 &#13;
above) &#13;
is &#13;
on &#13;
track, &#13;
and &#13;
(ii)  the  overall  macroeconomic  environment &#13;
is &#13;
conducive &#13;
to &#13;
sustainable growth &#13;
and &#13;
poverty reduction, as measured on the basis of indicators agreed between &#13;
the &#13;
Government with &#13;
the &#13;
Bank. &#13;
In &#13;
addition,  for release of the  second tranche, the  following &#13;
specific actions should have been undertaken: &#13;

conditions pertaining &#13;
to the &#13;
second tranche &#13;
21. &#13;
Condition &#13;
1 &#13;
- &#13;
Strategic Privatization Plan: &#13;
&#147;Adoption by the Council of Ministers of &#13;
a &#13;
strategic  privatization  plan  acceptable &#13;
to &#13;
IDA,  including  the  establishment &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
unit  to &#13;
implement &#13;
the &#13;
privatization, identification of enterprises to be privatized, and the adoption of &#13;
a &#13;
strategy and plan for privatization &#13;
of &#13;
each.&#148; &#13;
22. &#13;
Background: The &#13;
State &#13;
continues &#13;
to &#13;
be extensively involved &#13;
in &#13;
economic activity through &#13;
State-owned enterprises; &#13;
the &#13;
State has shares in &#13;
48 &#13;
enterprises covering &#13;
10 &#13;
areas of activity. &#13;
In &#13;
general,  these  enterprises  are  inefficient &#13;
and &#13;
heavily  indebted.  The  majority &#13;
of &#13;
enterprises &#13;
involved &#13;
in &#13;
supplying services have benefited from &#13;
a &#13;
de &#13;
jure &#13;
monopoly; &#13;
a &#13;
large number of other &#13;
branches &#13;
and &#13;
sectors &#13;
of &#13;
activity have &#13;
a &#13;
dominant position de facto. &#13;
A &#13;
privatization program was &#13;
initiated in  1991, but &#13;
the &#13;
progress made &#13;
so &#13;
far has been limited, &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
large extent &#13;
due &#13;
to the &#13;
conflict in Burundi; &#13;
0.5 &#13;
per &#13;
cent &#13;
of &#13;
the State&#146;s holdings have been privatized. The Government &#13;
has  drawn &#13;
up &#13;
a &#13;
program  for &#13;
the &#13;
period &#13;
up &#13;
to  2005  for &#13;
the &#13;
full &#13;
or &#13;
partial  privatization &#13;
or &#13;
restructuring  of  19 state  enterprises,  including  those  operating &#13;
in &#13;
certain  key  areas  such  as &#13;
telecommunications and electricity. &#13;
23. &#13;
Action  taken: &#13;
A &#13;
Ministry &#13;
of &#13;
Good Governance and Privatization  has been  created. &#13;
A &#13;
service charged with public  enterprises (SCEP) has been established &#13;
within the &#13;
Ministry. The &#13;
SCEP has  submitted &#13;
a &#13;
detailed program  for privatisation2 to the Council &#13;
of &#13;
Ministers, which &#13;
approved it &#13;
on &#13;
March 25, 2003.3 &#13;
This &#13;
program addresses &#13;
the &#13;
REGIDESO  (potable water and &#13;
electricity), &#13;
ONAPHA &#13;
(pharmaceutical &#13;
manufacture), &#13;
ONATEL &#13;
(telecomm), &#13;
COTEBU &#13;
(textiles), &#13;
OTB &#13;
(tea  marketing), &#13;
SOSUMO &#13;
(sugar),  ALCOVIT  (livestock  feed),  INABU &#13;
(Government printers), OCIBU (coffee marketing), SOGESTAL &#13;
MUMIRWA &#13;
(coffee washing &#13;
station), BRARUDI (brewing), and BCB (banking). &#13;
It &#13;
proposes specific strategic actions for each &#13;
enterprise, along &#13;
with a &#13;
calendar, issues &#13;
to &#13;
be addressed for &#13;
the &#13;
strategy to &#13;
be &#13;
successful, &#13;
and &#13;
an &#13;
estimated cost of the privatisation process recommended. &#13;
The &#13;
staff finds that this condition has &#13;
been satisfactorily met. &#13;

Action taken: A report4 has been completed &#13;
in &#13;
March 2003. &#13;
It &#13;
covers the priorities &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
government expressed in the I-PRSP, the Arusha Accords, &#13;
the &#13;
World Bank&#146;s TSS and the Letter &#13;
of &#13;
Intent given &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
IMF. &#13;
It &#13;
specifically covers the HIPC tracking benchmarks. A new budget &#13;
presentation5 &#13;
has &#13;
been  developed &#13;
to &#13;
reflect these strategies. The staff, having reviewed these, &#13;
finds &#13;
that this &#13;
condition &#13;
has been satisfactorily met. &#13;
27. &#13;
Condition &#13;
3 &#13;
- &#13;
Budget allocation: &#13;
&#147;Agreement with IDA on &#13;
the &#13;
2003 budget allocations &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
priority programs identified in the Interim PRSP and on the system for monitoring budget &#13;
releases to &#13;
the &#13;
priority programs.&#148; &#13;
28. &#13;
Background:  The  Government&#146;s  goal,  given &#13;
in  its &#13;
Letter  of  Development  Policy, &#13;
is &#13;
&#147;Public spending will be stabilized &#13;
at &#13;
around 18.5 percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
during the period 2002-2004, &#13;
while budget allocations &#13;
to &#13;
priority sectors &#13;
such &#13;
as health, education, water and sanitation will &#13;
be &#13;
increased.&#148; &#13;
29. &#13;
Action  taken:  The  budget  recommendations  developed  under &#13;
the &#13;
I-PRSP6 propose &#13;
allocations by &#13;
sector &#13;
for the 2002 &#13;
and &#13;
2003 budget, together with a detailed breakdown &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
pro-poor expenditures budgeted. The Bank staff has reviewed this. Also, the IMF staff report on &#13;
the post-conflict  emergency assistance request (op. cit., &#13;
para &#13;
22.) concludes, &#147;the &#13;
2003 &#13;
budget &#13;
provides for significant increases in allocations for &#13;
the social &#13;
sectors, while raising &#13;
civil &#13;
services &#13;
wages substantially. The share &#13;
of &#13;
health and education spending &#13;
in &#13;
current expenditure has been &#13;
raised from 21 percent in 2002 &#13;
to &#13;
more than &#13;
25 &#13;
percent &#13;
in &#13;
2003. &#13;
An &#13;
additional &#13;
1,700 &#13;
teachers &#13;
have  been  hired,  mostly  for  primary  education.  Military  spending  has  been  kept  broadly &#13;
unchanged &#13;
in  nominal &#13;
terms,  which  implies  a  reduction  by &#13;
0.2 &#13;
percentage  point  of  GDP &#13;
compared with 2002. &#13;
... &#13;
The strong increase &#13;
in &#13;
public investment in 2003 &#13;
is &#13;
expected &#13;
to &#13;
help &#13;
rebuild  and  develop  infrastructures,  as  well  as  support &#13;
the &#13;
economic  recovery  and  poverty &#13;
reduction  through  labor-intensive  projects.&#148;  The  staff  finds  that  this  condition  has  been &#13;
satisfactorily met. &#13;

            Project : Second Tranche Release
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            On August 29, 2002, the Executive
            Directors approved an Economic Rehabilitation Credit (ERC)
            of SDR 40.8 million to the Republic of Burundi. The ERC is
            an integral part of the Bank's Transitional Support
            Strategy (TSS) discussed by the Board on March 7, 2002, to
            support the transition process and the implementation of the
            Government's reform program. The Credit was declared
            effective on October 23, 2002, and the first tranche, was
            released upon effectiveness. A second tranche was to be made
            available for disbursement upon liberalization of the
            Borrower's foreign exchange system and fulfillment of
            budget-related conditions for that tranche described in this
            memorandum, and a third and final tranche, was to be made
            available for disbursement upon fulfillment of the
            conditions for that tranche. This memorandum informs
            Executive Directors that the Second Tranche has been made
            available for disbursement. This memorandum summarizes these
            reviews and reports on the actions taken by the Government.
            It concludes that: (a) the macroeconomic policy framework
            for growth and poverty reduction is consistent with the
            objectives of the reform program; (b) satisfactory progress
            has been achieved in the overall execution of the program;
            and (c) all specific conditions pertaining to the release of
            the Second Tranche have been met.
