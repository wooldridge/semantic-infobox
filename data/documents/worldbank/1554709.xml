Abstract&#13;
The paper analyzes the efficiency of several tax-contract systems,&#13;
such as the resource rent tax, production share system, and royalty. Account&#13;
is taken of their incentive effects on behavior of firms under different&#13;
economic and geological conditions, with particular emphasis on areas where&#13;
prospects are relatively poor. The paper shows the strengths and weaknesses&#13;
of systems widely used or recommended for oil exploration and production in&#13;
developing countries. An analysis of the problem of nationalization risk is&#13;
also carried out, and some light shed on which of these systems is best able&#13;
to cope with this problem.&#13;

1.       INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1      The Background&#13;
The oil price increases of the seventies had a strong effect on&#13;
developing countries as a vast majority (92) of them depended in varying&#13;
degrees on imported oil. Among these were 64 countries, including some of the&#13;
poorest, that depended on imports for more than 75% of their commercial&#13;
supplies 1/. The short term impact on their import bill and consequently on&#13;
their balance of payments heightened their interest in oil exploration and&#13;
production. The World Bank's support for exploitation of energy resources,&#13;
and the financial resources, required for the purpose, was noted in a 1979&#13;
paper titled, "A Program to Accelerate Petroleum Production in Developing&#13;
Countries".&#13;
The historical pattern of exploration activity has been heavily&#13;
concentrated in North America and the Middle East. Though the rise in oil&#13;
prices was expected to accelerate private exploitation-production activity,&#13;
there was no reasons to expect that the relative emphasis on areas of&#13;
historically large production would change. The evidence of exploration&#13;
activity seems to bear this out. As stated in the World Bank Report (1983),&#13;
"The Energy Transition in Developing Countries":&#13;
"... despite the rise in the price of oil, over the past decade there has&#13;
been little increase in exploration activity in most developing&#13;
countries...while exploration in the oil importing developing countries&#13;
(OIDCs) as a group expanded between 1972 and 1980, it did not increase&#13;
relative to worldwide activity. Moreover, virtually all of the increase&#13;
1/ "Energy in Developing Countries, World Bank, August 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in activity has been concentrated in the petroleum producing OIDCs and the&#13;
share of nonproducing importing countries in total drilling has declined&#13;
considerably since 1972. The expanded programs of national oil companies&#13;
in three countries - Argentina, Brazil, and India - alone account for&#13;
almost 60 percent of the increase in exploratory drilling in all oil&#13;
importing developing countries over the period."&#13;
Part of the reason stated in the 1979 report (op.cit.), which gave the&#13;
conclusions of a survey of 70 countries as follows: 1/&#13;
"The survey also concluded that in about 50 of the countries surveyed the&#13;
government or the state oil company urgently need help in a variety of&#13;
training and institution building activities. Most of these countries&#13;
need advice in framing or amending legislation relating to the energy&#13;
sector, or in adapting policies and procedures that would improve the&#13;
prospects of cooperation with foreign prospecting the production&#13;

The World Bank's inducement with respect to tax contract arrangements, was&#13;
summarised by a 1983 report as follows: 2/:&#13;
The Bank has therefore consistently advised governments to be pragmatic,&#13;
making their acreage competitive; while ensuring that returns would be&#13;
shared satisfactorily under different circumstances. Most of the Bank's&#13;
exploration promotion projects provide for experts to advise the&#13;
government on petroleum laws, contracts and negotiations, and help build&#13;

mutual confidence between the International Oil Conferences and the host&#13;
country. The Bank has also concerned itself directly with some of the&#13;
more significant issues in these areas and developed or promoted new&#13;
alternatives. For example, it has encouraged the consideration of fiscal&#13;
systems which, in accordance with a predetermined or negotiated formula,&#13;
adjust government revenues in direct relation to the IOC's actual profits&#13;
as measured by its discounted cash flow return on investment. Private&#13;
firms are, of course, not only concerned about the investment framework at&#13;
a particular point in time but also in its likely stability over 10-15&#13;
years. The Bank has developed several instruments to ensure its presence&#13;
during exploration, mainly to limit private investors' perceptions of&#13;
political risk.&#13;
1.2 The Problem&#13;
In simple terms, the problem is to select tax-contract policies which&#13;
I provide sufficient incentivej for foreign firms to explore for and extract the&#13;
resource, while retaining as much of the resource rent for the developing&#13;
country (owner government) as possible. Though this problem has some elements&#13;
of the general problem of attracting foreign investment, it is different in&#13;
several important ways. For any given natural resource tract, with fixed&#13;
known reserves, production at different points in time is interlinked because&#13;
of the exhaustibility of the stock. Therefore, the level of production and&#13;
net returns at any point in time are a substitute for those at a different&#13;
point in time.  A second related difference is the existence of (a3e3ent.&#13;
Finally, and more importantly, before the start of exploration the amount of&#13;
resource present, or even whether it exists at all is uncertain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Tax-contract policy has to be decided before the existence of the&#13;
resource, or its size if present is known with some degree of certainty.&#13;
Formally, exploration-extraction contracts are, of course, signed before&#13;
exploration begins. Tax liability is also often defined within the&#13;
contract. If it is not the effect may be worse, as any possibility that tax&#13;
terms may be arbitrarily changed after resource discovery has to be taken&#13;
account of by the firms. The tax-contract system, under which a foreign firm&#13;
agrees to exploit a natural resource tract, is effectively a Scheme for&#13;
Sharing the Total Return from the project. At the time of entry, these&#13;
consist of the opportunity cost of the capital that the firm will invest, the&#13;
returns to the risk it will take, and the unknown rent that will accrue from&#13;
the tract. The tax-contract system implicitly defines how each level of&#13;
returns (positive and negative) which emerge after exploration and production&#13;
are to be divided between the firm and the government. Different schemes have&#13;
different effects on the firm's choice of a pattern of development and&#13;
production if a resource discovery is made. That is they provide a different&#13;
structure of incentives to the contracting firm. This, in turn, affects both&#13;
the total returns from the project and the rents which can be obtained from&#13;
it. In economic terms, therefore, the problem is to select and/or design an&#13;
efficient tax-contract system for obtaining the rent element of the resource&#13;
under conditions of resource uncertainty.&#13;
Inherent in the process of exploration for a natural resource in a&#13;
given tract is the possibility of a change in the value that the firm and&#13;
government assign to the tract before and after exploration. This gives rise&#13;
to the possibility that one of the parties may want to change the (explicit or&#13;
implicit) terms after exploration is completed, if the penalties for so doing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
are low. Included in this is the risk of expropriation. The problem of&#13;
Sovereign Risk (government changing contract terms) is of particular relevance&#13;
to less developed countries, and is very important as it effects the perceived&#13;
risk of the foreign firms and the terms they may be willing to offer.&#13;
The present research is aimed at providing an efficiency ranking of&#13;
different tax-contract systems commonl    used in d     pgcQi     Lrjes.   The&#13;
idea was t   determine the          under      rsoge              g      aLd&#13;
e                ns.   Of particular interest were geologic conditions under&#13;
which there is low perceived probability of finding the resource. The&#13;
hypothesis was that even though the actual rates which are fixed under any&#13;
given scheme were likely to be very sensitive to basic conditions, some&#13;
regularities should emerge in the efficiency ranking of the schemes&#13;
themselves. Separate work also explores how tax-contract forms may reduce&#13;
sovereign risk, and consequently increase the (ex-ante) benefits to both&#13;
parties. An evaluation of the extent to which the different tax-contract&#13;
arrangements ranked previously, meet the sovereign risk reducing criteria&#13;
derived analytically is also carried out. Though the simulation work is&#13;
focussed on Petroleum Resources, it also sheds some light on the more general&#13;
problem of taxation of foreign companies involved in exploration and&#13;
production of other exhaustible resources.&#13;
1.3 Relationship to Earlier Work&#13;
A common approach in comparing petroleum contracts has been to show&#13;
the pattern of returns (to firm and government) that they produce on a few&#13;
illustrative projects [see for e.g. Garnaut and Ross (1983)]. These patterns&#13;
of return are then compared with respect to different criteria. Each tax-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
contract system compared is characterized by a fixed pattern of rates (i.e. a&#13;
specific rate structure). More importantly the illustrative project has not&#13;
only a fixed known resource amount, but also a fixed level and structure of&#13;
costs and production. Such comparisons can only capture two sets of economic&#13;
effects. One is changes in stopping time, or the time at which after tax&#13;
revenue from declining oil flows become less than net operating costs. Thus a&#13;
system like royalty which only taxes output will lower marginal revenue and&#13;
advance the stopping time. This will result in more oil being left&#13;
unextracted and lower total project return. The second is the effect of the&#13;
tax on development of a marginal field. Thus a neutral tax will not affect&#13;
the decision of whether or not to develop a marginal field. Non-neutral taxes&#13;
will tend to result in nondevelopment of marginal fields, again reducing&#13;
returns.&#13;
Though the theoretical literature on taxation of natural resources is&#13;
quite limited, it shows clearly that the most important effect is to change&#13;
the intertemporal pattern of production. Among these are the papers by&#13;
Dasgupta, Heal and Stiglitz (1981), a chapter in the book by Dasgupta and Heal&#13;
(1979), and a recent one by Gamponia and Mendelshon (1985). These papers&#13;
analyse the effect of various types of taxes on the intertemporal allocation&#13;
of a  Pwn exhaustible resource stock.    The equilibrium (Hotelling) condition&#13;
is used to trace the effect of the tax on the initial price and the&#13;
intertemporal price path of the resource. Given a demand function for the&#13;
industry this determines the pattern of demand over time and consequently the&#13;
pattern of extraction. This analysis shows that a specific sales tax or a&#13;
royalty will shift the pattern of exploitation towards the future. Given the&#13;
simplified nature of the model a pure profit tax or rent tax is easily defined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and shown to be neutral in its effects on extraction. Though this analysis&#13;
provides a useful starting point, there is an important difference from the&#13;
problem addressed in the present paper. In the theoretical analysis, the tax&#13;
applies to the entire industry.   In the present case we are consid&#13;
situation in which the government-wants-t-o ve-r6p-atair-cortract-a-rrangemer-t&#13;
for leasing one or more tracts of land for exploration-development. Any&#13;
potential resource discoveries are likely to be a small proportion of total&#13;
reserves. The tax-contract arrangements therefore apply to a small segment of&#13;
the markets, and the price path can be treated as exogenous.&#13;
Two other assumptions of the theoretical analysis, become important&#13;
limitations in the context of the present problem. One is the assumption of&#13;
fixed known resource. When the tax-contract arrangements are defined, it is&#13;
not known how much resource exists, or even whether any resource will be found&#13;
at all. We can conceive of this resource uncertainty as being resolved during&#13;
the exploration stage. Implicitly therefore, the theoretical analysis&#13;
mentioned deals only with production stage. Even though separate theoretical&#13;
analysis deals with the effect of uncertainty on exploration, a critical&#13;
element of the tax-contract problem is resource uncertainty and consequent&#13;
uncertainty in rents. These two stages have therefore to be integrated into a&#13;
single framework.&#13;
The other:assumption is that costs of extraction are constant at all&#13;
points in time and independent of the amount extracted at a given point in&#13;
time. In other words the amount of resource extracted at any time can be&#13;
varied up or down without any change in unit costs. This seems unreasonable&#13;
for extraction from a given track, where geologic constraints greatly limits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
the flexibility of extraction. Though constant costs may be a useful&#13;
abstraction for defining equilibrium.&#13;
A modeling framework which addresses these problems, and is therefore&#13;
more suited to the present paper, is that used by Kalter, Tyner and Hughes&#13;
(1975, KTH hereafter). As the analysis deals with leasing of tracts for&#13;
exploration and development,, prices (or their distribution) are exogenously&#13;
specified. The important sources of resource uncertainty, as well as those&#13;
relating to costs and prices can be dealt with in a Monte-Carlo simulation&#13;
framework. If a resource is found and developed, the production profile after&#13;
field development is constrained by field pressure characteristic.&#13;
The KTH paper analyses the Bonus bidding system in the context of US&#13;
Offshore Continental Shelf leasing. It also explores various innovations&#13;
which could be introduced into the basic bonus bidding system. The systems,&#13;
of greatest importance to the developing countries were not analysed.     Tyner&#13;
(1978) using an extension of this model to compare several contract systems.&#13;
The specific schedules and rates used in the countries in which these systems&#13;
are in use, were applied to Indian conditions.&#13;
The present paper uses the GEN2 version of the model used by Tyner as&#13;
the basic model (referred to hereafter as the Gen2 model). Some of the&#13;
modifications and extensions introduced into the model will be discussed in&#13;
the next section. The major new thrust of the present paper is to compare&#13;
tax-contract systems rather than specific schedules of rates. An analogy from&#13;
tax theory may be useful. The traditional procedure is analogous to taking&#13;
the tax schedules (say with respect to indirect taxes) of countries A, B and C&#13;
and comparing the inefficiency caused and revenues raised when each is applied&#13;
in one country (say A). The procedure of modern tax theory is to define&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
equivalent tax systems by some condition such as equal revenue yield. Their&#13;
relative impact on efficiency (and equity) can then be judged. In the present&#13;
paper the tax-contract arrangement has to be made before exploration takes&#13;
place, and resource uncertainty is an essential part of the problem. We&#13;
therefore define equivalence between different systems under consideration, in&#13;
terms of attainment of equal expected profits by competing firms, under each&#13;
scheme. 1/. This allows us to compare the impact of different systems on the&#13;
efficiency of rent collection by government and on its risk sharing/sovereign&#13;
risk reducing properties, under different 'geological and economic&#13;
conditions. 2/&#13;
2. Modeling Framework and Methodology&#13;
2.1      The External Environment:   Home Taxes&#13;
As noted earlier, given the developing country focus of this paper,&#13;
we are interested primarily in tax-contract arrangements for foreign&#13;
companies; local companies are overwhelmingly, government companies for which&#13;
this issue is not relevant, as all exploration-production decisions can in&#13;
effect, be taken directly by the government. The nature of the tax treatment&#13;
of earnings in the developing (or host) country by their home country will in&#13;
general affect their actions in the latter. The paper therefore introduces a&#13;
provision for home country taxation of the firms.&#13;
1/ Actually we use a zero expected rent (or) pure profit condition, but this&#13;
does not effect the generality of the results.&#13;
2/ Technically the problem is to choose a scheme which maximizes expectation&#13;
of government discounted revenue, subject to the firms expectation of the&#13;
present value of profits being above a specified level. Practically, all&#13;
we can do is rank different schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
There are two broad ways in which home countries treat host country&#13;
taxes. In the deduction method, which appears to be more common, host country&#13;
taxes are treated as a deduction. Home country taxes therefore apply to net&#13;
income after host country taxes. In the credit method most widely used in the&#13;
US, home country tax liability is assessed on gross income, and a credit given&#13;
for taxes paid in the host country. In both these cases we assume that the&#13;
other income of these companies is sufficient to claim full deduction/credit&#13;
if a loss is incurred in the host country. If some kind of double taxation&#13;
agreement exists between the home and the host country these taxes may of&#13;
course be zero. In either case, for the purpose of tax-contract design this&#13;
aspect of the external environment of the firm and the host government are&#13;
assumed to be exogenously given.&#13;
2.2 The Host Country Environment: Tax-Contract System&#13;
Within this external environment, the host governments problem is to&#13;
choose a tax-contract system, under which the firm will operate. Most&#13;
developing countries have an income tax which applies to both domestic and&#13;
foreign companies. In many cases, however, the contract between foreign oil&#13;
companies and the country excludes any income tax liability under the normal&#13;
system. To be able to consider both possibilities, we provide for a possible&#13;
income tax. The common form of income tax with loss-carry forward provisions&#13;
is used. I'&#13;
1/ This was substituted for the full-loss offset type of system present in&#13;
the Gen 2 model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The contractual systems used in developing countries include the&#13;
Production Share System (PDS), 11 Severance tax or Royalty (ROY), and various&#13;
forms of participation (PART). Another system which is of importance is the&#13;
Resource Rent Tax (RRT) a form of which has been suggested to foreign firms&#13;
and host governments by the World Bank Energy department. Both the PDS and&#13;
the RRT involve many different levels of Government Share/Tax rates whose&#13;
perceived objective is to make the system progressive.&#13;
The Royalty system is essentially like a sales tax, as it involves a&#13;
tax on value of output. Though a progressive system of royalty rates, with&#13;
marginal rates rising with value of output, is possible, it is not very&#13;
common. The Production Share System, and its variants, is the most commonly&#13;
used system in LDCs. Its essential elements are as follows. The exploration&#13;
and development costs incurred before production starts are added up and&#13;
carried forward. Once production starts the value of total output is divided&#13;
between "Profit Oil" and "Cost Oil" according to a prespecified factor termed&#13;
the "Cost Factor." Current costs as well as past costs can be reimbursed to&#13;
the company from the cost oil. There is a further limitation, however, that&#13;
the past costs cannot be deducted in time less than NYCT, referred to as the&#13;
minimum time for cost recovery. Profit oil is in general shared under a&#13;
progressive system of sharing, where the shift to higher levels of implicit&#13;
taxation depends on the level of output. 2/&#13;
The Resource Rent Tax is also a fairly complicated system defined in&#13;
terms of "threshold rates" of return. No tax is levied below the lowest&#13;
threshold (CRATS) so that the government gets no revenues if the rate of&#13;
I/ Often referred to as the Indonesian or Indian System.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
return to the firm's capital investment is less than CRAT1. For fields with&#13;
higher return, the first level of tax begins to apply at any point in time at&#13;
which the internal rate of return calculated to that point exceeds the first&#13;
threshold. This has the effect of allowing firms to carry forward all costs&#13;
incurred at a rate of interest CRAT1, and to deduct these from current profits&#13;
after start of production. The next level of tax is added on to the first,&#13;
when the internal rate of return net of the first level tax exceeds CRAT2, the&#13;
second threshold rate.&#13;
In general each system can be thought of as characterised by a number&#13;
of parameters. Thus for example a production Share System (PDS) consists of a&#13;
series of production levels at which different sharing rates apply, as well as&#13;
a number of other parameters like the cost factor. If leasing is carried out&#13;
through auction or bidding, most of these sharing rates can also be treated as&#13;
parameters, as bidding takes place on only one of these rates.l/ Negotiation&#13;
may involve one or more rates and the set of these rates can be referred to as&#13;
the rate schedule. All the rest are included in the parametric definition of&#13;
the contract system, and any charge in these parameters (therefore)&#13;
constitutes a variant of the basic system. The host government determines the&#13;
contract system or its variant which will be used, and the precise rates or&#13;
rate schedule to be used is determined by competition between the firms. For&#13;
expositional simplicity it is convenient to think of one rate as being&#13;
determined in this way.&#13;
For the purpose of the present analysis we assume all competing firms&#13;
are identical, and have the same information and expectation about geologic&#13;
1/ Even theoretical bidding systems seldom involve more than two bid&#13;
variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
conditions and economic factors which effect profitability. 1/ In this paper&#13;
it is implicitly assumed that firms maximize expected present value of&#13;
profits. 2/ If perfect competition prevailed in the market for leases, this&#13;
would result in a sharing rate (or rate schedule) for which firms' expected&#13;
(pure) profits or expected rent share from the natural resource was zero.&#13;
Comparison of different systems (including system variants) therefore involves&#13;
determining the rate at which firms' expected profits would be zero, given all&#13;
the geological and economic factors affecting the firms' decisions. The&#13;
systems can then be ordered in terms of the present value of governments'&#13;
total revenues from the lease, for each set of geologic - economic conditions.&#13;
Noncompetitive market conditions can be incorporated within this&#13;
methodology, by allowing for any fixed positive level of expected (pure)&#13;
profits. The implicit assumption in this case is that a change in the system&#13;
used does not effect the oligopolistic (or other noncompetitive) interaction&#13;
between the firms, in such a way as to change the minimum expected (pure)&#13;
profits required by firms to take a lease. As the nature of our results is&#13;
unaffected by the assumption of a positive expected (pure) profit condition,&#13;
the exposition will be in terms of zero expected rents.&#13;
2.3      Firm Optimising Decisions&#13;
Consider a tax-contract system and its associated rate variable. For&#13;
each level of this rate firms must look forward into time to consider what&#13;
1/ The assumption eliminates most of the factors which are important in the&#13;
theoretical analysis of bidding behavior.&#13;
2/ The model with expected utility maximization has been completed, but is&#13;
not the subject of this paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
would happen if they took the lease. In simplified terms, we can think of two&#13;
stages. In the first stage the firm spends a certain amount of money in&#13;
exploration, and determines whether any natural resource exists, and if so how&#13;
much. At the start of this stage, the firms must therefore have an idea of&#13;
the probability of a resource discovery, and the conditional probability&#13;
distribution of the volume of the resource. In our analysis we assume that&#13;
exploration costs are a known fixed amount 1/, though they may be related to&#13;
the expected value of the resource. The existence of a home income tax system&#13;
affects the net (after tax) cost of exploration.&#13;
The second stage may be termed the Development-Production stage. If&#13;
no resource is found, this stage is of course absent. If a resource is found,&#13;
the firm must plan its development. The critical optimizing decisions&#13;
analysed in this paper take place at the beginning of this stage. Given its&#13;
expectations about future costs and prices, the geologic constraints and the&#13;
tax-contract arrangements, the firm chooses a peak production level (Qo), to&#13;
maximize expected after tax net present value of profits (ATNPV). The choice&#13;
of peak production level determines both the development cost for the field,&#13;
and its production profile after start of production.&#13;
Choice of a peak capacity level (for the resource discovered) is&#13;
assumed to fix the output profile for future periods. Though this is a&#13;
significant simplifying assumption, a plausible justification can be given.&#13;
Once the field has been developed and the pattern of wells and infrastructural&#13;
facilities laid down, it is quite costly to increase the capacity of the&#13;
1/ Most developing country oil contracts include a provision that the&#13;
expected amount of exploration expenditures will be carried out. This&#13;
assumption is therefore almost literally true in such countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
field. It is seldom done unless there is a major exogenous shock. Though a&#13;
reduction in output in any given period is relatively easy (by reducing&#13;
outflow from wells) most developing country contracts require that production&#13;
be maintained at levels consistent with "good oil field practice". It is&#13;
therefore contractually difficult to reduce output when conditions are&#13;
temporarily unfavorable.&#13;
Figure 1 gives three different ways in which the production profile&#13;
can be represented. All these are based on geophysical concepts of the nature&#13;
of decline in the pressure at the well-head(s) as the volume of recoverable&#13;
oil in the reservoir declines. Figure l(a) gives the profile used in the Gen&#13;
2 model which forms the starting point of the analysis.    Both the period of&#13;
time over which there is no significant pressure decline and the rate of&#13;
decline in production once pressure begins to decline are independent of peak&#13;
capacity and reserve size (important for Monte Carlo experiments) A rise in&#13;
peak capacity from Qol to Q02 raises production at every moment in time,&#13;
except that resource exhaustion takes place earlier - at Te2 instead of at&#13;
Tel* This profile does capture the pattern of oil flow decline from a given&#13;
field, but the feasible changes which would result from tax changes appear&#13;
less consistent with the literature. Figure l(b) shows a pattern which has&#13;
been used by the MIT modeling group and others in supply models. In this case&#13;
production starts declining instantaneously, and there is no steady output&#13;
period. A rise in peak capacity results in faster production decline, with&#13;
total resource extractable remaining constant. This pattern is consistent&#13;
with the tax literature, but appears somewhat restrictive from the geological&#13;
perspective.&#13;

Figure l(c) represents an adaptation of these two approaches to give&#13;
a more general and realistic view used in the present analysis. This is&#13;
designed to approximate a situation in which pressure/production decline is an&#13;
inverted S curve as in l(a); Production declines slowly with full reserves,&#13;
and then accelerates. It is much more realistic to assume, that as peak&#13;
production is raised the time for which production can be maintained at this&#13;
level falls, and the rate at which production subsequently declines,&#13;
increases. Total recoverable reserves (area under curve) are held constant as&#13;
in l(b). 1/&#13;
Development costs per unit of peak capacity are assumed to be&#13;
constant. Provision was also made for a quadratic cost function around a base&#13;
value, but the results reported are for the former case. 2/ More importantly&#13;
the Gen 2 model makes no provision for these costs to change with size of&#13;
reserve discovered (in a Monte Carlo simulation). The KTH analysis of primary&#13;
data showed however that costs per unit of peak capacity rise less than&#13;
proportionately with reserves discovered. 3/ The present model introduced&#13;
this directly into the model. Total development costs as calculated, are then&#13;
distributed over the development period in prespecified proportions.&#13;
1/  Area under flat portion (FLATP)   R  = 6.R    = Q . FLATP&#13;
R is the reserve size and 6 is a geologic cons?ant (6&lt;1). If&#13;
6=0 the profile reduces to that in l(b).&#13;
2/  It is very difficult to combine this function with variation of costs with&#13;
reserves. Lack of detailed data also prevents a useful representation of&#13;
the relationship.&#13;
3/ They show that the relationship is given by C = aRb where C is the cost&#13;
per unit of peak capacity a &gt; o, b &lt; o are constants, and R is the&#13;
reserve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
The contracting firms chooses peak capacity (Qo) to maximize its&#13;
after tax net present value (ATNPV). That is net of contractual payments to&#13;
the host government and of tax payments to the home government. 1/ For a&#13;
small high cost field the net ATNPV may be greater if the field is not&#13;
developed. Such a field will not be developed under the given tax-contract&#13;
system. This is of course affected by the type of tax-contract system used.&#13;
For fields which are developed, the choice of peak capacity also determines&#13;
the stream of revenues obtained by the host government. These may be&#13;
discounted by the government at a rate which differs from that of the firm.&#13;
To summarize, at the beginning of the second stage the firm determines its&#13;
optimal peak capacity for the amount of resource discovered, and this&#13;
determines its expected after tax net present value and the government&#13;
expected present value of revenues (PVGVRV), conditional on that reserve size.&#13;
The firm then combines the two stages to determine its expected after&#13;
tax net present value at the beginning of stage 1; i.e. given the uncertainty&#13;
in resource discovery. The firm will only take the lease if this value is&#13;
non-negative. .2/ For each system, the variable tax rate can be changed to&#13;
determine the critical tax/share at which this value is zero. This determines&#13;
the rent collection by the government under comparable conditions. Relative&#13;
efficiency is then determined by comparing PVGVRV under different systems, for&#13;
a fixed set of geological and economic conditions.&#13;
1/ In the simulation model this is actually carried out by choosing the&#13;
period of flat production FLATP (or T ). As this is a discrete number,&#13;
care has to be exercised in comparing cases in which FLATP differs by one.&#13;

2.4 The Resource Rent Tax (RRT)&#13;
As this is probably the least familiar system, a brief additional&#13;
discussion is useful. There are two characteristics of the resource industry,&#13;
which set it apart from other industry. One is the existence of rents. If&#13;
the resource amounts were known with certainty, these rents could in principle&#13;
be calculated and appropriated by the resource owner by applying a 100% tax,&#13;
without affecting efficiency of resource extraction. In practice, however,&#13;
any feasible tax gives rise to serious incentive problems at tax values&#13;
approaching 100%. The other characteristic is the uncertainty about existence&#13;
of, and in the amount of the resource, when the tax contract arrangements are&#13;
made. As risk taking entails a real cost to the firm, this must be accounted&#13;
for in determining resource rent. The interaction of these two factors means&#13;
that defining a practicable resource rent tax is not easy.&#13;
R. Garnaut and Clunis Ross (1975) suggested a practical method for&#13;
taxing excess profits or rents in the resource context 1/. They defined a&#13;
series of "threshold rates" of return 2/. The pure profits tax is zero below&#13;
the lowest threshold. As higher internal rates of return are achieved, the&#13;
tax liability rises, and after each threshold is reached a different marginal&#13;
tax rate is applied. The gross tax rate on higher earnings is the sum of&#13;
individual marginal tax rates. This means, that the tax rate gradually&#13;
approaches 100%, but never actually reaches it. These threshold rates are an&#13;
attempt to deal with the two problems outlined earlier: The difficulty in&#13;
determining the critical rates of return which would just draw firms into&#13;
1/ It has also been analysed by Ross (1977 a, b), Palmer (1980) and others.&#13;

investing in exploration, and the disincentive affects of a 100% tax rate&#13;
above this critical rate.&#13;
An important practical difference from other systems is that&#13;
exploration and development costs incurred before start of production (and&#13;
even beyond if needed) are carried forward with interest (at CRAT1). These&#13;
are fully deductible from current profits once production starts. The other&#13;
difference is that the progressivity of the system is implicitly defined in&#13;
terms of internal rates of return levels rather than in terms of output levels&#13;
as in PDS, and Variable Royalty.&#13;
3. Comparison of Systems&#13;
An extensive series of tests and simulations were run on different types&#13;
of fields and for both the certainty and Monte Carlo cases. The pattern of&#13;
results was basically the same across all these experiments. We report,&#13;
therefore, mainly on the Monte Carlo results for the field with a mean reserve&#13;
of 100 million barrels. The strategy of research was to start with simplified&#13;
versions of the relevant systems and understand their implications. In most&#13;
cases, for example, the Production Share System of the India-Indonesia type&#13;
and the Resource Rent tax, this meant keeping only one level of&#13;
taxation/sharing. Unless otherwise specified, no income tax is applicable.&#13;
Base case values were assumed for economic and geological&#13;
parameters. As the conventional analysis ignores home country taxes two base&#13;
cases were defined: One with no home country taxes, and one with a positive&#13;
level of home country taxes. Sensitivity testing was done using variations of&#13;
30% or more in individual parameters.&#13;
&#13;

3.1 Ordering of Single Rate Systems&#13;
The value of a resource of a given size depends both on the&#13;
geological and on the economic conditions, and so does its expected value&#13;
under uncertainty. To adjust for this scaling effect, a neutral system was&#13;
defined, which does not distort the production-development decision. This is&#13;
a participation system (PART), in which everything except exploration costs&#13;
are shared in proportion. 1/ The nonsharing of exploration costs considerably&#13;
simplifies all our calculations and does not affect comparison of the systems&#13;
which are of primary interest. The zero expected profit tax rate under each&#13;
system is determined as outlined earlier. The total expected government&#13;
revenues conditional on a resource being found are then compared with those&#13;
under PART, and the efficiency loss determined for each system.&#13;
Table 1 presents the data for the base case with no home government&#13;
taxes. The column headed PVGVRV gives these efficiency losses. The set of&#13;
data on the left shows these loses for the case in which probability of&#13;
resource discovery is 0.1. The best system is shown to be the RRT with&#13;
cumulation rate (CRAT) of 6%, the rate which is the same as the discount rate&#13;
of the firm. 2/ The worst system is also an RRT system, but with the much&#13;
higher threshold/cumulation rate of 15%. In this case the firm pays nothing&#13;
to the government for any field (discovered) which has a rate of return of&#13;
less then 15%.&#13;
1/ Simiiar participation systems have been used in certain countries such as&#13;
Brazil. Most of these seem to have been modified to look more like the&#13;
PDS.&#13;
2/ Actually because of slight difference in the way in which discounting is&#13;
done the equivalent CRAT is probably slightly higher than 6%.&#13;

In the middle, somewhat worse than the RRT06 system, we find systems&#13;
such as the pure income tax, the production share system and a version of the&#13;
profit share system (not shown). Significantly worse than these but better&#13;
than the RRT15 are the pure royalty and the British Petroleum revenue tax.&#13;
For interpreting these and subsequent results it is useful to review&#13;
the economics of these systems. In the theoretical analysis reviewed earlier,&#13;
Dasgupta and Heal showed that for a given fixed reserve size, a royalty would&#13;
tend to reduce output in earlier periods and push it to later periods. In&#13;
terms of the present model this is equivalent to a fall in peak capacity (Qo)&#13;
and an increase in the period of flat production (FLATP). In the context of&#13;
uncertain reserve size the mean/average period of flat production is an&#13;
approximate measure of this effect, and is shown under column headed To. The&#13;
major systems ordered in terms of increasing To are; RRT15, RRT06, PDS and&#13;
ROY.  Comparing with the   T   for PART, we find that on average RRT15 (and PRT)&#13;
tends to accelerate the extraction of oil, PDS and ROY (and IT) tend to&#13;
decelerate it, and RRT06 is approximately neutral.&#13;
In the Royalty system, the host government is in effect taxing the&#13;
firm's revenues, without taking any account of costs. There is therefore an&#13;
incentive for the firm to reduce costs as much as possible. This it does by&#13;
reducing peak capacity. From Figure l(c), page 16, it is apparent that this&#13;
will lengthen the flat period and shift extraction from earlier to later&#13;
periods. A simplistic way of comparing the different systems is as follows:&#13;
Discounted profits from a given resource are equal to the discounted revenues&#13;
minus the discounted costs. These two can be depicted as functions of the&#13;
peak capacity as in Figure 2(a). Imposition of a royalty rotates the revenue&#13;

function down while leaving net costs unchanged. This results in a decrease&#13;
of optimum peak capacity from    QO to QROY (and an increase in FLATP).&#13;
In the production share system, and in the simple income tax (and in&#13;
different types of profit share systems), an attempt is made to tax profits.&#13;
Once production starts the tax applies to the difference between revenues and&#13;
operational costs. Exploration costs and most development costs are however&#13;
incurred in periods before production starts. The cost carry forward&#13;
provisions and deductions for tangible costs do not compensate fully for the&#13;
effective costs. Though the incentive for reducing costs by lowering peak&#13;
capacity is reduced, it is not eliminated. Therefore the period of flat&#13;
production (and T ) increases less than in the case of royalty. This is&#13;
depicted in Figure 2(b), with the downward rotation of the cost function being&#13;
less than that of the revenue function. This system therefore has a smaller&#13;
efficiency loss than the pure royalty.&#13;
In practice, the Resource Rent tax attempts to reduce distortion by&#13;
letting firms deduct costs more completely than the PDS and similar systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
An important element of such costs which is missed by these systems, is the&#13;
opportunity costs of funds during the period in which current profits are&#13;
negative. As the opportunity cost of funds is equal to their discount rate,&#13;
allowing losses to be cumulated at this rate of interest and be deducted from&#13;
current profits, makes all costs fully deductible 1/ Thus for a given&#13;
discount rate, an RRT with equal threshold rate would be nondistorting. In&#13;
terms of Figure 2, imposition of such a tax, either leaves both curves&#13;
unchanged if the project return is less than the threshold rate, or moves the&#13;
two curves down in proportion leaving peak capacity approximately unchanged.&#13;
Because of the way discounting is done in the present simulation model the&#13;
neutral cumulation rate is slightly higher than the discount rate. The RRT06&#13;
system is however found to be fairly undistorted.&#13;
With the cumulation rate at 15%, the RRT15 system represents a&#13;
situation in which the cumulation rate is clearly much higher than the&#13;
discount rate. Once the reserve size is known after the exploration phase,&#13;
any cost incurred will yield a guaranteed return of 15% (for fields with&#13;
returns greater than 15%) compared to the opportunity cost of 6% (in these&#13;
simulations). This provides an incentive to the firm to raise peak capacity&#13;
(lower FLATP). Thus this system has the effect of accelerating extraction of&#13;
oil and lowering To. In terms of the simplified representation of Figure&#13;
2(c), the system overcompensates the firm for costs incurred, so that the cost&#13;
1/ It is as if all investment was financed by borrowing at this rate and all&#13;
such interest payment was deductible as cost.&#13;

line moves down relatively more than the revenue line. Optimal peak capacity&#13;
therefore increases for reserve sizes with return greater than 15%. 1/&#13;
Though the simplified presentation of Figure 2 provides a useful&#13;
visual comparison, the intertemporal pattern underlying these systems should&#13;
not be completely forgotten. Figure 3 presents the intertemporal pattern of&#13;
the effective tax rate for different systems. 2/ This is given for the mean&#13;
field size (lOOmi) at the peak capacity level corresponding to a flat period&#13;
of 4 years (the neutral level for this case), at the nominal tax rates&#13;
corresponding to those given under TAX in Table 1 (page 22). It is clear from&#13;
this Figure, that as we move from ROY to PDS to RRT06 to RRT15 the&#13;
intertemporal pattern of taxes changes from a less to more steeply rising one&#13;
(i.e. shifts from earlier to later periods). This would lead us to expect&#13;
production to shift in the opposite direction, i.e., increase in earlier&#13;
periods and be reduced in later ones as we move from ROY to RRT15. This is&#13;
precisely what happens.&#13;
3.2 Variation in Field Size, Discovery Risk and Host Discount Rate&#13;
Figures 4 and 5 show the pattern of distortion in terms of&#13;
comparative project value and flat period (respectively) for different field&#13;
sizes. 3/ From Figure 4(a) and 4(b) it is seen that except for some&#13;
anomalies, the present value of the project (PROJPV) is almost the same for&#13;
1/ The smoothly varying functions are somewhat misleading for this case.&#13;
This is particularly true for projects with returns of around 15%.&#13;
2/ This is merely the proportion of host government revenues to net project&#13;
return during the period.&#13;
3/ The tax rate is fixed for each system at the critical value at which the&#13;
firms' expected pure profit is zero under the system.&#13;

PART and RRT06 for all field sizes. Similarly the PROJPV for Production Share&#13;
lies below these, and for Royalty even further below, over most of the&#13;
range. The PROJPV for CRAT15 is almost identical to PART for field sizes&#13;
below 20 mi barrels. It then falls below the PROJPV of all systems, and&#13;
retains this relative position for higher field size. The reason for this&#13;
pattern is that smaller fields have a rate of return less than 15% so that no&#13;
tax is levied. The distorting effect of taxes is felt only for fields with&#13;
internal rate of return greater than 15%.&#13;
The variation in Project Present value with reserve size is a&#13;
reflection of shifts in the optimal peak capacity. Figure 5 shows this&#13;
relationship with period of flat production (FLATP) which is the inverse of&#13;
the peak capacity. For all systems we see a declining trend in FLATP with&#13;
reserve. The simple diagram used earlier again provides an intuitive&#13;
understanding, as depicted in Figure 6. As reserves go up, not only do&#13;
revenues increase, but the unit cost of production declines at each level of&#13;
peak capacity. This results in an increase (decrease) in peak capacity&#13;
(FLATP). The resource rent tax with cumulation rate 15% follows this general&#13;
pattern except at the field sizes with rates of return marginally greater than&#13;
15%. As the tax becomes applicable only when the internal rate of return&#13;
given the extraction path, becomes 15%, the time at which this happens, can be&#13;
pushed into the future by slowing extraction. This effect is completely the&#13;
inverse of the direct effect of a shift to higher field size, with the net&#13;

effect tending to reduce (increase) the optimal peak capacity (FLATP).&#13;
Further changes in field sizes have the usual effect depicted in Figure 6. 1/&#13;
Discovery Probability&#13;
A discovery probability of 0.1 represents a very low probability of&#13;
finding oil, even though in countries where there has been no exploration this&#13;
may not be an extreme value. The right hand side of Table 1 (page 22) gives&#13;
the same results, when this probability is increased to .2. In the context of&#13;
the present model, this merely raises the expected rent element in the value&#13;
of the tract. As we would expect, if the expected zero profit condition is&#13;
unchanged, leasing must involve higher tax rates under every system. A&#13;
comparison of the columns headed 'TAX' in the two parts of Table 1 confirms&#13;
this expectation.&#13;
A comparison of the efficiency loss, under 'PVGRV', shows that the&#13;
efficiency of every system deteriorates with taxes. The effect of an increase&#13;
in tax can again be visualized in terms of the diagrams in Figure 2 or 6.&#13;
Higher taxes increase the peak capacity further for PDS and ROY and reduce it&#13;
further for the RRT15 system leaving the ordering of systems unchanged. The&#13;
gap between the efficiency losses under different systems also widens because&#13;
an equivalent increase in taxes changes the revenue curve by approximately&#13;
similar amounts, but the cost curve by different amounts (zero for ROY, more&#13;
1/ Because of the discreteness of the optimizing process and the difficulty&#13;
of modeling the change from a flat period of one to that of zero within&#13;
this process, the flat period remains at one subsequently. Therefore the&#13;
degree of distortion measured by one appears to be a lower limit for this&#13;
system for the case of zero home taxes.&#13;

for PDS most for RRTO6). 1/ The graph of host government discounted revenue&#13;
against discovery probability in Figure 7 shows these effects for&#13;
representative systems. 2/ Finally, it should be noted that the variation in&#13;
project present value (Figure 8) and of FLAT period (Figure 9) with reserve&#13;
size is essentially the same as in Figures 4 and 5 respectively, for the .10%&#13;
discovery probability case. 3/&#13;
Discount Rate Change&#13;
Historically one of the arguments in favor of a royalty system 4/&#13;
has been that the government starts receiving some revenues as soon as&#13;
production starts. Imperfections in international capital markets also&#13;
suggest that the international borrowing rate for many developing countries&#13;
may be higher than that for the oil majors who are the most likely lessors.&#13;
It is of interest to see what happens when the host government discount rate&#13;
is different from that of the firms.&#13;
On theoretical grounds, we would expect a host government discount&#13;
rate greater than the firms to improve the relative position of systems which&#13;
1/   The fact that the RRTO6 system suffers a slight efficiency loss suggests&#13;
that this system is not completely neutral. As noted in an earlier&#13;
footnote this is merely an artifact of the model used; because of the way&#13;
discounting is done the neutral cumulation rates is slightly greater than&#13;
6%.&#13;
2/   Because of a discontinuity in the simulation model between a flat period&#13;
of one to that of zero, the results for ACRAT15 become unreliable for tax&#13;
rates above 90% (needed for the DTRSK=0.8 case). The DTRSK = 0.85 case&#13;
confirms the general trend however.&#13;
3/   These Figures also depict the income tax system as being the same or more&#13;
efficient than the PDS at all reserves--FLATP closer to RRT06. The&#13;
RRT+IT case should be ignored for the time being.&#13;

result in acceleration of extraction and to worsen those which produce a&#13;
deceleration in extraction. The opposite effect would be observed for a&#13;
government discount rate less than those of the firms. The actual results&#13;
given in Table 2 largely bears this out. The most striking result in this&#13;
Table is the negative value for the RRT06 system for the high discount case.&#13;
1/   This means that the system is superior to the neutral participation&#13;
system (PART) for government discount rates higher than the firms, despite the&#13;
fact that To for RRT06 is greater than for PART. The reason is that&#13;
government sharing of development costs under PART results in negative&#13;
revenues in earlier periods, which cannot be compensated for by slightly&#13;
higher returns from greater efficiency in later periods.&#13;
Two changes in the efficiency ranking of systems are worth noting.&#13;
One is the dramatic improvement in the position of RRT15 in the high discount&#13;
rate case, to an efficiency loss less than that for IT,PDS and Royalty. One&#13;
might also note that the Royalty system should definitely not be used if the&#13;
government discount rate is higher. The results from analysis which assume a&#13;
fixed revenue size and a given fixed profile, and which only allow stopping&#13;
time to change can be seriously misleading. The other change is the&#13;
attainment of first position by the Income Tax system, equaling RRT06, in the&#13;
low discount case.&#13;
3.3 Sovereign Risk and the Progressivity Factor&#13;
The theoretical analysis of the problem of Sovereign risk or&#13;
Nationalization risk in natural resource leasing is given in the appendix.&#13;
1/   And the RRT09 system with CRAT = 9%.   This system will be discussed&#13;
further in subsequent sections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
The basic assumption of this analysis is that even if the government which is&#13;
leasing out the tract has no intention of changing contract terms, the firms'&#13;
perceptions of such a possibility can affect rent collection. A government&#13;
which is trying to decide on the appropriate tax contract system must&#13;
therefore take account of this fact. It is shown that the optimal contract is&#13;
such that the share of the government must increase towards one at high&#13;
project values (reserve size): despite other complicating factors, an&#13;
increase in the probability of nationalization for high reserves ensures that&#13;
the government share must eventually rise with reserve value.&#13;
CORR as Summary Measure&#13;
These results can be used for interpreting the output from the&#13;
simulation model. For this purpose a summary measure defining the&#13;
progressivity of the system is useful for comparison purposes. Traditionally,&#13;
the government's share (GOVPER) defined in terms of the percentage of the host&#13;
governments discounted present value (PVGVRV) to the total present value of&#13;
the project (PROJPV) for a given reserve size has been used. I/ The&#13;
correlation of this measure with the project present value for each reserve&#13;
size seems to be a natural candidate for measuring the progressivity of the&#13;
system. This intuition turned out to be grossly misleading because of the&#13;
very complex nonlinear relationships between GOVPER and PROJPV in systems such&#13;
as PDS, IT and ROY. The problem arises at low reserve sizes. Because of&#13;
incomplete compensation for exploration costs the government receives a&#13;
positive return on fields with zero or negative present value. The result is&#13;
1/   All these are calculated using the same discount rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
that as field size declines to these levels GOVPER tends towards infinity and&#13;
then becomes negative. Thus a correlation coefficient based on GOVPER is&#13;
heavily distorted by these numbers.&#13;
Two other ratios were defined; Ratio 1 and Ratio 2 which are the&#13;
inverse of each other:&#13;
Ratio 1 = PROJPV - PVGVRV&#13;
PVGVRV&#13;
Ratio 2  =        PVGVRV&#13;
PROJPV - PVGVRV&#13;
These are shown in Figures 10 to 14 for various systems.    Figures 10 and 11&#13;
demonstrate that ratio 1 is suitable for the RRT system, but ratio 2 tends to&#13;
infinity when the internal rate of return for the project goes below the&#13;
cumulation rate (i.e. PVGVRV goes to zero). Figure 12 to 14 show that in&#13;
contrast Ratio 2 is appropriate for systems such as PDS and Royalty, but that&#13;
Ratio 1 suffers from the same problem as GOVPER. We therefore defined the&#13;
progressivity factor CORR as follows:&#13;
(COV(RATIO1, PROJPV)/VAR(RATIO1)VAR(PROJPV) for pure RRT systems&#13;
CORR = (&#13;
(-COV(RATIO2,PROJPV)/VAR(RATI02)VAR(PROJPV) for PDS,IT, Royalty and&#13;
others&#13;
Though the two ways of calculating the correlation coefficient are not exactly&#13;
equivalent they give a reasonable degree of comparability.&#13;

Simulation Results&#13;
The columns headed CORR in Table 1 (page 22) gives the result of&#13;
these simulations. The most striking result from these calculations is that&#13;
except for the RRT15 and PRT systems all others are regressive. Secondly, the&#13;
RRT06 system seems to be less regressive than the participation system. This&#13;
is partly a consequence of the type of participation system used, in which the&#13;
entire exploration cost burden is borne by the firm. A system in which these&#13;
costs were also shared would result in a zero progressivity factor. 1/&#13;
Table 1 also shows an intriguing relationship between efficiency loss&#13;
and progressivity of the system. This is illustrated in Figure 15. Ignoring&#13;
RRT15 for the moment, there appears to be a positive relationship between the&#13;
efficiency and progressivity of different systems: that is, less efficient&#13;
systems are also less progressive. The significant progressivity of the RRT15&#13;
system also suggests the existence of a trade-off between efficiency and&#13;
progressivity for different variants of the Resource Rent Tax system. We will&#13;
investigate this issue in more detail in the section on.RRRTs.&#13;
At this point it is useful to return to Figures 10 and 12 to examine&#13;
the actual changes in proportions with project value which underlie the&#13;
correlation coefficient. Figure 12 shows that the ratio of firms returns to&#13;
that of the host government increases steadily with field size, for both&#13;
production share and royalty systems. The changes are more marked however for&#13;
low value fields. As already noted, for these fields the firm not only takes&#13;
the losses from exploration, but is also required to yield some of the&#13;
positive returns during production to the government. Figure 10 shows a&#13;
1/   Note that the coefficient of variation of after tax net present value of&#13;
the firm headed CATPV is negatively correlated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
similar pattern for the RRT06 system for low value fields. An important&#13;
difference is that the firm does not have to pay the government anything for&#13;
fields with a rate of return less than the cumulation rate (6%).&#13;
The relationship between efficiency and progressivity for these&#13;
systems, noted earlier (Figure 15) seems to arise from this effect on low&#13;
value fields. As a single tax rate has to be agreed on before the size of the&#13;
field is known, any such rate is relatively high (low) for low (high) reserve&#13;
fields; that is, the systems are "regressive." As previously discussed, high&#13;
tax rates result in higher distortions. Thus both the inefficiency and the&#13;
regressivity tend to be high at low field sizes. Systems with more distortion&#13;
therefore tend to be both more regressive and more inefficient.&#13;
The RRT15 system differs significantly from this pattern. Figure 10&#13;
shows the contrast with the RRT06 system. The RRT15 system displays clear&#13;
progressivity over the range of field sizes. More importantly the government&#13;
gets nothing (in RRT15) over the range of field sizes for which RRT06 is most&#13;
sharply regressive. The source of inefficiency in RRT15 is opposite to that&#13;
of the other systems, that is, the over compensation of costs incurred by the&#13;
firm. The major effect of these inefficiencies is felt at relatively higher&#13;
field sizes; as shown in Figure 5 (page 31), the production profile (FLATP) is&#13;
more changed from the neutral for large fields. For these field sizes, the&#13;
firm effectively obtains a fixed return (15%), plus a share (equal to 1-RRT&#13;
rate) of any excess over 15%. The excess depends on the tax rate. Thus the&#13;
firm's average return declines with field size over this range, resulting in a&#13;
progressive system. Higher distortion is therefore linked to a higher average&#13;
share for the host government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Discussions in developing countries often focus on the government&#13;
share in total project value under different systems (GOVPER). As shown in&#13;
Figure 16, this depends on the value of the field discovered, though most&#13;
earlier analysis, focussed on the mean field size. Our analysis of sovereign&#13;
risk also suggests that it is important to look at this percentage for higher&#13;
value (size) fields. The results are somewhat disappointing, in that even for&#13;
the most progressive system (RRT15) the proportion does not increase markedly&#13;
for reserves greater than the mean size of 100: GOVPER goes from&#13;
approximately 60% for the 100 mi field to about 72% for the 600 mi field. For&#13;
the RRT06 system it increases marginally over the same range. The&#13;
conventional solution to this problem, is a system of multiple rates which we&#13;
investigate subsequently. An alternative solution requires relating tax rates&#13;
to field size, which suffers from severe information problems in any practical&#13;
implementation. 1/&#13;
3.4 Home Income Tax and Deduction Versus Credit Systems&#13;
As alluded to in the introduction, most earlier analysis of tax-&#13;
contract systems has ignored the existence of home government taxes. The one&#13;
exception is Tyner's analysis of the Indian tax system which included&#13;
provision for a US type credit system. Most developed countries which are the&#13;
home bases of natural resource companies, however, have a deduction type of&#13;
system. We will therefore focus on this type of system in much of our&#13;
analysis. The comparative effects of a credit vs. deduction system were also&#13;
1/   Finally we might note that for a discovery probability of .2, Table 1&#13;
shows that RRT06 is more, and PDS, IT and ROY somewhat less, regressive&#13;
than for the .1 discovery probability case.&#13;

done for situations where one might expect different effects. These will be&#13;
presented in this section.&#13;
The zero expected profit condition for putting different systems on&#13;
an equivalent basis, must of course, be defined here net of home as well as&#13;
host government taxes. The home government income tax though not exactly the&#13;
same as a host government income tax is very similar. In the hypothetical&#13;
case in which there is only a home government income tax, and no host&#13;
government taxes, its effect would be similar to that given in Table 1 for the&#13;
host income tax. For this hypothetical case we therefore expect the&#13;
production profile to be shifted to later periods, lowering peak capacity and&#13;
raising the flat period on average (i.e. T0 would rise). 1/ In the presence&#13;
of the host government tax-contract systems, the final effect depends on the&#13;
interaction of the two. A home government tax rate of 45X was chosen as a&#13;
reasonable one for illustrative purposes.&#13;
Table 3 shows the results of the system comparisons in the presence&#13;
of the home government tax. Comparison with the zero home tax results in&#13;
Table 1 shows that the efficiency losses (PVGVRV column) for the Resource Rent&#13;
Tax (RRT06), Income Tax, Production Share, (Profit Share) and Royalty systems&#13;
have increased. There are two related reasons for this. Firstly, as all&#13;
these systems tend to slow extraction by lowering optimal peak capacity, the&#13;
distorting effect of the home tax and most systems act in the same direction&#13;
to increase distortion. This is confirmed by the fact that the mean flat&#13;
periods (T0 column) are higher for each of them. Secondly, though the tax&#13;
1/   The operation of the home system is such that the home government shares&#13;
in all current losses. Distortions only arise from the depreciable&#13;
expenses. The distorting effect is therefore close to that of the RRT06&#13;
system.&#13;

rate implicit in each system (TAX column) has to be reduced to satisfy the&#13;
zero expected profit condition, the total marginal tax rate is higher. This&#13;
tends to increase distortion in these systems, but has very little effect on&#13;
"the neutral system like PART."&#13;
The most surprising results, at least to me, were that the ordering&#13;
of these systems was completely unchanged. This is true for both discovery&#13;
probability 0.1 and .2. The increase in tax levels in going from the lower to&#13;
higher discovery probability has the results outlined earlier. Figures 17 (a)&#13;
and (b) suggest an essentially similar pattern of variation of project present&#13;
value with reserve size. There is an interesting difference worth noting.&#13;
Figure 17(a) shows that for small low value fields the project present value&#13;
for the production share and royalty systems is lower than for RRT06. The&#13;
reason is that approximately 1Z of the lowest size fields are no longer&#13;
developed in the first two systems. 1/ The existence of the home income tax&#13;
is largely responsible for the increase in nondeveloped fields.&#13;
The home income tax has two effects. Because of its loss-offset&#13;
provision, the net intangible exploration cost is reduced for the firms.&#13;
Secondly, the second stage choice of whether to go ahead and develop these&#13;
marginal fields is affected adversely; if the firm decides to develop the&#13;
field, returns from producing are lower than they would have been in the&#13;
absence of the home tax. If it decides not to produce it gets an extra&#13;
benefit in the form of a partial write-off of tangible exploration costs. The&#13;
incentive for not developing marginal fields is therefore increased.&#13;
1/   A small proportion of fields are not developed even when home country&#13;
taxes are zero. As the lowest cost field in the Monte Carlo simulation&#13;
is 3 mi. we do not know the cutoff field size between 0 and 3 mi. for&#13;
these cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
The difference in the impact on smaller fields under production share&#13;
(PDS) and royalty (ROY) is barely noticeable for discovery probability .1, but&#13;
becomes clearer at discovery probability .2. Figure 17(b) shows clearly that&#13;
project present value is significantly lower under Royalty than under PDS, for&#13;
smaller field sizes. Approximately 2% of all potential fields are unlikely to&#13;
be developed under ROY compared to a little over 1% for PDS. 1/ Non-&#13;
development of more fields does not, however, unambiguously lead to lower rent&#13;
collection by the host government. This is because much of the exploration&#13;
cost burden is borne by the home government so that the firm is better off for&#13;
these fields compared to the no home government tax case. This is also the&#13;
most likely reason for the narrowing of the efficiency difference between PDS&#13;
and ROY, by about 2 percentage points as shown in Tables 3 and 1. 2/&#13;
Figures 18(a) and 18(b) show the variation in the period of flat&#13;
production underlying the mean value differences in Table 3 (To) mentioned&#13;
earlier. The RRT06 system flat periods are now higher (and peak capacity&#13;
lower) than the neutral PART values for almost all reserve sizes. The values&#13;
of the flat periods for RRT06, PDS and Royalty follow a basically similar&#13;
pattern however. The flat periods for the last two systems tax are however&#13;
noticeably closer for low value fields for the reasons discussed earlier.&#13;
1/   And still less than .5% for RRTO6.   For the zero home tax case the&#13;
corresponding number is less than .5% for all three of them.&#13;

RRT15 System&#13;
The most noteworthy effect of introducing the home tax system is the&#13;
change in the efficiency of the resource rent tax with a cumulation rate of&#13;
15% (RRTl5). As shown in Table 3 in the column headed PVCVRV, this system has&#13;
moved from last place to first place; though it ties with RRT06 at a discovery&#13;
probability of .1, it is unambiguously the best at more favourable risk&#13;
levels, as shown in the .2 case.&#13;
This remarkable change in the relative efficiency of the RRT15&#13;
system, is due to the fact that the distorting force of the home income tax&#13;
and that of the RRT15 system act in opposite directions; the home income tax&#13;
tends to lower peak capacity and decelerate production, while the resource&#13;
rent tax (RRT15) tends to raise peak capacity and accelerate production. The&#13;
net effect is a peak capacity much closer to the neutral. 1/ It is therefore&#13;
surprising to find that the mean flat period To is greater for RRT15 than for&#13;
RRT06 which itself is greater than for PART.&#13;
The explanation for this paradox is found in Figures 18(a) and (b)&#13;
which give the optimal flat period for different reserves. Both Figures show&#13;
that the flat period, and consequently its inverse, the peak capacity, for&#13;
RRT15 is closer to PART than is the flat period for RRT06, for most reserve&#13;
sizes. The exception is the field sizes straddling the one whose rate of&#13;
return is 15%. As in the no home country tax case, the switch from no RRT to&#13;
an RRT at this point results in a sharp fall (rise) in optimal peak capacity&#13;
(flat period). As To is a simple average over the flat periods, these cases&#13;
have a large effect in pushing up the average flat period. The expected&#13;
1/   The PRT's relative position also improves for similar reasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
efficiency loss is implicitly weighted more heavily by the larger more&#13;
profitable fields in which efficiency loss is relatively low, so the average&#13;
loss remains low for RRT15.&#13;
Figure 19 gives the intertemporal pattern of effective tax rates for&#13;
the mean field size at the no tax peak capacity level. The differences&#13;
between the systems are essentially the same as those given in Figure 3 for&#13;
the zero home tax case. The tax patterns shifts relatively from earlier to&#13;
later years as we go from Royalty to Production share to RRT06 to RRT15. The&#13;
only noticeable difference is that the tax pattern seems to be compressed&#13;
together. The reason is that as the same standard home tax of 45% applies in&#13;
all cases, the particularities of each system which produce different patterns&#13;
have less weight. We therefore expect efficiency differences in the first&#13;
three systems to be reduced. This is, however, offset by the differential&#13;
impact on marginal fields. The progressivity of the systems can be analyzed&#13;
in terms of Figures 20 to 22. Figure 20 shows a positive relationship between&#13;
field size and ratio 2 for both PDS and Royalty indicating regressive&#13;
systems. As the RRT06 curve is negatively sloped except for the initial&#13;
switch from zero to positive RRT this also suggests a regressive system.&#13;
Figure 22 provides a comparative look at all the systems, with the government&#13;
proportion rising over all fields for RRT15. All three diagrams show&#13;
basically the same pattern as the one found with no home taxes.&#13;
Figures 23 (a) and (b) show the efficiency-progressivity diagram for&#13;
the systems, with home taxes positive. Efficiency and progressivity now&#13;
change in the same direction in going from one system to another including the&#13;
RRT15. This contrasts with the zero home tax case where there was a trade-off&#13;
between efficiency and progressivity in choosing between RRT06 and RRT15:&#13;

this result is primarily due to the increased efficiency of the RRT15 system&#13;
as analyzed earlier. The resource rent tax with cumulation rate of 15X&#13;
appears therefore to be the overwhwelmingly superior system in the presence of&#13;
home taxes. 1/&#13;
The discussion of this section so far relates explicitly to the&#13;
deduction type home government tax system. The results are implicitly&#13;
applicable to the credit system, because credit, at least in the most&#13;
prominent US type tax, does not apply to contractual payments such as royalty,&#13;
production share or resource rent tax. There must be an acceptable and&#13;
effective income tax system in the country before the USA Internal Revenue&#13;
Service will allow treatment of host government income tax as credit. 2/ A&#13;
meaningful comparison of system performance in the credit vs. deduction system&#13;
can only be done by introducing a host government tax into the picture. Two&#13;
cases are analyzed. One in which the host income tax is less than the home&#13;
income tax so that incomplete use is made of credit provision, and one in&#13;
which it is equal.&#13;
Deduction vs. Credit System in Presence of Host Income Tax&#13;
As far as the deduction method is concerned, there are now basically&#13;
three stages of tax payments; the payments under the contract system, the host&#13;
government income tax levied on the firm's share, and the home government&#13;
income tax levied after both these sets of payments have been made. Previous&#13;
1/   More on this in the section on RRT.&#13;
2/   As long as such a system exists, the US IRS accepts an implicit&#13;
calculation of income tax for credit; for example, in the case of India&#13;
as analyzed by Tyner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
analysis suggests that the two sets of income taxes would reinforce themselves&#13;
in providing an incentive to reduce (raise) peak capacity (flat period), and&#13;
shift production to later periods. For the cases considered here there are&#13;
essentially two levels of payment in the credit case; the contractual share&#13;
and the home government income tax. 1/&#13;
Table 4 gives the efficiency losses for the different systems, at&#13;
different levels of discovery risk, and the two levels of host income tax (30%&#13;
and 45%) for the Deduction and Credit cases. Somewhat surprisingly, the&#13;
ordering of the systems--RRT15, RRT06, PDS, ROY--is the same in both cases.&#13;
The only difference is that the superiority of RRT15 is somewhat clearer in&#13;
the credit case. The reason is the just noted addition of another level of&#13;
taxation in the deduction case. To maintain the firms at zero expected rents,&#13;
the resource rent tax has to be correspondingLy lower. 2/ So the effect of&#13;
this component in pushing peak capacity up to more neutral levels is smaller&#13;
than when only the home income tax is applicable. As the effect of the credit&#13;
system is very similar to the latter case, RRT15 is more clearly superior&#13;
under credit than under the deduction system.&#13;
The efficiency differences between the RRT06 and production share,&#13;
and between the latter and the royalty system seem to be heightened in the&#13;
credit case. This seems to be unambiguously true in the partial credit case&#13;
of host income tax equal to 30%. Some anomalies do arise in the full credit&#13;
case of 45%. 3/ These results can be seen by taking the difference in&#13;
1/   In effect the home government collects the income tax for earnings in the&#13;
host country, and gives part or whole of it to the host government. More&#13;
precisely, TAX = MAX (TAXPHI, TAXPHIH).&#13;
2/   The resource tax for RRT15 and DTRSK = 1, home tax 45% is 64%, 42% and&#13;
22% for host income tax rates of zero, 30% and 45% respectively.&#13;

efficiency losses, or' from Figures 24 and 25, where these systems are much&#13;
closer together along the X axis, for the deduction case. Broadly speaking&#13;
the income taxes have such a large role in the deduction case, so that given&#13;
their similar effects on optimal peak capacity, the different effects arising&#13;
from the particularities of each system play a much smaller role.&#13;
The progressivity-efficiency diagrams of Figures 24 (a,b) and 25&#13;
(a,b) also show that in both the credit and deduction system efficiency and&#13;
progressivity are positively related. A minor difference is that in the&#13;
deduction system there is little efficiency gain associated with the more&#13;
progressive RRT15 as compared to RRT06. 1/ This is what we found earlier for&#13;
the deduction system with zero host income tax. Another minor difference is&#13;
that the royalty system is less regressive in the credit case for higher&#13;
discovery risk.&#13;
3.5 Sensitivity of Results to Changes in Parameters&#13;
The two base systems, the one with no home income tax, and the one&#13;
with a home income tax of 45%, 2/ were subjected to a range of parameter&#13;
changes. Each parameter was changed by about 1/3 often in both directions,&#13;
and the systems compared under each such change. Among the geological&#13;
parameters changed were the mean and standard deviation of the reserve&#13;
distribution, uncertainty in investment costs and the proportion of reserves&#13;
1/   Figure 23(a)(b).&#13;
2/   Deduction system; though as noted earlier the credit system should give&#13;
virtually identical results when there is no host income tax.&#13;

after which production decline starts. 1/ Among the economic parameters&#13;
changed, were the rate of growth of oil prices, inflation, depreciation&#13;
provisions, and the discount rate of the firm. The geo-economic parameters&#13;
changed were development and exploration costs, the time pattern of&#13;
development outlays and the pattern of production build up.&#13;
Leaving aside the question of firm discount rates for the end, it is&#13;
remarkable how stable the ranking of different systems is under such a wide&#13;
variety of conditions. An extreme example of this is the introduction of&#13;
investment cost uncertainty, 2/ which leaves even the actual efficiency losses&#13;
virtually unchanged. This is shown in Table 5 for the zero host income tax&#13;
case. Because of the remarkable stability of the ordering, we focus largely&#13;
on the question of weather the results seem to match the changes we might&#13;
expect analytically.&#13;
Table 6 shows the effects of changes in the mean of the reserve&#13;
distribution. We expect an increase in the mean size of the field to increase&#13;
profitability of all systems. As cost per unit revenue fall, we might also&#13;
expect that the distortion caused by incomplete deduction of costs in the&#13;
production share and royalty system to diminish. There is a contrasting&#13;
factor, however, in that tax rates must rise to keep firms expected rents&#13;
unchanged. The net result (Table 6) for the no host income tax case is that&#13;
the efficiency of both PDS and Royalty systems tends to decline with the mean&#13;
field size.&#13;

There is one change in ordering, though it occurs in the limited case&#13;
of low probability of oil discovery and low mean reserve. In this case the&#13;
RRT15 system becomes better than the royalty. Our earlier discussion of the&#13;
pattern of distortion over field sizes, 1/ showed that the major distortions&#13;
occur at high, more profitable field sizes, with no distortion for fields with&#13;
returns less than 15%. These distortions are much more prominent at high RRT&#13;
rates. When the mean field size is very low, and low return fields have a&#13;
much larger weight, the RRT15 becomes much more inefficient.&#13;
Tables 7 and 8 show respectively the efficiency losses for different&#13;
standard deviations in the reserve distribution (RSTD) and the proportion of&#13;
reserves which can be extracted without triggering the exponential decline&#13;
rate (Delta). The ordering of losses is virtually unchanged for both types of&#13;
variations. 2/ The only noteworthy change in efficiency differences is for&#13;
royalty which seems to suffer a relative deterioration for both low and high&#13;
values of standard deviation. As this is so clearly the worst system even for&#13;
the base case (at PHI=.45) this issue was not pursued further.&#13;
The effect of price and cost changes is most clearly seen by&#13;
analyzing the base case with zero home income tax. An increase in cost (or a&#13;
reduction in price) would tend to reduce the effect of cost changes in&#13;
profits. We would therefore expect that both systems which tend to under&#13;
compensate for costs (PDS,ROY) as well as those which over compensate (RRT15)&#13;
would tend to deteriorate with increase in development costs. In the presence&#13;
of a home income tax even RRT06 (and possibly RRT15) system would tend to&#13;
1/   Figures 4 (a) (b) and 5 (a) (b) for PHI=O.&#13;
2/   The shift of RRT15 to second place for DTRSK-.85, Delta=.55 appears to be&#13;
an anomaly which does not fit into the pattern.&#13;

display a similar pattern because of the under compensation of costs due to&#13;
this.&#13;
Table 9 confirms this pattern for the production share system and&#13;
RRT15 system in general, and for RRT06 at PHI=.45. For the PHI=.45 case the&#13;
RRT15 deteriorates less than other systems, as we would expect, 1/ so that it&#13;
becomes more clearly the best system as costs rise. Curiously though, royalty&#13;
does not display the expected pattern, first deteriorating then improving with&#13;
costs. The last may be partly due a restriction in the simulation model which&#13;
artificially keeps the total production period from going over 50 years.&#13;
Table 10 which gives the effect of changing the pattern of expenditures&#13;
towards the present has essentially the same effect as an increase in the&#13;
cost. 2/&#13;
Exploration costs have somewhat different effects. When production&#13;
decisions are made, these costs are sunk costs, and do not affect them. The&#13;
main effect of reducing these costs is therefore to increase tax rates needed&#13;
to maintain equal expected rents. We, therefore, expect the efficiency losses&#13;
to increase for all systems when these costs are lowered. This is confirmed&#13;
by the results in Table 1 (a) (b). The only exception is RRT15 which tends to&#13;
improve somewhat. The ordering is unchanged however.&#13;
According to conventional analysis, an increase in price growth&#13;
relative to the discount rate should shift production towards the present. In&#13;
the present context this should have the additional effect of tending to push&#13;
1/   Because the pushing in effect of RRT15 counters the pushing out effect of&#13;
the home income tax.&#13;
2/   The accelerated pattern corresponds to an increase in cost over size, and&#13;
shows the same anomaly for the royalty system.&#13;

PDS and ROY towards more efficient levels and to push RRT15 further away from&#13;
the efficient. The last effect may be somewhat dampened in the presence of&#13;
home taxes. The absolute rise in price levels would tend to have an effect&#13;
similar to a fall in costs and reinforce the above effects in PDS and ROY but&#13;
dampen it for RRT15.&#13;
Table 12 confirms the analysis most clearly for the production share&#13;
system. RRT15 is also essentially consistent with the basic analysis if the&#13;
slight improvement for the PHI=O, DTRSK = .9 base case is laid to the absolute&#13;
price effect. For PHI = .45, this factor apparently overwhelms the RRT15&#13;
effects. The royalty system has the same anomaly as in the cost variations&#13;
(this time at small price changes) and probably for the same reason.&#13;
In the present model inflation effects prices, costs, nominal&#13;
discount rates and cumulation rates for RRT, which are fixed in terms of real&#13;
rates. It is hard to predict the precise effects of inflation except for the&#13;
usual feeling that inflation tends to increase existing distortions. Table 13&#13;
seems to confirm this general impression except for CRAT15 with no other&#13;
taxes. In fact it improves to the point of overtaking royalty at discovery&#13;
risk .85. A similar and quicker reversal in position also occurs when the&#13;
production buildup can be accelerated without cost (Table 14).&#13;
Changes in the rate of depreciation affect both home and host income&#13;
taxes. When the former is positive, a slowing of depreciation transfers&#13;
profits from the firm to home government in earlier periods. This results in&#13;
a worsening of all systems as shown in Table 15.&#13;
Finally we come to the important question of the effect of discount&#13;
rate changes. As far as the resource rent tax is concerned it is inextricably&#13;
linked to the question of different cumulation rates, and we will discuss it&#13;

in great detail in the next chapter. As the royalty, production share and&#13;
similar systems tend to stretch out production to later periods, we would&#13;
expect an increase in their efficiency loss with increases in the discount&#13;
rate. This is essentially what we find as shown in Table 16. 1/ The working&#13;
of RRT systems is critically dependent on the gap between the cumulation rate&#13;
and the firm's discount rate, and this is the subject to which we now turn.&#13;
4. The Resource Rent Tax and Related Systems&#13;
As Table 16 shows, for the no home income tax case (Phi=O), the RRT15&#13;
systems improves drastically with an increase in the discount rate. The same&#13;
sort of rapid improvement is seen in the RRT06 system at lower discovery&#13;
probabilities (.15). These results are suggestive but require a more detailed&#13;
analysis of the effect of the cumulation rate for a given discount rate.&#13;
4.1 Single levels of RRT&#13;
We start by analyzing fully the case in which home government taxes&#13;
are zero. Table 18 gives the efficiency losses of the single level resource&#13;
rent tax system with different levels of cumulation rates. It is useful to&#13;
think of these as different systems or more accurately as different types of&#13;
RRT systems. If we look at any of the columns labeled PVCVRV, we find that&#13;
the efficiency of the system declines with the cumulation rate. As the&#13;
interest/discount rate used by the firm is six percent it is more accurate to&#13;
1/   Royalty again tends to improve beyond a point as has been noticed in&#13;
several earlier cases.&#13;

describe this as a fall in efficiency with an increase in the difference&#13;
between the discount rate and the cumulation rate. 1/&#13;
A more important variation worth noting is the deterioration in the&#13;
efficiency of each system as tax rates increase with a rise in discovery&#13;
probability. Thus RRT15 is much worse than the others at probability .1,&#13;
while RRT12 suffers a sharp relative deterioration at probability .15 and&#13;
RRTO9 at probability .2.&#13;
From the earlier analysis of RRT15, we know that once the field size&#13;
is known the firm gets a pure profit equal to the difference between the the&#13;
cumulation rate and the discount rate, on any costs incurred. This has the&#13;
effect of postponing the imposition of the resource rent tax or of reducing&#13;
its bite on total profits. Clearly the higher the tax rate the greater is the&#13;
incentive to introduce this distortion. Because of the discreteness of the&#13;
Monte Carlo process and the optimization procedures in the model the results&#13;
appear more sharply. The basic pattern of changes is, however, suggested by&#13;
the analysis and shown in Figure 26: that is a widening of the efficiency gap&#13;
between systems as rates rise and as cumulation rates diverge from the&#13;
discount rate.&#13;
The variation of the flat period (inverse of peak capacity) with&#13;
reserve size shows the underlying picture for a given tax rate. Thus Figure&#13;
27 shows that at tax rates corresponding to discovery probability .1 case. As&#13;
field size increases first RRT15 and then RRT12 reach their optimal at a flat&#13;
period of one year. RRTO9 remains more like RRT06 though flat period is lower&#13;
at many field sizes. At high discovery probability/higher tax rates we would&#13;
observe RRTO9 reaching a pattern similar to RRT12.&#13;
1/   Cumulation rates less than the discount rates are of less interest as far&#13;
as the RRT is concerned.&#13;

We return briefly to the sensitivity analysis of discount rates. As&#13;
a rise in the discount rate reduces the gap between it and the cumulation&#13;
rate, its effect should therefore be similar to that of a reduction in the&#13;
cumulation rate. This is what Table 16 shows; note particularly that CRAT15&#13;
under discovery probability .1.&#13;
Efficiency, Progressivity Trade-off&#13;
The positive relationship between progressivity and cumulation rates&#13;
is clearly apparent from the column headed Corr (Table 18, page 74). The&#13;
trade-off between efficiency and progressivity that this produces is&#13;
highlighted by Figure 28. Contrary to what was suggested by the earlier&#13;
analysis limited to cumulation rates of 6% and 15%, the trade-off is not&#13;
linear. Rapid gains in progressivity are made without significant loss of&#13;
efficiency as we start from a neutral cumulation rate (between 6 and 7%).&#13;
Somewhere below 9% the progressivity gains slow down sharply while efficiency&#13;
losses accelerate. This rate can be referred to as the "Turning Point"&#13;
cumulation rate. The general pattern is virtually the same at the higher&#13;
discovery probability of 0.2 (not shown).&#13;
The variation in the percentage of total project present value going&#13;
to the host government (GOVPER) which underlies the correlation coefficient is&#13;
shown in Figure 29 (and Figure 30). Firstly except for cumulation rate 6% all other&#13;
(single) RRTs show an unambiguous progressivity at low field sizes. 1/ Only&#13;
RRT15 appears, however, to show visible progressivity at the high field sizes&#13;
most relevant to the problem of sovereign risk reduction. Table 18 shows,&#13;
1/   The proportion of marginal fields not taxed of increases unambiguously&#13;
with the cumulation rate.&#13;

however, that RRT12 attains the same level of progressivity (0.74) at&#13;
discovery probability .15 and the CRAT= .04 10 mi under .15 shows this effect&#13;
most clearly.&#13;
We would therefore,expect RRT12 to show visible progressivity at&#13;
those tax rates. Similarly, though the progressivity of the RRT09 system has&#13;
risen, going from 0.9 to 0.5, it is only at higher discovery probability that&#13;
it attains similar progressivity levels.&#13;
We turn next to an analysis of the effect of cumulation rates in the&#13;
case in which there is a home government income tax of 45%. Our earlier&#13;
analysis showed that the existence of this tax makes the RRT15 much more&#13;
efficient by countering its tendency to push up peak capacity. This suggests&#13;
that the most efficient RRT system might be the one in which the two effects&#13;
cancel each other leaving an approximately neutral system. The left of&#13;
Table 19 shows that RRT09 has a mean flat period To=5.5 which is close to the&#13;
neutral 4.8. The 9% cumulation rate appears to be close to the most efficient&#13;
cumulation rate even though RRT12 has lower To. Because of the sharp rise in&#13;
flat period at fields with rates of return close to the cumulation rate of&#13;
each system, To tends to give an upwardly biased picture of the total&#13;
efficiency loss. 1/&#13;
We conclude therefore that the presence of a home income tax results&#13;
in an upward shift in the "turning point" cumulation rate (relative to the&#13;
interest rate). That is in the CRAT which yields the most efficient RRT&#13;
system. This upward adjustment is likely to be larger the greater the home&#13;
income tax. Another fact worth noting in Table 19 is that the most efficient&#13;
1/   This was also noted in an earlier discussion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

cumulation rate 1/ seems to increase as the discovery probability increases&#13;
and RRT rates increase. It also happens, however, that beyond a certain tax&#13;
rate the situation changes rapidly, and the same system deteriorates&#13;
rapidly. This is why higher cumulation rates are dropped as we move to high&#13;
discovery probability - discontinuities in the model make the numerical value&#13;
somewhat unreliable beyond these critical tax rates.&#13;
The earlier analysis of RRT15 suggested that as RRT15 was as&#13;
efficient as RRT06, but more progressive, there was no trade-off between&#13;
efficiency and equity in the presence of home government taxes. This was a&#13;
contrast to the case with no home income tax. The more complete analysis of&#13;
Table 19, depicted graphically in Figure 31 shows that this was misleading.&#13;
Though there is no trade-off at cumulation rates below 15% such a trade-off is&#13;
apparent for cumulation rates above 15%.&#13;
Comparison with the 45% home income tax case in Figure 28 shows that&#13;
the trade-off pattern is remarkably similar. The main difference is in the&#13;
cumulation rate at which the pattern shifts from being almost vertical to&#13;
virtually flat. This rate is approximately 9% with home tax equal to zero and&#13;
approximately 15% with home income tax equal to 45%. Thus the "turning point"&#13;
cumulation rate rises with the income tax rate. Another interesting fact&#13;
worth noting is that the "turning point system" is both more progressive and&#13;
less efficient at positive home income tax levels.&#13;
1/   From the host governments perspective, but not necessarily some abstract&#13;
perspective which gives positive weight to home government income.&#13;

Host Income Tax&#13;
High cumulation rate systems such as the RRT15 are much more&#13;
efficient in the presence of an income tax than without it. The question&#13;
arises, whether in the absence of a home income tax, the introduction of a&#13;
host government income tax will improve such systems. Table 20 shows that the&#13;
introduction of an income tax of 30% reduces the efficiency loss from 10% to&#13;
0.4%. As a 45% income tax worsens efficiency further, the best income tax for&#13;
this case is approximately 15%. The question therefore is whether a combined&#13;
RRT15-IT system is preferable to a turning point system such as RRT06.&#13;
Unfortunately the combined RRT15-IT system has a very low progressivity factor&#13;
because of the effect of the income tax on small low value fields and on the&#13;
marginal fields (flat period rises sharply for both). Though, such a system&#13;
is not generally preferred under a deduction system of home income taxes, the&#13;
efficiency losses can be minimized if it is preferred on other grounds. For&#13;
firms subject to the credit system of home government income taxation the&#13;
situation is quite different. In this case the presence of a host income tax&#13;
has such a powerful effect in transferring taxes from the home to the host&#13;
government, that it overwhelms minor losses in progressivity. In the presence&#13;
of a credit system the government must try to use an income tax which yields a&#13;
(deductible) tax liability equal to that which the firm would face in the home&#13;
country. Its total tax liability is then unaffected by the home income tax.&#13;
4.2 Multiple Level Resource Rent Tax Systems&#13;
So far we have considered RRT systems with a single threshold&#13;
level. One of the major objectives of the RRT system is to introduce greater&#13;
progressivity by using multiple threshold levels. In this section we analyse&#13;

two level RRT systems. Even with two levels a large number of choices open&#13;
up. As we have investigated the RRT06 and RRT15 systems extensively, it is&#13;
useful to combine these two. We therefore consider a double RRT system with&#13;
threshold rates of 6% and 15%. This is however not enough to define a system.&#13;
When there is a single threshold rate a system is easily defined with&#13;
respect to it i.e. by varying it. With two rates there are an incredible&#13;
number of possibilities. The two simplest ones are to hold the first rate&#13;
constant and use variations in the second to define the system, or fix the&#13;
second and vary the first. Other possibilities include choosing a fixed ratio&#13;
for the two tax rates and then varying both.&#13;
Table 21 presents the case with no home taxes. Three different&#13;
variants are presented, with the first level tax rate (RRTRI) fixed at 20%,&#13;
30% and 40% respectively. In each case the column headed TAX gives the&#13;
critical value of the second level tax (RRTR2). The first level tax comes&#13;
into effect when the internal rate of return exceeds 6% (CRATI=6%) and the&#13;
second level when it exceeds 15% (CRAT2=15%). The column headed PVGRV, which&#13;
gives the efficiency loss, shows that efficiency improves with an increase in&#13;
the tax rate applied at the 6% threshold. Higher first level taxes result in&#13;
an offsetting reduction in second level taxes. The net result is a lower&#13;
marginal rate on high value fields which carry a much greater weight in the&#13;
average efficiency loss. Comparing with earlier results, we see that these&#13;
losses are intermediate between those for RRT06 and RRTl5, and approach the&#13;
former as the first rate increases. The mean field size displays a similar&#13;

pattern, so it is a Little surprising to find that the marginal tax rate in&#13;
all these cases is very close to the corresponding rate for RRT15 1/.&#13;
The progressivity factor (under CORREL) comes as something of a&#13;
surprise. Contrary to conventional thinking a multiple RRT system does not&#13;
produce a more progressive system. In fact the progressivity factor is&#13;
intermediate between that for the RRT06 and RRT15 systems, and seems to&#13;
increase marginally as the 6% threshold tax rate rises.     The reason is that&#13;
only a very small proportion of fields have only the first tax rate applying&#13;
to them.  The larger fields which have both rates applying, not only have the&#13;
greatest rent element but are also the most susceptible to the distortion by&#13;
the 15% threshold rate. As already mentioned the marginal rate is slightly&#13;
higher than that for the RRT15 system, resulting in greater efficiency losses&#13;
at high field sizes.&#13;
Figure 32 puts these double RRT systems in perspective. The systems&#13;
with RRTR1=.2 and RRTR1=.3 are clearly inferior to the single rate systems.&#13;
The system with RRTR1=.4 lies on the trend line between the single rate&#13;
systems. This suggests that its results can be duplicated by a single rate&#13;
system with a cumulation rate of about 13%.&#13;
Table 22 and Figure 33 give the corresponding results for the case&#13;
with home income tax equal to 45%. Almost the same pattern of results is&#13;
obtained for efficiency loss variation with an increase in first level tax.&#13;

however. The reasons for this efficiency gain is clear from Figure 34. The&#13;

double RRT level dampens the sharp upward distortion in the flat period. As&#13;
one level of Resource Rent tax is already being paid the marginal tax from the&#13;
next level is smaller. As is clear from Figure 33 significant improvements in&#13;
Figures 32 and 33 progressivity can be attained using two RRT levels in the&#13;
presence of home government income taxes. Figure 35 shows the underlying&#13;
variation in host government share with reserves. In this case the&#13;
progressivity of the single level RRT15 system is noticably greater at large&#13;
field sizes. The double RRT system makes up for this at lower field sizes,&#13;
but countries with sovereign risk problems may prefer to use the single level&#13;
system.&#13;
As the RRT06 system is a regresssive one, we might hypothesize that&#13;
the use of a slightly higher first threshold might increase the progressivity&#13;
of the system sharply. Tables 23 and 24 give the results for a two level&#13;
system with threshold rates of 9% and 15%. For the case with a home income&#13;
tax the results in Table 24 reinforce the conclusions of the previous&#13;
analysis, that improvements in progressivity and marginal improvements in&#13;
efficiency are possible by using multi-level systems. For the no home income&#13;
tax case the results in Table 23 are also basically consistent with earlier&#13;
ones. Two systems, those with RRTR1=.20 and RRTR1=.30 seem to be inferior,&#13;
while the other two seem to fall on the trade-off line for single systems.&#13;
They should therefore be replicable by single level systems.&#13;
4.3 Annuity Capital Recovery and British Petroleum Revenue Tax&#13;
The two other systems, which are similar to the RRT in that they ---&#13;
increase optimal peak capacity and accelerate production, are the Annuity&#13;
Capital Recovery and British Petroleum Revenue Tax. Annuity Capital recovery&#13;
combines the interest cost deduction feature of the RRT with some restrictions&#13;

in Appendix 2. The main reason for the pushing-in effect (accelerated&#13;
production) in the present case, is a provision for deducting the value of up&#13;
to 7.3 mi barrels of oil in the first few years of production. This provides&#13;
a strong incentive to raise peak capacity and get the full benefit of this&#13;
deduction before time runs out. This is shown for the no home country tax&#13;
case in Table 26. The first line gives the results without any deduction and&#13;
the second line with the standard deduction. Note the differences in To and&#13;
in PVGVRV. The PRT system becomes much more efficient without this&#13;
deduction. Even without the deduction, however, the PRT results in&#13;
accelerated production (on average), contrary to Dasgupta and Heals'&#13;
hypothesis of deceleration.&#13;
The PRT system as used in Britain is so hemmed in by restrictions&#13;
that changes in the profit share rate have no effect on host government&#13;
revenues. That is, tax rises do not result in reinstatement of the zero&#13;
profit condition at higher discovery probabilities. The flexibility is&#13;
slightly greater at a positive home income tax rate as shown in Table 27.&#13;
Efficiency of the system again improves when the oil value deduction is&#13;
removed.&#13;

5. Production Share and Related Systems&#13;
Two aspects of the Production Share system were worth analysis.&#13;
First were the restrictions on the proportion of cost (CSTFAC) and the time&#13;
period (NYCT) over which costs carried over from the exploration and&#13;
development phases could be deducted. Tables 28 and 29 show that the greater&#13;
the speed with which costs could be deducted (lower NYCT, higher CSTFAC) the&#13;
more efficient the system. This was true for both zero and positive home&#13;
income tax system. Some anomalies in the results were due to two factors.&#13;
The discreteness of our Monte-Carlo optimization procedures and the&#13;
interpolation procedure used to find the exact tax rate at which the firms&#13;
expected zero profit condition is satisfied.&#13;
The other important results relate to multiple level production share&#13;
systems as found in practice. Again there are hundreds of ways of defining&#13;
the system. Table 30 gives the results for two cases defined by the threshold&#13;
level of product at which a higher rate would apply. The threshold levels are&#13;
20,000 and 30,000 barrels. In both these cases the first level of the tax&#13;
below this threshold was fixed at 15% and the second rate was varied.&#13;
Efficiency of the Production Share system is seen to worsen dramatically.&#13;
Table 31 gives another set of experiments with different firm profit&#13;
share rates for the first level (PI1) and different threshold production&#13;
levels (PIL2). These results confirm that the system worsens with higher&#13;
threshold levels and higher first level rates. The reason for the dramatic&#13;
deterioration of the system is that the firm tries to avoid reaching the&#13;
threshold level by pushing down peak capacity even further. This moves it&#13;
even further for the optimum.&#13;

Variability in the tax rates for royalty or profit share have similar&#13;
effects. Table 32 shows this for the variable profit share case. Higher&#13;
variability (PFTFAC higher) results in a worsening of efficiency. We also&#13;
found that variability in rates does not have a very positive effect on the&#13;
progressivity factor. This is shown in Figure 36. Variable or graded royalty&#13;
rates produce even worse distortions than the production share systems with&#13;
multiple levels.&#13;
6. Conclusions&#13;
The significant conclusions of the study can be summarized as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(1) The historically popular Royalty or Severance Tax, was confirmed as&#13;
the most inefficient system for extracting rents from a natural&#13;
resource. Such a system has sometimes been justified on the grounds&#13;
that developing country governments may have a higher discount rate&#13;
than that of the firm's (They want the revenue flows to start&#13;
quickly). It was found that under these circumstances the Royalty&#13;
system deteriorates even further relative to others.&#13;
(2) A simple income tax, commonly used for other production activities&#13;
as well as in some mineral producing countries, though not the best&#13;
system, is a reasonably efficient system. For this purpose the tax&#13;
rate has of course to be set at the value appropriate to the&#13;
geologic prospects and economic conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
(3) A Production Share System of the India-Indonesia type simplified to&#13;
have only one sharing level, instead of the multiple levels commonly&#13;
found in these systems, performed marginally worse than the simple&#13;
income tax. With multiple levels, however, the efficiency of this&#13;
systems drops drastically, becoming worse than with a single Royalty&#13;
level (but not a variable royalty rate system).&#13;
(4) A carefully specified Resource Rent Tax System was found to be the&#13;
most efficient system. Care had to be exercised in not setting the&#13;
highest applicable cumulation rate too high relative to the discount&#13;
rate. The highest (reasonably) efficient cumulation rate also&#13;
depended on the host government income tax, and was positively&#13;
related to it. For example, with no income taxes, a cumulation rate&#13;
of 10% relative to a discount rate of 6%, the resource rent tax&#13;
system becomes the most inefficient system. With a host government&#13;
income tax rate of 15-30% it is, however, almost as efficient.&#13;
(5) Interestingly, the Resource Rent Tax System was also the most&#13;
progressive system. In fact the other systems mentioned above were&#13;
all regressive, in that the correlation between the host&#13;
government's share and the project's present value was negative.&#13;
(6) Multiple levels of Resource Rent Taxation which have been explicitly&#13;
designed to, increase the progressivity of this system do not have&#13;
any such effect in the absence of an income tax. An appropriately&#13;
defined single level Resource Rent tax was able to replicate the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
progressivity level of a multi-level system. In the presence of a&#13;
home income tax, however, multiple levels could be used to improve&#13;
progressivity.&#13;
(7) Variation of the cumulation rate for the Resource Rent Tax system&#13;
showed the existence of a trade-off between efficiency and&#13;
progressivity. Efficiency was negatively, and progressivity was&#13;
positively related to the cumulation rate. The trade-off was&#13;
characterized by two well defined segments. In the initial segment,&#13;
as the cumulation rate is raised above the firm discount rate,&#13;
progressivity rises rapidly with only small losses in efficiency.&#13;
In the second segment, lying beyond a critical cumulation rate, the&#13;
position is reversed, with efficiency falling rapidly with little&#13;
gain in progressivity.&#13;
(8) Separate theoretical analysis had suggested that&#13;
Sovereign/Nationalization Risk could be mitigated by a system in&#13;
which the Host Government's Share rose with the value (or size) of&#13;
the reserve discovery for very high value fields. Though&#13;
progressive Resource Rent tax systems were the only ones to have&#13;
this characteristic, it was not enough to reduce Nationalisation&#13;
risk by a significant factor. The reason is that substantial amounts&#13;
of progression occur for small reserve sizes lying well below the&#13;
mean reserve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
(9) Like the multi-level production share systems, systems like Variable&#13;
Profit Share and Variable Royalty, which have continuously varying&#13;
taxes, are also very inefficient. Their efficiency is often worse&#13;
than that of the two level production share system. A more definite&#13;
conclusion is not possible because the precise degree of rate&#13;
progression is very important. These systems are also regressive.&#13;
(10) Except for the resource rent tax systems with cumulation rates&#13;
greater than the firm discount rate, efficiency and progressivity&#13;
are generally positively related. It is therefore generally&#13;
sufficient to look only at their efficiency properties.&#13;
(11) A recent version of the British Petroleum Revenue Tax which allows&#13;
firms not to pay any tax on a specified volume of initial&#13;
production, was found to be less efficient than a Royalty. When the&#13;
allowed volume is reduced to zero the system improves considerably.&#13;
As it stands however, this system will extract competitive rents&#13;
only when the probability of discovery is very low. With better&#13;
prospects all additional revenues go to the firms.&#13;
(12) The use, by the home government, of a Credit instead of a Deduction&#13;
system of foreign source income taxation, made no difference in the&#13;
efficiency ranking of different systems. As expected, much more of&#13;
the resource rent is captured by the host government under the&#13;
Credit than under the Deduction system. Under the credit system,&#13;
the host government should use an effective income tax rate equal to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
that of the home government so as to capture the maximum amount of&#13;
rent. This should be combined with an RRT system with a reasonably&#13;
high cumulation rate to maintain efficiency. For example, with an&#13;
effective home income tax rate of 45% an equal effective host income&#13;
tax can be combined with an RRT system having a cumulation rate up&#13;
to 2.5 times the firm discount rate.&#13;

Appendix 1: THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF&#13;
SOVEREIGN RISK AND OPTIMAL RISK SHARING&#13;
IN NATURAL RESOURCE CONTRACTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
Section A.1: Introduction&#13;
The objective of this brief paper is to explore the problem of&#13;
Sovereign risk in natural resource contracts between host governments and&#13;
foreign firms. In virtually all developed countries, the political-legal&#13;
framework based on a strong belief in private property rights, provides a&#13;
stable tax and contract environment, for both foreign and domestic firms.&#13;
Leland(1979) has analyzed optimal risk sharing between government and firms in&#13;
such an environment. In many developing countries (LDCs) the belief in&#13;
private property rights, especially those of foreign firms, is far from&#13;
absolute. This gives rise to the problem of sovereign risk, which can take&#13;
two forms: The explicit modification of contract terms, as for example&#13;
through nationalization; An implicit change such as through the imposition of&#13;
new taxes on selected sub-sets of firms, as for example an excess profits tax.&#13;
Foreign firms conceive of sovereign risk primarily as political&#13;
risk. This can take the form of a build up of public and political pressure&#13;
which forces a government to change its earlier intentions or in extreme case&#13;
the replacement of the existing government by a more radical one. In other&#13;
words, even if the existing government has no intention of changing contract&#13;
terms, the foreign firm conceives the possibility of changes in socio-&#13;
political environment which would result in such contract changes. In the&#13;
natural resource context there is of course the special problem that the value&#13;
of the tract of land which is the subject of the contract, is unknown at the&#13;
time the contract is signed and becomes known only after an expenditure of&#13;
resources. This gives rise to a pecuLiar dichotomy in socio-political&#13;
perception which is an important factor in the political risk: Ex-post&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
(exploration), the greater the size and value of the natural resource&#13;
discovery, the stronger the perception that there was little ex-ante risk, and&#13;
therefore the more unjustified any returns for risk taking. In other words&#13;
the political risk is positively related to the value of the resource&#13;
discovered, or more specifically to the net return to the firm.&#13;
Eaton and Gersovitz have recently analyzed the problem of a sovereign&#13;
(country) borrower, who willfully defaults under certain circumstances. The&#13;
present note will, however, assume that a host government has no intention, at&#13;
the time it signs the contract, of changing contract terms later. The foreign&#13;
firm perceives a risk of change of contract terms, however, and the host&#13;
government must take account of this perception in devising contract&#13;
terms.!' In section 2 the model is outlined and possible solutions&#13;
presented. In section 3 the note explores how sovereign risk affects&#13;
(optimal) risk sharing between the two parties under different assumptions on&#13;
risk aversion. Some conclusions are presented in section 4.&#13;
Section A.2: The Model&#13;
This note follows the model and notation of Leyland except for the&#13;
introduction of sovereign risk. To shorten the exposition some familiarity&#13;
with his paper is assumed. The foreign firm perceives the possibility of&#13;
imposition of an excess profits tax on its contracted share of the value of&#13;
the tract. For expositional simplicity this tax is taken as unity, making the&#13;
1/   In other words the government does not account for any costs and benefits&#13;
of nationalization in its return calculations.&#13;

q(x)   for x 2 I ' 0,&#13;
0      for x S t&#13;
x(V) = V - P(V), 0 &lt; q(x) S 1                                      (1)&#13;
Where V is the uncertain value of the tract (we assume V &gt; V where V is&#13;
generally negative) P(V) is the payment to the government as a function of the&#13;
value of the tract V, and x(V) is the contracted share of the firm for value&#13;
V. Q is a known constant, below which there is no risk of nationalization&#13;
9 is assumed to be non-negative so as to exclude clearly irrational economic&#13;
behavior. Though penalties against the host government, if it nationalizes,&#13;
are not explicitly considered in the present note, we expect Q to be&#13;
positively related to the minimum penalty such a government would have to pay&#13;
on nationalization. Two types of probability functions are of greatest&#13;
interest: Type 1 for which q(x) &lt; l,q' &gt; 0 and Lim q = b S 1, lim q' = 0&#13;
x,M            xe+&#13;
and type 2 for which q(x) &lt; 1, q'(x) &gt; 0, for Q S x &lt; x and q'(x) =&#13;
0, q(x) = 1 for x &gt; x . The first type of function is most likely to have&#13;
b = 1. That is the probability of nationalization approaches but never quite&#13;
reaches one. If economic factors play any role in the nationalization&#13;
decision, it would seem that, assuming penalties are finite, the probability&#13;
of nationalization must become one at finite x. The type 2 function therefore&#13;
appears to be more likely. Unless otherwise stated, however, all results&#13;
apply to both types.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

We can define an implicit utility function Y(x)21 for the firm, which&#13;
represents the expected utility of the firm at any V, i.e.&#13;
(1 - q(x))U(x) + qU(0)      x &gt; Q&#13;
Y(x) = {&#13;
U(x)                         x S Q&#13;
where U(x) satisfies the usual properties, and U(0) is the utility attained by&#13;
the firms if the natural resource is nationalized. As the government's&#13;
problem is to set P(V) so as to maximize government utility W[P(V)] subject to&#13;
the attainment of some utility level U(h) by the firm, where h a 0.       It is&#13;
useful to rewrite Y(x) by normalizing firm utility U(o) to zero. The&#13;
governments problem is therefore to,&#13;
Max E W[P(V)]   subject to E[Y(x)] a U(h)                            (2)&#13;

U(x)                  for x S Q&#13;
It should be noted that U' &gt; 0, U" &lt; 0 does not insure that Y'&gt; 0&#13;
(and Y" &lt; 0 for x &gt; t).    When U" &lt; 0, Y' = 0 can only arise for a unique&#13;
probability function q(x) depending on the precise form of U(x), and we will&#13;
ignore this case.   When U" = 0, Y" = 0 if q(x) = b(l - Q)     i.e. Y = (1 - b)x&#13;

it has the form,&#13;

Note also that the left hand differential of Y(x) at x = I is given by&#13;
equation 6(b) and the right hand differential by equation 6(a), even though&#13;
the derivative Y' (Q) does not exist for q'(Q) * 0.        At all values of V at&#13;
which P(V) is differentiable and Y' * 0, we can differentiate (4) totally and&#13;
obtain (see Leland)&#13;

as simple as in Leland, because of the discontinuity in the differential of&#13;
Y(x). If we restrict ourselves to the class of continuous solutions four&#13;

A pure bonus is possible only in the very special case in which&#13;
q'(Q) = 0 and Y"(x) = 0 for all x. It is therefore a very special case of&#13;
Step Sharing (type B). If x S Q the hire solution is identical to that in&#13;
Leyland. If x &gt; Q however, expected utility for the firm is apparently&#13;
(1 - q (x))U(x). It seems practically more relevant to assume that payments&#13;
to a firm under a hire arrangement are not subject to nationalization or&#13;
expropriation, i.e. the firm's (expected) utility equals U(x) even in this&#13;
case. We will call this the Pure hire case or Service Contract with&#13;
prepayment. It follows that x = h in the Pure hire scheme. We will assume in&#13;
this note that 2nd order conditions are satisfied. Given the usual conditions&#13;
on the respective utility functions, this implies that the probability&#13;
function q(x) must be such that Y" &lt; 0 for x &gt; i . Thus, for example, if both&#13;
firm and government are risk neutral, we must have 2q'(x) + xq"(x) ' 0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Section A.3: Optimal Risk Sharing under different Risk Aversion Possibilities&#13;
It is useful to start with the case in which the optimal risk sharing&#13;
arrangement is unchanged by the introduction of Sovereign Risk. For this we&#13;
need the following corrolary (see appendix).&#13;
Corrolary 1: If the government is risk neutral, the optimal sharing scheme&#13;
must either have P(V) &gt; V - I or P(V) = V - x for all V.&#13;
It follows that,&#13;
Theorem 1:     If the government is risk neutral and the firm risk averse a&#13;
pure hire scheme with a payment of x = h, to the firm is optimal.&#13;
Proof: From corrolary 1 solutions B and C are excluded. For solution A&#13;
E Y(x) S U(Q),   so that equation 5 is not feasible for h &gt; Q . Therefore the&#13;
V&#13;
solution must be of type D, or a pure hire solution with P(V) = V - h for all&#13;
V.  If h &lt; I    solution A is feasible.   With V - P(V) &lt; I from (8.1) and 6(b)&#13;
we have 1 = XU'(x) , and x = x a constant. Therefore P(V) = V - x = V - h is&#13;
the optimal solution.&#13;
The presence of sovereign risk does not affect optimal sharing. This&#13;
effect is more clearly seen in the other simple case: As the nature of the&#13;
solution depends on whether h &lt; I it is useful to consider this briefly. We&#13;
can define h as the firm rent factor, as it is a measure of the risk adjusted&#13;
profits that the firm requires before it will enter into a contract with the&#13;
government. Therefore h = 0 for a perfectly competitive firm and it increases&#13;
with the degree of rent arising from special information or other factors used&#13;
by the firm to explore for and extract the natural resource. Thus for example&#13;
the degree of rent may be quite high for technically challenging offshore&#13;
tracts. We then have,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
Theorem 2:     If both the government and the firm are risk netural, a pure&#13;
hire solution is optimal if h ' Q, while a sovereign risk avoiding&#13;
solution (Type A) with firm and government indiferent to the degree of&#13;
sharing is optimal if h &lt; Z.&#13;
Proof: In a type A solution E (Y(x)) cannot exceed U(O) . Type B and C&#13;
V&#13;
solutions are ruled out by corrolary 1. Therefore a Type D solution must&#13;
prevail for h &gt; Q and a type A for h 5 Q ('=' implies VA -    ).   For the&#13;
latter case, indifference to the degree of sharing follows from the&#13;
indeterminateness of P(V) in (4).&#13;
In a perfectly competitive environment sovereign risk has the effect&#13;
of restricting the scope of the risk-neutral solution to the no-sovereign risk&#13;
region without affecting its basic form. If the degree of firm rent is&#13;
sufficiently strong (h &gt; Z), it results in a pure hire solution, as this is&#13;
the only way of avoiding the deadweight loss from political risk.&#13;
The more interesting effects arise when government is risk&#13;
averse W" &lt; 0. First we briefly consider the case in which Y'(x) &lt; 0&#13;
for x &lt; L . This is so, for a type 2 probability function for x &gt; x. The&#13;
following corrolary (m is a constant) indicates the solution which will&#13;
prevail (proof in appendix).&#13;
Corrolary 2:   If Y'(x) &lt; 0 for x &gt; m, P(V) &gt; V - m for all V.&#13;
Note that this corrolary assumes that the hire solution is defined with&#13;
Y(x) as in (3). It does not necessarily exclude a pure hire solution with&#13;
Y(x) = U(x) for x &gt; m. Therefore we have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
Theorem 3      If the government is risk averse, and the firms implicit utility&#13;
function is such that Y'(x) &lt; 0 for x &gt; Q   a Sovereign Risk avoiding&#13;
solution is optimal if h &lt; I and a pure hire solution is optimal if h&#13;
This rather special case (Y' &lt; 0) gives results similar to those in&#13;
theorem 2, is consistent with the suceeding discussion, and accords with&#13;
intuition. For the rest of the note we will assume that Y'(x) &gt; 0&#13;
for x &gt; x &gt; Q.      The following corrolary is proved in the appendix (assumes&#13;
Y' &gt; 0).&#13;
Corrolary 3: When the government is risk averse, the Sovereign Risk Avoiding&#13;
solution (A) and Sovereign Risk Taking solution (C) are sub-optimal.&#13;
This is somewhat counter-intuitive given our earlier results. We&#13;
might have expected that solution A would be optimal for h S I as it removes,&#13;
in effect, the problem of sovereign risk. Similarly it might be thought that&#13;
for h &gt; 9 solution C would prevail as it gives as much of the payment to the&#13;
firm in the no-sovereign risk region as possible. This is not true,&#13;
however. As the government is risk averse, it must consider the trade-off&#13;
between avoiding the dead-weight loss from sovereign risk, and the gains from&#13;
risk sharing. What the theorem shows is that the gains from risk sharing&#13;
unambiguously exceed the dead-weight loss. Put somewhat differently, the&#13;
degree and nature of risk sharing can be adjusted so as to make this true.&#13;
This result appears to be essentially similar to that in the absence of&#13;
sovereign risk, except for the possible appearance (if q'(Q) * 0) of an&#13;
intermediate region in which the government bears all the risk&#13;
(VBI &lt; V2 &lt;  VB2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
When the firm is risk neutral, the results are significantly&#13;
different, however. In the absence of sovereign risk a bonus contract would&#13;
prevail, with the firm taking all the risk. In the presence of sovereign&#13;
risk, the marginal payment to the government is still zero (P' = 0) for low&#13;
(including negative) values of V. This implies full risk taking by the firm&#13;
for these values only if the bonus payment is non-negative as in Leyland. In&#13;
the presence of political risk the bonus payment may be negative; in effect a&#13;
service payment which converts the scheme into a "fixed-fee plus a share of&#13;
the profits" type of service contract. When the degree of firm rent is high,&#13;
the fixed fee part may be so large that there is no risk of a loss (fixed fee&#13;
= - V the maximum possible loss). These conditions are most likely to be&#13;
fulfilled for the large oil majors prospecting in difficult offshore areas.&#13;
In practice, factors not considered in the paper may make it optimal for the&#13;
government to postpone exploitation of such a tract to a future date. This&#13;
could be so, for example, if it hopes to be able to acquire the special&#13;
technical expertise over time, without paying the current firm rents. When we&#13;
can ignore the special pure hire solution, defined for h &gt; I in the discussion&#13;
suceeding the four types (A to D), that is for a competitive industry (h = 0),&#13;
or a mildly monopolistic one with Q &gt; 0 i.e. (h &lt; Q ),&#13;
Theorem 4:    When the government is risk averse, the optimum risk sharing&#13;
scheme is the step sharing one (B).&#13;
It seems possible, however, that the pure hire solution for&#13;
h &gt; Q, which is not formally included in the optimization may be superior to&#13;
the step sharing one. We can therefore make the following qualification.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
Corrolary 4.1: When the industry is characterized by large firm-rents,&#13;
(h &gt; Q), a risk averse government may prefer either a step sharing or a&#13;
pure hire contract.&#13;
When the government is risk averse and the industry perfectly competitive&#13;
(more generally h S Q), we can show that (appendix).&#13;
Theorem 5:     An increase (decrease) in sovereign risk leads to a fall (rise)&#13;
in the payments to the government at all V.&#13;
As an increase in sovereign risk does not affect the pure hire solution, we&#13;
also have for a risk averse government.&#13;
Corrolary 5.1: When the industry is characterized by large firm-rents,&#13;
(h &gt; Q ), the possibility of a pure hire contract increases with&#13;
sovereign risk.&#13;
This would suggest that pure hire contracts are more likely for deep&#13;
offshore drilling in LDCs where political risk exists. Few such contracts are&#13;
observed however. There are two possible reasons for this. If the firm rent&#13;
is due to information asymmetry, well known problems of incentives for&#13;
efficient search and production would be particularly severe in a service&#13;
contract. Alternatively, governments are either unable to borrow or face much&#13;
higher interest costs. The latter means that the value of the tract is&#13;
different as seen by the firm and government, and that the gain from&#13;
nationalization may be less than assumed. Both these factors would tend to&#13;
reduce the likelihood of a pure hire solution. As in Leyland we can also show&#13;
that,&#13;
Theorem 6:     An increase in the expected value of the project leads to an&#13;
increase in payments to the government at all V.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
Because of the convex-concave nature of the payment function in B, the effect&#13;
of a change in uncertainty is ambiguous.&#13;
The following results are restricted to probability functions of type&#13;
2. Asuming Y'(x) &gt; 0 for x &lt; x , and with government risk averse we can show;&#13;
Theorem 7:    P'(V) must increase for 'sufficiently large' increases in V, and&#13;
approach one as V aproaches infinity.&#13;
From Leyland we know that the sign of P" can only be analytically determined&#13;
for special utility functions. Theorem 7 gives more definite results: In the&#13;
presence of sovereign risk, in which the probability of nationalization&#13;
becomes one at a finite V, the marginal payment to the government (P') must&#13;
gradually start increasing and approach 100%. As noted earlier this is the&#13;
type of probability function which appears more likely to prevail.&#13;
Finally consider the class of power functions for which Leland's&#13;
analysis gave definite conclusions about the shape of the payment function.&#13;
That is&#13;
U(Y) 5     yy            ° &lt; Y &lt; l,&#13;
Of particular interest is the effect of sovereign risk in the presence of a&#13;
type 1 probability function. The simplest example of this type of function is&#13;
the following sub-class parametrized by the parameter 6, where&#13;
q  1   ()                     F&#13;
x                    f&#13;
where yF is the risk aversion parameter of the firm.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
For these two sets of functions, it is easily shown (following&#13;
Leland) that in the sovereign risk region i.e. x &gt; Q, the payment schedule&#13;
will be convex as long as&#13;
y&gt;  -Y F   6&#13;
where yG is the risk aversion parameter of the government. In other words,&#13;
when the optimal payment schedule without sovereign risk is convex, it will&#13;
continue to be convex with sovereign risk. In addition there will be a range&#13;
of relative absolute risk aversions over which the presence of sovereign risk&#13;
will convert the optimal schedule from a concave to a convex one. The higher&#13;
the degree of sovereign risk, as measured by 6, the greater will be the range&#13;
of relative risk aversion over which the optimal schedule is convex.&#13;
Section A.4: Conclusion&#13;
The paper showed how the effect of political risk on the optimal&#13;
sharing scheme depends on the nature of competition in the market. Given a&#13;
perfectly competitive market, the modified optimum for a risk neutral&#13;
government is different from that for a risk averse government. In the former&#13;
case, the sharing scheme is modified where necessary, to eliminate the&#13;
political risk for the firm. In the latter case, it is not, in general,&#13;
optimum to eliminate sovereign risk. The reason for this asymmetry is that&#13;
the gains from risk sharing (when positive), outweigh the deadweight loss from&#13;
political risk. The exception is a special case in which political risk rises&#13;
so rapidly with firm returns, that the implicit marginal utility of returns&#13;
to the firm becomes zero. In this case there is nothing to be gained at all&#13;
from having the firm take political risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
When the industry is characterized by firm-rents the above results&#13;
may still apply, unless it becomes impossible to satisfy the firm rent&#13;
requirements without taking political risk. In this case an alternative pure&#13;
hire scheme with (fixed) advance payments to the firm could result. In other&#13;
words, even ignoring the special case, the gains from sharing do not&#13;
necessarily outweigh the deadweight loss when the market is characterized by&#13;
rents.&#13;
The model of political risk analyzed here, may be viewed as an&#13;
example of informational asymmetry or differential subjective judgment. The&#13;
firm perceives a risk of nationalization but the government does not. If&#13;
expectations were not totally asymmetric, the government would take account of&#13;
the returns from nationalization. This would tend to increase the gains of&#13;
risk sharing, but is unlikely to affect the form of the competitive&#13;
solution. It would however reduce the possibility of a pure hire solution and&#13;
increase the range (of firm rents) over which the solution with firm rents is&#13;
similar to the perfectly competitive one.&#13;

Corrolary 1:   If W" = 0, either P(V) &gt; V - I for all V or P(V) = V + x for all&#13;
V.&#13;
Proof:         From (4) of text, 'L = 1 - XY'(V - P(V))     Z(V)   (say), for each&#13;
V.&#13;
First consider the case in which Y"&lt; 0.    Let P(V) &lt; V - 9. . Z(V) cannot be&#13;
greater than zero if P(V) would rise to V - Q .     If Z(V) &lt; 0, P would fall&#13;
towards  -   . Now   Lim Y'(V - P) = 0 i.e., Lim    dL = 1 &gt; 0 a contradiction.&#13;
2a&#13;
Therefore Z(V) = 0 and P (V) = V + Y' 1(l) = V - x (say).     It follows that for&#13;
all V for which P(V) &lt; V - Q , P(V) = V - x.     For a continuous solution&#13;
P'(V) = 1, and therefore P(V) = V - x for all V.     Next consider the case in&#13;
which Y" = 0. If U" &lt; 0, Y" equals zero for a unique probability function&#13;
depending on the precise shape of U(x). We will therefore ignore this case.&#13;
If U" = 0, Y" = 0 implies q(K) = b(l - Q/x) and Y' = 1 - b, b&lt; 1.     Therefore&#13;
if P(V) &lt; V - Q, Z(V) = 1 - A(1 - b) = 0 for a finite solution.     That is&#13;
A = l   b &gt; 1.   If P(V)   V -    we must have 1   -    0 or X = 1.    If both&#13;
P(V) ' V - Q and P(V) &lt; V - Q are feasible solutions, with both firm and&#13;
government risk neutral, global optimality requires that P(V) &gt; V - Q for all&#13;
V.&#13;
Corrolary 2:   If Y' &lt; 0 for x &gt; x   (a constant), P(V) &gt; V - x   for all V.&#13;
Proof:         Suppose that to the contrary, P(V) &lt; V - x" (i.e. x &gt; x ) for&#13;
V = V .    Therefore Z(V )    W'(P) - XY'(x) &gt; 0  for finite P, by&#13;
assumption on W'. Therefore L and the banks expected utility&#13;
can be increased by raising P above V - x , a contradiction.&#13;
Therefore P(V*) 4 - x*.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Theorem 3:     If W" &lt; 0 and Y' &lt; 0 for x &gt; I , solution type A is optimal if&#13;
h &lt; Q , and the pure hire solution is optimal if h &gt; Q.&#13;
Proof          Consider the case with h &lt; Q . From corrolary 2 P(V) &gt; V&#13;
- Q for all V. This rules out solutions of type B and C.&#13;
Further EY(x) = EU(x) S U(Q).     As U(h) &lt; U(Q), solutions A and&#13;
V       V&#13;
D are both feasible. The latter solution is given by P(V) = V -&#13;
h. As it is a continuous interior solution, it must satisfy&#13;
equation (4) (Z(V) = 0) for all V. But Z(V) = W'(P)&#13;
- XY' &gt; 0 for all V, a contradiction. Therefore A must be the&#13;
optimal solution.   Next consider h &gt; Q . Solution A is no&#13;
longer feasible, solution D is given by P(V) = V - x with x &gt; h&#13;
and the pure hire solution by P(V) = V - h.    Therefore the pure&#13;
hire solution must be optimal.&#13;
Corrolary 3:   A and C solutions are sub-optimal when W" &lt; 0 and Y" &lt; 0&#13;
(Y' &gt; 0),&#13;
Proof:         If A is optimal, from equation 8.3 we must have&#13;
3p|-P   W'(P) - XA Y'(V - P) 2 0   fo   ()=V-Q,V &gt; VA'&#13;
Now Z(V) = W'(V -      - x Y'(Q) and Lim W'(V - Q) = 0.     Therefore Z(V) &gt; 0&#13;
AV&#13;
for all V &gt; VA implies Y'(L) &lt; 0, and Y'(x) &lt; 0 for all x as Y" &lt; 0. This is&#13;
a contradiction. Therefore A cannot be optimal. If C is optimal, we must&#13;
have from equations (10.3).&#13;
AL    c= W'(P) - A U'(V - P) S 0 for P(V) = V - Q , V &lt; Vc&#13;
i.e. Z(v) = W'(V - Q ) - A U'(Q) S 0 or X    &gt; w'(v - z)   for V &lt; V&#13;
C               C     u'(9.)             C&#13;
&#13;

From equation 10.2 Xc =      U(Q)    which is less than Wv__     - ) for V &lt; V  by&#13;
concavity of W.   This is contradiction.    Therefore c cannot be optimal.&#13;
Theorem 4:     With w" &lt; 0, solution B is optimal&#13;
Proof: From corrolary 3 solution A and C are non-optimal. consider D&#13;
when x * Q, the hire solution is optimal only if it satisfies equation (4).&#13;
That is W'(V - x) - )D Y'(M) = 0 which is only possible for one V given the&#13;
strict concavity of W. Therefore D cannot be optimal. If x = Q, on putting&#13;
11.1 in 11.2 and 11.3 we have&#13;
w'(v    )  &gt;    &gt; W'(V -   ) for all V Lim W'(V - L) = 0,&#13;
This can hold for all V if XD = 0, i.e. there is no effective constraint.&#13;
Therefore the hire solution cannot be optimal formally leaving only the step-&#13;
sharing one.&#13;
Theorem 5:     When W" &lt; 0   aP(V)/aq S 0 for all V, for solution B.&#13;
Proof: We have for solution B,&#13;
E Y(x) = f    u(v - P)f(V)dV + fvB2U(V - Q)f(V)dV + fV     Y(V - P)f9U)dV&#13;
V          -                      Bi                    ye2B&#13;
=   f-    U(x)  aq   f(V)dV -      Y'(x) 3P(V) dV = 0, as      = U(h).&#13;
3q  ~  V           q               B2        a &#13;
This means that at ) must be negative for some V. There are two possibil-&#13;
ities a(      &lt; 0 for V  &lt; VBl or V   &gt; VB2.   If V  &lt; IB1V  from equation 9.1 we&#13;
have, for a rise in q     XB is the new XAB )'&#13;
X=  W'[(P(V      &gt;         W(P(V )        by strict concavity of W.&#13;
U'[V  - P(V )     B    U'[V* - P(V)]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
From equations 9.1 and 9.3 and the concavity of W' it follows that P(V) &gt; P(V)&#13;
for all V for which P(V) * V - Q, and P(V) a P(V) for P(V) = V - Q.      A&#13;
similar reasoning applies if V &gt; VB2.&#13;
If the old distribution (and solution) is n and the new distribution&#13;
(and solution) is m, we can define, following Leland an increase in expected&#13;
value of the project as EmY(V - Pn(V)l &gt; EnY[V - Pn(V)I. For W" &lt; 0&#13;
Y" &lt; 0, Y' &gt; 0, we have,&#13;
Theorem 6:     IF EMY(V   Pn ) &gt; EnY(V - Pd) = U(h), then Pm(V) &gt; Pn(V) for all&#13;
V.&#13;
Proof:  As EMY(V - Pm)    U(h), Pm(V) &gt; Pn(V) for at least one V.    If&#13;
Pm(V) &gt; Pn(V) for V = V   it can be shown as above thatX m &lt;    mand&#13;
Pm(V) 2 Pn(V) for all V.&#13;
For probability functions of type 2, with government risk averse, we&#13;
have for solutions of type B, the following results (Corrolary 6, 7, 8).&#13;
Corrolary 6:   P(V) &gt; V - x  for all finite V &gt; VB2, where x    &lt; x such that&#13;
Y'(x) S 0 for all x 2 x and Y' &gt; 0 for all x &lt; x.&#13;
Proof:  ay                 = (1 - qG)] U'(x) - q'(x) Ux)       -U()     0&#13;
As Y" S 0, there exists a x * &lt; x such that Y'(x) &gt; 0 for x &lt; x* and Y'(x) &lt; 0&#13;
for x &gt; x . The case in which x    = Q has already been dealt with in Theorem&#13;
3, and is not of interest here.   If x   &gt; Q solution B was shown to be optimal&#13;
in theorem 4 (ignoring the exogenous pure hire solution for h &gt; g ).     By&#13;
corrolary 2, we have t &lt; x S x for all V &gt; VB2. Equations 9.3 and (7) apply&#13;
for all V for which x * x , so that 0 5 P'(V) S 1 for such V.     Given the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
restriction to continuous solutions, there are two possibilities. Either&#13;
x &lt; x  for all V, or there exists a VB3 &gt; VB2 such that P(V) = V - x     for all&#13;
V &gt; VB3. Assume first that the latter solution is optimal. Then an equation&#13;
like 8.3 must apply for V &gt; BE3, i.e. Z(V) E (V - x*) - XY'(X ) = W'(V - x ) S 0&#13;
But W'(V - x ) &gt; 0 for all finite V, a contradiction.     Therefore x &lt; x  or&#13;
P(V) &gt; V - x* for all V.&#13;
Note: That from equation (7) and its succeeding discussion, 0 S P'(V) S 1 for&#13;
all V &gt; I .&#13;
Corrolary 7:   P(V) &lt; V &lt; m   and P is finite for finite V.&#13;
Proof:  This follows from the fact that P(V) = V - Q at V = VB2 and&#13;
0 S P'(V) &lt; 1 for all V &gt; VB2.&#13;
Corrolary 8: P'(V) &lt; 1 for finite V.&#13;
Proof: From corrolary 7 P(V) is finite for finite V, and therefore W'(P) &lt; 0&#13;
for all V &lt; m * As Y'     0 for all x &lt; x . Therefore&#13;
ARG            (-w11)Y'  -1&#13;
P (V) =    1 + ABA  ]-1 = [1 +   -- Y   ]   &lt; 1&#13;
Theorem 7.1: For each V &gt; VB2 there exists VO ' V such that P'(Vo) - P'(V) &gt;&#13;
0.&#13;
Proof:  Consider V = V1 &gt; V.2, and assume the contrary, i.e. P'(V)     S P'(V1)&#13;
for all V &gt; V1.   Therefore P(V) S P(V1) + P'(V1)(V - V1) where P(V1) &lt;     from&#13;
corrolary 7.   Now the right hand side equals V - x   at Vm   = (P(V) +x    -&#13;
V1P'(Vd)/(l - P'(V1)) as P'(V1) &lt; 1. That is P(V) &lt; V - x for V &lt; Vm. This&#13;
contradicts corrolary 6.   Therefore there exists VO &lt; V such that P'(V1W  ) &gt;&#13;
P'(V1).&#13;
Theorem 7.2:    Lim P'(V) = 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
Proof: By contradiction. Assume Lim P'(V) = a &lt; 1 . By the continuity&#13;
x4     *&#13;
assumption (applies for all x: I &lt; x &lt; x ), there exists a Vm and&#13;
a 6 &lt; 1 a such that a - 6 S P'(V) S a + 6 &lt; 1 for all V &#142; Vm. Now PM =&#13;
P(VM ) &lt; m , and P(V) S PmR + (a + 6)(V - Vm) for all V &gt; Vm. As a + 6 &lt; 1.&#13;
The right hand side must intersect V - x for finite V, so that P(V) &lt; V - x&#13;
for some finite V. This contradicts corrolary 6, therefore a j 1. As&#13;
0 S P(V) S 1 for all V1 by continuity a = 1.&#13;

RESOURCE RENT TAX&#13;
In the RRT system the tax base is calculated by cumulating expenditures&#13;
and revenues at a specific interest rate. Each year an annual cash flow is&#13;
figured:&#13;
cash flow = gross revenue - operating cost - royalty payments -&#13;
exploration expenses - development expense.&#13;
In the intital years of exploration and development, the annual cash&#13;
flows are negative. When production revenues start to come in the annual&#13;
flows become positive, and at some point the accumulated value of the flows&#13;
becomes positive. At this point (zero cash flow point) and beyond the tax is&#13;
imposed.&#13;
The model is structured to allow for three different rates of&#13;
accumulation. The cumulation with the lowest rate will reach the zero cash&#13;
flow point soonest and the tax will be levied first at the associated rate.&#13;
The other cumulations occur simultaneously at successively higher rates. In&#13;
addition to the normal cumulation of costs and revenues at these higher rates,&#13;
any previous RRT payments that the firm makes are subtracted from the&#13;
iccumulation. The combination of a higher accumulation rate and the deduction&#13;
if prior RRT payments will delay the imposition of the tax at the second and&#13;
third levels.&#13;
An effective tax rate can be calculated using the following formula:&#13;
effective rate - RRTRI + RRTR2(1-RRTR1) + RRTR3[1-RRTR1-RRTR2(1-RRTR1)]&#13;
(RRTR1,2,3 are the three tax rates)&#13;
For example, if RRT rates of .25, .50 and .75 were all being levied, the&#13;
effective rate would be:&#13;
.25 + .50(1-.25) + .75(1-.25-.50(1-.25))&#13;
- .25 +     .375    +    .281             -   .906&#13;
The RRT does not qualify for the U.S. foreign income tax credit.&#13;

BRITISH PETROLEUM REVENUE TAX&#13;
The PRT is a special type of profit share system. Its characteristics&#13;
are the following:&#13;
4epreciation&#13;
No depreciation is allowed in figuring the tax base.&#13;
Oil Allowance&#13;
In any of the first ten years of the lease (covering the period of&#13;
exploration, development and production build-up) revenues from the first 7.3&#13;
million barrels of oil produced are not taxed. [This formulation of the oil&#13;
allowance differs from that given by the authors of a book on U.K. taxation&#13;
which is: a total of 78 million barrels are allowed the firm before it is&#13;
taxed, the maximum allowance for any one year being 7.8 million barrels; there&#13;
is no specification the allowance only apply for the first 10 years of the&#13;
lease.]&#13;
Capital Uplift Factor (BPF)&#13;
The firm can recover all its exploration and development costs before&#13;
being taxed.* The PRT system permits these costs to be uplifted by the factor&#13;
BPF as shown:&#13;
BPA - (EXX + RINV) * BPF&#13;
In our experiments we have used uplift factors of between 1.2 and 2.0 (1.75 is&#13;
the rate used by the British).&#13;
The tax rate can be fixed of variable, and is calculated in the same way&#13;
as for the profit share system described elsewhere. Once this rate is&#13;
calculated, two constraints must be satisfied.&#13;
1. If net revenue is less than 30% of total investment costs, no tax is&#13;
levied.&#13;
IF (NTREV2.LT.PT) PRFSH - 0&#13;
where PT - .3 * (EXX + RINV)&#13;
2. If net revenue exceeds 30% of total investment costs, the tax is&#13;
constrained not to exceed 80% of the amount by which annual profits exceed 30%&#13;
of total investment costs. This condition is summarized by the following&#13;
o ation:&#13;
i.e. NTREV2 must be adjusted.   Therefore in subsequent equations NTREV2=O till&#13;
all uplifted costs have been recovered. (note that this acts as a&#13;
variable accumulation Rate).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
IF (NTREV2.GT.PT) PRFSH - AMIN1 [PRFSH, .8 (NTREV2 - PT)]&#13;
The system can be represented by the following graph:&#13;
TAX&#13;
NET REVENUE&#13;
O                   ft#,r4.4T&#13;
The tax is imposed at three levels. When net revenue is less or equal to A no&#13;
tax is levied. This represents the first constraint. When net revenue is&#13;
between A and B' the tax is given by the equation of the line ABD:&#13;
TAX - .8 * (NTREV2 - PT)&#13;
This equation represents the second constraint. When net revenue exceeds B'&#13;
the tax is given by the equation of the line OBC:&#13;
TAX - PFSHRT * (NTREV2)&#13;
One can see that as PFSHRT is raised, OBC will shift upwards, for&#13;
example, to ODE.   The second constraint would then apply between A and D'.    If&#13;
we continue to raise PFSHRT, the constraint applies at progressively higher&#13;
levels of net revenue. When PFSHRT reaches .80 and beyond the second&#13;
constraint applies at all levels of net revenue. In effect, the PRT on its&#13;
own is limited by this constraint in Its ability to raise government revenue&#13;
(a result seen clearly in the experiments).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
PRODUCTION SHARE&#13;
Cost oil&#13;
The firm is allowed to subtract a certain percentage of annual oil&#13;
roduction from its total in order to recover the costs os exploration and&#13;
develuopment.  This is called "cost oil".  There are two constraints operating&#13;
to limit the amount of costs the firm can recover in any one year. First, the&#13;
cost oil must not exceed a certain percentage of total production. In our&#13;
experiments this percentage (CSTFAC) ranges between 20 and 100. Second, a&#13;
minimum number of years are required for cost recovery. This minimum (NYCT)&#13;
is set between one and eight years. In the normal case these constraints&#13;
dictate that the firm may recover costs up to 40% of total production in any&#13;
one year, with the recovery stretched over a period of at least four years.&#13;
Profit oil&#13;
The oil remaining after cost oil is deducted, less operating costs, is&#13;
called "profit oil".&#13;
Rate structure&#13;
The model has provisions for a six-step rate structure. In practice, a&#13;
one- or two-step system is used. The sharing rate in a multi-tiered system is&#13;
tied directly to yearly production levels. As an example of a two level&#13;
system:&#13;
A company produces 100,000 barrels of oil per day. The government's&#13;
share of the profit oil is 50% of the first 50,000 barrels produced&#13;
and 75% of the next 50,000 barrels produced&#13;
Income tax&#13;
In the model there are provisions for two types of income tax.&#13;
The first is called the 'grossing up' method (described in Tyner's book&#13;
on the Indian tax system).&#13;
TAXFR - PRODSR/(1 - TAXF) - PRODSH&#13;
tax payment = net revenue/(l - tax rate) - net revenue&#13;
The firm's true are earnings are inflated by dividing by 1 minus the tax rat!&#13;
so that there is no effect on the firm's actual earnings.    This type of tax  s&#13;
used to take advantage of the U.S. tax credit laws by transferring tax&#13;
payments from the U.S. government to the host government.&#13;
The second method is the conventional income tax:&#13;
TAXH - PHIH * (PRODSH + COSTOIL - OPC - DEPPDI)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
PROD. SHARE&#13;
tax payments - tax rate * (gross revenues - government's share of&#13;
profit oil - operating costs - depreciation)&#13;
In figuring home country income tax two methods can be used:&#13;
1.   TAX = PHI * (PRODSH + CSTOIL - OPC - DEPPD1) - PHI * (TAXH)&#13;
Income tax paid by the firm to the host country is treated as a&#13;
deduction.&#13;
2.   TAX = PHI * (PRODSH + CSTOIL - OPC - DEPPD1) + TAXFR * PHI&#13;
Tax paid to the home government is&#13;
TAX - AMAX(O,TAX - TAXFFR)&#13;
where TAX - TAXFR = PRODSH - (1-PHI)*PRODSH/(1-TAXF) + PHI(CSTOIL-OPC-DEPPD1).&#13;
In most cases, the firm will pay home country tax up to the point when TAXF&#13;
PHI. It makes no sense for the host government to raise TAXF above PHI since&#13;
the firm has exhausted all of its benefit from the tax credit.&#13;
Operation of Constraints&#13;
A more detailed description of the two constraints follows.&#13;
BPAX - BPA/NYCT&#13;
BPA is total costs and NYCT is minimum time for cost recovery. BPAX is the&#13;
maximum amount of costs that can be recovered in the years in which the NYCT&#13;
constraint operates.&#13;
CSTOIL = CSTFAC * OILVAL - OPC&#13;
This is the initial value of CSTOIL. The program first checks to see how this&#13;
value compares with BPAX:&#13;
1)     If CSTOIL LT BPAX (if CSTOIL falls short of the limit set by the&#13;
NYCT constraint) then CRYOIL = CRYOIL + BPAX - CSTOIL. CRYOIL is the&#13;
cumulated value of the oil which can be deducted under the NYCT&#13;
constraint but is not deducted because of the CSTFAC constraintIAPfn this&#13;
case the equation for profit oil becomes:&#13;
PFTOIL = 1 - CSTFAC&#13;
2)     If CSTOIL   BPAX then PFTOIL    1 - CSTFAC&#13;
3)     IF CSTOIL GT BPAX then CSTOIL   AMINI(CSTOIL, (BPAX + CRYOIL).   So&#13;
the value of CSTOIL is the minimum of CSTOIL or BPAX + CRYOIL. We know&#13;
that BPAX + CRYOIL is the value limit set under the NYCT constraint plus&#13;
the accumulated value of oil that was not allowed to be deducted&#13;
previously because of CSTFAC constraints. The CRYOIL is adjusted as&#13;
follows: CRYOIL - CRYOIL - (CSTOIL - BPAX). The new value for CRYOIL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
PROD. SHARE&#13;
will be zero if CSTOIL exceeds BPAX +CRYOILC2)it will be reduced by the&#13;
amo)unt that CSTOIL exceeds BPAX. The following diagrams show how this&#13;
works.&#13;

cAb'~     A-&#13;
Let's look at the case where the CSTFAC constraint keeps CSTOIL below the&#13;
value of BPAX for all periods where the NYCT holds. Then the value of CRYOIL&#13;
at the end of minimum cost recovery period is the remainder of costs that can&#13;
be deducted. The CSTFAC constraint then is the only operative constraint at&#13;
this point. The equation for CSTOIL is:&#13;
CSTOIL - AMIN1 (CSTOIL, CRYOIL)&#13;
If CRYOIL GT CSTOIL then there will still be something to deduct next year.&#13;
If CRYOIL LT CSTOIL then all the deduction is used up. This case is shown&#13;
below.&#13;

PROFIT SHARE (GOVERNMENT'S PROFIT SHARE)&#13;
Two types of profit share are examined, fixed and variable.&#13;
FIXED PROFIT SHARE&#13;
The taxable income base for the profit share is calculated by subtracting&#13;
operatiog costs, depreciation and royalty payments from gross revenues:&#13;
PFBAS - GRREV - OPC - DEPPD1 - RPFS&#13;
In addition, the firm is allowed to recover fully its exploration and&#13;
development costs before the tax is levied. The allowance is given by the&#13;
formula:&#13;
BPA - (EXX + RINV) * BPF&#13;
We set BPF - 1.0; EXX - total exploration cost; RINV - total development cost.&#13;
The government's share is given by the equation:&#13;
PRFSH - PFSRAT * PFBAS&#13;
profit share - rate * taxable income base&#13;
VARIABLE PROFIT SHARE&#13;
The variable profit share operates with four inputs:&#13;
PFSHRT - minimum profit share rate&#13;
PRTMAX - maximum profit share rate&#13;
PRTFAC - factor which changes profit share rate based upon&#13;
level of net annual income&#13;
PSBASE - threshold level of net annual income below which profit&#13;
share rate remains at the minimum&#13;
Net income is defined by the equation:&#13;
PFBAS - GRREV - OPC - DEPPD1 - RPFSK&#13;
When net income in any year exceeds PSBASE, PSBASE is subtracted from net&#13;
income&#13;
PFBASI - PFBAS - PSBASE&#13;
ind the resulting number is used in the following equation to caclulate the&#13;
change in the profit share rate:&#13;
*NOTE: BPF is set equal to O.O(for KPF.lI)for the Profit Share System used by us.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
PFSRAT = PFSHRT + PRTFAC * PFBAS1/l.OO,OO&#13;
After checking that the new rate does not exceed the maximum, the government's&#13;
share is calculated&#13;
PRFSH = PFSRAT * PFBAS&#13;
using the same equation as in the fixed system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
ROYALTY&#13;
The royalty rate can be fixed or variable. The two systems are described&#13;
below.&#13;
Fixed Royalty&#13;
RPFS = RLAMV * GRREV&#13;
Royalty payment = tax rate * gross revenue&#13;
No deductions are permitted before applying the tax.&#13;
Variable Royalty&#13;
The rate variation can be either production or revenue based. Four&#13;
inputs are needed:&#13;
ROYRT  = initial or minimum royalty rate&#13;
RRTMAX - maximum royalty rate&#13;
ROYFAC - factor which changes royalty rate based on annual&#13;
production or revenue&#13;
PRODF  - threshold level of production (or revenue) below which&#13;
royalty rate remains unchanged at the minimum&#13;
For the production based system, the rate is calculated as follows:&#13;
PRODU = (Total annual production - PRODF)/1,000,000&#13;
the new rate:&#13;
RLAMV - ROYRT + ROYFAC * PRODU&#13;
For the revenue based system, the steps are:&#13;
PRODU - (Gross Revenue - PRODF)/1,000,000&#13;
the new rate:&#13;
RLAMV   ROYRT + ROYFAC * PRODU&#13;
Each time the program checks that the new rate does not exceed the maximum,&#13;
RRTMAX. The tax is calculated in the same way as in the fixed rate case:&#13;
RPFS - RLAMV * GRREV&#13;
&#13;

            The paper analyzes the efficiency of
            several tax-contract systems, such as the resource rent tax,
            production share system, and royalty. Account is taken of
            their incentive effects on behaviour of firms under
            different economic and geological conditions, with
            particular emphasis on areas where prospects are relatively
            poor. The paper shows the strengths and weaknesses of
            systems widely used or recommended for oil exploration and
            production in developing countries. An analysis of the
            problem of nationalization risk is also carried out, and
            some light shed on which of the these systems is best able
            to cope with this problem.
