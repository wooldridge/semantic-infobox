&#13;
A Core Course on Macroeconomic Management: New Methods and Current Policy Issues&#13;
was held in Washington, D. C. from February 17 - 27, 1998. This was the first of five course&#13;
sessions planned for presentation during calendar year 1998 by EDIMP. The primary goal of&#13;
these course offerings is to enhance the capacity of participants to use modern analytical&#13;
tools to analyze current macroeconomic policy issues. Forty-one participants attended this&#13;
course session, consisting mainly of professional macroeconomists, including Bank staff,&#13;
government policy advisors, university professors, and academic and non-academic&#13;
researchers. The session was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit using an end-of-course&#13;
questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of two main sections. One section asked&#13;
participants to rate aspects of the course on the extent that the course met standard&#13;
performance criteria. These performance criteria included the level and quality of support&#13;
provided by course sponsors, the ability of presenters and appropriateness of course&#13;
materials, and the degree to which participants felt they had received suitable training. The&#13;
second main section asked participants to rate their level of information or knowledge about&#13;
topics covered in the course, before and after completing the course. This attempted to&#13;
measure achievement through participant self-assessment. A 5-point Likert type scale that&#13;
ranged from 1 = minimum to 5 = maximum was used to rate participant response for each&#13;
item. Following is a summary of these evaluation results:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Overall rating for the course's performance in different areas was high. Given that the&#13;
        scale's theoretical mid-point is 3.0, the mean score for all items was above that point.&#13;
        This is even more significant, given the large number of items used in the evaluation.&#13;
        These findings suggest that for all of the indicators assessed, including content and&#13;
        delivery, participants expressed a high level of satisfaction with the course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  A key indicator of course performance is the question that asks participants if this&#13;
        course was a worthwhile use of their time. On this indicator, results were extremely&#13;
        favorable. Participant mean score was 4.57 out of 5.0. This was one of the highest&#13;
        ratings received in this evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Consistently high course ratings were given to items measuring course content.&#13;
        These included the extent to which the course provided new information and its&#13;
        relevance to participants' work. These received mean scores of 4.33 and 4.39 out of&#13;
        5.0, among the highest scores received in this evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Several items stand out for their relatively low mean scores. Two of these items&#13;
        related to course content. One was the extent participants felt they learned suitable&#13;
        policy options. The other was whether the course helped improve analytical skills.&#13;
        These areas are important because they are central to the course objective. Greater&#13;
        focus should be given these areas in future presentations.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
lPre/post self-assessment learning questions show substantial gain for all items.&#13;
 These items were selected as issues that the course attempted to impart to&#13;
 participants. This consistent gain suggests that participants felt they did learn what&#13;
 the course's designers anticipated they would learn.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lOn one item in particular, participants indicated that their pre-course knowledge was&#13;
 relatively low. This was on the issue of currency stabilization, dollarization and&#13;
 monetary management. The mean score on this item was well below the scale's&#13;
 midpoint at 2.43. There was a substantial post-course increase, where the mean&#13;
 score rose to 3.78.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lPre-course mean scores were generally in the high 2.0 to 3.0-range. This measure&#13;
 can serve as an indicator of how much participants felt they knew about a topic upon&#13;
 entering the course. Its value is that it attempts to assess this level of information only&#13;
 after the course was completed. A high score on the pre-test would suggest that this&#13;
 topic should be reviewed for its contribution to new information for participants. The&#13;
 findings from this course show that, with one possible exception, these scores were&#13;
 not high enough to suggest that participants felt they knew a great deal about any of&#13;
 the topics upon entering the course. This one exception was on the topic of fiscal&#13;
 policy, public debt and sustainability, where the pre-course mean score was generally&#13;
 higher at 3.26. It rose to 4.04 in the post-course indicator.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe consistent gain in pre/post information reported by participants should be&#13;
 interpreted with caution. These gains were impressive and do reflect the belief by&#13;
 participants that they received a great deal from this course. However, it is not a valid&#13;
 measure of what was actually learned by participants. Future course offerings would&#13;
 benefit from developing and administering cognitively based questions capable of&#13;
 assessing what was truly learned by participants in the course, as opposed to what&#13;
 they feel they gained.&#13;

            A core course on macroeconomic
            management: new methods and current policy issues was held
