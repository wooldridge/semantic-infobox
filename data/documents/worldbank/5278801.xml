The priority actions suggested by the Millennium Development Goals and the World Summit on&#13;
Sustainable Development to enhance access to safe water supply and basic sanitation pose new&#13;
challenges to the sector, and provide new opportunities to make significant progress on poverty&#13;
reduction. While additional financial resources will help to meet these challenges, infrastructure&#13;
investments alone do not ensure sustainability, efficient use of existing resources, community and&#13;
private sector participation, better and sustained access to services, and increased coverage for all.&#13;
&#13;
    To ensure progress, we must put in place appropriate and effective financing mechanisms that&#13;
leverage the needed change, promote and support sector reforms that yield effective institutional&#13;
frameworks, guarantee appropriate use of limited public resources, and encourage well-targeted&#13;
subsidies to achieve equity.&#13;
&#13;
    This paper, a review and synthesis of innovative financing in the water and sanitation sector,&#13;
emphasizes the critical importance of mechanisms that (1) promote and support sound policies and&#13;
reform (2) leverage more domestic resources from providers, users, and local governments and&#13;
(3) help to improve the use of subsidies for the poor. The paper also identifies key issues that can guide&#13;
the choice of financing mechanisms in different contexts.&#13;
&#13;
    A number of ongoing activities and projects of the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and the&#13;
World Bank contribute to this priority area: decentralization and WSS service delivery, the new&#13;
emerging thinking on output-based aid, increases in user financing even in rural water supply systems,&#13;
assessment of resource flows and sector financing, use of guarantees to support enhanced private&#13;
investments, and small and medium enterprises in service provision.&#13;
&#13;
    As different stakeholders gain and share new experiences, our collective ability to deliver improves.&#13;
This paper is an important contribution to the process.&#13;

      Three key concerns are important in                                      among local governments. Examples of three such&#13;
influencing the design of a transfer system: (a) it                            specific transfer schemes for each objective are&#13;
must be ensured that the transfers do                                          discussed below. These provide an idea of the&#13;

mobilization (b) the system needs to be simple,                                specific objectives. It is important to note that in&#13;

Key lessons emerging from this and the experience                              levels of government (national or regional) may&#13;
of other developing countries include: (a) the                                 give conditional grants with a provision that the&#13;

&#13;
                        Fiscal Framework to Support Decentralization: Lessons from India&#13;
&#13;
       Though local authorities (LAs) have existed in India for a long time, it was only in 1994, 47 years after&#13;
       independence, that they attained a constitutional status through the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment&#13;
       Acts (CAAs). Within the Indian federal system, however, determination of the functional mandates and fiscal&#13;
       powers of local authorities still rests with the state legislatures. As regards the fiscal powers of the LAs, the&#13;
       CAAs provide for State Finance Commissions (SFCs) to be set up by each state government every five years.&#13;
       The SFC is entrusted with the task of reviewing the fiscal position of LAs and making recommendations as to&#13;
       the measures needed to improve their financial position. It gives due consideration to the principles governing&#13;
       (a) the distribution between the state and the LAs of the net proceeds of the taxes, duties, and fees levied by the&#13;
       state (b) the determination of taxes, duties, and fees that may be assigned to or appropriated by the LAs and&#13;
       (c) the grants-in-aid to LAs from the consolidated funds of the state. The first set of SFCs was appointed in&#13;
       1994. Most state legislatures have accepted their recommendations, though they have often not been implemented&#13;
       fully. In most states, the second SFCs are also now in place.&#13;
             The experience so far in India on the key elements of fiscal decentralization illustrates the following:&#13;
       s Expenditure responsibilities. The 11th and 12th Schedules of the CAA suggest functions for devolution to&#13;
            local authorities, though the power to do so is actually vested in the state governments through panchayat&#13;
            and municipal legislation. The actual assignment of functions varies in different states and has depended&#13;
            also on past institutional legacies. Though LAs have a clear mandate of responsibility for WSS-related&#13;
            services in some of the western states, state agencies retain responsibility in many other states. Further&#13;
            changes in responsibilities for expenditure will require significant institutional reform along with transfer of&#13;
            staff from the sectoral line ministries to local authorities. Even in a state such as Kerala, which attempted&#13;
            considerable administrative decentralization, management of urban water supply still remains with a&#13;
            state-level authority. More importantly, as regards WSS, further institutional reforms necessary for community&#13;
            management and the development of autonomous utilities have not been appropriately incorporated in&#13;
2 8         any state so far.&#13;
       s     Revenue assignment. Almost all of the first set of SFCs recommended continuation with the same taxes,&#13;
            and no new taxes were assigned to LAs. The taxation powers of LAs generally include the authority to&#13;
            tax land and buildings; entry of goods into a local area for consumption, use, or sale therein;&#13;
            professions, trades, and employments; and entertainment. Several SFCs made wide-ranging&#13;
            recommendations for improving revenue collection, accounting and financial management of LAs,&#13;
            reform of property tax, better and fuller use of user charges and fees, and greater autonomy for&#13;
            local authorities in setting rates and charges. However, these have not yet been addressed adequately&#13;
            in most states.&#13;
       s Design of transfer system. Recommendations regarding the extent and system of transfer to be made by the&#13;
            SFCs varied between transfers from a general pool, as in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, to transfers linked to&#13;
            specific taxes, as in Kerala. The share of urban LAs in total local transfers has generally been around 15&#13;
            percent. Some states have also introduced performance-linked transfers. In most states, however, the&#13;
            design of transfer systems has been severely constrained by a lack of information.&#13;
       s Subnational borrowing. In the past, most local infrastructure was financed through budgetary&#13;
            allocations, leading to considerable inefficiency and little regard for financial viability. This was aggravated&#13;
            by debt write-off by some of the SFCs, as in one of the northern states. The increasing potential of&#13;
            commercial borrowing in India for urban infrastructure, directly through the market or through&#13;
            commercial financial intermediaries, requires a rule-based state framework that would apply to all municipal&#13;
            authorities that want to borrow on commercial terms to ensure financial viability and minimize&#13;
            the risk of defaults.&#13;
             While suggesting specific fiscal measures to support decentralization, the second set of SFCs will need to&#13;
       address issues of autonomy, equity, predictability, and simplicity, while ensuring local incentives for improved&#13;
       performance. Based on a review of experience so far, special focus is required on improving the resource base&#13;
       of LAs, wider use of user charges, strengthened accounting and auditing systems, improved design of transfer&#13;
       systems, and development of a framework for local borrowing.&#13;

                  District Conditional Grants for Water Supply and Sanitation, Uganda                                         2 9&#13;
&#13;
  The decentralization process in Uganda has been linked to key reforms and changes in institutional arrangements&#13;
  for delivery of services. These give autonomy to local governments to take the lead in the enhancement and&#13;
  development of service delivery in their respective areas. The Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment (MWLE),&#13;
  through the Directorate of Water Development (DWD), has been playing a lead role in supporting implementation&#13;
  of the RWSS program by the local governments.&#13;
        One of the measures in the intergovernmental transfer system in Uganda is the use of conditional grants&#13;
  earmarked for priorities identified at the national level through the poverty reduction strategy process, including&#13;
  education, health, and water supply and sanitation. A district RWSS conditional grant is used to guarantee an&#13;
  overall prioritization of sector investment among districts, as well as among various activities, such as sanitation&#13;
  versus water facilities, hardware versus software, O&amp;M and rehabilitation versus new investments. The grant is&#13;
  co-funded by donors and government and also uses the debt service resources released through the Highly Indebted&#13;
  Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. It is allocated to districts in quarterly transfers based on a formula recognizing the&#13;
  coverage situation specific to the district. The overriding principle of the grant is to provide common implementation&#13;
  strategies, linked to strengthening the demand-responsive approach (DRA) for RWSS, as a part of the priorities&#13;
  identified in the national-level proposals for sector investments. It also helps to encourage good management&#13;
  practices among local authorities.&#13;
        This system of conditional grants has resulted in increased RWSS coverage, improved efficiency of local&#13;
  governments, and wide application of DRA. However, the DWD has been concerned with quality of service&#13;
  delivery and value-for-money actually achieved, and has initiated steps to improve its own and local government&#13;
  capacities to address related issues. Even though the results so far have been satisfactory, it has been noted that&#13;
  coordination and oversight of implementation by the MWLE needs strengthening to improve utilization and&#13;
  outcomes of the conditional grants. At the district and lower levels of local governments, more attention is&#13;
  needed on strengthening overall capacity for planning, implementation, and monitoring.&#13;

                     Local Authority Transfer Fund as Incentive for Local Reforms in Kenya&#13;
&#13;
       The Government of Kenya (GoK) established the local authorities transfer fund to address the fact that the lack&#13;
       of any intergovernmental transfer system hampered local authority ability to deliver local services. The fund is&#13;
       capitalized from a predictable and buoyant pool of resources generated by allocating 5 percent of the annual&#13;
       income tax revenues of the GoK. Transfers are made as discretionary grants, the use of which is decided by local&#13;
       governments through their annual budgets, which combine these resources with other central transfers and the&#13;
3 0    local authoritys own income sources. LATF operational guidelines are very broad, so these remain truly&#13;
       discretionary grants. The transfers are, however, used to provide incentives through a number of related conditions.&#13;
       The amount allocated for each local authority is divided into two basic components: the service delivery&#13;
       component and the performance component. The two separate accounts do not restrict the use of the funds by&#13;
       the local authorities, but merely emphasize the related conditions:&#13;
             Funds from the service delivery account (60 percent) are released on submission of the basic budget&#13;
       document and meeting the related budget conditions for share of expenditure on personnel and development&#13;
       and providing for all new statutory debt. For the fiscal year 2002/03, the conditions included:&#13;
       s The local budget estimates to allocate at least 50 percent of the LATF service delivery amount to capital&#13;
            projects and not more than 60 percent of the total budget to personnel.&#13;
       s LAs are required to pay all statutory charges within the year in which they are due.&#13;
            Funds from the performance account (40 percent) are released based on submission of various financial&#13;
            statements and plans as outlined in the LATF regulations. From fiscal 2002 onwards, LAs have been&#13;
            required to submit the following:&#13;
       s A simple statement of receipts, payments, and balances for the year and an abstract of accounts for the&#13;
            preceding year.&#13;
       s A statement of debtors and creditors for the year, along with a debt repayment plan for the five statutory&#13;
            creditors, signed by all the statutory creditors.&#13;
       s A revenue enhancement plan outlining how the LA would increase its revenue mobilization during each&#13;
            subsequent year.&#13;
       s A local authority service delivery action plan (LASDAP), based on a participatory planning process to&#13;
            identify and prioritize local expenditures to be included in the annual budget process.&#13;
             Achievements arising from LATF incentives include regular information on LA status, preparation of&#13;
       timely budgets and financial statements, improvements in resolution of LA debts, initiating thinking on staff&#13;
       rightsizing and restructuring, and the introduction of participatory budget-linked planning by all LAs.&#13;

                        Local Governance Scorecards for a Graduation Approach in Nigeria&#13;
&#13;
       The local authorities (LAs) in Nigeria constitute the weakest level of government in the federal system and&#13;
       generally need improvement in budget formulation, execution and reporting, participation and planning, project&#13;
       implementation capacity, and personnel administration. The Government of Nigeria is preparing a Community&#13;
       and Local Government Development Project (CLGDP) for possible funding by the World Bank.&#13;
       The CLGDP aims to establish a viable, sustainable, and transparent institutional mechanism for transferring&#13;
       investment resources to local governments and communities to enable them to finance their own development&#13;
       priorities. Through a phased approach, referred to as the graduation process, responsibility for their own&#13;
       investments and for allocating financial resources to communities in their jurisdictions will be transferred to&#13;
       LAs, based on an independent assessment of their capacity. A list of performance indicators has been developed&#13;
       to facilitate the assessment process and to classify the LAs into three broad categories: weak (red light), neutral&#13;
       (amber light), and positive (green light). The weak authorities do not receive any funds directly, and the communities&#13;
       in their jurisdiction are also not considered eligible. Those in the neutral category would be able to advise on the&#13;
       selection of communities in their jurisdiction, but the funds will flow directly to the communities, whereas those&#13;
       in the positive category will receive funds directly and manage its disbursement to communities. The project&#13;
       provides for ways of graduating to a higher category. This approach provides strong incentives even for the weak&#13;
       LAs to improve capacity to access the CLGDP resources and encourages communities to put pressure on their&#13;
       LAs to improve capacity.&#13;

                 Municipal Reforms as a Step Towards Urban Services for the Poor:&#13;
                     Andhra Pradesh Urban Services for the Poor (APUSP) Project&#13;
&#13;
  The Government of Andhra Pradesh in India, with the support of the DFID, has initiated a large urban poverty&#13;
  program to assist poor communities in 32 towns of Andhra Pradesh. The program will benefit an estimated 2.2&#13;
  million slum dwellers. Unlike past poverty alleviation programs that focused exclusively on direct poverty-&#13;
  targeted projects and were more supply-driven, APUSP envisages a process whereby some basic municipal&#13;
  reforms precede access of municipal authorities to investment funding. It also includes a separate component&#13;
  focusing on strengthening the civil society capacity for better articulation of demand. Project governance is&#13;
  largely limited to the government representatives.&#13;
        The central feature of the program is the Municipal Action Plan for Poverty Reduction (MAPP), which adopts&#13;
  a phased approach to planning, reform implementation, and financial assistance for investments. Its features&#13;
  include (a) a participatory planning process involving all stakeholders, particularly the poor (b) an evolving process&#13;
  from a simple Basic MAPP to a Full MAPP as a medium-term plan (c) development of a municipal information&#13;
  system to support the plan process (d) promotion of convergence with other programs and (e) leveraging project&#13;
  resources by mobilizing additional resources for the implementation of the Full MAPP. While all municipalities can&#13;
  receive the assistance for a municipal reform component under their Basic MAPPs, access to investment resources&#13;
  for infrastructure will be contingent on implementing the agreed reforms.&#13;
        Key issues addressed by such a project relate to governance structure, the need for significant support&#13;
  required through state-level legislative and policy actions, and the need for advanced planning required for any&#13;
  additional resource mobilization as envisaged under the Full MAPP.&#13;

                                       Ethiopia Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund&#13;
         The Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund (ESRDF) was established by the Government of&#13;
         Ethiopia in 1996 as a five-year program. The ESRDF finances such small-scale community projects as&#13;
3 6      local-level facilities for education and health, rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS), and small-scale irrigation&#13;
         dams. The ESRDF, like most World Bank-funded social investment funds, operates on the principle of a&#13;
         demand-responsive approach expressed through a community request for a given facility and its willingness to&#13;
         provide contributions to the capital costs.&#13;
               RWSS subprojects funded by the ESRDF provide access to safe water through easy-to-maintain systems&#13;
         by promoting the use of low-cost appropriate technologies. In the selection of technologies, careful attention is&#13;
         given to the capacity of the community to take responsibility for upkeep and repairs. Community user fees are&#13;
         used to maintain facilities and special encouragement is given to the representation of women on community&#13;
         water committees. The subprojects assist not only in raising the health standards of rural communities, but also&#13;
         in reducing womens burden of fetching water. The ESRDF achieved significant RWSS coverage: during its&#13;
         five-year operation, the ESRDF has spent US$33 million (about 30 percent of its total funding in Ethiopia)&#13;
         supporting over 2,300 subprojects and reaching an estimated two million people. Interestingly, the planned&#13;
         RWSS component funding was nearly US$66 million. The slow offtake reflects the considerable mobilization&#13;
         time initially required for RWSS subprojects and the need to build such considerations into similar operations.&#13;
               Some limitations in the ESRDFs RWSS operations include an inadequate emphasis on long-term&#13;
         sustainability. For example, a recent survey shows user charges being collected in only about one-third of the&#13;
         water schemes. However, a positive aspect is the focus on monitoring to assess outcomes. Further strengthening,&#13;
         however, requires greater emphasis on community mobilization at the time of subproject development, better&#13;
         promotion of the concept throughout all regions, and a more carefully planned capacity-building strategy linked&#13;
         with the project cycle.&#13;
               A major contribution of the ESRDF has, however, been its influence on the RWSS policy and strategy in&#13;
         Ethiopia. When it initiated operations, there was no RWSS policy or strategy within the DRA framework and&#13;
         government operations were highly centralized through national level agencies. Through its successful demonstration&#13;
         of a demand-responsive approach to RWSS in Ethiopia, and its effort to coordinate its activities with the&#13;
         relevant sector institutions, the ESRDF has created a wider acceptance of this approach while continually&#13;
         striving to improve and refine it. The WSS policy and strategy developed by the Government of Ethiopia in&#13;
         recent years reflect this new outlook.&#13;

Those particularly relevant to the WSS sector are:                              World Bank evaluations of SIFs suggest that&#13;
s WSS-related sector reforms. WSS sector                                        the sustainability of subprojects in general may&#13;
    practitioners recognize community-driven                                    be an issue requiring greater attention. This&#13;
    development as a key reform, particularly for                               refers to sustaining the benefits over the                            3 7&#13;
    rural areas. For SIF operations, however, two                               intended life of the subproject and beyond.&#13;
    issues are important. First, in those countries                             It requires attention to (a) arrangements for&#13;
    with a lack of such acceptance, the role of the                             ensuring technical quality (b) clarity and&#13;
    SIF would be to promote acceptance,                                         awareness of roles and responsibilities and&#13;
    demonstrating its usefulness and getting the                                (c) ability and willingness to undertake&#13;
    relevant sector institutions to change their                                operation and maintenance obligations&#13;
    mindset and outlook. The SIF in Ethiopia has                                (World Bank 2002h: 24-26). The valuations&#13;
    successfully played this role so that the sector                            also suggest that within SIF operations,&#13;
    strategy has been positively influenced                                     water and sanitation projects tended to&#13;
    (see Box 2.6). Secondly, in contexts where a                                experience the greatest problems in operation&#13;
    demand-responsive strategy already exists,                                  from the outset because of poor or&#13;
    the SIF must align its funding of RWSS                                      inappropriate technical design or lack of local&#13;
    projects with it. For example, rules related to                             organizational or technical capacity (World&#13;
    technology selection, community cost sharing,                               Bank 2002h:28).8 A related issue for WSS&#13;
    and management need to be consistent with                                   subprojects is the appropriate legal&#13;
    the national strategies and other similar                                   arrangement whereby the community&#13;

                               WSS-focused Special Project for Rural Water and Sanitation in India&#13;
&#13;
          An example of a WSS reform-linked special project is used by the Government of India based on lessons&#13;
          learned from a series of community-based rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) projects funded by the&#13;
          World Bank in India within the DRA framework. The Bank followed an approach of developing a generic&#13;
          project concept document to outline the reform approach, on which an assessment of demand from different&#13;
          states was based. These projects have focused on community-based water schemes, integration of hygiene with&#13;
          water, and an emphasis on watershed development to provide source sustainability. Successive projects also&#13;
          aim to gradually integrate RWSS reforms with wider decentralization by putting the rural local government&#13;
          firmly in charge of the development and implementation at the local level. This has been supported with&#13;
          extensive capacity-building support to all stakeholders.&#13;
          The Government of India has also applied this reform agenda to some of its funding to state governments for&#13;
          rural water supply under the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Project (ARWSP) which funds a significant proportion&#13;
          of total rural water supply investments in the country. The attempt has been to scale this up countrywide, with&#13;
          the latest coverage of over 63 districts in 26 states in India. Preliminary results from the first phase suggest that&#13;
          progress is slow and implementation does not always follow the envisaged demand-responsive approach, with&#13;
          the rural local government and communities being in the drivers seat. Significant technical assistance inputs&#13;
          will be required for state governments to balance the reform agenda and meet the project time schedules.&#13;
                  This experience exhibits the need for successful demonstration of reform within the country, considerable&#13;
          technical assistance support for capacity-building built into the reform agenda, and the gradual linkage of the&#13;
          RWSS reform agenda to the wider decentralization reforms.&#13;

     A characteristic of the CDF is the local nature         possibilities for their strategic value in changing&#13;

network of community organizations helps to keep             accountability. CDFs essentially focus on this by&#13;
the costs in check. CDFs often combine grants                building the capacity of poorer groups through&#13;
with loans to support community activities.                  constant pro-poor engagement with local processes&#13;
However, CDFs tend to differ from the                        that more distant agencies are generally not able&#13;

  s Institutional independence through its board and the ability to cover its full operational costs through&#13;
      interest charged on loans.&#13;
  s The use of savings and credit as tools to strengthen communities.&#13;
  s An integrated credit system to respond to communities development needs with varying terms.&#13;
  s Use of communities and networks as principal operating mechanisms.&#13;
  s Innovative and entrepreneurial links to tap a variety of resources for community development needs.&#13;
        By 2000, UCDO had expanded its activities to 53 of the 75 provinces, over 900 community groups had been&#13;
  formed with coverage of over 50 percent of the urban poor communities, 100 community networks had been set up,&#13;
  2.4 million persons had benefited, and cumulative loan disbursement stood at over US$33 million. In 2000, UCDO&#13;
  was merged with the existing Rural Development Fund to form the Community Organization Development Institute&#13;
  (CODI). UCDO-CODI successfully demonstrated an approach to a CDF working through a community-controlled&#13;
  and managed operational framework. One of the main factors in its success has been its institutional independence,&#13;
  which enabled it to benefit from the public institution status while ensuring innovation in its operations. This&#13;
  experience has also been disseminated widely in other countries in East Asia, South Asia, and southern Africa,&#13;
  resulting in the setting up of several community development funds in cities and countries in these regions.&#13;

                   Challenge Funds/Facilities to Support Urban Institutional Reforms&#13;
&#13;
  Challenge funds to support critical institutional reforms are a new genre of fund. Examples from a grant facility&#13;
  in South Africa and the proposed challenge funds in India illustrate their potential.&#13;
        South Africa: local government restructuring grant facility. The transition in South Africa to democratic&#13;
  and non-racial local government has placed both institutional and financial pressures on municipalities.&#13;
  Wide-ranging urban sector reforms are taking place, ranging from redemarcation of municipal boundaries to&#13;
  municipal access to capital markets. In response the local governments need to restructure their institutions and&#13;
  introduce fiscal reforms. These need to be developed with long-term perspectives, but often entail high costs in&#13;
  the short term. It is to assist with these that the Government of South Africa introduced a local government&#13;
  restructuring facility in 2001. This was developed in response to the Johannesburg crisis, and within the context&#13;
  of supporting cities to enhance their contribution to national development. GDP contribution of the 15 largest&#13;
  cities is estimated at more than 55 percent. It provides a multiyear grant of a significant size to provide&#13;
  adequate incentives and to meet the transition costs. It is awarded on a competitive basis through appraisal of&#13;
  locally prepared and owned plans. The early experience, however, suggests that many cities also needed initial&#13;
  support from the national government to prepare their proposals, which has now been introduced. Disbursements&#13;
  are linked to agreed milestones. The facility also provides an opportunity to create a partnership between the&#13;
  treasury and the important city governments.&#13;
  India: Urban Reform Incentive Fund (URIF). Urban development in India has been constrained by a number of&#13;
  institutional and governance issues related to land and delivery of civic services. Under Indias constitution,&#13;
  these reforms fall within the domain of state governments. However, the weaknesses in urban development&#13;
  have national economic implications. With this background the Government of India proposes to establish the&#13;
  Urban Reform Incentive Fund (URIF). URIF's initial allocation of 5 billion rupees (about US$100 million) will&#13;
  provide reform-linked assistance to state governments to facilitate the urban reform process. URIF will seek to&#13;
  provide support for reforms to enable market-based improvements in the delivery of serviced land, housing, and&#13;
  civic services. The reforms would include such areas as land, rent control, development of comprehensive                4 1&#13;
  municipal legislation, restructuring stamp duties, framework for user charges, and enhanced resource mobilization&#13;
  from property taxes and public-private partnerships for civic services.&#13;
        India: City Challenge Fund (CCF). The Government of India also proposes to set up the CCF to provide&#13;
  incentives to cities for institutional restructuring by funding the transitional costs of moving towards sustainable&#13;
  and creditworthy institutional systems of municipal management and service delivery. The CCF will assist cities&#13;
  and towns to undertake the necessary fiscal, financial, and institutional changes required to create efficient and&#13;
  equitable urban centers, and partially finance the cost of developing a comprehensive reform program. Transition&#13;
  costs will cover capacity development, costs of tariff and labor adjustments, and measures to protect the poor.&#13;
  The fund is expected to work on the principle of demand-responsiveness through awards on a competitive basis&#13;
  for the larger towns and cities whose development has an impact on national productivity. For this local&#13;
  ownership of the reform process will be a critical determinant. Budget support will provide assistance against&#13;
  reform milestones as defined by the city governments.&#13;

                Elements of Programmatic Approach: Experience with SWAps and MTEFs in Africa&#13;
&#13;
       Experience with the use of SWAps and MTEFs is very recent and of a short duration. However, these evolved in&#13;
       response to the shift in policy dialogues from structural adjustment to public expenditure management and the&#13;
       need to reform aid. Opportunities also emerged in response to the sector reform programs in several sectors. Both,&#13;
       when used jointly, help to establish a greater coherence between policies, programs, and budgets.&#13;
             Sector-wide approach (SWAp). No comprehensive review of SWAps is available. However, some experience&#13;
       in the health sector reported by Merrick (n.d.) suggests that most SWAps only capture public expenditures,&#13;
       approximately 50 percent of total sector expenditure. Also, there is probably inadequate ownership and participation&#13;
       of the wider stakeholder group and issues related to suitability in decentralized systems, along with concerns related&#13;
       to the weak accountability systems and inadequate government capacity to deal with NGOs and the private&#13;
       sector. Many of the donors also have difficulties with the loss of attribution that results from the pooled funding&#13;
       arrangements or budget support that is linked to this approach. On the other hand, SWAps can help put the&#13;
       governments squarely in charge and result in a more equitable application of interventions. A number of system&#13;
       improvements and accountability improvements are achieved throughout the sector rather than for selected projects.&#13;
       SWAps have been linked to a variety of financing arrangements: (a) pooled or basket funding through budget&#13;
       support (b) pooled with earmarking and (c) parallel funding for activities in the program. In some cases, as for the&#13;
       health sector SWAp in Ethiopia, a mix of different mechanisms is used with three or four different channels. Pooled&#13;
       funding through budget support is being used for the WSS sector in South Africa and is being explored in Uganda.&#13;
             Medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). South Africa and Uganda initiated MTEFs about a decade&#13;
       ago. However, they have recently received renewed attention in the context of formulation of poverty reduction&#13;
       strategy papers (PRSPs). In most cases in Africa, the World Bank was involved with the decision to adopt and&#13;
       implement this framework. This has usually resulted from the findings of a public expenditure review (PER).&#13;
       Poverty reduction support credit (PRSC), the new programmatic instrument to support implementation of&#13;
       PRSPs, will be based on the medium-term programs and costing in the countrys PRSP and hence its MTEF.&#13;
4 4    A recent review by Hourerou and Taliercio (2002) provides a comparative assessment of the design and impact&#13;
       of MTEFs on public finance and economic management in nine African countries. This assessment suggests&#13;
       that to be effective, MTEFs need to be preceded by comprehensive and detailed diagnoses of budget management&#13;
       systems and processes. Improved budget execution and reporting need particular attention. Appropriate sequencing&#13;
       of overall public expenditure management reforms is necessary, and the MTEF needs integration with the&#13;
       budget process from the outset. Importantly, success of the MTEF in some African countries, such as South&#13;
       Africa and Uganda, is critically linked to appropriate political motivations and incentives for its use.&#13;

approach aims to support reforms by: (a)                   than for more complex sectors such as&#13;

       WSS services to 85 percent of the rural population by 2009. The program was initiated in 1999 with the Bank&#13;
       disbursing the first of three phases of disbursements. Each subsequent phase is supposed to build on the lessons&#13;
       learned from the previous phase, with the ultimate aim of scaling up reforms from pilot projects in four regions to&#13;
       eventually the whole country by the end of the last phase. Below are the goals for each phase of the program,&#13;
       reproduced from the project appraisal document:&#13;

&#13;
            The program is halfway through the first phase of the APL, which has focused both on implementing&#13;
       demand-responsive and sustainable water and sanitation services, and on strengthening the capacity of the&#13;
       private sector and NGOs to provide hardware and software services. The main challenge so far has been to&#13;
       transfer contracting functions from the centrally managed CWSA to the local district authorities. To provide&#13;
       incentives for this, the APL has funds at hand to remunerate the CWSA for implementation of the project&#13;
       components described above. There is also a fee for service paid to the CWSA for facilitating project&#13;
       implementation and for providing technical assistance to the districts.&#13;

                                       Poverty Reduction Support Credit in Uganda&#13;
&#13;
   In 2001 and 2002, the World Bank disbursed the two tranches of the PRSC to Uganda (Brown 2002). Each&#13;
   tranche was valued at $150 million, with a subsequent tranche of similar size planned for the third year, subject&#13;
   to continued performance on the credit. The PRSC is designed to help the government implement its PRSP. The&#13;
   Government of Uganda had already developed its own Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), which&#13;
   demonstrated its commitment to reform.&#13;
          By working through the government system, the programmatic approach enabled by the PRSC promotes&#13;
   Ugandan ownership. Having the government in the drivers seat means more predictable funding, strengthened&#13;
   budgetary institutions, and reduced transaction costs in the delivery of external assistance. Since the PRSC is&#13;
   innovative in changing the lending philosophy, this has meant that establishing coordination and consensus&#13;
   among donors and government has been one of the main challenges. Nevertheless, strong leadership both on&#13;
   the part of the government and from the Bank task manager has contributed to the success of reforms. The&#13;
   second PRSP tranche was approved in June 2002 with all policy benchmarks being met and a 90 percent&#13;
   utilization rate of budgeted resources. This client-driven approach to setting targets is more effective than the&#13;
   traditional conditionality tied to loan agreements.&#13;
          The water sector has benefited from the comprehensive, system-wide approach of service delivery. Rural,&#13;
   small town, and urban WSS have all seen improved coverage, and private sector management contracts have&#13;
   increased, in accordance with targets. Key lessons from this experience focus on strong leadership from both&#13;
   government and Bank managers, thorough sector work and background work, and the need for parallel TA&#13;
   projects to deal with complex issues and improve the quality of service delivery. Though very recent and&#13;
   ongoing, lessons from this experience will provide directions for future use of programmatic approaches in the&#13;
   WSS sector. In this context greater emphasis is necessary on strengthening sector-level monitoring and evaluation&#13;
   systems to enhance program effectiveness and analyze lessons learned. Recent results from ongoing monitoring&#13;
   studies do highlight problems with appropriate measurement of performance and emphasize the need for a&#13;
   greater focus on strengthening sector performance monitoring.&#13;

                         Millennium Development Goals: Costs and Potential Finance Gaps&#13;
    Millennium Development Goals and Targets&#13;
    s Water and sanitation are embedded in Goal 7 of the MDGs, which aims to ensure environmental&#13;
          sustainability. There are two targets that are particularly relevant: Target 10: Halve by 2015 the proportion&#13;
          of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and hygienic sanitation. Indicator: proportion&#13;
          of the population with sustainable access to an improved water source. Target 11: By 2020 to have&#13;
          achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers. Indicator: proportion&#13;
          of people with access to improved sanitation.&#13;
    s Water supply and sanitation also contribute to Goals 1 (poverty), 3 (gender equality), 4 (child mortality),&#13;
          and 6 (HIV/AIDS and other diseases).&#13;
    Costs of meeting the MDGs and potential financing gaps&#13;
    s Various estimates of costs of meeting the WSS MDGs have been made ranging from US$25 to 100 billion&#13;
          a year, mainly depending on inclusion or otherwise of municipal sewerage.&#13;
    s Estimates of current investments in water and sanitation in developing countries are about $15 billion a&#13;
          year. Of this, it is estimated that about 75 percent is financed by governments, 11 percent by the private&#13;
          sector, and 14 percent by external support agencies.&#13;
    s Thus, even for the lowest requirement scenario, the financing gap for WSS MDGs is about $10 billion a&#13;
          year, representing a 70 percent increase in annual investments.&#13;

       leveraging. The financing mechanisms to leverage      resources to WSS by promoting their more efficient&#13;

         In the late 1980s Guinea had one of Africas least-developed urban water systems. Less than 40 percent of the&#13;
         population had piped water connections, and those that had connections faced intermittent water supply and&#13;
         poor water quality. The Government of Guinea decided to improve this situation in 1989 by granting a lease&#13;
         arrangement for PSP operation of urban water services.&#13;
               At this time, tariffs were set far below cost-recovery levels, with households paying US$0.12 per cubic meter&#13;
         (1989 US dollars), compared to an estimated rate of US$0.68 for cost recovery. In order to have sustainable and&#13;
         financially viable water services and to give operators the incentive to expand coverage, the government committed&#13;
         to raising tariffs to cost-recovery levels. However, the government wanted to increase tariffs gradually to avoid&#13;
         major tariff shock at the beginning of the contract and to give time for water services to improve before consumers&#13;
         saw a hike in their bills.&#13;
               To ease the transition to cost-recovery tariffs, in the first six years of the contract the government made use&#13;
         of International Development Association (IDA) credit to subsidize a declining share of the operators verified&#13;
         supply costs, while tariffs gradually increased to cover costs. However, after the subsidy phased out, tariffs continued&#13;
         to increase to US$0.83 in 1996, remaining constant in local currency for the remainder of the lease contract. This&#13;
         resulted in a steep fall in connections and a corresponding rise in inactive connections. The contract was not&#13;
         renewed when it expired in 1999, and the international partners subsequently left the country in 2001.&#13;
               The contract resulted in considerable improvements, with access to piped water increasing from 39 percent&#13;
         in 1989 to 47 percent in 1996 and with piped water in the capital city complying with World Health Organization&#13;
         norms by 1994. However, regulatory capacity to balance consumer and PSP interests was weak, as evidenced&#13;
         by the fact that the government was unable to renegotiate a reduction in the tariff level. What can be learned&#13;
         from Guinea is that output-based subsidies can help to ease the transition to full cost-recovery tariffs. However,&#13;
         in order for the scheme to be sustainable and efficient, it must be accompanied by a credible regulatory&#13;
         framework and provide incentives for the private operator to cut costs, while passing the savings to consumers.&#13;

       the concession, so that private operators can                     balancing laws and contracts to avoid overlap,&#13;
       provide water services at a lower than existing rate,             giving credibility to the regulatory framework.&#13;

               Senegal Water Sector Reform: Innovative Contracts and Sound Relationships&#13;
&#13;
   Recent reforms in the Senegal water sector have involved an innovative response to the conditions commonly&#13;
   found in many developing countries: a bankrupt public utility, decline in status of water services, including for                5 7&#13;
   the poor, and failure of most government attempts to introduce performance improvements. The focus&#13;
   in Senegal reforms has been on developing an appropriate contractual arrangement linked to&#13;
   improvements in financial health of the utility. This was accomplished through the use of a detailed financial&#13;
   model to ensure that initial donor support results in sustainable internal cash generation for long-term financial&#13;
   viability of the asset-holding company. The Senegal reform has also included a focus on ensuring access for the&#13;
   poor through access subsidies.&#13;
           The main institutional change focused on transferring the assets to a government-owned asset-holding company,&#13;
   which, along with the relevant ministry, was a signatory to an operating contract with a private operator. The enhanced&#13;
   affermage contract used for this provided incentives to the private contractor for improved performance through two&#13;
   parameters: improved technical efficiency in operations and collection of bills. The financial model developed for this&#13;
   purpose also helped to track progress towards financial equilibrium, and the tariff increases were carefully calculated each&#13;
   year to ensure that the utility moved towards this goal. Local ownership and understanding of this approach was built&#13;
   through a series of workshops and capacity-building measures, as well as active participation of stakeholders in developing&#13;
   the framework through a local steering committee. This was supported through a transparent and extensive competitive&#13;
   bidding process with full government ownership. The reform, including an operating subsidy for the utility in the early years&#13;
   while tariffs gradually rose to cost-recovery levels, has been financed mainly by the World Bank and other donors,&#13;
   though about 10 percent of total funds have been mobilized through commercial bank loans. A part of the Bank&#13;
   and donor funds was provided as equity. In general, the outcome of this reform has been more water to more&#13;
   people, increased numbers of poor people connected to the utility, and improved financial health of the asset-&#13;
   holding company. An environment of trust and mutual respect has developed between the asset-holding company&#13;
   and the private operator, which has resulted in successful review of contract stipulations.&#13;
           The reform implementation in Senegal is generally perceived as an example of well-planned and executed&#13;
   reform and has stood the test of time. Key aspects have been an overall climate for reform in the country,&#13;
   government commitment and ownership of reform, and the continued support of the World Bank and other&#13;
   donors to the process. It had wide-reaching effects, not only in Senegal, but also in many other countries in&#13;
   the African region. For example, subsequent reform in Niger and Tanzania has drawn on this experience.&#13;

                   Teshi Tankers in Ghana: An Enabling Framework for Small-scale Independent Providers&#13;
&#13;
         Following the construction boom in Accra in the late 1980s, the demand for tanker water services increased.&#13;
         Initially illegal tapping of water from fire hydrants flourished, coupled with a lack of quality and price control.&#13;
         However, Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) responded to this by becoming involved in negotiations&#13;
         with the tanker owners. Over time, three separate tanker associations have been established and a growing&#13;
         number of tankers has since formally entered the water supply market.&#13;
                GWCL entered into contracts with these associations and established special service points at various locations.&#13;
         As a result of the contracts, associations now offer improved conditions for service, including regularization of&#13;
         previously illegal operations, access to a reliable water supply, and a favorable bulk rate for water purchased&#13;
         through the tanker association service stations. At the same time, the contracts also place&#13;
         responsibilities on the associations. For example, the water tankers may no longer transport fuel, the associations&#13;
         regularly inspect the trucks for cleanliness and are responsible for collecting charges from the tankers and making&#13;
         regular monthly payments of bills to GWCL. Any failure to comply with these conditions leads to a cancellation of&#13;
         the entire contract, which acts as a self-regulating mechanism. Greater transparency in prices has also resulted. The&#13;
         presence of three associations also gives tanker owners a choice and GWCL the advantages of benchmarking and&#13;
         cartel avoidance.&#13;
                While in the long run the role of water tankers may be affected by the proposed privatization of GWCL,&#13;
         this enabling framework and public-private partnership has resulted in a number of benefits: better information&#13;
         for low-income consumers and vendors, improved revenues for GWCL, more reliable access to water for the&#13;
         tankers, and improved water quality. Consumer confidence increased. For the tanker owners, a greater recognition&#13;
         and legal basis has reduced risks, allowing for increased investment and better and more affordable services to&#13;
         consumers. Negotiations with GWCL are possible regarding more service points and appropriate bulk prices.&#13;

                          MIGA Guarantee for Water Concession in Guayaquil, Ecuador&#13;
&#13;
       In 2001, MIGA signed its first water project guarantee in Guayaquil, Ecuador, offering a US$18 million guarantee for&#13;
       investments by International Water Services B.V. of the Netherlands in an Ecuadorian subsidiary. The guarantee&#13;
       supports a new concession agreement that privatized municipal water services in Guayaquil.&#13;
       The concession includes progressive qualitative standard measurements, and noncompliance triggers a performance&#13;
       bond at any time during the 30-year concession. The performance bond, posted by the company in accordance with&#13;
       the concession, guarantees the companys successful management, expansion, and operation of the water services.&#13;
              Guayaquil is the countrys financial and industrial hub, with about two million inhabitants. During a 20-year&#13;
       period its population doubled, putting strain on existing infrastructure and basic service providers. Poor areas have&#13;
       little access to basic services. At the time of privatization, the water utility collected about 50 percent of revenues,&#13;
       and one-third of consumers did not receive adequate services. The new company is working to upgrade services and&#13;
       improve performance. The concession calls for an improvement in quality of service as well as coverage.&#13;
              The guarantee has two components: (a) providing protection against the risks of expropriation, war, and&#13;
       civil disturbance and (b) covering breach of contract, denial of justice, and wrongful call of the performance&#13;
       bond, as well as the equity investment, in case that the company successfully manages, expands, and operates&#13;
       water services. The guarantee arrangement provides that the amount of compensation will not exceed the&#13;
       amount of the performance bond.&#13;
              Currently, the Guayaquil guarantee is the only MIGA WSS contract outstanding, as promoters in this&#13;
       sector have started using MIGA products only recently. However, in line with the Millennium Development&#13;
       Goals, MIGA has targeted the WSS sector as a priority, and it is working with other parts of the Bank to put&#13;
       together packages that would be attractive for this sector.&#13;

&#13;
                         Using Partial Guarantees for Municipal Infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
Decentralization of municipal infrastructure services in many Central and Eastern European countries left the&#13;
majority of municipalities with substantial financing difficulties, due to their lack of existing resources and their&#13;
inability to attract private capital on their own creditworthiness. World Bank partial credit or partial risk guarantees&#13;
are being considered to mobilize private capital to those municipal projects that otherwise would only have been&#13;
financed through conventional fiscal or on-lending arrangements. If successful, this would be the first case of&#13;
using World Bank guarantees at the subnational level.&#13;
     The guarantee scheme relies on having a subnational financing intermediary (SFI) to serve as a vehicle for&#13;
channeling financing from public, as well as private, sources. The SFI can be established as a multifunctional&#13;
vehicle capable of utilizing both PCG and PRG instruments for mobilizing resources, as described in the&#13;
diagram below.&#13;

     In discussions with local commercial banks and consulting firms in Budapest, the importance of the capacity&#13;
and neutrality of the second tier SFIs was repeatedly emphasized. Another challenge in setting up the guarantee&#13;
scheme is to obtain the sovereign counter-guarantee, critical for the World Banks involvement. This requires a pre-&#13;
agreed contract between the municipal and national governments to provide a disincentive for the municipal&#13;
government to default on its loan agreements, for example, through an intercept (clawback) of transfers arrangement.&#13;
Setting up a guarantee scheme for subnational borrowing remains difficult because compared to traditional&#13;
on-lending, due diligence and market checks need to be performed for private sector investment, thereby making&#13;
upfront costs per loan relatively high. However, this may potentially have a substantial impact on reform by&#13;
promoting a shift to greater credibility and PSP involvement. The guarantee scheme for increased PSP in municipal&#13;
infrastructure is currently under discussion with the municipal and national governments, and they are in the&#13;
process of selecting pilot projects.&#13;

 of this effort, its Department of Constitutional Development has taken on a number of activities to support the&#13;
 development of municipal infrastructure. The Municipal Infrastructure Investment Unit (MIIU) was set up in&#13;
 1998 to facilitate this process, with a focus on private sector participation. It is intended as a five-year intervention&#13;
 to develop the market for technical assistance in this area, as evidenced from its mission statement:                           6 3&#13;
&#13;
 s    To encourage and optimize private sector investment in core local authority services, on a basis that is&#13;
       sustainable for both local authorities and at a national level and&#13;
 s    To assist the development of an established market containing informed local authority clients, private&#13;
      sector advisers, and private sector investors and service providers, so that MIIU can be wound up no later&#13;
      than five years after the date of its establishment.&#13;
       MIIU is established as a Section 21 company to manage the process of developing projects in a professional&#13;
 manner and free from political intervention. MIIU structure has three interlocking components, namely:&#13;
 s A Board of Directors with a broad oversight and policy role, and a specific fiduciary duty with respect to the grant fund.&#13;
 s    A Grant Fund, seed-funded by the Government of South Africa, to provide direct assistance to&#13;
      municipalities for the preparation of projects involving private sector funding and&#13;
 s    A Project Preparation Unit, which is the operational core of the MIIU and which processes applications&#13;
      and manages the fund.&#13;
       MIIU has successfully leveraged the limited government funding of about 20 million rand to support the&#13;
 completion of 14 projects with a total contract value of 5.6 billion rand in municipal services such as water and&#13;
 sanitation, waste management, municipal transport, municipal power, and information technology. MIIU&#13;
 currently has 33 projects in the pipeline, consisting of 12 in water supply and sanitation, 7 in solid waste, 5 in&#13;
 transportation, 3 in power, 2 in information technology, and 4 other projects. In WSS, the Nelspruit and the&#13;
 Dolphin Coast projects were among the first long-term concession contracts in the country.&#13;
       MIIU has helped to create greater awareness and provided support for the projects with private sector&#13;
 participation. Its completed projects provide benchmarks and documentation for future project development.&#13;
 In addition, it has also provided support to the national reforms of municipal services and of the regulatory&#13;
 framework for water-related contracts. It is, however, not clear whether MIIU has helped to develop a market&#13;
 for these services so that its support would not be necessary after a five-year period. Also, given its limited&#13;
 mandate, MIIU has not provided support to municipalities for public sector reform, often required as precursors&#13;
 to private sector participation.&#13;

       throughout the development and implementation              independently, either through board-managed&#13;

            Project Support Facilities for Infrastructure Investments: Indian Experiences&#13;
&#13;
 Many state governments and private sector enterprises in India have recognized the importance of project&#13;
 development for attracting private investments in infrastructure. Over a dozen different initiatives have emerged&#13;
 in the last few years. There are several different types of initiatives:&#13;
 s Pure project support facilities, such as the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board, or those in&#13;
     Andhra Pradesh (APIIF), Uttar Pradesh (UPIIF), Punjab (PIIF), Kerala (I-KIN), West Bengal (I-WIN), and&#13;
     Rajasthan (PDCOR).&#13;
 s Integrated agencies providing project development and financing support, such as in Tamil Nadu (TNUDF),&#13;
     Karnataka (I-DECK), Gujarat (GIIF), and Maharashtra (MUIF).&#13;
 s Project development partnership agreements, such as those signed by the state governments of Andhra&#13;
     Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Goa with the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&amp;FS) for&#13;
     development of infrastructure projects with private sector participation.&#13;
 s Memoranda of Understanding (MoU), as signed by the state governments of Tamil Nadu and Uttaranchal&#13;
     with the Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) for development of policy frameworks and&#13;
     project structuring in various infrastructure sectors.&#13;
 s Dedicated private sector project development and equity fund for urban infrastructure to invest in private&#13;
     sector projects, as set up by Feedback Ventures.&#13;
 s Several donors and programs including USAID, WSP, and AusAID also provide support to project develop&#13;
     ment for projects with private sector participation, and public sector projects with commercial orientation.&#13;
     The IDFC has set up a special unit, referred to as Decentralized Infrastructure and New Technologies&#13;
 (DINT), to focus its efforts on ensuring the last mile access in infrastructure. Such decentralized projects could&#13;
 provide access while stimulating local entrepreneurship and economic development. The DINT unit within&#13;
 IDFC has the corporate mandate to explore opportunities for development of such projects and pursue their&#13;
 appraisal for possible funding. This will be done for all the infrastructure sectors that IDFC finances, including&#13;
 power, telecom, roads and transport, and water and urban development.                                                   6 5&#13;
      These facilities and arrangements have emerged in response to an understanding that development of&#13;
 bankable investment opportunities requires assistance for technical studies and process management, as well&#13;
 as constant advocacy for tariff and regulatory reforms. Most facilities focus on a variety of infrastructure sectors&#13;
 and increasingly focus towards smaller projects. Most facilities concentrate on developing private sector projects.&#13;
 Only two of the above, TNUDF and the proposed MUIF, also include improvements to projects implemented by&#13;
 the public sector through greater commercial orientation.&#13;
      Though it is early to assess their performance, many of the above arrangements fall far short of their initial&#13;
 targets. Preliminary review suggests that the poor performance reflects an inadequate emphasis on early capacity-&#13;
 building and wider institutional and policy reforms. It is also a result of wavering political commitment to private&#13;
 sector participation and a lack of incentives for reforms at state and local levels. The recent trend indicates,&#13;
 therefore, simultaneously focusing on reforms and moving towards more flexible partnership and MoU arrangements.&#13;
 Further inquiries and a detailed assessment are needed to review their relative performance and assess the factors&#13;
 that contribute to success or otherwise.&#13;

   In the WSS sector, there will often be a need                  systems that have deteriorated due to neglect&#13;
   for exploring more decentralized options                       of public delivery systems. Most project&#13;
   that are smaller with either community                         support facilities discussed above have tended&#13;
   management or small private service                            to ignore such smaller decentralized and&#13;
   providers. Such options are likely to be more                  community-level options. As an exception to&#13;

               Box 3.9&#13;
&#13;
                          Evolution of Indias Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund&#13;
&#13;
  In 1988 the Municipal Urban Development Fund (MUDF) was created as a revolving fund to finance municipal&#13;
  infrastructure projects as part of Indias IDA-supported Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project (TNUDP). From&#13;
  1988 to 1996, the MUDF effectively disbursed about US$63 million to over 500 infrastructure projects in 90 out&#13;
  of 110 municipalities in the state of Tamil Nadu, with repayment rates of close to 80 percent. Despite the successes&#13;
  of the MUDF, it depended entirely on public financing, which rendered its lending capacity too small to meet&#13;
  potential demand. Also, the MUDF was located within the administrative structure of the government, making it&#13;
  susceptible to the risk of political interference.&#13;
        As a result, in 1996 the MUDF was restructured into an autonomous financial intermediary, the Tamil&#13;
  Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF), with the goal of providing self-sustainable financing for infrastructure&#13;
  investment. The Government of Tamil Nadu holds 72 percent of the capital, while the remaining 28 percent is&#13;
  held by three private financial institutions with a strong reputation in Indias business and financial community.&#13;
  These three financial institutions also hold the majority stake in the asset management company of the TNUDF.&#13;
  This has helped to ensure private management of the TNUDF and a great degree of independence from any&#13;
  political interference in operational decisions. Since its creation in 1996, the TNUDF has gradually adjusted loan&#13;
  interest rates to market-determined rates. By 2000/01, its loan recovery rate had increased to 99 percent, and its&#13;
  annual disbursement had increased to six times the amount in 1997/98. TNUDF does benefit from the use of&#13;
  intercept as a security and credit enhancement. To its credit, however, it has strived to make these concepts&#13;
  available to other lenders to the municipal authorities. It has also assisted the municipalities to structure projects&#13;
  in a public-private format and raise private resources.&#13;
        Under the restructuring, the TNUDP II Loan Covenant required the TNUDF to raise US$50 million from the&#13;
  private sources, from bond and co-financing with financial institutions. In November 2000, the TNUDF successfully&#13;
  issued a US$23 million bond with a five-year maturity. The TNUDF has assisted some of the larger municipalities&#13;
  in issuing direct bonds, and is currently assisting smaller municipalities to pool financing with a credit-enhancing&#13;
  scheme with support from the Government of Tamil Nadu and USAID under its Development Credit Authority&#13;
  (DCA). The TNUDF demonstrates that it is possible to convert an MDF into a market-oriented fund when there are                        6 9&#13;
  clear mandates for private sector integration.&#13;

                       Subnational Financial Intermediation through FINDETER in Colombia&#13;
&#13;
         Colombias FINDETER is a case of an internationally supported municipal development fund that has successfully&#13;
         helped to develop sustainable local credit markets. FINDETER was originally an infrastructure-financing window&#13;
         within the National Mortgage Bank, but in 1989 it was spun off as an independent subnational financial&#13;
         intermediary. The goal of FINDETER is to supply credit to municipalities through commercial banks, ultimately&#13;
         building their capacity for municipal lending.&#13;
               FINDETER operates as a second-tier refinancing facility. It works with local governments to evaluate&#13;
         investment projects from a technical and financial standpoint. Once a project is approved, FINDETER helps the&#13;
         municipality to find a commercial bank willing to finance the project. FINDETER agrees to refinance up to 85&#13;
         percent of the commercial banks loan, but the commercial bank assumes credit risk for the entire loan and&#13;
         must perform its own credit analysis.&#13;
                FINDETER has had a great track record compared to other MDFs, with less than 2 percent of commercial&#13;
         loans classified as non-performing. Reasons for its strong performance include (a) a voluntary intercept provision&#13;
         that strengthens loan security by diverting intergovernmental transfers or other local revenue streams to commercial&#13;
         banks in the case of default and (b) its second-tier structure means that lending is not influenced by political&#13;
         pressure because commercial banks take on all the credit risk.&#13;
               Since the beginning of the 1990s, FINDETER has had a shrinking share of the market, with local governments&#13;
         increasingly accessing commercial banks directly. Also, the largest cities have recently used their creditworthiness&#13;
         developed under FINDETER loans to begin financing their projects directly through the bond market. While this&#13;
         has been a concern for the institution, it is a good sign that municipal lending is fully integrating into the&#13;
         commercial credit market.&#13;

                                        Experience with Municipal Bond Issuance in India&#13;
&#13;
   Urban infrastructure investments in India have traditionally been financed through budgetary allocation and&#13;
   borrowings from higher levels of government or through government-owned financial intermediaries generally&#13;
   guaranteed by state governments. On the other hand, for its level of economic development India enjoys a&#13;
   relatively well-developed financial sector and capital markets. In response to this, direct market access emerged&#13;
   in 1997 as a potential new source of finance with the private and public issuance of municipal bonds by the&#13;
   Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, with credit enhancement structures that did not rely on state government&#13;
   guarantees. Since then, six other municipal authorities have raised resources through municipal bonds without&#13;
   state guarantee. While the total volume of municipal debt remains a fraction of the Indian debt market, it does&#13;
   represent a new potential. The Rakesh Mohan Committee on Commercialization of Infrastructure endorsed the&#13;
   concept of municipal bonds, and the Government of India (GoI) provided income tax exemption for these&#13;
   bonds. With the development of the Indian debt market through the opening of the insurance and pension fund&#13;
   sectors, and better development of the market infrastructure, municipal bonds will develop as a potentially&#13;
   robust source if some of the issues discussed below are addressed:&#13;
   s Municipal bonds in India have been structured obligations with credit enhancement essentially through&#13;
          escrow of dedicated revenue streams. Unfortunately, despite the early discussion on revenue bonds, all the&#13;
          bonds so far have used only general municipal revenues rather than other sources such as fees and user&#13;
          charges. Also, the limited market-based opportunities in the Indian market for credit enhancement43 have                                                  7 1&#13;
          limited the growth of this market to some extent.&#13;
   s The credit rating by domestic rating agencies for these bond issues has proven an encouraging trend. CRISIL,&#13;
          the premier domestic credit-rating agency, took the lead in developing the methodology for rating these issues&#13;
          with support from the Indo-USAID FIRE Project. External review and monitoring by credit-rating agencies&#13;
          provides for the first time an independent review by private sector entities. It provides an assessment and periodic&#13;
          evaluation of credit quality and has created greater accountability for municipal leadership.&#13;
   s The credit-rating agencies and investment bankers have played a role in creating market awareness and&#13;
          opportunities based on incentives for fee-based services. A large number of municipal authorities had their&#13;
          potential instruments rated. These efforts have also helped to create a greater awareness about better&#13;
          accounting and financial management systems.&#13;
   s A major limitation in the evolving municipal bond system has been the limited number of municipal&#13;
          authorities with adequate credit quality to use this potential source for financing their infrastructure&#13;
          investments. Other reforms related to resource mobilization, expenditure management, and improved&#13;
          accountability systems, as currently pursued under the World Bank project in Tamil Nadu and through the&#13;
          FIRE Project, deserve greater emphasis. The Government of India also plans to pursue this through the&#13;
          recent proposal for the Urban Reform Initiative Fund (see Box 2.9). The GoI needs to also explore the&#13;
          possibility of linking the tax exemption incentive to such reforms.&#13;
   s A limitation in municipal capacity has been weak project development and implementation capacity,&#13;
          which has hampered the timely and effective use of the resources mobilized through bond issuance. This&#13;
          needs to be addressed by appropriate project development support as discussed above, but equally by&#13;
          improved governance at the local level through better procurement and accountability processes.&#13;
   s A more appropriate development of this source would also require addressing policy issues related to a&#13;
          conducive regulatory framework for municipal borrowing, string disclosure and rating requirements,&#13;
          appropriate bankruptcy legislation, and adoption of arbitrage regulation with the use of GoIs tax exemption&#13;
          provisions. This would need support by independent and regularly updated information about the municipal&#13;
          performance, as has been initiated by CRISIL through its benchmarking of municipalities.&#13;

                            US Bond Banks for Pooled Financing for Small Municipalities&#13;
&#13;
         The municipal bond market in the United States dates back to the 19th century, but bond banks started&#13;
         appearing only 30 years ago with the creation of the Vermont Municipal Bond Bank in 1969, generally credited&#13;
         as the countrys first general purpose bond bank. A broad definition of a bond bank is an entity that sells its own&#13;
         securities and relends bond proceeds to local governments, enabling them to pool their borrowing requirements.&#13;
         The in-built diversification of the pool means that bonds can be issued at lower interest rates than if they were&#13;
         issued for a single locality. Pooling also enables local governments to benefit from economies of scale by&#13;
         spreading the fixed costs of issuance.&#13;
               Several features help the bond banks to limit credit risks. First, a sophisticated credit-rating system exists in&#13;
         the United States that reliably distinguishes risk. Second, most bond banks use some form of credit enhancement,&#13;
         possibly in the form of moral obligation pledges, state aid intercepts, general obligation pledges, or annual&#13;
         appropriation pledges. Thirdly, the United States has a competitive bond insurance market, which provides&#13;
         affordable insurance to support bond issues that may have lower underlying credit ratings.&#13;
               Municipal bond banks have played a key role in enabling smaller local government entities to have access to the&#13;
         debt market. More recently, bond banks have taken on specialized areas of activity, including schools and environmental&#13;
         improvements. In some states specialized bond banks have developed for water and sewerage backed by partial&#13;
         grant funding, which enables them to offer lower rates through blending or credit enhancement.&#13;

            Sector Framework to Leverage Community Resources for Rural Water Supply: China&#13;
&#13;
        Compared to the widely prevalent low cost recovery for rural and small town water supply, and despite its being&#13;
        away from the fanfare of international declarations related to cost recovery, the Chinese experience suggests&#13;
        that with an appropriate sector framework, it is possible to achieve high levels of cost recovery while maintaining&#13;
        prices at affordable levels for the population. The first World Bank-financed rural water supply project in 1985&#13;
        initiated this, and it has been refined further over three subsequent projects. These projects serve nearly&#13;
        23 million people in 18 provinces in rural China. Compared to the global norm of about 10 percent cost&#13;
        recovery, users of the piped rural water supply schemes in China pay about 75 percent of the capital investment&#13;
        and the full operation and maintenance cost. The capital cost is recovered through upfront cost sharing by the&#13;
        county government and community (25 percent each) and an IDA loan (50 percent), in turn repaid through user&#13;
        charges. User charges cover the debt servicing and full operation and maintenance expenses.&#13;
             This approach has been possible due to a number of factors in a supportive sector framework, including:&#13;
        s Financially viable utility framework. At the level of small town, many of the township water supply plants are&#13;
             registered as enterprisesunder the Enterprise Law. Each plant is headed by a full-time plant manager with other&#13;
             staff members for assistance. The enterprise at the town level pays tax to the government and prepares annual&#13;
             reports and balance sheets as a company. The plant works as an independent and financially viable utility with&#13;
             responsibility for ensuring adequate services and meeting its own costs as well as debt servicing of the loans. Bill&#13;
             collectors in each village collect water fees from households. The utility structure provides a strong incentive for the&#13;
             plant management to be efficient, as their salaries are linked to the plants financial viability.&#13;
        s Tariff-setting. User charges are levied by the utility to meet its costs, with tariffs determined to cover the&#13;
             costs of electricity, salaries, water source fee, depreciation, debt servicing, other overheads, and tax. It&#13;
             is estimated that the monthly bills are about 3.5 percent of household income, despite the fact that the&#13;
             Bank projects used poverty as a major criterion to choose provinces. However, in remote and less densely&#13;
             populated areas, smaller systems (such as handpumps, rainwater collection systems, and small tube wells)&#13;
             are used, which do not have the debt servicing of loans included in user charges.&#13;
7 4     s Regulatory framework for tariffs. The regulation of tariffs set by the plant is done through the County Price&#13;
             Bureau (CPB). After deciding on a change required in tariffs, the utility sends it for approval to the CPB&#13;
             through the county project office. The CPB assesses the justification for tariff increases and consults with&#13;
             both the plant management and the concerned villages through public meetings. If satisfied, the CPB&#13;
             recommends it for approval to the countys standing committee to make the final decision. This process&#13;
             generally takes about three months. In some cases, the CPB may ask the utility to revise the proposed tariff.&#13;
        s Uniform cost-recovery policy across programs. In China, unlike in many other developing countries, there is&#13;
             little difference between the cost-recovery policy of the Bank-assisted projects and that of the regular&#13;
             government-funded rural water supply programs. However, the government funds are used mainly for small&#13;
             schemes where the cost-recovery policy essentially comprises full labor contribution (typically 30 percent of&#13;
             the development cost) and full responsibility for O&amp;M cost. The Bank program for schemes in remote areas&#13;
             uses the same principle. However, for meeting a higher level of service through piped water supply systems&#13;
             on a demand-responsive basis, generally only external funds are used.&#13;
             It must, however, also be recognized that this approach succeeds due to the fact that, unlike most other developing&#13;
        countries, China did not have a long history of large subsidies provided by the central government, and there has&#13;
        always been a greater emphasis on cost sharing by provincial, county, and community institutions. The&#13;
        challenge is greater in more democratic governments with a long history of central government subsidies.&#13;

has enabled a higher level of cost recovery from                                            to maintain momentum, supported by&#13;
communities. An improved sector framework for                                               adequate and appropriate technical&#13;

investment in and management of the water supply                                      household sanitation has evolved towards public&#13;

         Illustrative Examples of Credit for Household Facilities and Community Infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
       NGO-linked credit for household toilets in Vietnam. As a part of the World Bank-funded Three Cities Project in&#13;
       Vietnam, a revolving fund was set up with a local NGO, the Womens Union (WU), to provide credit for&#13;
       household toilets. The WU has over 350 savings and credit groups (SCGs), organized in groups of&#13;
       12 to 15 persons, functioning in these cities. SCGs mobilize savings and provide credit for income generation.&#13;
       Credit for toilets (US$150) is on a short-term basis (two years) with a recovery rate of over 95 percent.&#13;
       The rate of interest, at 6 percent per annum, is probably subsidized in relation to the market. It is backed&#13;
       up by demand generation and hygiene awareness in the monthly meetings of the SCGs. Over 4,000&#13;
       households have borrowed in the first year and the target is to achieve almost full coverage of&#13;
       low-income households.&#13;
             Private financial institution-linked credit for household toilets in India. The Indian Association of Savings and&#13;
       Credit (IASC) was set up jointly by the Palmyrah Society, an NGO in Southern India, and the Housing Development&#13;
       Finance Corporation (HDFC). The IASC has in the past successfully lent funds to its members for household toilets.&#13;
       However, it is now constrained by adequate resources and plans to mobilize resources from HDFC as well as other&#13;
       financial institutions for this purpose. This will require coordination with government subsidy programs along with&#13;
       appropriate grant support for the required social mobilization and hygiene awareness, which cannot be funded&#13;
       through the spreads on lending.&#13;
             Involving MFIs in water supply projects in Ethiopia. A rural water supply and environment project, funded&#13;
       by the Finnish Government, in Amhara Region in Ethiopia, plans to use the local microfinance institution, the&#13;
       Amhara Credit and Savings Institute (ACSI), for routing the project funding to communities as well as for&#13;
       supporting the community-based collection of user fees. The MFI has already been involved with the community&#13;
       through a womens credit scheme from a revolving fund contribution from the first phase of the program. The&#13;
7 6    involvement of the MFI in the second phase can help to establish links with the community-based organization&#13;
       (CBO) and enable it to assess its potential cash flow on a regular basis. This would enable the MFI to provide&#13;
       funding to the CBO for periodic maintenance activities or major repairs. Access to such funds can prove&#13;
       critical for sustainability, as lack of timely repairs in rural water supply often results in decapitalization and&#13;
       nonfunctional schemes.&#13;
             Credit for rainwater tanks in rural areas of Tamil Nadu. The Dhan Foundation, an NGO working in rural&#13;
       India, has been working with tank associations in rural Tamil Nadu for development and rehabilitation of tanks&#13;
       for irrigation and drinking water. Tanks harvest rainwater for irrigation in drought-prone areas that rely largely on&#13;
       rain for water. So far, the self-help groups promoted by the DHAN Foundation have funded this through their&#13;
       members. Based on a request from the DHAN Foundation, the IDFC has been exploring the possibility of&#13;
       financing this activity. An analysis of the viability (based on a monthly payment by each household) suggests&#13;
       that this project can support commercial financing. However, actual funding would require proper risk&#13;
       management and appropriate project sponsors.&#13;
             Parivartan: Ahmedabad. Ahmedabad evolved approaches for citywide scaling up of services through its&#13;
       Parivartan Project. Under this, the municipal government has worked with community-based organizations,&#13;
       NGOs, the private sector, and the renowned microfinance institution, SEWA Bank. The community provides a&#13;
       third of the capital costs of upgradation. Key features of the program include a clear set of rules for community&#13;
       contributions and types of infrastructure to be provided, formation and participation of CBOs in infrastructure&#13;
       provision, and the commitment of municipal resources to the program. A special implementation arrangement&#13;
       is also planned through the Ahmedabad Slum Upgrading Society (ASUS) with participation by both the municipal&#13;
       authority and leading local NGOs. Nevertheless, the pace of implementation has remained slow. A secure&#13;
       multi-year financing package and development of effective slum resident associations to take over local-level&#13;
       management may improve this. Attention will also be needed on improving the capacity of the service provider&#13;
       to cope with the resultant rise in demand, particularly for water.&#13;

&#13;
                                 Supporting Scaling up of Community Infrastructure Finance&#13;
&#13;
          A recent initiative explores the possibilities of scaling up some of the opportunities described in Box 3.14 for&#13;
          financing household and community-level infrastructure for the poor and low-income groups.&#13;
                 Community-Led Infrastructure Finance Facility (CLIFF). CLIFF developed out of a partnership by&#13;
          UK-based Homeless International and its Indian partners, the National Slum Dwellers Federation (NSDF),&#13;
          Mahila Milan (a community-based finance system), and SPARC, a Mumbai-based NGO. DFID primarily funds&#13;
          the CLIFF initiative, which is focused on providing for three critical elements of community&#13;
          infrastructure financing: (a) development of pilot and demonstration projects (b) bridge finance for initial&#13;
          scaling up and (c) partial support for risk management and mitigation. CLIFFs operations require that the&#13;
          basic mobilization work has already been done and a strong institutional base of reputable stakeholders exists.&#13;
          CLIFF will be managed globally by Homeless International and in the first phase will be implemented through&#13;
          a special company (Nirman) set up by the Indian partners. CLIFFs initial projects are likely to focus more on&#13;
          housing, with which Nirman is involved at present. Later infrastructure financing will be taken up in&#13;
          selected urban areas.&#13;
                 This initiative combines the basic features of project development support, partial guarantees for risk&#13;
          mitigation, and accessing market-based investment funds. In another initiative, DFID and the World Bank are&#13;
          assisting the Government of India to develop an approach to involve both microfinance institutions and formal&#13;
          domestic finance institutions in financing community infrastructure. Both these initiatives approach the issue of&#13;
          scaling up with very similar features and program elements, but are housed at two ends of the financing&#13;
          spectrum and possibly would be complementary in practice. Thus, scaling up by market integration is achieved&#13;
          either through building the capacity of local community-based organizations to deal with the formal sector, or&#13;
          through developing capacity and experience among formal finance institutions to understand CBFI and CBO&#13;
          profiles and risks.&#13;

       this requires efforts from the community-based                 other financial institutions (FIs). The first important&#13;
       organizations and the related CBFIs, as well as                constraint involves the lack of a financing space for&#13;
       formal financial institutions, to understand each              financial institutions in community infrastructure&#13;

8 2    very few estimates and analyses of subsidies in a&#13;
       local context are available. A few available studies                             Options for a Good WSS Subsidy&#13;
       (in India and Kenya) suggest the value of subsidy                                       There has been considerable discussion on&#13;
       for water and sanitation to be in the range of                                   what constitutes a good subsidy in the water and&#13;
       0.4 to 0.5 percent of GDP and 4 percent of all                                   sanitation sector, but far less on the actual&#13;

       Millennium Development Goals), the positive                                      characteristics of a good subsidy are identified as:&#13;
       externalities that WSS may generate through                                             Genuine need. It is necessary to assess the&#13;

       traditional system of subsidies often fails to meet                              the level of tariff required for ensuring the financial&#13;
       such objectives. Such subsidies tend to be hidden                                viability of the service provider, the minimum&#13;

       targeted. Recent findings from a limited number                                  income levels among consumers. For example,&#13;
       of studies assessing the incidence of benefits from                              Raghupati and Foster (2002) find that, for urban&#13;
       such subsidies suggest that the benefits accrue                                  India, only about 30 percent of the population&#13;

        Enhanced Community Capital Cost Sharing in Low-income Programs in Urban India&#13;
&#13;
   Parivartan program in Ahmedabad.58 This innovative slum improvement program in Ahmedabad, India, features&#13;
   a tripartite partnership involving the municipal authority, the community, and the private sector, with the capital&#13;
   cost shared equally among them. While the private group withdrew after the initial efforts, local NGOs have&#13;
   been partners and the community cost share has been maintained and is paid upfront. Thus, the partial subsidy&#13;
   to the community is about 67 percent. Key participation in the program comes from the SEWA Cooperative&#13;
   Bank and the SEWA Housing Services Trust to provide financial management, community mobilization, and&#13;
   technical assistance services. The program was launched successfully and, after an initial pilot in one settlement,&#13;
   expanded to nearly 25 slum settlements. However, progress lagged due both to implementation capacity issues&#13;
   and the lack of any committed funding source to meet the municipal corporation obligations.&#13;
          Janmabhoomi program in Andhra Pradesh. In 1997, the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) launched&#13;
   this program with a focus on community-driven development by providing partial subsidies of up to 50 percent&#13;
   of total project costs. These are meant for community-based subprojects managed by the communities themselves&#13;
   in both urban and rural areas. In urban areas the state developed, under a different program, community-based&#13;
   organizations: neighborhood committees (NHCs) at the settlement level, and a community development society,&#13;
   generally comprising several NHCs within a given urban center. These structures provide a base for developing&#13;
   and implementing proposals funded through the Janmabhoomi program.&#13;
          Lessons learned. These new initiatives suggest the potential for enhancing the community share of the&#13;
   capital costs of neighborhood upgrading for low-income urban settlements. Key lessons in this regard include&#13;
   the need for (a) strong community-based organizations to take up the incentives provided by the partial subsidies&#13;
   (b) simple, uniform, and transparent rules across the program area (c) technical support and related institutional&#13;
   capacity for implementation (d) a system to monitor performance and revise the program features through&#13;
   learning by doing and (e) careful design of the nature and extent of the subsidy and rules to ensure fiscal&#13;
   sustainability in case the program is linked to the objective of citywide coverage, as for Parivartan.&#13;

            recovery has been far below this norm.60                                often not been very good. In an example from&#13;

&#13;
         Hundred percent sanitation: WaterAid experience in South Asia. WaterAid has supported community-based participatory&#13;
         approaches for hygiene awareness and promotion of demand for sanitation. Bangladesh achieved&#13;
         100 percent sanitation in five districts without any recourse to household subsidies for latrines, commonly used in most&#13;
         government programs. A clear message emanating from these experiences is the need to put emphasis on demand&#13;
         promotion and community-level incentives, rather than high fixed-cost subsidies that benefit only individual households.&#13;
         At the same time, based on its experience in India, WaterAid has also stated that some financial support is necessary&#13;
         in the initial stages to ensure demand is realized and latrines are constructed to an adequate standard (WSP-SA 2000).&#13;
                Village rewards for sanitation: Maharashtra, India. Based on its own assessment of the lack of utilization&#13;
         of a large proportion of latrines built through government subsidies, the government in this western state of&#13;
         India introduced an innovative scheme to give rewards to villages based on their efforts for complete sanitation.&#13;
         This public sector scheme, known as the Sant Gadge Baba Abhiyan after a local saint, is essentially based&#13;
         entirely on local village-level effort supported jointly by the village-level local government and the village community.&#13;
8 8      Based on transparent criteria and selection of villages for rewards, it provided an incentive to take up improvements&#13;
         in the village through communities own resources and labor contributions. The subsidy (in the form of village&#13;
         rewards) of 66 million rupees (US$1.3 million) has generated action in over 2,000 villages with total investments&#13;
         worth an estimated 2 to 3 billion rupees (US$40 to 60 million).&#13;
                Promoting sanitation through sanitation tax in Burkina Faso. Initiatives for improving sanitation for the poor&#13;
         in urban areas require action on several fronts, including sewerage where necessary. An experience from Burkina&#13;
         Faso provides an illustration where support by the local WSS utility encouraged social mobilization for demand&#13;
         promotion and resulted in a significant increase in sustainable access to latrines. The utility mobilized resources for&#13;
         sanitation through a sanitation tax that is levied on all users of water services including those using public taps.&#13;
         These resources are ring-fenced and used within the framework of a strategic sanitation plan to meet the costs of&#13;
         hygiene awareness and demand promotion, partial subsidies for latrines, and full subsidies for institutional latrines&#13;
         in schools and the sewerage system. The expenditure on demand promotion and social intermediation is almost&#13;
         twice that of partial subsidies given for individual latrine facilities. The share of partial subsidy in the total cost of&#13;
         the latrine has been about 18 percent, though it varies in relation to the technology used.&#13;
                Public-private partnership for handwashing initiatives. A public-private partnership (PPP) through the&#13;
         combined efforts of public, private, and development organizations was initiated first in Central America.&#13;
         Drawing from recent research indicating that the simple act of washing your hands could almost halve the&#13;
         number of deaths from diarrhoeal diseases and save a million lives a year, this initiative combined the energies&#13;
         of the public sector with those of the private sector through the soap manufacturers. Developed within a social&#13;
         marketing approach, the PPP initiative followed a four-phase approach with a focus on stimulating demand,&#13;
         strengthening supply, and building capacity for effective monitoring. This was achieved through partnership&#13;
         development, marketing research and strategy, and innovative use of media. The lessons from the first initiative&#13;
         have now been built into a global campaign initiated in India and Ghana. The initial subsidies in this initiative&#13;
         were used for strategy development and initial promotion. However, it is envisaged that the initiative can&#13;
         become self-sustainable later due to the participation of the private sector, which also has a commercial interest&#13;
         in marketing the handwashing soap.&#13;

      financing, cost recovery for upgrading and                             While past efforts at sanitation largely focused on&#13;
      expanding infrastructure through resident                              provision of latrines, experience suggests the need&#13;
      service charges was not achieved. This was                             to focus on demand promotion, rather than&#13;
      due, in part, to difficulty collecting service                         subsidies for the facilities themselves. Large-scale&#13;

      areas.61 Interestingly recent literature on                            facilities (such as latrines) that lack backing by&#13;
      criteria for success in slum upgradation                               effective demand usually resulted in wasteful&#13;

      contributions. One reason for this outlook&#13;
      may be that the investment in slum                                     unused. For example, studies in Maharashtra,&#13;

      there seems to have been greater emphasis                              a study by WaterAid in South India showed that&#13;

                                               Social Connections in Côte d'Ivoire&#13;
&#13;
         SODECI, a private utility company in Côte dIvoire, operates a social connection policy that enables households&#13;
         in planned areas to access a subsidized connection. All connections that are (a) for domestic use (b) require less&#13;
         than four taps in the house (c) are within 12 meters of the nearest main and (d) are on authorized properties,&#13;
         are eligible to receive a subsidized connection. The subsidy covers a 15-millimeter-diameter pipe from the meter&#13;
         to the house. To fund this subsidy, the national government established and maintains a Water Development&#13;
         Fund (WDF). It is capitalized through a special fee levied on all consumers through a progressive charge&#13;
         whereby those with a higher consumption level pay a higher charge. The utility accesses WDF resources in&#13;
         relation to the number of social connections it provides. The number of water consumers doubled in the last 10&#13;
         years, and the connection rate increased from 5.6 to 8 connections per 100 residents between 1989 and 1998.&#13;
         More than 30,000 social connections were made between 1998 and 2001.&#13;
                Despite its positive aspects, the policy as outlined above inhibits access by a large proportion of the poor&#13;
         living in areas beyond the specified 12 meters, as the utility network does not cover the entire city, and many do&#13;
         not fulfill the legal tenure. Further, as most of the poor completely lack access to water, they depend on&#13;
         communal standpipes or the often illegal resellers who do not receive any subsidies and face considerable risks&#13;
         due to their illegal status. In both these cases the cross-subsidies adversely affect the poor through the incremental&#13;
         block tariffs as they end up paying a higher total price for water. To improve this, a two-pronged approach is&#13;
         necessary: (a) extension of the main utility network to underserved localities with many unauthorized settlements&#13;
         in order to reduce the extension costs and bring the poor within the 12-meter range of networks and (b)&#13;
         reviewing the current informal reselling arrangements, particularly in terms of the connection costs, water&#13;
         tariffs, and legal status within an appropriate regulatory framework. In addition, design of the social connection&#13;
         system needs improvement to avoid perverse incentives for new connections by households that have been&#13;
         disconnected due to payment defaults.&#13;

&#13;
                 Universal Service Fund for Telecommunications in the United States&#13;
&#13;
  Universal service as a goal for telecommunications in the United States was codified as early as 1934 through&#13;
  the Communications Act, which aimed To make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United&#13;
  States a rapid, efficient nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate&#13;
  facilities at reasonable charges. This was reaffirmed in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by establishing&#13;
  policies for the preservation and advancement of Universal Service. Prior to 1983 the AT&amp;T essentially&#13;
  handled the affordability issue through internal cross-subsidies. Its divestiture and subsequent competition&#13;
  through new companies led to the establishment of an explicit Universal Service Fund (USF) in 1983 to keep&#13;
  the telephone services affordable in a competitive telecommunications market. The USF is capitalized through&#13;
  contributions from all telecommunications companies in the United States, including local and long-distance&#13;
  phone companies, wireless and paging companies, and payphone providers. They contribute to the USF less&#13;
  than 4 percent of the amount they billed in the previous year to their residential and business customers for&#13;
  telecommunications services. The exact percentage that companies contribute is adjusted every quarter, based&#13;
  on projected universal service demands. The local companies recover the costs of USF contributions through&#13;
  access charges levied on long-distance companies. The long-distance companies work in a competitive market,&#13;
  and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not heavily regulate their prices. Hence, they are&#13;
  able to make a business decision on whether to include the USF contribution costs in their charges. Those that&#13;
  do include these costs add this explicitly as a universal service fee to the customer bills.&#13;
         Companies that provide telecommunication services to selected groups are eligible to draw money from&#13;
  the USF to defray the costs of delivering discounted services to their consumers. Such compensation is available&#13;
  for meeting the costs of providing services at a discounted price to low-income neighborhoods and communities;&#13;
  to rural areas where the costs are high; and to rural healthcare providers, schools, and libraries.&#13;
         USF is managed by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) under regulations promulgated&#13;
  by the FCC. USAC is a private nonprofit subsidiary company of the National Exchange Carrier Association.&#13;
  USAC administers four programs to match the consumers who receive discounted service. It implements fund&#13;
  rules, notifies companies of their obligations to the fund, collects their contributions, invests the funds, and    9 5&#13;
  makes payments to eligible service providers. It also provides guidance to the constituents of the universal&#13;
  service programs on how to obtain financial support from the fund. A board of directors governs USAC and&#13;
  oversees the actions taken by management and the board committees. The USAC board of directors has 19&#13;
  members and, in addition to the USAC CEO, includes representatives from the telecommunications and&#13;
  information services industry, state telecommunications regulators, state consumer advocates, low-income&#13;
  consumers, and education and library representatives. The board manages the business and affairs of USAC&#13;
  and has established an executive committee and programmatic committees to oversee each USAC division.&#13;
  These committees oversee the budgets and major administrative decisions of their respective divisions and are&#13;
  responsible for reporting to the USAC board. The full USAC board may review any action taken by a committee&#13;
  and has the authority to overrule any action taken by a committee.&#13;

              Auctions for Minimum Subsidy Concessions for Rural Telecommunications in Peru&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          In 1992, Peru began reforming its telecommunications sector, establishing a regulatory authority, Osiptel, and&#13;
          opening the market to competition. These reforms largely neglected the high-cost rural areas, where 30 percent&#13;
          of Peru's population and 50 percent of its extreme poor live. So a fund, Fitel, was created to provide telecom&#13;
          services through promoting private participation. It was designed as a legally distinct entity from Osiptel, although&#13;
          Osiptel provided technical and administrative services to Fitel and approved its policies and projects. The&#13;
          ultimate target was the provision, by 2003, of pay phones in 5,000 rural towns and public access to the Internet&#13;
          in all 554 district capitals. In the end, 5,000 towns were targeted in six regions and held in two tenders with the&#13;
          winner granted a nonexclusive 20-year renewable concession. This required the installation of at least one&#13;
          public payphone in each locality listed, providing access to local long-distance voice and narrow-band data&#13;
          communications, and one point of public access to the Internet in each district capital.&#13;
                  By March 2001, three competitive tenders had been conducted for the six regions covering 5,000 towns,&#13;
          with new contenders, both foreign and domestic, entering the market. The competitive bidding on the pilot&#13;
          project resulted in a subsidy 41 percent lower than Osiptels estimate, and fully 74 percent lower than the&#13;
          incumbent operator offer. A year into the project the average distance to a phone is a tenth of what it was; twice&#13;
          the population in municipalities have phone access; and user needs allowed the operator to introduce&#13;
          prepaid calling cards, dedicated Internet, and long-distance services. Although the operators service suffered in&#13;
          the first six months of the program, 74 percent of the population were satisfied with the overall service, 50&#13;
          percent had access to calling cards; and modest progress had been made in service outages, hours of service,&#13;
          and customer education.&#13;
                  The subsidy of the project came to just US$11 per inhabitant. In comparison, the cost of mobilizing private&#13;
          investment was estimated at US$22 per inhabitant. Administrative costs of the subsidy are also low: after the&#13;
          US$1.7 million in start-up costs, the administrative costs were less than 2 percent of the funds collected.&#13;

&#13;
                               Output-based Aid through Direct Subsidies in Chile&#13;
&#13;
  In the 1990s, as part of an overhaul of its WSS sector, the Government of Chile raised the water tariffs to all users in order&#13;
  to more accurately reflect the true economic cost of the service. Before the reforms, water tariffs covered only 50 percent&#13;
  of costs, which fell to less than 20 percent in regions where production costs were high. By using a direct subsidy structure,&#13;
  the government defrayed some of the water costs to low-income households to ensure adequate consumption at affordable&#13;
  prices. Water utilities, many of which are private, provide the service to the poor at discounted rates ranging from 25 to 85&#13;
  percent up to a limit of 15 cubic meters a month. All consumption above the limit is charged at the full tariff. In return, the&#13;
  water companies receive a subsidy reimbursement from the municipal government for each qualified customer that&#13;
  receives the service in relation to the actual water consumed. The central government actually paid the subsidy.&#13;
        It uses a means-tested subsidy targeted to individual customers rather than a traditional geographic or universal&#13;
  subsidy. Those households unable to purchase a subsistence level of consumption in relation to the World Health&#13;
  Organization (WHO) benchmark of 5 percent of monthly household income for WSS charges are targeted. To obtain&#13;
  a subsidy, a household applies to the municipality, which determines its eligibility on the basis of a scoring system&#13;
  called CAS. CAS is assessed using a questionnaire with over 50 questions canvassed by private survey companies to&#13;
  all those who wish to evaluated. Actual scoring is, however, done by the municipality itself, with subsidies paid for&#13;
  three years, at which stage the household must reapply. This form of consumption subsidy was appropriate given the&#13;
  near universal coverage in urban areas. The direct subsidy used in Chile is within the framework of output-based aid,&#13;
  as the utility receives the subsidy only when it achieves the output of service to the low-income customers. While low-&#13;
  income households tend to lack the attention of water utilities under traditional subsidy schemes, this structure&#13;
  provides the utility with an incentive to serve the poor, as revenues increase with each low-income household that&#13;
  benefits from the subsidy. As the low-income consumers also pay a share of the costs, there is an incentive to avoid the&#13;
  wastage of water generally associated with traditional outright or hidden subsidies. Through this scheme, Chile established&#13;
  a market for water, offering subsidies where they are needed, ensuring profits to the water utility, and meeting the water&#13;
  needs of its citizens. They distributed 450,000 subsidies in 1998, benefiting almost 13 percent of households at an&#13;
  average of US$10 per month, for a total cost of US$33.6 million. In addition to being well below the cost of the previous&#13;
  universal subsidy scheme, the new plan resulted in utility surpluses and net profits of US$107 million. This reduced funding       9 9&#13;
  requirements and demonstrates the efficiencies associated with better targeting.&#13;

                 Enhancing Access through an OBA Arrangement in Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal&#13;
&#13;
        Privately managed utilities in Côte dIvoire and Senegal provide subsidies for social connections to ensure&#13;
        maximization of access to the utility networks they operated. Both follow some form of OBA structure, though&#13;
        each is structured differently in terms of selection of beneficiaries and administration of subsidies.&#13;
              In Côte dIvoire there are very simple administrative arrangements and targeting is not very strict. The&#13;
        subsidy of about 90 percent of the cost of connection is available to all those seeking a 15-millimeter domestic&#13;
        connection and who reside within 12 meters of a utility main. This has resulted in low administrative costs, but&#13;
        the program may be too successful in that the subsidies have accrued to over 90 percent of household connections&#13;
        installed over the last 10 years. On the other hand, the program fails to reach the customers who do not reside&#13;
        within the areas served by utility networks. SODECI, the private company, is reimbursed a flat fee for each&#13;
        subsidized connection from the Water Development Fund (WDF) on approval from the Ministry of Infrastructure.&#13;
        WDF is funded through a fee on all water tariffs. Though this is within an OBA structure, there are perverse&#13;
        incentives for the service provider to maximize the connections and for the consumers to also claim subsidies for&#13;
        new connections, sometimes even for reconnection after being cut off for not paying tariffs. These issues need&#13;
        to be addressed.&#13;
              In Senegal, following a strategy of reform in the country, a private operator has been engaged to provide&#13;
        water services in urban areas. To pacify the apprehensions regarding a rise in water prices, the government&#13;
        followed a strategy of ensuring subsidized access to all deserving households, using a fixed affordable price for&#13;
        a social block of 10 cubic meters per month. The targeting system in Senegal for this preferential treatment is&#13;
        stricter and the related administrative costs are higher than in Côte dIvoire, though with better targeting being&#13;
        achieved. The access subsidies cover water and sewer connections as well as provision of shared water fountains&#13;
        in selected peri-urban areas and are being financed from special grants from different donors. While these&#13;
        subsidies are for new connections for the poor, adequate detail of the payment structures is not available, which&#13;
        makes it difficult to assess the nature of incentives through this system.&#13;
100           In Côte dIvoire, it would be useful to explore the tradeoffs between undue leakages in subsidies for social&#13;
        connections and funding expansion of utility networks, particularly to localities dominated by low-income&#13;
        groups. In both countries, focus is also needed on alternative approaches for ensuring access to the poor and&#13;
        low-income groups, such as improved linkages with the informal water resellers.&#13;

   of the rural population of 3.1 million. Capitalizing on the entrepreneurial spirit of its citizens, the Government of&#13;
   Paraguay looked to its small-scale private providers, locally known as aguateros, to help bring water to the&#13;
   peri-urban poor of Asuncion and Ciudad del Este. Aguateros formed out of the need for people living within&#13;
   marginalized areas of the urban landscape to obtain access to water. Typically, aguateros identify a community           101&#13;
   in need with an average demand of 100 households, drill boreholes, establish a well and pump system, invest&#13;
   in a piping infrastructure, and sell water to local residents. Estimates of aguateros number between 350 and&#13;
   600 and indicate that they serve about 500,000 people, representing an investment of US$30 million (US$250/&#13;
   household). The development is entirely private, with the aguateros targeting a growing settlement, purchasing&#13;
   a lot, building a well and pump house, and finally selling water to the first groups of settlers. The entire&#13;
   investment and associated risks lie with the aguateros and have to be recovered within three years for the project&#13;
   to be profitable. The water fees are usually considerably lower than those levied by the public water company,&#13;
   and they tend to be well measured. Additionally, the aguateros can maintain a highly flexible relationship with&#13;
   the client, allowing for adaptations to account for fluctuations in payments. This prolongs both coverage and&#13;
   sustainability of the scheme, and indicates that even the lowest-income groups can pay the full cost of water as&#13;
   long as the service conforms to their circumstances.&#13;
         Within SENASAs service area, there is a need to serve an additional two million people by 2010 to reach&#13;
   the 85 percent target coverage. However, total estimated costs range from US$100 to 200 million, and at&#13;
   current levels of subsidy this target appears unattainable. To overcome this, SENASA has started to explore the&#13;
   possibility of subsidy-linked concessions, which would help leverage private sector resources by introducing a&#13;
   pilot program under an ongoing World Bank-funded rural water supply and sanitation project. This envisages&#13;
   small private operators bidding on 10-year concessions to design, build, and operate WSS systems in four small&#13;
   towns. The concessions include fixed subsidies linked to the number of connections actually made. The subsidies&#13;
   are about US$150 per connection, 25 percent lower than the subsidies generally available to the juntas. The&#13;
   water tariffs to be charged are fixed, and the main bidding variable is the operators minimum connection&#13;
   charge for each connection. In practice the operator may charge in installments at an interest rate not exceeding&#13;
   24 percent. Special features are also made available as departures from a pure OBA structure to respond to the&#13;
   ground realities: partial (20 percent) mobilization payment against bank guarantees, borehole insurance for&#13;
   repeated failure to draw minimum water flow, and subsidies linked to some houses (up to one-sixth) on covered&#13;
   streets, even if they do not connect. After initial regulatory problems related to an appropriate conceding&#13;
   authority, there has been considerable local interest, and the bidding process is ongoing at present.&#13;

                                           Promoting Sector Reforms&#13;
a. Decentralization-linked Mechanisms:&#13;
s Countries with emerging decentralization policies with clear policy and legislation for local mandates and a&#13;
    focus on enhancing capacity of local governments for managing improved service delivery&#13;
&#13;
b. Special Fund Mechanisms:&#13;
s Where decentralization reforms are not forthcoming or community-driven development for infrastructure services&#13;
    is not accepted readily, or where the poor and low-income groups need support in negotiating with LAs&#13;
s Where high transaction and political costs are likely to be a deterrent to institutional reforms&#13;
&#13;
c. Programmatic Approaches:&#13;
s Where there is a general agreement on sector reforms and the national government has adopted broader&#13;
    reforms for public expenditure management and budgeting. Strong leadership of sector ministry is essential&#13;
s Where institutional reforms are possible at least in the medium term&#13;
&#13;
                                        Leveraging Additional Resources&#13;
a. Private Sector Participation and Investments:&#13;
s Countries where an overall reform climate in infrastructure sector exists, and there is some level of financial&#13;
    autonomy for independent utilities with an emphasis on internal cash generation through appropriate&#13;
    pricing and operational efficiency&#13;
s Partial guarantees relevant where transactions are developed but the borrowing entities lack credit history,&#13;
    need to cover policy risks, or where lack of long-term debt adversely affects project financial viability&#13;
s Project development support relevant where there are some creditworthy borrowers and possible opportunity                 107&#13;
    for good transactions, but a lack of capacity for project development potential among borrowers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
b. Local Investments through Local Credit Markets:&#13;
s MDFs or special financial intermediaries are relevant where there is a reasonable level of existing/emerging&#13;
    municipal capacity but a low level of financial sector development or a lack of interest among the FIs in the&#13;
    municipal sector&#13;
s Direct market access is more appropriate where there is high financial sector and capital market development&#13;
    and a reasonable level of creditworthiness for borrowers. Pooled financing is relevant in case of many&#13;
    small borrowers&#13;
&#13;
c. Enhancing Household and Community Resources:&#13;
s Would be relevant in all contexts where there is some level of ability and willingness to pay for WSS services&#13;
s Would be more viable when government policy enables community share in infrastructure&#13;
    finance and a good base and outreach available of strong CBOs, CBFIs and interest among domestic&#13;
    financial institutions&#13;

                                          Improving Pro-poor Subsidies&#13;
a. Subsidies for Access to Water and Sanitation:&#13;
s In all developing countries where large shortfalls in access to safe rural water supply systems are prevalent: the&#13;
    level of subsidies should be linked to affordability, WTP, and fiscal viability at scale&#13;
s Demand promotion for sanitation and hygiene awareness is relevant in all developing countries where&#13;
    coverage of access to and use of safe sanitation is low and hygiene awareness needs to be enhanced&#13;
s Social connections are appropriate when urban water service providers have well-functioning networks but&#13;
    low levels of access to these for the poor&#13;

         b. Improving Cross-subsidies through Water Tariffs:&#13;
&#13;
         s     In contexts where they have been used in the past, and/or politically and administratively they appear&#13;
               relevant and necessary: use of minimum subsidy auction can improve determination of level of subsidies&#13;
         s     Universal service funds may be used where universal service policy for WSS is explicitly adopted and its cost&#13;
               (less other government subsidies) as a proportion of total sector turnover is reasonable&#13;
&#13;
         c. Output-based Aid:&#13;
         s Direct subsidies may be used where utilities are able to provide reliable water services and the information&#13;
               and administrative capacities for cost-effective identification of the poor and low-income groups exists&#13;
         s Subsidy-linked concessions may be used where affordability and willingness to pay for services among the poor&#13;
               is less than the service costs, and a base of small private providers with capacity to bid for concessions exists&#13;
         s In contexts where there is commitment to reforms, but the cost of immediate reforms may be high or&#13;
               gradual, reforms are necessary for political reasons&#13;

            Meeting the financing challenge for water
            supply and sanitation - incentives to promote reforms,
            leverage resources, and improve targeting
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The priority actions suggested by the
            Millennium Development Goals, and the World Summit on
            Sustainable Development to enhance access to safe water
            supply and basic sanitation, pose new challenges to the
            sector, and provide new opportunities to make significant
            progress on poverty reduction. While additional financial
            resources will help to meet these challenges, infrastructure
            investments alone, do not ensure sustainability, efficient
            use of existing resources, community and private sector
            participation, better and sustained access to services, and
            increased coverage for all. To ensure progress, we must put
            in place appropriate, and effective financing mechanisms
            that leverage the needed change, promote and support sector
            reforms that yield effective institutional frameworks,
            guarantee appropriate use of limited public resources, and
            encourage well-targeted subsidies to achieve equity. This
            paper, a review and synthesis of innovative financing in the
            water and sanitation sector, emphasizes the critical
            importance of mechanisms that 1) promote and support sound
            policies and reform, 2) leverage more domestic resources
            from providers, users, and local governments, and, 3) help
            to improve the use of subsidies for the poor. The paper also
            identifies key issues that can guide the choice of financing
            mechanisms in different contexts. Its main objectives are
            to: develop a framework for a review of financing mechanisms
            for water supply and sanitation; provide a global review of
            financing mechanisms, on the development and use of
            innovative financing mechanisms; and, identify the
            directions for further research.
