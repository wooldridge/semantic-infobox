ANNEX I&#13;
Charter, Description of Activities ; nd Expenditures under the Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
for the I nowled;,,e for Change Program II (KCP II)&#13;
The purpose of the K CP II is to act as an effective, transparent and efficient vehicle for&#13;
the pooling of intelle tual an I fli ianci al resources and to generate new knowledge in support of&#13;
the Bank's mission. It will ,nec urag.- and improve dialogue with partner agencies, developing&#13;
country clients, and other int rested parties. Building on the gains of KCP I and the&#13;
recommendations of the Prog am Eva uation (November 2007), the fundamental objective of the&#13;
KCP II is to promote high qualily, ct tting edge research (including data collection in the direct&#13;
context of research) that creatts ktowledge to support policies for poverty reduction and&#13;
sustainable development. A si ibsidiar, objective is to assist the development of research capacity&#13;
in client countries.&#13;
Focus of activities to be supporled&#13;
The KCP II will suplpor inn wative research programs sponsored by the Development&#13;
Economics Vice Presidency ()EC) of the Bank, in conjunction with other parts of the Bank The&#13;
fDcus will be on economic atud social knowledge-generation activities, with a multi-disciplinary&#13;
approach towards the latter.&#13;
Geographically, the k CP II fi nds will be targeted towards activities concerning the IDA&#13;
countries and/or the poorest grojps in IBRD countries, with particular priority for Africa and&#13;
Asia, both of which have lai ge and ntractable poverty problems. However, other regions and&#13;
countries, including raiddle incotrie, are not excluded since many of the world's absolutely poor&#13;
are found in those countrieE ard w )rk in those countries, activities from other regions and&#13;
countries may be used for coriparisor purposes, lessons learned, and for other economic links to&#13;
the priority countries.&#13;
There will be four 1 rus: Funds under the KCP II for research related to overarching&#13;
themes of (i) Poverty Dynamics ind Public Service Delivery, (ii) Investment Climate and Trade&#13;
and Integration, (iii) Global Public Goods, and (iv) Economic Development and Structural&#13;
Change. The first addresse:, issues at the heart of poverty reduction, empowerment and&#13;
sustainable development; thc seconc focuses on the major elements of a business program&#13;
conducive to growth, with eniphasis (n the role of small- and medium-scale industries; the third&#13;
focuses on global issjes that req iire ,ollective action and coordination across countries because&#13;
lack of action or progress in som- coi ntries could undermine benefits for all; and the fourth will&#13;
analyze the policies and factors that a e necessary to make it possible for a developing country to&#13;
u pgrade its industrial structure contint ously and develop rapidly.&#13;
Indicative programs that will b sul ported include:&#13;
A. Poverty Dynamics and Pi iblic Sei vice Delivery&#13;
Poverty measuremenr. Improving the tools used in the Bank for monitoring, describing&#13;
and forecasting income jove ty and inequality, including aggregate poverty measures,&#13;
sharper poverty profil es, and I etter household surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-5-                        February 11, 2013&#13;
*  Pro-poor growth. To adv ance understanding of what makes pro-poor growth and the role&#13;
played by governmen, irclud ng the role of initial conditions, what drives distributional&#13;
changes in survey dat., and ch irning (the gainers and losers).&#13;
*  Social inclus.!on and empowt rment. How best to mitigate different forms of inequality&#13;
(for example, gender ind ethn [city) and promote social inclusion and empowerment, and&#13;
civic engagement and par ticip ttion.&#13;
* Conflict. An analysis of ,onfl ct issues: war, terrorism, crime and violence.&#13;
*  Sustainable developmem. Ho v to frame poverty reduction strategies which take account&#13;
of the probl!ms an. confli;ts caused by socioeconomic inequalities, demographic&#13;
stresses, the struggle fbr control of resource rents, and environmental damage and natural&#13;
resource degradation.&#13;
*  Public service deliveiy for hi man development. An evaluation and analysis of delivery&#13;
options, prioritizing initially e lucation and health sectors, with a focus on provision at the&#13;
local level, and examinirg thc hypothesis that greater participation by households using&#13;
the service acts to improv e set vice performance.&#13;
*  Social protection. H4 ow to hi lp people manage risk, cope with adverse shocks, avoid&#13;
variability in incomes an d sm )oth consumption.&#13;
B. Investment Climate and Trale aj d Integration&#13;
*  Internationai migrat on and development. This research program aims to advance the&#13;
understanding of the deN elop nent impact of migration on sending countries as well as&#13;
identifying policies, regulat ons and institutional reforms for improved migration&#13;
outcomes and a "win win-wit " situation for developing and developed countries and for&#13;
migrants.&#13;
*  Stability and growth. Tiis r,-search program includes the medium-term prospects for&#13;
world economic growth ind leveloping country growth; a shift in trade policy analysis&#13;
from the traditional tar ff a.;enda to services and investment liberalization, product&#13;
standards and proper y fight,, and competition policies; more effective deployment of&#13;
international resourcc flows both public and private); and how to make globalization&#13;
more pro-pocr.&#13;
*   Governance and inA ritutiom. The role of institutions and governance in creating an&#13;
attractive climate for private sector development, including anti-corruption programs; the&#13;
institutional reforms necded to generate private investment and job creation; and the&#13;
interactions cf behavior znd social and economic outcomes.&#13;
*  Finance and develooment. [he program is organized around two areas - access to&#13;
financial services an,[ fiinanct for the poor, which directly addresses the empowerment&#13;
aspects of poverty.&#13;
*  Regulation and infrustructui e. A review of the elements of a regulatory framework and&#13;
of the provision of in ras ruct ire conducive to a healthy climate for investment.&#13;
*   Urban development. How to enhance the contribution of urban development to poverty&#13;
reduction and econon ic grow :h.&#13;
*  Rural development. Definil ion and access regulation of rights to key productive&#13;
resources (e.g. land and vatei), the functioning of rural markets, the impact of key public&#13;
goods services on rui al I velil toods, rural non-farm employment, the development impact&#13;
of community-based rur 1 org anizations, insurance and risk mitigation in agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-                        February 11, 2013&#13;
C. Global Public Goods&#13;
*   Climate change - mitigation and adaptation. Identifying policy and regulatory reforms&#13;
to mitigate GHG emissic ns b ised on improved understanding of the climate threat, its&#13;
differentiated econorr ic mpa.t across the globe, the effectiveness and cost-benefit of&#13;
different interventions and responses, the need to address adaptation problems for&#13;
vulnerable co intries a ad treas (the longer mitigation actions are delayed), and the need to&#13;
build local capacity to coinple nent international commitments.&#13;
* Deforestation and biudiv ?rsitj . There is a need to better understand how local ecosystem&#13;
destruction can be slowed down in cost-effective ways before global impacts grow as&#13;
carbon and hydrologi :al :yclt s, or species mutation rates are affected through the scale&#13;
and speed of human iriterventi ns in natural processes.&#13;
*  Communicable disea.es. In oi der to better assess and manage this global risk in a period&#13;
of rapid and growin: trade and travel, policymakers need analysis of the costs and&#13;
benefits of reducing ihe risk of disease emergence; early-waming disease monitoring&#13;
programs; avoidance of .mer Yence of resistant strains; vaccine development; alternate&#13;
programs for vaccine deployi ient; alternative quarantine systems (and determinants of&#13;
compliance); .tc.&#13;
*  Knowledge and intellectualp -operty rights (IPRs). This is the next generation of assets&#13;
that can increase or decrease E lobal inclusiveness with consequences for the evolution of&#13;
fair and effective glo ral insti utions. There is a need to better understand policies and&#13;
programs to s:rengthe i th- caf acity of developing countries to develop their own patents,&#13;
to participate in intcmationl discussions, and to analyze the merits inter alia of&#13;
collaborative efforts it faten examination, standards for the breadth and novelty of&#13;
patent claims, protection of rig4ts to genetic resources and traditional knowledge, etc.&#13;
*   Governance and insiltutPons to provide Global Public Goods (GPGs). In a world of&#13;
sovereign entities, there i:; no )lobal authority to coordinate and enforce the provision of&#13;
global public goods. "heie is i need to identify and evaluate innovative institutions and&#13;
mechanisms (incentives and 1)urden sharing/compensation arrangements) to encourage&#13;
fuller participation in addressing Global Public Goods problems and complying with&#13;
agreements -- including iiistitt tions and mechanisms capable of picking up signals early,&#13;
reconciling conflicting natior al and international interests, and creating commitment&#13;
devices that ensure de ive -y of GPGs over the long term.&#13;
D. Economic Development aId Struo tural Change&#13;
*  Patterns of ifdustrialization. As a foundation for this entire research program, it is&#13;
crucial to understand, sys ema ically, how countries develop economically, what types of&#13;
economic trarsformat onE tak( place, and how these are reflected in shifts among sectors&#13;
of the economy. The research will focus on the role of industrialization in development,&#13;
and when and how do.s ii take s root,&#13;
*  Innovation and techi nol6gica upgrading. Technological upgrading and innovation are&#13;
essential ingredients for 1ong- un productivity growth, itself the main driver of long-run&#13;
income growth. In de'veloping countries, they typically take the form of adaptation and&#13;
adoption of known t.chnolog ies rather than introduction of new ones. However, the&#13;
incentives and obstacLhs t0 the ;e processes are still poorly understood. Further, they often&#13;
involve exterialities :hat mal lead to too low a rate of technological upgrading and&#13;
require some form of policy i itervention. The proposed research seeks to shed light on&#13;
these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-                        February 11, 2013&#13;
*  Country case studies of vucc,,ss and failure. This research will build on the work on&#13;
patterns of industriali:,.ation. Y.fter identifying the countries that have been particularly&#13;
successful or unsucce;sftl in industrializing and development, it will use a case-study&#13;
approach to dig deepl) into the strategies and policies that were most responsible.&#13;
*   The optimal financia,' stucture. There is a need to better understand what the optimal&#13;
financial structure is lependir g on the level of industrialization and development. The&#13;
nature of productive actiNity -v,ill vary depending on the development level, and so will&#13;
the nature of risk and tl e ab lity to bear different kinds of risks. Since the financial&#13;
sector's purpose is in large pa t to finance productive activity and to share risk, it seems&#13;
logical that the optima'. fit anci il structure will also vary with the level of development.&#13;
*   The process of indusiriaiizati n in Sub-Saharan Africa. The development struggles of&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa are well enown, but it is perhaps less well appreciated how little&#13;
progress there has b en in it dustrialization. The industrial share of GDP of African&#13;
economies hardly grew at all between the early 1970s and the late 1990s, and within&#13;
industry, manufacturing a so g -ew only slowly, in marked contrast to developments in the&#13;
high-performing Asian economies. By and large, the region has not yet made the&#13;
manufacturing transition hat, in the historical record so far, has been nearly essential to&#13;
development. This re:;earch  'ill focus on the question of why so many Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa countries have iot madc this transition, and what can be done to hasten it.&#13;
Governance structure&#13;
The Bank will be resr onsible 'or administering the KCP II. However, other development&#13;
partners will have an importa it role it its management. The governance structure of the KCP II&#13;
wNill include a Consulkative G oup (CG), an Internal Management Committee (IMC), a Program&#13;
Administration Unit (PAU), aid a Panl of External Technical Experts.&#13;
The CG will -onsist of represrntatives of the official donors, developing country policy&#13;
makers, the World Bank and other iiterested parties, and will be chaired by the Senior Vice&#13;
President and Chief Economis t, EEC (or his nominee). The CG will meet once a year to consider&#13;
long-term strategies and pro-ide gen,-ral guidance on the operation of the trust funds in the&#13;
context of DEC's program an a whol . The CG will also be engaged in the discussion of the&#13;
annual work program and financia l plan and will review the KCP II's performance on the basis of&#13;
an annual report on the acti- itie; fin mced by the KCP II during the previous twelve months.&#13;
Decisions will be made by co iseisus. In conjunction with the annual CG meeting, the Bank may&#13;
organize a seminar to discuss a specif c topic concerning knowledge creation of relevance to the&#13;
group.&#13;
The IMC will be chai -ed by tf e Senior Vice President and Chief Economist, DEC (or his&#13;
nominee). The IMC will incl.ide repr.:sentatives of DEC and the Bank's operational units. The&#13;
IMC will invite proposals froi n E EC ;nd from DEC in conjunction with other parts of the Bank,&#13;
periodically, and review them against he agreed criteria, selecting proposals for financing in light&#13;
of the funds available at a pat tict lar t me, and taking into account the geographical and thematic&#13;
balance of the KCP portfolio.&#13;
The PAU will handle the day- o-day business of the KCP II and will be a point of contact&#13;
for routine issues. The unit will report to the head of the IMC.&#13;
The Panel of Ext.-rnOl T-chnical Experts will review    and provide ex ante&#13;
recommendations of the proposals to be submitted to the IMC for review and approval. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-8-                        February 11, 2013&#13;
Panel of External Techmical E:.:pei ts w 11 consist of several experts selected by the Bank, and who&#13;
must have substantial experience in re ;earch fields relevant to the KCP II. In addition, and on a&#13;
case by case basis the PAU mE yu e B, nk Peer Reviewers when suitable.&#13;
Procedures and criteria&#13;
Proposals should demons rate relevance to the objectives of the program and details of&#13;
key aspects such as innovation, )artn ers, country participation, deliverables, and development&#13;
impact. Consistent with the funlam ntal objectives of the KCP II as outlined in the first&#13;
paragraph of the Charter, the nece ;sary criteria for assessing proposals are as follows:&#13;
*  be innovative and ablc to prov de new knowledge, which can lead to better development&#13;
policies;&#13;
*  address the objectives of the '"rust Fund (poverty dynamics and basic service delivery,&#13;
investment climate and tr, de a id integration, and global public goods).&#13;
*  be results-focused, while iema ning cost effective.&#13;
The desirable criteria are:&#13;
* demonstrate country parti-ipat on and ownership,&#13;
* incorporate developing; countrn capacity building,&#13;
*  be applicable :o a diffirent cot citry or region, and&#13;
*  demonstrate c Doperati:n mong different parts of the Bank and/or between the Bank and&#13;
other donors/agencies.&#13;
Funding&#13;
The funding of activities pe-formed or supported by the KCP II requires a well-&#13;
coordinated partnership involving the World Bank Group, other multilateral institutions and&#13;
donor organizations, as well ais the aE reement and active cooperation of governments in which&#13;
KCP II-financed activities take ph.ce.&#13;
Donors, if they so desire, may specify the allocation of their contribution among the four&#13;
Trust Funds under the KCP II. Scme donors may also wish to express a preference for a certain&#13;
program activity or activities, and thei views will be taken into consideration when activities are&#13;
selected for funding from the KCP. I- owever, the Bank's Trust Fund Policy Guidelines do not&#13;
guarantee that such pr-ference,; in iy b fulfilled.&#13;
Communication with the KC P II Do iors&#13;
In addition to the anr ual CG meeting, the Bank will maintain regular communications&#13;
with donors during the course o' the year, including updating the donors during the Call for&#13;
Proposal stage and providing resu ts ol the IMC decision meetings on project proposals. The KCP&#13;
web site will provide up-to-date infoimation on team composition, activities and new projects&#13;
approved by the IMC, as well as links to the papers and other publications funded by the KCP II.&#13;
T e Bank, as necessary, will organize ;n information meeting or workshop in connection with the&#13;
Bank/IMF's Spring or Annual Mc etinj s on topics and activities relevant to the KCP II to discuss&#13;
methods, present initial findings, and solicit comments and suggestions from donors, including&#13;
their chief economists and advisers. Furthermore, the Bank will establish a data portal for easy&#13;
ac:ess to relevant dala gathered throt gh projects funded by the KCP II, while abiding by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-9-                        February 11, 2013&#13;

update a contact list of donor rep -eser tatives for dissemination of periodic information related to&#13;
th- activities of the program. )or ors , hould inform the PAU on a timely manner of any changes&#13;
in respect of their KCP? II repr.-settatiN -s.&#13;
