All people aspire to receive quality, affordable health care. In recent years, this aspiration has&#13;
spurred calls for universal health coverage (UHC) and has given birth to a global UHC&#13;
movement. In 2005, this movement led the World Health Assembly to call on governments to&#13;
â&#128;&#156;develop their health systems, so that all people have access to services and do not suffer&#13;
financial hardship paying for them.â&#128;? In December 2012, the movement prompted the United&#13;
Nations General Assembly to call on governments to â&#128;&#156;urgently and significantly scale-up efforts&#13;
to accelerate the transition towards universal access to affordable and quality healthcare&#13;
services.â&#128;? Today, some 30 middle-income countries are implementing programs that aim to&#13;
advance the transition to UHC, and many other low- and middle-income countries are&#13;
considering launching similar programs.&#13;
The World Bank supports the efforts of countries to share prosperity by transitioning toward&#13;
UHC with the objectives of improving health outcomes, reducing the financial risks associated&#13;
with ill health, and increasing equity. The Bank recognizes that there are many paths toward UHC&#13;
and does not endorse a particular path or set of organizational or financial arrangements to reach&#13;
it. Regardless of the path chosen, successful implementation requires that many instruments and&#13;
institutions be in place. While different paths can be taken to expand coverage, all paths involve&#13;
implementation challenges. With that in mind, the World Bank launched the Universal Health&#13;
Coverage Studies Series (UNICO Study Series) to develop knowledge and operational tools&#13;
designed to help countries tackle these implementation challenges in ways that are fiscally&#13;
sustainable and that enhance equity and efficiency. The UNICO Studies Series consists of&#13;
technical papers and country case studies that analyze different issues related to the challenges of&#13;
UHC policy implementation.&#13;
The case studies in the series are based on the use of a standardized protocol to analyze the nuts&#13;
and bolts of programs that have expanded coverage from the bottom upâ&#128;&#148;programs that have&#13;
started with the poor and vulnerable rather than those initiated in a trickle-down fashion. The&#13;
protocol consists of nine modules with over 300 questions that are designed to elicit a detailed&#13;
understanding of how countries are implementing five sets of policies to accomplish the&#13;
following: (a) manage the benefits package, (b) manage processes to include the poor and&#13;
vulnerable, (c) nudge efficiency reforms to the provision of care, (d) address new challenges in&#13;
primary care, and (e) tweak financing mechanisms to align the incentives of different&#13;
stakeholders in the health sector. To date, the nuts and bolts protocol has been used for two&#13;
purposes: to create a database comparing programs implemented in different countries, and to&#13;
produce case studies of programs in 24 developing countries and one high-income â&#128;&#156;comparator,â&#128;?&#13;
the state of Massachusetts in the United States. The protocol and case studies are being published&#13;
as part of the UNICO Studies Series, and a comparative analysis will be available in 2013.&#13;
We trust that the protocol, case studies, and technical papers will provide UHC implementers&#13;
with an expanded toolbox, make a contribution to discussions about UHC implementation, and&#13;
that they will inform the UHC movement as it continues to expand worldwide.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Chile relies on social health insurance (SHI) to provide nearly universal health coverage to its 17&#13;
million people. Its SHI system has long been criticized for having two separate subsystems: a&#13;
large public insurer (the National Health Fund, Fonasa) covering three-fourths of the population,&#13;
including the indigent and low-and middle-income citizens, and providing health services mostly&#13;
through public providers; and several for-profit private insurers (Isapres) that cover about one-&#13;
sixth of the better-off population and providing services almost exclusively in the private sector.&#13;
Further, until 2005 the SHI system lacked an explicit benefits package that allowed for large&#13;
differences in the content and quality of services between Fonasa and the Isapres. It has also&#13;
made it possible for Isapres to engage in risk selection.&#13;
&#13;
A reform implemented in 2005, known as Universal Access with Explicit Guarantees (Acceso&#13;
Universal con GarantÃ­as ExplÃ­citas, AUGE), defined a basic package for SHI consisting of&#13;
guaranteed and explicit treatments for 56 priority health problems. In 2010, these were expanded&#13;
to 69 priority problems and a current government initiative will further broaden the package to&#13;
cover 80 health problems. The AUGE benefits package not only guarantees treatments, but also&#13;
sets upper limits on waiting time and out-of-pocket payment for treatment. Coverage for the&#13;
services left out of the AUGE benefits package is not guaranteed by Fonasa, although the public&#13;
insurer devotes more than one-half of its budget to finance non-AUGE services. Isapres provide&#13;
coverage beyond AUGE, but this additional coverage varies from beneficiary to beneficiary&#13;
depending on their premium contribution and the health plan purchased.&#13;
&#13;
The AUGE reform has been accompanied by a sizable increase in total health spending in the&#13;
country, both from public and private sources. Total real health spending per capita grew by 155&#13;
percent, from Ch$283,000 (US$542) to Ch$721,000 (US$1,384), 2 although it has stabilized as a&#13;
share of gross domestic product at around 7.5 percent. Out-of-pocket health spending has dropped&#13;
10 percentage points as a share of health financing in the country, from nearly 50 percent in 2000&#13;
to about 38 percent in 2011.&#13;
&#13;
AUGE has improved access to health services for all, including the poor and the other&#13;
beneficiaries of Fonasa. In Fonasa, this phenomenon has not only been observed for AUGE-&#13;
covered services, but also for other health services not included in the AUGE benefits package.&#13;
The government has expanded public providersâ&#128;&#153; capacity to meet the growing demand for AUGE&#13;
and non-AUGE benefits.&#13;
&#13;
The generous benefits package offered by Fonasa to its indigent population (AUGE plus non-&#13;
AUGE services) has led hundreds of thousands of individuals to underreport their income in&#13;
order to qualify as indigent beneficiaries. Fonasa has recently taken measures to limit this abuse.&#13;
&#13;
A current reform proposal seeking to limit risk selection and enhance beneficiary mobility in&#13;
Isapres may further expand the benefits package of Isapres beyond AUGE. This would legitimize&#13;
a large difference in health benefits between the public and private insurers and may lead to&#13;
political pressure to further expand AUGE for all citizens. Such a scenario may not be fiscally&#13;
possible and poses the risk that efforts to guarantee all services in the SHI system will eventually&#13;

&amp;#12;1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Most countries that have adopted the social health insurance (SHI) model to achieve universal&#13;
health coverage (UHC) took an incremental approach, first enrolling civil servants and formal&#13;
sector workers, and later covering the poor. Chile, which reached nearly universal health&#13;
coverage through SHI in the mid-20th century, instead offered publicly subsidized coverage for&#13;
the poor early on in the evolution of SHI. Chile was also a pioneer in the development of a&#13;
national health service that comprised a countrywide network of public primary health care&#13;
centers and hospitals. 3&#13;
&#13;
This paper focuses on recent and significant health reform implemented in 2005, known as&#13;
Universal Access with Explicit Guarantees (Acceso Universal con GarantÃ­as ExplÃ­citas, AUGE or&#13;
GES), 4 which mandated SHI insurers to adopt a broad benefits package defined via explicit legal&#13;
guarantees for all beneficiaries. This innovative reform is a policy reaction to that which&#13;
previously existed in Chile and which is widespread in many developing countries, whereby the&#13;
health rights of citizens remain largely undefined or implicit. Limited public resources imply in&#13;
those countries that access to health care is rationed through queues, patient deflection, legal or&#13;
under-the-table user fees, and low-quality care. The new policy legally requires that all SHI&#13;
insurers deliver preventive and curative health guarantees for priority diseases according to&#13;
treatment protocols, within specific time limits, and with copayment ceilings. Thus, Chileâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
previous, fiscally convenient policy of vague health benefits has been replaced by one that&#13;
requires strict public commitment to the financing of SHI health benefits because they are now a&#13;
legal right of all.&#13;
&#13;
The AUGE law governs the entire Chilean SHI system. It therefore applies to the indigent&#13;
covered by the large public insurer known as the National Health Fund (Fonasa), the nonindigent&#13;
members of Fonasa, and the higher-income beneficiaries of the private SHI insurers known as&#13;
Isapres. This paper describes the AUGE reform, its implementation, and the functioning of&#13;
AUGE for the poor and for nonpoor citizens.&#13;
&#13;
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief historic overview of health&#13;
coverage in Chileâ&#128;&#153;s SHI system. Section 3 describes the SHI system in existence today. Section 4&#13;
describes the services offered and mechanisms in place to cover the poor under SHI, while&#13;
Section 5 spells out the benefits of SHI. Section 6 introduces the AUGE health reform of 2005,&#13;
which sought to broaden and make explicit the rights of all SHI beneficiaries. Section 7 offers&#13;
information about the flows and magnitudes of health financing in SHI. Section 8 focuses on the&#13;
system used by Fonasa to target the poor. Section 9 explains how Fonasa manages AUGE.&#13;
Section 10 comments on the information environment of AUGE. Section 11 addresses the equity&#13;
and fiscal implications of expanding the AUGE benefits. Finally, section 12 proposes a pending&#13;
policy agenda related to the coverage of the poor under SHI and the definition and management&#13;
of benefits.&#13;

&amp;#12;2. Health Coverage for the Poor in Chile: A Historic Overview&#13;
&#13;
Chile has a long-recognized history of running welfare programs, including health ones, focused&#13;
on the poor, vulnerable, and unemployed. Between the 16th and the 19th centuries, there&#13;
emerged several formal, nonprofit health care organizations, both public and private. In 1886, the&#13;
Statute of the Welfare Board (Junta de Beneficencia) was enacted to unify local health care&#13;
organizations and hospitals. In 1917, social welfare agencies participated in a national congress&#13;
that sought to improve the organization of the health system. In 1924, the Ministry of Hygiene,&#13;
Assistance and Social Welfare and the Mandatory Workerâ&#128;&#153;s Insurance were created to cover the&#13;
risks associated with illness, disability, old age, and death. The National Employees Services&#13;
(Sermena) was established in 1942 to provide health coverage to formal sector employees. The&#13;
National Health Service, created in 1952, unified several public health care providers, reaching&#13;
significant territorial coverage and serving mainly workers and the indigent. A reform adopted in&#13;
1981 created the National Health Fund (Fonasa), a large public insurer that superseded Sermena,&#13;
with financing coming from a 4 percent mandatory payroll health tax and public subsidies. Its&#13;
mandate was to cover the formally employed and the indigent. The law also made it possible for&#13;
private insurers to participate in the SHI market by collecting the 4 percent health tax plus&#13;
additional voluntary contributions. 5&#13;

Chileans outside of SHI are not subject to          the AUGE law. The majority of those without any&#13;
insurance are nonpoor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5&#13;
  In subsequent years this 4 percent was deemed insufficient to finance health benefits. It was therefore increased&#13;
progressively to reach its current value of 7 percent.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                       2&#13;
&amp;#12;As of December 2011, private commercial insurers (not shown in the figure) had about 4.6&#13;
million beneficiaries, surpassing coverage by Isapres. While there are no studies about the profile&#13;
of individuals with private commercial insurance, it is presumed that the majority are middle- and&#13;
upper-income individuals covered by an Isapre who seek further financial protection through&#13;
private insurance. The Chilean Association of Health Insurers (AACh 2012) estimates that 87&#13;
percent of the health premiums collected by its members come from firms that purchase&#13;
collective health coverage for their employees and families, while the remaining 13 percent&#13;
comes from premiums paid by individuals. These insurers provide either catastrophic health&#13;
coverage or offer additional financial coverage over and above that conferred by Fonasa and the&#13;
Isapres. They also cover individuals who are outside of the SHI system.&#13;
&#13;
By law, all dependent and independent workers with a retirement fund must enroll with Fonasa or&#13;
an Isapre by making a monthly contribution equal to 7 percent of their salary, up to a monthly&#13;
salary ceiling of US$2,700 (see Table 1). 6 Other individuals may join SHI as well. They include&#13;
independent workers, who can voluntarily enroll with Fonasa or an Isapre conditional on their 7&#13;
percent contribution; legally certified indigent citizens; legally unemployed workers, who are&#13;
entitled to free coverage by Fonasa; and retired individuals who, starting in 2010, were exempted&#13;
from the 7 percent contribution in Fonasa. In addition, Isapre beneficiaries may voluntarily make&#13;
an extra contribution to purchase supplementary coverage. Fonasa beneficiaries, instead, cannot&#13;
make such an additional, voluntary contribution beyond their legal 7 percent. Since the advent of&#13;
AUGE (see description in section 6), Isapres now also charge an AUGE premium beside the 7&#13;
percent legal premium and the additional voluntary contributions made by the insured. In&#13;
contrast, Fonasa does not charge an AUGE-specific premium beyond the 7 percent payroll tax.&#13;
&#13;
The public and private insurers that belong to SHI (Fonasa and the Isapres) operate in&#13;
competition and are regulated by the Health Regulatory Agency (Spanish is Superintendencia de&#13;
Salud), established in 2005. Private commercial insurers, instead, are regulated by the Securities&#13;
and Insurance Regulatory Agency (Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros). That SHI and non-&#13;
SHI insurers are subject to different regulatory frameworks is a matter of growing concern among&#13;
some law makers, who fear that this asymmetric regulation may not permit appropriate solutions&#13;
to market failures and equity problems that arise in health insurance markets.&#13;
&#13;
4. Coverage for the Poor under SHI&#13;
&#13;
Coverage for the poor is guaranteed through Fonasa. About 36 percent of Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s 13.2 million&#13;
beneficiaries are classified as indigent (also known as Group A; see figure 1), and to qualify they&#13;
must be certified as such through an official targeting process (described below). They can claim&#13;
full health coverage from Fonasa at no cost; they do not have to pay a premium for enrolment and&#13;
they are exempt for all copayments to public providers. The remaining 64 percent of Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
beneficiaries are formal or informal sector workers who contribute 7 percent of their salary to the&#13;
insurer, up to the monthly salary ceiling. They are classified into groups (B, C, and D) according&#13;
to their monthly income. Periodically Fonasa revises the income brackets that define these&#13;
groups, using the consumer price index.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
    The maximum legal monthly contribution to Fonasa or an Isapre is therefore US$140.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 3&#13;
&amp;#12;5. SHI Benefits&#13;
&#13;
In Fonasa, the health benefits of SHI for groups B, C, and D, and the retired, include the&#13;
following: (a) all AUGE health care services, both preventive and curative, mostly from public&#13;
providers, but also from private ones when the public supply of such services is not available; (b)&#13;
all non-AUGE health care services, also including preventive and curative care with public&#13;
providers; (c) a voucher to cofinance health care from private health care providers selected by&#13;
the beneficiary from a list of preferred providers maintained by Fonasa; and (d) sick and&#13;
maternity leave subsidies, which are payments made by Fonasa to the insured worker to replace&#13;
his or her income while away from work due to illness or childbirth. This income subsidy has a&#13;
ceiling equal to about US$2,700 per month. Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s indigent population currently can obtain&#13;
benefits (a) and (b), but not (c) and (d), although a recent proposal by Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s management is to&#13;
also grant them benefit (c).&#13;
&#13;
Isapres offer similar services except that the AUGE and non-AUGE health services are all&#13;
predominantly delivered by private providers. The almost exclusive use of private providers by&#13;
Isapre beneficiaries is due to two reasons. First, by law, public hospitals have stringent limits on&#13;
the number of hospital beds they can make available to non-Fonasa beneficiaries; and second,&#13;
Isapre beneficiaries seldom want to use public providers, because through their regular coverage&#13;
they can obtain better-quality and more timely care.&#13;
&#13;
Until 2005, Fonasa did not have an explicit benefits package and there was rationing of health&#13;
services for its beneficiaries through queues, denial of care, and low-quality services, particularly&#13;
for specialty care and for expensive hospital services. In addition, Chileâ&#128;&#153;s SHI system did not&#13;
have a legally defined benefits package, and therefore different Isapres could offer different&#13;
health plans, without a minimum or reference plan, and each Isapre could offer multiple health&#13;
plans. The lack of a national benefits package for SHI beneficiaries was seen by many as a&#13;
weakness of the system, which allowed for differences in coverage between Fonasa and the&#13;
Isapres and for risk selection and limited risk pooling in the Isapres.&#13;
&#13;
Table 1 summarizes the information presented above regarding the coverage, contributions,&#13;
benefits, and providers of health services in the country. The remainder of this document focuses&#13;
on the adoption of the AUGE benefits package and some of its consequences on access to&#13;
services and health spending by Fonasa beneficiaries.&#13;

6. The AUGE Health Reform of 2005&#13;
&#13;
In 2005, the reform known as AUGE or GES (Law No. 19.966) formulated an explicit benefits&#13;
package for all Fonasa and Isapre beneficiaries. The AUGE package set out to initially cover 56&#13;
priority health problems and explicitly defined four legal guarantees for beneficiaries, including:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Their right to health care for the priority problems&#13;
    â&#128;¢   The definition of treatment protocols and the explicit definition of the interventions to be&#13;
        guaranteed under the law for each health problem&#13;
    â&#128;¢   The adoption of maximum waiting times for health treatment&#13;
    â&#128;¢   The adoption of limits on out-of-pocket spending (OOPS) for health care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 5&#13;
&amp;#12;The AUGE guarantees apply to both Fonasa and Isapre beneficiaries. The significance of this&#13;
reform stems in part from its definition of explicit and legal health rights for Fonasa beneficiaries,&#13;
including the poor and the nonpoor. Its significance also results from the legal obligation for&#13;
Isapres to adoptâ&#128;&#148;at a minimumâ&#128;&#148;the exact same legal guarantees as Fonasa. Although Isapres&#13;
have had from their very beginnings explicit and legally regulated health contracts with their&#13;
beneficiaries, and a large share of beneficiaries obtained more coverage than what AUGE&#13;
requires, the advent of AUGE has also defined minimum benefits for these insurers. Thus, no&#13;
Isapre beneficiary can get less coverage than what AUGE requires. AUGE has therefore set up a&#13;
coverage floor, or standard, that all SHI insurers must abide by. By mid-2007, 56 AUGE priority&#13;
health problems, with their respective guarantees, were in place; they increased to 69 by mid-&#13;
2010 (see list in Annex B); currently a study is underway to determine whether 11 additional&#13;
priority health problems should be added, for a total of 80.&#13;
&#13;
Contents of AUGE. In the early 2000s, President Ricardo Lagos established an interministerial&#13;
health reform commission that conceived the AUGE policy and managed the process leading to&#13;
the formulation of the first 56 AUGE priority health problems. The Ministry of Health (MOH)&#13;
and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) determine the contents of the AUGE benefits package, taking&#13;
into account several criteria, including the burden of disease, the share of the population suffering&#13;
from the disease, the expected cost per beneficiary, the supply capacity of the health network, and&#13;
the effectiveness of the interventions. Vargas and Poblete (2008) discuss the prioritization criteria&#13;
used by the reform commission. Once a decision is made about any potential additions to or&#13;
subtractions from the AUGE package, the law requires that a costing study be carried out to&#13;
assess the consequences of any such changes on the cost of AUGE for Fonasa and the Isapres. If&#13;
the new cost is within the legally defined bound given by the so-called â&#128;&#156;universal premium,â&#128;?&#13;
whose amount is currently set by law at US$177 per beneficiary of SHI per year, then the MOH&#13;
issues a decree specifying the revised benefits package.&#13;
&#13;
Financing of AUGE. In 2005, the congress approved a law whereby the main source of public&#13;
financing for AUGE benefits in Fonasa would be a 1 percentage point increase in the value-added&#13;
tax, which increased from 18 percent to 19 percent. Whereas some studies have demonstrated that&#13;
Chileâ&#128;&#153;s value-added tax is regressive in its incidence, others have shown that it is progressive in&#13;
the benefits it finances (Engel, Galetovic, and Raddatz 1997). While no specific studies are&#13;
available, it is likely that this tax increase is progressive in the financing of AUGE benefits in&#13;
Fonasa.&#13;
&#13;
Providers. Fonasa purchases AUGE benefits mostly from public providers in all three levels of&#13;
care (see a description of Chileâ&#128;&#153;s health care delivery system in Annex A). This is in accordance&#13;
with an explicit policy adopted by Fonasa to minimize spending on AUGE by obtaining the&#13;
highest possible share of services from the relatively less expensive public providers. However, in&#13;
those situations where there is insufficient public supply, Fonasa may be forced to purchase&#13;
AUGE services from a private provider at a higher price. In 2010, Fonasa responded to rising&#13;
waiting lines for AUGE services with a new policy known as the AUGE voucher, which offers&#13;
beneficiaries a nominal voucher to obtain AUGE services from private providers when such&#13;
services are not available among local public providers. However, limited evidence shows that&#13;
use of the voucher has been modest because the voucherâ&#128;&#153;s value is too small to be attractive to&#13;
private providers. At the end of 2011, Fonasa claimed that all AUGE waiting lines had been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    6&#13;
&amp;#12;resolved, a claim that has been contested by many and that remains a subject of policy&#13;
controversy.&#13;
&#13;
Compliance monitoring. The National Health Regulator (Superintendencia de Salud) has the&#13;
responsibility to monitor compliance by Fonasa and the Isapres with the AUGE guarantees and to&#13;
sanction those insurers that fail to meet one or more guarantees. It is also responsible for&#13;
accrediting public and private health care providers engaged in the provision of AUGE services.&#13;
&#13;
Copayments for AUGE. The reform permits the adoption of copayments by Fonasa and the&#13;
Isapres for AUGE services. But to prevent impoverishment and large financing shocks from&#13;
health events, it sets a limit on the magnitude of these copayments. In Fonasa the indigent and&#13;
low-income beneficiaries in Group B are exempt from copayments. Beneficiaries in groups C and&#13;
D, instead, must make a maximum copayment of 10 and 20 percent, respectively, computed on&#13;
the basis of Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s price list. In addition, the sum of all copayments over any 12-month period&#13;
cannot exceed two monthly salaries, if the family has an AUGE health problem, and three&#13;
monthly salaries, if the family it has two or more AUGE health problems. Once this deductible is&#13;
reached, Fonasa and the Isapres fully cover the cost of any additional AUGE services, thus&#13;
exempting families from any additional copayments until the annual period is complete.&#13;
&#13;
Referral system. Fonasa beneficiaries, both the indigent and the rest, wishing to obtain care for an&#13;
AUGE medical problem, must first obtain health care from a primary health care doctor as the&#13;
entryway into AUGE. The doctor will make any necessary referrals to higher levels of the&#13;
delivery system in accordance with AUGE protocols. Beneficiaries can request confirmation of&#13;
their AUGE diagnosis via medical exams, as stated in the law. Isapre beneficiaries wishing to&#13;
obtain AUGE benefits must obtain a certificate from their physician stating that they have an&#13;
AUGE medical problem. They must then present this certificate to their Isapre, and this insurer&#13;
directs the patient to the preferred providers from its network for appropriate treatment. If the&#13;
beneficiary refuses to go to these providers, then he or she may opt out of AUGE by freely&#13;
selecting a different provider, thus getting the standard coverage (copayments, deductibles, and&#13;
ceilings) of its health plan. In case of vital emergencies, both Fonasa and Isapre beneficiaries may&#13;
obtain care at the closest facility, whether public or private, and must promptly inform their&#13;
insurer, who will later transfer the stabilized patient to a facility from its preferred provider&#13;
network. The MOH (2009) has shown evidence that the majority of Fonasa beneficiaries choose&#13;
to obtain AUGE services with Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s designated preferred providers, most of which are public,&#13;
and that most Isapre beneficiaries tend to opt out of AUGE, to get what they consider is better&#13;
care from the non-AUGE providers, with standard Isapre coverage.&#13;
&#13;
Payment for AUGE services. Fonasa pays public hospitals with a combination of prospective&#13;
payment per case and fee-for-service (FFS). It pays health centers via a combination of&#13;
capitation, FFS, and annual payment per case treated (for example, for the ambulatory&#13;
management of chronic conditions). Isapres pay private providers for AUGE health services&#13;
mostly on an FFS basis for ambulatory care and through a combination of payment per case and&#13;
FFS for hospital care.&#13;
&#13;
Information to consumers. The government has disseminated the mechanics of AUGE through&#13;
mass communication campaigns. Since the inception of AUGE in 2005, Chileans have been&#13;
becoming familiarized with their health rights under AUGE, and their growing utilization of&#13;
                                                                                                  7&#13;
&amp;#12;AUGE services attests to this. Medical doctors in both the public and private sectors have the&#13;
legal obligation to inform their patients in a written statement when their health problem has&#13;
some AUGE coverage.&#13;
&#13;
7. Financing and Service Flows in SHI&#13;
&#13;
This document has described the structure and agents of Chileâ&#128;&#153;s SHI system, its financing&#13;
sources, and health benefits. It now provides a description of the financing flows, structure, and&#13;
amounts.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 2 presents the funding and health service flows in Chileâ&#128;&#153;s current SHI system.&#13;
Government subsidies to Fonasa are intended to fully finance coverage for the indigent and the&#13;
retired. Fonasa also receives the 7 percent contributions made by its members. It pays public&#13;
providers through a combination of historic budgets (hospitals), capitation (health centers), fee-&#13;
for-service (FFS), and case-based payment. It pays private providers FFS and case-based&#13;
payment. Isapres get financing exclusively from the 7 percent mandatory contributions of their&#13;
members, the additional mandatory AUGE premium (Isapres have the right to charge it and&#13;
freedom to set it), and additional, voluntary premiums that the insured pay to obtain better&#13;
plansâ&#128;&#148;ones with smaller copayments, deductibles, and ceilings; greater provider choice; or&#13;
better-quality providers. Isapres pay private providers mostly FFS. By law, Isapres are not&#13;
allowed to own health providers, so that vertical integration is not possible. Yet, the largest&#13;
Isapres are owned by business consortiums that also own health care providers.&#13;

&amp;#12;Figure 3 shows the flow of funds in Chileâ&#128;&#153;s health system. It comprises sources of funding,&#13;
agents that manage these funds, and service providers. The system receives funding from the&#13;
central government, municipalities, workers, and households. Household financing includes both&#13;
OOPS (37.2 percent) and additional voluntary contributions to Isapres (6.5 percent), and&#13;
represents the largest funding source, totaling 43.8 percent of resources. It is followed in&#13;
importance by funding from the central government (29.3 percent) and the 7 percent mandatory&#13;
contribution of workers to SHI (26.0 percent).&#13;
&#13;
Resources are transferred to the agents, which concentrate and allocate system revenue. The&#13;
agents are Fonasa, the Isapres, the MOH, and private insurers. The agent that channels the&#13;
greatest proportion of resources is Fonasa (39.9 percent), which receives resources from the&#13;
central government and mandatory premiums of workers. The second most important are the&#13;
Isapres, with a 16.5 percent share coming from mandatory 7 percent contributions and additional&#13;
voluntary contributions of members.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, these agents channel their financial resources to public and private providers using&#13;
different payment methods. Private providers capture 59.5 percent of all system resources while&#13;
public providers capture the remainder.&#13;

The following analysis of national health     Figure 5 Total and Government Health Expenditure,&#13;
spending uses data reported by Fonasa                            2000â&#128;&#147;11 (%)&#13;
(2012) for 2000â&#128;&#147;11. The figures&#13;
presented are estimates. Total health&#13;
expenditure (THE) has fallen as a share&#13;
of gross domestic product (GDP) from&#13;
8.4 percent in 2000 to 7.3 percent in&#13;
2011. This drop occurred at the same&#13;
time that the share of the health sector in&#13;
the government budget grew from 12.2&#13;
percent in 2000 to 13.9 percent in 2011.&#13;
In absolute, real terms, THE per capita&#13;
has grown by 48 percent (figure 6), from&#13;
Ch$266,000 to Ch$395,000 (Chilean&#13;
pesos of December 2011).&#13;

&amp;#12;8. Targeting, Identification, and Enrolment of Beneficiaries in Fonasa&#13;
&#13;
By definition, Fonasa Group A beneficiaries are individuals who lack resources or formal&#13;
employment, and those who receive a Unique Family Subsidy (Subsidio Ã&#154;nico Familiar) or a&#13;
Government-subsidized Pension and Disability Subsidy (PensiÃ³n BÃ¡sica Solidaria, PBS).&#13;
Likewise, pregnant women, and children under six years of age, can apply to become Group A&#13;
beneficiaries and obtain free health care from all providers in the public network. Application for&#13;
Group A status takes place in public health centers where the individual must be registered. A&#13;
special application form known as Accreditation of Indigence (ClasificaciÃ³n de Carencia de&#13;
Recursos) must be available for this purpose in all these facilities around the country.&#13;
&#13;
Fonasa Group A beneficiaries represent over one-fourth of Chileâ&#128;&#153;s total population (see table 1),&#13;
yet poverty in Chile is only 14.4 percent (UNDP 2012). The distance between these two figures&#13;
led Fonasa authorities in 2010 to inquire about the existence of the so-called â&#128;&#156;false indigents.â&#128;?&#13;
The inquiry involved first an analysis of the 2009 national Socioeconomic Characterization&#13;
Survey (Encuesta de CaracterizaciÃ³n SocioeconÃ³mica, CASEN), followed by cross-checking of&#13;
the Fonasa beneficiary roster with those of the Internal Tax Service (Servicio de Impuestos&#13;
Internos). The result of this effort was that approximately 400,000 individuals were found to be&#13;
illegally enrolled in Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s Group A. Most of them were temporary workers and independent&#13;
workers who did not make any pension contributions. Contributing to the pension system is a&#13;
legal requirement for all Chilean workers, except if they are considered indigent. This confers a&#13;
perverse incentive for some who choose to qualify as indigent, thus relieving themselves of the&#13;
burden of having to put income away in the form of a pension contribution.&#13;
&#13;
In reaction to this information, Fonasa announced in July 2012 that the majority of Group A&#13;
beneficiaries who declared to be temporary workers would be reclassified as Group B&#13;
beneficiaries and, thus, required to contribute 7 percent of their income to Fonasa. Independent&#13;
workers with regular income will be required to join an Isapre.&#13;
&#13;
Fonasa estimates that its efforts over the last two years to improve the reliability of the&#13;
classification of its beneficiaries has enabled the public insurer to save about US$600 million in&#13;
two years. This is a significant figure, since it represents about 10 percent of Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s annual&#13;
budget. Fonasa will use the savings from these targeting measures to grant about 660,000 Group&#13;
A beneficiaries, who currently are in that group because they receive a PBS, to join Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
voucher system for its preferred provider network with private sector providers.&#13;
&#13;
9. Management and Public Funding of the AUGE Benefit&#13;
&#13;
As noted, the AUGE law states that AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s average cost per beneficiary should not be&#13;
significantly different from the so-called â&#128;&#156;universal premium.â&#128;? Since 2005, the MOH has&#13;
commissioned several studies to estimate the cost of AUGE. Results from these studies have fed&#13;
into the joint decision by the MOH and the MOF to expand the AUGE guarantees. Participation&#13;
by the MOF in the studiesâ&#128;&#153; committees reflects the finance authorityâ&#128;&#153;s concern with the fiscal&#13;
implications of AUGE. Four such costing studies have been conducted since the implementation&#13;
of the reform in 2005 and a fifth is underway. That year, the first 56 guaranteed health problems&#13;
were included in the benefits package. In 2010, an additional 13 priority problems were added,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                12&#13;
&amp;#12;for a total of 69. Currently, an ongoing study will help determine whether an additional 11&#13;
guaranteed health problems should be added.&#13;
&#13;
Until 2010, the MOH costing Figure 8 Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s Estimated Cost per Beneficiary for AUGE&#13;
studies of AUGE did not compute          and Non-AUGE Services, 2001â&#128;&#147;09 (US$ of June 2009)&#13;
the incremental cost of AUGE, but       350&#13;
instead calculated the total cost of                  Pre-AUGE period                   Post-AUGE period&#13;

an impact on public finances. A                          AUGE services    Non-AUGE services&#13;
&#13;
study commissioned by the MOH Source: Author using MOH 2012 data.&#13;
(2012) set out to estimate that&#13;
incremental cost. The main study&#13;
findings are summarized in figure 8. Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s total spending per beneficiary, expressed in current&#13;
U.S. dollars, has grown significantly since 2005. AUGE spending was US$116 in 2005 and&#13;
increased to US$157 in 2009â&#128;&#148;a 35 percent increase. Non-AUGE spending by Fonasa also&#13;
increased, and by an even greater percentage (36 percent), over the same period.&#13;
&#13;
It seems ironic that guaranteed health services in the AUGE benefits package would bring about a&#13;
per capita increase in Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s spending about equal, in percentage terms, to the increase in&#13;
spending on nonguaranteed health services. The explanation probably lies in the following&#13;
phenomenon: When the AUGE guarantees were adopted in 2005, Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s population was not&#13;
familiar with a culture of guaranteed health care. Beneficiaries would get the services they could&#13;
and waited for weeks or months for the needed services that were unavailable due to supply&#13;
constraints in the public health care delivery system. Progressively, Fonasa beneficiaries&#13;
understood their new rights and began to exert them, demanding a growing amount of AUGE&#13;
services (see below). But at the same time, they also started to demand that non-AUGE services&#13;
also be provided to them with equal promptitude.&#13;
&#13;
The political noise that waiting lists for non-AUGE services caused led the previous and the&#13;
current governments to increase Fonasa spending on non-AUGE services, as well. The above&#13;
figures attest to this phenomenon. Yet, while there seem to be few instances of noncompliance&#13;
with AUGE guarantees by Fonasa, it is publicly known that there are long waiting lines for non-&#13;
AUGE services. Fonasa and the MOH have expressed their willingness to reduce these lines, but&#13;
have also declared that their ability to do so will be limited by the availability of public financing&#13;
and a shortage of medical services in the public sector, particularly medical specialists. The&#13;
reduction in waiting lines for AUGE services is partly the result of the â&#128;&#156;AUGE voucherâ&#128;? policy,&#13;
already described in this document.&#13;
                                                                                                                    13&#13;
&amp;#12;10. Impact of AUGE&#13;
&#13;
In late 2009, the Ministry of Health (2009) released to the press results from one of its first&#13;
evaluations of AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s health impact (not including any of the chronic conditions selected for&#13;
this research). It found that mortality from several types of cancer (testicular, gall bladder, and&#13;
breast cancers) dropped from 125.8 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2005, before AUGE, to 114.5 in&#13;
2007, two years into the reform.&#13;
&#13;
Drawing on information from various sources, Bitran et al. (2010) assessed the impact of AUGE&#13;
on access to care, treatment outcomes, hospitalization rates, and medical leave rates for six&#13;
chronic diseases. They found that for some of those diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes type&#13;
1 and 2, and depression, the reform was linked to growing access to services and increased&#13;
coverage. For those diseases and for child epilepsy and HIV/AIDS, the hospital case fatality rate&#13;
dropped.&#13;
&#13;
A study by Valdivieso and Montero (2010) assessed AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s performance from the perspective&#13;
of accessibility to guaranteed services. They found that AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s access guarantee has been&#13;
successful overall, and a powerful instrument to improve equity in health. About 95 percent of all&#13;
Fonasa beneficiaries and three-fourths of those who belong to Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s poorest groups (groups A&#13;
and B) have experienced improved access to care with the reform. Patients under 15 years of age&#13;
and those over 60 years of age are particularly favored. They also found that the waiting time&#13;
guarantee has generally been met, although for some diseases there are noticeable delays,&#13;
including for cataracts, correction of both refractive defects and bilateral hearing loss in adults,&#13;
preventive cholecystectomy of vesicular cancer, and the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia.&#13;
Overall, in the first five years of implementation of the reform in the public sector, there is a&#13;
record of more than 10 million guaranteed health services provided to Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s insured, with only&#13;
about 150,000 delayed services, equivalent to 1.5 percent of total demand.&#13;
&#13;
Valdivieso and Montero (2010) also examined Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s compliance with the quality guarantees&#13;
of AUGE, and found that quality assurance has not yet become effective, partly because the&#13;
processes of accreditation and certification of health care providers is not yet completed. Public&#13;
providers may need several more years to meet accreditation standards, since significant&#13;
additional investments in infrastructure, equipment, and human resources are required to do so. In&#13;
addition, the delivery of guaranteed medicines has been irregular for several AUGE health&#13;
problems. In contrast, Valdivieso and Montero concluded that the financial protection guarantee&#13;
has worked well in Fonasa and constitutes a significant step forward for achieving equity in&#13;
access to care, particularly for the poorest members of society. In the Isapre system, they found&#13;
management problems have limited access of beneficiaries to some AUGE guarantees, a reason&#13;
that would partly account for the still low levels of AUGE use by this group.&#13;
&#13;
Only 5 percent of the 10 million AUGE services delivered to date have benefited Isapre&#13;
beneficiaries, even though that population group represents 18 percent of all SHI beneficiaries. It&#13;
is expected that as the Isapre population becomes more acquainted with AUGE and as the costs&#13;
of health care continue to rise, they will increasingly turn toward AUGE to contain both their&#13;
Isapre premium and their OOPS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 14&#13;
&amp;#12;Figure 9 illustrates different patterns of health service utilization for four selected AUGE health&#13;
problems from the above-mentioned study by the MOH (2012). The problems are breast cancer&#13;
(panel A), scoliosis (panel B), HIV/AIDS (panel C), and cholecystectomy (panel D). Since the&#13;
implementation of AUGE in 2005, the number of breast reconstruction surgeries has tripled in&#13;
response to growing demand by beneficiaries. The number of biopsies did not change&#13;
immediately after the implementation of AUGE, but nearly doubled in 2009 relative to the&#13;
amount in the year of implementation. The number of surgeries to correct scoliosis has more than&#13;
tripled since the advent of AUGE. Total lymphocytes count (OKT3 and OKT11) and&#13;
immunophenotyping exams for HIV/AIDS patients increased well before AUGE, and have&#13;
fluctuated thereafter. The annual number of HIV/AIDS patients discharged from public hospitals&#13;
has remained rather constant. 7 The number of cholecystectomies with or without surgical&#13;
cholangiography has remained more or less stable whereas the number of laparoscopic&#13;
cholangiographies has increased by a factor of four. Overall, the MOH (2012) found significant&#13;
evidence that AUGE has expanded beneficiary access to health care for guaranteed health&#13;
treatments. No data are available, however, to permit this analysis by the Fonasa group.&#13;
&#13;
Paraje and VÃ¡squez (2012) used data from Fonasa and from a national household survey to&#13;
examine trends in the utilization of health services after the implementation of AUGE. They&#13;
found that specialized care, lab tests, X-rays, and ultrasounds have had, since 2003, strong pro-&#13;
rich distributions, but that in all cases this decreased between 2003 and 2009. Visits to general&#13;
practitioners went from a moderately pro-poor concentration index to moderately pro-rich over&#13;
the same period. By contrast, emergency care and inpatient days have concentration indexes&#13;
showing a pro-poor distribution, which is relatively stable over time.&#13;
&#13;
The overall assessment of AUGE by the general population, as measured with opinion polls by an&#13;
independent firm contracted out by the National Health Regulator is positive. About 80 percent of&#13;
respondents evaluated the AUGE system with a grade of 85 to 100, where the latter is the&#13;
maximum.&#13;
&#13;
The consequences of AUGE for health system efficiency have not been measured. There are,&#13;
however, elements in AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s design and mechanics that suggest that allocative efficiency may&#13;
have improved as a result of the selection of cost-effective treatments in AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s benefits&#13;
package. In addition, productive efficiency may also have improved through the adoption of&#13;
explicit treatment protocols for all of AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s interventions. Further, AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s approach to&#13;
disease management, which considers explicit criteria for medical referrals and counterreferrals&#13;
along different levels of the delivery system, may also contribute to improved allocative and&#13;
productive efficiency. Currently, Fonasa is considering mandating the use of around 100 generic,&#13;
bioequivalent drugs for the treatment of AUGE diseases.&#13;

11. The Health Coverage for the Poor Information Environment&#13;
&#13;
In anticipation of the AUGE reform, Fonasa developed an information system, the Reporting&#13;
System for the Management of Explicit Health Guarantees (Sistema de InformaciÃ³n para la&#13;
GestiÃ³n de GarantÃ­as en Salud, SIGGES). It was intended to capture the most significant&#13;
utilization statistics for guaranteed health services and also information about the stages of each&#13;
priority disease, from suspected cases to diagnostic confirmation to treatment and control.&#13;
SIGGES was initially faulty because the system that Fonasa sought to develop was overly&#13;
ambitious, but Fonasa officials claim that, over the years, SIGGES has become more accurate.&#13;
SIGGES, however, was not specifically designed for Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s indigent, but was designed to&#13;
record information equally for all Fonasa beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
The National Health Regulator has two main functions: (a) to ensure that social health insurers&#13;
(Fonasa and the Isapres) comply with the SHI law; and (b) to accredit, certify, and perform&#13;
quality assurance of public and private health care providers around the country. With regard to&#13;
(a), the agency keeps track of all complaints made by Fonasa and Isapre beneficiaries regarding&#13;
failure by the insurer to comply with the AUGE and guarantees and with all other, non-AUGE&#13;
legal benefits. The regulator follows up on all complaints, although its ability to follow up with&#13;
                                                                                                 16&#13;
&amp;#12;Fonasa has encountered legal problems. As regards (b), the regulator must accredit all public and&#13;
private health care providers that wish to provide AUGE services. The regulator is far behind in&#13;
its second function, primarily because vast amounts of public investments are necessary to bring&#13;
public hospitals to a level where they may be accredited. The government seems to want to phase&#13;
out these investments in order to spread the fiscal impact of these investments over time. Thus, it&#13;
may take several years for all public hospitals, to be accredited as AUGE providers.&#13;
&#13;
12. Equity and Fiscal Implications of Expanding the AUGE Benefits&#13;
&#13;
While the overall assessment of the AUGE reform is positive, as argued above, there is a&#13;
challenge ahead that may complicate the policy scenario. Its origin is in the Isapre system. Isapres&#13;
have been criticized for cream skimmingâ&#128;&#148;selectively deciding who they cover and who they&#13;
reject. They have also been accused of price discriminationâ&#128;&#148;setting their premium in accordance&#13;
with each individualâ&#128;&#153;s or family groupâ&#128;&#153;s riskâ&#128;&#148;thus defeating the principle of solidarity. 8 Those&#13;
in their situation are called Isapre â&#128;&#156;captives.â&#128;? Isapres have also successfully been challenged in&#13;
the Constitutional Tribunal for increasing their prices with a personâ&#128;&#153;s age in a way that, according&#13;
to constitutional experts, violates the constitution. Thus, in 2011 the Constitutional Tribunal&#13;
ordered Isapres to stop increasing their premiums with the insuredâ&#128;&#153;s age.&#13;
&#13;
All these factors have led lawmakers to propose a legal change that would force all Isapres to&#13;
offer the same benefits package, known as Guaranteed Health Plan (GHP), while allowing them&#13;
to sell complementary insurance above the GHP. It turns out that the contents of the GHP would&#13;
largely exceed the contents of AUGE. In fact, the GHP would contain AUGE, plus catastrophic&#13;
coverage, plus coverage for preventive care, plus coverage for all non-AUGE services. The&#13;
AUGE-like guarantees would apply only to the AUGE component of the GHP. Other coverage&#13;
would have less stringent conditions for the insurer. A proposal to adopt the GHP policy is&#13;
currently pending approval in congress. Some think tanks and trade groups, as well as the&#13;
government, have estimated that if the GHP law were approved, as many as one-third of Isapre&#13;
beneficiaries would leave the Isapre system to join Fonasa. The reason for this expected exodus is&#13;
that to be able to offer the GHP, Isapres would have to raise their premium considerably, and this&#13;
would result in a drop in the demand for coverage from these insurers.&#13;
&#13;
In the debate, some policy makers have argued that it would be unfair for Isapres to have a legal&#13;
benefits package much broader than Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s. They have, therefore, proposed that the GHP&#13;
should be extended to Fonasa, as well.&#13;
&#13;
The fiscal implications of AUGE are unclear but seem moderate to date. Although government&#13;
spending on AUGE and non-AUGE services has increased in real per capita terms, government&#13;
health spending as a share of total government spending has been increasing mildly since&#13;
AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s adoption, from around 13 percent to about 14 percent. The future fiscal impact of&#13;
AUGE will depend on the degree to which AUGE guarantees are expanded. Yet, an orthodox&#13;
policy by the MOF has set a limit on the cost of AUGE, by defining an upper limit, in real terms,&#13;
for the actuarial cost of AUGE per beneficiary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
    See differences in age and sex profiles between Fonasa and Isapre beneficiaries in figure AB.1 of Annex B.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 17&#13;
&amp;#12;The impact of AUGE on OOPS appears to have been positive if the National Health Account data&#13;
reported by Fonasa are correct. The only national household study of health service utilization&#13;
and OOPS was conducted in 2007. A new study is needed to assess the consequences of AUGE&#13;
on OOPS and on access to health care by socioeconomic group.&#13;
&#13;
The logic of AUGE has been the progressive and explicit coverage of guaranteed health services.&#13;
To date, the evidence suggests that AUGE has been a positive reform. Key to its success is the&#13;
incremental nature of the guarantees: 25 priority problems were covered in 2005, 40 in 2006, 56&#13;
in 2007, 69 in 2010, and, possibly, 80 in 2013. Broadly expanding the benefits package in&#13;
Fonasa, from AUGE to GHP, would probably result in the breakup of the system of guarantees.&#13;
Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s limited resources would not be compatible with such a large benefits package. In the&#13;
end, if it were forced to guarantee all services, then probably guarantees would no longer be met&#13;
as systematically as they have been under AUGE.&#13;
&#13;
13. Pending Agenda&#13;
&#13;
Implementation of a reform as far reaching as AUGE has challenged most key actors in the health&#13;
system. Fonasa is still striving to meet some guarantees while having to live within its limited&#13;
budget. It also has to improve its main information system, SIGGES, to track AUGEâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
performance. The National Health Regulator must still gain full power to regulate Fonasa in&#13;
much the same way as it has been regulating the Isapres. It must make more progress in the&#13;
regulation of health care quality in the public and private sectors, an initiative that has turned out&#13;
to be much more difficult, costly, and hard to implement than it had originally envisioned.&#13;
Isapres, in turn, are experiencing an increase in the demand for AUGE benefits by their&#13;
beneficiaries and have been increasing the AUGE-specific premium year after year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   18&#13;
&amp;#12;                       Annex A The Market for Health Services in Chile&#13;
&#13;
The market for health care services in Chile is mixed. In 2005, there were 39,135 hospital beds in&#13;
the country of which 72 percent were public and 28 percent were private (PAHO 2007). In 2009,&#13;
the country had 2,464 public and private health care facilities, including 2,288 in the public sector&#13;
(known as the National Health Services System, SNSS) and 176 in the private sector. Among the&#13;
public sector facilities, 226 were hospitals and 2,062 were ambulatory health centers. All 176&#13;
private sector facilities are hospitals or clinics. A large but unknown number of private doctorâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
offices and ambulatory centers are not accounted for (INE 2011). The country has approximately&#13;
30,000 medical doctors, 44 percent of whom are employed in the public sector and 56 percent of&#13;
whom work exclusively in the private sector. A large but unknown share of the publicly&#13;
employed medical doctors also has a private practice (MOH 2012).&#13;
&#13;
The SNSS is a decentralized network of primary, secondary, and tertiary facilities managed and&#13;
technically supervised by 33 decentralized Regional Health Services (RHS). Each RHS manages&#13;
several secondary and tertiary facilities while primary health centers are managed by municipal&#13;
corporations. Primary care facilities offer preventive and curative health care and health&#13;
promotion on an ambulatory basis. There are 2,062 such facilities in the country, in both urban&#13;
and rural areas, including health centers, rural health posts, and rural-medical stations. These&#13;
facilities must comply with technical and ministerial norms of care prescribed by the Ministry of&#13;
Health (MOH) and must offer the services defined by it. Secondary care facilities may be stand&#13;
alone, such as Reference Health Centers and Diagnostic and Treatment Centers, or they may be&#13;
part of a public hospital. There are four types of public hospital according to the complexity of&#13;
the services they can treat.&#13;
&#13;
The referral system in the public sector has experienced problems over time, the result of a lack&#13;
of coordination between provider systems that are managed by different operators; municipalities&#13;
run primary health care facilities and Regional Health Services manage secondary and tertiary&#13;
level facilities. The AUGE reform (see description below) has helped improve referral patterns,&#13;
because the AUGE treatment guarantees define referral patterns that the health system must&#13;
comply with by law. For example, the treatment guarantee for diabetic patients involves initial&#13;
consultations with a specialist to confirm the diagnosis and to define the course of treatment,&#13;
followed by subsequent controls at the primary health care level, followed by occasional visits to&#13;
the specialists and, when necessary, by hospitalization.&#13;
&#13;
Since the 1981 reform, which split financing from provision in the public sector, Fonasa has not&#13;
owned or run any health facilities. Fonasa purchases health care services on behalf of its&#13;
beneficiaries in both the public and private sectors. In the public sector, it pays public hospitals&#13;
through a combination of historic budgets (50 percent), FFS, and prospective payment (the other&#13;
50 percent). It pays municipal health centers mostly a capitation but also FFS. In the private&#13;
sector, Fonasa pays ambulatory and inpatient providers on an FFS basis via a voucher system.&#13;
&#13;
Chile has a long-standing strategy to attract and retain doctors in rural areas. Known as the Rural&#13;
Practitioner Program, it was launched in 1955 with the main objective of attracting physicians to&#13;
work in rural primary care hospitals and health centers for a minimum of three and a maximum of&#13;
six years. The programâ&#128;&#153;s main incentive is a grant for the doctorâ&#128;&#153;s residency in a university&#13;
hospital plus attractive salaries and benefits that increase with the remoteness of the workplace&#13;
                                                                                                  19&#13;
&amp;#12;and the doctorâ&#128;&#153;s clinical responsibilities. The program considers both direct and indirect financial&#13;
incentives to retain doctors in rural areas. Still, there is a shortage of specialists in rural areas,&#13;
which is hampering Fonasaâ&#128;&#153;s ability to deliver AUGE and non-AUGE benefits there.&#13;
&#13;
In 2010, Chileâ&#128;&#153;s infant and child mortality rates, at 7.7 and 8.8 per 1,000 live births, respectively,&#13;
were among the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean, second only to Cubaâ&#128;&#153;s. Together&#13;
with a life expectancy at birth of 78.9 years, these indicators put Chile at nearly the same level as&#13;
industrialized countries. Yet, other indicators do not compare favorably with developing or&#13;
industrialized countries. These include a rapidly growing prevalence of diabetes, a high&#13;
prevalence of hypertension among adults, and the worldâ&#128;&#153;s highest prevalence of smoking among&#13;
female adolescents.&#13;
&#13;
Many of Chileâ&#128;&#153;s noteworthy health achievements are attributable to its publicly run primary care&#13;
system and to an institutional coverage of deliveries that reached over 99 percent more than three&#13;
decades ago. A nationwide network of rural health posts, standard health centers, family health&#13;
centers (CESFAM), and community family health centers are staffed with doctors, nurses,&#13;
midwives, laboratory technicians, and social workers. Their aim is to achieve high rates of&#13;
coverage of pre- and postnatal care, child growth monitoring, and child immunization, and to&#13;
deliver several other health services that are part of a primary level benefits package known as the&#13;
Family Health Plan (Plan de Salud Familiar).&#13;
&#13;
In addition to these facilities, the MOH operates emergency primary health care services, which&#13;
are facilities designed to solve low-complexity emergencies on an ambulatory basis, thus&#13;
improving the ability of the primary care system to resolve medical problems and relieving&#13;
hospitals, while reducing transportation and time costs for beneficiaries. Aside from their&#13;
engagement in maternal and child health, standard health centers have, for nearly 30 years,&#13;
operated managed care programs for diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic conditions. Until&#13;
1981, standard health centers were operated by the MOH. With the health reform of that year,&#13;
management of these facilities was transferred to municipalitiesâ&#128;&#153; health corporations, although&#13;
the MOH retains its role as the health authority for these facilities, defining standards of care and&#13;
services to be provided.&#13;
&#13;
To obtain services from the public primary health care network, individuals must formally&#13;
register with a health center. The registration list serves as the basis for the computation of the&#13;
capitation payment that Fonasa transfers to municipal corporations. The latter can top up per&#13;
capita revenue with own financing.&#13;
&#13;
By law, all Chileans have free access to public primary health care services, including individuals&#13;
who are not beneficiaries of Fonasa. Thus, Isapre beneficiaries could in principle obtain services&#13;
from these providers at no cost. Yet, their use is infrequent because beneficiaries prefer to obtain&#13;
ambulatory care from private providers, who are perceived as offering better-quality care and&#13;
whose fees are largely covered by their Isapre plan.&#13;

&amp;#12;The World Bank supports the efforts of countries to share prosperity by&#13;
transitioning toward universal health coverage (UHC) with the objectives of&#13;
improving health outcomes, reducing the financial risks associated with ill&#13;
health, and increasing equity. The Bank recognizes that there are many paths&#13;
toward UHC and does not endorse a particular path or set of organizational or&#13;
financial arrangements to reach it. Regardless of the path chosen, the quality of&#13;
the instruments and institutions countries establish to implement UHC are&#13;
essential to its success. Countries will face a variety of challenges during the&#13;
implementation phase as they strive to expand health coverage. With that in&#13;
mind, the World Bank launched the Universal Health Coverage Studies Series&#13;
(UNICO Studies Series) to develop knowledge and operational tools designed&#13;
to help countries tackle these implementation challenges in ways that are&#13;
fiscally sustainable and that enhance equity and efficiency. The UNICO Studies&#13;
Series consists of technical papers and country case studies that analyze&#13;
different issues related to the challenges of UHC policy implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The case studies in the series are based on the use of a standardized protocol&#13;
to analyze the nuts and bolts of 27 programs in 25 countries that have&#13;
expanded coverage from the bottom up, starting with the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
The protocol consists of 300 questions designed to elicit a detailed&#13;
understanding of how countries are implementing five sets of policies to&#13;
accomplish the following:&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢     Manage the benefits package&#13;
  â&#128;¢     Manage processes to include the poor and vulnerable&#13;
  â&#128;¢     Nudge efficiency reforms to the provision of care&#13;
  â&#128;¢     Address new challenges in primary care&#13;
  â&#128;¢     Tweak financing mechanisms to align the incentives of different&#13;
  stakeholders in the health sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The UNICO Studies Series aims to provide UHC implementers with an expanded toolbox.&#13;
The protocol, case studies and technical papers are being published as part of the Series. A&#13;
comparative analysis of the case studies will be available in 2013.&#13;

            insurers to adopt a broad benefits package defined via
            explicit legal guarantees for all beneficiaries. This
            innovative reform is a policy reaction to that which
            previously existed in Chile and which is widespread in many
            developing countries, whereby the health rights of citizens
            remain largely undefined or implicit. Limited public
            resources imply in those countries that access to health
            care is rationed through queues, patient deflection, legal
            or under-the-table user fees, and low-quality care. This
            paper describes the AUGE reform, its implementation, and the
            functioning of AUGE for the poor and for non-poor citizens.
            This paper is organized as: section two provides a brief
            historic overview of health coverage in Chile's SHI
            system. Section three describes the SHI system in existence
            today. Section four describes the services offered and
            mechanisms in place to cover the poor under SHI, while
            section five spells out the benefits of SHI. Section six
            introduces the AUGE health reform of 2005, which sought to
            broaden and make explicit the rights of all SHI
            beneficiaries. Section seven offers information about the
            flows and magnitudes of health financing in SHI. Section
            eight focuses on the system used by Fonasa to target the
            poor. Section nine explains how Fonasa manages AUGE. Section
            ten comments on the information environment of AUGE. Section
            eleven addresses the equity and fiscal implications of
            expanding the AUGE benefits. Finally, section twelve
            proposes a pending policy agenda related to the coverage of
            the poor under SHI and the definition and management of benefits.
