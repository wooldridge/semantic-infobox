This publication summarizes the findings of research carried out by the World Bank Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in 1 999, then&#13;
under the direction of Brian Grover and Bruce Gross, who provided both moral and financial support for our endeavors. The Field&#13;
research was carried out by consultants Carmen Arevalo, Luis Brusco, Fernando Troyano and Juan Nunura, all of whom contributed&#13;
with excellent reports, well beyond their terms of reference. Field research was partially financed by Danish Consultant Trust Funds, by&#13;
the GTZ and the WSP Special appreciation should be expressed for GTZ's support and collaboration which led to the production of two&#13;
videos on small scale water producers in Latin America.&#13;
Unfortunately it is not possible to list all of those who gave their time and shared their experiences and knowledge to our team.&#13;
However, of those who stand out in particular, we must acknowledge the support and enthusiasm of the Director of the Water Program&#13;
in the Colombian Planning Ministry. Luis Fernando Arboleda and his deputy, Luis Fernando Ulloa, now general manager of the water&#13;
companies of Barranquilla and Soledad respectively, Jorge Triana and Mauricio Lopez of ACODAL, and above all, of Fernando Araujo,&#13;
Minister of Development for Colombia who put in place a policy to develop small scale water producers Fernando, I regret to add, was&#13;
kidnapped in 2000 and is supposed dead. Among the "aguatero" community we must mention Silvio Melgarejo, President of CAPA in&#13;
Paraguay, Jorge Uribe, of CONHYDRA, Colombia; Chihala Ghassam, President of the Cooperative of el Carmen, Cochabamba, Bolivia,&#13;
a few of many whose work inspired a re-evaluation of the private water sector in Latin America&#13;
Among the many World Bank colleagues whose help and interest spurred us on we mention Chantal Reliquet, Maria Paniagua and&#13;
Katia Nemes participated in missions and meetings, Alex Bakalian, first put us in touch with the Aguateros of Paraguay, Menahem&#13;
Libhaber, whose contacts in Colombia were wonderfully helpful. Guillermo Yepes, Lee Travers, Omar Razzaz, and Vincent Gouarne&#13;
reviewed the various papers which resulted from the research Their comments are gratefully acknowledged. Vivien Foster, Mananne&#13;
Fay, Jonathan Halperin and Jack Stein gave the final push to publish, clearly worthy of a thankful mention.&#13;
Besides this, the publication would not have been possible without the WSP publications team in Lima, Peru, Beatnz Schippner, with help from&#13;
Jorge Serraino and Arlene Shaffer of the World Bank in Washington and consultant Suzanne Snell who found the right words for the text. Peter&#13;
Loach as team assistant kept us on track and organized throughout. To all, my sincere thanks and appreciation&#13;

and replacement of open entry and private ownership  that ensured the survival of such an independent&#13;

regulator. Faced with the possible loss of their jobs  ground water in the late 1 980s in an area of&#13;

Buying cover A second common survival tactic is&#13;
that of "buying cover." At its worst this implies outright  nas. The municipality's purchase paid off the initial&#13;
bribery. Independent operators are usually not in a  investment and the municipality makes up the&#13;
position to make hefty bribes to municipal utility  company's losses through budgetary transfers (the&#13;
officials or highly placed municipal officials. The  original owner also made money by selling real estate&#13;
operators who admitted to this particular risk-averting  in the area). Aguas Metropolitanas has few remaining&#13;

The results of the country surveys of independent water providers and of the February 1999 congress which&#13;
brought them together for the first time point towards a vision of a new kind of business environment for water&#13;
provision in Latin America, one which gives all providers incentives to improve the quality and coverage of&#13;
services while keeping prices competitive. In this kind of environment, government becomes an enabler rather&#13;
than an operator. The right balance between large and small companies, municipal utilities and independent&#13;
providers, is determined by customers and market forces, rather than by predetermined assignment of roles&#13;
and exclusive privileges. International donors and financers, national and local governments, and the independent&#13;
providers themselves are all stakeholders in this environment, and all have new roles to learn.&#13;
International donors, flnanciers, and developers could benefit from looking carefully at what the&#13;
independent providers are doing before undertaking major investments in the water sector. Where exclusivity is&#13;
assigned to concessions, this can spell the end of investment by the existing local private providers. Independent&#13;
providers could even be viewed as potential clients, rather than interlopers. Donors could speed the pace of&#13;
technological exchange by supporting the creation of networks and associations that bring these providers&#13;
together, with each other, with their counterparts in other countries and regions, and with manufacturers of&#13;
related goods and services. The better pump, the portable water purifier, the best drilling techniques, the new&#13;
software for billing clients that are discovered and used in one city may not be known in the next city or country.&#13;
Nationalandlocalgovernmentscould review their statutes and regulations with an eye to opening the&#13;
doors to independent providers, enabling competition, and ensuring that all providers' investments are secure&#13;
before the law. They might rethink the tradition of competition only by contract, which gives monopoly powers&#13;
of water production and distribution to a single company, and consider finding ways to subsidize low-income&#13;
users directly rather than through tariff structures or operating subsidies. And there are clear roles for&#13;
government in preventing price setting, cartels, and other monopolistic practices, mediating disputes among&#13;
providers and between providers and consumers, and monitoring water quality and service quality and&#13;
sanctioning providers who violate their contracts with their customers.&#13;
The rindependentprovidersthemselves also need to begin networking to make themselves known and&#13;
respected, developing their strength through association and business training and using it to lobby and defend&#13;
their rights while resisting the temptation to create cartels, set new entry barriers, fix prices, or restnct service&#13;
areas.&#13;

That the independent operators assure a steady supply of water to a significant percentage of Latin America's&#13;
urban population may not come as a surprise to many who have frequented the slums of the developing world.&#13;
But their diversity, creativity and advantages in reaching niche groups have perhaps not been fully appreciated in&#13;
the past. Nor, perhaps, has the potential which open entry and competition for customers can offer the water&#13;
sector-and the water user. The independent providers are important, with continuing niches, even in cities&#13;
where the utility provides good coverage. Their success in building and operating small networks challenges the&#13;
belief that fixed water networks are a natural monopoly. Competition for customers is active and it works, but it&#13;
would work better in a business environment which enabled competition rather than surrounding it with&#13;
uncertainty and inappropriate regulation. The independent providers of water present a clear challenge to public&#13;
authorities and policy makers:&#13;
-   how to develop appropriate policies, which build on the positive aspects of this private sector while&#13;
safeguarding the public health and well-being;&#13;
-   how to regulate "even playing fields" so that the virtues of a competitive market system can improve water&#13;
services;&#13;
-   how to open possibilities for multiple providers, and how to assure that effective and efficient servers are&#13;
not put at risk by regulatory systems.&#13;
As a start to answer these questions, policy makers should be encouraged to look with a fresh view at many&#13;
water providers who are investing and active in their cities.&#13;

            Independent water entrepreneurs in Latin
            America - the other private sector in water services
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The report summarizes the findings of
            research carried out by the Bank's Water and Sanitation
            Program (WSP) through 1999, outlining the six-country study
            of small scale providers in Latin America, and the important
            role that small scale service providers play in the delivery
            of services to under served , primarily poor, households in
            urban areas. Lessons also underscore the need for policy
            makers to "look with a fresh view at all water
            providers who are investing, and active in their
            cities", and to the establishment of a policy, and
            regulatory framework that enables access to water, and
            sanitation services from any actor that is able, and willing
            to meet their needs. In the cities reviewed, private
            providers reach approximately 25 percent of the local
            populations, suggesting that the private sector remain key
            to the provision of water. Sewage, collection, treatment and
            disposal however, remain a much bigger challenge for small
            providers, given the implicit economies of scale, and lower
            willingness to pay for the investments. In analyzing
            survival strategies, the report identifies the benefits of
            competition, and free entry, and the costs of operating on
            the margin of the law. Such local entrepreneurs thus appear
            as important stakeholders, that need to be involved in order
            to meet the demand for serving additional numbers of urban
            populations, in their need to access sustainable water
            supply by 2015. An important message is that the poor are
            not only willing to pay, but are actually paying for water
            services when provided, even in a less than optimal way.
