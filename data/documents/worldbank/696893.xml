costs); (f) Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) for project-affected&#13;
persons (7% of investment costs); and (g) Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plan (0.4% of investment costs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Project Benefits:       The project's policy, capacity building and investment actions would&#13;
increase the sustainability of Orissa's water resources and foster&#13;
economic growth. The State's policy actions lay the basis for&#13;
provision of reliable, equitable and assured supply of water. The&#13;
irrigation investments would enhance agricultural production on about&#13;
0.5 million ha (50% of the State's post-project major and medium&#13;
scheme command area), directly benefiting about 4 million persons.&#13;
An additional 0.3 million ha of irrigated land would be protected from&#13;
loss of irrigation and flooding. By ensuring an equitable supply of&#13;
water to all farmers in irrigated areas, the project would benefit poorer&#13;
sections of the rural community who previously received little&#13;
irrigation water (tail-enders) or unreliable supplies. Physical and&#13;
financial sustainability of irrigation would be enhanced through linkage&#13;
of system improvements with farmer participation in design,&#13;
implementation scheduling, O&amp;M and water management at the&#13;
distributary level. Creation and strengthening of a specialist state&#13;
water agency, including capacity buildup in water planning,&#13;
environmental management, R&amp;R and indigenous peoples&#13;
development, would have broad and long-term benefits stemming from&#13;
more efficient services and improved planning and management.&#13;
Poverty Category:       Not Applicable.&#13;
Project Risks:          First, risk regarding Orissa's policy reform commitment has been&#13;
addressed through extensive discussions (during project preparation)&#13;
on wide-ranging sectoral issues involving Government agencies,&#13;
NGOs and farmers, and early achievement of policy requirements for&#13;
water planning, institutional strengthening, R&amp;R and maintenance&#13;
funding. For cost recovery, an important feature for project success&#13;
are in-built reinforcing actions to ensure linkage with improved service&#13;
quality, and the establishment of an institutional mechanism to provide&#13;
status reports and propose further actions. Second, potential&#13;
implementation capacity constraints for civil works have been resolved&#13;
through attention to completion of quality feasibility studies and&#13;
detailed design, procurement packaging, and staff placement and&#13;
training. Major emphasis has thus been placed on establishing&#13;
institutional features required for the OWRCP's success. The project&#13;
is fully ready for implementation, with start-up activities already&#13;
underway.&#13;
Third, the project's innovatory farmer turnover program would require&#13;
careful attention. The project has adopted a phased approach (starting&#13;
on three schemes only), intensive early review with subsequent&#13;
adjustment to the program as needed, consultancy and training support&#13;
(for farmer organizations and DOWR staff), and a period of joint&#13;
DOWRlfarmer management prior to final turnover. As farmers would&#13;
be involved early on in defining the type of system whose operations&#13;
they would oversee, their willingness as well as technical capability to&#13;
manage the facilities would be enhanced. Finally, financial&#13;
sustainability of the project is potentially at risk due to the weak state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
fiscal situation. There are, however, various measures currently under&#13;
implementation, i.e., the public sector attrition policy, reforms of the&#13;
Orissa power sector, and mobilization of additional resources from&#13;
GOI and external donors, which will help reduce the State's primary&#13;
deficit. The OWRCP cost recovery and expenditure prioritization&#13;
policies would also strengthen Orissa's fiscal position. As part of the&#13;
project's comprehensive mid-term review, there would be a review of&#13;
overall state finances, as well as of the financial situation of the water&#13;
sector. If necessary, additional measures to achieve financial&#13;
sustainability of project benefits would be agreed based on the results&#13;
of that review.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
I. WATER RESOURCES SECTOR&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.01      The Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project (OWRCP) would support Orissa's&#13;
objectives to reformulate its policies, institutional capabilities, public expenditures, and the role of&#13;
the non-government sector in its water sector. Project genesis follows a number of strategy&#13;
papers developed by the Bank and India: GOI's National Water Policy (1987), the India&#13;
Irrigation Sector Review (1991), the Bank's policy paper Water Resources Management (1993),&#13;
and the 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India. The Bank/GOI water resources&#13;
strategy emphasizes that the efficient management and optimal planning of water resources will be&#13;
a critical need for future economic and social development in India. This requires far-reaching&#13;
change in sectoral policies and upgrading of institutional capabilities. The chosen approach of&#13;
tackling reforms at the level of whole states, recognizes that comprehensive reforms need to&#13;
implement policy, institutional and expenditure programs as a whole rather than by individual&#13;
investments, and that in India's federal structure the state is the key administrative unit for water&#13;
planning and management. The Bank's focus is on states receptive to reform and on key sectors&#13;
forming the basis for India's future growth and poverty alleviation.&#13;
1.02      Orissa approached the Bank in 1992, requesting assistance in devising and&#13;
implementing a new water sector program responsive to the above strategy papers. The project&#13;
would assist Orissa to implement its new water strategy reflected in its State Water Policy (1994).&#13;
The project would contribute to the funding of the State's water sector development program as&#13;
reformulated to implement the new strategy. This includes re-focused expenditures to improve&#13;
irrigation's productivity and reduce the backlog of incomplete investments, together with&#13;
measures to strengthen institutional capabilities. The state water agency would be strengthened in&#13;
all functional areas, including in water planning, environmental management, resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation and cost recovery. Stakeholders would be integrated in the new approach. The&#13;
project would finance the physical and institutional investments associated with the reformulated&#13;
program and new policy objectives.&#13;
Country and Sector Background&#13;
1.03      Water is an increasingly scarce resource in India. Its management in terms of&#13;
physical, economic and environmental needs is critical to economic development. India's water&#13;
resources are distributed unevenly, both spatially and seasonally. While in some states&#13;
development of surface and groundwater is reaching its physical limits, in other states such as&#13;
Orissa, substantial potential for water resources development remains, but investment must be&#13;
planned, prioritized and well implemented to achieve its potential. In all states, planning and&#13;
management of water resources need to be holistic in emphasis. This needs to be on a multi-&#13;
sectoral basis by the natural hydrological unit, the river basin, to incorporate groundwater as well&#13;
as surface water, and include environmental in addition to quantity considerations. Irrigation is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
the largest user of water in India (accounting for 93% of gross water use); however, usage for&#13;
household, industrial and other purposes is increasing rapidly. The Central Water Commission&#13;
(CWC, 1988) estimated that by 2025, community needs would double, and industrial and power&#13;
requirements would increase almost seven-fold. Thus in the future, competing uses are likely to&#13;
limit the water available for agriculture and irrigation, particularly near major metropolises and in&#13;
dry regions. These increasing demands could also force fundamental changes in irrigation&#13;
systems, cropping patterns and water use efficiency.&#13;
1.04      Agriculture and Irrigation. Agriculture is a key sector in India's economy,&#13;
contributing about 35% of GDP and 65% of employment. Despite major achievements since&#13;
independence, agricultural growth has been modest at 2.6% p.a. over the last two decades.&#13;
Irrigation has been the major engine of agricultural growth, and its past development has been&#13;
instrumental in overcoming the endemic foodgrain shortages of the 1950s and 1960s.&#13;
Nevertheless, the performance of irrigation has been well below potential, and significant issues&#13;
must be addressed to maintain and surpass its past contribution. The subsector has critical&#13;
weaknesses in most aspects of implementation and management: resource planning is weak,&#13;
water distribution is unpredictable and often inequitable, maintenance is insufficient to sustain the&#13;
existing infrastructure, institutions require strengthening, and in most states, cost recovery, design&#13;
and construction quality require improvement.&#13;
1.05      Development Priorities in India. Development plans of the Government of India&#13;
(GOI) and the state governments give priority to alleviating poverty and creating employment,&#13;
particularly in the rural areas. While per capita income has increased by 2.8% per annum over the&#13;
1980s to an average of about US$310, the impact on improvement in the standard of living of the&#13;
poor or in reducing under-employment has been constrained by rapid population growth. Of the&#13;
total population of about 900 million, an estimated 300 million live below the poverty line. About&#13;
74% of the population live in rural areas, depending directly or indirectly on agriculture. One-&#13;
third of the agricultural labor force are women, and agriculture is the main source of employment&#13;
for women in rural areas. Thus, the performance of agriculture and its main source of&#13;
productivity growth, irrigation, is intrinsically linked to India's poverty alleviation objectives.&#13;
1.06      GOI's long-term strategy is to stimulate agricultural growth and promote rural&#13;
development through improved water and land management, enhanced efficiency of irrigation and&#13;
drainage networks, strengthened research services, increased attention to environmental&#13;
protection, and improved rural infrastructure. Investment programs to address these elements and&#13;
to stimulate growth are of high priority in the Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97). Equitable&#13;
distribution of the benefits of growth and sustainability of the resource base are also emphasized.&#13;
Orissa State&#13;
1.07      General Characteristics. Orissa State is located in the eastern region of India on the&#13;
Bay of Bengal and shares borders with Bihar to the north, West Bengal to the north-east, Madhya&#13;
Pradesh to the west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south. It has a population of 32 million (1991&#13;
Census), of which 87% live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. About&#13;
38% of the State's population (one of the highest in India) belong to scheduled tribes and castes,&#13;
groups which generally have been among the least benefited, to date, by the country's economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
progress. With an average per capita annual income of US$180 (in 1990/91)' which is less than&#13;
half the all-India average, Orissa is one of the poorest states of India. In 1987/88, 45% of the&#13;
population lived below the poverty line2. For all India in the same year, the poverty incidence was&#13;
30%. Health and education standards in the State are also below the all-India average. Covering&#13;
an area of 156,000 km2 (15.6 M ha), Orissa has a relatively low population density for India of&#13;
203 persons/km2 (2 persons/ha).3 Agriculture contributes about 44% of the State's GDP and&#13;
employs nearly 75% of the State 's population. Future progress in general economic&#13;
development, and in raising the welfare of Orissa's disadvantaged groups in particular, will&#13;
depend heavily on increasing productivity and incomes in the agricultural sector.&#13;
1.08       Water Resources Sector. Orissa's endowment of water resources is relatively&#13;
favorable in the aggregate: an extensive network of rivers, streams and drainage ways annually&#13;
discharges about 100 billion m3 of water into the Bay of Bengal, and the annual flow of&#13;
groundwater into the sea is estimated at some 30 billion m3. None of Orissa's rivers are&#13;
international, and Orissa is not affected by any unresolved interstate water sharing issues. The&#13;
amount of rainfall ranges from about 1,200 mm in the southern coastal plain to about 1,700 mm in&#13;
the northern plateau and averages about 1,500 mm statewide. The distribution of water in Orissa,&#13;
however, is seasonally concentrated and inequitable within regions, making management of water&#13;
in the State a high priority for ensuring availability and timeliness of water supplies. High regional&#13;
averages mask substantial variations in quantity and time of rainfall, making supplemental&#13;
irrigation even during the kharif necessary for stable crop yields. Between 85-90% of the annual&#13;
rainfall normally occurs in the kharif (or monsoon season), the rabi (i.e., dry season) is left with&#13;
too little water for productive agriculture. Conditions are often extreme even during the kharif&#13;
(from May to October), sometimes with severe floods, droughts and cyclones in a single season.&#13;
1.09       The sector is still largely underdeveloped, yet the potential for utilization of Orissa's&#13;
water resources is limited by a number of factors: (i) more than 80% of the surface flow occurs&#13;
during the June-September period when the need for irrigation water is the lowest; (ii)&#13;
topography is not conducive to the construction of major reservoirs; and (iii) about 80% of the&#13;
groundwater resources are in the coastal plain which is already well served by surface irrigation&#13;
systems. Orissa's challenge is thus to undertake prudent investments to realize its water resources&#13;
potential based on a long-term vision of industrial, municipal and agricultural development.&#13;
Sound design, construction and subsequent operations and maintenance of water infrastructure, as&#13;
well as measures to involve beneficiaries and enhance cost recovery, are also required. In the&#13;
short-term, investment needs to be sharply focused on rehabilitating and improving the&#13;
performance of existing infrastructure and on the completion of selected viable schemes to reduce&#13;
the backlog of unfinished investments.&#13;
1.10       Water Resources Institutions. The Orissa Irrigation Department (OID) has been the&#13;
lead agency for Major and Medium Irrigation projects in the State since 1990 when the former&#13;
' Per capita Net State Domestic Product of Rs. 3596 (Economic Survey 1993-94, Economic Division, MOF, GOI), exchanged at&#13;
an official 1990/91 inter-year rate of 20.1 Rs/US$ (Jan. 1995 Department Memo).&#13;
2 Report of the Expert Group on Estimation of Proportion and Number of Poor. Perspective Planning Division, Planning&#13;
Commission, GOI. New Delhi, 1993. The poverty line for 1987-88 was Rs. 131.8 per capita per month for rural areas, and&#13;
Rs. 152.1 per capita per month for urban areas at 1987-88 prices.&#13;
3 Compared with an all-India density of 273 persons/km2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Irrigation &amp; Power Department was split into separate Irrigation and Power Departments. The&#13;
OID has been typical of India's traditional irrigation departments: long established institutions&#13;
with considerable achievements in construction of civil works, but which have become&#13;
progressively outdated as the challenge of modem water management has become increasingly&#13;
complex. Ancillary needs such as the need to plan and allocate water multi-sectorally, the need to&#13;
incorporate environmental management, to involve beneficiaries, to better prioritize expenditures&#13;
and to enhance cost recovery, have also become more apparent over time. In 1994, GOO decided&#13;
to broaden OID's mandate to incorporate these additional objectives, and named the new agency&#13;
the Department of Water Resources (DOWR, para. 1.21). A Water Resources Board with multi-&#13;
sectoral representation was established at the same time, to act as the State's highest authority for&#13;
guiding water planning and allocation.&#13;
1.11      A desirable longer term objective will be to bring groundwater resources and minor&#13;
irrigation under DOWR. Decision to keep these activities under the Department of Rural&#13;
Development recognizes the already major changes underway in DOWR and the difficulty of&#13;
absorbing extra staff at this juncture. However, in the critical areas of water resources planning&#13;
and coordination of hydrological data, these activities would now be handled by the new DOWR&#13;
to ensure the necessary conjunctive treatment of surface and groundwater resources. Other&#13;
institutions in Orissa's water sector include the government-owned Orissa Construction&#13;
Corporation (OCC), specialized in excavation of power house tunnels and manufacture of gates,&#13;
and the Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI) which provides irrigation sector&#13;
training to DOWR engineers and agricultural officers. Both OCC and WALMI are registered&#13;
under DOWR. Other training or research agencies operating in the sector are the Orissa&#13;
University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) and the Central Rice Research Institute&#13;
(CRRI).&#13;
1.12      Agriculture and Irrigation. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a&#13;
source of livelihood for the majority of Orissa's population. Production is dominated by paddy,&#13;
which accounts for 70% of agricultural production. Diversification into production of high value&#13;
crops, which typically require less water than paddy, is limited due to insufficient farm level&#13;
irrigation and drainage structures to allow for greater control over water delivery and&#13;
management. Small and marginal farmers (owning less than 2 ha) are the dominant group, with&#13;
operations over 75% of land holdings. Orissa's ample endowment of fertile alluvial soils and&#13;
water resources would suggest conditions ripe for agricultural production. Erratic climatic&#13;
conditions, however, particularly an unreliable rainfall (para. 1.08), hamper the performance of&#13;
agricultural production. Cultivation of the main crop, paddy, achieves average yields in rainfed&#13;
conditions of 1.4 t/ha of rice. Irrigated rice yields an average of 1.8 t/ha in the kharif and 2.0 t/ha&#13;
in the rabi. Irrigated yields are low reflecting the absence of effective irrigation and drainage for&#13;
most farmers, especially tail-enders operating in effect under rainfed conditions. Though paddy is&#13;
well adapted to the high rainfall and floods of Orissa, vulnerability of the fertile coastal region to&#13;
waterlogging and flooding places paddy crops at risk from moisture stress thus limiting yields&#13;
even under such conditions. Yields of rabi paddy are limited in some areas by lack of irrigation,&#13;
and in other areas (especially delta areas) by lack of adequate drainage and flood control.&#13;
Investment in irrigation, flood control and drainage, is thus a critical need for harnessing the&#13;
potential for increased agricultural growth in Orissa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.13      Current net irrigated area4 is 1.2 M ha, about 17% of the net sown area in the State of&#13;
7.0 M ha, and 8% of the total state area. Of this area, 0.8 M ha is covered by major and medium&#13;
schemes and 0.4 M ha by minor flow irrigation schemes. Groundwater facilities are reported to&#13;
service 0.8 M ha in total, through pumps (0.3 M ha), and by private dugwells and minor lift&#13;
structures (0.5 M). Irrigation potential (net) is estimated by Government at 5.9 M ha.5&#13;
Construction of major projects (over 10,000 ha) began towards the end of the nineteenth century,&#13;
when canals commanding about 150,000 ha were built in the Mahanadi and Rushikulya Deltas.&#13;
During the first half of this century, the canal irrigated area remained virtually unchanged;&#13;
however, since 1950 two major schemes (Salandi and Hirakud) have been completed and the&#13;
Mahanadi Delta system extended. Around 1960 GOO's objective of expanding irrigation&#13;
coverage initiated construction of a number of new medium irrigation projects (between 2,000-&#13;
10,000 ha). Minor surface irrigation schemes (less than 2,000 ha) constructed by farmers (small&#13;
diversion weirs and tanks for storage of local runoff during the kharif, or bucket-lift and other&#13;
traditional irrigation facilities) have been present for centuries. Such minor schemes, however,&#13;
provide only supplementary irrigation during the kharif, with coverage varying substantially from&#13;
year to year.&#13;
1.14      Environmental Needs. Actual or potential environmental concerns in Orissa are&#13;
typical of those found in the water sector for any large state or country. No one problem is&#13;
endemic statewide and conditions vary by river basin. Water logging is a major problem of the&#13;
irrigated delta of the coastal zones: about 85,000 ha out of 300,000 ha (i.e., 28%) of the&#13;
Mahanadi Delta are affected. Water quality is variable. While good in most basins, in certain&#13;
areas (e.g. upper and mid-Brahmani, lb River, mid-reaches of the Mahanadi, and lower reaches of&#13;
Rushikulya) point pollution is becoming critical particularly in view of the large potential&#13;
expansion in the mineral and industrial sector. Effluents from the AnuguVTalcher (one of the&#13;
worst 15 pollution problem areas in India) and Rourkela mining and industrial zones of the&#13;
Brahmani Basin in particular, are already polluting local water resources and threatening the&#13;
potential for development of fresh water and brackish water fisheries. Water-borne diseases such&#13;
as malaria and elephantiasis exist, due to presence of large mosquito (and other parasite) breeding&#13;
habitats. Such habitats can be exacerbated or created by poor water management or construction&#13;
practices where they lead to sources of slow moving or stagnant water.&#13;
1.15      Institutional capacity for environmental assessment and protection in Orissa is limited.&#13;
Only a few organizations such as the Department of Forest and Environment, the State Pollution&#13;
Control Board, and Orissa Remote Sensing Application Center have acquired some expertise in&#13;
environmental impact assessment in their specialty fields. Other Departments such as Industry&#13;
and Fisheries have developed limited capabilities for project processing, so as to comply with the&#13;
Environmental Protection Act (1986) and the Forest Conservation Act (1980). For the State's&#13;
water agency (the State's Department of Water Resources (DOWR), refer below), there is a need&#13;
to enhance environmental capabilities generally, in particular in water planning, in environmental&#13;
assessment for project formulation and in environmental monitoring. There is also a need to&#13;
provide a statewide multi-sectoral mechanism for incorporating environmental considerations in&#13;
4The term "net" used here follows the Indian nomenclature, where "net irrigated area" refers to land area, and avoids double&#13;
and triple counting in multiple cropped areas.&#13;
5Of which 4.9 M ha is estimated to be from surface water, 0.9 M ha from groundwater, and 0.1 M ha from other sources.&#13;
&#13;

state water planning and management. The OWRCP would assist Orissa in building up DOWR's&#13;
capability in these areas.&#13;
Orissa's Irrigation Performance &amp; Past Bank Experience&#13;
1. 16      Bank Lending Experience in Orissa. Since the mid- 1970s, the Bank Group has&#13;
financed three irrigation projects in Orissa6 and components within Orissa of three other multi-&#13;
state irrigation projects.7 Experience has been variable providing valuable lessons for design of&#13;
the OWRCP. Orissa Irrigation I Project (approved in FY77) was assessed by its Project&#13;
Completion Report (PCR) to be successful, and the civil works activities were completed to fully&#13;
satisfactory engineering and cost standards. The ERR was 19% at completion compared with&#13;
20% at appraisal. A feature contributing to the project success was attention to detailed design&#13;
standards, and close monitoring and supervision during implementation. The Mahanadi Barrages&#13;
Project (FY8 1) was also successful, and met its objective of ensuring continuity of irrigation in the&#13;
Mahanadi Delta and of reducing water wastage, without failure of the existing weirs, with an ERR&#13;
estimated at completion of 14%. Although implementation was delayed by two years due to the&#13;
need to replace the initial unsatisfactory contractor, quality and engineering standards were&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
1.17       In three other projects, Orissa has been involved in small components only. Under the&#13;
Subemarekha Irrigation Project (FY83), involving Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, civil works&#13;
were implemented by Bihar, and Orissa's component was limited to establishment of a Water and&#13;
Land Management Institute (WALMI) for irrigation sector training, and planning for its part of&#13;
the eventual Subernarekha irrigation development. While physical implementation in Bihar was&#13;
problematic, construction of the WALMI in Orissa made reasonable progress. R&amp;R was&#13;
problematic in both Bihar and Orissa, but with assistance of consultants since project closure, has&#13;
notably improved. A weakness, since overcome (paras. 1.21, 1.22, and 2.33), was the lack of&#13;
institutional capability for implementing R&amp;R and weakness in R&amp;R policy and entitlements.&#13;
Orissa's component of the ongoing multi-state Dam Safety Project (FY91) is proceeding&#13;
reasonably satisfactorily. As in other states, the time taken in finalizing designs of remedial works&#13;
was longer than anticipated, but implementation and disbursements are expected to pickup in the&#13;
1995/96 construction season. Orissa was one of the states which joined the recently closed&#13;
National Water Management Project (FY87) in the project's final years (in FY92 in Orissa's&#13;
case). Orissa's participation was thus primarily related to diagnostics, preparation of command&#13;
improvement proposals, and training. These initiatives, which have provided valuable experience&#13;
for the OWRCP's systems improvement program, would be completed as part of the OWRCP&#13;
program.&#13;
1.18       In contrast to Orissa's largely successful experience in the five Bank projects&#13;
mentioned above, the Orissa Irrigation II Project (FY83) experienced major implementation&#13;
difficulties, and was assessed unsuccessful in its PCR. A fundamental problem was that the&#13;
6 Orissa Irrigation I (Cr. 740-IN, FY77, US$58.0 M); Mahanadi Barrages (Cr. 1078-lN, FY81, US$83.0 M); and Orissa&#13;
Irrigation II (Cr. 1397-IN, FY83, US$105). Prior to the 1970s, the Bank financed only one project, Salandi Irrigation (Cr. 14-&#13;
IN, FY61, US$8.0 M).&#13;
7 These projects are: Subemarekha Irrigation (Cr. 1289-lN, FY83, US$127.0 M); National Water Management (Cr. 1770-N,&#13;
FY87, US$114 M); Dam Safety (Cr. 2241/Ln. 3325, FY91, US$153 M!.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
project attempted to undertake major construction of 18 irrigation projects without institutional&#13;
strengthening in the key technical areas required to enable success. Also, the project was initiated&#13;
without adequate detailed design of the intended civil works. The intention to have supervision&#13;
backup by an out-of-state agency (the Central Water Commission, CWC) did not provide&#13;
adequate attention to these appraisal weaknesses. Other problems noted in the PCR were weak&#13;
coordination between the different Government departments involved, poor maintenance at&#13;
project sites even during construction, weak monitoring of physical implementation, focus on&#13;
major constructions with resultant inadequate attention to irrigation operations and the secondary&#13;
and tertiary distribution systems, and delays in land acquisition and forest clearances. The PCR's&#13;
main conclusion was that major strengthening of institutional capability, which was not done,&#13;
would have been essential for successful project outcome.&#13;
1.19      Orissa's Past Performance. Orissa has a long tradition of investment in irrigation,&#13;
going back over a hundred years. Orissa's Irrigation Department (OID) has demonstrated&#13;
achievement in a wide range of civil works construction. However, as in other states, the&#13;
management and other soft areas of water have received less attention. Over time, as the&#13;
complexity and challenge of modern water management have mounted, the Department became&#13;
progressively more outdated in these areas. OID has recognized the need to evolve from a&#13;
construction oriented agency to the broader role now required, and the need to acquire enhanced&#13;
skills, both technical and managerial. Targeted areas for change identified by GOO and the Bank&#13;
during OWRCP preparation include:&#13;
&#149; Institutional Strengthening of OID, to (a) upgrade (in certain cases establish) capability&#13;
in key technical and managerial areas such as basin planning, environmental&#13;
assessment, R&amp;R, programming and budgeting, monitoring and evaluation, and&#13;
management information systems, and (b) enhance capability to communicate on its&#13;
operations with users, policy makers and the general public. (Established expertise&#13;
areas such as project formulation, design, construction and procurement also need&#13;
updating and enhancement);&#13;
*  Multi-sectoral River Basin Planning, to enable effective planning, management and&#13;
allocation of water for all sectoral users. Identified improvement areas are data&#13;
collection and documentation, basin planning analysis skills and technology, and state-&#13;
level institutional structure;&#13;
*  Expenditure prioritization, to ensure (a) funding for important activities such as&#13;
operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) of existing schemes and rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of distressed schemes, and (b) progressive completion of the substantial&#13;
backlog of ongoing projects by focusing on a few projects at a time;&#13;
*  Maintenance Funding and Implementation, to ensure sustainability of infrastructure,&#13;
and provision and quality of O&amp;M services;&#13;
*  Cost Recovery, to ensure financial sustainability of irrigation services, through linking&#13;
of service quality, water charges, and participation of users in management of O&amp;M&#13;
activities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
*  Farmer and Stakeholder Participation, to ensure sustainability, efficiency and increased&#13;
agricultural benefits, through a larger role of farmers, other stakeholders, NGOs and&#13;
the private sector in the water sector;&#13;
*  Resettlement and Rehabilitation, to (a) formulate an R&amp;R policy, and (b) establish and&#13;
upgrade institutional capability so as to adequately address the needs of people&#13;
affected by irrigation sector investments;&#13;
*  Environmental management, to build up expertise for assessing and monitoring&#13;
environmental impact, and an institutional mechanism for incorporating environmental&#13;
issues in water resources planning and management,&#13;
*  Applied Research, to enable greater exposure to technical and managerial innovations&#13;
from abroad or elsewhere in India, and&#13;
*  Agricultural Intensification, to enable additional extension support in irrigation&#13;
agronomy, along side improvements in irrigation, so that the irrigation benefits are&#13;
translated into higher yields and diversified production.&#13;
Orissa's Recent Reforms and Initiatives&#13;
1.20      Orissa's frank assessment of its capabilities and past strengths and weaknesses has&#13;
been accompanied by a major reformulation of policies and sectoral objectives during the&#13;
OWRCP preparation period. From mid-1993, DOWR's preparation effort substantially increased&#13;
and since then, DOWR and GOO commitment has grown. Particularly encouraging, and fostered&#13;
throughout preparation, has been a steady progression of significant decisions and reforms by&#13;
GOO and DOWR related to the project.&#13;
1.21      Following a detailed Institutional Study conducted by OID (in 1993) as part of&#13;
OWRCP preparation, GOO created the Water Resources Board (WRB) in 1993 to be the highest&#13;
decision-making body for state water allocation and planning. It is chaired by the Chief Secretary,&#13;
with the Secretaries of Water Resources, Municipal Administration, and Rural Development as&#13;
Vice Chairmen, and includes representation from all Government departments associated with&#13;
water use and quality. In 1994, the WRB issued a State Water Policy detailing a framework for&#13;
future development of the sector. GOO also decided to reorganize and strengthen OID into a&#13;
modern water agency along functional responsibility and decentralized lines. This has been&#13;
renamed the Department of Water Resources (DOWR) to reflect its new mandate and broader&#13;
responsibilities. Orissa established a new State Directorate (in March 1994) for handling R&amp;R in&#13;
the water sector, and issued a comprehensive new State R&amp;R Policy, making Orissa the first&#13;
Indian state to formalize a policy statement for R&amp;R at this level of completeness.&#13;
1.22      GOO/DOWR has commenced an exercise to strengthen the new water sector agency&#13;
in all technical and managerial areas (paras. 2.29 to 2.31). Other significant decisions and reforms&#13;
include: reprioritization of expenditures now emphasizing maintenance funding and&#13;
rehabilitation/modernization of existing schemes (paras. 2.42 to 2.46), establishment of an&#13;
institutional capability for R&amp;R (para. 2.33), preparation of an environmental action plan (paras.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.20 to 2.22), a commitment to full funding for operations and maintenance requirements (paras.&#13;
2.45 and 2.46), and exploration of options to improve cost recovery (paras. 2.47 to 2.49). These&#13;
decisions and actions will aid Orissa in overcoming past problems in the water sector. For&#13;
continuation and success of these initiatives, DOWR would require a sustained process of&#13;
capacity building and institutional transformation for a number of years, and would be assisted in&#13;
its efforts under the proposed OWRCP.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.01      The project would help implement at the state level the Bank/GOI strategy for water&#13;
and irrigation articulated in the Bank policy paper Water Resources Management (1993) and the&#13;
India Irrigation Sector Review (ISR, 1991) prepared jointly with GOI and state governments.&#13;
The Bank's water policy proposes: first, an agenda of policies and institutional reforms to&#13;
strengthen the capacity of governments to carry out their essential roles in resource use and&#13;
planning; and second, the adoption of a comprehensive framework for implementing policies and&#13;
management options regarding water scarcity, efficiency of service, allocation of water and&#13;
environmental issues. Specific to India, the ISR identified four priority areas of action: (i) multi-&#13;
sectoral water resources policy and planning using river basins as planning units; (ii)&#13;
institutional development to upgrade management capability of irrigation departments through&#13;
improved functional responsibilities, institutional accountability and participation of farmers and&#13;
the private sector; (iii) re-prioritization of public expenditures to emphasize improved&#13;
performance of existing schemes, enhanced operations and maintenance, completion of viable&#13;
incomplete projects, and improved cost recovery linked to service improvements; and (iv)&#13;
improved technical performance of water and irrigation service delivery, including improved&#13;
environmental management.&#13;
2.02      The project is also representative of the Bank's new lending strategy for India, as&#13;
outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which was discussed at the Board on June 20,&#13;
1995. The CAS emphasizes investment lending operations providing comprehensive support to&#13;
policy, institutional, and expenditure reform for key sectors in states receptive to reform.&#13;
Reforms would be accompanied by investments in basic infrastructure supporting increased&#13;
productivity and better management of natural iesources. Better institutional and financial&#13;
performance in the public sector, complemented by devolution of responsibilities to stakeholders&#13;
and the private sector, is also emphasized. As a key input to agriculture, water and irrigation&#13;
would play a prominent role. For the water sector, WRCPs would be the main vehicle for Bank&#13;
support in water development and irrigation which, in India, are planned and implemented at the&#13;
state level, thus requiring a state-by-state approach.&#13;
2.03      The Orissa WRCP would support the State's new water resources strategy through&#13;
funding investments under an agreed statewide program for the sector, emphasizing the new&#13;
sectoral priorities and associated institutional and policy reforms. This project would be the third&#13;
WRCP (following Haryana WRCP (Cr. 2592, FY94) and Tamil Nadu WRCP (Cr. 2745, FY95))&#13;
to provide a state with the comprehensive means to implement the new strategy. Complementing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
such state-level projects, Bank support would also be selectively provided at the national level to&#13;
foster improved performance through actions on a multi-state basis. Recent multi-state projects&#13;
include: a Dam Safety Project (FY91) currently under implementation, a recently closed National&#13;
Water Management Project (FY87), and the recently approved Hydrology Project (FY96).&#13;
2.04      To implement the new water and irrigation stra.egy, for both state-specific WRCPs&#13;
and national level projects, a close and continuous partnership between the states and the central&#13;
Government is required. The Bank is one of the few institutions that can provide this continuity&#13;
and policy support, plus the impetus for fundamental sectoral change and the exposure to&#13;
technological and institutional best practices in India and around the world, which will be required&#13;
for achieving Orissa's long-term strategic goals. Orissa is chosen as the third WRCP state&#13;
because of the interest of the State Government in reforming its water resources sector. Orissa,&#13;
one of India's poorest states, and yet with the advantage of relatively abundant land, water and&#13;
mineral resources, will need substantial investment in basic infrastructure (water, power, roads,&#13;
and social infrastructure) to enable its future growth and reduction in the State's poverty level. In&#13;
water, Orissa's still substantial potential requires effective planning and management now if the&#13;
potential major gains from its water sector are to be realized.&#13;
B. Project Objectives and Description&#13;
2.05      Project Objectives. Orissa's future economic development and social welfare require&#13;
better planning and allocation of water across sectors and, for irrigation, improved efficiency of&#13;
public expenditures and water use, and enhanced agricultural productivity. The project's primary&#13;
objectives would be to: (a) improve the planning, management and development process for the&#13;
State's water resources; (b) increase agricultural productivity through investments to improve&#13;
existing schemes and complete viable incomplete schemes; and (z) enhance DOW*R's institutional&#13;
capability. The proposed project would contribute to these objectives by helping GOO to&#13;
establish multi-sectoral water planning, enhance the efficiency of public expenditures, provide&#13;
more efficient and effective irrigation services, and upgrade DOWR's capabilities in all functional&#13;
areas.&#13;
2.06      Project Description. The Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project (OWRCP)&#13;
would be a sector investment loan, financing an agreed statewide program for Orissa's water&#13;
sector over a six year period. DOWR's state program over the project period would involve a&#13;
combination of prioritized physical investments, policy reforms, and investment in institutional&#13;
strengthening and capacity building. This would include emphasis on water planning,&#13;
environmental management, resettlement and rehabilitation, indigenous peoples development,&#13;
water sector research and agricultural intensification, as well as strengthening DOWR's&#13;
capabilities in all functional and management areas. The investment program would involve a&#13;
major reprioritization of public expenditure to emphasize maintenance of existing infrastructure&#13;
(to be funded by GOO), improved water management (through rehabilitation and modernization&#13;
of systems, linked with farmer participation/turnover and new cost recovery mechanisms) and&#13;
selective scheme completions. Project components are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
(i)          Scheme Completions (US$152.3 million, 54% of project investment base costs);&#13;
(ii)         Systems Improvement and Farmer Participation/Turnover (US$70.1 million,&#13;
24.8% of costs);&#13;
(iii)        Basin Planning and Environmental Action Plan (US$8.5 million, 3% of costs);&#13;
(iv)         Water Resources Research &amp; Agricultural Intensification (US$5.9 million, 2% of&#13;
costs);&#13;
(v)          Institutional Reorganization and Strengthening (I.JS$24.9 million, 8.8% of costs);&#13;
(vi)         Resettlement and Rehabilitation (US$19.5 million, 7% of costs); and&#13;
(vii)        Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (US$1.2 million, 0.4% of costs).&#13;
2.07      Project Readiness. The project is ready for implementation. Start-up activities have&#13;
commenced, with expenditures from January 15, 1995 proposed for retroactive financing (para.&#13;
3 18). Detailed designs are substantially complete for works planned for execution during the first&#13;
year under the scheme completions and the systems improvement and farmer turnover&#13;
components. The procurement process has commenced and is underway, with procurement&#13;
packaging for the entire project cormpleted, and sixty invitation packages (out of about a hundred&#13;
and forty) already cleared with the Bank. On one scheme completion (Naraj barrage),&#13;
prequalification proposals have been received by the DOWR and are under evaluation. With&#13;
project sites already active, readiness for civil works for scheme completions is high. As regards&#13;
the farmer turnover and agricultural intensification programs, activities to facilitate organization&#13;
and training of farmers are underway in the three pilot scheme areas. Readiness as concerns other&#13;
project components is also satisfactory. The new institutional structure has been approved and&#13;
implemented. with placement of key personnel completed. The consultancy for capacity building&#13;
in information technology has been awarded, and the initial phase of the water planning program&#13;
is well underway with four basin plans covering 70% of the State's surface area already prepared.&#13;
Training, staffing and other preparatory actions are advanced for the environmental action plan,&#13;
and the resettlement and rehabilitation action plan. The degree to which DOWR has placed its&#13;
resources toward early completion of all institutional and policy decisions (paras. 1.21 &amp; 1.22)&#13;
has been impressive and provides strong basis for project start-up.&#13;
C. Detailed Features&#13;
(I)       Scheme Completions. (US$152.3 million, 54% of project investment base costs,&#13;
Annex 7).&#13;
2.08      The largest investment component of OWRCP involves selective scheme completions&#13;
(to bring past investment into production), the construction of a replacement weir, and a&#13;
supplemental funding provision for future investment needs (para. 2.10). Of the eight sub-&#13;
projects: two involve completion of parts of major irrigation projects, one of which would use&#13;
water already available from an existing reservoir (Rengali) and the other (Mahanadi-Chitrotpala)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
would complete a distribution system; five involve the completion of medium irrigation projects&#13;
including reservoirs and irrigation distribution and drainage systems, and one (Naraj) involves the&#13;
replacement of an existing weir, more than 100 years old, with a new balTage. The sub-projects&#13;
include improvements to drainage networks and/or introduction of new drainage channels, as&#13;
needed, to prevent problems of water-logging. O&amp;M capability and far.mer participation (paras.&#13;
2.14 to 2.16) would be established in each command from the outset.&#13;
2.09       Selection of the sub-projects in the scheme completions program was based on review&#13;
of the overall state investment program, the State's development priorities, and specific reviews of&#13;
individual candidate sub-projects. This included detailed analysis by FAOCP and DOWR,&#13;
covering hydrology, engineering, agriculture and economic viability including the requirement of&#13;
an economic rate of return in excess of 12%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital in India.&#13;
The analysis provided assurance of water availability at each project site, given the hydrological&#13;
and meteorological conditions, and water requirements for crops and other uses. Orissa's Dam&#13;
Safety Review Panel (established for the OWRCP in February 1994), undertook site examination&#13;
of all major structures and found design and safety factors to be adequate. The preparation&#13;
exercise has served to inject additional analytical rigor into DOWR investment preparation,&#13;
particularly in the areas of hydrological assessment, engineering and economic analysis. An&#13;
environmental assessment was made by DOWR and consulting engineers in 1993 (paras. 2.20 to&#13;
2.22 and Annex 12), and appropriate measures incorporated for each sub-project. All sub-&#13;
projects have received GOI environmental clearance. Resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
arrangements, and indigenous community development programs, for people affected by the&#13;
construction activities are discussed at paras. 2.33 to 2.39, and Annexes 10 &amp; I1. Other salient&#13;
features of the eight sub-projects are in the table below, with further elaboration at Annex 7.&#13;

2.10       Supplementary Program. As Orissa's basin planning develops, water development&#13;
priorities not yet identified are likely to become apparent, particularly with regard to bulk water&#13;
supply needs for municipal and industrial use, or investments related to resolution of&#13;
environmental concerns. For instance, environment-related investment may be required for&#13;
Chilika Lake subsequent to additional monitoring of the ecology to be funded under the project&#13;
(para. 2.21), or for mitigation measures related to industrial pollution in some of Orissa's rivers&#13;
(para. 1. 14). A funding provision for such unidentified projects, equivalent to 10% of the base&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
costs of the above eight identified scheme completions, is provided in project costs and financing.&#13;
At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that such schemes would be selected in accordance&#13;
with criteria agreed with IDA. IDA approval would be required prior to selection of any such&#13;
new proposals. Selection of future projects would be consistent with the water planning program&#13;
and would be governed by rigorous analytical and selection criteria. The criteria for preparation&#13;
and selection of future sub-projects (Annex 15) include preparation in the context of a river basin&#13;
plan, a satisfactory environmental assessment, a socio-economic survey, a resettlement and&#13;
economic rehabilitation plan (as needed), an indigenous peoples development plan (as needed),&#13;
and a rate of return not less than 12%.&#13;
(II)      Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover (SI1T). (US$70.1 million, 24.8% of&#13;
project investment base costs, Annex 6).&#13;
2. 11     Selected existing irrigation and drainage infrastructure of major and medium schemes,&#13;
including headworks, bulk distribution and other components, would be rehabilitated and&#13;
modernized. All of the selected schemes are performing below potential due to inappropriate&#13;
operational concept, modernization needs for canals and structures, inadequate water control and&#13;
regulating structures, lack of maintenance brought about by inadequate funding for maintenance,&#13;
and aging infrastructure. As a result, water services are unreliable and inequitable, resulting in&#13;
agricultural productivity substantially below potential&#13;
2.12      The project draws on lessons learnt from previous irrigation projects in India and&#13;
world wide. Systems improvements would be linked to significantly increased levels of&#13;
beneficiary participation in the design and implementation of system improvement works and,&#13;
ultimately, the turnover of the management of operations and maintenance to farmers (paras.&#13;
2.14-2.16). Improved levels of service would attract and be linked to higher water charges&#13;
(paras. 2.48 and 2.49). This integrated approach to service levels, farmer management, and cost&#13;
recovery would be supported by strengthened institutional capabilities for water services (i.e.,&#13;
O&amp;M) management. The project would fund strengthening of DOWR's WALMI (which would&#13;
provide technical and management training), surveying and other equipment, vehicles, computers,&#13;
software, communications equipment and remote sensing technical assistance.&#13;
2.13      Infrastructural Improvements. System improvements are summarized in the following&#13;
table. The works cover some 265,400 ha in five (part) majors, 12 medium schemes and in a&#13;
further eight ex-NWMP schemes. Identification of infrastructui e improvements was based on a&#13;
detailed command diagnostic (cropping pattern, yields, hydrology, and current performance and&#13;
problems). This was followed by preparation of system diagnostics addressing the specific&#13;
shortcomings of the system, and improved operational plans to enhance system reliability and&#13;
equity of water distribution. Improvements would begin with the main and branch canals over the&#13;
first two years. The focus would then shift to the distributary/minor level to provide a structured&#13;
network capable of delivering water with the minimum amount of manual operations, to all off-&#13;
takes in proportion to areas commanded. Average cost of rehabilitation and modernization works&#13;
would be Rs. 8540/ha (US$264/ha). Participation of farmers would take place at the outset, at&#13;
least informally. As water user associations are formed (para. 2.14), farmers in scheme areas&#13;
would be involved to an increasing degree in design, implementation scheduling, and operational&#13;
planning options for their distributary, minor and micro canals.&#13;

2. 14         Farmer Organization and Turnover (FOT). A primary focus of the SIFT component&#13;
would be the transfer of responsibility for O&amp;M of the distributaries and minor canals from&#13;
DOOWR to water user associations (WUAs). The WUAs would be registered societies and would&#13;
manage a hydrologically-delineated portion of the command area ranging in size from  300-600 ha.&#13;
The process of forming WUAs would include negotiations between the water users and DOWR&#13;
regarding improvements to be carried out within the particular irrigation system. Farmer&#13;
participation would be closely integrated with the physical improvements to be funded by the&#13;
project. By involving farmers early on in defining the type of system whose operations they&#13;
would oversee, their willingness as well as technical capability to manage the facilities would be&#13;
enhanced. The lowest level WlAs would be Farmer Councils, which would be federated within a&#13;
branch or an entire project command area to form "Apex Committees" with advisory and&#13;
representational roles on overall water management and on cross-Council issues. Each WUA&#13;
would have formal By-laws and would agree with DOWR to terms and conditions of turnover to&#13;
be spelled out in a written contract (Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)). Under the&#13;
agreement, farmers would be assured a guaranteed supply of water from the main system which&#13;
would continue to be managed by the DOWR. A model MOU and model By-laws were formally&#13;
issued by GOO prior to negotiations (Attachments I and 2 of Annex 6).&#13;
2.15          The FOT sub-component would be implemented in three overlapping stages, each of&#13;
two to three years duration (details at Annex 6, including scheduling of activities). Phase I would&#13;
comprise a concentrated learning phase focused on an area of about 15,519 ha in three locations&#13;
(Rushikulya Distributary #1 1, Godahada, and Aunli). In view of the importance of the FOT&#13;
program to the success of the SIFT component and, in particular, farmer participation and tumover&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
objectives including linkage with the project's cost recovery objective, implementation and monitoring&#13;
of this program would receive major emphasis by DOWR. A special review of the FOT program in&#13;
PY2 would be used to make decisions regarding modifications of the SIFT component, including&#13;
adjustment and expansion to cover an additional 135,000 ha in 18 project locations during Phases&#13;
II and III, or scaling back of the SIFT component and the project, if necessary. Formal turnover of&#13;
O&amp;M responsibility to WUAs would be accompanied by intensive training by WALMI to support&#13;
organizational strengtheniiig of the WUAs and by a period of 'joint management'. Funding would&#13;
cover WALMI training costs, equipment and consultancies. All O&amp;M costs (such as of labor for&#13;
canal de-silting or weeding) below the distributary head would be borne by the farmers. Transfer&#13;
of O&amp;M responsibility to farmers, necessary to ensure farmer ownership in canal investments.&#13;
would be part of the MOU between WUAs and DOWR. Farmer contributions to their WUA for&#13;
establishment of an O&amp;M fund would be made prior to commencement of distributary level&#13;
improvements. Additional contributions would be collected annually or as needed by the farmers.&#13;
At negotiations, GOO confirmed these arrangements (paras. 2. 14 &amp; 2.15), and also agreed that&#13;
not later than March 31, 1998, GOO would complete the turnover of the rehabilitated&#13;
distributaries and minors in the pilot commands of the farmer turnover program (i.e., Rushikulya&#13;
disty. #1 1, Ghodahada and Aunli), to beneficiary farmers for O&amp;M. under terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. Organization arrangements for FOT, including extensive use of consultants&#13;
and NGOs for community organization, are discussed at paras. 4.10, 4.11 and Annex 6.&#13;
2.16      On-Farm Development (OFD) Works. Farmer participation would also extend to on-&#13;
farm development (OFD), which provides the important link between the irrigation system and&#13;
farmers' fields. These include water courses, field channels and field drains. The project would&#13;
support a substantially modified approach to the State's program of OFD works: (i) investment&#13;
by farmers would be required, to ensure that on-farm works are both affordable and sustainable;&#13;
and (ii) DOWR technical assistance would be extended only where Farmer Councils at&#13;
distributary levels had been formed. DOWR would undertake the topographical survey&#13;
delineating water course and field channel alignments, as well as construction of structures or&#13;
profile works at critical locations. The bulk of the field channel systems would be constructed by&#13;
farmer organizations utilizing their own funds and labor. T'echnical assistance would be provided&#13;
by DOWR to farmer organizations where necessary. The cost of assistance provided by DOWR&#13;
would be limited to Rs. 1000/ha (compared with Rs. 3500/ha at present). It is estimated that a&#13;
total of 156,300 ha. would have OFD works at an estimated cost of Rs. 156.3 M.&#13;
(III)     Basin Planning and Environmental Action Plan. (US$8.5 million, 3% of investment&#13;
base costs, Annexes 5 and 12).&#13;
Basin Planning (US$6.7 million, Annex 5)&#13;
2.17      Comprehensive river basin planning leading to a functional State Water Plan,&#13;
including establishment of a permaner.t institutional and technical capability in this area, is a key&#13;
objective of the OWRCP. The institutional apparatus for this was created during OWRCP&#13;
preparation, including the Water Resources Board (para. 1.21). Under the WRB, DOWR's&#13;
Orissa Water Planning Organization (OWPO) is the nodal agency for preparing and revising river&#13;
basin plans and the state water plan, and the technical Secretariat of WRB. OWPO was formed&#13;
from DOWR's previous Basin Planning Unit, with status elevated to Chief Engineer level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Incremental staffing and provision of consultancy, training and equipment would be provided&#13;
under the project (refer costs at Annex 18). Formal establishment of OWPO was part of the&#13;
DOWR reorganization implemented prior to negotiations (para. 2.29).&#13;
2.18      The State Water Plan, and its component basin plans, would be the corner stone for&#13;
future water resources development in Orissa. Preparation would be undertaken in four phases or&#13;
spirals". The initial spiral would involve identification of all water and related land resources as&#13;
well as existing and planned water resouice uses in each of the State's basins. For interstate&#13;
basins, preparation of the basin plans would be undertaken within the framework of existing&#13;
interstate agreements (Annex 5). Any interstate issues that arise in the course of basin planning&#13;
would be identified in the plans. The first spiral has been underway with good progress during&#13;
OWRCP preparation. DOWR has prepared four such basin plans (together covering 70% of the&#13;
State's surface area), has commenced a rigorous training program, and has engaged an&#13;
international consulting firm (Euroconsult) for provision of technical assistance. The succeeding&#13;
three phases would employ increasingly sophisticated techniques, including environmental&#13;
modeling analysis and application of enhanced computer technologies, to further assess the&#13;
availability of existing resources in the context of, inter alia, present and projected future demands&#13;
for all uses of water, water quality, and land use.&#13;
2.19      Consolidation of the individual basin plans into an integrated State Water Plan is&#13;
scheduled for full completion in the year 2001, inclusive of master plans at sub-basin, block and&#13;
village levels. Thereafter the upgrading of the State Water Plan would be a continuous process&#13;
involving new development and conservation issues as they arise. Throughout the project period,&#13;
emphasis would be on progressive capacity building of OWPO, a process already well launched&#13;
with assistance of the Bank, FAOCP and international consultants. The above arrangements and&#13;
timetable has been affirmed in GOO's Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1).&#13;
Environmental Management and Action Plan (US$1.8 million, Annex 12)&#13;
2.20      Based on the recommendations of a Category A Sectoral Environmental Assessment&#13;
Study (SEA, 1993, revised 1995 and summarized at Annex 12),8 conducted by staff of DOWR in&#13;
cooperation with Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation of Australia, environmental&#13;
management has been integrated in all aspects of the OWRCP, from institutional and policy&#13;
reform to river basin planning and project preparation. The SEA provides a detailed review of&#13;
water-related environmental issues in the State, an assessment of each of the investment&#13;
components of the project, and also a review of the capacity of the State (and in particular&#13;
DOWR) to handle environmental issues at the state level (SEA Executive Summary at Annex 12).&#13;
The project's investment components themselves were found to have a net positive impact. The&#13;
improved water management resulting from the project's scheme completion and&#13;
rehabilitation/modernization investments was assessed to mitigate against problems such as&#13;
waterlogging, depletion of groundwater levels and disease risks caused by sources of stagnant&#13;
water. Specific environmental protection measures where identified as applicable by scheme, have&#13;
been incorporated in the scheme's investment program. Beyond such specific measures, the&#13;
SEA's principle recommendations comprise a comprehensive set of actions to improve DOWR's&#13;
8 The SEA was initially undertaken in October 1993, enabling integration of recommuendations early in project preparation.&#13;
The SEA was updated by DOWR in 1 994. and further revised/finalized in March 1995 Nkith assistance of ENVLW &amp; ASTEN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
environmental capability to monitor, plan, develop and manage the State's water resources. These&#13;
measures, which incorporate institutional and procedural improvements, in addition to a major&#13;
strengthening of technical capabilities for environmental assessment and management, have been&#13;
incorporated in an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) to be funded under the project (para. 2.22).&#13;
2.21      For one of the project's investment components, Naraj Barrage, the SEA&#13;
recommended an additional analysis to assess how the barrage could be managed to help&#13;
safeguard the ecology of Chilika Lake. Chilika Lake's fragile brackish water eco-system is&#13;
progressively deteriorating due, inter alia, to excessive silt deposition and reductions in salinity.&#13;
Failure of the existing Naraj weir (to be replaced by Naraj barrage) would have serious flooding&#13;
consequences in the Mahanadi Delta and deleteriously impact on Chilika Lake. The barrage&#13;
safeguards against this risk and also provides capability for additional environmental enhancement.&#13;
Accordingly, an operational assessment for the barrage was carried out by DOWR with assistance&#13;
of international consultants (Euroconsult/Delft Hydraulics) in 1995.9 This has developed&#13;
operational rules for the Naraj  Barrage to satisfy water needs in the Delta Stage I irrigation&#13;
systems and in Lake Chilika, and to reduce flooding in Delta Stage II irrigation areas. The&#13;
operational rules would provide an important tool needed to maintain the salinity gradient and&#13;
reduce sediment loading of Lake Chilika, contributing to the preservation of this unique&#13;
ecosystem. The EAP also includes a program to monitor the aquatic environment of Chilika Lake&#13;
and undertake pilot studies (para. 2.22). This is needed because other and larger impacts are also&#13;
affecting the lake, due in part to siltation from other rivers and streams into the lake, but in&#13;
particular from the limited degree of sea water intrusion into the lake through gaps in the sandbars&#13;
on the seaward side. Such gaps change unpredictably due to movements resulting from littoral&#13;
drift of sand and, in particular, from cyclones. Resolution, if feasible, of these impacts requires&#13;
improved monitoring and careful study. Funding for such monitoring and pilot studies and a&#13;
public awareness program is included under the OWRCP's Environmental Action Plan. This sub-&#13;
component would primarily be implemented by Chilika Development Authority (para. 2.22). If,&#13;
as knowledge develops, further measures to protect Chilika Lake are identified, funding could be&#13;
provided for such investments through the OWRCP's 'Supplementary Program" (para. 2.10).&#13;
2.22      In the EAP the following actions would be implemented (Annex 12):&#13;
*   Establishment of a multi-disciplinary environmental sub-group in WRB and of two&#13;
environmental cells, one in OWPO and the second in the Project Planning and&#13;
Formulation Unit. A laboratory and associated equipment for these cells would be&#13;
financed under the project;&#13;
*  Extensive training and technical assistance to upgrade environmental management&#13;
skills. On-the-job training through pairing of DOWR's environmental staff with&#13;
consultant specialists would be a large part of the training program. Awareness&#13;
building for DOWR engineers and the general public would also be included;&#13;
9 Refer to the supplementary EA report on Naraj barrage including its impact on Chilika Lake: "Operational Rules&#13;
for the New Naraj Barrage", June 1995 (Euroconsult/Delft Hydraulics/DOWR). In project files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
*   Strengthening of OWPO to enable effective monitoring and measurement of all&#13;
aspects of surface water hydrology including water quality, i.e., siltload, bedload,&#13;
salinity, and organic and inorganic pollutants, including heavy metals and other&#13;
hazardous chemicals;&#13;
*  Shift administration of the Groundwater Development Agency, which at present is&#13;
under the Rural Development Department, under the control of DOWR so as to&#13;
facilitate the conjunctive use and development of surfice and groundwater resources.&#13;
Since the level of groundwater utilization is still low, this is the right time to develop&#13;
groundwater legislation and regulations, including the issuing of licenses and&#13;
rationalization of water charges, for the sustainable use of groundwater resources;&#13;
*  Prepare a detailed watershed management master plan for each basin in consultation&#13;
with the Soil Conservation and Forest Departments of the Government of Orissa.&#13;
The environmrent cells in DOWR would be assigned with the task of preparing&#13;
watershed management plans as part of environmental studies for river basins;&#13;
-  Establish an applied research program to undertake studies for integration of&#13;
environmental issues in the river basin plans; and&#13;
*  Fund a program to monitor the aquatic environment of Chilika Lake, including&#13;
implementation of pilot studies and a public awareness program (to be implemented&#13;
by Chilika Development Authority; funding provisions would be provided through&#13;
DOWR for equipment, materials, vehicle, consultancy, training and related civil&#13;
works),&#13;
Funding of the entire EAP would be through the WRCP, including incremental and specialist&#13;
environmental staff, extensive training, and technical assistance.&#13;
(IV)     Water Resources Research &amp; Agricultural Intensification. (US$5.9 million, 2% of&#13;
investment base costs, Annexes 8 and 9).&#13;
Water Resources Research Fund (WRRF, US$3.4 million, Annex 8)&#13;
2.23      The Water Resources Research Fund (WRRF) would finance technology transfer and&#13;
problem-solving applied research by non-DOWR institutions emphasizing linkages between&#13;
Orissan institutions and other Indian or foreign institutions. It would be available on a grant basis&#13;
for carefully screened and approved research or technology transfer proposals. Eligibility for a&#13;
grant would require some participation from an Orissa-based private or public institution and&#13;
would strongly favor collaboration with other Indian or foreign institutions. It would thus foster&#13;
strengthening of Orissan capabilities while harnessing ideas and technology from outside. It&#13;
would also develop linkages between DOWR and academic institutions in Orissa in both the&#13;
public and private sectors. While overall orientations for the WRRF are provided below and in&#13;
Annex 8, the WRRF is deliberately flexible in formulation. The key objective is to establish a&#13;
dynamic instrument for catalyzing change and seeking innovation. Needs and objectives would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
continually adapting. The proactive institutional apparatus created, and its contacts with water&#13;
sector thinkers worldwide, would itself be an engine for change.&#13;
2.24      A Research Advisory Comnrnittee (RAC) would assist DOWR in administering the&#13;
WRRF. The RAC would comprise five experts (excluding active government staff) with&#13;
outstanding capabilities in the fields of engineering, agriculture, environmental science, economics&#13;
and social science. At least one member would have experience in the urban and industrial&#13;
sectors. The EIC or his delegate would be Member Secretary. The RAC would be proactive in&#13;
identifying and promoting problem-solving research and technology transfers in the water sector,&#13;
in screening research proposals for quality and applied focus, in assessing the research capability&#13;
of each applicant, and in providing the EIC with scientific and professional advice on research&#13;
matters. Priority would be given to research proposals on: cross-sectoral issues in water&#13;
management and planning; hydrology and engineering; water allocation, markets and prices;&#13;
basin management and planning; farmer and local participation in water management and system&#13;
turnover; water efficient irrigation systems; and environmental impacts of irrigation, drainage,&#13;
urban and industrial use.&#13;
2.25      DOWR would fund approved research proposals on a grant basis, and IDA would&#13;
reimburse DOWR 100% against eligible expenditures for such research contracts. To enable&#13;
progressive establishment of a permanent fund, GOO would contribute quarterly to an interest&#13;
earning account in the name of WRRF, an amount equal to one-third of IDA disbursements to&#13;
DOWR the previous quarter. IDA would thus not directly finance the fund--disbursements would&#13;
be made against eligible contracts under the WRRF program--but GOO's contributions would&#13;
progressively build up the fund. The program would be reviewed by IDA annually, on the basis&#13;
of an annual report prepared by the RAC. The above arrangements were confirmed at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
Agricultural Intensification Program (AIP, US$2.5 million, Annex 9)&#13;
2.26      The Agricultural Intensification Program (AIP) would complement the systems&#13;
improvements and farmer turnover (SIFT) program, with parallel efforts to improve agricultural&#13;
farming practices. With reliable and timely water delivery, agriculture can be significantly&#13;
intensified. The AIP would fund activities to enhance the quality of extension services in irrigated&#13;
commands, and develop an improved package of agricultural practices through adaptive research&#13;
programs and field demonstrations in key areas of water management and irrigation agronomy.&#13;
The AIP would facilitate coordination among various agencies (e.g. the Department of&#13;
Agriculture (DOA), DOWR's WALMI, the Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology&#13;
(OUAT) and the Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI)), to strengthen agricultural development&#13;
services, provide specialized irrigation agronomy and water management courses, and disseminate&#13;
the extension messages to farmers. Extension agents would target farmer organizations rather&#13;
than individual farmers, and training would be provided to extension staff and members of farmer&#13;
organizations. All essential agricultural inputs would be made available through single-window&#13;
input delivery services. Where possible, establishment of marketing tie-ups with agro-industries,&#13;
private entrepreneurs, or farmer consortiums would be fostered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
2.27      Apex Committee Centers. Field interaction with farmers would be primarily through&#13;
Apex Committee Centers. Commands with successfully operating "Apex Committees" (para.&#13;
2.15) would be provided with a simple building comprising a large multi-purpose room and four&#13;
offices. Two of the offices at the centers would be made available to DOWR and DOA, and the&#13;
third office would accommodate the Apex Committee. The fourth office would be made available&#13;
to agro-industries or farmer consortiums, arid for the display, hiring and possible selling of&#13;
affordable farm implements, machinery and other equipment developed by private firms or the&#13;
State Agricultural Engineering wing of DOA. The large multi-purpose room would be each&#13;
center's main feature and would be used for community gatherings and farmer training courses.&#13;
Training needs would primarily be identified by the farmer organizations (in collaboration with&#13;
DOA and DOWR) to ensure relevance of training to farmer needs. Each center would be&#13;
equipped with necessary facilities to organize training programs, seminars and workshops,&#13;
including furniture, audio-visual aids (i.e., television set, video cassette recorder, video and&#13;
ordinary camera, overhead projector, slide projector, posters, charts, and slides), and library&#13;
facilities (bulletins, journals, and publications on irrigation agronomy).&#13;
2.28      Implementation of the AIP would be phased in accordance with the FOT program&#13;
(paras. 2.14 to 2.16), initially on 3 of the 25 SIFT commands during the first two years of the&#13;
project. Based on this intensive piloting experience, it would be adapted as needed and expanded&#13;
to cover other commands as the SIFT/FOT program gains momentum.&#13;
(V)       Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building. (US$24.9 million, 8.8% of&#13;
investment base costs, Annex 3).&#13;
2.29      Institutional Modifications and Strengthening (Annex 3). The OWRCP would&#13;
support the institutional restructuring in Orissa's water sector which is already under way (para.&#13;
1.21). Key features of the reorganization are:&#13;
*  a broader mandate for DOW1R to now include: (a) basin and state water planning&#13;
under the auspices of the WRB: (b) responsibility for hydrological data storage and&#13;
dissemination; and (c) to be more explicitly responsible for drainage, bulk water&#13;
supply, flood control, and environmental management;&#13;
*  decentralization of management along river basin lines including substantial transfer of&#13;
decision making to field managers;&#13;
*  reorganization of central DOWR units around functionally specialized management&#13;
areas (water services (O&amp;M), water planning, project planning and formulation,&#13;
design and research, hydrometry, and training, (WALMI); and&#13;
*  strengthening, or creation as needed, of corporate management areas (management&#13;
information systems, programming and budgeting, monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
procurement, human resources plaining, and public information).&#13;
2.30      DOWR's reorganization would be followed by a sustained process of capacity&#13;
building throughout the OWRCP period. Requirements to achieve this have been worked out for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
each of DOWR's new management units and for DOWR as a whole. Project funding would&#13;
cover the related consultancy, training, study tours, equipment and materials to achieve these&#13;
objectives. Progress of the OWRCP's institutional strengthening objectives would be reviewed at&#13;
time of DOWR's Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget exercise (para. 4.06), enabling regular&#13;
focus on achievements and a mechanism for adaptation or remedial actions as required.&#13;
Government Orders putting into effect the remaining organizational details following the agreed&#13;
organizational structure at Annex 3, and placement of key staff, were issued prior to negotiations.&#13;
Integration of groundwater resources into DOWR's organizational structure, though not planned&#13;
immediately, is recognized as a key future need (para. 1.1 1). Groundwater would be addressed,&#13;
however, by DOWR in the context of river basin planning, hydrological data collection and&#13;
analysis, and environmental management.&#13;
2.31      Communications and Information Technology Systems (US$10.9 million). Also&#13;
essential to DOWR's effectiveness is upgraded information technology. DOWR's proposals&#13;
include. (i) an O&amp;M based communications system for all activities and general data transmission&#13;
for DOWR, (ii) a pilot project consultancy to prepare procurement documents for the Mahanadi&#13;
Delta Stages I and II communication system; (iii) a consuitancy to prepare a feasibility report for&#13;
a statewide communications system and to advise the government on procurement issues for the&#13;
O&amp;M telecommunications system, and (iv) a consultancy for long term development of a&#13;
comprehensive Management Information System (MIS), including preparation of an Information&#13;
Technology Strategic Plan (ITSP) (refer Annex 13, Attachment 3). These initiatives would be&#13;
linked with ongoing programs and systems, such as the flood warning and forecasting systems for&#13;
the Mahanadi basin (initiated under the Dam Safety Project, FY91) and the Brahmani basin (under&#13;
the Hydrology Project, FY96). The DOWR system would enable computer-based administration,&#13;
technical management and transmittal of hydrological information that would inter-connect all&#13;
field construction, O&amp;M, early tlood warning and control, and data collection units with DOWR&#13;
headquarters. DOWR has prepared a TOR for the ITSP consultancy which is acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, and has identified a consultancy firm to carry out the work. Costs of the ITSP include Rs.&#13;
152 million for telecommunications and telemetry equipment and Rs. 35 million for equipment&#13;
operations over the OWRCP lending period.&#13;
2.32      Public Awareness and Information Strategy (Annex 14). DOWR also intends to&#13;
develop a public awareness and information unit with the primary responsibility of communicating&#13;
the overall objectives of the project and progress to the staff, farmers and other user groups,&#13;
government departments, politicians, NGOs and the general public (details at Annex 14).&#13;
Information would be promulgated through various media: on institutional change, take up of&#13;
technology, the development of the state water plan, environmental management, improvement in&#13;
water service levels, cost recovery and pricing of services, farmer participation and turnover of&#13;
responsibilities, R&amp;R, agricultural intensification, production, storage, and marketing of crops.&#13;
The unit would use a combination of weekly radio bulletins, periodical television programming,&#13;
news bulletins at Panchayat level, use of local art forms for dissemination of programs, and the&#13;
organization of workshops at block and Panchayat levels and through agricultural fairs at both&#13;
state and district level. The project would finance the setting up of the unit, provision of office&#13;
space, equipment and materials. The cost estimate for these investments is Rs. 0.4 million&#13;
(US$0.1 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
(VI)      Resettlement and Rehabilitation. (R&amp;R, US$19.5 million, 7% of investment base&#13;
costs, Annex 10).&#13;
2.33      The project's resettlement and rehabilitation (R&amp;R) component, described at Annex&#13;
10, provides a comprehensive program to be funded under the project to enable all project&#13;
displaced and affected persons (PDPs/PAPs) to maintain or improve their incomes and welfare on&#13;
a sustainable basis. In preparation for the OWRCP, two major initiatives were taken by GOO.&#13;
First, based on careful review by GOO of its existing procedures and the Bank's R&amp;R Guidelines,&#13;
a new "Orissa State R&amp;R Policy" was issued in 1994, making Orissa one of the few states in India&#13;
to issue a statewide R&amp;R policy (other states have issued project-specific directives&#13;
supplementing less comprehensive state policies). This policy applies to all future R&amp;R in&#13;
Orissa's water sector. Under the new policv: (i) the criteria for eligibility as a project-affected&#13;
person (PAP)/project displaced person (PDP) have been expanded;'° and (ii) entitlements and&#13;
benefits have been significantly improved (see below). Secondly, with the establishment of the&#13;
R&amp;R Directorate in DOWR in 1994, a permanent institutional structure was created to implement&#13;
R&amp;R in the water sector. This is described at paras. 4.14 and 4.15 and the organizational chart at&#13;
Annex 10 Attachment 3. The governmental apparatus includes the R&amp;R Directorate in overall&#13;
charge, a state-level R&amp;R coordination committee including all relevant government departments,&#13;
district-based rehabilitation advisory committees including NGO representation, and field staff&#13;
based at all R&amp;R sites. An NGO at each site would play the primary implementation role.&#13;
Backing this, in addition to consultant assistance for implementation, independent consultants&#13;
would be used for periodic independent evaluations of the program. As concerns field&#13;
implementation, for each project site involving land acquisition, a detailed socio-economic survey&#13;
(SES) has been undertaken, and on that basis a Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan&#13;
(RAP) has been prepared. For tribal communities, their additional social and cultural needs have&#13;
been catered for on the basis of supplementary surveys and resultant Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plans (paras. 2.37 to 2.39 and Annex 11). The program is fully ready for&#13;
implementation on all sites and on most sites implementation is already under way. This has&#13;
included staff training and consultancy assistance, which would continue to be emphasized&#13;
throughout implementation so as to build up permanent capability.&#13;
2.34      R&amp;R is required on seven scheme compietion sites: Rengali, Badanalla, Harabhangi,&#13;
Hariharjore, Upper Jonk, Baghua, and Mahanadi-Chitrotpala (R&amp;R is not involved for SIFT&#13;
commands). Socio-economic surveys and RAPs have been completed on all sites. In total about&#13;
1,799 ha of private lands, plus about 1,680 ha of government lands (primarily unused wastelands)&#13;
and about 1,636 ha of forest lands, would need to be acquired for the OWRCP investment&#13;
program. About 2,596 persons would be displaced (project displaced persons-PDP) and about&#13;
31,207 persons would be affected in varying degrees though not displaced (project-affected&#13;
persons, i.e., PAPs). About 76% of the land acquired would be due to canal/drainage&#13;
construction and 24% due to submergence/reservoirs. The RAPs cater to the needs of all&#13;
displaced and affected persons above.&#13;
10 Eligible persons now include landless categories, i.e.. landless laborers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers and&#13;
encroachers. Also included are unmarried daughters older than 30 years of age and widows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
2.35      Entitlements include (additional to the compensation payment for land acquisition),&#13;
productively comparable "land-for-land" as a first option, with "rehabilitation assistance" to&#13;
purchase productive assets or to establish a new business as an elective alternative option&#13;
available to PAPs at their request. Under the "land for land" option, one acre of unirrigated or&#13;
0.5 acres of irrigated land would be provided for each acre of cultivated land lost, up to a&#13;
maximum of four acres of unirrigated or two acres of irrigated land. Displaced landless persons&#13;
(including landless laborers, sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and encroachers) would be provided&#13;
four acres of unirrigated land or two acres of irrigated land. Such entitlements would also apply&#13;
to encroachers on "objectionable lands"' as indicated in paras. 22 to 25 and paras. 43 to 44 of&#13;
Annex 10, and in Appendix I to Attachment I of Annex 10 To the extent possible, land&#13;
provisions would be in the newly-irrigated areas and some 75% or more of land provisions are&#13;
expected to be irriuated. All PDPs wouild be provided "maintenance allowance" during the re-&#13;
establishment process (at least one vear after displacement). Entitlements include several&#13;
enhancements as detailed in Annex 10. PDPs losing their homesteads would be provided&#13;
"homestead land" or an elective cash grant in lieu of land, and a "home construction allowance".&#13;
Additionally, existing government rural development and poverty alleviation schemes would be&#13;
targeted to displaced and affected persons, including an OWRCP-financed fisheries income-&#13;
generating scheme on the created reservoirs. Many such government programs exist (refer Annex&#13;
10 paras. 28 to 29) and a few have special features and emphasis for reaching tribals, women, and&#13;
poverty groups Tribal persons are specially catered for under the R&amp;R Action Plan through&#13;
specific measures included in the RAPs. These include access to forest lands, infrastructure&#13;
facilities based on identified tribal needs, selection of economic rehabilitation activities tailored to&#13;
the individual needs of each tribal farnily, selection of government development programs with a&#13;
tribal development focus, and selection of NGOs with experience in working with tribals.&#13;
Additionally, further measures for tribal communities are included in the Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plan (IPDP) described at paras. 2.37 to 2.39. NGOs would play the primary role in&#13;
ensuring PAPs access to all of the above benefits. Initial experience with NGOs already&#13;
contracted for the OWRCP on several commands is positive with indication already that practical&#13;
locally-based NGOs are well-suited for this work. The benefits for PAPs and PDPs from the&#13;
R&amp;R Action Plan are assessed in paras. 21 to 25 of Annex 10. The analysis indicates that,&#13;
properly implemented, PAPs and PDPs would have incomes enhanccd under the project. Gains in&#13;
living standards would be expected to be particularly substantial in the case of landless PAPs,&#13;
including encroachers (Annex 10, paras. 24 &amp; 25). Special measures have also been provided for&#13;
women's needs (Annex 10. para. 28).&#13;
2.36      Implementation would be under DOWR's R&amp;R Directorate (paras. 4.14 &amp; 4.15).&#13;
Under the project, GOO would finance land acquisition, homestead land and the maintenance&#13;
allowance. IDA funding would be for related civil works, equipment, vehicles, in-country and&#13;
overseas training and consultancies, incremental staff and operating costs for the R&amp;R Directorate&#13;
(on a declining scale to zero by PY6, para. 3.16), and NGO contracts for implementation of the&#13;
RAPs and IPDPs Consultancy provisions include allowance for additional SESs, IPDPs and&#13;
RAPs for future projects, and for project monitoring &amp; evaluation. The program also includes&#13;
provisions for retrofit surveys and additional retrofit economic rehab;litation measures as may be&#13;
identified for Rengali Hydropower Dam and the Subernarekha Irrigation Project. These earlier&#13;
investments have been identified by GOO as likely to require additional economic rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
measures for previously affected persons. Such measures could be income-generation activities or&#13;
community infrastructure as may be identified by the surveys. At negotiations, an assurance was&#13;
obtained that R&amp;R would be implemented in accordance with the R&amp;R Plan in a manner and&#13;
timetable acceptable to IDA. Implementation features above, in paras. 4.14 &amp; 4.15, and as fully&#13;
detailed in Annex 10 were also agreed. Annex 10 will be appended to a supplemental letter to be&#13;
signed along with the legal documents following Board approval.&#13;
(VIl)     Indigenous Peoples Development Plan. (IPDP, US$1.2 million, 0.4% of investment&#13;
base costs, Annex I 1).&#13;
2.37      The tribal population in Orissa is among the poorest, most vulnerable and exploited&#13;
groups in the state. Being traditionally dependent on forests for their survival, most tribal&#13;
communities are confined to the more hilly and remote areas. However, with access to forests&#13;
and other natural resources being increasingly curtailed, the tribals in Orissa find themselves in a&#13;
downward spiral of impoverishment. To cater for the special needs of tribal communities, an&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) has been prepared for six project sites: Rengali,&#13;
Badanalla, Harabhangi, Hariharjore, Upper Jonk, and Baghua. The total tribal population in the&#13;
sub-projects to benefit from the IPDP component is close to 57,000 persons, ranging from about&#13;
10% to about 50% of the total population in the sub-projects. The seventh sub-project, Mahanadi&#13;
Chitrotpala, is not included in the IPDP since the tribal population is only 55 persons, equal to&#13;
0.1% of the total population in the sub-project. Similarly, Naraj barrage replacement involves no&#13;
R&amp;R or impact on indigenous persons. The IPDP, described in Annex 11, is prepared on the&#13;
basis of comprehensive socio-economic surveys which also included an assessment of the&#13;
OWRCP on tribals, their felt needs, and suggested mitigation and community development&#13;
activities to be carried out in each sub-project area.&#13;
2.38      The IPDP supplements other project activities and GOO's ongoing development&#13;
programs for tribals. It contains mitigation measures for tribals negatively affected by the project&#13;
through loss of livelihood and infrastructure, as well as community development activities for&#13;
those tribals who are indirectly or marginally affected. The target group would be tribal&#13;
communities, defined as independent villages or hamlets, and tribal neighborhoods within larger&#13;
mixed caste villages. The target area covers both reservoir area and downstream command areas&#13;
in each sub-project. The duration of the IPDP component would be five years, and&#13;
implementation is scheduled to start at the beginning of fiscal year 1996/97. IPDP activities&#13;
would include: (i) physical infrastructure in the form of community assets (schools, community&#13;
centers, link roads, tube wells, lift irrigation, etc.); (ii) community activities (mixed plantations,&#13;
restoration of grazing land, small check dams, women's groups, functional literacy, etc.); and (iii)&#13;
skills development and capacity building.&#13;
2.39      Implementation would be under DOWR's R&amp;R Directorate with a Special Officer&#13;
IPDP at district level (paras. 4.16 &amp; 4.17). District Collectors and the existing tribal development&#13;
administration would also be involved. NGOs would play a key role as intermediaries between&#13;
the tribal communities and government. NGOs would be directly responsible for implementation&#13;
of most community development activities, and in assisting tribals in obtaining legal rights to their&#13;
ancestral land and habitat, both on an individual ownership basis and as usufructary rights on a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
community basis. IDA funding would be for physical infrastructure and related civil works&#13;
(eligible for reimbursement at 90%), equipment (80%), and consultancies, training, NGO&#13;
contracts and skills development (eligible for reimbursement at 100%). At negotiations, an&#13;
assurance was obtained that the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan would be implemented in a&#13;
manner and timetable satisfactory to IDA. Implementation features above and as fully detailed in&#13;
Annex 1  were also agreed. The IPDP (Annex  1l) will be appended to a supplemental letter to&#13;
be signed along with the legal documents following Board approval.&#13;
D. Policy Reforms&#13;
Policy Reform Program&#13;
2.40      During project preparation, GOO implemented a number of key actions to provide&#13;
the necessary institutional and policy framework to achieve the project's objectives (paras. 1.20 to&#13;
1.22). These included: (i) announcement and commenced implementation of the institutional&#13;
restructuring (para. 2.29) and creation of the new State water planning apparatus (para. 2.17);&#13;
(ii) issuance of a state water policy (para. 2.41); (iii) agreement on re-focused expenditure&#13;
priorities (paras. 2.42 to 2.44); (iv) allocation of full funding of maintenance (paras. 2.45 &amp;&#13;
2.46); (v) establishment of new mechanisms for incorporating environmental concerns into water&#13;
planning and management (para. 2.22); (vi) issuance of a comprehensive State R&amp;R Policy, and&#13;
establishment of the institutional structure for its implementation (paras. 2.33 to 2.36); and (vii)&#13;
forging a new farmer-integrated approach for irrigation investment, O&amp;M and cost recovery&#13;
(paras. 2.14-2.16 &amp; 2.47-2.49). These measures would be followed up in the implementation of&#13;
the OWRCP, as described in the project components above and other features presented below.&#13;
The package of policy and institutional strengthening measures to be implemented under the&#13;
OWRCP has been affirmed by GOO through submission of a Policy Reform Program under a&#13;
Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1).&#13;
2.41      State Water Policy. A crucial output for sustained high quality planning and&#13;
management of water resources beyond project completion has been the finalization, and approval&#13;
(during preparation phase) by Government Order in Sept, 1994, of a State Water Policy for&#13;
Orissa (para. 1.21 and Annex 2). The State Water Policy lays out a framework for articulating&#13;
the State's water plan, for clearly defining institutional responsibilities for the sector, and for&#13;
detailing priority issues and actions. Areas highlighted include: the State's institutional reform&#13;
objectives; multi-sectoral and river basin planning; improving the productivity of existing water&#13;
infrastructure, including stakeholder and farmer participation; preparation of flood, drainage,&#13;
drought, and environmental management plans; and cost recovery based on users paying for&#13;
services and periodic adjustment of water rates.&#13;
Expenditure Prioritization (Annex 21)&#13;
2.42      In line with the recommendations of the India Irrigation Sector Review and the India&#13;
Public Expenditure Review, GOO has undertaken under the OWRCP and beyond, to prioritize&#13;
public expenditures in the water resources sector to ensure better management, financial and&#13;
physical sustainability, and optimal utilization and creation of additional irrigation potential. This&#13;
would include expenditures related to institutional and policy objectives. Expenditures on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
construction would be more sharply focused to emphasize, particularly in the medium term, the&#13;
completion of ongoing projects. GOO proposes to allocate its public expenditures in the&#13;
following order: (i) institutional strengthening to support DOWR reorganization, including&#13;
improving technical capabilities through training and technical assistance; (ii) provision of full&#13;
funding for operations and maintenance of existing facilities; (iii) modernization and rehabilitation&#13;
of existing systems including implementation of the farmer turnover trogram; (iv) completion of&#13;
a manageable number of ongoing projects selected on the basis of viability, to create additional&#13;
potential with the least investment, and (v) limited funding of project construction where&#13;
infrastructure and basic construction facilities have already been taken up.&#13;
2.43      Priorities (i) to (iii) are considered top needs. They would have first call on state&#13;
expenditures, and would be funded to full required levels under any reasonable scenario of the&#13;
State's financial situation. Priority (ii) has already been achieved by GOO (para. 2.45), and&#13;
priorities (i) and (iii) are to be given full funding with Bank financial assistance under the&#13;
OWRCP. For investments under (iv) and (v), preparation and selection would be guided by&#13;
criteria at Annex 15, as well as by the State's water planning activities (Annex 5). The number of&#13;
such investments would be kept to a minimum in view of overall budgetary limitations, to avoid&#13;
the problems of the past of spreading resources including staff capabilities too thinly, and to&#13;
assure full funding of the defined OWRCP objectives. Constituency pressures would always be&#13;
present, necessitating an analytical and institutional capability to review and rank proposals. GOO&#13;
has decided to rank new projects under (iv) in the following order of priority: high priority items&#13;
that would receive full funding are OWRCP-funded schemes, other externally funded projects,&#13;
and flood control; medium priority projects which would be implemented to the extent that funds&#13;
permit; low priority items which would be funded only if funding is available; and items on the&#13;
candidate development list which would receive no allocation of funds in the current budget (refer&#13;
Annex 21, Attachment 1 for 1995/96 allocation).&#13;
2.44      The mechanism for undertaking the expenditure review would be DOWR's Annual&#13;
Review, Action Plan and Budget (ARAPB) exercise which would assess project performance and&#13;
program for future needs (para. 4.06). Supplementing the ARAPB process would be the&#13;
oversight provided by GOO's "High Powered Committee" for DOWR, which is chaired by the&#13;
Chief Secretary, convenes about monthly, and provides the opportunity for interim budget&#13;
adjustments and special scrutiny of particular programs and investment proposals. These two&#13;
mechanisms plus the strengthened programming and budgeting system that were confirmed at&#13;
negotiations, would ensure consistency with the above priorities and provide a mechanism for&#13;
[DA review, while enabling program flexibility as sectoral needs evolve and water planning&#13;
becomes further established. During negotiations the above expenditure priorities, ranking system&#13;
and mechanism for planning and reviewing DOWR's expenditure program were confirmed. GOO&#13;
also provided evidence at negotiations that the Plan Budget allocation for the 1995/96 program&#13;
included specific allocations against OWRCP financed items corresponding to the figures for such&#13;
items tabulated at Attachment I of Annex 21.&#13;
Maintenance Funding&#13;
2.45      GOO has acknowledged the need for the OWRCP's investment in systems&#13;
improvement to be accompanied by a complete revamping of operations and maintenance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
management and full funding of the State's future maintenance needs. To this end, GOO's budget&#13;
allocation to DOWR for operations and maintenance activities has been increased from an average&#13;
of Rs. 198/ha in 1991/92 to an average of Rs. 370/ha in 1994/95, now exceeding the&#13;
Vaidyanathan Committee's average recommendation for India of Rs. 320/ha. Most important is&#13;
the "works" portion of the maintenance budget, which has tended in the past to be seriously&#13;
deficient as salaries have absorbed the bulk of O&amp;M allocations, leaving little for actual physical&#13;
works. Works allocations for a certified ayacut of 718,000 ha have been progressively increased&#13;
since 1992: from Rs. 129/ha in 1992/93, to Rs. 134/ha in 1993/94, Rs. 227/ha in 1994/95, and&#13;
Rs. 229/ha in 1995/96. Budgetary allocations thus satisfy the requirement of raising levels for the&#13;
works component to at least Rs. 200/ha (1994/95 prices) as recommended by Bank missions&#13;
during OWRCP preparation.&#13;
2.46      To ensure the continued priority funding of maintenance in the future, an assurance&#13;
was obtained at negotiations that (OO would: (a) provide annually, starting April 1, 1996, to&#13;
DOWR the funds required for satisfactory maintenance of all DOWR's infrastructure, in order to&#13;
sustain the infrastructure in full operating order (the maintenance works budget would be made&#13;
available from the beginning of the fiscal year so as not to impede maintenance activities); (b)&#13;
continue to allocate maintenance funds to a separate maintenance works budget exempt from&#13;
withdrawals for salaries and wages; and (c) cause DOWR to prepare and submit, starting&#13;
December 31, 1996, its annual maintenance budget estimates to GOO and IDA, based on detailed&#13;
command-by-command estimates following an agreed reporting, programming and budgeting, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation process.&#13;
Water Pricing and Cost Recoverv (Annex 4)&#13;
2.47      In Orissa, expenditures on O&amp;M for surface irrigation systems far outweigh revenues&#13;
obtained from users of the system, resulting in an effective budget subsidy to irrigation on the&#13;
order of about 80%. Two factors account for this imbalance. First, water charges in Orissa are&#13;
among the lowest in India. Though O&amp;M expenditures have increased steadily in the last 12&#13;
years, water charges have remained constant, to the effect that water charges in real terms have&#13;
dropped by 65%. In 1992/93 water charges amounted to just 3 6% of O&amp;M expenditures that&#13;
year. Second, collection rates are only about 40-50% of water charges.11&#13;
2.48      DOWR now provides water services not only for irrigation, but also for bulk water&#13;
supplies to urban domestic users, rural villages, industry, power stations and commercial users,&#13;
drainage services to farmers and to rural communities, and flood control along major rivers. At&#13;
present, cost recovery from all services is significantly less than the cost of provision. GOO and&#13;
DOWR have recognized that future sustainability of the system would require substantial&#13;
increases in water rates assessed on water users. During OWRCP preparation, DOWR raised ten-&#13;
fold the rates for industrial and urban users. Also, in preparation for the series of adjustments&#13;
across different sectoral users to be implemented under the OWRCP, a state model of costs and&#13;
revenues for different water uses in computerized updatable form was prepared by DOWR in&#13;
1995 with the assistance of consultants. The model demonstrated the possibilities available for&#13;
"1 For instance, in 1992/93 expenditures for O&amp;M of major and medium irrigation projects totaled Rs. 231 million, whereas&#13;
expected revenues (based on water rates) totaled Rs. 84 million and actual revenue amounted to Rs. 49 million, a budget&#13;
subsidy to irrigation of Rs. 182 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
increasing the service fees for non-agricultural users; however, as cost recovery for irrigation&#13;
services lags far below that for other services, increased fees to agricultural users were found to&#13;
be an essential and primary component of the annual adjustments to water service fees.&#13;
2.49      To achieve the above objectives a multi-faceted approach would be used, comprising&#13;
(i) a strengthened institutional capability for assessing and annually reviewing costs and fees, (ii)&#13;
increased stakeholder awareness of GOO policy and actions in this area (Annex 14), and (iii)&#13;
linkage of improved service quality (through ensuring adequate funds for maintenance works)&#13;
with increased water rates, improved management by DOWR, and enhanced participation of&#13;
farmers in the management of irrigation systems. Action on maintenance works funding has&#13;
already been taken (para. 2.45). A Water Rates Cost Recovery Committee (WRCRC), which was&#13;
constituted in January 1995 and has held three working sessions since then, would undertake&#13;
periodic review and recommend adjustments to water rates in view of annual maintenance&#13;
requirements, utilizing the cost model developed during project preparation. The WRCRC would&#13;
produce an annual status report detailing progress made toward full cost recovery, including&#13;
findings of studies undertaken, actions taken, and problems faced. Fast track agreement on&#13;
service fees would be part of agreements with farmers for the project's SIFT and scheme&#13;
completions component, including the progressive turnover of O&amp;M functions on selected&#13;
distributaries and minors to water user associations. In its Letter of Development Policy (Annex&#13;
1), GOO has advised that it would enhance water charges by March 3 1, 1996. At negotiations,&#13;
an assurance was obtained from GOO that full recovery of costs from users of operations and&#13;
maintenance activities of the combined water sector (irrigation and drainage, flood control, bulk&#13;
water supply to urban and industrial, etc.) would be achieved progressively with the following&#13;
targeted schedule: 50% cost recovery by March 31, 1997; 80% by March 31, 1998; and 100%&#13;
by March 31, 2000; and that this situation would be maintained thereafter.&#13;
III. COST ESTIMATES. FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
Costs and Financing&#13;
3.01      Program and Project Investment Costs. The OWRCP would contribute to the&#13;
financing of DOWR's overall program during the six-year OWlRCP implementation period.&#13;
DOWR's "Program Costs" comprise the "Project Investment Costs" of the OWRCP, representing&#13;
the project investrnents in physical works and institutional capacity building to which IDA funds&#13;
would contribute, plus DOWR's recurrent expenditures (staffing, O&amp;M costs and other&#13;
overheads, entirely funded by GOO).&#13;
3.02      "Project Investment Costs" would amount to US$345.5 million, including physical&#13;
and price contingencies and US$25.0 million in local taxes and duties. The foreign exchange&#13;
component in project investment costs amounts to US$53.5 million. Project investment costs&#13;
cover: investment expenditures on civil works for systems improvement and scheme completions;&#13;
and, the costs of equipment, facilities, and training/consultancies, for water planning, the&#13;
environmental action plan, research, agricultural intensification activities, institutional&#13;
strengthening, and economic rehabilitation and community development costs associated with the&#13;
R&amp;R and IPDP components. Physical contingencies were applied to baseline costs at the rate of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
15% for civil works, 10% for equipment, vehicles and materials, and zero percent for&#13;
consultancies and training. Applied to the foreign component of costs so as to reflect estimated&#13;
international inflation, price contingencies of 1.5% in 1995, 1 . % in 1996, 2.6%  in 1997, 2.5%&#13;
per annum from 1998 to 2001, and 2.4% in 2002 were used. Likewise for local costs, price&#13;
contingencies were added at 9.0% in 1995, 8.5% in 1996, 8.0% in 1997, 7.0% in 1998, and 6%&#13;
per annum thereafter.&#13;
3.03        Program Costs. The costs of DOWR's overall program also includes DOWR's&#13;
recurrent costs, comprising the costs of operations and maintenance (O&amp;M), staff salaries and&#13;
other overheads, together estimated to cost US$285.6 million including contingencies over the&#13;
OWRCP period. This includes GOO's estimated contribution of US$35 million equivalent and&#13;
farmer's estimated contribution of about US$55 million equivalent for O&amp;M works. DOWR's&#13;
total program under the WERCP thus amounts to US$63 1.1 million, inclusive of physical and price&#13;
contingencies, and including US$45.7 million in local taxes (7% of program costs), and with a&#13;
total foreign exchange component estimated at US$97.8 million (15%  of program costs). 12&#13;

3.05        OWRCP Financing. The proposed IDA Credit of US$290.9 million would be&#13;
confined to financing of the project investment costs of the OWRCP. IDA contribution would be&#13;
12 Other investments may also be made by GOO with its own resources or assisted by external financiers. As such investments&#13;
cannot be accurately estimated, they are excluded from estimated program costs. They would, however, be entirely relevant to&#13;
the Annual Review of DOWR's overall program during OWRCP implementation, as the overall balance of state expenditures&#13;
in the water sector, and its focus on the state's key priorities, are part of the policy understanjdiiig with GOO as elaborated in&#13;
GOO's Letter of Development Policy (Annex I and paras. 2.42 to 2.44).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
46% of program costs (50% exclusive of estimated taxes and duties), or the equivalent of 100%&#13;
of the foreign exchange and 60% of local program costs net of taxes and duties. Farmers would&#13;
contribute US$6.4 mpillion to project investment costs, primarily for on-farm development works.&#13;
GOO's contribution to project investment costs would be US$48.2 million.&#13;

3.06      The Credit would be made available to GOI on standard terms and conditions, and&#13;
on-lent to GOO under standard arrangements for developmental assistance to the states. Under&#13;
current GOI policies and regulations, on-lending to Orissa takes the form of 30% grant/70% loan&#13;
at 12% interest per annum over 20 years. GO1 would assume the foreign exchange risk. At&#13;
negotiations an assurance was obtained that GOI and GOO would implement a system&#13;
satisfactory to IDA for channeling the funds required for the project to the project entities. An&#13;
understanding was also reached at negotiations that GOI would release about three months&#13;
anticipated project expenditures in advance to GOO (in accordance with the amounts established&#13;
in the Annual Action Plans, para. 4.06), and that upon receipt of funds from GOI, GOO would&#13;
transfer such funds, together with its quarterly counterpart contributions, immediately to the&#13;
project accounts of DOWR. The project completion date would be March 31, 2002 and the&#13;
Closing Date of the Credit would be September 30, 2002.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.07      Land (US$13.7 M). This category comprises about 1,799 ha of private lands&#13;
statewide. GOO would finance all land acquisition costs.&#13;
3.08      Civil Works (US$265.0 M). Civil works are scattered throughout the State and are&#13;
primarily for completion works or for rehabilitating and modernizing existing irrigation and&#13;
drainage networks, plus a few small buildings (workshops, training and office space). Except for&#13;
Naraj Barrage and Janivilli Anicut, such works, carried out throughout the life of the project over&#13;
more than 312 locations, would not attract foreign bidders due to their dispersed nature and the&#13;
small size of the individual contracts (e.g. works at each site would average only US$325,000,&#13;
and each site would typically involve individual works scattered throughout the distribution&#13;
system). Therefore, while Naraj Barrage and Janivilli Anicut would be procured following&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB), other works would be procured through national&#13;
competitive bidding (NCB) or direct contracting/force account as follows:&#13;
(a)   ICB (US$50.8 M!. Civil works for Naraj Barrage and Janivilli Anicut would be&#13;
procured through ICB procedures satisfactory to IDA;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
(b)   NCB (US$177.9 M!. Works would be grouped into convenient packages (80% over&#13;
US$100,000 and above) for bidding, and contracts would be awarded on the basis of&#13;
standard NCB documents and following NCB procedures satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
Foreign contractors would be fully eligible to participate;&#13;
(c)   Direct Contracting/Force Account (US$29.9 M). Small scattered civil works&#13;
(including R&amp;R and IPDP works) valued individually at US$20,000 equivalent or less up to&#13;
an aggregate amount not exceeding US$29.9 million, at isolated and inaccessible locations&#13;
which are not suitable for contracting would be procured following procedures acceptable to&#13;
the Association either through Force Account or by Direct Contracting with non-government&#13;
or farmer organizations, or on the basis of quotations solicited from at least three qualified&#13;
contractors. Force Account would include unit rate, piece work and labor contract as&#13;
appropriate. Materials required for these works valued at US$18.0 nillion would be&#13;
procured under national shopping.&#13;
Community participation in works procurement would be iequired under the SIFT&#13;
component to carry out systems improvement of minor/micro distribution and drainage&#13;
networks, and under the R&amp;R and IPDP components (i.e., group income-generating&#13;
programs, community infrastructure, and community activities like small check dams, soil&#13;
conservation, cooperative marketing, village grain banks, fisheries program, etc.).&#13;
Community participation would be carried out through organizations such as: (i) the gram&#13;
panchayats, (ii) village committees, (iii) WUAs, and (iv) local NGOs. In all such cases,&#13;
technical support in the form of preparation of plans or estimates, technical supervision, and&#13;
other required information or technical support, would be provided by staff at bloc or district&#13;
levels under the general direction/supervision of DOWR, including the Directorate R&amp;R.&#13;
(d)   Farmers (US$6.4 M). The bulk of On-Farm Development works (i.e., field channel&#13;
and small drainage systems) would be undertaken directly by farmer organizations, utilizing&#13;
their own funds and labor. Technical assistance would be provided by DOWR where&#13;
necessary.&#13;
For all works procured under NCB/ICB, contractors would be made responsible for procurement&#13;
of all materials including cement and steel. If DOWR supplies any construction material, this&#13;
would be considered as reserved procurement and the estimated cost of such materials would be&#13;
excluded from IDA financing. The civil works would be executed by DOWR, which has&#13;
substantial experience in executing civil works contracts.&#13;
3.09      Equipment. materials and Vehicles (US$32.0 M)&#13;
(a)   Equipment and Materials (US$30.0 million). All contracts for goods, equipment and&#13;
materials costing US$200,000 or more (about US$5.0 million) would be awarded following&#13;
ICB procedures. Other contracts (not exceeding individually US$200,000 and in aggregate&#13;
US$20.0 million) would be awarded following NCB procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Association. Isolated or small lot purchases including, in particular, immediate requirements&#13;
of equipment and materials individually costing the equivalent of US$25,000 or less up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$4.5 million would be procured following national shopping procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
Satellite Imagery/aerial photography valued in aggregate equivalent of US$0.3 million would&#13;
be procured directly from the National Remote Sensing Agency and the Geological Survey of&#13;
India. Books, periodicals and proprietary computer software valued in aggregate equivalent&#13;
of US$0.2 million would be procured on direct contracting basis.&#13;
(b)   Vehicles (US$2.0 M) would consist of cars, jeeps, vans, trucks and motorcycles. All&#13;
contracts for vehicles under the project, each contract indivi(dually not exceeding&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent or less up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$2.0 million,&#13;
would be procured under national shopping procedures. as procurement would irivolve&#13;
different types of vehicles spread over the six year period of the project. Such national&#13;
shopping would primarily involve the use of Director General, Supplies and Disposals&#13;
(DGS&amp;D) rate contracts.&#13;
The Bank's standard bidding documents would be used for all procurement under ICB/NCB. For&#13;
comparing foreign and domestic bids in ICB, the qualifying domestic bidders would be allowed a&#13;
margin of preference in accordance with the provisions of paras. 2.54 and 2.55 of the Bank's&#13;
procurement guidelines (January 1995).&#13;
3.10      Training. Technical Assistance, and Studies (US$21.1 M). Training, technical&#13;
assistance and studies would be for implementation support (US$5.4 M), policy support (US$1.5&#13;
M) and capacity building (US$14.2 M). Specific components comprise: (i) staff training&#13;
including visits within India and overseas (US$9.3 M); (ii) local and foreign consultancies&#13;
(US$5.9 M); (iii) contracts under the Water Resources Research Fund (US$3.7 M); (iv) the&#13;
farmer turnover component (US$0.6 M); (v) applied research and special studies by the CE Plan&#13;
Formulation and Basin Managers and under the Environmental Action Plan (US$0.8 M); and (vi)&#13;
consulting and marketing assistance supporting the project's agricultural intensification objectives&#13;
(US$0.8). Technical Assistance would be contracted on terms and conditions in accordance with&#13;
the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency", published by the Bank in August 1981. Technical assistance (TA) comprises:&#13;
consultancy through a twinning arrangement (para. 4.09), which would provide both technical&#13;
assistance (US$4.0 M out of the TA total above) and access to training (TR) arrangements (about&#13;
US$3.5 M of the TR total above); a small "project monitoring consultancy" (para. 4.19) to assist&#13;
GOO's Project Monitoring Committee (about US$0.6 M of the TA total above); and small&#13;
individual consultancies in particular specialties or as needed. Selection of the twinning&#13;
consultancy would be based on an initial screening and prequalification exercise conducted by&#13;
DOWR, followed by invitation of detailed offers from 3 to 5 interested consulting groups. Other&#13;
technical assistance, training, local consultancies, research grants and contracting to universities&#13;
and NGOs would be arranged by DOWR as per Bank guidelines.&#13;
3.11      NGO Contracts for R&amp;R (US$8.9 M). This category comprises contracts with&#13;
NGOs for implementation assistance for the R&amp;R and IPDP components. For R&amp;R, this includes&#13;
US$6.3 M for contracts with NGOs for providing goods to project-affected persons (PAPs) to&#13;
assist in establishing productive employment (goods might include equipment, transportation,&#13;
farm animals, farm implements, tools, etc.), US$1.9 M for housing construction assistance for&#13;
PDPs, and US$0.5 M for NGO administration services and transportation assistance to PDPs.&#13;
Contracts with NGOs would be arranged by DOWR in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
Disbursements against purchases of goods funded under rehabilitation assistance would be made&#13;
subsequent to eligible expenditures on the basis of supporting documents furnished to the Bank.&#13;
For the IPDP, the contracts include NGO administration services and evaluation during&#13;
implementation of the Plan, totaling US$0 2 M.&#13;
3.12      Incremental Staff and Operating Costs for R&amp;R. IPDP. Water Planning and&#13;
Environmental Management (US$4.8 M!. The credit would not finance operating costs, staff&#13;
salaries and maintenance, which would be financed by GOO and farmers. The only exceptions&#13;
would be in the new areas of R&amp;R, IPDP, water planning and environmental management, where&#13;
investment is required to establish the new units and subsequently build their institutional&#13;
capability. Accordingly, the credit would finance on a declining basis to zero by PY6 (para. 3.16),&#13;
the incremental staff and operating costs for the R&amp;R Directorate (which is also handling the&#13;
IPDP) (US$1.0 M), the Orissa Water Planning Organization (US$2.7 M) and DOWR's&#13;
Environmental Units (US$ 1.1 M).&#13;
3.13      Review of Contracts. All contracts for civil works valued at US$300,000 and above&#13;
and for goods and equipment valued at US$200,000 and above, all consultancy contracts valued&#13;
at US$100,000 and above (US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultants) and all single source&#13;
consultancy contracts over US$1 00,000 equivalent, as well as the first five contracts under each&#13;
of the works, goods and consultancy categories irrespective of the values, would be subjected to&#13;
prior IDA review. All other contracts would be subject to random post review in the field by&#13;
visiting missions. This would result in about 50% of the project procurement being subject to&#13;
prior review. GOO has had prior experience with Bank procurement procedures. DOWR is&#13;
currently undergoing training in Bank procurement practices and has established a specialist&#13;
procurement unit in DOWR to handle bid and contract documentation. GOO has also decided to&#13;
implement special monitoring and managerial procedures for procurement which are acceptable to&#13;
IDA (para. 3.14), and which were confirmed at negotiations. These measures are expected to&#13;
ensure both quality and timeliness of procurement, and a higher level of formal reviews by IDA is&#13;
not expected to be necessary.&#13;
3.14      Procurement Management. To expedite procurement and tighten procurement&#13;
monitoring and management, an understanding on the following procedures for the OWRCP's&#13;
procurement were recorded at negotiations:&#13;
(i)   Except where may be specifically agreed by IDA (for Naraj Barrage, Janivilli Annicut&#13;
and other needs as may be determined), prequalification procedures would not be used;&#13;
(ii)   As a minimum, all bid invitations would be advertised in newspapers with national&#13;
circulation and shall contain in summary form the post-qualification requirements. Bid&#13;
documents shall be provided promptly upon request, upon payment of the prescribed fee, and&#13;
shall be sent by mail upon request,&#13;
(iii) Bids shall be evaluated, contract award approvals sought and granted (including that&#13;
of IDA, where required) and contracts signed, all within the bid validity period, and a&#13;
justification for any exceptions shall be forwarded to IDA;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
(iv)    DOWR would designate (or retain) a suitably qualified individual(s) (the Evaluator)&#13;
to prepare a signed and dated Bid Evaluation Report (BER), following a format and content&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The BER would be prepared as expeditiously as practicable;&#13;
(v)     GOO would maintain its Empowered Committee for Procurement Management&#13;
(ECPM) for the OWRCP (established August 1995), with constitution acceptable to IDA,&#13;
authorized by GOO to award the contract (subject where required to approval by IDA prior&#13;
to award, para. 3.13). The BER shall be submitted to the ECPM within seven working days&#13;
of its completion. ECPM members would sign a dated minutes of their proceedings and&#13;
decisions which would be kept on file, for possible review by IDA and, where required, also&#13;
farnished promptly to IDA for approval along with the BER. The ECPM (refer Letter of&#13;
Development Policy) is chaired by the Principal Secretary DOWR and comprises the&#13;
Secretary Finance, Secretary Law, EIC DOWR, and Financial Advisor-cum-Joint Secretary&#13;
DOWR as Member-Secretary; and&#13;
(vi)     DOWR's quarterly reports (para. 4.05) would contain summarized procurement data&#13;
including for each contract, the dates of bid invitation, receipt, evaluation, approval and&#13;
signing, and the names of contractors bidding, offer prices, and firm awarded the contract.&#13;
3.15         The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below:&#13;

Disbursement&#13;
3.16      The proceeds of the Credit would be disbursed against:&#13;
(a)   90% of expenditures on civil works;&#13;
(b)   100% of foreign expenditures or 100% of local ex-factory costs or 80% of other&#13;
local costs of equipment, vehicles and materials;&#13;
(c)   100% of expenditures on consultants' (including NGOs) services, training and&#13;
studies; and&#13;
(d)   for the R&amp;R, IPDP, water planning and environme,ntal action plan components,&#13;
90% of incremental staff salaries and allowances, and operating and maintenance&#13;
costs, covering the period to March 31, 1998 (end PY2), 75% through March 31,&#13;
1999 (PY3), 50% through March 31, 2001 (PY5) and zero thereafter.&#13;
3.17      Disbursements against civil works contracts exceeding US$300,000 equivalent,&#13;
vehicles, equipment and materials contracts exceeding US$200,000 equivalent, the first five&#13;
contracts of each goods and civil works, and consultancy and training contracts exceeding&#13;
US$100,000, would be fully documented (for individual consultants the limit would be&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent). For all other expenditures, disbursement could be against Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documents for SOEs would not be submitted to IDA, but&#13;
would be retained by GOO and made available to IDA staff during supervision. Disbursements&#13;
against the NGO contracts for R&amp;R would exclude the maintenance allowance (para. 2.36) which&#13;
would be funded by GOO (US$0.6 million). The Schedule of Disbursements is at Annex 20.&#13;
Retroactive Financing and Special Account&#13;
3.18      DOWR has already commenced field activities related to the OWRCP to expedite&#13;
project start-up. To reimburse GOO for such expenditures, retroactive financing would be&#13;
applied to all eligible expenditures incurred after January 15, 1995, provided that procurement&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA were followed. Since October 1, 1994 DOWR has used Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines. The total amount of retroactive financing would amount to up to US$14&#13;
million or about 5% of the Credit. To facilitate project implementation and to reduce the volume&#13;
of withdrawal applications, a Special Account in US dollars would be established in the Reserve&#13;
Bank of India with an authorized allocation of up to US$10 million. This deposit is based on&#13;
estimates of the project's financing needs and projected IDA disbursements (Annex 20).&#13;
Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.19      Project accounts, maintained by DOWR, would identify all project transactions on an&#13;
ongoing basis, including contributions from farmers, GOO, GOI, and the Credit. At negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained from GOI and GOO that: (i) project accounts, including the Special&#13;
Account, would be maintained and audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards&#13;
consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to IDA; and (ii) certified&#13;
copies of the annual financial statements and SOEs together with the auditors report, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
would comment separately on the SOEs, would be submitted to IDA not later than nine months&#13;
after the close of each GOO fiscal year (April I to March 31).&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING&#13;
Implementation, Organization and Management&#13;
4.01      Implementation. The project would be implemented by Orissa's Department of Water&#13;
Resources (DOWR). As the project and its contributing IDA and State funds are supporting the&#13;
overall program of DOWR, project years, project monitoring and physical and financial planning&#13;
fit in with the GOO fiscal year (April 1 to March 31). Implementation would be over a six year&#13;
period from April 1, 1996 to March 31, 2002 (1995/96 would be project year zero (PYO) and&#13;
PY6 would be 2001/02). The start-up activities in 1994/95 and PYO activities prior to signature&#13;
would be eligible for retroactive financing after January 15, 1995 (para. 3.18). Implementation&#13;
arrangements are in the Implementation and Supervision Plan at Annex 22, which were confirmed&#13;
at negotiations. The annex includes an Implementation Schedule, Implementation&#13;
Responsibilities, Procurement Schedule, IDA Supervision Schedule, and Monitorable Indicators&#13;
of Development Impact at Attachments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.&#13;
4.02      Organization and Management. The Secretary-DOWR would have overall&#13;
responsibility for project performance and would be supported by an Additional Secretary who&#13;
would also head the new Directorate for Resettlement and Rehabilitation. The day to day project&#13;
management would be the responsibility of the Engineer-in-Chief (EIC) of DOWR, who would&#13;
coordinate the implementation of all project activities, assisted by an Additional EIC. They would&#13;
be supported by CEs or Directors responsible for DOWR's respective management units.&#13;
DOWR's new organizational structure is at Annex 3. State-level supervision of the project would&#13;
be through a Project Monitoring Committee, assisted by consultants (para. 4.18). For state water&#13;
planning and allocation decisions, the new Water Resources Board chaired by the Chief Secretary&#13;
(paras. 1.21 and 2.17) would have overarching responsibility, with DOWR's Water Planning&#13;
Organization as its technical Secretariat. Prior to negotiations, GOO issued Government Orders&#13;
for the reorganization of DOWR and placement of staff to key positions.&#13;
Monitoring. Evaluation. Programming and Budgeting&#13;
4.03      DOWR's Monitoring, Evaluation, Programme, Budget &amp; Accounts (MEPB&amp;A)&#13;
Unit, headed by a Director who would report directly to the EIC, would assist the EIC and GOO&#13;
in assessing program progress and performance, and in guiding the expenditure program.&#13;
MEPB&amp;A (refer Annex 3 for organizational structure) would submit reports to the EIC on a&#13;
quarterly and annual basis (paras. 4.05 and 4.06). A sub-unit of MEPB&amp;A, headed by a Deputy&#13;
Director, would develop and maintain a computerized Management Information System (MIS) to&#13;
support all activities in DOWR. Consultancy assistance would be used to guide the establishment&#13;
and initial operation of the Unit, and as needed thereafter. A new Programme. Budget and&#13;
Accounts (PB&amp;A) sub-unit at Deputy Director level would establish, maintain, and administer the&#13;
financial management systems including program, budget and cost allocation/accounting systems.&#13;
The system would be used to develop annual budgets by consolidating budget requests from all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
DOWR organizational units and to ensure that the final budget request is consistent with the&#13;
policies and instructions from GOO. Each management or operational unit would be responsible&#13;
for providing PB&amp;A with required information and estimates. PB&amp;A would use this to produce&#13;
management reports that would track program progress.&#13;
4.04      A new Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) sub-unit at Deputy Director level would:&#13;
(i) monitor expenditures on programs relative to total estimated costs; (ii) provide macro-level&#13;
information on progress and benefits of ongoing and completed projects; and (iii) evaluate&#13;
organizational effectiveness and performance of DOWR's management units. Indicators&#13;
monitored would include: institutional strengthening, staff training and development; physical&#13;
progress and quality/capacity improvements by all units; delivery of water, improved services and&#13;
water distribution efficiency; quality of annual maintenance; farmer participation and turnover,&#13;
cost recovery; crop yields, crop diversification, total crop production and impact on farm&#13;
incomes (monitoring of R&amp;R wouid be handled by the R&amp;R Directorate, with evaluations by&#13;
independent consultants). The remote sensing capability to be built up in OWPO would be one of&#13;
the tools used to monitor water management and some crop data. In addition to its regular data&#13;
source (PB&amp;A), M&amp;E would use independent consultant surveys as needed. This would include&#13;
a Baseline Survey (TOR at Annex 17) covering agricultural data, household income and socio-&#13;
economic data, existing irrigation performance and water use. This would be undertaken in PYI&#13;
with the assistance of consultants, as a basis for future monitoring and performance evaluation.&#13;
At negotiations, the TOR for the base!ine survey, including agreement on its completion by&#13;
September 30, 1996, was confirmed. Additional assessments on specialist aspects of the project&#13;
would be available from independent agencies funded under the project's Water Resources&#13;
Research Fund (para. 2.23).&#13;
Project Reviews and Reporting&#13;
4.05      An action-oriented review, planning and budgeting process would be the pivotal&#13;
feature of the project's management (Annex 22, paras. 18-27). This would take the form of short&#13;
quarterly progress reports and a comprehensive Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget&#13;
(ARAPB , both prepared by the MEPB&amp;A Unit. An annual status report prepared by the Water&#13;
Rates Cost Recovery Committee (WRCRC) would inform on progress regarding achieving full&#13;
cost recovery of O&amp;M expenditures, including its recommendations for action in the succeeding&#13;
year. T he quarterly progress reports would be produced in standard format and would track the&#13;
project by its individual components, including physical and financial progress, procurement, and&#13;
disbursement. The reports would incorporate brief submissions from each implementation unit in&#13;
DOWR which would quantify and compare progress with agreed targets in the SAR and the&#13;
previous ARAPB, and would highlight key issues including problems and constraints. An&#13;
overview with summarized data and a listing of decisions taken or recommended, based on each&#13;
unit's submission, would be prepared by the EIC's office. This would include commentary on the&#13;
status of decisions/actions outstanding from the last quarterly report, and review of&#13;
decisions/actions still required related to recommendations of the GOO Project Monitoring&#13;
Committee (para. 4.18), GOI or IDA. The reports would be presented to the Secretary DOWR&#13;
and copied to the Project Monitoring Committee, relevant State officials, GOI and IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
4.06      The Annual Review. Action Plan and Budget (ARAPB) would be the main vehicle for&#13;
annual review of project performance and future needs, for adjusting DOWR's program as&#13;
needed, for budgeting by GOO of DOWR' s Plan and non-Plan expenditures, for assessing&#13;
progress and determining follow-on actions regarding cost recovery and expenditure prioritization&#13;
policies, and for major review and supervision by COO, GOI and IDA. For DOWR it would&#13;
provide annual opportunity to assess its overall program, to propose adjustments as needed and to&#13;
present its consolidated plan and justification for financing needs for the forthcoming year. The&#13;
ARAPB would review for each component and responsible unit the past year's achievements in&#13;
terms of development indicators (para. 4.04 &amp; Annex 22, Attachment 5), physical targets and&#13;
expenditure, and would propose a justified work program and expenditure budget for the&#13;
forthcoming fiscal year. This would include: (i) description of each year's works, schedule of&#13;
activities, staffing requirements and distribution of responsibilities, (ii) proposed expenditures for&#13;
the next fiscal year compared with the past year's actual expenditures and the budgeted and&#13;
expected expenditures of the current year; (iii) details on major civil works contracts exceeding&#13;
US$300,000, and equipment and vehicle contracts exceeding US$200,000; and (iv) a financing&#13;
plan and source of funds. Special sections would cover: (v) review of implementation progress&#13;
related to the institutional strengthening and policy reforms under the project; (vi) detailed review&#13;
and proposal of maintenance needs and corresponding non-Plan expenditure requirements (paras.&#13;
2.45 &amp; 2.46(a)); (vii) progress with the farmer participation and turnover program; (viii)&#13;
progress of State water planning; and (ix) actions and progress with the cost recovery objective.&#13;
4.07      At negotiations, the above project review and reporting arrangements were&#13;
confirmed, including specific assurances related to the following: (i) a draft annual review, action&#13;
plan and funding proposal for the forthcoming GOO fiscal year, including analysis of expenditure&#13;
priorities, would be submitted to IDA for review and comment by October 31 each year,&#13;
commencing October 1996. The 60-approved ARAPB, taking account of IDA comments,&#13;
would subsequently be forwarded to IDA by the following April 15, and DOWR would&#13;
subsequently implement the agreed action plan, with funding in accordance with the agreed&#13;
budget provided in timely fashion by GOO, and (ii) not later than March 31, 1999 (end PY3),&#13;
GOO would carry out a detailed mid-term review of project progress and possible need for&#13;
adjustments to components, implementation arrangements and policy reforms, and thereafter&#13;
implement its recommendations. The mid-term review would include an assessment of the ability&#13;
of the State to finance GOO's contributions to the OWRCP.&#13;
Training and Technical Assistance (Annex 13)&#13;
4.08      The major initiatives in the areas of institutional strengthening, water planning, farmer&#13;
participation, environmental management, business skills such as MIS and P&amp;B, as well as&#13;
upgrading in all engineering skills, would require substantial training and technical assistance&#13;
throughout the new DOWR. Training and consultancy needs have been prepared by DOWR and&#13;
the Bank for each management unit and are detailed in the project cost tables at Annex 18. Each&#13;
CE would be responsible for managing the specific training and consultancy relevant to his&#13;
management unit, but would receive administrative support from the Training and Technical&#13;
Assistance officer in the EIC's office. The EIC would provide general guidance and would&#13;
balance needs between DOWR units. Training would focus on strengthening skills in all&#13;
engineering areas including O&amp;M, water planning, environmental management, design and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
construction, and on supporting skill development associated with technologies or management&#13;
techniques relatively new to DOWR (for instance, financial management, programming and&#13;
budgeting, critical path scheduling, computerization, computer aided design, remote sensing and&#13;
management information systems). To allow for the transfer of skills and expertise from&#13;
consultants to DOWR staff, technical assistance would be linked in all cases to staff training&#13;
through association of staff with consultant assignments and inter-linked formal training as&#13;
practicable. National and international study tours and temporary assignments would also be used&#13;
to provide first-hand exposure to new technologies and management techniques.&#13;
4.09      Consultancy arrangements would include small consultancies with individuals or&#13;
firms, in addition to a twinning arrangement throughout the project period with an experienced&#13;
consultancy group. All consultancy selection would follow Bank guidelines. The twinning&#13;
arrangement is expected to be a consortium of several firms or specialist institutions, including&#13;
one international and one local firm. The central skill areas, seldom found in one firmn or agency,&#13;
would likely comprise all aspects of irrigation engineering, water planning, environrnental&#13;
management, and hands-on irrigation agency management, particularly in O&amp;M, construction,&#13;
general management techniques and beneficiary participation, plus capacity to provide or arrange&#13;
training in all of the above areas. The international firm would be the lead partner and would have&#13;
overall responsibility for mobilizing the consultancy and training support required. The contract&#13;
would provide for basic expertise and training input annually, including core senior staff providing&#13;
continuity of visits, and access to other specializations and training on an as needed basis, with&#13;
flexibility retained and provided for in the consultancy budget of the contract. Selection would be&#13;
through an initial prequalification of interested firms, which would advise of any intended&#13;
partners, followed by a short listing by DOWR of 3 to 5 firms or groups of firms for submission&#13;
of detailed offers. A contract over the project period would be agreed at the outset, with&#13;
flexibility for annual variations based on an annual review of consultancy and related training&#13;
needs between DOWR and the consortium in consultation with IDA. The above procedures&#13;
would provide the expertise required while limiting constraints frequently found in India of&#13;
obtaining individual clearances, especially for consultants and training reauiring foreign exchange.&#13;
At negotiations, the above consultancy and training arrangements were confirmed. Suitably&#13;
qualified and experienced NGOs would be recruited for implementation of the R&amp;R Action Plans&#13;
(RAPs) (para. 2.36) and IPDPs (para. 2.39), and as community organizers for farmer participation&#13;
and turnover (para. 4.10). An assurance was obtained at negotiations that any NGOs contracted&#13;
under the project would be selected according to criteria (Annex 16) agreed with IDA.&#13;
Management of Farmer Organization and Turnover (Annex 6)&#13;
4.10      Responsibility for implementing the FOT program rests with DOWR, which would&#13;
utilize the resources of its WALMI department and draw on the assistance of other organizations&#13;
as necessary. A senior consultant attached to the CE for Water Services would coordinate the&#13;
FOT program during Phase I and monitor progress made. Based on experience acquired during&#13;
Phase 1, the consultant would propose any necessary corrective measures and the FOT approach&#13;
would be adjusted and expanded to cover additional project locations during Phases 2 and 3 (18&#13;
locations covering 135,000 ha have been provisionally identified for purposes of project planning&#13;
and costing). Junior Engineers (JEs), who would have responsibility for facilitating the&#13;
establishment and legal registration of WUAs, would be supported by several types of specialists:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
mobile extension units staffed by WALMI, social organizers, and NGOs. In each Phase-I project&#13;
location. an NGO would be recruited on a contract basis to organize farmer associations within a&#13;
particular minor. Agreement has been reached with WALMI regarding a series of training&#13;
activities. The preliminary phase of training, already underway, would orient DOWR staff and&#13;
NGOs in anticipation of project implementation. Most of the training during implementation&#13;
would be aimed at JEs, and farmer association leaders to provide the range of skills required for&#13;
their new functions. The FOT program includes provision for national and international training&#13;
and study tours.&#13;
4.11      The farmer organization and turnover program would be intensively monitored and&#13;
evaluated throughout the OWRCP period, incorporating lessons learned from experience. This&#13;
would commence with a targeted survey in PY I to assess the state of affairs on specific criteria&#13;
and to refine M&amp;E criteria to ensure meaningful qualitative indicators of impact (Annex 22,&#13;
Attachment 5). A special review of the farmer organization and turnover program by independent&#13;
consultants would be undertaken at the end of PY2 (by March 31, 1998), sufficiently early in&#13;
project implementation to enable timely adjustment, or scaling back of the component, as needed.&#13;
The OWRCP's annual reviews (para. 4.06) would also have a special section on this component.&#13;
The above arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
Management of Agricultural Intensification Program (Annex 9)&#13;
4.12      The Agricultural Intensification Program (ALP) would be administered and funded&#13;
through DOWR. Responsibility for implementing the AIP at field level would lie primarily with&#13;
DOA, using its own budgetary and staff resources within the limits of its normal budgetary and&#13;
staff resources. DOA would, however, draw on DOWR and its WALMI wing as needed, and&#13;
would obtain supplemental budgetary support through DOWR. The responsibilities of DOA, in&#13;
conjunction with the OUAT, would be to take a proactive role in identifying and conducting&#13;
problem-solving research, and promoting technology transfer in irrigation agronomy. Training of&#13;
agricultural extension staff to upgrade their professional competence in irrigated farming and&#13;
training of farmers in water management, fertilizer application, crop planning, plant protection,&#13;
farm mechanization and post harvest technology, would be organized by OAUT, WALMI, and&#13;
CRRI. DOWR would provide timely advice to the farmers and DOA on system operational plans&#13;
indicating start and cutoff dates for irrigation, and water availability in each irrigation scheme,&#13;
well before the start of the irrigation season.&#13;
4.13      Implementation, including phasing and locations, would be closely linked to the FOT&#13;
program (paras. 2.14-2.15, 4. 10 and 4. 11). Initial activities would thus be concentrated in 3 of&#13;
the 25 SIFT commands during the first two years of the project. Based on the lessons learnt&#13;
during these years in the pilot scheme areas, the program would be suitably modified and&#13;
gradually expanded to cover other commands. Intensive monitoring of the AIP would be&#13;
undertaken, in conjunction with the FOT program, by a special multi-disciplinary committee in&#13;
DOWR chaired by the Secretary, DOWR and comprising members representing CE-Water&#13;
Services, WALMI, DOA, OUAT, and CRRI. A special cell would be established in DOA to&#13;
assist the Director of Agriculture to monitor implementation of the AIP. The baseline survey&#13;
(para. 4.04 and Annex 17) in PYI would allow refinement of the M&amp;E criteria to ensure&#13;
meaningful qualitative indicators of impact. A special review of the AIP would be undertaken by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
independent consultants at the end of PY2, and adjustments made, as needed, prior to wider&#13;
implementation on other schemes as the FOT program gains momentum. The OWRCP's annual&#13;
reviews (para. 4.06) would also have a special section on this component. The above&#13;
arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
Management of Resettlement and Rehabilitation (Annex 10)&#13;
4.14      DOWR's R&amp;R Directorate, established in March, 1994, is accountable directly to the&#13;
Secretary of DOWR, and has responsibility for planning, coordination, implementation, and&#13;
monitoring of all land acquisition and R&amp;R of project-affected persons (PAPs). As coordination&#13;
of R&amp;R requires steerage at a senior level, this is headed by an Additional Secretary. At each site,&#13;
NGOs would be contracted for implementation of the RAPs and IPDPs. Responsibilities also&#13;
include preparation and funding of the socio-economic surveys and scheme-level RAPs, and&#13;
monitoring of environmental protection and management related to R&amp;R. The R&amp;R Directorate&#13;
would be assisted by consultants, NGOs, and separate independent consultancy arrangements for&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of field impact and benefits (monitorable indicators are at Annex 10,&#13;
Attachment 7). An organigram of the Directorate is contained in Annex 10, Attachment 3, and an&#13;
implementation schedule for R&amp;R is at Annex 10, Attachment 2.&#13;
4.15      At the field level, the Directorate would have an R&amp;R Officer (RRO) and a Special&#13;
Land Acquisition Officer (SLAO) assigned to every major irrigation scheme. An NGO or&#13;
Community Organizer would assist each RRO or SLAO on a contract basis with resettlement and&#13;
economic rehabilitation of the PAPs, at a ratio of one community worker for every 250 displaced&#13;
or project-affected persons. The NGO would have the main responsibility of (i) informing&#13;
individual PAPs of their entitlements under the 1994 R&amp;R policy, (ii) ensuring the participation of&#13;
PAPs in the planning process and informing PAPs of resettlement schedules and plans, (iii)&#13;
ensuring that physical resettlement respects rights and dignities, and (iv) informing PAPs of&#13;
alternative economic rehabilitation opportunities and of agencies and resources which they can&#13;
access to help them in restoring their standard of living. These arrangements and other features at&#13;
paras. 2.33 to 2.36 were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
Management of Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (Annex  11)&#13;
4.16      DOWR's R&amp;R Directorate would have overall responsibility for IPDP&#13;
implementation and coordination of the various parties involved. The Directorate would: (i)&#13;
approve annual plans prepared at village and sub-project/district level; (ii) release funds to&#13;
districts; (iii) approve NGO and consultant contracts; (iv) arrange staff and NGO training; (v)&#13;
be responsible for monitoring and evaluation; (vi) prepare material and procedures for orientation&#13;
and local public consultation. The Directorate would be strengthened by a Special Officer IPDP&#13;
who would assist the Director in the above responsibilities. The Director would report to a state-&#13;
level IPDP Sub-Comrnittee chaired by the DOWR Principal Secretary and with representation&#13;
from the Tribal Development Administration. An organigram of the Directorate is contained in&#13;
Annex 10, Attachment 3, and its responsibilities in relation to the IPDP is explained in Annex 11,&#13;
para. 41 and Table 2. An implementation schedule for the IPDP is presented at Annex 1 1,&#13;
Attachment 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
4.17      At sub-project and district level the IPDP would be implemented as a Special Project&#13;
under the Integrated Tribal Development Authority (ITDA) with its own separate budget and&#13;
accounts. A Special Officer IPDP would be posted in each of the four projects under ITDA to be&#13;
responsible for coordination, consolidation of annual district plans, monitoring, flow of funds to&#13;
NGOs and implementing agencies at block level. The Special Officer would report to a Project-&#13;
Level Committee, chaired by the District Collector, to be established in each district. The&#13;
Committee would approve annual activity plans and budgets. In all six sub-projects, NGOs would&#13;
be contracted for: (i) baseline survey and PRA at village level; (ii) establishment, training and&#13;
capacity building of village committees; (iii) participatory village level planning and inputs to&#13;
district plans; and (iv) implementation and monitoring of community activities. NGOs would be&#13;
identified by the R&amp;R Directorate and would sign agreements with the District Collector or the&#13;
R&amp;R Directorate. Two third-party evaluations of the impact and benefits of the project would be&#13;
carried out by independent consultants during the project period. These arrangements and other&#13;
details spelled out in Annex 11, paras. 41 to 45 were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
Project Supervision (Annex 22)&#13;
4.18      By integrating creation of management information and programming and budgeting&#13;
specialties in the OWRCP (paras. 4.03 to 4.04), the capabilities of DOWR to program and&#13;
monitor its activities would be strengthened. The reporting arrangements above are also designed&#13;
to facilitate monitoring by GOO, GOI and IDA, and to provide a mechanism for integrating&#13;
adjustments in quarterly and annual action programs. IDA support (Supervision Schedule at&#13;
Annex 22, Attachment 4) would typically comprise a main supervision mission annually at time of&#13;
ARAPB review (para. 4.06), supplemented by a shorter mid-year visi.t, and correspondence and&#13;
clearances as needed. In view of the institutional and technical challenges to be undertaken under&#13;
the project, GOO intends to undertake a close monitoring and supervision role itself, assisted by&#13;
consultants. This would be through a state-level "Project Monitoring Committee" (PMC) chaired&#13;
by the Chief Secretary GOO with membership comprising the Development Commissioner and&#13;
Secretaries of DOWR, Revenue &amp; Excise, Finance, Agriculture, Forest &amp; Environment, Welfare&#13;
(R&amp;R), and the EIC as Member Secretary. Two to three additional non-government members&#13;
with relevant qualifications and experience (former staff of DOWR, other Government agency or&#13;
business community/NGO) would be included on the PMC. Additionally, there would be a state-&#13;
level sub-committee of the PMC headed by the Principal Secretary DOWR to provide hands-on&#13;
monitoring and supervision of OWRCP implementation.&#13;
4.19      The PMC would meet at least quarterly to review DOWR's quarterly reports (para.&#13;
4.05). The committee would arrange a "Project Monitoring Consultancy" through a contract with&#13;
a national consultancy firm, which would assist the committee in the periodic review and&#13;
assessment of the project as a whole. The consultants would make two visits annually, timed to&#13;
overlap with IDA supervision missions, and would provide additional support as requested by the&#13;
Committee. Consultant reports would be made available to the Project Monitoring Committee,&#13;
GOI and IDA. Costs of the consultancy would be reimbursable under the Credit. The Project&#13;
Monitoring Committee was established prior to negotiations. The above arrangements were&#13;
confirmed at negotiations and an assurance obtained that the Project Monitoring Committee&#13;
would be maintained for the duration of the project, with composition and responsibilities&#13;
satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
V. BENEFITS. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
5.01      The project through its policy, capacity building, and investment actions, would assist&#13;
Orissa to lay the foundation for sustainable management of its water resources and for future&#13;
economic growth particularly in the agricultural sector. Along with associated institutional and&#13;
operational measures to improve the quality of maintenance services (paras. 2.11 to 2.13), the&#13;
maintenance funding policy (paras. 2.45 and 2.46) in conjunction with the SIFT program would&#13;
ensure improved reliability and equitable distribution of water to 50% of the State's post-project&#13;
major and medium scheme command area. This would provide stability (and/or availability of&#13;
water) to millions of farmers, enabling improvement in farming practices, better use of fertilizer&#13;
and other inputs, multiple cropping of agricultural lands, adoption of higher yielding crop&#13;
varieties, and diversification of agricultural production (para. 5.06). Benefits would also accrue&#13;
to landless rural families in the form of enhanced agricultural employment opportunities (para.&#13;
5.19). Adequate funding of maintenance would also benefit the remaining half of the State's post-&#13;
project DOWR canal-command areas not included in the project's systems improvement&#13;
component by increasing reliability of water delivered to farmers.&#13;
5.02      Two additional policies that would benefit farmers would also impact positively on&#13;
the financial sustainability of the water resources sector and the State government. By limiting the&#13;
number of concurrent new irrigation projects to ensure their adequate funding to completion, the&#13;
expenditure prioritization measures (paras. 2.42 to 2.44 and Annex 21) in addition to protecting&#13;
funding for maintenance, would benefit increasing numbers of the State's presently rainfed&#13;
farmers and make available to them the benefits detailed above (para. 5.01). The three-pronged&#13;
cost recovery strategy (para. 2.49) would benefit farners by establishing a just system of payment&#13;
(one based on quality of services received) and by providing them the opportunity to bear lower&#13;
costs of water services through formation of user associations and assumption of responsibilities&#13;
for management of O&amp;M.&#13;
5.03      Creation of a policy and institutional apparatus for implementing resettlement and&#13;
economic rehabilitation (R&amp;R) in the water sector would have significant beneficial impacts for all&#13;
OWRCP project-affected persons (PAPs), and create a permanent state-level capacity for future&#13;
R&amp;R (paras. 2.33 to 2.39, 4.14 to 4.17, and Annexes 10 &amp; I 1). As described at Annex 10 paras.&#13;
38 to 46, the provisions provided under the R&amp;R program, including special provisions for the&#13;
landless, encroachers, women and tribals, would enable all PAPs (including project displaced&#13;
persons (PDPs)) to be net beneficiaries from the R&amp;R program, thereby experiencing enhanced&#13;
incomes. About 75% of PAPs/PDPs are estimated to also be direct beneficiaries of new&#13;
irrigation, which would further augment their incomes. The new institutional structure and&#13;
provisions under the OWRCP's Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (paras. 2.37 to 2.39 &amp;&#13;
Annex 11) would provide additional enhancements for the special socio-economic and community&#13;
needs of tribal populations.&#13;
5.04      Considerable other non-quantifiable benefits would be generated by transforming&#13;
Orissa's construction-oriented Department of Water Resources (DOWR) into a comprehensive water&#13;
resources agency capable of addressing basin planning and environmental issues, of analytically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
rigorous selection of new investment projects (Annex 15), and of fostering participation of&#13;
beneficiaries. Conjunctive planning of surface and groundwater resources, and allocation of water&#13;
amnong varied users, would be rationalised through improved planning procedures and more efficient&#13;
water pricing policies. This would improve efficiency of water utilisation, and enhance sustainability of&#13;
physical infrastructure, natural resources and the environment.&#13;
5.05      Scheme Completions. Benefits are primarily from higher yields and increased&#13;
irrigation intensity, with unquantified likely benefits from diversification to higher value, more&#13;
water-sensitive crops. Seven of the eight selected scheme completions would augment the State's&#13;
irrigated area by 67,000 ha and produce an incremental agricultural output valued at about Rs. 980&#13;
million (US$30 million). Provision of irrigation would ensure the reliability of water supply to&#13;
previously rainfed crops during the kharif, and the availability of water in the rabi which would enable&#13;
expanded cultivation as well as diversification to new crops. Agricultural yields and irrigation intensity&#13;
would also increase. About 151.000 farm families would directly benefit from the investment,&#13;
experiencing on average income improvements of Rs. 12,350/ha. Completion of the eighth scheme,&#13;
Naraj Barrage, would (a) prevent loss of irrigation to about 200,000 ha in Cuttack district and severe&#13;
flooding, in downstream areas in Puri district, that would ensue if the existing weir were to fail; (b)&#13;
control flood flows so that flood damage in the Puri district, which currently occurs almost yearly,&#13;
would be avoided in nine out of ten years; and (c) protect Chilika Lake's environment through&#13;
additional controls to reduce siltation and manage its brackish water ecology. The livelihoods and&#13;
incomes of about 455,000 families would be protected due to the Naraj investment.&#13;
5.06      Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover. In addition to increases in agricultural&#13;
production, the SIFT activities would: (a) prevent reductions in agricultural production resulting from&#13;
continual degradation of the schemes in absence of the improvements; (b) save on O&amp;M costs that&#13;
would be incurred without the project; (c) reduce expenditures on repairing canal breaches; (d)&#13;
improve canal safety; and (e) reduce flood damage to crops resulting from canal breaches. Total&#13;
benefits deriving from these items (including increased agricultural production) are estimated to&#13;
amount to Rs. 520 million at project completion and to increase thereafter to over Rs. 680 million&#13;
twenty years after project completion. About 265,400 ha of irrigated land (34% of the State's irrigated&#13;
land) on 25 schemes would benefit from the SIFT prograrm, including 8 ex-NWMP schemes. For 17&#13;
schemes for which benefits were valued, improvements in system performance to increase reliability&#13;
and equity of water supplies, would ensure full irrigation in the khariff to the entire 155,600 ha (an&#13;
increase of 100% over current coverage), and would increase the area receiving full service in the rabi&#13;
from 30,400 ha to 60,400 ha. Overall, the annual value of crop output would increase by Rs. 250&#13;
million (US$8 million). Benefits by farmily would vary depending on the existing status of irrigation in&#13;
the command and the family's location in the command. Tail-end farmers currently receiving no&#13;
irrigation would benefit the most, followed by farmers in middle reaches currently experiencing&#13;
unreliable or no supplies. On average, estimated farmer incomes would increase by about Rs. 3045/ha&#13;
net of costs, representing a 44% improvement.&#13;
Economic and Financial Analysis (Annex 19)&#13;
5.07      The economic analysis focuses primarily on quantifying the impact of the scheme&#13;
completions (SC) and SIFT components on agricultural production. Other benefits such as&#13;
reduced flood damage, improved drainage, saved construction and maintenance costs, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
increased canal safety are quantified where appropriate. Economic rates of return (ERRs) are&#13;
computed for project investment sites, the two investment components, and the project as a whole.&#13;
The financial analysis assesses the financial attractiveness of the project to farmers.&#13;
5.08      Assumptions. Irrigation benefits for the scheme completion component are quantified by&#13;
calculating crop budgets under full irrigation and rainfed conditions (SC component), and under full,&#13;
partial and rainfed conditions (SIFT component) for each project site. Benefits have been valued based&#13;
on the assumption that areas currently receiving inadequate irrigation water (generally the middle&#13;
reaches of irrigation canals) would be fully irrigated following scheme rehabilitation and modernisation.&#13;
Crop yields under irrigated conditions are based on yields achieved in irrigated areas as close as&#13;
possible to the scheme sites (SC) and on actual yields (SIFT) obtained through rapid rural surveys at&#13;
subproject locations and cutting trial data held by the local Agriculture Department staff. Areas&#13;
presently unirrigated (generally the tail-ends of canals) would be either fully irrigated or partially&#13;
irrigated after the project depending on the availability of water, and upper reaches of canals which are&#13;
fully irrigated at present would continue to be fully irrigated following project completion. Future with&#13;
and without project cropping pattems are based in part on existing cropping pattems, availability of&#13;
irrigation water, farmer preferences, profitability of alternative crops and the availability of markets.&#13;
Farmers are assumed to modify their cropping pattems and agronomic practices progressively over a&#13;
period of eight years, a realistic time frame. Some changes in future cropping pattems have been&#13;
incorporated, particularly in the rabi season, where it is considered that present cropping practices&#13;
inefficiently utilise the scarce water available and that the project would enhance water use efficiency&#13;
due to introduction of equitable sharing of water.&#13;
5.09      Other assumptions applicable to the analysis of both components are: (a) all costs and&#13;
benefits are in constant January 1995 prices expressed net of identifiable taxes; (b) physical&#13;
contingencies are as in the project cost estimates at para. 3.02; (c) reference prices for main crops&#13;
and fertilizer are based on estimated world reference prices adjusted to Orissa farmgate values;&#13;
(d) for other commodities not traded internationally, financial prices are adjusted by the standard&#13;
conversion factor used in India of 0.9; (e) average farmgate prices have been used in all cases,&#13;
based on information collected from rapid rural appraisal surveys, as well as market data obtained&#13;
from the Orissa Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department; (f) project benefit and cost&#13;
streams are extended over 30 years; (g) benefits are derived from incremental crop production;&#13;
(h) selection of individual schemes was based on an ERR greater than 12%, the opportunity cost&#13;
of capital for India; and (i) the project implementation period is 6 years. Assumptions,&#13;
calculations and detailed results are at Annex 19.&#13;
5.10      ERR and Sensitivity Analysis. Economic rates of return were estimated for each of&#13;
the project's scheme completion (SC) sites (54% of project costs). The ERR for the SIFT&#13;
program (25% of project costs) was obtained from detailed analysis for the 5 major project sites,&#13;
and detailed analysis on two of the remaining medium project sites which are considered&#13;
representative of diversion and storage type schemes. The two medium schemes were weighted&#13;
in the economic analysis in relation to their irrigated areas and the total area irrigated under&#13;
medium diversion and storage schemes included in the SIFT component. The project's overall&#13;
ERR is estimated at 17%. The ERR was calculated with the costs of all seven project&#13;
components included, though by ascribing only the benefits of the SC and SIFT components&#13;
(representing 80% of project costs). Benefits of the project's other components (i.e., water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
planning and environmental action plan, agricultural intensification, resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
of PAPs, community development of tribals, and institutional improvement expenditures not&#13;
directly related to SC or SIFT) have not been quantified. When costs of these items are excluded,&#13;
the project's ERR is 22%. Site-specific ERRs for the SC and SIFT components, in addition to&#13;
results for the combined SC, SIFT and entire OWRCP, are presented in the table below.&#13;
5.11        Sensitivity tests indicate that the project is robust, in economic terms, to various&#13;
shortfalls. For instance, in the event of faltering of government commitment toward the project's&#13;
policy reform actions, in particular the failure to assure adequate funding for operations and&#13;
maintenance (para. 5.14) which would result in progressive annual losses of agricultural&#13;
production on existing schemes, the ERR for the whole project would fall to 16%. If benefits&#13;
lagged by 3 years due to slower implementation (para. 5.15), the project's overall rate of return&#13;
would be 12%. Performance shortfalls in the project's farmer turnover component (para. 5.16)&#13;
would result in lower water use efficiency at farm level. If water use efficiency were to be 30%&#13;
lower than assumed,13 the project's ERR would be 15%. Overall, the project is robust to&#13;
significant changes in costs and benefits as indicated in the table below. Significant departures&#13;
from estimated costs are unlikely as costs are based on actual field experience under DOWR's&#13;
construction program. Estimated benefits are also realistic: yields are based on data from on-site&#13;
rapid rural surveys and the local Agricultural Department's cutting trial data for project sites&#13;
(SIFT) or close-by irrigated areas (SC).&#13;

5.12      Farm Financial Analysis. With provision of irrigation, application of additional labor and&#13;
other inputs would allow farm families to crop more intensively by switching to higher-valued more&#13;
labour-demanding crops, and by cropping land that usually remains fallow under rainfed conditions. A&#13;
key concern for farmers is the extra return they can expect to get from comnmitting more resources&#13;
following irrigation (scheme completions component) or from improved irrigation (SIFT subprojects).&#13;
The analysis provides a measure of the increases in net farm income on typical farm holdings&#13;
attributable to the project. The ratios calculated of incremental farm crop income to additional costs,&#13;
and to family labor in particular, provide a measure of the financial attractiveness of the project to&#13;
farmers.&#13;
5.13      Net crop income, 14 is estimated to rise substantially following completion of SIFT&#13;
investments and full development of the completed schemes (refer table below). Calculations indicate&#13;
that the returns to family labour would on average more than double following full development,&#13;
confirming the financial attractiveness of the project to farmers. These estimated returns to family&#13;
labour can be compared to the minimum daily wage for unskilled rural labour in Orissa of Rs. 25/man-&#13;
day. This indicates that the project would in general be highly financially attractive to farmers. It can&#13;
therefore be expected that farmers would adapt their farming practices from rainfed to irrigated&#13;
systems, and adopt the level of technology assumed in the crop budgets and farm model analysis. The&#13;
Agricultural Intensification Program (paras. 2.26 to 2.28) is designed to further facdiitate this&#13;
technological transformation through upgrading agricultural extension in line with the irrigation&#13;
improvements.&#13;

Project Risks&#13;
5.14       Policy Reform Commitment. All indications point to strong corrmitment on the part&#13;
of GOO/DOWR to policy reform requirement. For instance the recommended levels of&#13;
maintenance works funding have been provided for the 1994/95 and 1995/96 fiscal years, and&#13;
early achievements have been made on other policy aspects. Risk of weakening policy resolve&#13;
pertains particularly to the State's cost recovery requirement. The risk has been minimized&#13;
through: (a) extensive discussions during preparation involving many Government agencies,&#13;
NGOs and farmers, on a number of issues and actions, including preparation of the State water&#13;
policy, the institutional reorganization, expenditure prioritization, and preparation of the farmer&#13;
participation component, (b) mechanisms to ensure success of the SIFT program (para. 5.16)&#13;
which would improve the quality of irrigation service delivery; (c) an institutional mechanism to&#13;
annually review and report on progress with cost recovery (paras. 2.47 to 2.49); (d) consultancy&#13;
arrangements for DOWR to strengthen capabilities for analysis, review and assessment of water&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
charges and issues pertaining to charges; and (e) GOO/DOWR's own efforts to transfer water&#13;
rate collection functions to DOWR.&#13;
5.15      Implementation Capacity. Second is the risk of inadequate implementation capacity&#13;
and low quality of implementation, particularly with regard to civil works and the institutional&#13;
strengthening component. During preparation, major effort has been placed on the feasibility&#13;
studies, detailed design, procurement packaging, and review of construction programs for the&#13;
project's two field components: the scheme completions and the systems improvement&#13;
components, including for the latter, preparatory activities and training for farmer participation.&#13;
Consultant assistance from qualified individuals has also been used to good effect in getting&#13;
implementation underway in all aspects of the project, including institutional reorganization,&#13;
R&amp;R, basin planning, and environmental management. Risk is minimized in that GOO/DOWR&#13;
preparation of the project has centered on creating before project start-up, the basic institutional&#13;
and policy features, as well as design, procurement work and training, important to project&#13;
success. These activities have enhanced DOWR's capabilities, and brought DOWR to full&#13;
readiness for implementation of all physical works, and institutional and management actions.&#13;
Risk during implementation is reduced through the project's major consultancy, exchange visits&#13;
and training activities to sustain the process of capacity building and institutional transformation&#13;
begun during preparation. These should get on track quickly. Special procurement measures&#13;
(para. 3.14) and supervision arrangements have also been included under the project. These&#13;
various measures, based on lessons of the past and focused on ensuring both quality and pace of&#13;
execution, would help to ensure timeliness and quality of implementation. The project's in-built&#13;
monitoring and incentive mechanisms would also help reduce risk. Over time, such project&#13;
measures would be reinforced and significantly overtaken in importance as the client orientation&#13;
of the project takes hold and users become important as operators of irrigation and as parties in&#13;
state and basin water planning.&#13;
5.16      Farmer Turnover Program. The third risk relates to the innovatory SIFT program,&#13;
particularly as regards the farmer turnover objectives. Given that the civil works investments are&#13;
expected to be completed in a timely and satisfactory manner, the risks to the FOT program&#13;
would stem from: (i) farmer's potential misunderstanding of the FOT innovations; (ii) O&amp;M&#13;
mechanisms and rules are not successfully established or implemented in conjunction with farmer&#13;
involvement; and (iii) insufficient consultation with farmers about proposed investments and&#13;
obligations. Risk is minimized by incorporating lessons learned from Orissa's involvement in the&#13;
NWMP, in particular, technical aspects required to rehabilitate existing schemes such as&#13;
reordering of operational concepts and addressing the basic problems of service reliability and&#13;
equity. A phased approach to the farmer turnover objective is used, starting only on three&#13;
schemes, and implementation and monitoring of the pilot program would receive major emphasis&#13;
by DOWR. Additionally, a special consultant review of the component early in project&#13;
implementation (PY2) would be used to make decisions regarding modifications of the&#13;
component, including scaling back of the program if deemed necessary. To lessen risks of&#13;
shortfall and to sustain the efforts already being undertaken by GOO/DOWR, intensive&#13;
consultancy and training support (for farmer organizations and DOWR staff) have been built into&#13;
this program. Community organizers from local NGOs would be mobilized to provide the&#13;
intensive assistance required. As farmers would be involved early on in defining the type of&#13;
system whose operations they would oversee, their willingness as well as technical capability to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
manage the facilities would be enhanced. Prior to turnover of facilities to WUAs, there would be&#13;
a period of joint management combined with financial support by farmers of all investment costs&#13;
below the distributary head, to build up expertise of farmer organizations and further ensure&#13;
farmer ownership in canal investments.&#13;
5.17      Financial Sustainability. The project's policy action of assured funding for&#13;
maintenance could potentially be at risk from general fiscal stress in Orissa. The finances of the&#13;
State government have been structurally skewed as a result of a low and stagnant revenue base on&#13;
the one hand, and rising costs of providing for a growing and largely poor population. The gross&#13;
fiscal deficit of the State has risen from 4% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 1984/85 to&#13;
over 6% in recent years. In 1995/96 it is budgeted at 7.7%. An increasing reliance on central&#13;
loans to finance State Plan expenditures has led to a high level of debt relative to the income of&#13;
the State: expenditures on interest were about 35% of the State's tax revenues in 1993/94 (from&#13;
state taxes and Orissa's share of Central taxes), having risen from about 20% of tax revenues in&#13;
1984/85. The early 1990s show some evidence of efforts by the State government to control&#13;
spending and raise own revenues, as well as to borrow more from others when central lending&#13;
declined. A public sector attrition policy is now in effect to replace only one of every three&#13;
departing employees. GOO passed a special legislation to levy a tax on coal bearing land, and&#13;
additional resources have been mobilized from the center and from external donors for social&#13;
sector programs. Though these initiatives are a step in the right direction toward fiscal&#13;
sustainability, more would have to be done particularly in the immediate to medium term to&#13;
enhance state revenues and reduce the debt stock.&#13;
5.18      The Bank is undertaking further analysis and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with&#13;
the Orissa government regarding the State's fiscal situation. Reforms that are being implemented&#13;
to improve the finances of the Orissa power sector, would help to bring down the primary deficit&#13;
of the State to sustainable levels. In the water sector, planned actions under the OWRCP to&#13;
achieve full cost recovery of O&amp;M costs (paras. 2.47 to 2.49) would directly contribute to the&#13;
strengthening of Orissa's fiscal position. Under the agreed cost recovery program, the water&#13;
sector, which currently contributes some 5 percent to the State's current account deficit, would&#13;
have full cost recovery of current account expenditures on O&amp;M by the year 2000. As the first&#13;
phase of water charge adjustments are planned by April 1996, Orissa's full cost recovery policy&#13;
would have positive impact in the near term as well as over the medium and longer horizon. With&#13;
the OWRCP's maintenance funding policy already met for two years starting from the 1994/95&#13;
fiscal year, no additional burden would be placed on state finances by this requirement. On the&#13;
expenditure side for the water sector, the OWRCP's Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget&#13;
(paras. 4.05 to 4.07) process, which includes an annual Expenditure Prioritization exercise (paras.&#13;
2.42 to 2.44 &amp; Annex 21), would provide a mechanism for ensuring fiscal discipline in the water&#13;
sector. This would also help to reduce the State's primary deficit. The OWRCP's mid-term&#13;
review would also include a review of overall state finances, as well as the financial situation of&#13;
the water sector, to re-assess the ability of the State to finance the project. If necessary,&#13;
additional measures to achieve financial sustainability of project benefits would be agreed based&#13;
on the results of that review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
Poverty Impact&#13;
5.19      The project would improve rural living standards in one of India's poorest states.&#13;
Small and marginal farmers would benefit through introduction of irrigated water in some&#13;
previously rainfed areas. By ensuring an equitable supply of water to all farmers in irrigated areas,&#13;
the project would benefit poorer sections of the rural community who previously received little&#13;
irrigation water (tail-enders) or unreliable supplies (middle reach farmers). Employment&#13;
opportunities for landless families would also be substantially enhanced through increased labor&#13;
needs associated with expected increases in agricultural production, crop intensification and&#13;
yields. For the urban poor, the project's planning component would be important for future bulk&#13;
water supply needs. The project's emphasis on beneficiary participation would help ensure that&#13;
beneficiary needs are integrated in al decisions, efficiency is improved and service quality&#13;
sustained and affordable. Women, often under-represented in irrigation management and also the&#13;
primary users of domestic water, would receive special client emphasis. To this effect, half of the&#13;
village community organizers would be women, and farmer organization arrangements would&#13;
contain special provisions for women's participation.&#13;

            India - Orissa Water Resources
            Consolidation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Orissa's future economic
            development and social welfare require better planning and
            allocation of water across sectors and, for irrigation,
            improved efficiency of public expenditures and water use,
            and enhanced agricultural productivity. The Orissa Water
            Resources Consolidation Project has the following primary
            objectives: 1) improve the planning, management and
            development process for the state's water resources; 2)
            increase agricultural productivity through investments to
            improve existing schemes and complete viable incomplete
            schemes; and 3) enhance the department of water resources
            institutional capability. The project will contribute to
            these objectives by helping the government of Orissa (GOO)
            to establish multi-sectoral water planning, enhance the
            efficiency of public expenditures, provide more efficient
            and effective irrigation services, and upgrade DOWR's
            capabilities in all functional areas. The components of the
            project are the following: 1) scheme completions; 2) systems
            improvement and farmer participation/turnover; 3) basin
            planning and environmental action plan; 4) water resources
            research and agricultural intensification; 5) institutional
            reorganization and strengthening; 6) resettlement and
            rehabilitation; and 7) indigenous peoples development plan.
