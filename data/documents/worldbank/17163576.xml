ï»¿ANNEX I OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Program description&#13;
Rationale and Scope of the Programmatic Trust Fund&#13;
The CDmmission and the World Bank Group share a common vision of building competitive&#13;
and sustainable economies and in reducing poverty and social exclusion - goals of the Europe&#13;
2020 Agenda which is built on three pillars of smart, green and inclusive growth. To date, the&#13;
cooperation between the European Commission and the World Bank Group has been largely&#13;
indirect, with the World Bank Group engaging directly with individual European countries on&#13;
projects that are financed by the g)vernments in whole or in part by EU-origin resources, such&#13;
as thc Structural Funds, the Rural Development Fund or the Instrument for Pre-Accession&#13;
Assisrance (IPA). This experience has deepened the mutual appreciation for the&#13;
complementary competencies of each institution.&#13;
The European Commission and the World Bank Group agree that more direct interaction&#13;
would be beneficial to both insditutions and through them to the countries. This applies&#13;
particularly to the pro vision of malytical, advisory and knowledge services and technical&#13;
assistance. The European Conunission has already demonstrated its interest analytical projects&#13;
to be carried out by the World Bank Group. The European Commission has also expressed an&#13;
interest in ensuring that the Wor.d Bank provides support to the Government of Greece to&#13;
unde -ake reforms that improve tf e economic performance of Greece, the overall performance&#13;
of its logistics industries and to irprove the capacity of the Government of Greece to monitor&#13;
and cvaluate the progress of these reforms. There is good reason to anticipate that the&#13;
European Commission and the World Bank will continue to collaborate on a number of&#13;
them.s under all three pillars of the Europe 2020 Agenda during the remaining years of its&#13;
imple rnentation. This Programmnc, tic Trust Fund is set up with the express purpose of allowing&#13;
the European Commission to ava I itself of the World Bank's analytical and policy capacity in&#13;
fulfill ng the goals of Europe 2020.&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX L.A OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Des cription of the STG Activities to the carried out under the Program and the STG&#13;
Contribution&#13;
In the framework and ir line with the Program and Europe Agenda 2020, the objective of the&#13;
STG Activities is to assist and s ipport the Government of Greece undertake reforms that&#13;
impro-e the economic performaice of Greece, the overall performance of its logistics&#13;
industries and improve the capacity of the Government of Greece to monitor and evaluate the&#13;
progre ;s of these reforms, all in its efforts to undertake reforms that improve the economic&#13;
performance of the country.&#13;
Excepi as the European Commis,ion and the IBRD may otherwise agree, the World Bank&#13;
Group shall perform the following activities, subject to such modifications and refinements&#13;
thereof as the Commission and the IBRD may agree upon from time to time to achieve the&#13;
objective thereof:&#13;
1.    Components&#13;
Cornponent 1: Enhancing the bisiness environment using the Doing Business indicators&#13;
to identify issues and propose r(forms&#13;
This component suppo ts policy and institutional reforms that will improve the investment&#13;
climai. in Greece. Reforms will be based on 10 indicators that comprise the nation's ranking&#13;
in the World Bank/Intenational F nance Corporation Doing Business report .&#13;
To improve the business environment in Greece, as measured by the Doing Business&#13;
indica:.ors, support services, capacity building and training will be provided by the World&#13;
Bank Group to help:&#13;
(i)    identify which rule 3, regulations and/or procedures require the most attention;&#13;
(ii)   develop reform proposals based on the Government of Greece's priority and&#13;
based or the information provided in step (i);&#13;
(iii)  facilitate feedback, input and advice from  interested parties on proposed&#13;
reforms and build acceptance from stakeholders on the broad outlines of these&#13;
reforms through consultation, workshops and other review processes;&#13;
(iv)   develop final reform proposals which take into consideration the results of the&#13;
consultative proces s in step (iii);&#13;
(v)    design plans to implement proposed reforms;&#13;
(1) S.3rting a Business, (2' Dealing wit'i Construction Permits, (3) Getting Electricity; (4) Registering Property,&#13;
(5) GeI:ting Credit, (6) Protecting Investcrs, (7) Paying Taxes, (8) Trading Across Borders, (9) Enforcing Contracts,&#13;
and (1:)) Resolving insolven:y.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(vi)  develop plans to mcnitor and benchmark the pace of implementation progress;&#13;
(vii)  develop plans to exaluate the impact of implemented reforms; and&#13;
(viii)  provide training oi the data collection mechanisms and analytical techniques&#13;
required to evaluatc the impact of these reforms.&#13;
Suppc - to this component will be provided through the preparation by the World Bank Group&#13;
of a memorandum to be provided to the Government of Greece not later than one (1) month&#13;
after the signing of this Agreement detailing the laws, rules, regulations, and procedures that&#13;
affect the performance of each indicator and all sub-indicators measured by the Doing&#13;
Busini-ss methodology, and drawing on best international practices which shall be identified&#13;
in the reform memo. The memo will serve as the base from which the World Bank Group&#13;
will make its recommendations on which indicator to prioritize for action under the proposed&#13;
work program outlined in this Conponent.&#13;
The World Bank Group's recommendations shall be based on the following three criteria,&#13;
namely: (a) the expected econorn c benefit of these reforms; (b) the expected positive effect&#13;
that the reform will have on in substantially improving Greece's ease of doing business; and&#13;
(c) ho,v actionable these reforms are in a relatively tight timeframe.&#13;
The Vorld Bank Group support Lnder this Component may also include efforts to identify&#13;
and re solve key bottlenecks to pri7ate investment linked to the granting of land use permits.&#13;
Provir.ed the Government of Gieece confirms its interest, in early 2013, for support in&#13;
reforning its investment licensing regime, the World Bank Group will provide said assistance&#13;
by cai-rying out a review of the current situation of the investment licensing regime, based on&#13;
avaihible data, documentation, and descriptions of current systems and processes provided by&#13;
the Greek authorities. Based on such review and drawing on relevant international experience,&#13;
the World Bank Group will propose recommendations to address the issues identified in the&#13;
review.&#13;
Comionent II: Improving the performance of the trade logistics through regulatory&#13;
reforms&#13;
This component suppcrts policy, regulatory and institutional reforms that will improve the&#13;
perfo,mance of Greece's transpor and trade logistics (intra- and inter-national trade logistics).&#13;
To this effect, the Word Bank GIoup will provide assistance to the Government of Greece in&#13;
developing and planning the implementation of a comprehensive regulatory reform agenda&#13;
that will address prioritized regulatory and institutional barriers that compromise the&#13;
efficiency, cost and quality of the services provided by the industries of Greece's trade and&#13;
transp.:ort logistics-sector.&#13;
The proposed support will focus on logistics services and not cover infrastructure issues, such&#13;
as quality or quantity of infrastru:ture used by transport and trade logistics industries directly&#13;
unless identified rules or regulalions negatively affect performance of these industries. In&#13;
addition, because of th. work that the Government of Greece is already undertaking under its&#13;
National Trade Facilitation Strategy with the help of United Nations Economic Commission&#13;
on Eirope (UNECE) and the Commission's Task Force for Greece (TFGR) (with the support&#13;
of Member States and other organizations), the World Bank Group will tailor its support to&#13;
maximize the complementarity with these and other ongoing efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Accor:-ingly, to achieve improverr ents in the performance of the logistics industry in Greece,&#13;
the W:rld Bank Group will provid- support, capacity building and training to help:&#13;
(i)   assess the performance of Greece's logistics industries;&#13;
(ii)  identify the rules, regulations, public sector procedures and/or business&#13;
practices that hinde - the performance of these industries;&#13;
(iii)  develop reforms proposals that would address the issues identified and&#13;
analyzed in step (i) and (ii);&#13;
(iv)  facilitate feedback. input and advice from interested parties on proposed&#13;
reforms and build zLcceptance from stakeholders on the broad outlines of these&#13;
reforms 1hrough co isultation, workshops and other review processes;&#13;
(v)   develop :inal reform proposals which take into consideration the results of the&#13;
consultative process in step (iv);&#13;
(vi)  design plans to implement proposed reforms;&#13;
(vii)  develop plans to monitor and benchmark the pace of implementation progress;&#13;
(viii) develop -lans to evaluate the impact of implemented reforms; and&#13;
(ix)   provide training on the data collection mechanisms and analytical techniques&#13;
required to evaluat- the impact of these reforms.&#13;
Supp,rt to this component will be provided through the carrying out by the World Bank&#13;
Groul: of diagnostic activities which consist of the following two phases:&#13;
- Phase 1 consists of identifying: (1) the main rules, regulations and/or&#13;
procedures and constrain:s to implementation and enforcement as well as (2) the&#13;
business practices and governance issues that may have an adverse effect on the&#13;
performance of the sector.&#13;
The first phase will be cErried out following a methodology based on the Trade and&#13;
Transport Facilitation Assessment tool complemented by a competitiveness&#13;
diagnostics assessment, which will consider the broader competitiveness issues&#13;
affecting the sector.&#13;
- Phase 2 consists in determining the relative importance of the problems&#13;
identified in Phase 1 throt gh the following horizontal and vertical approaches:&#13;
Horizoital appro&amp;ch:&#13;
i.    Assessmen, and benchmarking of core components of logistics and&#13;
services.&#13;
ii.   Assessmen- of how trade facilitation bottlenecks (procedures at the&#13;
border) impact the quality of logistics (this activity will maximize the&#13;
s ynergies with the National Trade Facilitation Strategy).&#13;
iii.  Assessmen of the efficiency, market structure and regulation of key&#13;
services (this component may require surveys - if the assessment in&#13;
phase one indicates so). Focus will be on ancillary services.&#13;
A                        r(    e i  (u--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿iv.   Assessment of the development of dedicated facilities; for example,&#13;
warehousing and logistics centers and assess the regulatory framework&#13;
ard Public Private Partnership potential.&#13;
v.    Identification of other constraints in to the performance of the logistics&#13;
sector and determine where changes in rules, regulations and/or&#13;
implementing procedures can ease constraints.&#13;
Vertical approach:&#13;
i.    Supply chain analyses to examine the cost and competitiveness impact&#13;
of logistics inefficiencies in key export (building on the existing&#13;
Basiness Pr)cess Analysis undertaking under the Action Plan of the&#13;
National Trzde Facilitation Strategy) and import supply chains.&#13;
Component III: Improving capacity to monitor economy, progress of reforms, and&#13;
evalu:ite impact&#13;
This component is designed to Improve the capacity of key public sector institutions to&#13;
monitor, analyze and assess data on the trends and conditions of the business environment in&#13;
Greece, including most pressing c iallenges, and to evaluate the impact of this reform program&#13;
on the performance of rew and established companies in Greece.&#13;
To this effect, the World Bank Group will:&#13;
(i)   jointly implement the World Bank Group's Enterprise Survey in Greece with a&#13;
selected local institution to provide hands-on training method to transfer know-&#13;
how and build caracity on the implementation of internationally comparable&#13;
business surveys.&#13;
(ii)  support, in additio -i to the collection of firm-level data, the analysis of these&#13;
data to inform policy priorities, policies and actions that are designed to&#13;
improve the perfornance of firms in Greece.&#13;
(iii)  support the development of benchmarks and indicators that can be used to&#13;
monitor progress cn the quality and pace of implementation of as many of the&#13;
reform activities, i icluded in components 1 and 2, that the World Bank Group&#13;
and Government jointly agree are appropriate and important to track and&#13;
monitor. These activities are embedded in each of the components and do not&#13;
appear 1 ere separa :ely; and&#13;
(iv)  In addition to support in designing indicators and benchmarks, advisory&#13;
services will be provided to support the development of actionable and&#13;
comprehensive implementation plans that once in place will assist the&#13;
Government use the indicators for their own project management, policy&#13;
formulation and benchmark progress.&#13;
Prov;Jed that the Government of Greece can identify the individuals and the local institutions&#13;
that vill participate in the joint implementation of the Enterprise Survey and can also provide&#13;
access to the informalion required to draw the most current representative samples of the&#13;
privav e sector in Greece, a complete, cleaned dataset for these surveys can be provided to&#13;
Government of Greece no later tfan nine months after signing this Agreement.&#13;
