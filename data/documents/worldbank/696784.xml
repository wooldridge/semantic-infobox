ALBANIA - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:         Republic of Albania.&#13;
Beneficiaries:     Albanian Electroenergetic Corporation (KESH), the Power Corporations&#13;
of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore, and the Ministry of Mineral and Energy&#13;
Resources.&#13;
Credit Amount:    SDR 19.7 million (US$29.5 million equivalent).&#13;
Terms:            Forty years maturity with a ten-year grace period. Credit proceeds would&#13;
be lent to the Government at the standard IDA service charge.&#13;
Onlending terms:   Fifteen years maturity including a four-year grace period, at a rate equal&#13;
to the yield on Albanian Treasury Bills.&#13;
Project&#13;
Objectives:       (i) improve the overall standard, reliability and efficiency of electric&#13;
power supply and enhance the efficiency of electricity interchanges with&#13;
neighboring countries; (ii) reduce unbilled electricity consumption; (iii)&#13;
establish a regulatory framework; (iv) begin the process of privatizing the&#13;
power sector in an efficient and non-disruptive way; (v) ensure the&#13;
financial viability and institutional strength of KESH and the distribution&#13;
enterprises of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore; and (vi) encourage energy&#13;
conservation and efficiency in electric appliances and buildings.&#13;
Project&#13;
Description:      (a) power sector regulatory reform and actions leading to privatization and&#13;
institutional strengthening; (b) technical assistance for: (i) privatization and&#13;
regulatory training: (ii) management of KESH's financial department, and&#13;
(iii) engineering, project implementation management and training; and (c)&#13;
transmission, dispatching system and distribution system investments.&#13;
Environmental&#13;
Aspects:          The project has been assigned Category B. Major environmental issues&#13;
identified were: possible presence of PCBs in existing transformers at&#13;
distribution stations included in the project; and possible PCB&#13;
contamination of soil and groundwater at KESH-owned transformer&#13;
stations. An Environmental Management Plan has been prepared. KESH&#13;
will prepare an action plan for monitoring PCBs, disposing of them and&#13;
mitigating environmental damage from PCB release.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vii -&#13;
Benefits:          The economic rate of return is estimated at 24%. The benefits of the&#13;
physical components are: (i) reduction in technical transmission and&#13;
distribution losses; (ii) reduced power outages and improved voitage&#13;
stability; (iii) increased capacity to transmit and distribute electricity;&#13;
(iv) improved safe transfers of electricity between Albania and Greece; (v)&#13;
reduced operating costs and maintenance;and (vi) environmental benefits&#13;
from reduced need for thermal power generation. The benefits of the&#13;
institutional components (which were notrquantified) include: (i) reduced&#13;
non-technical losses; (ii) improved electricity bill collection;  (iii)&#13;
improved financial performance of the Beneficiaries; (iv) a regulatory&#13;
framework that would provide a suitable environment for private&#13;
investors; and (v) energy conservation and efficiency improvements in&#13;
electrical appliances and buildings.&#13;
Risks:             The project is not expected to have detrimental effects on the environment&#13;
and presents no physical risks, since it involves construction of standard&#13;
transmission, distribution and dispatching facilities. Delays in project&#13;
implementation could arise due to inadequate availability of counterpart&#13;
funds when needed; this risk would be addressed through abolition of the&#13;
excise tax and adherence to agreed financial covenants.  Delays or&#13;
changes in project scope could result from failure to mobilize the expected&#13;
cofmancing on time, or to obtain on time the rights-of-way for three&#13;
transmission lines. These risks would be addressed through provision for&#13;
resort to IDA's remedies, but even with delays, the project investments&#13;
are viable.  The project could be jeopardized if unpaid electricity&#13;
consumption increases. This risk would be reduced by implementation of&#13;
the Power Loss Reduction Project, by strengthened law enforcement and&#13;
by progressive privatization of the distribution companies. Delays could&#13;
also be caused by problems arising during the transition from public to&#13;
private ownership. These would be minimized by joint procurement of&#13;
equipment items by KESH.   The risk of privatization of the entire&#13;
distribution sector failing is minimized by having first a pilot program&#13;
involving only three distribution companies and then basing further action&#13;
on a careful review of experience gained under the pilot program.&#13;

ALBANIA&#13;
POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Background. The 1990 political changes in Albania were accompanied by a sharp&#13;
economic contraction. GDP fell by 10% in 1990, 28% in 1991 and 7% in 1992. A sharp&#13;
turnaround followed the election of a democratic government in March 1992 and the launching&#13;
of a comprehensive program of stabilization and systemic reforms. By the end of 1994, GDP&#13;
was about 20% above the 1992 level. Income, including remittances from Albanians abroad,&#13;
was up 30%. This impressive result was brought about to a large extent by the Albanian&#13;
Government's courageous implementation of very demanding IMF stand-by and IDA supported&#13;
structural adjustment programs. One of the Government's most notable achievements in this&#13;
context has been the complete privatization of agriculture, resulting in a large (30%) increase&#13;
in agricultural output over the 1992 level, despite the fact that many experts had predicted that&#13;
the individual plots of land would be too small for significant productivity increases. Both&#13;
macroeconomic management and private sector development have been exceptionally successful&#13;
so far. Indeed, the combination of low inflation (10-15% per annum for 1994 and 1995) and&#13;
rapid growth is unique in the Region.&#13;
2.    The effective constraint on further development of the economy as a whole and the&#13;
private sector in particular is now mainly in infrastructure. Infrastructure was already under&#13;
strain in the late 1980's due to decades of neglect and limited development. This has been&#13;
exacerbated by an explosion of demand triggered by Albania's opening up to the outside world&#13;
and the emergence of private sector-led growth. The Government is now beginning to tackle&#13;
the difficult problem of improving infrastructure services and of privatization of strategic sectors,&#13;
including public utilities such as power, water supply and telecommunications. To this end, the&#13;
Government has begun a mass privatization program using a voucher scheme, under which a&#13;
large number of state-owned industrial enterprises and part of the public utilities are being&#13;
offered for sale to voucher holders. Where necessary and desirable the involvement of strategic&#13;
investors would be sought. IDA has provided significant assistance to the Government in&#13;
helping develop this mass privatization program.&#13;
3.    The  Government believes that privatization is beneficial not only for the usual&#13;
macroeconomic and efficiency reasons but also for some country-specific reasons. Following&#13;
the collapse of Albania's extremely repressive communist regime, many citizens felt that&#13;
whatever belonged to the State was legitimately theirs, including such goods as bread and public&#13;
utility services. The Government has found it difficult to stop this phenomenon, in part because&#13;
its administrative capacity, while improving, is still weak. On the other hand, Albanians are&#13;
willing to respect private property. Hence, the Government has decided to embark on a program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of privatization of the electricity distribution sector, in the conviction that this will be effective&#13;
in curbing and eventually eliminating the widespread illegal use of electricity.&#13;
4.    The Government raised all energy prices sharply in April 1994, so that many of them are&#13;
now at or above economic cost. Subsidies for household energy were eliminated, the prices of&#13;
fuel wood and coal were freed from government control, and the prices of most other energy&#13;
carriers for household use were raised to the economic cost level. These energy price increases&#13;
have been the steepest experienced anywhere in Central and Eastern Europe, and the&#13;
Government deserves credit for these courageous steps. However, given the much lower per&#13;
capita incomes in Albania compared to the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, energy&#13;
consumption now weighs heavily on household budgets.&#13;
5.    The Government is following a two-pronged strategy to resolve the illegal consumption&#13;
problem. First, it is undertaking strong action (publicity campaign, law enforcement through&#13;
courts and police, etc.) to curb illegal consumption and abetment of it by some of KESH's staff.&#13;
A similar approach produced good results in the customs service. This is supplemented by&#13;
major efforts on KESH's part, including a scheme to make staff responsible for decreasing&#13;
illegal consumption within assigned areas and to provide bonuses for doing so (and penalties for&#13;
failure). Second, privatization of part or all of the electricity sector is being initiated, starting&#13;
with the pilot privatization of three distribution companies. If the experience is successful, other&#13;
distribution companies will be privatized as well, perhaps followed by the generating companies.&#13;
Private property rights are generally respected in Albania (para 3) and, hence, it is believed that&#13;
privatization of the distribution part of the sector would result in sharp reductions in illegal&#13;
consumption. Taken together, these measures constitute a well-designed package to reduce&#13;
illegal electricity use rapidly to acceptable levels.&#13;
6.  Electricity demand. Electricity demand within Albania increased sharply in 1993-94 to&#13;
3,719 gigawatt-hours (GWh), its highest level ever. Demand increases came primarily from&#13;
households and small commercial enterprises, much of it for uneconomic uses of electricity such&#13;
as space heating. The increase in household consumption was due mostly to: (i) imports of large&#13;
numbers of appliances from abroad, many of which were financed by Albanians living abroad;&#13;
(ii) the initially very low electricity price; and (iii) the above-mentioned sharp increases in illegal&#13;
consumption of electricity. Distribution losses grew from 11 % of electricity entering the&#13;
distribution network in 1989 to 51 % in 1994 and to 65% in March 1995.&#13;
7.    Failure to control non-technical losses would lead to greatly increased expenses for&#13;
thermal power generation and imported electricity, increased overloading of transmission and&#13;
distribution networks leading to frequent outages and equipment damage and a serious risk of&#13;
major supply failures greater than those that occurred in late 1994 (para 8). As long as this&#13;
situation goes unchecked electricity "demand" will increase exponentially and investment&#13;
"requirements" along with it. Investment requirements would climb to about US$150 million&#13;
per year (8% of GDP) for new generating capacity or electricity imports and repairs to the&#13;
transmission and distribution systems. Hence the Government's urgent desire to undertake a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
series of measures designed to put an end to this. Adoption of the first set of measures listed&#13;
in paragraph 5 is starting to have an effect. Because of these measures, and favorable seasonal&#13;
factors, total distribution losses fell to an average of 44% from June through November 1995.&#13;
8.    Electricity Emergency of 1994. The additional household and commercial demand, which&#13;
is heavily skewed towards the hours of peak demand on the power system, explains the surge&#13;
in peak demand to a record high in December 1994. This caused serious overloading of many&#13;
transmission networks, transformers and distribution systems in major load centers. The results&#13;
were excessive technical losses, voltage drops and instability, outages and damages to&#13;
transformers, cable, meters and other equipment. The vicious circle is that as non-technical&#13;
losses grow, technical losses increase as well and service deteriorates faster.&#13;
9.    The electricity emergency was the result of a lack of rainfall combined with the start of&#13;
the peak load winter season. The transmission and distribution systems, already weak because&#13;
of many years of under-investment and inadequate maintenance, began to crumble due to a&#13;
massive increase in electricity usage. Hydropower production (which normally accounts for&#13;
more than 90% of Albania's electricity supply) had to be reduced to less than one-third of the&#13;
normal level. In December 1994, the Government imposed a ceiling on electricity supply at&#13;
about 35% below estimated demand. Production was greatly increased at the thermal power&#13;
stations and electricity was imported from Greece. However, increased demand meant that&#13;
during periods when electricity was available distribution networks were overloaded. This&#13;
resulted in a large number of service interruptions and considerable equipment damage.&#13;
10.   The emergency underlined the urgent need to strengthen the electricity infrastructure and&#13;
to reduce technical and non-technical losses. Two current IDA projects, both cofinanced by&#13;
Switzerland, partly address these needs. The Critical Imports Project (Credit 2404-ALB)&#13;
financed, inter alia, some urgent repairs of the electricity system and some 36,000 electricity&#13;
meters. The Power Loss Reduction Project (Credit 2677-ALB), which became effective on June&#13;
9, 1995 focuses specifically on reducing non-technical losses through the implementation of a&#13;
detailed action plan, the purchase and installation of a large number of meters and technical&#13;
assistance to KESH. The proposed Power Transmission and Distribution Project would finance&#13;
a major rehabilitation and reinforcement program of the transmission and distribution systems.&#13;
Furthermore, EBRD approved in November 1994 a project to rehabilitate the Drin River&#13;
hydropower stations.&#13;
11.   The proposed project would be Albania's largest project with IDA involvement. The&#13;
total cost would be US$116.6 million of which $29.5 million would be financed by an IDA&#13;
credit, $57.6 million by cofinancing provided by OECF, EBRD and the Italian and Swiss&#13;
Governments, and the remainder by the KESH and the distribution enterprises of Elbasan,&#13;
Shkoder and Vlore. A complementary transmission project of about $20 million would be&#13;
supported by the European Investment Bank.&#13;
12.   Documents and detailed information concerning the sector and the project are in the&#13;
Project File (Annex 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. Energy Resources&#13;
13.   Albania's energy resources comprise: oil, natural gas, coal, wood and other biomass, peat&#13;
and hydropower. Remaining proven recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 27 million tons.&#13;
There are also limited remaining recoverable natural gas reserves estimated at 1.63 billion cubic&#13;
meters. Production of most of the remaining oil and gas will require enhanced recovery&#13;
methods. Minable coal reserves in seams thicker than 0.4 meters are 350 million tons, but they&#13;
are not economic. The standing stock of wood in the forest estate is about 80 million cubic&#13;
meters; there is much wood and other biomass available for fuel use outside the forest estate,&#13;
but estimates of the annual sustainable supply vary widely. Peat resources are estimated at 158&#13;
million tons, virtually all of which are located in a single deposit near Maliq. Use of peat as&#13;
a household fuel was investigated but found not to be feasible because of high ash content and&#13;
marginal economics. While Albania's hydropower potential has not been precisely established,&#13;
it is thought to be more than three times as large as the amount already developed, which&#13;
produces 4,000 GWh in a normal hydrological year. Albania's energy resources have been&#13;
sufficient to supply the country's needs and enable it until recently to be a net energy exporter.&#13;
B. Past Energy Consumption and Production&#13;
14.   Variations in total energy consumption from 1982 to 1994 reflected the evolution of the&#13;
economy over the same period. Consumption grew by 6% from 1982 to 1989, fell by 39%&#13;
from 1989 to 1992 and then rebounded by 16% to 3 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 1994&#13;
(Annexes 2.1 and 2.2).&#13;
15.   Although 1994 energy consumption was about 30% lower than the 1989 peak, per capita&#13;
consumption of 0.545 toe (0.849 toe including fuel wood) in 1994 was high compared to&#13;
consumption in countries with similar per capita incomes. The 43 low income countries listed&#13;
in World Development Report 1994, with average per capita GNP of US$390 in 1992 (compared&#13;
to $303 in Albania in 1994), had an average per capita energy consumption of 0.338 toe&#13;
(excluding fuelwood). Given that Albania's energy intensive industries have greatly reduced&#13;
production since 1989, its relatively high per capita energy consumption is due to high household&#13;
use of energy, especially electricity.&#13;
16.   From 1982 to 1989, domestically produced crude oil and fuelwood were the main sources&#13;
of supply at about 1.2 million toe each per year. Hydropower generation increased by 1986 to&#13;
about 1 million toe with the commissioning of the Komani hydropower station. Coal production&#13;
increased to over 0.5 million toe, but natural gas production fell to about 0.2 million toe as a&#13;
result of a gas field fire. After 1989, the sharp contraction of the economy combined with the&#13;
effects of insufficient previous maintenance and outdated equipment led to a virtual collapse of&#13;
energy production in Albania. Production of oil, coal and natural gas fell by 53%, 91 % and&#13;
78% respectively between 1989 and 1994. Fuelwood production estimates for this period are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
uncertain, with a reduction in officially allowed supply thought to have been largely offset by&#13;
increased illegal cutting. Hydropower was the only source of supply that was maintained at a&#13;
satisfactory level after 1989, but it too was at risk because of insufficient maintenance and&#13;
variable rainfall.&#13;
17.   Prior to 1993, Albania was a net exporter of energy. By 1994 net imports reached 13%&#13;
of total consumption, mainly because of greatly increased imports of diesel oil and to a lesser&#13;
extent gasoline and kerosene.&#13;
C. Sector Institutions and Management&#13;
18.   Responsibilities for energy are shared among several entities at the government level.&#13;
The Ministry of Mineral and Energy Resources (MME) has responsibility for: the Albanian Oil&#13;
and Gas Corporation (Albpetrol); the National Petroleum Agency, which issues licenses for&#13;
petroleum exploration and production; the Albanian Electroenergetic Corporation (KESH); and&#13;
the coal mine enterprises. The Ministry of Construction, Housing and Territory Adjustment is&#13;
responsible for the Executive Agency for Energy Resources for the Population, which prepares&#13;
and implements policies for household energy, such as arranging for imports of kerosene and&#13;
stoves. The National Committee of Energy under the Council of Ministers has responsibility&#13;
for carrying out analyses of energy policy, compiling energy statistics, making forecasts, and&#13;
liaising with foreign governments and international organizations on energy matters. The&#13;
Ministry of Finance has the lead responsibility for energy tax policy. Energy price decisions&#13;
are made by the Council of Ministers. The Committee for Environmental Protection and&#13;
Preservation, a semi-autonomous committee within the Ministry of Health, is responsible for&#13;
preparing and implementing environmental protection measures affecting the energy sector.&#13;
D. Sector Strategy&#13;
19.   Because of limited resources the Goverrnent is fightly giving first priority to&#13;
rehabilitation of existing facilities in the power and petroleum subsectors. This emphasis is&#13;
evident in the 1995-97 Public Investment Program. The Government has also begun institutional&#13;
reforms in these subsectors which would lead to privatization of Albpetrol and KESH (para 52).&#13;
In the petroleum subsector, contracts have been given to foreign oil companies for off-shore&#13;
exploration and efforts are under way to contract out exploration, enhanced recovery and&#13;
rehabilitation activities on-shore. A Petroleum Law is in place to provide the framework for&#13;
private sector involvement in petroleum. Substantial downsizing of the coal industry has already&#13;
taken place, and the remaining mines are being studied for restructuring or closure. Particular&#13;
attention has been given to meeting space heating requirements of households during the cold&#13;
winter months. Arrangements were made for imports of kerosene, liquified petroleum gas&#13;
(LPG) and stoves. During 1993 private suppliers of wood were made eligible to receive the&#13;
same subsidy as state enterprises and to compete against state enterprises in auctions of rights&#13;
to cut wood in specified areas. There was a strong response, resulting in increased fuelwood&#13;
deliveries to cities. However, because it was easy for households to steal electricity, demand&#13;
for fuelwood was limited. A National Environmental Action Plan was prepared with technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
assistance managed by IDA. Among the priorities are measures to ensure that forests are&#13;
exploited in a sustainable way so as to avoid deforestation leading to soil erosion.&#13;
E. Energy Prices&#13;
20.   Over the past three years the Government has made rapid progress in raising all energy&#13;
prices from very low levels. Prices as of March 1994 were already at or above cost for&#13;
gasoline, diesel oil, fuel oil, kerosene for non-household use and coal for non-household use.&#13;
On April 1, 1994, Government subsidies for household energy were eliminated, the prices of&#13;
fuelwood and coal for households were freed, and the prices of kerosene and LPG were fixed&#13;
at cost covering levels. Energy prices in Albania are shown in Annex 2.3.&#13;
21.   Electricity Prices. Prior to April 1, 1994 households in large cities paid 0.8 leks per&#13;
kWh for an initial block of consumption per month (250 kWh in large cities and less elsewhere)&#13;
and 3 leks per kWh for all additional consumption. On April 1, the price for all household&#13;
consumption was raised to 4.5 leks per kWh. The price is now at or above the average&#13;
household price in nearly all other Central Europe countries.&#13;
22.   The Government has implemented a scheme to compensate households for an estimated&#13;
75% of the household energy price increases by means of increases in wages, pensions,&#13;
unemployment benefits and welfare payments. The amount of compensation given to each&#13;
family depends on the type of employment of family members, whether they are unemployed,&#13;
or on pension, etc. It is independent of the amount of energy purchased. Financing was&#13;
provided initially mainly by increasing the excise taxes on energy, especially electricity. The&#13;
Government takes the difference between the retail price and 2.4 leks per kWh (from July 1,&#13;
1995) for all electricity sales within Albania. The 1994 tariff changes raised the consumption&#13;
weighted average electricity price within Albania from 1.4 to 3.8 leks per kWh. Therefore, on&#13;
average 1.4 leks per kWh of sales go to the Government as excise tax. One disadvantage of the&#13;
present compensation scheme is that for household consumers the compensation is now an&#13;
integral part of wages, pensions, etc., and in practice they can still receive the compensation&#13;
while getting electricity for free illegally.&#13;
23.   The 1994 electricity tariff reform also raised prices for private commercial and industrial&#13;
customers to more than 4 leks per kWh (Annex 2.3), depending on voltage level, but left prices&#13;
for large state-owned mining, petroleum and metallurgical industries at 2.1 leks per kWh or&#13;
lower. A logical next step in tariff reform is to eliminate the economically unjustified distinction&#13;
between state and private industrial consumers.&#13;
24.    The Government intends to adjust the level and structure of electricity prices over the&#13;
next several years to reflect economic costs. Long-run marginal costs are estimated to average&#13;
about 4.6 US cents per kWh for generation, 0.8 cents for transmission and 2.2 cents for&#13;
distribution, giving a total of 7.5 cents. These estimates are fairly rough at this stage given the&#13;
huge uncertainties pertaining to future demand. Tariff structure refinements are expected to be&#13;
made on the basis of a detailed electricity tariff study being carried out under EBRD's project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to rehabilitate hydropower stations. The Government raised prices for state-owned industries&#13;
at the beginning of 1996 so that the consumption-weighted average non-household price is&#13;
4 leks per kWh. The Government has agreed to consult with IDA by April 1, 1996 on the&#13;
recommendations and proposed timetable for implementation of the tariff adjustments&#13;
recommended in the Electricity Tariff Study, and promptly implement an action program&#13;
based on acceptable recommendations from the study in accordance with a timetable&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;
F. Energy Conservation and Efficiency Improvements&#13;
25.   Since 1991 there have been massive imports of low-efficiency electrical appliances for&#13;
household and commercial use, and the large-scale arrival of air conditioners has reportedly&#13;
begun. The recent energy price increases combined with an effective campaign to reduce illegal&#13;
electricity consumption (para 5 and 31) could lead to greatly increased energy bills for&#13;
households. These bills could be reduced by use of higher efficiency appliances and by&#13;
improved insulation of buildings. However, consumers may not have sufficient information&#13;
about appliance efficiencies and building insulation to guide their purchase decisions. The&#13;
Government agreed to carry out an energy conservation and efficiency study by June 30,&#13;
1996, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, and by January 1, 1997 begin to&#13;
implement an action program based on acceptable recommendations agreed with IDA. The&#13;
study report would encourage the use of high-efficiency household appliances and start&#13;
improving insulation of existing and new buildings. Among the options to be examined would&#13;
be appliance labelling, taxes on low-efficiency appliances, publicity campaigns, training of&#13;
housing technicians, and introduction of energy efficiency provisions in a national building code.&#13;
The study would measure efficiencies of appliances currently being used in Albania, identify&#13;
appropriate efficiency improvements for buildings, propose standards for a building code and&#13;
identify appropriate policy actions. The UNDP would provide grant financing for this study if&#13;
requested by the Government.&#13;
G. IDA Activities in the Energy Sector&#13;
26.   IDA's first credit to Albania, for the Critical Imports Project, includes financing of&#13;
US$14.1 million, plus $2.6 million of parallel financing by the Swiss Government, for urgent&#13;
repairs to the Drin River hydropower stations and the transmission and distribution systems.&#13;
The power component is being carried out successfully. A contract for meters costing $1.8&#13;
million is also being financed from the Critical Imports Project. A Power Loss Reduction&#13;
Project (US$ 5 million IDA credit and US$2.5 million Swiss Government grant) was approved&#13;
in January 1995. It focuses on reduction of non-technical electricity losses through the large&#13;
scale purchase of meters and implementation of an action plan.&#13;
27.    An Energy Sector Review was prepared in 1993. IDA managed technical assistance has&#13;
included: (i) a feasibility study for rehabilitation, upgrading and expansion of the power&#13;
transmission and distribution systems and related dispatching facilities (financed by Italy); (ii)&#13;
a power subsector organization study (Switzerland); (iii) training to help KESH establish a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
modem accounting system (Switzerland); (iv) a peat supply feasibility study ( Japan); (v) a study&#13;
of the economic feasibility of making briquettes from sawdust (Netherlands); (vi) testing of&#13;
stoves available in Albania (IDA); (vii) estimation of the demand and sustainable supply of&#13;
fuelwood (IDA); (viii) a household energy survey (Netherlands); (ix) a space heating study&#13;
(Netherlands); and (x) legal assistance to prepare an Electricity Law, a Regulatory Law, a model&#13;
Distribution License and a Bulk Power Supply Agreement (UNIDO).&#13;
III. THE POWER SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. Past Power Consumption and Supply&#13;
28.   Electricity demand within Albania (net generation minus net exports) grew by 33%  in&#13;
1993 and 1994 to a record high 3,719 GWh (Annex 3.1). This growth was due mainly to&#13;
demand increases by households and small commercial enterprises, which imported large&#13;
numbers of appliances from abroad, many of which were financed by Albanians living abroad,&#13;
and made widespread resort to illegal use of electricity. Much of the consumption was for&#13;
uneconomic uses such as space heating. Billed household demand grew from 270 GWh in 1989&#13;
to 780 GWh in 1994. Non-technical losses (mostly unbilled use by households and other small&#13;
consumers) grew from a negligible level in 1989 to an estimated 912 GWh in 1994.' The&#13;
additional household and commercial demand, which is heavily skewed towards the hours of&#13;
peak demand, explains the surge in peak load to 801 MW in December 1994 and the fall in&#13;
system load factor from 67% in 1988-1990 to 50% in 1992. The increase to 54% in 1994 is&#13;
partly explained by rationing imposed during December 1994 (para 29).&#13;
29.   A severe lack of rainfall in late 1994 forced KESH to reduce electricity production from&#13;
the Drin River hydropower stations to less than one-third of their normal level. The shortfall&#13;
was made up partly by additional thermal power production and imports. Since the transmission&#13;
lines to former Yugoslavia were out of operation because of the political events there, and&#13;
electricity supplies from Greece were limited, rationing was imposed temporarily. Whenever&#13;
electricity was available it overloaded some transmission and distribution networks, causing&#13;
frequent outages and much equipment damage.&#13;
1 Technical losses consist of energy lost in transmission and distribution lines and transformers. They arise&#13;
from the resistance of conductors and equipment to electrical current. These losses increase with increased load.&#13;
Non-technical losses consist of the difference between actual final consumption and billed consumption. Non-&#13;
technical losses arise mainly from theft, and to a lesser extent from uncalibrated and broken meters, errors and&#13;
problems with meter reading, poor invoicing and collection. Consumers without meters in Albania are billed&#13;
according to an assumed level of consumption. Consumption in excess of this level would be included in non-&#13;
technical losses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
30.   During the first three months of 1995, total demand for electricity within Albania was&#13;
18% higher than during the corresponding period in 1994. In contrast, billed sales were 4.3%&#13;
lower. Non-technical losses were 55% higher and reached 46% of electricity entering the&#13;
distribution system; total distribution losses were 65%. This was virtually a crisis situation.&#13;
It meant a revenue loss to KESH of about 1.5 billion leks during the first quarter of 1995.&#13;
Failure to take immediate and firm action would lead to even more frequent outages and&#13;
equipment damage and a serious risk of major supply failures greater than those that occurred&#13;
last year. Investment requirements would climb to levels that cannot be afforded: about US$150&#13;
million per year for new generating capacity (or electricity imports) and repairs and&#13;
reinforcement of the transmission and distribution systems.&#13;
31.   KESH and the Government have been implementing the detailed Action Plan to reduce&#13;
non-technical losses agreed under the Power Loss Reduction Project. By the end of October&#13;
1995, KESH had signed contracts for 135,000 new low-voltage meters (financed under the&#13;
Power Loss Reduction Project and the Critical Imports Project) to replace broken meters,&#13;
received 20,000 meters and installed 10,000 meters. It had engaged contractors to install 15,000&#13;
meters per month. Also in 1995, KESH: (i) introduced an incentive scheme for employees and&#13;
managers of the distribution entities aimed at reducing losses; and began to (ii) install meters&#13;
behind closed doors on the first floor of buildings; (iii) entrust collection of electricity bills in&#13;
villages to the village authorities; and (iv) collaborate with municipal authorities to reduce unpaid&#13;
consumption by consumers in illegal dwelling units.&#13;
32.   Under the incentive scheme employees are allocated to teams consisting of a meter reader&#13;
and an inspector/technician, each working on an electricity feeder which is separately metered&#13;
(e.g., Tirana is served by about 50 feeders). Each month the quantity of electricity billed from&#13;
each feeder is compared to the amount of electricity entering the feeder. Target loss figures are&#13;
fixed. If the teams exceed the targets they receive as salary bonus 50% of the value of the loss&#13;
reduction valued at the bulk supply price. The maximum bonus they can receive is 50% of&#13;
salary. If they fail to achieve the targets, their salaries for the period are reduced and can fall&#13;
to the minimum salary in KESH of 4,000 leks per month. Distribution enterprise managers are&#13;
also given incentives. In their case 10% of their base wage is retained at the beginning of the&#13;
month. If the loss target for the enterprise is achieved they receive the 10% plus a 10% bonus.&#13;
If the target is not achieved they do not receive the 10% that was withheld.&#13;
33.   The actions taken have begun to yield results. KESH has furnished evidence that total&#13;
distribution losses over the months June through November 1995 averaged 44% of&#13;
electricity entering the distribution system. However, the improvement occurred mostly&#13;
during summer months when losses tend to be lower than in winter. In 1994 losses during the&#13;
months of June-November were 49%. Additional actions are required. First and foremost is&#13;
strong government action (publicity campaign, law enforcement through courts and police, etc)&#13;
to curb illegal consumption. Privatization of parts of the electricity sector will also have a&#13;
significant impact (para 52). The Government agreed to take all necessary measures to&#13;
reduce non-technical electricity losses and to carry out publicity campaigns on the necessity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
to pay for electricity consumption. KESH and the Power Corporations of Elbasan, Shkoder&#13;
and Vlore agreed to reduce total distribution losses to 42% in 1996 and 34% in 1997.&#13;
34.   Over 90% of electricity generation in Albania comes from hydropower. Therefore,&#13;
variations in water flow account for the variations in gross generation from a high of 5,083 GWh&#13;
in 1986 to a low of 3,172 GWh in 1990. They also explain most of the fluctuation in net&#13;
electricity exports from +2,134 GWh in 1986 to -206 GWh in 1990. However the fall in net&#13;
exports from 560 GWh in 1992 to 185 GWh in 1994 was due entirely to increased demand&#13;
within Albania.&#13;
B. Existing Generating Plants&#13;
35.    Total installed capacity is 1,659 MW, of which 1,446 MW is hydro and 213 MW is&#13;
thermal (Annex 3.2). Of the 11 hydropower stations the three largest (Fierze 4x125 MW,&#13;
Komani 4x150 MW and Vau i Dejes 5x50 MW) form a cascade on the Drin River in northern&#13;
Albania (Annex 3.3). Total hydropower capacity available in dry years (with 90% probability)&#13;
is 835 MW. Total installed thermal capacity is 213 MW in 7 plants, of which the largest are&#13;
Fieri (oil/gas, 159 MW) and Ballsh (oil/gas, 24 MW) (Annex 3.4). The smaller thermal power&#13;
stations are for district heat supply, but only the Korce plant is still in operation. Estimates of&#13;
available electric energy in Albania depend on water flows and the shape of the demand curve&#13;
over the year. For 1994 gross expected generation was 3,500 GWh with 90% probability (with&#13;
respect to hydropower availability), 3,800 GWh with 75% probability and 4,313 GWh with 50%&#13;
probability.  Actual gross generation was 3,904 GWh.  Although this figure exceeded&#13;
consumption within Albania in 1994, rationing had to be imposed in December because of a&#13;
seasonal shortage of hydropower. Continued demand growth would increase the risk of future&#13;
shortages, and it will be several years before new power stations can be brought into operation.&#13;
Shortages can be averted through resort to imports, provided these are available when needed.&#13;
KESH has access to imports from Greece through a 400 kV interconnection.&#13;
C. Existing Transmission and Distribution Facilities&#13;
36.   At the end of 1994, the transmission system in Albania consisted of 120 km of 400 kV&#13;
lines, 1,100 km of 220 kV, 1,180 km of 110 kV and 1,150 km of 35 kV. The distribution&#13;
system consisted of 40 km of 20 kV lines, 12,840 km of 10 kV and 6 kV lines, and 31,630 km&#13;
of 0.4 kV lines. The 400 and 220 kV transmission lines appear to be strong and well balanced&#13;
for meeting load demand requirements up to the year 2000.  However, the change in&#13;
composition of demand away from high-voltage industrial consumers to low-voltage household&#13;
and small commercial consumers has caused serious overloading of the 110 kV and 35 kV&#13;
systems, the 220/110 kV transformers and the distribution systems in major load centers. These&#13;
facilities were already badly deteriorated because of lack of previous rehabilitation. The results&#13;
are excessive losses, voltage drops and instability, outages and damage to transformers, cables,&#13;
meters and other equipment. For example, 1,200 medium-voltage (MV)/low-voltage (LV)&#13;
transformers (20 % of the total) were damaged from 1992 to 1994. Technical losses were 11.7 %&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
of net generation for transmission plus 12.4% for distribution. In an efficient power system of&#13;
comparable size the combined losses would be less than 10%. Reduction in these losses will&#13;
require large investments in rehabilitation, upgrading and reinforcement of the transmission and&#13;
distribution networks. IDA would contribute to financing these investments under the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
D. Load Forecast&#13;
37.   Since Albania is in transition between two fundamentally different economic systems, the&#13;
reliability of a long-run forecast of electricity demand is very low. This is compounded by&#13;
uncertainty regarding the impact of actions to reduce non-technical losses on fast growing&#13;
household and commercial demand (which increased from 34% of total demand within Albania&#13;
in 1989 to 59% -including non-technical losses- in 1994).&#13;
38.   In 1994, KESH's Institute of Energy completed a study of electricity demand to the year&#13;
2010. The medium case consisted of a fixed growth rate of 6% per year based on judgments&#13;
of the Institute's staff. A second forecast was made by the European Union (PHARE) in a&#13;
document entitled "Energy Policy Framework". This was part of a detailed forecast for the&#13;
entire energy sector using an econometric simulation model with about 100 external variables&#13;
providing different aspects of the social, economic and policy framework. The electricity&#13;
forecast shows growth of 8.9% per year from 1995 to 2000 and 6.6% per year from 2000 to&#13;
2010. In order to verify these forecasts, the mission prepared projections to the year 2010 for&#13;
industry, households, agriculture and others using an econometric model. One case, based on&#13;
less effective non-technical loss reduction measures, gives an annual growth rate of 7.3% to the&#13;
year 2000. A second case, based on a more effective program, gives a growth rate of 4.3%.&#13;
39.   KESH's forecast of 6% demand growth corresponds to a moderately successful program&#13;
to reduce non-technical losses. The 6% annual rate of growth is far below the 18% increase&#13;
from early 1994 to early 1995. On the other hand, a very strong program to reduce non-&#13;
technical losses could lead household and commercial electricity customers to reduce their&#13;
consumption by enough to cause total demand to cease growing for several years or even to&#13;
drop. For planning purposes, account should be taken of this possible outcome. The project&#13;
rate of return estimate (para 120) and the financial forecasts (paras 108 and 113) both assume&#13;
zero growth in total consumption.&#13;
E. Power Subsector Investment Program&#13;
40.   Investment priorities established by KESH and the Government for the power subsector&#13;
over the next several years include: (i) meter installation, to reduce non-technical losses; (ii)&#13;
rehabilitation and reinforcement of the transmission and distribution systems; (iii) rehabilitation&#13;
of existing hydropower stations; (iv) rehabilitation of the Fieri and Ballsh thermal power&#13;
stations; and (v) construction of new hydro and thermal power stations. Detailed feasibility&#13;
studies have been carried out for the first three priorities. These provide the basis for defining&#13;
least-cost investment programs. The EBRD and co-financiers are providing financing for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
hydropower rehabilitation.  The Power Loss Reduction Project is providing funds for&#13;
investments needed for non-technical loss reduction. The proposed project would provide&#13;
assistance for transmission and distribution system rehabilitation. Efforts are under way by&#13;
KESH and the Government to find sponsors to construct and operate the Bushati and Banja&#13;
hydro projects, and rehabilitate the Fieri and Ballsh thermal power stations. KESH is also&#13;
planning to begin preparations for a new thermal power station and the Tepelene hydropower&#13;
station (2x60 MW) on the Viosa River. All these are assumed to be independent power projects&#13;
(IPPs) and do not enter KESH's own investment program. They are likely to be in the least-cost&#13;
power generation investment program for Albania.&#13;
41.   Annex 3.5 presents projected electrical energy and capacity balances assuming 6 % annual&#13;
growth in demand to the year 2000 prepared by KESH. One new power station, Bushati (80&#13;
MW, 300 GWh),is assumed to enter service in 1999, which may be optimistic. But even with&#13;
Bushati, the deficit grows from 100 GWh in 1996, assuming a 90% probability level of&#13;
hydropower generation, to 1,293 GWh in 2000. The deficit could be covered by imports.&#13;
However, a vigorous program to reduce non-technical losses could reduce or prevent entirely the&#13;
emergence of a deficit before the year 2000. After the year 2000, electricity consumption is&#13;
likely to grow as a result of expected economic growth. KESH is now preparing, with EBRD&#13;
technical assistance, a least-cost generation investment program in order to determine more&#13;
precisely priorities for rehabilitation of existing thermal power stations and construction of new&#13;
hydro and thermal plants.&#13;
F. 1995-2000 Investment Expenditures Forecast&#13;
42.   An investment expenditures forecast through 1999 was prepared by KESH (Annex 3.6)&#13;
and incorporated in the Government's Public Investment Program for the period 1995-97.&#13;
Financing has been identified for all of the foreign expenditures listed in the program. The local&#13;
cost expenditures are projected to be about 31 % of total planned expenditures in constant 1995&#13;
prices from 1996-99 and are expected to be financed by KESH. The investment program is not&#13;
only the minimum necessary, it is too small. Some needed investments were excluded on the&#13;
grounds that financing has not yet been identified.  The program does not include any&#13;
investments for existing thermal power stations nor for new power stations, although such&#13;
investments are needed and are being planned. It is assumed that they will be IPPs. KESH&#13;
agreed to review with IDA, by September 30 of each year, its proposed investment program&#13;
for the following five years and take the Association's views into consideration in finalizing&#13;
this program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
IV. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEHCIARICES&#13;
43.   The Government of Albania would be the Borrower. KESH, the Power Corporations of&#13;
Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore, and MME would be the Beneficiaries. Subloan amounts would be:&#13;
KESH (US$10.6 million), Elbasan (US$6.6 million), Shkoder (US$6.3 million) and Vlore&#13;
(US$6.0 million). The Government agreed to onlend the credit in leks to KESH and the&#13;
Power Corporations of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore for a period of 15 years, including 4&#13;
years' grace, at a rate adjusted every six months, equal to the average rate of the bi-weekly&#13;
auctions of the Albanian 12 months Treasury Bills over the preceding six months period&#13;
plus a premium acceptable to the Association. A premium of zero was accepted by IDA since&#13;
the Treasury Bill rates without premium reflect current commercial terms.&#13;
A. KESH&#13;
44.   KESH is a state entity under the Ministry of Mineral and Energy Resources, established&#13;
in 1992 in accordance with the Law on State Entities dated July 13, 1992. Its statute defines&#13;
it as a vertically integrated entity responsible for production, transmission, distribution and sale&#13;
of electricity to consumers throughout Albania and to export markets. KESH's organizational&#13;
structure is shown in Annex 4.1.&#13;
45.   Within KESH the operation of the production and transmission systems is carried out by&#13;
13 regional production and transmission entities. Distribution is carried out by 32 distribution&#13;
entities, which until 1991 were separate state entities under a different ministry (the Ministry of&#13;
Construction). Even today, they maintain a high level of independence, and prepare separate&#13;
financial statements for their activities. These practices facilitate preparation for privatization&#13;
of the enterprises. Some industrial high-voltage consumers are supplied directly by the&#13;
production and transmission entities. In addition to electricity supply, KESH is also involved&#13;
in the production and sale of steam to industrial users.&#13;
46.   As of early 1995, the number of staff of KESH totaled about 9,500, of whom 5,100 are&#13;
employed in the distribution entities, 3,900 in the production and transmission entities, and the&#13;
rest, some 500, in the head office in Tirana and other branches of KESH such as the Institute&#13;
of Energy, the central workshops and the central stores. At the end of 1994, KESH had about&#13;
665,000 customers, of whom about 95% were households.&#13;
B. Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore Distribution Enterprises&#13;
47.   The three pilot distribution enterprises serve three of the six major urban areas of&#13;
Albania. They are all about the same size in terms of number of customers (40,000 -50,000) and&#13;
number of employees (about 300). They differ in geographic location and state of disrepair.&#13;
The Shkoder enterprise in northern Albania suffers from the highest levels of outages and power&#13;
losses. The Elbasan enterprise in central Albania near Tirana enjoys the highest operating&#13;
standards of the three and the lowest losses. The Vlore enterprise is located in a Adriatic port&#13;
city in southern Albania and maintains quality standards between those of Shkoder and Elbasan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
The three enterprises may be considered as representative medium sized urban distribution&#13;
enterprises in Albania. Statistical data on these enterprises are in Annex 4.2.&#13;
48.   The distribution enterprises are responsible for the 4-10 kV network (the 20 kV level is&#13;
now being introduced in a few large cities). Nearly all their electricity supply is generated and&#13;
transmitted by KESH. However, some enterprises such as Vlore operate their own small&#13;
generating units as well.  In the three pilot enterprises, about 95%  of the customers are&#13;
households, with the remaining 5% divided between state and privately-owned industrial and&#13;
commercial enterprises. Buyers taking electricity at voltages higher than 20 kV buy directly&#13;
from KESH.&#13;
C. Power Subsector Reform&#13;
49.   A Power Subsector Organization Study (April 1994) was carried out by Electrowatt&#13;
Engineering Services Ltd of Switzerland. Its main recommendations include keeping for the&#13;
next few years KESH as an integrated company responsible for generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution; establishing it as a joint-stock company; negotiating a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding between it and MME designed to ensure its autonomy; and preparing an&#13;
Electricity Law which would, among other things, provide for production and sale of power by&#13;
independent entities. There would be a major internal reorganization allocating staff to five&#13;
directorates. New financial, accounting and management information systems would be set up,&#13;
with each production and distribution entity treated as a cost center. A new computerized billing&#13;
system would be established.&#13;
50.   Two longer-term scenarios are considered in the study. In the first scenario, which&#13;
assumes that KESH would continue as a vertically integrated state owned monopoly, there would&#13;
be no requirement to create an independent regulator. The Memorandum of Understanding&#13;
could continue to serve as the main regulatory instrument. The only modifications recommended&#13;
would be to separate ownership from policy-making and regulation and amend the Electricity&#13;
Law to make the Memorandum of Understanding a statutory requirement. This scenario would&#13;
allow for private development of new power stations on the basis of licenses provided for under&#13;
the Electricity Law.&#13;
51.   The second scenario allows for unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
and significant private ownership in one or more of these activities. It recommends to transfer&#13;
regulatory responsibility to an independent regulatory entity and create a licensing framework&#13;
with separate licenses for transmission, distribution and supply. These steps would require&#13;
legislation, and could be achieved by drafting a new Regulatory Law to supplement the&#13;
Electricity Law.&#13;
a. Privatization&#13;
52.   The Government has decided to implement the second scenario (para 51), and plans to&#13;
privatize the power sector beginning with the distribution entities. The main reason for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
beginning with distribution and for acting quickly is to reduce non-technical electricity losses.&#13;
Privatizing the distribution companies would give a greater incentive to reduce these losses than&#13;
other options that have been considered, such as management contracts or concessions. It is also&#13;
believed that Albanian consumers have greater respect for private companies than for state&#13;
entities. The Government has begun to privatize the distribution entities of Elbasan, Shkoder&#13;
and Vlore during 1995 on a pilot basis. These companies are large enough to be viable, but not&#13;
so large as to discourage potential Albanian strategic investors with limited resources.&#13;
Proceeding on a pilot basis will provide the Government and potential buyers of other&#13;
distribution companies an opportunity to evaluate the performance of the pilot companies and&#13;
adjust their strategies accordingly. IDA and UNIDO have been jointly providing technical&#13;
assistance to MME to prepare the pilot project and the legislative framework for privatization&#13;
and regulation.&#13;
53.   The first major step towards privatizing Elbasan, Shkoder, and Vlore was to convert&#13;
them to joint-stock companies in October 1995 in accordance with the provisions of the Law&#13;
on the Transformation of State Enterprises into Joint-Stock Companies (effective May 15, 1995).&#13;
Initially the shares were all held by the Ministry of Finance. The enterprises were given full&#13;
authority to negotiate project agreements with IDA. The remainder of KESH was also&#13;
converted to a joint-stock company under the same law.&#13;
54.   In August 1995, Parliament approved an Electricity Law providing for unbundling and&#13;
possible privatization of the power sector and involvement of IPPs and a Law on Privatization&#13;
of the Electrical Power Department providing for privatization of the power sector beginning&#13;
with distribution. In October 1995, Parliament approved a law requiring that at least 30% of&#13;
the shares of a privatized power sector entity should be sold through the mass privatization&#13;
program and at least 30% of the shares should be reserved for a strategic investor. Over the&#13;
period November 15 - December 20, 1995, 30% of the shares of Elbasan, Shkoder and&#13;
Vlore were auctioned in exchange for vouchers. Since employees of any enterprise for which&#13;
shares are sold through the mass privatization program are allowed to bid the vouchers they&#13;
would be entitled to over three rounds of voucher issue, while other citizens can bid only the&#13;
vouchers they have received so far (one round), the employees of the three distribution&#13;
companies benefited from this privilege.&#13;
55.   MME is seeking strategic investors to acquire majority shares of the three distribution&#13;
enterprises and other distribution enterprises. Technical assistance for this purpose would be&#13;
provided under the project. Among the issues to be studied would be whether it would be&#13;
desirable to merge the 35 distribution entities into a small number of larger companies. The&#13;
present number of 35 entities is very large. For purposes of privatization, it would be easier&#13;
for Albanian buyers with limited resources to acquire them. However, there would be a loss&#13;
of economies of scale, possible difficulties in obtaining loans and the Government might be left&#13;
with the least desirable (i.e., most rural) distribution entities. Strategic investors would probably&#13;
only be interested in distribution companies of a sufficiently large size. On the basis of the&#13;
efforts made to find strategic investors and the performance of the three pilot distribution&#13;
companies during 1996, a plan would be prepared for privatization of all the distribution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
companies. The Government agreed to prepare an action plan satisfactory to IDA by&#13;
August 31, 1996 for the sale of the remainder of the power distribution sector, and&#13;
thereafter implement the plan taking into consideration IDA's comments.&#13;
56.   The Government and KESH  should decide whether and if so how to unbundle&#13;
transmission and generation. One option under consideration would be to keep the three existing&#13;
Drin River hydropower stations together in a single entity, keep transmission and dispatching&#13;
as a single entity, create separate entities for the Fieri and Ballsh thermal stations, and combine&#13;
the remaining hydropower stations with the distribution entities located in the same geographic&#13;
areas. The Drin River power stations should be kept together in order to minimize transactions&#13;
costs and ensure supply security. However, since they account for about 90% of Albania's total&#13;
electricity production, competition could not be achieved in the Albanian power sector until new&#13;
independent power plants come into operation. Under these circumstances unbundling of&#13;
generation and transmission would not be necessary at this stage and should be done only when&#13;
the Government decides to offer the generation companies for sale. This would constitute the&#13;
next stage of power sector privatization, following distribution. Transmission should probably&#13;
remain with the State for some time because of its strategic dispatching and generation capacity&#13;
planning functions. Privatization of generation and transmission, if and when it takes place,&#13;
should be done to strategic investors, with sales through vouchers for no more than 49% of&#13;
shares of any given company. However, even more urgent than privatizing generation is to find&#13;
financing for rehabilitation of existing thermal power stations, and construction of new power&#13;
stations for meeting domestic demand or for export sales.&#13;
b. Regulatory Framework&#13;
57.   A Regulatory Law to establish a regulatory board for the power sector was enacted in&#13;
1995. The Electricity Regulatory Board will be an independent body supported by competent&#13;
professional staff and will report to the Council of Ministers. Its principal goals would be to&#13;
protect: (i) investors from direct or indirect expropriation of capital; (ii) the enterprise from&#13;
unnecessary interference in its operating and investment decisions; (iii) consumers from a utility&#13;
that has monopoly power, exercised through inefficient production and/or high prices and low&#13;
quality of service; (iv) competition itself by preventing collusion between utilities and other&#13;
forms of anti-competitive behavior. In order to help ensure its independence it will have a&#13;
budget that is not funded by the Government but through levies from the entities it regulates&#13;
(e.g., a small fee per kWh sold). Decision making will be transparent since it will be based on&#13;
explicit rules, and decisions will be made public. There is to be no interference in the&#13;
management of an enterprise, but it will be held strictly accountable if service falls below&#13;
specifically agreed standards. Lack of performance is to be penalized and, if continued, would&#13;
lead to loss of the license. The responsibility of MME under the new regulatory framework will&#13;
be focussed on energy security policy and KESH's transmission activity. MME has been&#13;
preparing for the establishment of the new regulatory framework since mid-1994 when it created&#13;
a regulatory department and a privatization department. Key Ministry staff have made study&#13;
tours abroad and will likely move to the new regulatory authority. The Government has&#13;
appointed the Chairman and two Members of the Electricity Regulatory Board, and will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
give to the Board full responsibility for regulation of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore Power&#13;
Corporations by July 1, 1996.&#13;
58.   Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore Power Corporations commenced operations at the start&#13;
of 1996 under signed distribution licenses, and compliance with these licenses will be&#13;
supervised by MME for the period before the Electricity Regulatory Board assumes its full&#13;
power over these companies. The licenses set out the rights and obligations of the licensee.&#13;
They establish the initial levels of the margin between the purchase and selling prices of the&#13;
private distribution enterprises and the mechanism for adjusting the margin. A price cap&#13;
approach has been adopted which provides for automatic adjustments over a five-year period.&#13;
The margin will allow licensees to earn potentially very large profits, depending on how much&#13;
they exceed the loss reduction and bill collection targets set out in the license agreements.&#13;
Licensees who fail to meet the loss reduction and other targets (such as supply reliability) will&#13;
find their licenses subject to review and possibly revoked by the regulator. Focusing on the&#13;
distribution margin rather than on the bulk prices and retail sales prices in the initial licenses has&#13;
the advantage of leaving the Government the flexibility to decide later whether or not to fix&#13;
uniform national retail electricity prices and other aspects of the tariff structure and level.&#13;
59.   The three pilot distribution companies have also signed Bulk Power Supply&#13;
Agreements and Implementation Agreements with KESH. Among the provisions of the&#13;
Implementation Agreements are: (i) KESH will undertake procurement of goods free of&#13;
charge on behalf of these companies with respect to goods purchased under the Power&#13;
Transmission and Distribution Project; (ii) KESH will provide through a steady flow from&#13;
December 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996 the following total quantities of meters acquired under&#13;
the Power Loss Reduction Project: 19,000 to Elbasan, 23,000 to Shkoder and 20,500 to&#13;
Vlore (The distribution companies will compensate KESH on the same terms as KESH pays&#13;
on its subloan from the Government under the Power Loss Reduction Project); and (iii)&#13;
KESH will assist the companies to establish new accounting systems and introduce&#13;
computerized billing systems. IDA could invoke its remedies if the distribution licenses or&#13;
any regulatory enactments have been amended, repealed, abrogated, suspended or waived&#13;
so as to affect materially and adversely the ability of the pilot companies to perform their&#13;
obligations under the Project Agreements.&#13;
V. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
60.   The Albanian electric power system is experiencing serious operating problems due to&#13;
insufficient development of its subtransmission system and distribution network, and the lack of&#13;
rehabilitation and reinforcement of its facilities during the last fifteen years.  This has&#13;
significantly reduced operating reliability. Three major existing problems are: (a) serious&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
overloading of 110 kV subtransmission facilities and distribution networks resulting in heavy&#13;
losses, voltage drops, power outages and the failure of many distribution transformers; (b)&#13;
abnormal power factor values due to the lack of reactive supply capability on the subtransmission&#13;
and distribution systems; (c) outdated system control and protection equipment and very deficient&#13;
communications facilities threatening system  safety and reliability.  Without an intensive&#13;
rehabilitation of the system, combined with non-technical loss reduction, there is a significant&#13;
risk of major breakdowns.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
61.   The objectives of the proposed project are to: (i) improve the overall standard, reliability&#13;
and efficiency of electric power supply and enhance the efficiency of electricity interchanges&#13;
with neighboring countries; (ii) reduce unbilled electricity consumption; (iii) establish a&#13;
regulatory framework for the power sector; (iv) begin the process of privatizing KESH in an&#13;
efficient and non-disruptive way; (v) ensure the financial viability and institutional strength of&#13;
KESH and the Power Corporations of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore; and (vi) encourage energy&#13;
conservation and efficiency in electric appliances and buildings.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
62.   The proposed project consists of:&#13;
(a)    power sector regulatory reform  and actions leading to privatization and&#13;
institutional strengthening;&#13;
(b)   technical assistance:&#13;
(i)   to MME for privatization and regulatory training:&#13;
(ii)  to KESH to strengthen its financial department; and&#13;
(iii) to KESH for engineering and project implementation management, as&#13;
well as staff training; and&#13;
(c)    critically needed investments consisting of:&#13;
(i)    a new double-circuit 220 kV line of about 4 km  interconnecting&#13;
Elbasan 1 and Elbasan 2 substations;&#13;
(ii)    a new  double-circuit 110 kV transmission line of about 105 km&#13;
between Elbasan, Cerrik, and Korce, and addition of reactive power&#13;
compensation capacity in the system up to about 30 megavar (MVAR);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(iii)   reconstruction and reinforcement of the 110 kV  ring connection&#13;
between Tirana, Selite and Traktori substations;&#13;
(iv)    a new 220/110 kV substation in Durres;&#13;
(v)    rehabilitation and reinforcement of two 220 kV, and sixteen 110 kV&#13;
existing primary substations;&#13;
(vi)    upgrading of system control facilities (including the National Dispatch&#13;
Center and Remote Terminal Units;&#13;
(vii)   rehabilitation of distribution networks in major cities and load centers,&#13;
including Tirana, Durres, Fieri, Berati, Diber, Lac and Sarande, and&#13;
three pilot distribution companies for privatization, i.e., Shkoder,&#13;
Elbasan and Vlore; and&#13;
(viii)  spare parts for transmission and distribution systems.&#13;
Details of the physical project components are provided in Annexes 5.1. 5.2 and 5.3. During&#13;
project preparation IDA provided major technical assistance to the Government to establish a&#13;
regulatory framework for the power subsector. In addition technical assistance would be&#13;
provided to the Government for an energy conservation and efficiency study.&#13;
D. Cost Estimates&#13;
63.   The estimated cost of the proposed project, including contingencies, is about US$117&#13;
million, of which about US$87 million equivalent in foreign exchange and about US$30 million&#13;
equivalent in local costs (Table 5.1). Given the nature of the lending arrangements, there would&#13;
be no interest during construction. The cost estimates reflect end-1994 prices and are based on&#13;
the latest tendering information available for similar equipments. Physical contingencies are&#13;
calculated at 10 percent for foreign and local costs. Price-contingency allowances for foreign&#13;
costs estimated in US dollars are calculated according to anticipated international price increases&#13;
of 2.2 percent a year on average for the period 1995 -2004. The price escalation for costs&#13;
expressed in local currency is calculated according to projected domestic inflation rates of 10&#13;
percent for 1995 and 1996, and 8 percent thereafter. Detailed estimates of project costs and&#13;
estimated annual project expenditure are provided in Annexes 5.4 and 5.5 respectively.&#13;

65.    The proposed financing by IDA, OECF, EBRD, the Italian Government, and the Swiss&#13;
Government, of about US$87 million equivalent would finance the following components:&#13;
(a) IDA:&#13;
(i)    Rehabilitation of the Shkoder, Durres, Elbasan, Vlore, Fieri, Berati, Lac and&#13;
Saranda distribution networks;&#13;
(ii)    Technical assistance for environmental management and to strengthen KESH's&#13;
finance department, including training; and&#13;
(iii)   Technical assistance to the Ministry of Mineral and Energy Resources for&#13;
privatization and staff training for the Electricity Regulatory Board.&#13;
(b) OECF:&#13;
(i)    Tirana distribution network rehabilitation;&#13;
(ii)    Expansion of transformer capacity for existing major primary substations; and&#13;
(iii)   Replacement of obsolete switchgear and line protection for existing major&#13;
primary substations.&#13;
(c) EBRD:&#13;
(i)    The Elbasan-Cerrik-Korce and Elbasan 1 - Elbasan 2 transmission lines;&#13;
(ii)    Tirana-Selite-Traktori Ring Connection;&#13;
(iii)   Engineering services for transmission facilities design; and&#13;
(iv)   Spare parts.&#13;
(d) Italy:&#13;
(i)    System Control facilities (including the National Dispatch Center, and Remote&#13;
Terminal Units); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(ii)   Engineering services for system control facilities design and supervision of&#13;
construction.&#13;
(e) Switzerland:&#13;
(i)    Durres substation;&#13;
(ii)   Engineering services for Durres substation design and supervision of&#13;
construction; and&#13;
(iii)  Consultant services for project management, including training.&#13;
66.   The proposed financing arrangement has been discussed with potential donors and&#13;
cofinanciers. The EBRD has approved its cofinancing. The Italian and Swiss Governments has&#13;
given preliminary commitments to finance. OECF has informed the Bank in writing that it&#13;
would like to follow the project closely with the objective of providing cofinancing. The&#13;
proposed cofinancing arrangements are shown in Annex 5.6. The cost estimates and cofinancing&#13;
arrangements exclude provision for technical assistance for energy conservation and efficiency&#13;
(para 25). In addition to the above, EIB is preparing to finance a complementary project, which&#13;
would include the following three transmission components: (i) a new 220 kV substation in&#13;
Vlore; (ii) a new 220 kV transmission line from Fieri to Vlore (about 30 km); and a new 110&#13;
kV line from Peshkopi to Kukes (about 44 kum). Government agreed to grant to KESH by&#13;
June 30, 1996 the rights of way for the Elbasan-Cerrik-Korce and Elbasan 1-Elbasan 2&#13;
transmission lines and the ring connection between the Tirana, Selite and Traktori&#13;
substations including all necessary environmental clearances. IDA could invoke its remedies&#13;
if by April 30, 1996 the effectiveness of the OECF and Swiss cofinancing is not obtained.&#13;
Failure of these events to be achieved on time would delay the transmission lines and the OECF&#13;
and Swiss financed items, but the other components of the project, which are technically,&#13;
financially and economically feasible on their own, could still be carried out on schedule.&#13;
F. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
67.   KESH engaged Electroconsult of Italy to conduct a feasibility study for the least cost&#13;
rehabilitation and reinforcement of the transmission and distribution networks, and upgrading&#13;
of the system control facilities, in accordance with terms of reference agreed with IDA. The&#13;
study was completed in 1993 and reviewed jointly by KESH and IDA. A rehabilitation and&#13;
reinforcement program for the power transmission and distribution systems and associated&#13;
control facilities for 1994-2005 was prepared. Priority areas for rehabilitation and reinforcement&#13;
over 1996-2000 were identified and included under the proposed project as part of KESH's least-&#13;
cost development program. Engineering work is being done by the Institute of Energy.&#13;
68.   KESH is able to carry out most of the engineering and construction supervision required&#13;
for the transmission and distribution works, using existing staff. The bidding documents for&#13;
contracts for the supply of urgent materials and equipment for distribution network rehabilitation&#13;
have been prepared by KESH for advance procurement (para 72). However, in view of the&#13;
magnitude and complexity of existing and future operations, there is a need for consulting&#13;
services to assist KESH in detailed design and engineering for the new transmission lines, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Durres substation and system control facilities, and to upgrade its engineering, project&#13;
management and materials control capabilities.&#13;
69.   The new transmission line routes and Durres substation site have been selected.&#13;
Preliminary designs for transmission lines were prepared by the Institute of Energy. EBRD is&#13;
providing technical assistance for the detailed design, including environmental assessment, and&#13;
preparation of bidding documents for the transmission facilities. The bidding documents are&#13;
expected to be completed by February 1996.&#13;
70.   The Italian and Swiss Governments would provide engineering services through turn-key&#13;
contracts for the system control facilities and Durres substation, respectively.  KESH is&#13;
preparing preliminary designs for the system control facilities and the Durres substation. Based&#13;
on this, KESH will prepare requests for proposals (including performance-type technical&#13;
specifications) to select contractors to undertake the turn-key contracts for the Durres substation&#13;
and the system control facilities. The requests for proposals for the Durres substation and for&#13;
the system control facilities are expected to be completed by March 1996.&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
71.   Major equipment and materials for transmission and distribution components financed by&#13;
IDA would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with&#13;
IDA Procurement Guidelines (January 1995). Goods and materials manufactured in Albania and&#13;
procured through ICB would be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the&#13;
cif price or the actual import duty, whichever is lower (Guidelines paras 2.54 and 2.55 and&#13;
Appendix 2). Miscellaneous items, such as special tools, instruments, and accessories needed&#13;
for construction and maintenance of the transmission and distribution systems, estimated at&#13;
US$300,000 or less per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$1 million (or less than four&#13;
percent of the credit) would be procured through international shopping procedures based on&#13;
three quotations from at least two different countries.  Individual consulting services for&#13;
environmental management and training for an aggregate amount of about US$0.3 million for&#13;
KESH, and for regulatory training for MME for an amount of about US$50,000 would be&#13;
obtained following IDA's guidelines for the use of Consultants. Firms would be selected on&#13;
the basis of a short list to provide technical assistance to KESH's finance department for an&#13;
amount of about US$3.5 million, and assistance to MME to help it find strategic investors for&#13;
the power distribution entities for an amount of about US$350,000. Prior review by IDA of&#13;
budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and&#13;
contracts would not be needed for contracts for the employment of firms estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$100,000, or contracts for the employment of individual consultants estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$50,000. However, prior review by IDA would be needed for all terms of&#13;
reference. IDA standard bidding documents for procurement of goods will be used. Prior&#13;
review by IDA of procurement documentation would be required for all ICB and LIB contracts&#13;
(about 92 percent of IDA funded purchases). Locally financed goods and services would be&#13;
procured under prevailing local procedures which involve competitive bidding and are judged&#13;
satisfactory. Procurement of goods and services financed by OECF, EBRD, Italy, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Switzerland would follow procedures set out by OECF, EBRD, the Government of Italy, and&#13;
the Government of Switzerland respectively. A detailed procurement plan and schedule are&#13;
shown in Annex 5.7. Attachment III. Quarterly progress reports would be furnished to IDA on&#13;
procurement activities.&#13;

distribution network rehabilitation: (i) MV cable, estimated to cost about US$1.2 million; and&#13;
(ii) LV circuit breakers, estimated to cost about $1.0 million, were prepared by KESH and&#13;
reviewed by the Bank. The tender documents were issued for LIB. The equipment is needed&#13;
in order to meet the distribution rehabilitation requirements for the most critical areas in the&#13;
coming winter. The use of LIB for these contracts was allowed on an exceptional basis in order&#13;
to meet the winter deadline. The contracts would be eligible for retroactive financing (para 78).&#13;
The consultant services to assist the MME to find strategic investors for the power distribution&#13;
companies and training for the Regulatory Board ($0.4 million) will also be eligible for&#13;
retroactive financing.&#13;
&#13;

H. Project Implementation&#13;
73.   KESH  and the three pilot distribution companies would be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of their respective subprojects, and would sign their respective purchase&#13;
contracts. However, KESH would handle procurement and subproject supervision of the three&#13;
pilot companies with the assistance of competent staff and consultants familiar with IDA's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. A Project Management Unit (PMU) would be set up under KESH's&#13;
management and be responsible for the rehabilitation and reinforcement of the transmission&#13;
system and distribution networks. An office of PMU, responsible for day to day management&#13;
of the unit, will be established (Annex 5.7 Attachment I). The PMU would be assisted by&#13;
consultants financed under the project. Terms of Reference for these services are in Annex 5.7.&#13;
Attachment II.&#13;
74.   Under the PMU three Implementation Units would be established: (a) the Transmission&#13;
Project Implementation Unit (TPIU); (b) the Distribution Project Implementation Unit (DPIU);&#13;
and (c) the Dispatch Center Implementation Unit (DCIU). These units would each be charged&#13;
with coordinating, supervising and monitoring the execution of the corresponding sub-project,&#13;
and report to the PMU. They would receive cross-support from other KESH departments in&#13;
selected areas, such as: engineering and technical support, legal matters, budgeting, accounting,&#13;
disbursement and cost control, scheduling, manpower allocation, and operational support.&#13;
Procurement for all Beneficiaries except MME would be carried out by KESH's Procurement&#13;
Department, under the PMU's supervision, and deliveries would be made directly to the regional&#13;
warehouses.&#13;
75.   The implementation of the sub-projects would be the responsibility of the local&#13;
transmission and distribution entities. Installation of major equipment would be done in most&#13;
instances by the suppliers, under supervision of KESH staff, line implementation agencies and&#13;
the three pilot distribution entities. Replacement of distribution equipment in operation would&#13;
be performed by the distribution companies' own maintenance staff on force account.&#13;
Rehabilitation of the existing substations and distribution networks would be carried out by force&#13;
account by KESH and its distribution entities, which have handled satisfactorily similar work&#13;
under the Critical Imports Project. Civil works construction for the new transmission lines and&#13;
substations, and some of the installation works would be carried out by local contractors which&#13;
have experience in this kind of work. MME would be responsible for implementation of the&#13;
technical assistance to be provided to the Borrower for privatization and regulatory training.&#13;
76.   KESH and the three pilot distribution companies confirmed that KESH will carry&#13;
out the implementation plan with due diligence and efficiency.&#13;
77.   The project implementation plan and the implementation schedules for the various&#13;
components of the project are set out in Annex 5.7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
I. Disbursements&#13;
78.   The IDA Credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures&#13;
for directly imported equipment and materials quoted on cif basis; (b) 100 percent of local&#13;
expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 85 percent of local expenditures for other items procured&#13;
locally; and (c) 100 percent of expenditures for consulting services and training. Disbursements&#13;
would be made against full documentation except that expenditures pertaining to contracts for&#13;
good and services less than $300,000 (except for individual consultant contracts for which the&#13;
threshold would be US$50,000 equivalent) would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures. Documentation supporting such expenditures would be retained in KESH's offices&#13;
and made available for review by IDA supervision missions. To facilitate timely project&#13;
implementation, the Borrower would establish, maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable&#13;
to IDA, a Special Account in US dollars in the Bank of Albania. During the early stage of the&#13;
project, the initial allocation of the Special Account would be limited to US$1.0 million.&#13;
However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached the level of SDR 3.2&#13;
million (US$5.0 million), the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation&#13;
of US$3 million by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment&#13;
applications should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank&#13;
statements as well as other supporting documents.   Annex 5.8 presents the disbursement&#13;
schedule for the proposed IDA Credit as well as the standard profile of disbursements for energy&#13;
sector projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region. IDA would provide retroactive financing&#13;
of up to 10% of its credit amount (about US$2.6 million). The project completion date would&#13;
be December 31, 2000, and the closing date would be June 30, 2001.&#13;
J. Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
79.   KESH and the pilot distribution companies would furnish to IDA regular half-yearly&#13;
project progress reports by July 31 and January 31 of each year, supplemented by shorter reports&#13;
to be submitted by April 30 and October 31 each year. These reports would include information&#13;
on the progress of procurement activities and project implementation, identify any problem areas&#13;
and indicate remedial action. Reports on procurement for KESH and the three pilot distribution&#13;
companies would be provided by KESH. Furthermore, an Implementation Completion Report&#13;
would be prepared by IDA and each of the Beneficiaries no later than six months after&#13;
completion of the project. The Government and each Beneficiary would also prepare a plan for&#13;
future operation of the project. The scope and content of the project progress reports were&#13;
discussed and agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;
K. Environmental Considerations&#13;
80.  In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the project has been assigned&#13;
Category B, and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared (Annex 5.9).&#13;
The EMP has been reviewed by IDA. All environmental issues are satisfactorily addressed and&#13;
in compliance with all environmental policies and procedures of the Borrower and IDA. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
project has been designed to include all mitigation and monitoring recommendations offered in&#13;
the EMP and will include a program of technical assistance (para 87).&#13;
81.   The project is a part of an overall KESH program to rehabilitate and strengthen its&#13;
distribution and transmission systems. It is supported by a number of cofinanciers. IDA&#13;
reviewed environmental aspects for all project components and believes they are either negligible&#13;
and/or will be adequately addressed by environmental policies and procedures of the other&#13;
participating development institutions.&#13;
82.   There are no nature preserves or sensitive ecosystems in proximity to the project area.&#13;
All clearing of vegetation will be done manually or mechanically. There will be no herbicide&#13;
use. Finally, since Albania is an IDA country, a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP)&#13;
has been prepared. The NEAP has been reviewed and the proposed project is consistent with&#13;
its recommendations.&#13;
83.   The project's major environmental issues identified were: resettlement of the single&#13;
family occupying KESH-owned land at the site of the new Durres substation; safety and health&#13;
considerations for illegal occupants along the current right of way of the Tirana ring connection;&#13;
possible presence of PCBs in transformers and existing distribution stations included in the&#13;
project; and possible PCB contamination of soil and groundwater at all KESH-owned transformer&#13;
stations.&#13;
84.   Resettlement of Occupant. KESH will obtain all necessary environmental clearances from&#13;
the government and provide reasonable compensation to assist the occupant in relocation in&#13;
accordance with policies and practices for resettlement.&#13;
85.   Health and Safety.     Areas heavily settled by illegal occupants will have their&#13;
transmission towers designed to ensure that extra margins of safety against mechanical failure,&#13;
and ground level electric/magnetic field intensities within internationally accepted standards.&#13;
86.   Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs).   Albania has recently banned imports of hazardous&#13;
material and wastes. However, it has no analytical capability to determine if PCBs are currently&#13;
in use, or have been used in the past. Thus, old transformers to be replaced under the project&#13;
may contain PCBs or PCB contaminated oil. If they do, these fluids must be handled and&#13;
destroyed in strict accordance with international practice. Technical assistance (para 87) would&#13;
include equipment and training for PCB analysis. Furthermore, most transformers in the KESH&#13;
system leak. If these transformers have or had PCBs, there is a strong possibility for soil and&#13;
groundwater contamination throughout the country. An overall action plan for mitigating&#13;
environmental damage from PCB releases is to be included in the technical assistance. The plan&#13;
will assess current levels of PCB related imports and if necessary recommend a cost-effective&#13;
remediation program. Terms of reference are in Annex 5.10.&#13;
87.   Details of environmentally related technical assistance are in the EMP. It will include:&#13;
management for any PCBs found in transformers to be replaced under the project, preparation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
of an action plan for mitigation of PCB-related environmental contamination, laboratory and&#13;
monitoring equipment for PCBs, electric/magnetic fields and noise, and training in use and&#13;
maintenance of this equipment. KESH agreed that: (i) it will implement both the monitoring&#13;
and mitigation plans detailed in the Environment Management Plan; (ii) undertake and&#13;
complete a study on the use of PCBs in accordance with terms of reference agreed with the&#13;
Association; (iii) upon completion of the study furnish a copy to the Association for its&#13;
comments and review; and (iv) discuss with the Association the follow-up actions, if any,&#13;
recommended by the study or the Association.&#13;
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
88.   Until recently, Albanian industry was not exposed to basic accounting and auditing&#13;
principles and practices as understood in market economies. Hence, financial, accounting, and&#13;
auditing skills are extremely scarce. Financial reporting requirements are also weak. For&#13;
example, until recently, KESH was required to produce a single annual financial statement,&#13;
somewhat similar to a balance sheet. It was not required to produce an income or a funds flow&#13;
statement. Independent audits did not exist.&#13;
89.   The new Albanian accounting law (January 1, 1994) adopted a chart of accounts similar&#13;
to the French one. Entities will now be required to present a balance sheet and an income&#13;
statement but not a funds flow statement. The new law is expected to improve the quality of&#13;
financial information, but its implementation will be hampered by the shortage of trained&#13;
accountants.&#13;
90.   KESH's present organizational structure (excluding the Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore&#13;
distribution entities) includes 32 distribution entities that were taken over in 1991. Each entity&#13;
has kept its quasi-independent status, with separate accounts, making it very difficult to&#13;
consolidate the financial statements of the KESH group.&#13;
91.   Electrowatt, with financing from the Swiss Trust Fund, helped KESH to prepare for an&#13;
independent audit of its financial statements. This technical assistance includes training in&#13;
modem accounting concepts and procedures, and the establishment of an effective internal&#13;
control system. However, the lack of counterpart staff at all levels hampered the progress of&#13;
this work. Given this, it would not be possible to have a meaningful traditional audit at the&#13;
present time. A more modest audit with considerable attention focused on providing advice to&#13;
the financial staff, and assisting them to improve present accounting rules and procedures was&#13;
considered acceptable. Agreement was reached with KESH to have its annual financial&#13;
statements (income statement, balance sheet, and funds flow statement) audited by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to IDA. The audited financial statements would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
presented to IDA within six months after the end of the riscal year. The auditor has been&#13;
appointed.&#13;
B. Need for Improved Financial Management&#13;
92.   The introduction of a computerized Management Information System was approved by&#13;
KESH on Electrowatt's recommendation. The system comprises three stages: (i) implementation&#13;
at KESH headquarters, one distribution entity and one production/transmission entity; (ii)&#13;
expansion to the other distribution and production/transmission entities; and (iii) integration of&#13;
different systems such as accounting, billing, etc. Electrowatt worked on stage 1, but this work&#13;
was also hampered by the lack of appropriate counterpart staff and the general weakness of&#13;
KESH's finance department. At present, the entire finance department depends on a few&#13;
qualified key individuals, which means that their absences and such personnel leaving the&#13;
company have major impacts. KESH needs to recruit at least four highly qualified financial and&#13;
accounting experts and should purchase at least 50 computers for its finance departments at&#13;
headquarters and in the field. However, it has been unable to recruit the needed specialists due&#13;
to both salary constraints as well as the scarcity of such people within Albania. The only&#13;
realistic option available to improve the quality of financial management at KESH is, therefore,&#13;
to have foreign firms bid for a financial management contract. KESH agreed to engage&#13;
consultants for a three year period to take full management responsibility for its rmance&#13;
department both at headquarters and in the various divisions. The consultants will also&#13;
introduce the new management information system and train KESH's fmancial staff.&#13;
Terms of reference are in Annex 6.5.&#13;
93.   The financial management consultants would have one group working at KESH&#13;
headquarters, and another group that would develop and install computer-based systems in the&#13;
distribution units. The three pilot distribution entities will not be part of this program and will&#13;
be responsible for their own financial management. However, the new accounting system&#13;
developed by Electrowatt would also be made available to them by KESH.&#13;
C. Billing System&#13;
94.   Electricity billing is done manually. Typically, in cities meters are read on a monthly&#13;
basis in the second half of the month, the bill is handed directly to the consumer by the meter&#13;
reader, and the consumer is required to pay by the end of the next month at a regional office&#13;
(there are 11 in Tirana). Payment is predominantly in cash, a fee of 1 % of the amount due per&#13;
day of delay is imposed for late payment, and the customer is disconnected after three months&#13;
of non-payment; this latter period should be shortened in order to reduce the risk of bad debts.&#13;
In rural areas meter reading, billing and collection is the responsibility of the electricians, who&#13;
bring the money collected to the payment offices on a monthly basis.&#13;
95.   The urban billing system is simple and straightforward. Its defects are largely due to&#13;
lack of a consistent and comprehensive data base and computerization. The possibilities of&#13;
carrying out controls and retrieving information for management purposes are currently very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
limited. There is ample room for error in copying data manually and for irregularities in&#13;
registering meter readings. There have been complaints of long lines at payment offices,&#13;
particularly when payment deadlines approach. Although these problems stem in part from&#13;
weaknesses of the banking sector, clearly KESH should take further measures to facilitate&#13;
payment, possibly by creating additional regional offices, introducing mobile offices, etc. This&#13;
area is expected to be given high priority by the financial consultants (para 92).&#13;
96.   The current rural billing system is unsatisfactory, as there is no way that the electricity&#13;
billed and the total sum collected can be controlled effectively with current means. The&#13;
disappearance of the rural cooperatives following the political changes in 1991 appears to have&#13;
been a major contributing factor, since they used to collect the electricity bills from consumers&#13;
and exercised social control. In an effort to reinstate the pre-1991 payment system and to&#13;
sensitize communal authorities to the potential impact of increasing non-technical losses on their&#13;
community (the power supply could be cut off) KESH proposes to transfer responsibility for&#13;
billing and collection in rural areas to the communal authorities (para 31). Should the pilot&#13;
privatization program prove to be successful, then large-scale privatization of the distribution&#13;
entities would supersede this policy.&#13;
97.   Under the Power Loss Reduction Project, a single file is to be created for each consumer.&#13;
All core consumer data and information, including information on work carried out for the&#13;
consumer, will be recorded in the file by all parties (e.g., meter readers, inspectors and&#13;
electricians). The data will be eventually transferred to a computer-based monitoring system that&#13;
could be used, inter alia, to identify changes in consumption patterns. At the same time KESH&#13;
is embarking on a pilot scheme to introduce a computerized billing system, starting in Tirana&#13;
and subsequently to be installed in other major cities.&#13;
D. Past Financial Performance&#13;
98.   To understand KESH's financial performance it must be noted that the company is still&#13;
a part of the Albanian public sector and cannot be considered an autonomous company. It works&#13;
under severe constraints, the most damaging of which is that the Government uses KESH more&#13;
as a tax collector than as the national power company. The tax authorities collect excise taxes&#13;
on all invoiced revenue from electricity sales within Albania five days after billing and&#13;
regardless of whether the bills are paid. To collect these taxes, the authorities draw directly&#13;
upon the company's bank accounts. Reportedly there have been occasions when this did not&#13;
leave sufficient money for KESH to pay salaries. Until recently the Government has also denied&#13;
KESH, with few exceptions, the ability to disconnect non-paying state-owned companies, state&#13;
institutions and local government agencies. Local government authorities have even been known&#13;
to arrest distribution company managers for having disconnected local government agencies&#13;
(street lighting, water companies, schools, hospitals, etc.). Consequently, KESH has severe cash&#13;
flow problems, with mounting debts to both suppliers and the tax authorities, and is unable to&#13;
finance its investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
99.   The financial statements of KESH  for 1992 - 1994 are shown in Annex 6.1 and&#13;
summarized in Table 6.1. This table shows that the operating ratio, including excise taxes, was&#13;
40% in 1994 while the operating ratio net of excise taxes was 76%. Considering the low&#13;
average price of 1.10 leks per kWh of electricity net of excise tax that KESH received in 1994,&#13;
this is an indication that the company has unusually low expenses for a power utility. However,&#13;
the low expenses are partly due to low provision for depreciation.&#13;

RoR on Net Fixed Assets                                      9.5%              11.2%&#13;
RoR on Equity                                                7.4%              9.0%&#13;
100.  During 1992-94, the fixed assets of KESH were valued at low historical prices. This led&#13;
to understatement of depreciation and hence overstatement of net income. During 1995, assets&#13;
were revalued upwards to 3.2 times their previous value. On the basis of comparisons with asset&#13;
values per kW in Western European power utilities, and taking into account the deteriorated&#13;
condition of KESH's power system, the revised value appears to be satisfactory.&#13;
101.  Working capital/arrears.   Table 6.2 shows that even though KESH showed a profit in&#13;
nominal terms in both 1993 and 1994, the company was unable to generate sufficient funds to&#13;
cover its operating requirements (including working capital). The consequent deficit, together&#13;
with all capital expenditures, had therefore to be financed by external sources, principally&#13;
external grants and loans, and to a lesser extent, government contributions.&#13;

102.  The principal reason for this situation was the abnormal increase in the company's&#13;
working capital during these two years. This was a result of a rapid worsening of ability or&#13;
willingness to pay, principally on the part of the state-owned companies and public sector&#13;
agencies. By the end of 1994, it took KESH on average 4.5 months to collect its bills. In the&#13;
case of certain state-owned industrial users, this period was much longer, e.g. over a year.&#13;
103. During the first quarter of 1995, KESH was able to reduce the average collection time&#13;
for household consumers and private companies by 30% (Annex 6.2). However, it was less&#13;
successful with public sector entities, whose share of accounts receivable increased from 66%&#13;
as of December 31, 1994 to 79% by March 31, 1995.&#13;
104. A number of strong measures are needed to resolve this situation. Agreement was&#13;
reached with: (i) KESH and each of the pilot distribution companies to take all steps&#13;
necessary to limit accounts receivables to two months of sales; and (ii) the Government,&#13;
KESH and the pilot distribution companies to settle henceforth all bills within six weeks.&#13;
The Government has: (i) presented a law to Parliament to eliminate the excise tax when&#13;
the value added tax (VAT) is introduced (expected by July 1, 1996), but in case the VAT&#13;
is postponed beyond July 1, 1996, by no later than January 1, 1997; and (ii) written off all&#13;
excise tax obligations by KESH and the three pilot distribution companies as of December&#13;
31, 1995. Measures are expected to be taken in the near future to write off an appropriate&#13;
amount of outstanding payables by Government entities and State industries to KESH and the&#13;
Power Corporations of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore.&#13;
105. Fiscal Impact. These measures would be fiscally sustainable. Government contributions&#13;
to KESH would no longer be needed since KESH would be assured enough revenue to cover all&#13;
all its costs including the local costs of investments (para. 109). There are important fiscal&#13;
revenue changes. However, write off of excise tax arrears will have no impact since these&#13;
arrears are not collectible. Because of the way the excise tax is collected (para. 98), the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Government has taken virtually the maximum it can get from KESH without leaving the&#13;
company sufficient funds to cover its operating costs. No further tax arrears could be collected&#13;
unless the Government and State industries could pay their arrears to KESH. However they are&#13;
unable to do so; hence their arrears to KESH and the three pilot distribution companies will be&#13;
written off. Elimination of the excise tax on KESH will reduce excise tax revenue, but the&#13;
Government will get from KESH the proceeds of the 12.5% VAT plus dividends as long as&#13;
KESH is state-owned, in essence all funds over and above what is necessary for KESH to cover&#13;
its operating costs, debt service and the local costs of its urgently needed investments. Although&#13;
the excise tax rates on KESH has been reduced three times from 2.7 leks per kWh in April 1994&#13;
to 1.3 leks in January 1996, the way the tax has been collected has deprived KESH of sufficient&#13;
funds to pay all the local costs of its planned investments. To this extent, continued imposition&#13;
of the excise tax could lead to more Government revenue temporarily than the sum of VAT plus&#13;
dividends. But this practice could not continue without serious adverse effects on the power&#13;
sector and eventual fiscal revenue loss. The forecast of total Government revenue in paragraph&#13;
107 would be the same with or without the excise tax as long as it is assumed that KESH is left&#13;
with enough revenue to cover the local costs of its investment program. While KESH could&#13;
increase its investment program more easily under the new arrangements, the Government as&#13;
owner (represented by the Ministry of Finance) has the power to prevent this if it wishes,&#13;
although the program is already too small (para. 42). In the longer term the new arrangements&#13;
could well result in greater fiscal revenue than the excise tax approach by giving KESH more&#13;
incentive to reduce non-technical electricity losses and more resources to make the investments&#13;
necessary to increase electricity sales.&#13;
E. Financial Forecasts&#13;
106.  A major project objective is to enhance the financial performance of KESH, so that&#13;
appropriate electric power facilities can be built and maintained. The financial projections for&#13;
the period 1995-2002 (Annex 6.1) are based on the following principal assumptions: (i) the&#13;
distribution enterprises of Elbasan, Shkoder, and Vlore are not included in KESH's accounts;&#13;
(ii) the retail price per kWh would be increased to an average of 4.5 leks in 1996 and thereafter&#13;
remain constant in real terms; (iii) the excise tax would be eliminated in 1996 and a 12.5 %&#13;
VAT would be introduced; and (iv) total electricity demand within Albania would remain&#13;
constant and transmission and distribution losses would be reduced from 48% of net generation&#13;
in 1994 to 22% in 2002. KESH's financing plan during 1996-2001 is summarized in Table 6.3.&#13;

generation. Assuming that all free cash flow not required to cover the local costs of investments&#13;
is paid out in dividends to the Government, this ratio would go down to 36%. In combination&#13;
with the proceeds from the income tax and the VAT paid by KESH, this would result in very&#13;
large revenues for the Government, increasing from about 3.4 billion leks in 1996 to 6.9 billion&#13;
leks in 2002. About one-third of these amounts would be dividends. However, given that the&#13;
forecast investment expenditures constitute a very minimal program, self-financing requirements&#13;
may increase in the future. In this case, dividend payments would be reduced to meet the&#13;
company's increased cash flow requirements.&#13;
108. Table 6.4 shows forecast indicators of KESH's financial performance through 2002. The&#13;
operating ratio would decrease from 83 % in 1995 to 65 % in 1996 and then stabilize at a level&#13;
between 56% and 60%. This decrease is due to the replacement in 1996 of the excise tax by a&#13;
VAT of 12.5%. It would have been even lower if it were not for the 1995 revaluation of fixed&#13;
assets to 3.2 times their previously reported value resulting in increased depreciation charges.&#13;
Both the elimination of the excise tax and the revaluation of the fixed assets will have a positive&#13;
effect on cash flow. This will not be seen in the net internal cash generation estimates,&#13;
however, as all cash surplus not needed to finance the domestic part of the investment program&#13;
will be set aside as dividends. This policy, in combination with increased borrowing, will make&#13;
the debt/equity ratio rise from 0.18 in 1996 to 0.69 in 2002. Debt service coverage is projected&#13;
to diminish as principal repayments become more important.&#13;

109. KESH agreed to: (i) generate funds from internal sources sufficient to obtain a 40%&#13;
net internal cash generation ratio based on its three-year moving average investment&#13;
requirements (the previous, current and next year); (ii) maintain a debt service coverage&#13;
ratio of at least 2.0 times the annual debt service, and (iii) present to IDA, by September&#13;
30 of each year, its estimated flnancial statements for the current year and the forecasts for&#13;
the next year. The projected net internal cash generation and debt service coverage indicators&#13;
in Table 6.4 would meet these targets when dividends are included. These are assumed to be&#13;
paid at the end of each year once all higher priority commitments are satisfied.&#13;
F. Managing Surplus Cash&#13;
110.  At the present time KESH does not have the necessary procedures in place to manage the&#13;
cash surplus that is expected to result from replacing the excise tax with VAT in early 1996.&#13;
KESH agreed to: (i) by January 1, 1996, establish an escrow account at a commercial bank;&#13;
(ii) thereafter deposit all cash not needed for payment of current liabilities other than those&#13;
under (iii) into this account at the beginning of each month; and (Wii) use the proceeds of&#13;
the escrow account for payment of taxes and import duties, debt service, local costs of&#13;
investments and such other purposes as may be agreed to by the Association. The&#13;
disposable portion of the balance in the account should be invested in appropriate instruments,&#13;
e.g., Albanian Treasury Bills.&#13;
G. Pilot Distribution Enterprises&#13;
111.  For the privatization of the three distribution enterprises to be successful, it will be&#13;
necessary to provide strong incentives. These should make it financially worthwhile for&#13;
investors to speedily reduce their energy losses and induce customers to pay on time. The three&#13;
distribution enterprises should be allowed to make potentially large profits during the initial five-&#13;
year period, providing they exceed the minimum targets set out in their licenses (para 59).&#13;
112.  A margin was assumed between the bulk and retail prices for the pilot distribution&#13;
enterprises sufficient to produce an internal net cash generation that would cover the local costs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
of the enterprises' miniimum agreed investments, assuming 42% distribution losses and 2.5&#13;
months accounts receivable (defined as the break-even point). If, as expected, the enterprises&#13;
bring their energy losses and accounts receivable below these levels they would show large&#13;
profits that could be retained or distributed, subject to the minimum agreed investment program&#13;
being carried out.&#13;
113.  Preliminary calculations indicate that the margin required for the three distribution&#13;
companies, excluding excise tax or VAT, would be 2.70 leks per kWh in 1996 and thereafter&#13;
adjusted annually for inflation. The financial projections in Annex 6.3 assume that the privatized&#13;
distribution entities bring total distribution losses down to 18% of purchased electricity over a&#13;
five-year period. The results for the three companies are similar and satisfactory.&#13;

114.   The Government agreed to: (1) rfx the distribution margins of the Power&#13;
Corporations of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore at an initial level sufficient to allow the entities&#13;
to cover the local costs of the investment program agreed with IDA, provided distribution&#13;
losses are reduced to 42% of electricity entering their distribution networks and accounts&#13;
receivable are reduced to 2.5 months of billing; and (ii) implement a mechanism to provide&#13;
for automatic adjustment of the margins with respect to inflation, real changes in the bulk&#13;
supply price and efficiency improvements over a five year period designed to ensure&#13;
continued fulfillment of these conditions. These agreements have been incorporated in the&#13;
distribution licenses. The Power Corporations of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore agreed to&#13;
take all necessary steps to ensure that: (i) internally generated annual cash surplus will be&#13;
sufficient to cover the local costs of planned investments agreed with IDA; and (ii) their&#13;
debt service coverage will be 2.0 or higher. The Power Corporations agreed to have their&#13;
financial statements audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA. The audited&#13;
financial statements should be presented to IDA within 6 months after the end of each fiscal&#13;
year. The auditor has been appointed.&#13;
H. Insurance&#13;
115. KESH and the pilot distribution companies are self insured. This arrangement is used in&#13;
many other power utilities and is acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Benefits and Costs&#13;
116. The institutional components of the proposed project would provide the following benefits:&#13;
(i) reduction in non-technical losses resulting in increased electricity revenue and reduced&#13;
uneconomic electricity use; (ii) improved electricity bill collection; (iii) improved financial&#13;
performance of KESH and the pilot distribution companies; (iv) a regulatory framework that&#13;
would provide a welcoming environment for private investors and operators; and (v) energy&#13;
conservation and efficiency improvements in electrical appliances and buildings. These benefits&#13;
have not been quantified for purposes of the economic rate of return calculation.&#13;
117. The physical components would provide the following benefits: (i) reduction in technical&#13;
transmission and distribution losses; (ii) enhanced reliability through reduction in power outages&#13;
and improvement in voltage stability; (iii) increase in capacity to transmit and distribute&#13;
electricity; (iv) improved assurance of safe transfers of energy through the Albania-Greece&#13;
interconnection (an outage on this interconnection at a time when electricity imports are needed&#13;
would impose a large cost on Albanian consumers); (v) reduction in operating costs and&#13;
maintenance because of reduced need to repair damaged equipment; and (vi) environmental&#13;
benefits resulting from a reduced need for power produced by existing thermal plants using high-&#13;
sulfur heavy fuel oil.&#13;
118.  Quantitative estimates in gigawatt-hours were made for reductions in technical losses and&#13;
outages.  These reductions were estimated by taking the difference between two system&#13;
simulation results of two scenarios based on the demand figures of 1994, one assuming&#13;
implementation of the proposed project, the other without. This approach yields conservative&#13;
estimates since no account was taken of the fact that an increase in demand on the&#13;
unstrengthened system would result in higher losses. Increased supply capacity, which would&#13;
be a byproduct of the investments needed for system strengthening, would provide a benefit if&#13;
there were an increase in demand. However, this benefit was not evaluated because of the large&#13;
uncertainty about demand growth (para 39).&#13;
119.  The loss reductions in transmission were valued at the long-run marginal cost of&#13;
generation; in distribution at the long-run marginal cost of generation plus transmission. The&#13;
benefit of reduced outages was measured by the outage reduction in kilowatt hours valued at a&#13;
cost of unserved energy conservatively estimated at US$ 0.25 per kWh. Before choosing this&#13;
figure an estimate was made of the cost of operating a backup diesel generator during periods&#13;
of outage. On the basis of an estimated average 243 hours of outage per year in the areas that&#13;
would benefit from the proposed project, this cost would be US$0.53 per kWh. Since only a&#13;
fraction of consumers affected by outages buy backup generators, it was decided to fix the cost&#13;
of unserved energy at the much lower value of US$0.25 per kWh. This figure was chosen at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
a level below estimates of costs of unserved electrical energy for other countries in order to&#13;
avoid any possible bias towards overestimating the economic rate of return. The costs to be&#13;
compared to the above benefits are the estimated financial costs of the proposed project&#13;
excluding price contingencies. There would be no import duties on equipment imported under&#13;
the project. Shadow prices were not used in the base case since the differences from actual&#13;
prices would be small and the estimates subject to considerable uncertainties. For example, the&#13;
shadow exchange rate would likely differ from the actual rate by no more than 10%. The main&#13;
source of distortion which would in principle justify a shadow price below the actual, the import&#13;
tariff, is only about 10% of the value of imports on average.&#13;
120. Internal economic rates of return were calculated for all the individual project components&#13;
for which benefit estimates were made and for the total project. The estimated internal rate of&#13;
return for the total project is 24%, which is higher than the opportunity cost of capital for&#13;
Albania, taken as 12%. Sensitivity tests were carried out with respect to changes in key&#13;
parameters. The changes needed to reduce the rate of return to 12% are: 70% less outage&#13;
reduction, or 80% higher project costs, or a five-year delay in benefits. With zero loss&#13;
reduction the rate of return would be 18%. Use of a shadow exchange rate 10% lower than the&#13;
actual would reduce the rate of return to 22%. Detailed results are given in Annex 7.1.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
121.  The project is not expected to have detrimental effects on the environment and presents&#13;
no physical risks, since construction and rehabilitation of standard transmission, distribution and&#13;
dispatching facilities are involved.  Delays in project implementation could arise due to&#13;
inadequate availability of counterpart funds when needed; this risk would be addressed through&#13;
abolition of the excise tax and adherence to agreed financial covenants. Delays or changes in&#13;
project scope could result from failure to mobilize the expected cofinancing on time, or to obtain&#13;
on time the rights-of-way for three transmission lines. These risks would be addressed through&#13;
provision for resort to IDA's remedies, but even with delays, the project investments are viable.&#13;
The project could be jeopardized if unpaid electricity consumption continues to increase. This&#13;
risk would be reduced by implementation of the Power Loss Reduction Project, by strengthened&#13;
law enforcement and by privatization. Delays could also be caused by problems arising during&#13;
the transition from public to private ownership. These would be minimized by joint procurement&#13;
of equipment items by KESH. The risk of privatization of the entire distribution sector failing&#13;
is minimized by having first a pilot program involving only three distribution companies and&#13;
then base further action on a careful review of experience gained under the pilot program. The&#13;
risks are discussed further in Annex 7.2.&#13;
&#13;

e.    (i) have its financial statements audited by an independent auditor acceptable to&#13;
IDA; and (ii) furnish the audited financial statements to IDA within six months&#13;
after the end of the fiscal year (para 91) (KESH Agreement, 4.01(b));&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
f.    (i) take the necessary steps to reduce average accounts receivable to two months&#13;
of sales; and (ii) settle all bills within six weeks (para 104) (KESH Agreement,&#13;

those under (iii) into this account at the beginning of each month; and (iii) use the&#13;
proceeds of the escrow account for payment of taxes and import duties, debt&#13;
service, local costs of investments and such other purposes as may be agreed to&#13;
by the Association (para 110) (KESH Agreement, 4.10); and&#13;
i.    engage consultants to take responsibility for the finance department both at&#13;
headquarters and in the divisions for a three year period (para 92) (Credit&#13;
Agreement, Schedule 2, Part A (2)).&#13;
(C)   With the Power Corporations of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore:&#13;
a.    same as above agreements with KESH for a, e, f and g(ii) (paras 104 and 114)&#13;
(Elbasan. Shkoder and Vlore Agreements. 4.01(a), 4.03(a), 4.04(a) and (b), and&#13;
4.05); and&#13;
b.    take all necessary steps to ensure that internally generated annual cash surplus&#13;
will be sufficient to cover the local costs of planned investments agreed with IDA&#13;
(para 114) (Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore Agreements, 4.02(a)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Remedies of IDA&#13;
123. IDA could invoke its remedies if:&#13;
a.    effectiveness of the OECF and Swiss cofinancing is not obtained by April 30,&#13;
1996 (para 66) (Credit Agreement, 5.01 (h)).&#13;
b.   the distribution licenses or any regulatory enactments have been amended,&#13;
repealed, abrogated, suspended or waived so as to affect materially and adversely&#13;
the ability of the pilot companies to perform their obligations under the Project&#13;
Agreements (para 59) (Credit Agreement, 5.01(d), (e) and (f))&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
124.  On the basis of the above-mentioned agreements, the proposed project would be suitable&#13;
for an IDA credit of SDR 19.7 million (US$29.5 million equivalent) under standard IDA terms,&#13;
with a 40 year maturity, to the Government of Albania.&#13;

Transmission Rehabilitation and Upgrading Program&#13;
(1994- 2005)&#13;
Present System&#13;
1.    The present bulk power transmission system of the Albanian Electric Power System is&#13;
composed of a mesh 220 kV network, which serves through six substations the 110/35 kV&#13;
subtransmission facilities. The 1 10 kV transmission lines are operated as radial circuits.&#13;
2.    The 220 kV system's primary function is the interconnection of the three large hydro&#13;
power plants on the Drin River, in the northern area of Albania, to the major load centers of&#13;
Tirana, Elbasan, and Fier in the central region of Albania. The total capacity of the Drin River&#13;
hydroelectric plants is 1,350 MW, which is approximately 93 percent of the total hydroelectric&#13;
capacity of Albania of 1,444 MW. The thermal generating capacity is only 218 MW. The&#13;
largest thermal plant at Fier has a capacity of 160 MW.&#13;
3.    The 220 kV network is interconnected with the former Yugoslavian network (at two tie&#13;
points) and with the Greek network through a 220/400 kV autotransformer. The 220 kV lines&#13;
have a total length of 1, 100 km. The thermal limit of the 220 kV lines ranges from 270 to 380&#13;
MVA.&#13;
4.    The radial 110 kV transmission lines are served from six 220/110 kV substations. The&#13;
autotransformers of these substations have a total capacity 870 MVA.  None of these&#13;
transformers are equipped with automatic tap changing facilities. Further, no capacitors are&#13;
installed in these substations. The 110 kV lines have a total length of 1,180 km. Their thermal&#13;
limit ranges from 65 MVA to 120 MVA. These limited capacities result in excessive voltage&#13;
drops, overload conditions, and excessive losses on key 110 kV lines. The 110 kV system&#13;
serves the system load through some 60 substations, which are normally equipped with two or&#13;
three transformers ranging in capacity from 3.2 MVA to 20 MVA. None of these transformers&#13;
are equipped with automatic tap changing facilities.&#13;
5.    Most of the equipment in the 220 and 110 kV substations is of older Chinese, Russian,&#13;
or Yugoslavian manufacture. Many substations, as a result, require substantial rehabilitation.&#13;
However, spare parts are no longer available. Furthermore, there has not been adequate&#13;
rehabilitation, reinforcement, and development of the transmission facilities, particularly of the&#13;
110 kV, to meet current requirements. This situation has persisted for fifteen years resulting&#13;
in serious reliability problems and uneconomic operations.&#13;
&#13;

Rehabilitation and Reinforcement Plan&#13;
6.    A Power Transmission System Feasibility Study, prepared by Electroconsult of Italy in&#13;
1993, developed a long-term plan for the rehabilitation, upgrading, and expansion of the&#13;
Albanian transmission system to provide for reliable and economic operation by the year 2000&#13;
and to meet expected load demand forecasted for the year 2005.&#13;
7.   It was established at the outset of the transmission study that the system would be&#13;
designed based on the following criteria: (i) the 110 kV should to the extent feasible be&#13;
interconnected to operate as a mesh similar to the 220 kV; (ii) a single contingency including&#13;
the outage of a 220 kV line, a 110 kV line or a substation transformer should not cause a&#13;
thermal overload or the curtailment of load; (iii) new 110 kV transformers should be either 16,&#13;
25 or 40 MVA with an overload capability of 30 percent and be supplied with automatic tap&#13;
changing under load equipment; (iv) the minimum and maximum operating range of the 110 kV&#13;
shall be 105 kV and 125 kV with a normal level of 117 kV; and the minimum or maximum&#13;
voltage level shall not be exceeded for any single contingency; (v) the minimum and maximum&#13;
operating range of the 220 kV shall be 209 kV and 245 kV with a normal level of 240 kv; and&#13;
the minimum or maximum voltage level shall not be exceeded for any single contingency; and&#13;
(vi) the system shall not cascade in to a major outage for a three phase fault that would result&#13;
in the loss of the largest generator or loss of a major 220 kV line.&#13;
8.    Simulations of the operation of the Albanian power system demonstrated that the existing&#13;
220 kV bulk transmission system, in its present configuration, is adequate to meet the load&#13;
requirements of the year 2005. The major problems are almost exclusively due to the&#13;
inadequacy of the 110 kV transmission facilities and the limitation of the 220/110 kV&#13;
transformer capacity.&#13;
9.    Based on the study, system components required rehabilitation and reinforcement were&#13;
identified and the following transmission system rehabilitation and upgrading program was&#13;
prepared:&#13;

10.   The total investments for the program are estimated to be about US$100 million. The&#13;
first phase rehabilitation and reinforcement, estimated cost of about US$50 million, will be&#13;
included under the proposed project. The following are the major components:&#13;
(i) 220 kV transmission line to connect Elbasan 1 and Elbasan 2 substations. A short&#13;
(4 km) line between Elbasan 1 and Elbasan 2 substations would be constructed. This&#13;
would eliminate the bottleneck that can occur on the 220 kV system in the exchange of&#13;
energy with Greece over the 400 kV tie line, and thus strengthen the 220 kV&#13;
transmission system, improve system reliability, and ensure safe transfers of energy&#13;
through the Albania-Greece interconnection;&#13;
(ii) Elbasan-Cerrik-Korce 110 kV line. The southeastern area of Albania is served by a&#13;
single circuit 110 kV line from Elbasan to Cerrik to Korce. This line experiences&#13;
excessive voltage drops of up to 15 percent and losses of up to ten times normal.&#13;
Construction of a second 110 kV transmission line is proposed to upgrade service to&#13;
relieve serious loading and voltage conditions. The investments to meet acceptable&#13;
operating criteria include: (a) construction of a 110 kV line from Elbasan to Cerrik&#13;
(10 km), and from Cerrik to Korce (95 km); and (b) installation of capacitors with a total&#13;
capacity of 30 MVAR at Cerrik and Pogradec;&#13;
(iii) Reinforcement of the Tirana-Selite-Traktori Ring connection (Tirana Ring Connection).&#13;
The load demand in Tirana area is fed by the three substations of Tirana, Selite and&#13;
Traktori. The three substations are interconnected through a 110 kV ring connection.&#13;
The existing ring coinection lines are seriously overloaded, causing excessive losses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                         Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
To reinforce the ring connection for avoiding thermal overloading in case of outage of&#13;
one side of the ring, new 110 kV lines (with a total length of about 30 km) will be&#13;
constructed. They will be parallel to the existing ring connection lines, mainly using the&#13;
same right-of-way.&#13;
(iv) Durres 220/110 kV substation. The Tirana-Durres area is served currently by the Tirana&#13;
220/110 kV substation with two 90 MVA autotransformers which are fully loaded. The&#13;
loss of one autotransformer forces KESH to interrupt loads. In addition, the 110 kV line&#13;
from Tirana to Durres is seriously overloaded, although the 220 kV line from Tirana to&#13;
Fier is underutilized. In order to ensure power supply in the Tirana-Durres area, it is&#13;
necessary to construct a new 220/110 kV substation in Durres with two 90 MVA&#13;
autotransformers. The new Durres substation would improve the power supply to the&#13;
Tirana-Durres area, and strengthen the 110 kV supply north and south of Durres;&#13;
(v) Reinforcement of existing high voltage substations would consist of:&#13;
(a)   replacement of existing aging transformers. The autotransformers of five key 110&#13;
kV substations serving distribution systems are overloaded. The loss of one&#13;
transformer in a substation would require load interruption. To reduce excessive&#13;
losses and improve reliability, the existing aging transformers would be replaced&#13;
with the following 110 kV transformers equipped with automatic tap changing&#13;
facilities: (i) Traktori Substation - two 40 MVA transformers; (ii) Selite&#13;
Substation - one 40 MVA transformer; (iii) Shkozet Substation - two 40 MVA&#13;
each transformers; (iv) Shkoder Substations: two 25 MVA each transformers; and&#13;
(v) Kavaje Substation - two 25 MVA  each transformers.  Replaced old&#13;
transformers would be repaired and used in minor load centers.&#13;
(b)   replacement of obsolete switchgear. The replacement of three 220 kV and 40&#13;
110 kV obsolete Russian, Chinese and Yugoslav switchgears and line distance&#13;
protection throughout the system is considered urgent to maintain power supply&#13;
reliability; and&#13;
(vi) Inventory Build-up. Insufficient maintenance and inadequate expenditures on spare parts&#13;
over a number of years have led to deterioration of transmission and distribution&#13;
facilities. Stocks of spare parts in most of the transmission and distribution entities are&#13;
critically low and many items are completely out of stock. The project would include&#13;
supply of special tools for maintenance and critical spare parts to reestablish sufficient&#13;
stock levels for two years, at the time of project completion, for substations, transmission&#13;
and distribution facilities.&#13;

ALBANIA - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
Upgrading of Power System Dispatching&#13;
Current Structure&#13;
1.    The operation of the Albanian electric power system is controlled and coordinated&#13;
through a National Dispatch Center (NDC). A second level of control is provided through 11&#13;
Regional Dispatch Centers (RDCs). The personnel of the RDC's are the same as those that&#13;
perform normal power plant and substation operating and maintenance activities.&#13;
2.    The NDC, located in Tirana, is responsible for monitoring and analysis of real-time&#13;
system conditions, operations planning, reliability assessment, interchange negotiations and fault&#13;
and protection operations. The NDC has decision-making authority and works closely with the&#13;
personnel in the 11 RDCs to provide for the overall coordination and control of the Albanian&#13;
electric power system.&#13;
3.    The RDC personnel are responsible for notifying the NDC of system disturbances and&#13;
alarms, the retransmission of NDC dispatching orders and the collection of historical data.&#13;
These activities are in addition to normal plant and substation operating and maintenance&#13;
activities performed by the RDC personnel. Communications between the NDC and 11 RDCs&#13;
is accomplished by telephone. The NDC relies almost completely on the RDCs for real-time&#13;
information regarding the present operating status of the system. In addition, the reliability of&#13;
the telephone system for NDC-RDC communication is poor.&#13;
4.    A Yugoslavian manufactured load frequency control system is operational at the Vau j&#13;
Dejes hydroelectric power station. The actual interchange flows on each interconnection are&#13;
transmitted to the station for use by the load frequency control system. The interchange flows&#13;
also are transmitted to the NDC. A local reading of frequency is available at the NDC. No&#13;
regulating signals are sent to the NDC. When required, the regulating parameters are adjusted&#13;
by the Vau j Dejes RDC operator in accordance with instructions from the NDC. The inability&#13;
to directly set load frequency control parameters results in serious deviations in interchange&#13;
schedules.&#13;
5.    The NDC dispatching staff has two personal computers and a terminal to the corporate&#13;
mainframe computer. These are used for load flow calculations to analysis current and future&#13;
system conditions and for computing daily and annual energy production. This facility does not&#13;
meet standard security requirements. Further, it is remote from the 220 kV and power line&#13;
carrier facilities increasing the serial communications links to the NDC and in turn decreasing&#13;
system reliability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                        Annex 5.2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
6.    The inadequacy of the load frequency system and the lack of real-time readings of the&#13;
220 kV network are serious shortcomings which prevent the NDC operators from taking&#13;
appropriate and quick action to maintain system reliability and economy. These shortcomings&#13;
also would prevent KESH from establishing stronger interconnection with the West European&#13;
Power Pool (UCPTE) and qualifying for membership.&#13;
Upgrading of System Control Facilities&#13;
7.    The proposed facilities will be designed to provide the basic real-time functions of data&#13;
acquisition, load frequency control, event recording and data logging. These programs will be&#13;
supplemented with the load flow, short and medium term forecasting and other related programs&#13;
currently run off-line.&#13;
8.    The proposed facilities will include:&#13;
(a)   a new dispatch center located at the Tirana 220 kV substation;&#13;
(b)   a computer system facility;&#13;
(c)   an upgraded telecommunication system; and&#13;
(d)   nine peripheral stations including remote terminal units (RTUs) installed in the&#13;
220 and 400 kV substations.&#13;
9.    New Dispatch Center (NDC). The new layout for the NDC will have 400 to 500 square&#13;
meters of space for the control room, programming offices, meeting room, and laboratory, as&#13;
well as to meet the requirements for telecommunications, inverters, batteries, air-conditioning&#13;
and related equipment.&#13;
10.   Computer System Facility. The proposed computer system facility will include redundant&#13;
RISC-type processors, an engineering workstation for system configuration and three operator&#13;
workstations for the man-machine interface. High resolution color monitors are proposed along&#13;
with appropriate keyboards and cursor control devices. The operating system and related&#13;
support software will be based on open architecture providing for future development and&#13;
expansion without replacing the initial system. A local area network will be used to interconnect&#13;
the components of the computer system. The major application programs will include data&#13;
acquisition, alarm processing, information storage and reporting, event recording and logging,&#13;
and load frequency control. The major advanced application will be state estimation. The state&#13;
estimation will provide the real-time data for security analysis and operations planning.&#13;
11.   Peripheral Stations. Each peripheral station will include a remote terminal unit (RTU)&#13;
and an interface panel. A peripheral station will be provided for each 220 kV substation (nine)&#13;
and provide the following real-time readings:&#13;
(a)   220/400 kV circuit breakers and disconnect switches;&#13;
(b)   110 kV circuit breakers and disconnect switches in the 220 kV substations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                          Annex 5.2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
(c)   active and reactive power flow measurements on 220/400 kV lines, on 110 kV&#13;
feeders, on autotransformers and from the generators;&#13;
(d)   400/220/110 kV bus voltages;&#13;
(e)   current measurements; and&#13;
(f)   kilowatthour readings on interconnection ties with foreign systems.&#13;
12.   Telecommunications System. The telecommunications network will be based exclusively&#13;
on power line carrier connections between the nine existing 220 kV substations. The network&#13;
will provide:&#13;
(a)     data transmission for telecontrol equipment through 200 bits/seconds telegraphic&#13;
channels;&#13;
(b)     data transmission for present teleprotection equipment;&#13;
(c)     data transmission for existing backup load frequency system at Vau j Dejes&#13;
through the telegraphic channels;&#13;
(d)     voice channels for the Public Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX) facilities&#13;
installed at each 220 kV substation; and&#13;
(e)     direct point-to-point voice channels between the NDC and strategic sites.&#13;
Rehabilitation and upgrading of the power line carrier links are now underway. These works&#13;
are being carried out by KESH, under IDA financed Critical Import project, and will be&#13;
continued until the final configuration is completed. Data transmission between the NDC and&#13;
the proposed RTUs will be carried out through 200 bits per second full duplex telegraphic&#13;
channels organized in a three ring structure. This guarantees an alternative route for each RTU.&#13;
Justification for the Upgrading of the System Control Facilities&#13;
13.   The proposed system control facilities will provide the opportunity to significantly&#13;
increase the operating reliability and economy of the electric power system. At present, no&#13;
information is available in real-time regarding the primary generation and transmission facilities.&#13;
This makes it impossible for the operators to quickly analyze current conditions and to take&#13;
appropriate action to maintain operating reliability and economy. The proposed data acquisition&#13;
facilities along with the state estimation program will provide the necessary real-time data to&#13;
meet this requirement. The proposed load frequency system, will enable the operators to adhere&#13;
more closely to interchange schedules, increasing the availability of generation for export.&#13;

ALBANIA - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
Distribution Networks Rehabilitation and Upgrading Program&#13;
(1994 - 2005)&#13;
Present State&#13;
1.    The present power distribution facilities of the Albanian Electric Power System serve&#13;
over 600,000 industry, commercial, and residential customers throughout Albania. The current&#13;
population of Albania is about 3.1 million people. The average number of users per square&#13;
kilometer is approximately a third of typical populated countries, and the number of inhabitants&#13;
per square kilometer about half. These lower user and population densities require greater&#13;
investment per customer. The primary cables and overhead feeders of the distribution system&#13;
are either 10 kV or 6 kV. The distribution facilities are supplied primarily from the 35 kV&#13;
subtransmission system, which in turn is supplied from the 220 kV and 110 kV systems.&#13;
2.    The present distribution facilities are in extremely poor condition due to the long period&#13;
of isolation, as well as the poor economic conditions of the country itself. The distribution&#13;
equipment obtained from the former Soviet Union up to 1973, and from China starting in 1973,&#13;
is for the most part 20 to 30 years old and to a large degree obsolete. Extreme overload&#13;
conditions resulted during the severe winter of 1991-1992 when extensive use was made of&#13;
electric heating that here-to-fore had been restricted by the lack of electric heaters and other&#13;
appliances. At the same time, there was widespread tampering of metering and supply facilities&#13;
that lead to an estimated 40 percent loss of total supply to the system, with about half of the&#13;
losses being non-technical. These conditions resulted in extensive damage to the distribution&#13;
facilities, particularly in the main cities. Approximately 30 percent of the existing 35/10 kV and&#13;
35/6 kV transformers were destroyed, many substations were set on fire and a large number of&#13;
low voltage (LV) cables were damaged. The technical losses of those facilities that remained&#13;
in operation were three times higher than normal due to the excessive loading conditions.&#13;
Rehabilitation and Upgrading Plan&#13;
3.    A Power Distribution System Feasibility Study was prepared by Electroconsult of Italy&#13;
in 1993. It was recognized at the outset that to meet long term demands with satisfactory service&#13;
reliability, it would require substantial investments (estimated at about US$200 million) in a&#13;
relative short time period. A plan was devised that could be financeable. This plan followed&#13;
the following guidelines: (i) the distribution facilities serving the three main cities of Tirana,&#13;
Shkoder, and Durres would be rehabilitated and upgraded to meet load demands for the year&#13;
2005 and provide a satisfactory level of service in the future. In view of the extent of the&#13;
requirements to replace obsolete and inadequate facilities, consideration was given to gradually&#13;
introducing 20 kV as a substitute for the existing double voltage levels of 35/10 kV and 35/6 kV&#13;
currently used; (ii) the distribution facilities serving a second group of smaller cities of Elbasan,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                          Annex 5.3&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Fier, Vlore, Korce, Berati, Diber, Lushnje, Gjirokaster, Rescen, Lac, Sarande, and Lezhe would&#13;
be rehabilitated to meet load demands for the year 2005 by replacing only those components that&#13;
are totally inadequate; (iii) the remaining portion of the distribution facilities serving low density&#13;
and rural areas would be kept in operation utilizing equipment obtained from the replacement&#13;
of facilities that originally served the main or secondary cities; and (iv) 110/20 kV and&#13;
110/35 kV transformers will be equipped with tap-changing-under-load facilities to compensate&#13;
for 110 kV voltage variations and to independently regulate the 20 kV and 35 kV bus voltages.&#13;
In the cases where the existing 110/35 kV/ transformers are to be retained in operation, reactive&#13;
compensation will be used to regulate bus voltages.&#13;
Distribution Networks Rehabilitation Under the Project&#13;
4.    The rehabilitation of selected distribution networks is needed to prevent further damage.&#13;
This is a part of the above rehabilitation program. Estimated cost is about US$60 million. The&#13;
most critical areas in Tirana, Durres, Shkoder, Elbasan, Vlore, and few other major load centers&#13;
were selected. Distribution networks in these areas are between 25 and 45 years old, were&#13;
designed for much smaller loads than those they are presently serving, and are seriously&#13;
overloaded. The interruption rate of supply to these areas as the result of cable faults is 100 to&#13;
120 failures per 100 kilometers per year. This is about 16 to 20 times the European experience&#13;
of 6 failures per 100 kilometers per year. In order to avoid further deterioration, improve&#13;
distribution reliability, and reduce technical losses in these distribution networks, urgent&#13;
rehabilitation and reinforcement are required. This component would include introduction of&#13;
a 20 kV single medium-voltage level to replace the existing multiple medium-voltage levels of&#13;
6, 10, 35/10, and 35/6 kV in the distribution grids of Tirana, Durres and Shkoder, where load&#13;
densities are highest and facilities are aging, and rehabilitation of the 35 kV and 35/6 kV&#13;
networks in a few selected major load centers:&#13;
(i)    Tirana:  the areas selected for rehabilitation in Tirana are located in the northern,&#13;
eastern, and western parts of the city supplied by Tirana, Selite, and Traktori&#13;
220/110 kV primary substations. They are occupied by mainly government institutions,&#13;
commercial and residential buildings including high rise apartments of up to six stories.&#13;
Due to overloading, service to these high load density areas cannot be maintained without&#13;
load curtailment. The rehabilitation works would cover supply and installation of 27&#13;
units of medium-voltage metal-clad switchgear, replacement of 320 MV/LV substations,&#13;
construction of 80 new MV/LV substations, and supply and installation of about 65 km&#13;
of 20 kV cable and about 130 km of LV cable;&#13;
(ii)   Shkoder: areas selected for Shkoder are in the northeast and southwest parts of the city.&#13;
New five and six story residential apartments have been constructed in these areas. The&#13;
construction has taken place without corresponding upgrading of the distribution facilities&#13;
serving these areas, which are served by cable feeders from the Shkoder 1 and 2 primary&#13;
substations. The feeder cables are at their thermal limit and voltage drops are about&#13;
sixteen percent. The interruption rate of supply to the service areas as the result of low&#13;
voltage network faults is about 200 failures per 100 kilometers per year. The point has&#13;
been reached where rehabilitation action can no longer be put off. The rehabilitation&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

works would cover supply and installation of 10 units of MV metal-clad switchgear,&#13;
replacement of 100 MV/LV substations, construction of 30 new MV/LV substations, and&#13;
supply and installation of about 30 km of 20 kV cable and about 60 km of LV cable;&#13;
(iii) Durres: the eastern part of Durres was selected for emergency rehabilitation. The area&#13;
supplied by the Shkozet primary substation has experienced significant load growth as&#13;
the result of the construction of a large number of residential buildings, expansion of port&#13;
facilities, and establishment of new commercial enterprises. The construction has taken&#13;
place during the past two decades without upgrading the distribution facilities serving the&#13;
area. Voltage drop in this area is as high as seventeen percent. The rehabilitation works&#13;
would include supply and installation of 5 units of MV/LV metal-clad switchgear,&#13;
replacement of 18 MV/LV substations, construction of 12 new MV/LV substations, and&#13;
supply and installation of about 10 km of 20 kV cable and about 20 km of LV cable;&#13;
(iv)   Elbasan: Elbasan is a major industrial center in Albania. The city and the rural area are&#13;
supplied by the Fibra (110/6 kV), Kombinati (35/6 kV), and Cimento (35/6 kV)&#13;
substations. The substations and distribution networks are seriously overloaded, and&#13;
most of the MV/LV substations and cables are obsolete, needing to be replaced urgently.&#13;
The rehabilitation works would include supply and installation of two 110/10 kV&#13;
transformers (15 MVA each), introduction of the 10 kV medium-voltage level to replace&#13;
the 6 kV voltage level, replacement of 150 MV/LV substations, replacement of 95 km&#13;
defective or damaged medium voltage cable and overhead line, 104 km LV cable,&#13;
585 MV power disconnectors, 195 LV automatic circuit breakers, and installation of&#13;
10 MV metal-clad switchgears, and replacement of 195 transformer cabins;&#13;
(v)   Vlore: Vlore is the largest coastal city in Southern Albania, with significant potential of&#13;
developing tourist industry. The city and the rural area, covering about 1,800 square&#13;
kilometers, are supplied by the Vji I Ftohte (110/6 kV) and Selouica (110/35/6 kV)&#13;
substations. The 6 kV distribution network is heavily overloaded, and is in very poor&#13;
condition due to past failures to expand the distribution system in order to keep up with&#13;
the growing demand, and due to repeated postponement of rehabilitation and proper&#13;
maintenance caused by capital scarcity.  The rehabilitation work would include&#13;
replacement of 105 km defective or damaged medium voltage cable and overhead line,&#13;
40 km LV cable, 750 MV power disconnectors, 250 LV automatic circuit breakers, and&#13;
installation of 15 MV metal-clad switchgears and replacement of 270 transformer cabins;&#13;
and&#13;
(vi)   Other major load centers: the component would involve rehabilitation and reinforcement&#13;
of distribution networks in various residential and productive areas in Fier, Berati, Diber,&#13;
Lac, and Sarande. The 35/6 or 35/10 kV medium voltage levels will be kept. During&#13;
rehabilitation, replaced 6 and 10 kV substation equipment from Tirana, Shkoder, and&#13;
Durres will be reused in these areas to substitute for obsolete and overloaded equipment.&#13;
The rehabilitation works would also cover supply and replacement of about 150 km of&#13;
MV cable and about 300 units of LV circuit breakers.&#13;

ALBANIA - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
Project Management Consulting Services: Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.      The Albanian electric power system is experiencing serious operating problems due&#13;
to insufficient development of its subtransmission system and distribution network, and the lack&#13;
of required rehabilitation and reinforcement of its facilities.  The lack of development,&#13;
rehabilitation, and maintenance has persisted for a period of fifteen years. Present facilities are&#13;
significantly reducing operating reliability. Three major existing problems are: (a) serious&#13;
overloading of 110 kV subtransmission facilities and distribution networks resulting in heavy&#13;
losses, voltage drops, power outages and the failure of many distribution transformers; (b)&#13;
abnormal power factor values due to the lack of reactive supply capability on the subtransmission&#13;
and distribution systems; (c) outdated system control and protection equipment and very deficient&#13;
communication facilities threatening system  safety and reliability.  Without an intensive&#13;
rehabilitation of the system, there is a significant risk of major breakdowns.&#13;
2.      The objective of the Transmission and Distribution Project is to assist KESH to carry&#13;
out long delayed rehabilitation and reinforcement of the existing power system facilities in order&#13;
to improve the overall standard and reliability of the electric power service provided by the&#13;
KESH power system, to reduce the occurrence of power system outages and losses, and to&#13;
enhance the efficiency of electricity interchanges with neighboring countries. The project would&#13;
assist in urgently needed rehabilitation and upgrading of transmission, distribution and&#13;
dispatching facilities located in various parts of the country, particularly in the load centers of&#13;
Tirana, Shkoder, Durres, Elbasan and Vlore, and other major load centers of Fieri, Vlore,&#13;
Berati, Diber, Lac and Saranda, where the need is most urgent.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
3.      The Transmission and Distribution Project consists of:&#13;
(i)   a new double-circuit 220 kV line of about 4 km interconnecting Elbasan 1 and&#13;
Elbasan 2 substations (financed by EBRD);&#13;
(ii)   a new double-circuit 110 kV transmission line of about 105 km between&#13;
Elbasan, Cerrik, and Korce, and addition of reactive power compensation&#13;
capacity in the system up to about 30 MVAR (financed by EBRD);&#13;
(iii)  reconstruction and reinforcement of the 110 kV ring connection between Tirana,&#13;
Selite and Traktori substations (financed by EBRD);&#13;
(iv)  a new 220/110 kV substation in Durres (financed by Swiss Government);&#13;
&#13;

Attachment II&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
(v)  rehabilitation and reinforcement of two 220 kV, and sixteen 110 kV existing&#13;
primary substations (financed by OECF);&#13;
(vi)  upgrading of system control facilities (including National Dispatch Center and&#13;
Remote Terminal Units; financed by Italian Government);&#13;
(vii) rehabilitation of distribution networks in major  cities and load centers,&#13;
including Tirana, Durres, Fier, Berati, Diber, Lac and Saranda, and three pilot&#13;
distribution companies for privatization, i.e., Shkoder, Elbasan and Vlora&#13;
(except Tirana to be financed by OECF, other distribution networks will be&#13;
financed by IDA; and&#13;
(viii) spares and special tools for transmission and distribution systems (financed by&#13;
EBRD).&#13;
Engineering and Procurement&#13;
4.      KESH has the capability to carry out most of the engineering and construction&#13;
supervision required for the transmission and distribution works. However, in view of the&#13;
magnitude and complexity of KESH's existing and future operations, there is a need for intensive&#13;
consulting services to assist KESH in detailed design and engineering for the new transmission&#13;
lines, Durres substation and system control facilities. EBRD is providing technical assistance for&#13;
the detailed design and preparation of bidding documents for the transmission facilities. Swiss&#13;
and Italian Governments will provide engineering services through turn-key contracts for the&#13;
Durres substation and system control facilities, respectively. Engineering for rehabilitation works&#13;
are being carried out by KESH's engineers. Procurement of goods and services for the above&#13;
project components financed by the World Bank, EBRD, Italy, and Switzerland would follow&#13;
respectively procedures set out by the World Bank, OECF, EBRD, the Government of Italy, and&#13;
the Government of Switzerland.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
5.      The Project covers the rehabilitation and reinforcement program for the Albanian&#13;
transmission and distribution systems for the period 1996 through year 2000. KESH would be&#13;
responsible for the execution of the Project. A Project Management Unit (PMU), will be set&#13;
up under KESH's management and be responsible for the rehabilitation and reinforcement of the&#13;
transmission system and distribution networks. An office of PMU, responsible for day to day&#13;
management of the Unit, will be established. The PMU would be assisted by consultant services&#13;
under this Terms of Reference. The contract for this consultant services will be signed between&#13;
KESH and the provider. The implementation of the sub-projects would be the responsibility of&#13;
the local transmission and distribution entities. Procurement would be centralized and carried&#13;
out by KESH's Procurement Department, under the PMU's supervision, and deliveries would&#13;
be made directly to the regional warehouses.&#13;

ALBANIA - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Management Plan&#13;
Environmental Impacts of Transmission Line&#13;
1. No erosion was observed. However, soils in the region are susceptible to severe erosion on most&#13;
degrees of slopes if groundcover is not maintained.&#13;
2. New structures may be required between the Tirana Substation and the Tirana-Durres highway in&#13;
order to maintain structural integrity and maintain vertical clearance requirements. Erosion is possible&#13;
although the problem will likely be small.&#13;
3. Impacts to native flora and fauna will be minimal.&#13;
4. Maintenance is conducted manually, no herbicides are used. The proposed project will traverse areas&#13;
of natural vegetation to the northeast of Tirana, temporarily impacting approximately 50 ha of shrub&#13;
vegetation mostly dominated by arbutus and heather. Post construction maintenance will occur on only&#13;
a portion of the vegetated area impacted during construction.&#13;
5. The project traverses agricultural areas. Temporary impacts will occur during construction. These&#13;
temporary impacts could result in the loss of between 5.0 and 8.5 ha of agricultural land. Permanent loss&#13;
of agriculture land will result from the physical presence of transmission structures, and estimated at&#13;
between 0.05 and 0.14 ha.&#13;
6. Land use impacts are characterized as moderate. The existing transmission line alignment traverses&#13;
residential, commercial and industrial land. While there are about 20 residences in the transmission right-&#13;
of-way it will be possible to safely construct, operate and maintain the line without needing to relocate&#13;
them. The new alignments contain no residence. Tirane and Traktori Substations are located in industrial&#13;
areas.&#13;
7.    The potential for health effects from electric and magnetic fields require electric and magnetic&#13;
fields be limited within the right-of-way.&#13;
8.    Impacts to residences and an elementary school will occur in the vicinity of Selite Substation.&#13;
The elementary school is located approximately 100 m south of the substation and will be located adjacent&#13;
to a planned alignment of new transmission right-of-way. Impacts to the residences and school will be&#13;
minimized by careful routing of the lines, double circuiting where feasible, and adhering to established&#13;
electric and magnetic field limitations.&#13;
9.    Future residential development is planned for Tirana to the north, west and south of the existing&#13;
developed areas. Transmission line routing considered these areas to the greatest extent possible.&#13;
10.   Visual impacts are negligible for the existing alignment. Reconductoring will occur and additional&#13;
towers will be required between existing structures. The only areas determined to be visually sensitive&#13;
along the Tirane-Durres Highway, include the Zoological Park and the Botanical Garden which are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -                             Annex 5.9&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
bisected by the existing transmission line ring. Visual change will be minor if the existing line is&#13;
selected, visual impacts will be less if the new alignment is selected that places transmission structures&#13;
to the south of the Park behind low hills. No visual impacts are likely to Dajti National Park.&#13;
11.   Rehabilitation of the Tirane, Selite, and Traktori substations require old transformers and&#13;
capacitors to be replaced. This equipment may contain lubricants/fluids that contain polychlorinated&#13;
biphenyls (PCBs). Analytical tests will need to be conducted on samples to determine the presence of&#13;
PCBs and, if present, its concentration.&#13;
12.   Proper management of PCBs will be required to minimize the potential of contact by construction&#13;
workers if the old equipment is repaired for use in other locations.&#13;
13.   Contamination of soils under the existing equipment was observed at the Traktori substation and&#13;
is suspected at the Tirane and Selite substations. Groundwater may also be potentially contaminated.&#13;
Contaminated soils and groundwater should be remediated during initial stages of rehabilitation and prior&#13;
to installation of new equipment. In addition, steps should be taken immediately to minimize further&#13;
potential contamination.&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
14.    On the basis of the proposed project descriptions, the following recommendations are proposed.&#13;
*      Avoid structure placement on steep slopes susceptible to soil erosion.&#13;
*     Place structures at locations that minimize leveling land to meet vertical clearance&#13;
requirements. Increase structure height in order to minimize leveling land.&#13;
*     Avoid structure placement in areas prone to flooding; enhance foundation requirements&#13;
where structure placement in the floodplain is necessary due to engineering requirements.&#13;
*      Avoid structure placement in wetlands.&#13;
*      Minimize structure placement in areas covered by natural vegetation.&#13;
*      Minimize construction of access/maintenance roads.&#13;
Place new structures in agricultural areas with the intent to minimize disruption to&#13;
irrigation systems and established field management practices. Align transmission line&#13;
along field boundaries, roads, and canals where possible.&#13;
*      Minimize the extent and duration of land clearing and leveling. Where clearing of land&#13;
is required, revegetate the area with native flora or crops. Manually clear vegetation and&#13;
sell firewood where the clearing of trees are required. Cut trunks flush with surface and&#13;
retain roots in place to minimize soil erosion/sedimentation.&#13;
*      Herbicides shall be prohibited for clearing right-of-way prior to construction.&#13;
*      During operation, maintain vegetation by manual or mechanized means to the extent&#13;
necessary to maintain horizontal and vertical clearances.&#13;
*      Maintain access roads or restore land to previous condition.&#13;
*      Schedule construction activities to occur during periods of the year when fields are fallow&#13;
to minimize crop loss or interference with agricultural activities.&#13;
*      Vertical conductor clearances shall be maintained where olive trees exist or are planned&#13;
to minimize interference with the management/production of the olive trees.&#13;
*      Where structures are located in visually sensitive areas, structures should be designed,&#13;
located or painted in order to maintain or improve the scenic quality of the area and&#13;
minimize visual impact. This mitigation should occur in the vicinity of the Botanical&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 7&#13;
Garden, Zoological Park and Dajti National Park if structures are determined to be&#13;
visible.&#13;
*     The maximum electric field at the edge of the transmission line right-of-way should not&#13;
exceed 2.0 kV/m. The maximum electric field within the right-of-way shall not exceed&#13;
8 kV/m. The maximum magnetic field at the edge of the transmission line right-of-way&#13;
should not exceed 150 milliGauss, based on maximum current rating, highest operating&#13;
voltage for all transmission circuits, and conductors at their lowest point.&#13;
*     It is not expected that any residences in the transmission right-of-way will need to be&#13;
relocated. If any relocation is required, it should occur in a manner consistent with&#13;
World Bank resettlement guidelines. Under World Bank guidelines, displaced persons&#13;
should be: (i) compensated for their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual&#13;
move; (ii) assisted with the move and supported during the transition period in the&#13;
resettlement site; and (iii) assisted in their efforts to improve their former living&#13;
standards, income earning capacity, and production levels, or at least to restore them.&#13;
*      Engineering design and construction of the transmission line should comply with&#13;
appropriate health and safety standards that protect the welfare of the general public.&#13;
-      Substation equipment proposed for removal must be secured prior to transport in order&#13;
to minimize leaking fluids. If equipment is to be repaired or renovated, it shall be tested&#13;
for the presence of PCBs. If PCBs are present, contaminated constituents shall be&#13;
replaced. PCB-contaminated media shall be properly disposed. KESH should implement&#13;
procedures identified in the PCB Management Plan (Annex 5.10) if PCBs are determined&#13;
to be present.&#13;
Environmental Impacts of Durres Substation&#13;
15.   The proposed Durres Substation site is well suited for construction of a 220/1 10-kV substation.&#13;
The site is located on the periphery of dense development, has access to a principal highway, and is also&#13;
situated adjacent to the existing Tirana-Fieri 220-kV transmission line.&#13;
16.    Construction impacts to the physical environment will be minor since the land is generally flat&#13;
to gently sloping and an existing drainage ditch conveys most offsite stormwater around the perimeter&#13;
of the site. Plans to regrade the site will need to include maintaining the existing perimeter drainage&#13;
system and accommodate offsite runoff from the southwest.&#13;
17.    Construction impacts to the biological environment will be minor since there are no natural&#13;
vegetation communities on the site.&#13;
18.    Construction of the proposed substation will require relocation of one residence. In addition two&#13;
military bunkers occupy the extreme southwest portion of the site and may need to be removed. There&#13;
are no short-term agricultural impacts since the site presently exists as fallow field.&#13;
19.   Construction and operation impacts to the adjacent land uses are also minor. Transportation,&#13;
utility, and government land exist to the north, east and south respectively. This is considered compatible&#13;
with substation development. Several residential dwellings coexist with the existing 220- and 35-kV&#13;
transmission lines and will be located adjacent to the proposed substation. Construction and operation&#13;
of the substation will have minor noise and visual impacts to these dwellings.&#13;
Recommendations&#13;

- 104 -                           Annex 5.9&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
20.   The Durres Substation site should be visited every 2 weeks to insure no unauthorized occupation&#13;
occurs onsite and no additional changes are undertaken by new or existing residents.&#13;
21.  KESH should construct a perimeter fence to deter any further occupation. Resettlement assistance&#13;
should be provided to occupants of the onsite residence consistent with World Bank policies (paragraph&#13;
14).&#13;
22.   A solid wall should be constructed along the east boundary of the site to minimize noise and&#13;
visual impacts to the existing nearby residences.&#13;
Institutional Assignments&#13;
23.   The Institute of Energy was responsible for preparation of the environmental analysis of the 1 10-&#13;
and 220-kV transmission line and Durres Substation components of the comprehensive power transmission&#13;
and distribution project. The institute does not have any trained environmental professionals.&#13;
24.   KESH has limited capability to conduct environmental studies. Current capabilities are focused&#13;
on water treatment at the thermal power plants. Analytical capabilities are modest and antiquated; there&#13;
is no central testing laboratory.&#13;
25.   To successfully implement the recommendations in this Environmental Management Plan,&#13;
additional staff and analytical capabilities are required. Pending results of the PCB study, between one&#13;
and two environmental specialists are recommended.&#13;
26.   One individual should specialize in land management and be responsible for:&#13;
-     Review of planning/design studies to ensure environmental compliance with siting,&#13;
structure placement, construction activities that minimize erosion, and impacts to&#13;
agriculture;&#13;
-     Coordination of resettlement activities;&#13;
-     (Conducting monitoring activities and preparing reports of construction and monitoring&#13;
events; and&#13;
*     After construction is complete, monitoring environmental conditions and performance;&#13;
27.   If PCBs are present at the substations, a second individual should be considered who would be&#13;
responsible for:&#13;
*     Implementing the PCB Management Plan, by retaining a qualified consultant, and&#13;
assuring completion of the study according to the Terms of Reference; and&#13;
*     Implementing any PCB or PCB contaminated soils disposal or remediation actions&#13;
required by findings of the PCB Management Plan.&#13;
28.   These trained specialists should report to the Director of Production and Transmission at KESH.&#13;
29.   To conduct specific activities associated with implementation of the Environmental Management&#13;
Plan, the following equipment is necessary:&#13;

Implementation Schedule&#13;
34.   Implementation of the Environmental Management Plan should commence immediately.&#13;
Enviromnental considerations identified in the Energy Institute's Environmental Analysis and this&#13;
Environmental Management Plan should be evaluated by KESH management prior to selecting the final&#13;
alignments for the Tirana Ring Connector. Siting and design considerations in the recommendations&#13;
section of this plan should be implemented.&#13;
35.   Specifications for erosion control should be developed during transmission line and design tasks.&#13;
Relocation should occur after design has been approved (and the number of residences identified) and&#13;
prior to construction commencement.&#13;
36.   The PCB Management Plan should be initiated once the loan agreement is completed. The&#13;
conduct of tasks associated with the presence of PCBs in transformer fluids, soils, and groundwater can&#13;
be conducted as soon as the consultant has been retained, analytical equipment purchased, and the training&#13;
completed. Disposal and remediation activities should occur prior to or during the initial stages of&#13;
construction to minimize impacts on the schedule.&#13;
Monitoring And Reporting&#13;
37.   Monitoring is required prior to, during, and after construction is complete.&#13;
38.   Monitoring the transmission line rights-of-way and Durres Substation site for additional illegal&#13;
occupation by residences should be initiated immediately and continue every 2 weeks until resettlement&#13;
begins prior to construction to prevent further occupation. Other environmental management&#13;
recommendations should be monitored at varying frequencies during construction. Monitoring of electric&#13;
and magnetic fields, noise, and occupation of the right-of-way should occur after construction is complete&#13;
and the transmission line and substation are in operation.&#13;
39.   On a monthly basis and during normal operating conditions (i.e., electrical load demand), electric&#13;
and magnetic fields and noise should be monitored at the edge of right-of-way or substation parcel&#13;
boundary where it is generally accessible to the public (roads, residential areas, community facilities,&#13;
including the school at Selite Substation and the Great Park of Tirana). A minimum of 12 locations for&#13;
monitoring should be established and should include each substation site. Monitoring should be&#13;
conducted by the proposed land management specialist. Records of each monitoring event shall be kept,&#13;
provided to the Bank as described below, and maintained.&#13;
40.   Monitoring the right-of-way for illegal occupation should occur along the entire alignment on a&#13;
monthly basis. The proposed land management specialist can monitor illegal occupation during other&#13;
monitoring events and should conduct this activity until illegal occupation stops.&#13;
41.   Monitoring the implementation of environmental management recommendations should be&#13;
reported to the World Bank according to the terms of the Credit. Environmental monitoring should be&#13;
reported every other month prior to construction commencement, monthly during construction, and every&#13;
other month for 1 year after construction is complete and facilities operating.&#13;

ALBANIA - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
PCB Management Plan: Terms of Reference&#13;
Preparation of PCB Management Plan&#13;
1.   If PCBs are found in transformers currently in the KESH system, KESH shall prepare&#13;
a PCB Management Plan to minimize the harmful affects of PCB compounds to humans and the&#13;
natural environment. The contents of the plan and the procedures to be implemented shall be&#13;
consistent with the outline and guidance provided below. A draft plan shall be submitted to the&#13;
World Bank 3 months prior to implementation for review and approval. The plan shall be&#13;
finalized at least 2 months prior to construction commencement at any substation affected by the&#13;
rehabilitation project and implemented prior to construction. KESH's capabilities to manage the&#13;
activities and conduct specific activities are being enhanced through the technical assistance&#13;
program component of the project.&#13;
PCB Management Plan Contents&#13;
2.    Given the potential adverse human health and environmental impacts from exposure to&#13;
PCB compounds, this management plan addresses the determination of PCB compound&#13;
occurrence in the areas of interest. The management plan shall contain two primary sections,&#13;
l) the confirmation of the presence of PCB compounds in transformers, fluid storage, and&#13;
recycling facilities and management of PCB-contaminated transformers and fluids, and 2) the&#13;
management of PCB-contaminated soils and groundwater.&#13;
Presence and Management of PCB-Contaminated Transformers and Fluids&#13;
3.    The physical removal and rehabilitation of the existing transformers may expose workers&#13;
to PCB compounds in the effort to remove the dielectric fluid and replace it with PCB-free&#13;
fluids. The content of PCB compounds in the existing stock of transformer fluid and new&#13;
supplies of transformer fluid purchased by KESH must also be characterized to avoid inadvertent&#13;
contamination of equipment and exposure of workers. Activities proposed for evaluation of&#13;
transformer fluids are presented below:&#13;
* Describe the current transformer fluid handling and storage practices, including&#13;
sources of purchased virgin fluid and recycled fluid removed from transformers. An&#13;
inventory of storage location(s) shall be prepared to quantify the volume of transformer&#13;
fluid used on an annual basis. A list of workers that handle or are potentially exposed&#13;
to transformer fluid shall also be developed.&#13;
* Describe current practices used to recycle transformer fluids, including equipment&#13;
typically used to handle and transport the fluids. Prepare an estimate of the volume&#13;
of transformer fluid that is recycled on an annual basis and describe how the recycled&#13;
fluid is stored and handled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -                          Annex 5.10&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
* Describe how KESH workers intend to rehabilitate and reuse PCB-contaminated&#13;
transformers, transformer and rehabilitation equipment decontamination procedures,&#13;
and potential worker exposure.  Describe the effectiveness of attempting to&#13;
decontaminate transformers that contained PCB compounds, cost for disposal of&#13;
contaminated equipment and materials, and potential exposure of KESH workers.&#13;
* Prepare a methodology for collection of representative sampies of transformer fluids&#13;
in current KESH inventory. Collect individual samples from virgin fluid purchased&#13;
from suppliers, recycled fluid handled by KESH workers, and each transformer that&#13;
is designated for replacement as part of this project.&#13;
* Evaluate and select appropriate laboratory analysis methodologies that will provide an&#13;
adequate detection level for collected transformer fluid samples.  Identify the&#13;
equipment that will allow KESH workers to conduct the analyses or locate laboratories&#13;
that have the capabilities to conduct the required analyses.&#13;
* Develop criteria for classification of transformer fluid as non-PCB- or PCB-&#13;
contaminated based on the concentration of PCB compounds reported for individual&#13;
samples by selected analytical method. Classification criteria shall address potential&#13;
exposure pathways to KESH workers, adjacent residents, and the natural environment.&#13;
* Evaluate remediation alternatives for PCB-contaminated transformer fluid. Identify&#13;
facilities that can provide environmentally acceptable and cost-effective disposal.&#13;
Provide an estimate of disposal costs for the anticipated volume of PCB-contaminated&#13;
fluids in the KESH inventory.&#13;
Presence and Management of PCB-Contaminated Soils and groundwater&#13;
4.    Construction activities at the individual transformer sites may also expose workers to&#13;
PCB-contaminated soils during activities to construct concrete supports for the new transformers.&#13;
The potential presence of PCB compounds in groundwater utilized by local residents for drinking&#13;
or irrigation supplies represents an exposure pathway that shall be evaluated.  Activities&#13;
proposed for evaluation of PCB-contaminated soil and groundwater are presented below:&#13;
* Inspect the individual transformers that are planned to be replaced at the substation&#13;
locations. Transformer condition shall be described, including physical appearance,&#13;
visible evidence of rust, transformer fluid leakage, and staining of surrounding soils.&#13;
Observe the areas adjacent to the transformer locations to determine the nearest use&#13;
of groundwater as a source of drinking or irrigation supply.&#13;
* Prepare a methodology for collection of soil samples from visibly stained areas directly&#13;
adjacent to the individual transformers. Composite samples of near-surface soils shall&#13;
be collected from the most visibly stained areas to characterize areas most likely&#13;
affected by transformer fluid leakage. Sample collection and compositing techniques&#13;
shall be conducted in a manner that provides a representative sample, minimizes&#13;
potential cross-contamination between transformer locations, and does not bias the&#13;
analytical data by sample handling.&#13;
* Prepare a methodology for collection of groundwater samples from drinking or&#13;
irrigation supply wells that are physically located nearest to the individual&#13;
transformers. Sample collection shall be conducted in a manner that provides a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -                          Annex 5.10&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
representative sample, minimizes potential cross-contanination between transformer&#13;
locations, and does not bias the analytical data by sample handling.&#13;
* Evaluate and select appropriate laboratory analysis methodologies that will provide an&#13;
adequate detection level for collected transformer fluid samples. Identify equipment&#13;
that will allow KESH workers to conduct the analyses or locate laboratories that have&#13;
the capabilities to conduct the required analyses.&#13;
* Develop criteria for classification of soil and groundwater as non-PCB- or PCB-&#13;
contaminated based on the concentration of PCB compounds reported for individual&#13;
samples by selected analytical method. Classification criteria shall address potential&#13;
exposure pathways to KESH workers, adjacent residents, and the natural environment.&#13;
* Prepare a methodology for delineating the horizontal and vertical extent of soil&#13;
contamination at transformer locations where the corresponding composite soil sample&#13;
was determined to exceed the criteria for classification of PCB contamination.&#13;
Characterization of the extent of contamination will indicate the volume of soil that&#13;
shall be removed prior to installation of the new transformer.&#13;
v Prepare a methodology for excavating and handling PCB-contaminated soil at the&#13;
transformer locations. Evaluate remediation alternatives (centralized storage and&#13;
encapsulation, on-site treatment, landfilling, incineration) and identify facilities that can&#13;
provide environmentally acceptable off-site treatment (landfilling or incineration).&#13;
Provide an estimate of disposal costs for the anticipated volume of PCB-contaminated&#13;
soils generated at the transformer locations.&#13;
Prepare Report of Findings&#13;
5.    The PCB Management Report of findings shall be concise and limited to significant&#13;
environmental issues. The main text shall focus on methodologies implemented, findings,&#13;
conclusions, and recommended actions, supported by summaries of the data collected and&#13;
citations for any references used in interpreting the data.  Detailed or uninterpreted data&#13;
(laboratory reports) are not appropriate in the main text and should be presented in appendices&#13;
or a separate volume. The PCB Management Report should include the following elements:&#13;
* Executive summary&#13;
* Description of findings of PCB-contaminated transformer fluid, soil, and groundwater&#13;
* Significant environmental impacts&#13;
* Analysis of alternatives&#13;
* Mitigation plan&#13;

ALBANIA - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT    Paae 1 of 4&#13;
Assumptions for Projected Financial Statements (KESH)&#13;
General&#13;
1.   Actual Financial Statements for the years 1992 -- 94&#13;
are based on figures originating from KESH in close&#13;
cooperation with Electrowatt. The estimated figures for 1995&#13;
are also based on information from KESH, with adjustments&#13;
made for the actual result for consumption of energy, losses&#13;
for three financial quarters as well as the arrears.&#13;
2.   Prolected Financial Statements  for KESH have been&#13;
prepared in terms of current Leks. It has been assumed that&#13;
annual domestic inflation will reach 10% in 1996 and 8% in&#13;
the following years. The average exchange rate is assumed to&#13;
show the following development:&#13;
1996:     103 leks per US$    1998:        107  leks per US$&#13;
1997:     105 leks per US$    1999:        110  leks per US$&#13;
3.   The distribution companies of Elbasan, Shkoder, and&#13;
Vlore are not included in KESH-s accounts from January 1,&#13;
1996.&#13;
Income Statements&#13;
4.   OperatincT Revenues have been calculated on the basis of&#13;
the following assumptions:&#13;
(i) The total supply of energy in Albania will remain&#13;
unchanged during the project period.&#13;
(ii) Total energy losses will be reduced in accordance&#13;
with the prognoses made for the Power Loss Reduction&#13;
Project, but with a one-year delay.&#13;
(iii) The total demand for energy increases at the same&#13;
pace as the energy losses diminish.&#13;
(iv) The price per kWh for 1996 will be set at an&#13;
average of 4.5 leks and will thereafter be maintained at&#13;
this level in real terms.&#13;
5.   Operating Expenses have been calculated on the basis of&#13;
the following assumptions:&#13;
(i) Cost of salaries and wages: Salaries will increase&#13;
by 5k per annum in real terms and the number of employees&#13;
will remain at the present level of 9,900 (minus the number&#13;
of employees in the three distribution companies: Elbasan,&#13;
&#13;

Annex 6.4&#13;
-125-                           PaRe 2 of 4&#13;
Shkoder, and Vlore).&#13;
(ii) Fuel prices will increase at the same rate as&#13;
inflation. The total usage for 1996 will be approx. 300 Gwh&#13;
but will then fall to 260 Gwh per annum.&#13;
(iii) Material costs are estimated to rise by 10% per&#13;
annum in real terms.&#13;
6.   The Excise Tax  will be abolished during 1996 and will&#13;
be replaced by a V.A.T. of 12.5%. The Ministry of Finance&#13;
has stated a requirement of 2,200 million Leks from KESH in&#13;

7. Beginning in 1996 the fixed assets and accumulated&#13;
depreciations have been revalued upwards to 3.2 times their.&#13;
previous value. The annual depreciations from 1996 are based&#13;
on these new values.&#13;
8.   The investment program for 1996 - 99, including&#13;
information about financing, has been submitted by KESH.&#13;
Investments for the period 2000 - 2002 have been set at xxx&#13;
per year.&#13;
9.   Accounts Receivable correspond to a credit period of 60&#13;
days.&#13;
10. Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable correspond to a&#13;
credit period of 45 days.&#13;
Cash Flow Statements&#13;
10. Debt Service in the form of repayment of the principal&#13;
for the project in question will begin in 2000. The interest&#13;
on these loans will be paid during the entire period and&#13;
will be 8% p.a.&#13;
11. Cash surplus not needed within the company will become&#13;

Assumptions for Projected Financial Statements (The&#13;
distribution companies of Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore)&#13;
General&#13;
1.   Actual Financial Statements for the years 1993 - 94&#13;
are based on figures from Financial Statements (Income&#13;
Statements and Balance Sheets) for the three companies. The&#13;
Cash Flow Statements were derived from these statements and&#13;
complemented with other data submitted by the companies.&#13;
Elimination of internal transactions between the three&#13;
distribution companies and the rest of the KESH group has&#13;
not been carried out.&#13;
2.   Prolected Financial Statements  have been prepared in&#13;
terms of current Leks. Assumptions concerning inflation,&#13;
currency rates, interest, revaluation of fixed assets, etc.,&#13;
are the same as for KESH (See annex 6.1).&#13;
Income Statements&#13;
4.   Operating Revenues have been calculated on the basis of&#13;
the following assumptions:&#13;
(i) The total supply of energy to the three&#13;
distribution companies will remain unchanged during the&#13;
project period.&#13;
(ii) Total power losses will be reduced in accordance&#13;
with the prognoses made for the Power Loss Reduction&#13;
Project, which means that in 2000 losses will have been&#13;
reduced to 18%.&#13;
(iii) The total demand for energy increases at the same&#13;
pace as the energy losses diminish.&#13;
(iv) The price per kWh is assumed to be the same as for&#13;
KESH for the period 1996 - 2002.&#13;
5.   Operating Expenses have been calculated on the basis of&#13;
the following assumptions:&#13;
(i) A margin between the retail and bulk prices,&#13;
excluding excise taxes but including VAT, has been set at&#13;
2.70 leks/kWh in 1996 and thereafter adjusted annually for&#13;
inflation.&#13;
(ii) The excise tax for energy from the three&#13;
distribution companies from Jan 1, 1996 to the date of its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

abolishment will be paid by KESH at the bulk price.&#13;
(iii) A VAT of 12.5% will be paid from July 1, 1996.&#13;

ALBANIA - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
Financial Management of KESH&#13;
Financial management is currently almost non-existent in KESH, due to a shortage of&#13;
qualified staff and the complexity of pulling together accounting information from 45&#13;
divisions spread throughout the country. The task is further complicated by the weakness of&#13;
Albania's telecommunications infrastructure and the serious shortage of computer equipment&#13;
in KESH.&#13;
Improvement of KESH's financial management is now recognized to be a critical&#13;
necessity. The entity is a major source of revenue for the Treasury but apprears to be, at the&#13;
same time, in an almost desperate liquidity situation. Reduction and eventual elimination of&#13;
the excise tax would leave KESH with larger amounts of money at its disposal, which must&#13;
be wisely spent and carefully accounted for. The management of KESH needs to have access&#13;
to reliable and up to date financial information. They, and KESH's lenders, need to receive&#13;
unqualified year-end financial statements in a timely fashion.&#13;
The first attempt to significantly improve KESH's financial management, which was&#13;
grant-financed by the Swiss Government, did not succeed. Although a new chart of accounts&#13;
was prepared, introduction was not possible, primarily due to a lack of qualified counterpart&#13;
staff.&#13;
The major investments proposed to be undertaken in the electricity sector, and the&#13;
recent corporatization of KESH, demand that this situation be rectified urgently. Given that it&#13;
has been proven to be impossible to achieve this with existing staff and locally available&#13;
expertise, this must be done with outside help. Such help must be of sufficieiit magnitude to&#13;
provide a critical mass of people that is able to achieve tangible results relatively quickly.&#13;
Hence, under the IDA credit an amount of US$3.5 million would be allocated for this&#13;
purpose.&#13;
KESH would issue invitations for proposals, which could be bid for by accounting&#13;
firms and electric utilities worldwide. The expatriate experts would have to reside in Albania&#13;
for the duration of their contract. At the end of their term, the experts should have trained&#13;
an adequate number of local staff to be able to gradually take over the financial management&#13;
of KESH.&#13;
The tasks would cover, inter alia, the following subjects:&#13;
Accounting&#13;
Treasury Function&#13;
Organization of KESH's finance department and flow of data between&#13;
headquarters and divisions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -                          Annex 6.5&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
Billing and collection systems&#13;
Staff training in the above, including in the use of computers.&#13;
Although the final responsibility for the financial management of KESH would remain&#13;
with KESH's management, the terms of the contract should snsure that substantial&#13;
repsonsibility for improving KESH's financial management is given to the expert team, along&#13;
with the cooperation and other means required.&#13;
The estimated budget is:&#13;
-     expatriate staff&#13;
-     overhead, equipment, travel&#13;
-     local staff&#13;
-     100 computers&#13;

ALBANIA - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
Evaluation of Project Scenarios&#13;
The project risks may be clarified by considering the consequences of the following&#13;
scenarios:&#13;
(i) Procurement delays. These delays would not affect the project rate of return in the&#13;
typical case since they would occur prior to expenditures being made and hence would&#13;
not increase the period between expenditures and benefits.  However, delays in&#13;
procurement of particular items would lengthen the period between expenditures and&#13;
benefits for linked items that have already been procured but cannot be put into operation&#13;
until the particular items are installed. The rate of return is highly robust with respect&#13;
to such delays. It would take a five year delay in benefits after the investments are made&#13;
to reduce the rate of return to 12%. Although the rate of return is robust with respect&#13;
to delays, there would be an adverse impact on electricity consumers resulting from&#13;
postponement of improvements in supply reliability.&#13;
(ii) Delayed availability of counterpart funds. This would hold up the installation of&#13;
equipment procured under the project and thereby increase the period between&#13;
expenditures and benefits. As mentioned above, the rate of return is highly robust with&#13;
respect to such delays.&#13;
(iii) Delayed or reduced cofinancing. Since EBRD has already approved its part of the&#13;
project, this scenario concerns only possible delays or reductions by Italy, Switzerland&#13;
and OECF. Because of only partial interdependence among project components, it would&#13;
be possible to accommodate delays or reductions in most of the components of the&#13;
cofinanciers without causing adverse impact on rates of return for the other components&#13;
of the project. However, if the Swiss Govemment were to delay, it would be desirable&#13;
for another cofinancier to take responsibility for technical assistance for the Project&#13;
Management Unit, since this assistance is needed from the time the project starts.&#13;
Reduced cofinancing would require a reduction in project scope and could entail some&#13;
reallocation of project components among the remaining cofinanciers, including IDA, in&#13;
order to ensure that the highest priority components proceed. In particular, if OECF&#13;
decided not to cofinance, it would be desirable for the remaining cofinanciers to make&#13;
adjustments in order to come up with at least partial financing for the Tirana distribution&#13;
system and the critically needed transmission system equipment included in the OECF&#13;
part of the project. If the Swiss Government decided not to cofinance, it would probably&#13;
be desirable for another cofinancier to finance the Durres substation because of its critical&#13;
importance for removing bottlenecks in supplies to Durres and Tirana. To summarize,&#13;
delayed or reduced cofinancing could cause inconvenient changes in project scope and&#13;
the&#13;
&#13;

reallocation of components among cofinanciers, but would not adversely affect the project&#13;
rate of return.&#13;
(iv) Delay in securing the rights of way for three transmission lines. This delay&#13;
would not affect the rates of return for these components, nor for the other components&#13;
of the project.  But it would mean a delay in bringing relief to consumers from&#13;
transmission system outages.&#13;
(v) Increase in unpaid electricity consumption. This would lead to an increase in&#13;
demand resulting in increased outages originating in unstrengthened parts of the power&#13;
system (e.g., generation) and/or investments that would not be required if consumers had&#13;
been forced to pay for their electricity consumption. The project would still yield the&#13;
same benefits in terms of reduced transmission and distribution system outages and losses&#13;
at any given level of demand compared to the existing system. But this improvement&#13;
would not be noticeable to consumers if the increased demand leads to outages in the&#13;
generation system or overloading of the new transmission and distribution facilities.&#13;
Despite the possibility of these outcomes, it would not be appropriate to delay the project&#13;
for the following reasons: (i) the current outages are causing much equipment damage&#13;
which could be avoided by the strengthened capacity and protective equipment provided&#13;
by the project; (ii) continued unreliable electricity supply will hamper economic growth&#13;
and lead to costly expenditures on backup generators; (iii) there are signs that loss&#13;
reduction campaigns are beginning to succeed (para. 33); and (iv) the project is needed&#13;
to meet the demand expected to result when unpaid electricity consumption is brought&#13;
under control.&#13;
An estimate was made of the economic rate of return from proceeding with the project&#13;
now compared to postponing by one year. The benefits come from advancing by one&#13;
year the reduction in transmission and distribution losses and outages. The cost is the&#13;
loss in interest, measured at the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12%, resulting&#13;
from advancing by one year the use of project investment funds in the project. The rate&#13;
of return was estimated to be 160%. This estimate is conservative since it does not take&#13;
account of the benefit of avoided equipment damages.&#13;
(vi) Problems relating to the transition to private ownership. Two scenarios are&#13;
considered for the three pilot companies. (a) Possible delays in implementing and&#13;
reporting on their project components because of inexperience with Bank procurement&#13;
and disbursement procedures, modern accounting techniques, etc. In order to avoid these&#13;
difficulties KESH has agreed to handle procurement and disbursements on behalf of the&#13;
pilot companies for equipment purchased under the project and to provide assistance in&#13;
other areas (para. 59). However, there may still be a need for considerable supervision&#13;
by Bank staff. (b) Possible financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
Annex 7.2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
difficulties leading, for example, to delay in paying KESH for electricity supplies.&#13;
These difficulties could arise if the companies fail to meet their loss reduction targets.&#13;
However, the pilot companies have been granted generous distribution margins, and the&#13;
distribution licenses (para. 58) have provisions to deal with such situations.  The&#13;
likelihood of either of these scenarios occurring will be reduced when strategic investors&#13;
are found for these companies. (c) Another scenario, which is in fact expected, is that&#13;
other distribution companies may be separated from KESH and privatized during&#13;
the period of project disbursements. While this outcome may require some amendments&#13;
to the legal agreements with IDA and other cofinanciers, similar arrangements could be&#13;
made with these distribution companies for implementation of the project as with the pilot&#13;
companies.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Power Transmission and Distribution
            Project's objectives include: i) improving the overall
            standard, reliability and efficiency of electric power
            supply and enhance the efficiency of electricity
            interchanges with neighboring countries; ii) reducing
            unbilled electricity consumption; iii) establishing a
            regulatory framework for the power sector; iv) beginning the
            process of privatizing the Albanian Electroenergetic
            Corporation (KESH) in an efficient and non-disruptive way;
            v) ensuring the financial viability and institutional
            strength of KESH and the Power Corporations of Elbasan,
            Shkoder and Vlore; and vi) encouraging energy conservation
            and efficiency in electric appliances and buildings. The
            project components include: a) power sector regulatory
            reform and actions leading to privatization and
            institutional strengthening; b) technical assistance for: i)
            privatization and regulatory training of the Ministry of
            Mineral and Energy Resources (MME), ii) management of
            KESH's financial department, and iii) engineering,
            project implementation management and training; and c)
            transmission, dispatching system and distribution system investments.
